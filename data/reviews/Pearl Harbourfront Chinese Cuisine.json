{"text":"Points for view. View of the lake, beautiful in the summer months. Great after lunch walk to work off that food you just ate.   Prices are quite expensive and it's not really worth the price. Eggplant in that yummy sauce contained pork. Pork? Isn't it supposed to be fish? I prefer the fish version.   Ha gow wrap is sticky and mushy. Stuck to my chopsticks and made for an embarrassing moment when the ha gow was stuck to my bowl and I couldn't dig it out. It fell apart and I had to chisel it off the bowl. Ugh.   Service is a bit slow - they have plenty of staff - when my request for hot sauce didn't come after a few of our dishes did, I had to remind the server. Few minutes past and still nothing. Asked the waitress and she got it for me - finally!  Parking is expensive down there. Might want to leave the car at home and just walk or take the transit if you're in the downtown. area."}
{"text":"This is average dim sum nothing spectacular. I Originally came here because of Pearl at Bayview Village which I really like and should review......but this place isn't run the same.  First the restaurant needs some reno's carpet floors, dingy furniture its a little tired.  I could live with that if the dim sum was good but it just wasn't."}
{"text":"My go to place for  dim sum .  But yiu go at night it is more beautiful with the view and you don't see everything everything in everything in lake Ontario.    Service was spot on.    We ordered shrimp dumplings sui Mai,  beef rice noodles,  spring rolls and Chiken feet.  But don't come here if you are really hungry since it can get expensive. Or you have a person that order way  too much and them take it home &never eat it   I would come more often but I live uptown ,"}
{"text":"Okay Service.  Great view. Slightly pricy alacarte menu. Very reasonable weekday lunch menu.  Yummy greasy noodles. Excellent dims um."}
{"text":"View is amazing, food is great but unfortunately we received terrible service, not sure if it was the time when we walked in (3pm) or the waiter was trying to be the douche of the month or something. He made us feel so uncomfortable that we literally had to finish our food quickly and leave. So that's why I'm giving 3 stars. They should improve their customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum with a great view. Quite reasonable as well. $53 for 2 people with tea. Rice noodle dim sum was excellent as was the BBQ bao. The bok choy needed more flavor although the crispy garlic in it was great. Service was quick."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere with an amazing water view. Very good dimsum. The dinner here is also very good. The only issue I had was that the price was a bit steep. But that's what you get for the spectacular view!"}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum in the city, their cart service is great and offer big selection of quality dim sum.  You can order off the menu too if there is something you haven't seen come around.  It is a little more expensive but you can't beat it, and the view is perfect for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Basically the only thing going for this place is the view. The dim sum prices are significantly  more than any other place in Toronto and the quality is mediocre at best. You will find better tasting dim sum in China Town or definitely in Markham/Richmond Hill. Service is also borderline and they charge you for tea. But I love the view and I live nearby so Ive been to this place a few times for a lack of better options."}
{"text":"Was feeling like dimsum on a saturday morning, so my hubby and I decided to check out pearl. With a groupon deal in hand, we got there just before the lunch time crowd. We got seated overlooking the Toronto harbour area with a view of nice boats and docked tallships.   The service here was quite prompt and surprisingly nice. We ordered from the menu, but also picked out some dishes from the dimsum carts. We got pork dumplings and steamed buns. The pork ribs were mainly cartilage and bones, which we were not a fan of. We got a few other sides. For our sweet tooth, we got the sesame balls, freshly made and delicious.   Overall, although the price was on the higher end, the service, food and the view was well worth it."}
{"text":"Flavourful, good quality food and nice view.  Service was fast and friendly.  We look forward to our next visit!  The fried taro dumpling had a bit of curry chicken in it, and the cheung foon had nice texture with delicious sauce.  The BBQ Pork Buns were amazing.  Good portion sizes, and they are generous with the amount of shrimp, meat and veggies."}
{"text":"I took a day off from work to visit this restaurant with my in-laws.  Wife made a reservation at 11.  Surprised by a rude greeting at the front, claiming our name is not on the reservation list.  End up it's a confusion between first name and last name, but the whole conversation is not polite at all.  Food (dim sum) is fair, definitely have better choices for similar price.  The lake view is excellent, no doubt on this.  The worst part of service came at the end, we were asked not in a polite manner if we are going to order more food.  It was close to noon, not even an hour since we have a seat.  Then the bill passed to us without our request.  Terrible service in my opinion."}
{"text":"You'd think this is a horrible tourist trap restaurant but it's not at all.  My experiences with the Pearl are restricted to dim sum but I have family that are regulars there for dinner and love it.  The strength of their dim sum is probably the shu mai (sp?).  I'm not sure what they do to make it that delicious but the piece of shrimp on top can't hurt.  The single pea on top of each one is a bit strange and I assume it's there for aesthetic purposes mostly.  Looking at the normal dim sum criteria the Pearl ranks well.  They served us tea automatically when we sat down.  There were no forks to be seen anywhere on our table.  Carts moved quickly.  I was slightly concerned on my last trip that the asian percentage of restaurant patrons appears to have sank quite a bit since my last visit.  Not sure if that's a trend or an aberration.  If you're downtown this is one of the better places to go for dim sum.  Good change of pace from the cluster on Spadina and probably much less risk in the way of major health violations compared to over there..."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday dim dum and it was good. It is a nice & clean Chinese restaurant with a great view. You pay for the view, the food is a bit pricey. If you find yourself walking around Harbourfront craving dim sum, pop in."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Pearl Harbourfront Chinese Restaurant, especially about their fantastic view and dim sums. I was there during lunch time on Thursday.  Food: - I ordered few dishes from the dim sum menu; Har Kau, Siu Mai, Steamed Spareribs w. Blackbean Sauce, Steamed BBQ Pork Bun, Pan Fried Turnip Cake, Shrimp Cheung Foon, and Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf. All of these dishes can be similarly tasted in other Dim Sum restaurants. But prices of dim sums are not disputable, since they had spectacular view point.   Service: - I am concerned with their service. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all when I was there. The waiting staffs were not rude, but they were very slow with the service and was hard to get attention of even when they were standing very close to my table. Also they were not aware of what guests were in needs of (we were not provided with soy sauce, spoons, and individual sauce dishes). If not service, I would have given four stars to this restaurant.   Atmosphere: - It's not the cleanest restaurant in Toronto. BUT during day time, when there is sunshine, the lake view is spectacular. I would definitely go back just for the view.   In sum, it is enjoyable dim sum lunch  with the great view of CN tower and the lake."}
{"text":"I would have liked to give Pearl a better review, being one of the few \"upscale\" Chinese restaurants in downtown Toronto.  Unfortunately, the only thing that was excellent about Pearl was the view.  Wonderful vistas of the harbour and buskers down below on the harbourfront.  If this is your idea of a good dining establishment, then Pearl should be your choice.  For the rest of us, I would recommend finding an alternate.    The menu was replete with your typical cantonese dishes.  For the price and the pretension that Pearl tries to exude, I would have expected some creativity in the menu.  Unfortunately, that was not included in the price.    And ouch the price.  $30.00 for a large fish maw soup???  I've had comparable at similar places in Chinatown.  And the portions were extremely small, even though the price tag was mostly in the upper teens for the dishes.  Half of a crispy skin chicken for $16.00??  $14.50 for a teeny tiny sauteed vegetable dish?  The night was expensive for my poor friend who took 10 of us out for a special occasion.    Even the price would not have bothered me that much had the dishes been prepared with care.  Unfortunately, I cannot say that the quality of the food was any better than your standard Chinatown restaurant.  The stir fries were all overwhelmingly oily.  The stir fried fish dish that we ordered, which is supposed to have crispy fish fins that you can chew and eat were fried \"soft\".  Nothing special about the eggplant and the veggies were flavoured with some sort of soya based sauce (a no-no).  The best dish of the dinner was the fried e-fu noodles.  One good dish among 10 does not a 5-star restaurant make.  And finally, the service.  We were blessed with one of the worst Chinese waiters I have ever encountered.  Maybe my standards are high, but generally at a Chinese restaurant, you can be expected to have a conversation with the waiter about portion size, etc.  The most helpful waiters give you their opinion and suggestions.  This one just stood there like a log while the 10 of us obviously struggled to order off of the completely non-creative and expensive menu.  At the end of ordering the dishes, he told us the dishes would be small but unlike most other waiters did not highly encourage us to upgrade the dishes to the larger portion (for an extra price of course).  The outcome?  Super small dishes shared among 10 people.  If I was at Pearl with my parents, they probably would have been so embarrassed they would have never gone back.  Fortunately, we were all 20-30 somethings who didn't much care.  The upshot?  If you can afford it, save your money and go elsewhere.  This is a place I will only go back to for the view."}
{"text":"Very Expensive for what I consider to be mediocre Chinese food. It was edible but nothing fancy. Though price would have you believe otherwise. Presentation is ok in restaurant, though I ordered to go."}
{"text":"Terrific food and fast service. Good was served hot each dish each time. We had the fried grouper in chili and bean sauce--yum!  We also had the seafood noodles which were wonderful."}
{"text":"There aren't many places downtown these days where I'd bother with dim sum. Pearl Habroufront is among the three I would even contemplate. With a great view and solid to good dim sum, this is always in the rotation for those days that we just can't make it up North.  There are all the usual suspects like har gow, siu mai, and cheung fun - and they're all done fairly well. There are also carts, which are becoming more rare, so it's a plus for some people.  Prices are above average, but the surroundings and location account for that.  Parking is a little silly right now. The lot next door is making way for underground parking and a new space, so it's the lot across the street you're gunning for. Don't forget to bring your ticket with you to get $5 off at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunate name and slightly expensive, but the best dim sum I have had downtown."}
{"text":"I come here really often since it's just 3 minutes from where I live.  Good for people with family.   Food is average, service is OK, the view is great. A lot of tourists in the summer and could get crowded. Like the dim sum durin lunch hours.  Good place to go when we have no where else to go."}
{"text":"With an interior combining a clean, attractive mix of whites, light browns, and light wood, Pearl gives off the aura of being a casually upscale restaurant. The view out the window is of Centre Island, which must be beautiful during the day in the Spring and Summer when there's green on the trees. However, I'd imagine that there's not much of a view at night or during the winter as there are no buildings and seemingly nothing to light up the island.  The service is attentive and the food pretty good, the menu featuring dishes I hadn't tried before--namely curry cuttlefish. However, that said, the prices at this restaurant are absolutely absurd,  I have never seen prices like on this menu: almost $3 for a glass of soda, $9 for an appetizer of calamari, and $17 for ginger chicken. There are a few lunch specials starting at $12. While I enjoyed my lunch, the prices alone are enough to discourage me from returning."}
{"text":"My foodie book club's first book was on Chinese food in American (The Fortune Cookie Chronicles) and we met at Pearl Harbourfront to discuss.  The location is hard to find, but has beautiful views of Lake Ontario. The restaurant is *huge* and was empty, but we met on a Monday.   The service was excellent -- I can't say enough about the lovely and humourous staff!  The food was meh at best. It was pretty standard Chinese fare. It was very salty and I could barely make a fist when I woke up the next morning from the sheer salt content. The lettuce wraps were great, as was the Hot and Sour soup. The shrimp and chicken dishes weren't great, but the mango pudding was delish! And, since no Chinese meal is complete without a fortune cookie (like in our book!), we all got fortune cookies that were in *both* english and french!!  Bottom line: the food won't knock your socks off, but the view and the staff will."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food!! The service was a little slow (we were unfortunately in a hurry) but the food great. Good for sharing. And a wonderful view of the water."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but my most recent experience will probably be my last. At the door they have a sign for a 'Winter dinner special'. This drew us in for one of their appetizers posted as a special  for $5. We ask our server what it was and after he explains the dish, we order it.  Food is not bad here but in all honesty,  it is way overpriced.  We ordered 2 dishes and an appetizer.  You can go over to China town and get more bang for the buck.  Our soup came without a ladle and one of our soup bowls was clearly not washed bc there were pieces of rice in it.  When our bill came, the appetizer special was listed as $10. We complained to the server and he said that this was the lunch special.  So why didnt he tell us before when we asked him to explain the dish?   We acknowledged and paid our bill. When we got to the door,  the special on the board CLEARLY stated,  'WINTER DINNER SPECIAL'. We complained to the receptionist and she said that this does not apply and that she forgot to take the sign out from the door. We tried asking for a refund bc  it was clearly their mistake and she just ignored us.   In all honesty,  if you want really good Chinese food, go to China town. So much selection over there for half the price. You are only paying for the view here, not the food. Gave this place 1 star bc I'm a nice guy:)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful view, convenient location--this place is great.  The atmosphere is a bit more refined than I'm used to for dim sum, though--I feel nervous about slopping my food everywhere when I'm dining with cloth napkins and tablecloths!  It's also pricier than the dim sum places I'm used to eating at.  The wait for a table is a bit much, especially given that we had a reservation.  All that aside, I very much enjoyed the meal and though I'll never suggest this place as my first choice, I'll gladly eat here if someone else wants to."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place out after hearing good things about it. So I go there with my mom for lunch. We made reservations for noon. I requested a window seat and they told me they would see what they could do.  We get there and were seated promptly. The waiter comes around asking what kind of tea we wanted although he was holding jasmine tea in his hands. I asked about the type of tea with flowered tea leaves and he tells me it's chrysanthemum tea. So I say that's what I want. He seemed very annoyed and walks away. Strike 1.  So we are seated by a window seat but some time goes by and only two dim sum carts come by. I ask the waiter if we can order dishes. He rudely asks what I would like so I replied equally rudely that I will need to see the dim sum menu. Strike 2.  So I ordered the regular dim sum fare - ha gao, xiu mai, chicken feet and beef tripe. All of this tasted mediocre. Luckily we ordered shrimp and veggie dumplings, deep fried shrimp paste in eggplant and scallop deep fried in Taro which were excellent. The only thing I regret not ordering was the deep fried seafood balls (which I had to inquire about from another waiter since our waiter was all attitude, nowhere to be found and not helpful at all).  The service overall was decent, if you do not factor in our waiter. The view was spectacular - we had an amazing lake view. The table setting was top notch fine dining style. The damage was $53 with tax and tip.   I definitely recommend trying this place out for the eggplant and deep fried shrimp dish, the deep fried seafood balls, and the scallop deep fried with taro. Also for the amazing view. But I'm giving them a 3 star because their regular dim sum fare tastes mediocre, the service was below par, and the price is kind of high given that 70% of the food is mediocre.   Another thing I just realized is that to top things off, we never got the menu so we had no idea what each dish cost other than the fact they were small, medium, large or special. How's that for keeping someone in suspense?! Striiiiiiiike 3, yoooou're out!  Parking is pay parking by the half hour ($3.50 or $4) or flat $10 if you can walk from the third parkade further west. We found free parking by the tip top loft condos but it's quite a walk."}
{"text":"Definately pricey but great Dim Sum and a beautiful view of the harbourfront from this second floor establishment in Queen's Quay. Got to get there early as its a really busy place. I always get a table overlooking the waterfront if I turn up right when it opens. About 45 minutes into opening and they will start rolling carts around the restaurant and you choose what you want to eat. Service is excellent and attentative. Recommended"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!  I usually like trying new places, and today I've got a dim sum craving. Carefully did my research online, and read all the review. Pearl came up as expensive out of china town restaurant. I visited their website and checked the menu. Everything looked good. Dim sums: Vegetable, Peanuts, Bean Curd, Spinach at $4-6 per portion.  I spent 30 minutes waiting for the table, which was actually a good sign for me. Then I consulted the server about \"vegetable\" dim sum since I don't eat mushrooms. He said that mushrooms are there. I asked about other vegetarian option and ordered Spinach ($5.8 for 4 pcs) and Peanut dim sum. It wasn't enough food for me, so I asked to bring me Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf ($6,5).  You know, when you are vegetarian most of your life, you can feel things in your food. When I opened so called \"lotus leaf\", I noticed a substance which triggered the bell. I asked my friend to try it. He said probably it's a chicken.  When I opened my first dim sum, the spinach one, I saw leafs mixed with something white-red, the shrimp. The peanut dim sum was with pork.   The server told us it is very good, but I sent everything back to the kitchen. At the exit I tried to talk to the manager, but the hostess told me he is busy.   My friend who happened to try my things and couple other dishes got sick with diarrhea attack in 20 minutes after we left the restaurant. Not a good sign either.  Honestly, i have never seen such a misleading menu in my life and I will never get back to the place. The only good thing about the restaurant is the view, but it is much nicer from the outside!"}
{"text":"This is the most rudest, racist Chinese restaurant in North America. Food is mediocre, and the service is HORRIBLE!! The so-called owner but also waitering there was the most rudest person on earth. We hope that the anti-racism society would give them a lawsuit. We recommend that no one should come to this mediocre but pricey Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and overhyped. We only tried this dim sum spot because of a recommendation. Yo're better off going to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the place is clean with a pleasant setting. If you can get a window seat, the view of the lake is spectacular on a sunny day. The food is a bit more expensive than other dim sum places, but well worth it for the view.   The service is quick and efficient, but sometimes you can feel rushed, especially on Sundays when there is a crowd waiting outside. I've been there several times now, and would recommend this place to anyone looking for good dim sum with a good view."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant I would recommend to people. Not only they have a beautiful unobstructed view of the lake, the food is pretty good too.   I've visited them multiple times for dim sum and dinner. Dim sum in general is good, shrimp is fresh, which is hard to come by in Chinese restaurants. The one thing I loooooove is the fried black sesame balls. They are round dough filled with black sesame paste, then covered in sesame seed on the outside and deep fried. When you bite into it, it's super crunchy on the outside, and the gooey black sesame paste oozes out (to burn your tongue). It is the Chinese equivalent of an awesome molten chocolate cake!!  For dinner, I don't really know where to begin, because everything is pretty good. I usually ask them to recommend what's good, and so far it hasn't really gone wrong."}
{"text":"This is one dim sum restaurant that I would bring my boss to.  The food is better than average and fresh.  My favorite was their seafood fritters and almond dessert.  Service was prompt.  The view of the lake was spectacular."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying dim sum at Pearl since I was a kid, it's remained an amazing destination both for the views and the food. It's a little pricey but in my opinion worth it. It's one of those places that you can actually enjoy the afternoon. I recommend the hand rolled rice noodles that come around under a glass bowl, they are delicious. Enjoy the food and the view. I've always had great service there and the food is high quality. It's best in the summer or the dead of winter. Looking out at the lake while enjoying dim sum is worth the cost of food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We had reservations however, the restaurant was not full so walk-ins would probably be okay.  The lake views from the restaurant are gorgeous.  The service is quite good and the food came out quickly.  We were there before noon so we ordered our dim sum from the menu, which I usually prefer b/c all the food is hot and fresh when it arrives, vs when it's been pushed around the entire restaurant before getting to your table.  We ordered quite a lot of dishes for 6 people and the bill was about $150.00 plus tip. In my opinion that is hefty for dim sum but given the quality and the location, I would come back for a birthday lunch or some other special occasion.  I guess I'm used to the prices in Richmond Hill/Markham for equally good dim sum.  My favourite dishes were the scallop rice noodle roll (which I've seen in HK but not in Toronto) and the bbq pork pastry. Everything else was really good too.    I have to say that for a Chinese restaurant, the service was good.  We received a discount on our bill because there was a problem with our food. Usually at Chinese restaurants when this happens, you wouldn't even get an apology let alone a discount.  It was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"Exquisite food that is well worth the price  Service was spot on !   Nothing to banter, it was lovely. Also to mention that I apparently came on their first day back from renovation. How lucky"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch dim sum a couple of times. taste was alright. IMO It's hard to screw up dim sum. friendly service. I try to go a bit earlier or later to get sits next to the window. As others have mentioned, it's a very nice view =) comes out to less than $15 per person for lunch"}
{"text":"As the view of a Chinese, they offered good taste food and reasonable price with amazing lake view!!! First time using yelp to find rest nearby and yelp did not let me down :-)"}
{"text":"Experienced a great dimsum experience at Pearl harbourfront chinese restaurant. If you forget to make a reservation (which is a good idea because the restaurant fills up fast on weekends) your best bet is to arrive around 11am to snatch up a window side table for the great view of the waters. By 12 pm the restaurant is filled with hungry diners and the dimsum carts start filing out quickly. The dimsum was well done, and the highlight was def the egg tarts. The staff couldve been a little bit more attentive and friendly but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"So this us what real Chinese food taste like! Loved the dim sums. The price wasn't bad. And quickly got surprisingly full  :)"}
{"text":"Great food but some bad experiences with body hair in food  Some pros: - Great dumplings and food in general. I'd say it would rank one of the top place in Toronto for this kind of food - Great view, right by the lake - Fast service-ish  Some nasteh cons: - Second time it happened ... first time found some body hair in the food when they brought it to the table. I let it slide cause they brought a new one right away. Happened again today and was so nasty. At least they offered the option to cancel or reorder, and gave us 10% after ... - Pretty high price you can find equal value for cheaper if you look aroudn - Pubes  Would never go again. Fire that damn hairy chef you got back there and we'll come back"}
{"text":"If you like your dim sum and can tell the difference between quality and everyday quality then this is the place for you. The place is pricey but in my view well worth it. Nice view of the waterfront from most seats. The place also has some unique dishes that I have not seen at other places. The service is also quite good and there is a steady flow"}
{"text":"Dim sum by the Habourfront. It is more expensive than your dim sum in Chinatown but you are really here for the view and less crowded. The dim sum was good, comparable to the other good dim sum places in Markham / Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I seldom have dinner downtown in a Chinese restaurant.  Usually I will come here at lunch for its dim sums.  At night, even at the window seat, there is not much view out there as it is so dark.  I order a walnut beef and a vege dish.  Both the quality are marginal average.  I can see its style of cooking is still back at the eighties.  May be it retains the feel of the old Toronto city.  Now with so many good quality Chinese restaurants in the north, comparatively it needs to catch up.   There is not too many people in the restaurants during the weekday night.  The waiter is a bit hard to find him.  I would recommend this place for its view and dim sums but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Dim Sum but Pearl is very good. Other dishes are hit or miss depending on your expectations. It's good quality food but a little pricey compared to other Chinese fare in town."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that this place is located in a mall fool you. Once you walk through and enter it, the decor is beautiful, and you are presented with a great panoramic view of the lake that is visible from nearly everywhere in the restaurant.   It's very expensive but the food is wonderful. I went there with a large group (about 10 people), and so we got one of the combination platters (I think it was the \"Pearl\"). It wound up being about $500 for the platter, so about $50/each plus drinks, but it was an eight course meal! Instead of bringing it all out at once, which is what I'm used to from Chinese group dining, they brought out each dish one by one and simply served you a small portion of it. We had stir fried scallops, fried and stuffed crab claw, \"double happy\" shark fin soup, braised lobster, peking duck, hot and sour soup, crispy chicken, the works. It was amazing. Every dish that came out was solidly impressive.   The only reason I am reluctant to give 5 stars is the price. Everything else was awesome."}
{"text":"We went at an off-peak time and had an amazing view of the harbour. Service was quick. Food was consistently good. We had Dim Sum. I recommend it and would go back."}
{"text":"I made reservations for lunch here with my family.  I have to say the table they gave us was really nice, by the window overlooking the lake.  The waiter I found was rushing us to order our food and they served our appetizers and main dishes all together which I did not like.  The sweet and sour soup was cold and the beef dish was chewy, even the Kung pao chicken dish was cold and had very small pieces of chicken.  We have eaten at the pink pearl in Bayview village location and I find the dishes are prepared much better there."}
{"text":"We celebrated our daughter's 16th birthday here. Everyone in our grand family of 60 people loved the food and the service. Three servers were dedicated to our party. They were professional and very helpful. They made sure to attend to all the needs for every guest. Every dish in the banquet menu was delicious and well presented. Kim, the manager was very helpful in assisting us from selecting the foods to accommodating our vegetarian guests. I highly recommend this venue for your next special event. Thank you Kim and all the staff at the Pearl."}
{"text":"Pearl est un excellent restaurant de cuisine cantonaise haut-de-gamme avec une vue imprenable sur le lac Ontario. J'y suis allé au moins huit ou neuf fois en dix ans et la qualité a toujours été de mise.   Je recommande bien entendu le Crystal Fold, un mets où du porc haché est servi dans une belle feuille de laitue craquante : le contraste chaud/froid est parfaitement réussi."}
{"text":"My personal favorite Chinese restaurant in the downtown area. The foods are fresh, esp seafoods are delicious. Dimsum are very well done too. Prompt service. Excellent lake view can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The location is great!  We got a table with the lake view.  Best way to enjoy dim sum.  The Shrimp dumpling (Ha gao) - is very nicely done.  Shrimp is big and tasty. The Pork bun (cha shu bao) - nice  Ribs, rice noodles roll .. etc.. all the others just average.  Overall experience is great.."}
{"text":"We order our office luncheon from this place.  They have good dim sum and delivery is on time.  We also have the office yearly Chinese New Year dinner here.  It was dark so there was not much to see in terms of the lake front.  We come here for the ambience but the place is way over price."}
{"text":"Environment very nice, wait service sub-par, food quality pretty good, prices decent.  I came to the location with a reservation and a group deal. It was half empty when m'lady and I arrived and we were seated within a minute. The first waitress asked us if we were there for the dimsum. We had no idea what was available, so we said we weren't and she responded that she'd be right back with a regular menu. The regular menu consisted of 3 set lunch meals which could each be customized a little bit (meaning there were options within each set meal). We realized that the prices were too low for us to cover our group deal, so we asked about the dimsum. The waiter that we got came with a menu that only had a few words worth of descriptions for each item and no prices. It almost looked like some of those all you can eat sushi place menus. I asked him when he passed by our table next what the prices were and he took the menu with him and came back with the price of each size (Small, Medium, and Large). Eventually we found out that there was a different price for the SPecial size (I'm capitalizing the respective letters as each box contained one of two letters to signify what size the meal in question was respectively). It seemed like this place catered to people who didn't care how much they were paying for their meals (with the exception of their small lunch menu).  There were at least 4 members of the wait staff in the area, so them being overstaffed would be an understatement. Yet we sat with empty plates on our table for extended periods of time until I asked one of the waiters to prepare the rest of m'lady's meal \"to-go.\" Eventually after he took her plate away to box it, the empty plates were collected.  The quality of the food was pretty good, although I burned my mouth one one of the pieces of dimsum as it was that hot. Also, we were presented with our dessert at the same time as the rest of our meal, so it sat at the table for extended periods until we were ready for it.  So all-in-all, price-wise and environment-wise (when it comes to the view at least) I couldn't complain about this restaurant. However, considering the service and lack of pricing of their items on their menus, I'd really think twice about returning to Pearl Harbourfront."}
{"text":"Took the old family to the Pearl Harbourfront for some Dim Sum.  Today (Monday) would have been perfect if it had not been for the weather (gray and cloudy). The restaurant was very open and clean and has the extra benefit of being on the  water.  The smoked vegetable role was excellent -- note that this is on the SP (special) part of the menu. My dad liked the vegetable dishes and especially the fried taro. I liked the curry cuttle fish, which was perfectly seasoned.  There were a couple of casualties however, the beef tip actually turned out to be tripe. I really don't like tripe but the flavor wasn't horrible. The selection was less bountiful than many of the large dim sum restaurants in Monterey Park. Nevertheless, in the end we found enough to eat to become very full. If you have time during a weekday I I would recommend this to restaurant to those dim sum lovers who have a family.   I should also note the prices were quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Generally people will say that if you are looking for ethnic food, go where people of that ethnicity are eating.  From that standpoint the Pearl Harbourfront Chinese Cuisine must have been good.  Dumplings were excellent as was the fried beef short ribs with honey black pepper sauce.  On the other hand the service was terrible.  Granted they were busy but we felt totally ignored.  The atmosphere completely ruined what could have been a good dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for a CNY work event. Our department had over 120 people and had a preset menu. We pretty much took up the whole restaurant.  Firstly, the location is unsuspecting but maintains a gorgeous view of the lake. It's in the plaza next to the harbour front ticket booth on the second floor beside the food court. Excellent view, I can during winter and it was still beautiful.   Because we had ordered before hand we had a set menu that consisted of these items: hockey puck dumpling, siu Mai, shrimp rice rolls, fried spring roll, fried potsticker, fried shrimp in wonton, sesame ball, mango pudding, curry rice noodles, beef rice noodles, chicken fried rice and chicken pie. Of these items, I found the quality great. Being a chinese restaurant, the salt content was right up to par. Everything was flavourful. All of these items were $24.00. There was a lot of food but the menu chosen lacked variety as it was chosen to benefit the westerners in our group and to ensure the price wasn't too muh as normally dim sum dishes start at $4.00 for a small to $8.50 for special items.   The service was great. We got there at 12:00pm and we're all promptly served and able to get out of there by 1:15p.   I will definitely be coming here again in the summer to enjoy the view and also check out the rest of the menu with my family!"}
{"text":"I used to love Pearl Harbourfront. Whenever we traveled to Toronto, we dined there. I returned in 2007 during my spring break and dined with my friends at Pearl Harbourfront and was extremely disappointed. To make matters worse, our waiter was picking his nose."}
{"text":"Classic dim sum place, with a pretty view.  My partner and I had Saturday brunch here on a sunny day. Though knowing the price was on the higer side, I had bought a groupon ($15 for $30) earlier this year and wanted to use it. We were seated at a window table which had a nice view of Lake Ontario - I would suggest making reservations for window tables those were the ones that filled up quickly when we were there.  We ordered a good selection from the dim sum menu, including the shrimp dumplings, deep fried squid, stuffed taro. The food wasn't especially tasty but I would recommend  Hockey Pucks, which is unique to this restaurant.  The service was average at best - the server didn't ask if we wanted to order drinks, and I had to politely ask for a menu after being seated a while. They had items on push-carts but they were either cold items covered with plastic or items that we didn't like very much. However, after filling out the order on paper with the menu they gave us, our food was brought over rather quickly. Our bill came up to around $70 after tax, before gratuities.   I give this place 4 stars - worth a visit to see the view if you happen to be downtown, but I wouldn't likely return for a second visit."}
{"text":"Call and make a reservation before arriving to make sure you get a window seat!  Beautiful view of Ontario Lake, and authentic Dim Sum!!"}
{"text":"When I moved back into the downtown core from Scarborough I realized how scarce the Dim Sum scene has become.  Once memorable Chinatown staples have become run down and dingy in comparison to the offerings Markham and Richmond Hill have to offer with their sprawling Chinese community.  Amongst the upper end of Dim Sum spots, and there are quite a few downtown, Pearl provides a unique and authentic experience that many higher end places lack.  They still push carts around with food, you can also order on a paper card too.  The servers dress in regular Chinese restaurant attire and the food stays to it's true Cantonese roots.  There are a small handful of dishes you may find unique though.    The food itself, clean, not oily, seasoned well, not too salty, made like how I remember Dim Sum should be before adding affluent ingredients became a thing.  You pay for the view, the dining space itself is understated for a Chinese restaurant, it is however clean and bright and has a much slower pace than many of its bustling cousins.    The food is good, for the premium price some people may not justify but for me I like the ambiance, the pace, the view and the good, authentic, simple (for what dim sum has now become) food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite dim sum place in Toronto. The food is delicious and the view of the lake is gorgeous. I always take visiting family and friends for dim sum and everyone always enjoys the trip! However, I've taken one star off because of how pricey it is. Overall prices are high and I don't like how they charge for hot tea and is based on the number of people you have. They also charge for refills on tea which doesn't make much sense to me, considering they just add hot water to the pot. Alas, I guess this is what you must pay for dining in the city. Otherwise, great food and the hockey puck dumplings are a must to try!"}
{"text":"Value 1/5; service 4/5; location 5/5 food quality 2/5; cleanliness 2/5. Great location. Good and fast service. Good dim sum everything else I've tried is mediocre and under (used to be good).  Food is overpriced. Toronto has better experiences to offer for a better price."}
{"text":"I was expecting a huge line up like at dim sum restaurants located in Chinatown. Surprisingly, we got a table immediately since the restaurant opened later than its peers. There is no doubt that no other dim sum restaurant has a better view of the lake. With that said, each item was quite expensive relative to its peers. For example - Har Gow (crystal shrimp dumplings) was close to $6.   We ordered the standard selection of dim sum items consisting of dumplings, sticky rice, deep fried squid and char siu buns. I found all the dishes comparable to the better dim sum places around the city. One item that really stood out for me was the deep fried squid. It had just the right amount of batter and the squid was very soft and chewable. I've had extremely chewy squid at other restaurants and it is not pleasant.  The all-in bill was close to $60 for 2 people. Yes, it is on the pricier end for dim sum, but wouldn't expect to be cheaper given its location."}
{"text":"Overrated and much hyped for your average Chinese restaurant. Yes it maybe authentic, considering that the waiters barely know any English, the food is the same as any other cheaper Chinese place. Interior is good, but the true gem is the view. Looking out to the sea, its is great place for a romantic lunch date. Try not to go here for dinner as you cant see the lake in the pitch dark. All in all, an average restaurant and worth a checkout if your in a mood for Chinese."}
{"text":"I attended a dinner here for a friend last night and being my second time here I was not wow'd in a way that would make me travel from the suburbs just to go to this place. That being said if people were going here I wouldn't turn my nose up at it....I just know the burbs does it better when it comes to quality Chinese food.   The cost of dinner was covered last night so while I cannot comment on their prices last night I know that on a previous lunch date here I was wow'd....by how ludicrous their prices were. If memory serves me correctly an appetizer and 2 main courses (with water to drink) came at a lunch time price tag of over $50. No way Jose!  I will say that the food was good quality and cooked well. My friend had organized a french service style dinner where platters were brought around and items were plated for us. Hard to keep track what's hitting your plate with each wave of food but a couple items that stood out were the hot and sour soup (I usually don't like this dish but it was thick and flavorful) as well as the gigantic Gyoza we each received as an appetizer.  Things I wasn't crazy about, the service was a little short and at one point during the dinner service we all commented that we felt the server was almost yelling at us what things were....a tad rude. The only other thing was the Peking duck tacos or whatever they were, they really skimped on the \"duck\" several of us literally got well cooked tasty skin. is that common? I have no basis for comparison, if that's what Peking duck is thennnn it was great, if there was supposed to be some meat attached to that skin thennnnnn I would say negative 1 cool point.  As I said earlier, I don't know that I shall return here on my own steam, but if someone organizes something or its a spot for a meeting then I could see myself dining here."}
{"text":"You hear very often that this is not the tourist trap that it looks like, but it really is. It's popular with the locals but that's because the closest dim sum after this is all the way in Spadina where the quality goes way down. The food quality is fine and the views from the window tables are nice, and thus the dim sum is pricey as mentioned in other reviews. The gimmicky carts go around very slowly with the same stuff so it takes a while for the diversity of food to really show. That said, the waiter gave us a dim sum menu so we could check off our selections and the kitchen would make the items for us on demand. The menu was pretty small but at least the staples (cha siu bao, har gow, cheung fun) were well represented. One particularly unique item was the shark fin soup dumpling which was quite good. Overall, though, the place is mediocre and can't hold a candle to any of the fine establishments North of Steeles.  One warning about parking - you can get validated parking at the lot ACROSS the street from the mall. Parking in the adjacent lot is not validatable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the foot of Bay St. on Queens Quay West with an unobstructed waterfront view making it a pleasant environment for diners. I came on a weekday a few months back for dim sum when it's less hectic than weekends.  I was hoping for a window seat but apparently they were all reserved for some unknown guests who have yet to arrive. The dim sum was alright, nothing bad to say about it. The price on the other hand is 3 times what you would normally be charged. I don't mind paying for more but only IF they can justify it with a phenomenal product. The dim sum was far from spectacular!   It's apparent this restaurant is charging its patrons for the waterfront view and NOT providing an elevated product or service.  Don't be fooled, the dim sum is no better than what you would get in Chinatown.  I left feeling duped with no value added and a much lighter wallet."}
{"text":"This place definitely ranks as one of the top restaurants for dim sum in the city! I was just there this past weekend and am always content about the service and great food. The dumplings are so fresh and the hockeypucks are a classic and delicious menu item!  The only reason I can't give this restaurant a 5/5 is because it is a higher-end place and the prices are higher-end prices. But honestly, for the quality of the dim sum, it's worth it to splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"not going to say much except that chinese people eat here (including myself when i used to work on the waterfront).   that is a good indicator that it's decent to pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday. We had a reservation but there was still a 20 minute wait. I never knew this place was so popular. The view from the restaurant is fantastic. The decor is nice and the service prompt. It's like an efficient factory with everyone hurrying everywhere. The plates were cleared immediately and more food was served almost immediately.   The carts came by with all kinds of food. I was a bit disappointed as while we were there, it seemed like the food never made it past the first few tables. We had to actually ask for a menu and place a few orders. The food tasted great and quality was good. I don't believe it was that expensive. It was about $25 per person and I did not hold back on the food! I am no dim sum efficianado but I loved the food.   Next time I am going to try and get there at the start of the lunch rush and see if I get some food off the carts without placing an order."}
{"text":"Every downtowner knows that one of the best places to get your dimsum fix is at the Harbourfront because you can't beat the view.  Last weekend I went...the food is a bit pricier, and not always amazing, but you get the harbour every time, beautiful in every season.   Pearl Harbourfront doesn't serve up their food with stellar service, but they do take reservations.  They also do their best to get you what you want if the dishes you're craving don't pass by on the cart.  Prices are reasonable, about $100 for four people - not bad for dimsum.  The staples - ha gow and sui mai - were hot out of the kitchen and tasty:  Don't worry, I didn't forget vegetables (although I admit, they're usually an afterthought)."}
{"text":"This place surprisingly ranks the top places for dim sum. Added bonus of having a great view. Great place to take guests from out of town"}
{"text":"Great chinese food with a fantastic view. Call ahead and ask if you can be seated along the windows. The place is located inside a building/mall so don't get discouraged if you can't see it from the parking lot. The food is above average chinese and the ambiance is definitely upscale. This is perfect for family gatherings and date night as well as business meetings/dinners. The view is just fantastic, great sunset watching too."}
{"text":"Would recommend the dimsum as they have a large selection of dishes and high quality service. The other dine-in menu really isn't worth the big bucks - there's nothing special except the lakeside view."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese Dim Sum place I've been to. Very clean and modern, most Chinese restaurants are cheap and classic. The food was presented and prepared well. We had a table next to the window with a prefect view of Lake Ontario.  And they replaced our plates as we ate and the service was amazing and quick.  I don't think Dim Sum gets any better than this."}
{"text":"We came across this restaurant by chance.  The food and service was fantastic.  It was a littler later for dinner than we wanted and the place was still busy.  The server was very friendly.  The food selection was fantastic.  it is a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Want delicious dim sum and a waterfront view? This is your place. Oh, I love dim sum, and this place did not disappoint. It has all the dishes you can think of. The service was prompt too. They have cart service, but we came close to closing. They still served us, but the carts were no longer there. I'd come again!"}
{"text":"I regularly order their food for delivery!  I love the consistency of the taste.  The Honey Black Pepper ribs are delicious!  The prices are slightly pricey however you get what you pay for.  There delivery is always amazingly fast as well.    I have been to eat in the restaurant and with the lake views and friendly service it was also a pleasure to dine in."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much out of this place since it's in a touristy area, but I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered off the dim sum menu, and everything tasted fresh. My favorites were all the dumplings and the fried radish cake. The best part of course was the view of the harbourfront!"}
{"text":"One of the Schwankayer dim sum restaurants i've been to. White table cloths replacing white plastic garbage bag coverings that also serve to scoop up the leftovers in one foul swoop.   Delicious, delicate shrimp rice rolls. One of my favorites. I also always judge a dim sum restaurant by the black bean spare ribs. Really terrific.  Not greasy, great selection, staff that you dont have to say \" Excuse me... ah ah excuse me\" only to have them pass you by reducing you to feel like a horrible gwai lo for choosing to eat there.  The staff are friendly and helpful  Go to here"}
{"text":"The Dim Sum was the best ever. Great food and what a view!  Very, very clean. More expensive , but worth it. We had 7 Dim Sum items and the bill was $45.00,"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience and great food! I've had great dim sum in NY and Hong Kong, and I have to say my experience at Pearl did not disappoint.   My friends and I actually were recommended this place by the  concierge at the Renaissance so we were a little concerned it would be too touristy, but the food was actually quite authentic. We did only order the common small plates (shrimp dumplings, siu mai, pork buns, roast pork rolls, egg tarts, and some others). The flavors were clean and everything tasted fresh. the shrimp dumplings really stood out for us as each dumpling actually had a good amount of shrimp, and it tasted fresh.   They even had fried taro dumplings, something seemingly becoming more and more uncommon.   A little pricier than your typical dim sum place, but you are paying for the ambiance and the service. This place is very classy in comparison to the usual dim sum places, (perhaps catering to the non-Chinese populations?) If you've had dim sum in Chinatown, you know what I'm talking about, it's usually much more casual. Not to say this place had a stuffy feel. Also, I was pleased to find that all the waiters and employees we encountered spoke English. I speak Cantonese, so this isn't usually an issue for me, but good news for people worried about a language barrier as is common at dim sum places (or maybe this is just how it is in NY?)"}
{"text":"The good: Beautiful views. The steamed rice. The vegetable dumplings. The soya sauce.  The bad: all of the other dishes we ordered were average at best or awful.  We ordered the beef and broccoli fried noodles, fried spicy tofu, vegetable rolls (the worst thing I've eaten in a while).  Staff wasn't friendly. The place has a tired look given how expensive it was.  The bill came out to $75++!! Everything was about twice as much as you would pay in Chinatown. And even if we paid Chinatown prices, we wouldn't come back.  Some reviewers were shocked with the low reviews. I'm shocked with all the high reviews.  It didn't help that as my wife was taking my son to the bathroom, she saw a staff member using the urinal because he didn't close the door.  A pity, given its amazing location."}
{"text":"Good traditional food.  Expensive and they nickel and dime (tea was $3.50 - we didn't want it, they pushed it on us).  My fav dish was the snow pea leaves, but $19 is too much for a vegetable side dish. The view is stunning if you can get the good seats overlooking the water.   We were served by Grumpy McSourface.  Food was served quickly."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a last minute Christmas dinner. I had been here several times a few years ago and always loved their Peking duck.   For 5 of us we ordered the Peking duck with crystal fold, hot and sour soup, beef with ginger and mushrooms, snow pea shoots with garlic and country style fried rice. Everything was delicious and the quality of all the ingredients were fresh.   The Peking duck comes with these fluffy bread-like wraps. They're not like your usual crepe style of wrap, but I loved it. It's sweet and gives more substance to the wraps. The only disappointment was that they gave you a lot less duck than they used to and the prices are significantly higher. They pre-separate your crystal fold wraps for you and we only got one each. I prefer to load up my own lettuce and I felt like I was getting less this way as well.   The rest of the dishes were delicious, but nothing I would go out of my way for.   This restaurant is great for the view and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Stunning view of the harbourfront and good service however, the food was not outstanding and had limited options, definitly a more westernized Dim Sum. Love the view, but I can't say I'll come back."}
{"text":"as far as dim sum places go, this one is good.  the view of the harbourfront is amazing. it's serene and it's beautiful  the food was good but nothing was spectacular. their offerings are pretty standard as far as dim sum is concerned. it's solid at best and quite pricey. parking is a hassle, there is a wait, and the service is typical of any dim sum place.  i would go back if i were in toronto again, but more for the view than the food."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Dim Sum places in Toronto, particularly at lunchtime. It has spectacular views over the lake, which alone make a visit worthwhile. Service is swift, maybe slightly impersonal. All the items on the menu are excellently prepared and come fresh and hot. Particularly recommended - the stuffed aubergine, the shrimp dumplings, the deep fried squid, the wonton soup - not on the tick box menu, and snow peas in a garlic, but it is all good. It is slightly more expensive than your average place in Chinatown but is certainly a step up in terms of quality."}
{"text":"We've been patrons of the Pearl for over 35 years( they originally started on Dundas St and Bay in the 80's before migrating to Queens Quay)  I have to say they still get 5 stars from us as its still our favorite Dim Sum place in the GTA.  We went for dinner New Years and had another enjoyable meal.  Can't beat the view,  service and spacious ambience.  Although the prices have risen markedly over the last 10 years; everyone in our party felt it was still worth it.   The restaurant will be closing for 2  weeks to undergo a renovation in 2016 so can't wait to see how it turns out.  I actually prefer the Pearl to the other high end Chinese restaurants in the GTA. ( Lai Wah Heen,  Dynasty,  Casa Imperial... etc). It's our go to Chinese  for visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey, but it's great for dimsum with the coworkers. It's in a very central location - just a short walk from the financial district. Or if you work nearby, lucky you! They serve up some pretty good food, but the views make the restaurant worth while. If you sit on the lower floor, you'll be right next to the windows and have a great view of th"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for dim sum. Service was pretty good considering that the restaurant was very busy (recent Groupon could have been the culprit for that). Food was very good - up to par with the better dim sum restaurants in Scarborough/Markham."}
{"text":"It's our favorite Dimsum place in toronto.   It's fresh, has a lot of selection, the food is super fresh did Iention that the food is super fresh and tasty? It's got to be because this place is always busy at brunch time on the weekends yet you don't have to wait long for a table if you just walk in, we try to make a red but have rolled up hungover on many weekends with no res and got seated within 5 min. That said we try to make reservations.   My recommendations shrimp fried rice (it's super fluffy)  Hockey pucks (shrimp heaven)  Shrimp wanton  Hargao (shrimp dumplings)  Steamed shrimp dumplings Crispy shrimp dumplings Green beans  Extra mustard, hot and soy sauce!   Can you tell that I'm a fan of the shrimps??"}
{"text":"Quite pricey but the restaurant is in a nice location, and is wonderfully decorated. The staff are also friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend the vegetable steamed dumplings. I've never had vegetable dumplings that have the clear wrap (like ha gow but veggie filling). I would have gotten two orders of that if I could. I also liked the smoked veggie roll. I would have passed on the spring rolls and vegetable soup which were too expensive. My partner had the chicken fried rice which he said was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing dim sum! Meat and noodle dishes aren't spectacular and are a tad overpriced. The mango pudding is a must."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and the restaurant was at about half capacity.  When I made the reservation, the hostess promised she'd try her best at getting us a lake-view table, but that wasn't to be as they were all occupied when we arrived.  The dim sum itself was nothing special (perhaps I have been spoiled by some gems in Richmond Hill and Scarborough) and we found the cart service super slow - only at the end of our meal did we figure out that we can simply ask servers walking by to bring us a specific dish.  The pricing was very high for the quality of the food, guessing downtown rent and the view comes with a premium, so overall 2 stars for food and 4 stars for the ambiance (it was an absolutely gorgeous day outside and you can see people paddleboarding on the lake). A great place to take someone who has never tried dim sum before and/or someone new to Toronto, but nothing more."}
{"text":"This was a very nice restaurant with authentic tasting dim sum and sizable options. The view by the window is fantastic, but make sure to make a reservation in advance for the window seats. I would recommend the steamed shrimp dumplings, the pork siu mai, Duck egg-yolk bun. The egg tart was very average and the overall pricing is on the expensive side for dim sum."}
{"text":"Dim sum so yummy!  Definitely on expensive side, but you get the view. Service good enough."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Pearl for quite some time and finally had the opportunity to dine here last week. The anticipation set my expectations high, and Pearl met them. The dim sum is some of the best I have tried in Toronto. Yes, the price tag is slightly higher than most other restaurants, but it is well worth it. I was also pleasantly surprised that they served dim sum at dinner time.   The beef with snow peas and mushrooms was phenomenal. The veggies were fresh and it was a good portion size for the price. The rice noodles were just ok. A little small for the price and the flavour was lacking.  The service was prompt and the food arrived quickly. I also liked that they didn't rush you out and bring the bill right after we finished our food. Overall, I would return for the great service and dim sum."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sat at 1pm. Made reservations for 4 and we were promptly seated. The restaurant was half-full. The dim sum tasted great, and they used push-carts that come by your table. Many dishes had shrimp in it eg steamed, fried, etc. Total for 12 dishes was $97! We used a $30 off groupon. Look out for these groupons, the resto seems to use them frequently. Amazing view of Lake Ontario."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Chinese restaurant in a unique waterfront location. Service is good and the quality of food is excellent. All of the dishes are freshly prepared.   I had the crispy honey chicken with sesame seeds, which was very good and filling. I was told that the stir-fried shrimp with garlic sauce was very tasty and we both enjoyed the fried rice. The food is authentic and not greasy at all. It is relatively expensive as main dishes start at $17.   The restaurant is very large and bright. Make sure you get a seat by the window, so that you can have a view of the lake while you dine."}
{"text":"Beautiful views I can imagine on a sunnier day. Spacious, decent pricing, and the traditional dimsum cart rotations at least gives it some authenticity being that's it's located outside of Chinatown and geared towards tourists. Food and service was satisfying."}
{"text":"Overpriced Chinese food due to its location."}
{"text":"The quality of the dim sum was phenomenal. Probably one of my favourite dim sum places. The view of the water was also beautiful. Service was not bad.  Although, I should mention, I overheard one of the waiters talking to a couple and he mentioned that the restaurant will be closed for renovations starting Feb 2017 to May 2017? Don't quote me on that, but they will be closed for a while for renovations."}
{"text":"Okay so my friends are in love with this place because of the hockey pucks - they are seriously soooo good and perfectly pan-fried! All their dim sum is high quality and delicious. The only downfall is the price - yikes. I get that this is a nice area with beautiful views but since I am used to cheap dim sum in Markham this is a burn to my wallet. Still - I will give them 4 stars for the food and service - they're really quick with refills and are friendly compared to usual dim sum restaurants. Definitely don't expect it to be cheap though."}
{"text":"Amazing food in a restaurant with an amazing view. Classic Dim Sum style, cart-to-table (even of you are down the stairs!), you will have to sit a while to get their full menu. You can order specific items without waiting for them to appear, which was nice.  $100 for 3 people and a 6-year-old to gorge themselves. Great deal."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such a low score on Yelp.   Their shrimp dumpling is the freshest I've ever tasted in North America and probably second only to those in Hong Kong. Service is not great, and they push you to order, but that's what you expect at a dim sum place...  Overall very happy with the variety and quality of their dim sum. It is on the pricier side and the location is a bit hard to find (second floor of a very vacant looking...mall/office building?)"}
{"text":"What's with me today and giving all these 3.5s?   The food was good - we went for dim sum at lunch... but it's pretty standard... nothing to make me go \"OHMYGOSH, I need to go back for chicken feet.\" Ok, chicken feet are awesome, don't hate. Celebrate and try it...   In terms of price, yes, it is pricey. Although if you pay by cash, sometimes they will give you a discount... It's an Asian thing. Like all dim sum places that are \"high end-ish,\" they tried to get you on the tea and believe me, it can be a silent killer... Depending on what you pick, it could be worth 2 dishes of actual food.  Service ain't friendly but again, that's standard for a lot of Chinese cuisine places. It is fast though, but probably trying to get you out!  The view is nice though!  Every now and then, try something new!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for dim sum for special occasions.   Dim sum is comparable to Markham but at a price. But if you care for quality then would skip the dive msg laced downtown Chinatown dim sum restaurants and pay some more $$$ and come here.  My mom loves the atmosphere as its brightly lit, nice view of the lake and quiet (compared to other places).  Side tip: book in advance, request a window view during the air show in August."}
{"text":"Ask for a window seat and relaxing with Beautiful views right in front of the harbor. Diam sun is awesome and well made. There are also $12 lunch menu. Waiter are professionally dressed and took care you well. Will come again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"A Beautiful restaurant with standard Dim sum fare.   Heard about this for some time now, never visited as thought food catered to non-asian and wont be authentic  First thing you notice is the beautiful view of the lake.  The decoration is a major departure from the ones you'd see in Chinatown or markham. It also doesnt have the super crowded and noisy environment one usually get in a yum cha place.  Which means one bonus of much cleaner bathrooms  The service was good.  The staff were happy to accommodate our groups' unique needs.    The food, however, were petty standard. The serving carts came out pretty late so we were already full from the stuff we ordered through the menu. Most of the items can be found in other Chinese restaurant. I was a bit disappointed that there wasnt at least one specialty dish that makes them stand out more (when you have been to many many chinese restaurants, You start to notice that some place have some dishes you don't see elsewhere).   The food does taste authentic, but i think i am just spoiled by all the other places ive been to.  This is a good spot for decent food with good view, especially If you can't be bothered to drive north"}
{"text":"one of the worst Chinese restaurants I had in Toronto...everything sucks...totally not worth the price."}
{"text":"The food was above average Chinese food with lots of interesting and novel options. We got the ginger and pineapple chicken and it came served in half a pineapple which was cute and delicious. I took two stars off for the service though. Every other table around us got shrimp chips with their meal and fortune cookies, however, we had to ask our waiter for those items. This was after waiting for over half an hour after we finished our meal for him to return to the table. Food great, but poor service this time around."}
{"text":"I went to Pearl with a few friends and was happy that they took reservations. I arrived earlier to ensure that we got a window seat. As I waited for my friends, the menu is somewhat diverse with scallop options for dumplings and noodle rolls along with the staple dim sum choices.  When my friends arrived, we quickly ordered the dishes as we were starved. Note that there is no discount as some other dim sum places offer for early bird times. Also, the place gets busy around noon but there is no guarantee for a window seat overlooking the lake if you show up later.  Some of the dishes came quick after ordering and we were surprised but they all were piping hot. This restaurant also has staff pushing carts which was nice to see but it was odd as there were stairs to the window seats which then required the wait staff to assist with the cart going down the 3 steps.  The quality of the food is there and it shows given the price point. At the end of the meal, all of us put in $20 each including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Came here for some lunch time dim sum and good views. Quick service, nice staff and decent dim sum menu. I would have to say the location and views from the restaurant are the drawing factor. It was a beautiful day to dine at Pearl. The views out to the harbor were stunning. The food was hot, and came out in a short amount of time. No complaints with the items we had. Moderately priced as well."}
{"text":"Quality of dimsum is not comparable to places uptown in Richmond hill/ Markham but it has a great location by the harbour, which was the reason my rating increased from a 2 to 3 stars. Make sure to make a reservation to get a seat with a habourfront view or else it will most likely all be filled up by noon.   Service was relatively fast and it was nice how they rolled around carts of dimsum although there wasn't much variety in the carts. One thing that really put me off was that I crunched on quite a bit of sand in one of the pieces of curry cuttlefish dish.. We also got hurried out of the restaurant by the staff after around 2 hour seating."}
{"text":"Wanna lose 5lbs in a few short hours?! Well Pearl Harbourfront is the Chinese Cuisine for you!  After eating there, I had an upset stomach, but that was only the prelude to a viscous ladies room rendezvous. What's super unfortunate about this review is that I checked Yelp before choosing this place.  Sure, the food was good.  We got the General Tao and Shrimp fried rice.  The view was great too. But Jesus, $40 for a 2-course meal? You get twice as much food with twice as much flavor from Ming City. PHCC is twice the price of Ming City so yes, you ARE paying for the view, but what good is a nice view if you're seeing red?!?!  They tricked me! I woulda walked the fudge out if they didn't give us those shrimp chips before we got the menus.  :( My wallet is still hurtin. Prices were like, lemon chicken: 18:50  Lemon chicken with basil 22.50.. Like, come on!! Was the chicken you cooked hatched from a golden egg or something outrageous? This is totally a place for an unsuspecting/ridiculous tourist."}
{"text":"Their food is really good, it's pricey but you are overlooking the harbour, and this isn't Chinatown. They are really accomodating on the phone, even if you had to change a reservation time, they were very nice. We asked for a bowl of hot water (to heat up the baby's food), and when the  waitress saw what the hot water was for, she automatically brought hot water in a bigger bowl, without us having to ask, which was very thoughtful.  The manager is always nice, and there's a nice lounge with new looking classy couches you can lounge at outside, and the manager will come out and call you in for your food. If you're ever at this mall for lunch, I suggest you eat here for dim sum and not go downstairs where the restaurants are pricey and not rated so well."}
{"text":"this place is insanely expensive and very very busy, but the decor is beautiful, as are the views, and the food is fantastic. this is the place to take your wealthy family members who want to \"do brunch\"-- they have great dim sum and the waitstaff is very attentive. i'd venture to say they have the best dumplings in toronto.   that being said, i would never come here alone because of money constraints. an entree costs $20-$40 and a plate of six dumplings is about $10."}
{"text":"Been here many times: lunch, dinner , banquet, and take out. All superb quality and friendly service.   You can't beat the view being right in the water.   Today I had take out from the lunch special menu. I ordered Singapore vermicelli. Not greasy and very flavourful."}
{"text":"Quality Chinese food. Excellent dimsum. Good service. Nice lake view. Pretty good and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Westernized. There is much much much better Chinese to be found elsewhere in Toronto such as: New Sky, Rol San, Lai Wah Heen, Szechuan Legend, Omei, the list goes on and on... so skip Pearl Harbour(front)."}
{"text":"This place is great, awesome service, great fresh food. Staff speaks English. Great date place, great ambience"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I was growing up in Toronto that I even remember when it was called the Pink Pearl. But they changed managements a couple of times and are now called Pearl Harbourfront Chinese Restaurant. Well. I would usually go there for family events and we would have a group of at least 20 people so there was a ton of food. The waiters are excellent and very attentive. They knew us enough that they allowed us to BYOB without a bottle fee. They even kept the white wine chilled for us and poured it for us. They even let us bring our own fish and they would cook it for us. Of course that wasn't free but it wasn't as expensive as using their fish.   If you are going in smaller groups, try and get a view of the lake. It is gorgeous. Especially during a sunset.  To start, they put a plate of almonds and some sort of chinese chips on the table for everyone to share. From there, you get whatever you ordered. I am a big fan of the lobster noodles. The lobster is flavored really well and when paired with the noodles, is really good. The fried rice is also a hit. They have multiple types of fried rice but I really like their pineapple fried rice. The bak choy is also cooked really well and they add garlic to it for more flavor. The fish is also cooked excellently. This is a good chinese restaurant in Toronto. It is kind of expensive for dinner but that's because we also did have about 20 people. My family still comes here every now and then for special occasions.  Oh. They also validate parking so if you park next to the Queens Quay shopping centre, make sure you validate your pass here."}
{"text":"This Chinese Cuisine is pretty mediocre as dim sum goes. Everything was yummy, but nothing really stood out to me except for the chicken wings, which were really crisp and flavorful. The egg custard was a little dry. It took forever to get another pot of tea :/ The service was okay, never gruff or mean or anything, but not exactly happy and helpful. One thing I noticed about the dim sum is that you have no idea what the prices are until the bill. Might come back here for the awesome lake view, but otherwise I would recommend a different dim sum than this place."}
{"text":"Good food Fantastic view and very good service too! They are friendly, totally superb...."}
{"text":"While visiting relatives, they took me to Pearl Harbourfront Chinese Cuisine for dim sum. We didn't make a reservation so we had to sit separately but closer by.  We had a variety including Eggplant with Shrimp, Steamed Shrimp and Leek Dumpling, Crystal Shrimp Dumpling, Shui Mai, Crispy Shrimp and Scallop Dumpling with Sweet and Sour Sauce, Fried Sticky Rice Dumpling, Beef Crepes, Fish shaped Osmanthus Jelly, Wonton Soup (with pork, crabmeat and mushroom), Pan Fried Water Chestnut Cake, and Beef Tripe.   My favorites were the Beef Crepes (because they had parsley and water chestnuts), Osmanthus Jelly (because they had lychee and gojiberry), and Pan Fried Water Chestnut Cake (because it was chrysanthemum flavored)."}
{"text":"Coming here on a Sunday and found out they don't have any congeee on Sundays. I was super disappointed...but nothing I can do.  Anyways, I heard they renovated the restaurant and it does look pretty nice! Great views if you sit by the window was well. The service was decent compared to other dim sum places.   The unique aspect of this restaurant is that they push the traditional carts around and you can pick/choose as they go by...or another alternative is to order off the menu (which we did). Waiting for the carts to come by was just too slow!  Food review - it was decent but I think Crown Princess is better. They lack creativity and definitely variety."}
{"text":"Sad experience.  We used to be regular patrons as after trying different Chinese restaurants in Toronto, we found the Pearl the best.  When they opened a second restaurant in Bayview Village we were very happy not to drive to the Harbourfront for a good Chinese meal.  But alas, it turned out the food at the Bayview  Village was much to be desired, but we were hoping in time they will improve to match the Harbourfront standard.  In stead we found today that the Harbourfront meals became as bad if not worse.  The only good item on the dinner menu were the fortune cookies.  The soup tasted like hot dishwater,  the rainbow filling was bland, the Phoenix nest had no flavour, we could not eat the vegetable. Hope they. Will improve."}
{"text":"Best. Dim Sum.  Period.  Service is impeccable.  No sooner is one plate emptied that it disappears within seconds!  The decor is a bit dated and the place could use a good steam clean (including the windows), but it doesn't detract from their job, which is to feed me excellent quality dim sum action, and for that, they do get their 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food and above average service, but you're paying a major premium for a view of the lake and the fact that's this isn't an unkempt run-down restaurant in Chinatown. Personal favourites are the duck (comes in two servings - traditional, then stir-fried with vegetables) and dim sum. They often offer Groupons, which makes the $18 noodles a tad more justifiable. Overall, a comfortable dining experience, but expect to pay 20-40% more than restaurants in Chinatown which serve similar dishes."}
{"text":"oh my gosh...best dim sum ever had. Kinda pricey but for sure worth every penny. its not greasy or msg loaded in the food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with friends, but food wasn't memorable... Well, I'll probably remember that we paid $65 for a pretty bland bass dish. Pity star for good service and the view. Besides that, overpriced and nothing special."}
{"text":"great food. little pricy. decent service. great views of the lake."}
{"text":"Consistent food here though on the pricey side. Food is clean, not greasy and not packed with msg. Highly recommend the crispy chicken and steamed bass. Staff are friendly and the view is magnificent. If you have kids, ask for a plate of their shrimp chips for them, usually on the house."}
{"text":"Great location, average service and not a very clean restaurant Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It 's great place and spectacular waterside view.  The food are awesome and real traditional Chinese food.  Especially, they provide great service!! A must go!!"}
{"text":"dimsum with a view. such a unique little place. classy and refined, probably more suited for a special occasion lunch. the dining room is quiet and the servers are abnormally polite for a chinese establishment haha food quality is fantastic but it comes with a hefty price ta. one thing to keep in mind though is that parking is a horrible horrible problem here, i don't know if there's some secret parking garage somewhere but finding parking by the harbour is a little challenging for ppl new to the area. also, during lunch hours, you'll wish you could wear sunglasses inside, it sounds weird but really, the water reflects all the sun shine rays right into your face while eating lol"}
{"text":"Expensive? Yes. But it's probably the best dim sum in the megacity (aka not markham)  Sample of 30+ meals:  Must Try: - Sticky rice in lotus leaf [nah mai gai]... the legit full size - Stuffed green pepper - Steamed BBQ pork buns [Cha siu bao] - Steamed scallop dumpling - Scallop cheung fun - Silver noodle / shrimp / chicken dish that comes with a glass bowl over it  Recommended: - Sesame seed balls [jin doy] - Shrimp dumplings [ha gow] - curry squid - beef tripe - chicken feet  Good: - Siu mai - Turnip cakes [law bak go]  Conclusion: Just order anything that starts with an S, (minus the sponge cake)  Bonus: Incredible views, even in the winter.  P.S. The harbourfront area can be very expensive. For a sit down meal + lake view, the price isn't absurd."}
{"text":"Pearl Habourfront was situated in a great location right on the water facing the islands. The views were hard to beat but the food was just meh. We came here for dimsum as I heard the dimsum in toronto was hard to beat but unfortunately Pearl did not hold up to its hype. The dimsum was on the warm/cold side as the dimsum was pushed around carts. We sat in the furthest possible location from the kitchen so by the time it got to us, it was not very hot. The rice noodle rolls with shrimp and beef were very thick which made it one of the worst I ever had. Although the other spareribs and chicken feet were on par.  Soak up the views and hope you get a good spot by the kitchen!"}
{"text":"We came here for mother's day. Made reservations ahead of time but still had to wait for 35 minutes until I went over to ask again how much longer and they seated us right away at that point. It was my first time here, liked the decor, and it was nice that they seated us with a water view. Unfortunately we only had the carts coming by that had one last plate on them (had gone around the entire room before coming to us). Fortunately the manager/head waiter saw that and brought us the dim sum menu to order from. That was great so that everything was hot and fresh when it arrived. It took asking 3 different people to get water, but I get that it was Mother's Day and was extra busy. The dim sum is good (not all shrimp dishes taste the same like at some of the Chinatown dim sum places). We had the har gow, shrimp toast, turnip cakes, shrimp w cabbage (not my favourite), the grilled green beans are garlicky and flavourful, just the right amount of tenderness. It came to $56.00 for two of us. Not cheap but I'd probably come back for the view, fresh food and elegant decor."}
{"text":"The attraction of Pearl Harbourfront Chinese Cuisine is the view, tasteful decoration and great services.  It also enjoys the benefits of limited competition in the area.  The food?  It is okay but not so much as to worthy of the price.    We came for a dim sum lunch with out-of-town friends who wanted to enjoy the harbourfront.  The weather was nice, so there was beautiful natural light in the dining room.  The view through the big windows was an enjoyment of its own.  The interior decoration was tasteful with an understated elegance.  The servers were all fluent in English, as I noted that most customers were not Asian.  The services were courteous, friendly and effective.  They promptly refilled our teapot, but they could have removed the empty dishes faster.  The various dim sum dishes we ordered were delicious, but no more competent than any non flat-priced dim sum restaurants uptown.  Pearl Harbourfront's selling point is the location and environment.  Its dim sum is not bad.  The services is great.  I enjoy the overall dining experience.  There is not much competition in the area during weekend, so I won't mind eating here again if someone requests it.  For better value and the same or better quality of food, I will go midtown or uptown.  Afterall, just the parking costs $8.  Overall, 4 stars.  The food and services are 3 stars.  The view and the environment worths 1 star on its own."}
{"text":"Good dim sum, wish they had traditional carts to pick off of but still very good and great view! Service is subpar but when is service at Chinese restaurants ever good??"}
{"text":"The closest thing to good dim sum since my visit to Hong Kong. My husband loves loves loves dim sum so we go there every chance we get and every time it doesn't disappoint. My favorite is the sticky rice. The view is very nice and the waiters are very attentive and helpful. I know we could find cheaper places but being so close to our place is a plus!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of dim sum places and this is one of the costliest one.  Each item on their dim sum menu costs about two times more than the dim sum restaurants downtown or uptown.  The food was fresh, tasted alright but not worth the price.  The best item I got was the pork & shrimp dumpling - the shrimp was huge and literally melted in my mouth.  The atmosphere is very nice with a good view of harbourfront."}
{"text":"Oh, Pearl. My aunties have been taking me here for the last 20 years, and nothing has changed. The food is superb, and the view is just as good. I understand it's a little pricier than other Toronto dim summaries, but what can you expect with real estate like that?"}
{"text":"I was having a craving for dim sum while I visited Toronto with my boyfriend this past weekend.  As far as I've heard from tons of people, the Chinese food on the outskirts of Toronto proper is where it's at.   However, without a rental car I searched for a place that could satisfy me.    I'm usually skeptical of touristy places, and I knew that being down by the harbor might make this the ultimate Chinese food trap.  Still, we walked to the harbor from the hotel and put our names down for a table.    A 30 minute wait ended up being less than 10 minutes, and we got a table by the windows.  The food was actually very good.  Being from NYC I've had some pretty bad dim sum, and this did not disappoint.  I'm not necessarily looking for mind-blowing, avante garde renditions of my favorites.  Just do the dim sum staples well and I'm as happy as a clam.  That being said, I'm glad that we went.  Downside, of course, was the price.  It wasn't a shocker, and being where it is I expected to pay a bit more than usual.  All is well though.  If I'm caught in Toronto without a car and a craving for Chinese food I would probably come back."}
{"text":"Slightly (emphasis on slightly) more expensive than some of the Chinatown options but the almost negligible price difference is more than offset by the pleasant dining experience and views. Another way to put it would be that this is super cheap for such a plush establishment. The name also cracks me up...Americans must love it lol.   The food itself was very good, not 10/10 compared to HK but every dish was well presented, prepared and very tasty and if you're comparing to NY then definitely 10/10. I was eating alone so only managed to work through 7 dishes and i get the impression that there were some others that i really should have tried...maybe next time. The curried mak yue jai (baby squid) was as good as i've had, curry wasn't overpowering. The har gau and siu mai were tasty (i've had better but i've also had wayyy worse), the skin was the right balance between maintaining its structure and not being too thick. The siu mai were beautifully constructed with a big prawn on top. The lo bak gou were nice but they fall into the mushy, paste variety like a croquette rather than fresh with discernible slices of turnip...to be fair sometimes the mushy ones are exactly what you want...almost like comfort food so no points off for this. The zin joeng ke zi (fried stuffed aubergine) is the best i've had, normally the aubergine is the temperature of molten lava so you have to wait till the very end of the meal to eat them, this was ready to eat as soon as it hit the table. The little sweet custard buns (lo sa bao... i think?) were excellent not so runny that they erupted and sprayed out everywhere as soon as i took a bite but not hard and paste like.  The people working there were very friendly and helpful and didn't bat an eyelid at me arriving in gym gear. 7 fairly large dim sum dishes + tip came to around CAD50, so $7 odd per dish. Well worth it for the overall experience.  All in all a very enjoyable experience. Will be back next time i'm in HK."}
{"text":"I used to come here in the past because I really enjoyed their view of the water. But it had been almost for years since I last came here. Dim sum was what I often came here for in the past. And sometimes, I would come here for dinner--though not as frequent as for dimsum.  It was a slow night when we came here on Thursday. That was great news for us because that meant service was going to be pretty quick: we didn't have to wait very long for our food. We got the grouper with king mushroom and the eggplant with spicy garlic sauce. YUMZ! Both were excellent individually, but were also great together as well. The fish was a little over cooked (just a little bit), but otherwise the dishes were excellent.  The service was polite and very prompt. The food tasted good! They were both very flavoursome. Pricewise...I think it's OK, but probably a little more than it could be. I thought it was worth the price though."}
{"text":"High quality dim sum with a beautiful view. I love that they have carts here and they carry some less common items like shrimp toast. The costs reflect normal up charge in the area for the view.  Service was good with water glasses refilled and forks brought promptly for the children in our party.  I'm not a big tentacle/grilled calamari person, but those at our table that do enjoy them found them excellent, coated in spicy salt.  Too full for the adorable mango pudding in various hello kitty and koi fish shapes."}
{"text":"Okay, Let's do the food cost math. Rice, Bok Choy, chicken, Peadpods. It's an okay meal, but for $100.00  I think I can eat out twice and enjoy the leftovers for two more evenings. C'mon people- yeah yeah the rent is high on the waterfront, but were talkin' Chinese food here.."}
{"text":"Whenever I have guests visiting Toronto, eating dim sum at this Pearl location is a 'must.'   On the second floor, you get a beautiful view of the lake. It's not a cheap eat here as you can probably find cheaper places in Chinatown; however, this place is quite clean with some great menu items and, as mentioned, there's a great view of the water. Parking is a pain here (especially with the construction) so try using the TTC to get to Pearl. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food, but I can even eat (and enjoy) at this restaurant.  A few days ago, we ordered items from both the regular and dim sum menus. I would highly recommend the spicy eggplant (portion is generous so you can enjoy it the day after at home) and the rainbow Crystal something something (I order it each time, but can never remember it's name).  Good for: tourists, Chinese food"}
{"text":"Pearl Harbourfront is a great place to take visitors to Toronto (For the view), business clients (because you're not paying), and friends with no cars who don't want the Spadina Chinatown restaurants.  Went here for dim sum for the first time in years, and like other other posters, the price is really expensive... it came to $26pp for dim sum!  I also don't recall us eating anything super extravagant, given the limited menu.  The quality of the food is pretty great.  Everything tasted fresh and not greasy, even the fried items.  They had some twists on classics, like their fried pork dumplings and fried taro dumplings (had some curry to the meat).    For dessert we ordered the sesame balls, and THEY WERE TO DIE FOR!  I am still thinking about them now and salivating.  I wish I took a picture but I was too busy eating it and feeding my son, who also loved it.  It is covered in black and white sesame, and inside there is sesame paste but not super thick so it's a bit runny and warm, which works so well encased in the chewy and crunchy sesame shell.  I would give that 6 stars out of 5.  Service: Decent, fairly prompt, friendly, and had a lot of high chairs on hand, which was good, given that there were many strollers out by the entrance.  Ambiance: Bright, clean, simple, elegant and beautiful view of the lake, even when you aren't by the window.  If you want great dim sum at a decent price, you should head north.  In absence of that, this is a decent choice, or Crown Princess by Bay and Wellesley."}
{"text":"Great location by the waterfront with beautiful views. Custom order dim sum with some cart and tray service. Decor is very classy and attractive. Everything came out quickly and the food was good. Approx. $140 for 7 people, but we over-ordered."}
{"text":"It was a toss up between a 3 and a 4 star. I think the average rating of a 3.5 on yelp is pretty much on the money. When I visited Pearl I used a groupon, which took 25 dollars off my bill at dinnertime, and I totally feel I got my monies worth. If I had paid regular prices though, my bill would have been inline with what I've paid at more high end restaurants, and I don't think Pearl is in that same class, with that said the food was good.  The staff is very attentive... though almost to the point where they are too attentive. It's the kind of place that puts your chopsticks and fork away for you between courses. And stand nearby while you are discussing what you want to order, and you feel a little weird because you want a little privacy. Also, when they serve the mains, they dish out a little bit of the main out on to your plates for you. (hence why there are more photos of dim sum type dishes, and not mains on yelp) To some that is good service though, it's just not something I am that used to, or really need. On top of that, they really like pushing their their rice dishes. I had two different employees ask me, \"are you sure you don't want any rice?\"... I figure they push the rice because it's one of their big markup items which they make a lot of money on.  As for the food, we had the shanghai dumplings, which were big and fat and fantasticcc. The shrimp and pork dumplings (shui mai) were good, but nothing out of the ordinary you couldn't get at another good dim sum place. The BBQ pork steamed buns were yummy too. For the mains we had the crispy honey beef, and the kung pao chicken. The crispy honey beef was really sweet and not lacking on the honey, and it was definitely unique. But the kung pao chicken definitely needed more POW. I wouldn't describe it being spicy at all, and like George Steinbrenner... this yelp reviewer likes his chicken spicy!"}
{"text":"Not the most impressive dim sum I've ever had, but definitely the most expensive. The dim sum here is delicious, fresh, and authentic. My only quam is it is way overpriced compared to my usual places. I guess it should be expected once you incorporate location and venue. If you're nearby and can't make it all the way up to China Town, pop in. Otherwise, opt for something a little more economical."}
{"text":"as a non-western person, this place isn't westernized.  excellent dim sum and dinner dishes.  service is consistently fast and friendly.  the place is certainly more expensive than chinatown.  you pay for the view and the location."}
{"text":"Excellent food and stunning view!   Came here with a group of friends. This place is very clean and quiet, a nice change from the typical dim sum places downtown. The dim sum selection is very good and we ordered a large variety of fried items. The fried curry taro was the best for me.  The har gao and Siu Mai were also very good.   Pricing is higher than most dim sum places but for the cleanliness and view that you get it is absolutely worth it! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great view of the lake. They serve traditional dim sums, dumplings and all the goodies come with cute little steamers. Their egg yolk lava bao is really good, savoury and sweet, hot and fresh. The other dishes were good too. But they don't have a lot of choices for desserts. I ordered almond tofu and was disappointed. Plus, the staffs were always around to serve u but so serious with no smile on their face, which made me a little stressed"}
{"text":"Customer service was poor no one smiled. Food was good can't believe they charge for a second iced tea"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!  Best dim sum in town I would say!   For dinner, it is a western service Chinese  restaurant.  All the other Chinese restaurants I've been they serve what you ordered without order or time lapse- they basically put everything on your table as soon as they can.  But here Pearl serve dinner in a order that make sense and they pace it out base on how fast I eat, so dishes are always hot and fresh.  It's no rush, it makes me feel very comfortable.  I find it heart warming to be able to enjoy Chinese dishes like French cuisine."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and I enjoyed it.  Let's begin with table clothes.  For environmental and aesthetic reasons I am not a huge fan of the plastic tablecloths I've come to expect at most dim sum places.  So it was a nice change to see cloth.    Three of us shared six or seven dishes and our bill came to around $63.  So yes, I understand people's beef with the price.  The food was pretty good though.  The only dish that was a stinker was the calamari.  It was tough and had little flavour.  Otherwise, I thought stuff was solid.  The Char siu baau was different; you could really taste the 5 spice.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum restaurant downtown. Nice views of the lake, and usually does not take that long to get a seat (for 2 or 3). Waiters are efficient like most chinese restaurants, and does not try to be something they are not."}
{"text":"My first time at Dim Sum. A local friend took me here. Quite the experience! We got a table facing the Harbor which was pretty. We chose from the menu, as there also was an option of a la carte. More than enough food for two people. Food tasted fresh and delicious, Service was great except if you dont speak the language you may have to ask for an Englsh speaking waiter/waitress. Very friendly regardless. Place is within the mini mall and up at the top of the escalators. Best part is it is right on the Harbor and you can walk off all of what you ate!"}
{"text":"The dimsum quality was good but service is seriously bad. One would expect them to have better customer service overall with that kind of price and location, but the fact that we had to ask for the dimsum menu 10 minutes after being seated and take 15 minutes to catch one server says something about their service level. But they were very attentive when we were paying though, I guess the only time you should take care of your guests is when they decide on the tip amount."}
{"text":"A good 3.6  Good location with nice view during daytime, for sure. At night, it is dark outside. We were seated at the window, but did not bother looking outside at all as there was nothing to see (perhaps prices should be decreased when it is nite outside there...).  Dim sum are good, although too big to my personal taste. I like my dumpling to be no more than 2 fabulous bites. But at least, that's really worth the price. 6$ for 4 huge dumplings, that is decent.  Pekin duck is OK (rice pancakes are on the fluffy side), second \"crystal\" course is really good.  All in all, good and relatively classy Chinese place. Good for a date (during the day or early Summer nites) or if you are around. For Chinese food craving, I will still go to some of my other favs."}
{"text":"This place really made me realize how big of a difference ambiance makes for food. Had I had the same mediocre, over-cooked dimsum at a dingy Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, the food would probably be worse in my head and definitely the restaurant would be 2-star. However, due to the prime location it is in, and the fact that I was there on a sunny day, sitting near the window, the view made up for the somewhat crummy food.  ______________________________ Location: 2nd floor in the Harbourfront building, with a corner location and a beautiful view to the lake. Restaurant is bright and clean. Very nice.  Food: My friend and I, we ordered a LOT. Most of which were ridiculously overcooked, and obviously really hot. I think they have a huge stack of steamers in the back and they just leave the food in there all day. - leaf wrapped rice: the leaves were dried up and stuck on to the rice. The flavour was okay, not authentic enough, and a little bland - spinach dumplings: the clear skin literally breaks apart at the touch of chopstick. None of the al dente feel that skin should have. I might have liked the flavour better if it wasn't so steamy hot. - chicken feet: the flavour was all there (in fact it was really tasty) and of course the bones fell apart as soon as you picked it up, somewhat in a good way, but you can tell the outerskin has been sucked of its moisture due to the overcookedness - deep-fried squid tentacles: BEST dish of the meal. The only dish that didn't feel overcooked, amazingly tasty, and wasn't cold (unlike many of the dimsum restaurants with push carts). - fried leek and shrimp dumplings: a bit cold,but really good - scallop rice noodle wrap (chun fun) - OK - black bean pork ribs: they used the good ribs, and a bit salty but pretty good. - bbq pork bun: not a huge fan, a little too sweet - garlic baby bokchoy veggie: the garlic was roasted and not stir-fried with the vegetable, weird. It was okay... - jelly fish: weird dish for dimsum, but okay.   Price: EXPENSIVE! $5.50 for a medium, $6 for large (scallop rice noodle), $7.50 for special (jelly fish, baby bok choy) Our bill worked out to be $75 after tax and tip...for what i mentioned above. Ridiculous.  Service: Ironically, it's your typical chinese service. Other than the fact that they spoke English, everyone pretty much ignores you and forgets to give you things when you ask for them. They do have push cart service, but they come around randomly and it's the same carts that go around and around, with nothing you actually want in them. You're better off ordering from the menu than wait for the push cart.  ______________________  Funnies:   - they have to take the push carts up and down the stairs, and every time the push cart lady has to ask some male server to help her.  - also THE PUSH CART LADIES CALL OUT THE FOODS IN ENGLISH, which, to be honest, makes the food somewhat incomprehensible.   Would I go back? Only if I want to bring someone special to go see the view while having dimsum...so very not likely."}
{"text":"An awesome, awesome dim sum restaurant. Their food is great and the desserts are to die for. I could eat here all the time. The view is great if you get a good table. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"My parents recently came to visit, and I knew that my dad would get a kick out of watching the planes take off and land at Billy Bishop while eating dinner, so I booked an early dinner at The Pearl.  It wasn't the best laid plan, considering that sunset was at 6:20 pm, but my dad enjoyed the show, and we all enjoyed the food.  The funny thing about The Pearl at non-dim sum times, is that it straddles a funny line between Authentic Chinese food and \"Good, Bad Chinese Food\".  No complaints from us - but you have to keep this in mind.  We had some great wait staff at our disposal who were initially, literally at our beck and call.  They stood right behind us, just waiting!  But they soon relaxed and were fairly attentive throughout the evening, although not as omni-present as before :)  Volumes were huge - and we were 4 very stuffed people!  We ordered: 1. General Tao's chicken (my boyf's request) 2. Sauteed pea shoots 3. Garlic & pork eggpant 4. Tofu and vegetables (a custom order) 5. Soy Sauce noodles  (A very balanced Asian family order!)  Everything had great flavours, but was a tad bit oily for my taste.  I chalk this up to toeing over the line onto the \"Good, Bad Chinese Food\" side of things.  Overall, I was happy to try The Pearl at a non-dim sum opportunity - I wasn't disappointed in the least, and will be back (at noon or night!)"}
{"text":"Two stars for the view and ok fried rice. This place has a fantastic view. If you're willing to pay big bucks for that, it's ok.  Expensive by any standards for Chinese food. Service was rather silly. Food came in bits and pieces (chicken first, rice 10 mins later). Server forgot our drinks.  Food was blaah - when you find only one poultry item on the menu that's not sweet, you know you're not really eating Chinese. From dim sums to all the mains - nothing was good.  *Sigh* such a waste of money."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Toronto - close to the best I've had anywhere. The food could not be better and the views of the lake in the summer are sure to impress.  While some say it's expensive you can easily get out of there for $25 or a person all in. The only downside is that on the weekend you will have to wait a long long time."}
{"text":"Once again, an extremely overrated experience. This isn't the best dim sum the city has to experience but it might be the most expensive   See pictures for what we selected  Honestly, nothing was amazing. Nothing was even great. We tried so many things... Pork, shrimp, eggplant, beef. Everything was bland. Just meh. Even the sticky rice was over cooked. They make them in batches so maybe some turn out better.   Around noon, they bring out all the popular food options on cart. Expedient and great if you want to see what you get. This also means the food is not warm though.  There's a nice view but a crazy draft by windows.   The place is also run down if you pay close attention. Exposed ceiling vents, peeling walls...  Makes me worry about the care people take  Worse yet, the service staff was so rude. They barely checked in, not even to take the order. We had to ask for water. And they tried to rush us out. Very rudely.   I will not be back. Worse spent $30 ever.   I say head to Spadina/Chinatown for real(er) deal. Lose the Harbourfront chic and gain in value and taste   I RECOMMEND: The green beans in bean sauce. Most flavourful dish... which says a lot. The pan fried pork dumplings were a distant second.  EXTRA TIP: Beat the brunch rush. It's empty at 11 and lineup-cause-it's-packed by noon"}
{"text":"OMG?This is the best!!! Deep fried duck egg bun is fantastic, so juicy that it flows out from the bun!!! The restaurant is right beside the lake of Ontario, great view! But you got to come early or make reservations to get a window seat. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pearl for years, typically for weekend dim sum. I think this is the best dim sum in Toronto on a combination of price (typically 20 pp) service (professional) and environment (white linen tablecloths, baby friendly, incredible view of the lake). If you are into seafood, you will think it is 5 stars as well. If you don't eat meat or seafood... Don't go."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with my aunt who lives in Toronto. The birds nest dish is quite good but it has come to my attention that this restaurant serves shark fin soup. If you don't like supporting animal cruelty and the devastation of wild marine ecosystems, I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"One point they got is for the location and the view. Then the rest starts going downhill...   For an Asian restaurant, it had a dark washroom, but at least it was clean.  The service was decent but not when we were given the bill and basically told that someone else needs the table. So yeah, we were kicked out - like most Chinese restaurant.   Food wise, oh man, such a disappointment on my favourite dish at any dim sum place - steamed beef tripe with ginger. This place came with some chilli oil and it was mushy. I want it chewy and hot (in temperature). They ruined a dish I was looking forward to devouring!!!   The veggie dumplings was over cooked. It felt apart after one bite. The large beef balls was just ok. Nothing stood out much except for the spicy eggplant which was not too spicy but it had a nice flavour to it. I don't like salty food.   Verdict: I wouldn't go back to it unless someone is paying for the bill. I'll rather try the restaurants on the first floor."}
{"text":"Good flavour on many of the dishes. Over priced. Most dishes were overly oily.  Best flavour: stir fried green beans in a sweetened vinegar and black bean sauce.  Most authentic: lo bak go (turnip cake). Quite delicious!  Too sweet: the cha siu bao (bbq pork buns).  Low quality: siu mai (shrimp topped pork \"dumplings\").  If you don't mind burning some cash on dim sum, or if you want a super clean harbourfront restaurant experience, this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the priciest Chinese restaurants that I've been to but the price reflects the location and view. Get a window seat because you can get a beautiful view of the harbourfront. The service is also a notch above most Chinese restaurants and so is the interior.  The shrimp dumplings were pretty good. Amongst one of the better ones I've had. They were large and there weren't any unpeeled shrimp in them, which some restaurants leave in carelessly. The scallop dumpling, which I've never had before, was also good and filled with shrimp and scallops.  We also wanted to try some non-dim sum dishes so we ordered the rainbow crystal (?), which is the dish you get after peking duck... with the iceberg lettuce filled with minced pork and goodness. It was pretty good though although I've had better elsewhere. Lastly, we got the standard Yeung Chow fried rice which was good as well but again not the best I've had as some of it was clumping a little bit. Considering, the fried rice was over double the price at most other Chinese restaurants, I expected a little more but again the prices seem to reflect the atmosphere and view, not the food.  The restaurant is on the second level of a building so it's a bit harder to find."}
{"text":"I was down there for a stroll and went to Pearl for a dim sum lunch. Food was average and service was okay. The view however was spectacular."}
{"text":"Visits: 1st Rating: 4.5* Service: Extremely nice & went out of their way to make sure we were accommodated.  Came here on a high recommendation by a friend who lives in Toronto. Left very satisfied. After our trip to several parts of Canada & trying various Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants, it seems that Canadian Chinese cuisine has set a very high bar for Chinese restaurants in the U.S. And the view is spectacular.  The dishes were all so good. So much flavor without the fattiness, oily feel like some dim sum places. We were amazed how different Chinese cuisine is in Canada verses the U.S. Not to mention the server's attitudes. They are so helpful & friendly, just like all the other Canadian citizens. Makes you want to move to Canada. =)  Black Sesame Balls were amazing!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a bit expensive for dim sum! But there is no competition and I like to think that the extra cost is because of the prime real estate.  It really is in an awesome location. And with the lack of competition, relatively decent dim sum. And its really clean! I had fun examining how white our tea pot was.  Not to much it was a nice day and I could see the Harbour pretty well. They also have no problem seating 2 people on a 4-person table. Get a seat next to the window and make a reservation.. it does get a little busy.  Oh.. and I liked the decor too.. clean simple.. relaxing. I did not feel like someone was waiting for me to pay the bill so they could fill it up with the next people."}
{"text":"I went to this place because it is close to my work. We had several team lunches here. It costs about 20+ per person. This place is probably one of the most expensive dim sum restaurants in Toronto. I love dim sums, and ate a lot of dim sums. To me, the food here is average standard, good quality, but definitely overpriced. I am not paying for the food, but paying for the views. I think there are better dim sum places in Markham and Richmond Hill. The service is pretty good in Chinese restaurant standard, but I feel I lose something when the waitresses and waiters are nice. It does not feel like Chinese restaurants. I probably go here when there is a groupon deal available."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and stayed nearby, so I figured I'd try it.  If you go at night in the winter, there's really almost nothing to see, so don't expect a great view under these circumstances.  The restaurant itself is very unassuming but large, and when I arrived on a Monday night, there weren't but a few large tables full of families dining.  The service was excellent, almost too attentive, but definitely not poor.  The Dim Sum is very good, but by no means am I a Dim Sum expert.  I had the Shrimp and Spinach, and found it to be very flavorful but not overly salty.  I also had a chicken with sauteed vegetables.  It was served over well-prepared white rice and despite there being a lack of sauce with the dish, it was also very flavorful without causing me heart trouble from extreme salt levels.  This is a good place to dine but it does seem a bit overpriced, even for an American getting a good conversion rate from CAD to USD."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for work and desperately wanted some dim sum. This place was closest to my hotel, so I tried it without looking into reviews or the menu beforehand (I was starving and desperate). What a mistake. Super overpriced and the worst dim sum I've ever had. I gave an extra star for the beautiful view of the water."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for mother's day. The view of the lake in the spring/summer is amazing. Food was alright though. I eat a lot of Chinese cuisine at home and at restaurants and this place was nothing special in my opinion. Prices were expensive compared to your regular dim sum restaurants (you're essentially paying for the view though). I think it's nice to come here at least once to try and get a nice view of the lake. Other than that the place does not stand out in my mind.  Service was okay, typical dim sum restaurant service. Ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant. Very modern and clean looking."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  The Char siu I had lunch here today and I enjoyed it.  Two of us shared six or seven dishes and our bill came to around $63.  so it's a bit expensive."}
