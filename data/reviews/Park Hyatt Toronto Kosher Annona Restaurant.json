{"text":"We went to dinner at the Park Hyatt Annona. They provide kosher (COR supervision) food. We emailed the hotel and they emailed us the menu in advance and took our reservation. The service was very professional and the ambience was great. The food was delicious and the main course portion was huge, we had leftovers. While it was pricey it was well worth it."}
{"text":"(Oops, I meant to post this on the main Park Hyatt Yelp page, but accidentally posted on the restaurants page. I am not removing this because Kosher Annona is also 5 Stars! We have eaten there many times and are always extremely happy with the food and the service!)  The Park Hyatt is everything you would expect in a first class hotel, and more. Perfectly located in the Yorkville area, you have Toronto at your doorstep. The rooms are spacious and quiet. The staff is very friendly and have always gone out of there way to be helpful. We have stayed here many times, but this last visit was by far the best. This was the first time we've traveled with our 10 month old mini poodle puppy named Dude. The hotel was so accommodating. They supplied bowls for his food and water, plus a very comfortable bed for our furry companion. We worried how Dude would handle a big noisy city being a California beach dog, and where (and if) he would go to the bathroom. Luckily right around the corner from the hotel is Prince Arthur street, a quiet suburban feel in the heart of a busy city. He had no problems.  The Park Hyatt is a destination hotel, and if you don't want to leave your furry friend at home, they will make them as welcome as you."}
{"text":"Good price drinks.  They do tea on weekends. Maybe even on weekdays.  Amazing customer service. Attached to the park hyatt so very convenient. I ordered a bottle of wine. They did not have it. Instead the waitress gave me an even better bottle for the same price ! Amazing staff."}
{"text":"I'm shocked there's only one review here.   My husband and I went to Annona a couple days ago for Summerlicious lunch. This has been my best Summerlicious experience ever ... also the most expensive one but I guess quality comes at a price ;)  We ordered one set from the Summerlicious menu and one main separate. From the preset menu, we got: Crab cake appetizer - small crab cake but it came with a delicious chunky guacamole Seafood salad - I am NOT a salad person but this was really good. The Lemon vinaigrette they used was delicious - note: I had asked them not to use their usual dressing due to a dietary restriction  Oreo cheesecake: rich and creamy, like cheesecake should be   The separate main we got was a lobster mac n cheese. I tried a couple bites and it was basically rich, buttery goodness.  The server took some time to come take our order in the beginning (maybe 15 minutes) but other than that, service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"We recently tried the kosher dining at Anona restaurant and had a wonderful time!!  The food was delicious! It comes all wrapped from the kitchen and the waiters ask you permission to open it (since you are eating in a non kosher restaurant and it's coming from a diff floor). Once you're prepared for that all else is great. Ambience is really nice. Service was wonderful. Food was delicious! My one critique would be that it took a while for the first course to start. But once the food came, each course came promptly. But we did wait quite a bit at the beginning. Also pretty pricey but u know that going in. Nice for a special evening out!!! Great that they have valet parking in the hotel. The kosher dining options aren't offered every evening so make sure to call in advance to check or get on their email list."}
