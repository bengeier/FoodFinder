{"text":"I'm a little perplexed by some of the negative reviews on here.  We've been visiting this restaurant for years--both before the \"change\" when they were El Tolteca and since they've become Plaza Grande.  Even though their menu changed (slightly) during that time, the food was always very tasty and a good value for the price.  If I had any criticism it would be that their vegetarian selections aren't as varied as some places, but they still have plenty to pick from and I've never been disappointed in the flavor or variety of the entrees.

As for the service, the wait staff is attentive but does not hover over you every three minutes.  Food arrives very quickly every time.

Mexican restaurants sometimes come and go, and we've lost a few \"go-to\" places, but we found a new one in Plaza Grande."}
{"text":"We moved here from San Francisco California, it's been hard finding good Mexican food. The food is good, the prices cannot be beat. We paid 12 dollars and got to lunch specials. There are some very American things like hard taco shells and cheese burgers. The salsa is good, served with warm chips. Great service too."}
{"text":"this is really good Mexican food and the staff is very attentive and friendly. Been here a few times in the last few weeks and brought some family members the last time and everyone was impressed with the quality as well as the quantity of food here.
Highly recommend this place for food, atmosphere and service, you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years under new and old management. I have had nothing but good experiences with good service. I go here because the food is consistent,  fast and priced nicely. I may not have a very refined palette for authentic Mexican,  but I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews on here. Though most ppl are more inclined to speak out than when upset. Don't let the negative reviews deter you. Go try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Well, 3rd trip....I had hoped It was just a \"bad day\" for the Employees at PLAZA GRANDE...at my Last trip there, so When The Manager said

 \"\"\"Comment from Isaac J. of Plaza Grande 
Business Manager..7/8/2016  We're sorry to hear that we didn't click with you, Ken. We can assure you that all of our meals are made fresh in house, but we're disappointed that you were unimpressed. As for our servers, we strive to only hire the best of the best. If you ever give us another chance in the future, we hope you leave with a better impression. 
Sincerely, ...Plaza Grande Manager.\"\"\"

Well, Mr.J...Sorry, I hate giving bad reviews..truly!..so, I went and got 2 Beef quesidella, One for me and one for my wife.. and a 4 dollar bag of supposedly made fresh in house, More like MICROWAVED in house.. I truly don't understand why the food is never fresh...the Beef was what,,,20/60 mix of Ground beef and 60 Percent Fat, plus..how is it POSSIBLE to make it taste like Grissel?.. easy, now..I have no idea if  this is true..BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS FRESH...on Sunday morning..then placed in pre weighed baggies and tossed into the Freezer until used...for the entire week... Maybe my hopes are way too High..but my Amigos lol..who came here from Mexico in the 80's and now PROUD AMERICANS... have gagged when we went there..They jokingly said \"this is not Mexican...not Puerto Rico, nor Spanish in fact they got better at home.as it was not fresh...and the said it was pre weighed, put in freezer..only to be thawed..oh..the word I see here is Bland...hmm...good word..as it is BLAND!.. I will say the Greeter, a young man was very nice and explained every dish I asked about...well, took my Bag home only to toss it to Holly..My Dog .who has eaten an entire shoe before... so, when I handed hers to her..she sniffed it and then Barked at it... as if it was her enemy...that was WOW..I never saw that happen to any doggie bags I bring home..lol..she in fact GAVE it to her CAT...who , in turn, sniffed it..licked it and went upstaire and threw up...I hoped it was the food which the vet said yes, it was..as the bacteria was so..I have lived In Old Brooklyn basically all my life..a excellant place...this is on the border of Brooklyn and Old Brooklyn...I shop 90 percent in the shope there as They work hard and do great things...well, Plaza....you are not doing great..,food....mediocre...no, you have lost us forever...sad..:("}
{"text":"Previously El Tolteca. Loved this place before it switched owners and names. Service is not what it use to be and they messed up our orders numerous times in one visit, though it wasn't the first time it happened (but will be the last). The food quality is mediocre, but good. Very disappointed. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are looking for a lot of food for a decent price. My family ends up here at least once a month. I always end up with the flauta and its always soooo good."}
{"text":"What a shame. We used to really enjoy this place under its previous owners. The service was excellent and the food delicious, and they had the best chili rellenos I'd ever had. We tried the new incarnation a few weeks ago, and were sadly disappointed. Service was passable, but the food was absolutely substandard. Nothing was seasoned, making every selection bland. It truly seemed that everything on our plates came out of a can or a box. This was truly a disappointment."}
{"text":"The food has been Americanized. By that I mean, it's less authentic and more bland. And kids meal options that included chicken fingers and burgers (pet peeve of mine). Portion sizes are average, but certainly smaller than most other Mexican restaurants. 

Nothing really stood out as \"wow have to come back!\" The ubiquitous chips were unsalted, and the salsa was just ok. Steak ranchero was pretty much bland tomato sauce over thinly sliced piece of steak. Rice was just rice. As in white rice without seasoning, hence no flavor. Refried beans were good. Was disappointed to receive flour tortillas (3) as opposed to corn ones. Guacamole salad was ok. 

With the speed of everything coming out of the kitchen, I would have to suspect everything is premade and then run under a salamander (pro kitchen broiler). Not always a bad thing, just a note that probably explains the blandness of the food. Premade usually means unseasoned so they can be kept longer.

Prices are in the $7-13 range for most things. They do have a great selection for vegetarian options, so that's a plus. Service was good, though I did overhear another table ask for their check 4x."}
{"text":"Not sure why the Yelp reviews aren't great. Great service and the food was very tasty.  Had the Burrito California."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Placed to go order and received the wrong shells.  Placed a call to manager who was rude, acted like it wasn't their fault and didn't want to correct the situation."}
{"text":"We used to stop by all the time with previous owners, and the portions were large and food was good, service had a bit of a language barrier but could be dealt with. Now the food doesn't have the same taste, very bland. Portions have changed for the worse. Our drinks had what seemed to be no alcohol in them. We got charged for xtra chips. Even thought they might be having a off day, so tried again and was even worse. We talked to our waitress and she seemed to acknowledge what we were saying but seemed afraid to say anything and the guy at the register would do nothing so we just left. Dont know if we will even attempt to come back. Seems like every corner is being cut to make profits. At the cost of quality of food and service. I too bad this was a really good place"}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars I would. 30min wait time and they weren't that busy. Watched two other parties walk out. After we were seated it took atleast 20min for someone to come and bring chips, salsa and get our drink orders. It seemed like everytime the waitress left it took 20min to see her again. I ordered the chicken fajitas but never got the fajitas. A friend ordered a burrito and it wasn't even cooked! 5 different people came to \"serve\" us and they still forgot to bring drinks, fajitas etc. We had a party of 6 and specifically told the waitress that we were on 3 separate checks. She ended up putting everything on one bill, which was fine, but nothing was written down so we could see who ordered what so we could all split the bill.
It seemed like one waitress was serving the whole restaurant. After we were done we stood outside to discuss what we would do later that evening. Another lady and her daughter walked up and as we told them good luck, she said don't worry, I'm bringing my food back. She ended up getting her money back. That says something about this place. Never again will i eat here."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious. Everyone there is always very hospitable.  It has become our \"go-to\" Mexican joint and we recommend it to all of our friends. In addition, if you shop at the Giant Eagle nearby the plaza they offer a coupon on the back of your receipt. I usually get the burrito fajita with shrimp and steak because it's fantastic, but their specials have yet to fail me as well."}
{"text":"This place is not closed. Please update. Very much open. We love it here. Very friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"Drove 15+ minutes to get there before closing 9:20 and online it said 9:30 and the lady comes out and tells us they're closing in 5 minutes and the kitchen already closed very rudely pretty much saying we made it before closing but they weren't going to serve us. How polite. I work at a restaurant as well and we always serve our customers before our closing time, unless it's a minute over."}
{"text":"We were regular customers when this restaurant was under the prior owners. Went for the first - and last - time today. Our waiter was only minimally attentive, and the food's quality 
 has declined precipitously.  I ordered the chile relleno and instead of a whole stuffed pepper I was presented with a slice of green pepper buried in a thick layer of salty white cheese. My wife's margarita (I drank diet Coke) was also not, in her opinion, as good as before. With so many other Mexican restaurants in the area, there's no reason to go here."}
{"text":"Customer service was OK, not terrible, not memorable. Anything after two baskets of chips is an additional $1.25 charge. Not hard to go through chips when it's a table of four adults during dinner. Wasn't thrilled about that! The food was the average Mexican taste but the margarita's were good!"}
{"text":"Service was quite slow and and wasn't very busy. Margaritas were weak and not very tasty. And food was so disappointing. Ordered a taco and burrito and the burrito had meat sauce and cheese only: No lettuce or tomatos
Or sour cream to accompany the burrito. The sauce tasted like thinned tomato paste.

I asked for sour cream for my taco and didn't get it til after I ate the burrito and by then I didn't want my taco....so wasted 75 cents.

Won't be back even for a margarita."}
{"text":"Yes they have closed...BUT it is now re opened with a new owner.
The food is very good and so are the prices. If you're in the neighborhood,
please give the restaurant a try. Such friendly servers ... and this cook knows
his/her stuff. Muy Bueno!
New name is Plaza Nueva Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"Took the family to Plaza Grande for dinner the other night. We were promptly seated. I have never been to this restaurant or any restaurants that were in this location before. It's a large establishment with lots of seats and tables.

Tortillas and sauce were served immediately and our drink orders were taken. I decided to go with a frozen margarita grande, which ended up being very good. The glass was frozen to make it extra cold. But the extra cold wasn't necessary because frozen Margaritas are cold enough. I found myself wanting a regular glass because it froze my esophagus and brain. Damn that was cold! Despite being cold and tasty, the margarita wasn't as good as Cozumel's where the margaritas contain more alcohol and don't freeze your brain.

I ordered fish tacos for dinner, my daughter ordered chicken fajitas, and the wife ordered beef carnitas. All of our food was served hot and fresh. My fish tacos were very tasty and the fresh toppings made them delicious. I tasted my daughter's chicken fajitas and they were delicious. The chicken was tasty and well seasoned. My wife said her carnitas were also delicious.

We would definitely eat here again, but our favorite Mexican is still Cozumel.

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Even the one star is generous. Bad service, the staff didn't really speak English, the food felt store bought and expired. Very poor, would never go again."}
{"text":"I searched high and low for ANYTHING resembling good Mexican food in the Cleveland metropolitan area and found this place when it was El Tolteca. The quality of the food and the service has continued on so I continue to patronize.

November 2016 Update: Went in an hour before closing a couple of weeks ago. Was seated. Got chips and salsa. Hostess was lovely. For almost 20 minutes we sat without someone taking our drink order, food order, anything...My boyfriend made eye contact with the server that was helping the table about 20 feet from us many times and she acted like we weren't there and stopped making eye contact. We walked after the 20 minutes and a group of employees out at the front register gave us a warm \"Good night\" and \"Thank you.\" This included the server that ignored us. My boyfriend turned around to say something but decided we should just leave. Btw, if you read this, Management...she is the only female server there with short hair. This was our very favorite place. I am sad not to be going there anymore."}
