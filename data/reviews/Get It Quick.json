{"text":"I had wings with golden sauce. The sauce is a unique sauce in that it us a honey-tinged sweet sauce with a bit of tang. Very good. As always, the Mac and cheese was fabulous.  Will return."}
{"text":"The most delicious ribs I've ever had. Give them a call and place an order for pickup. So convenient and good!"}
{"text":"The outside appearance is pretty deceptive of what's in store when it comes to their food. My son and I were looking for a new spot to eat so we decided to give \"Get it Quick\" a shot. Upon entering it didn't look like they had much to offer. My son and I perused over the menu with a little apprehension. We decided to take a chance on the wings and a few sides. I was stuck between two sauces -- the black n gold and the liquid gold. Without hesitation the woman who worked there (who by the way made everyone there feel like special guest) let me sample without a second thought. After a quick taste test we went with the liquid gold. Thick, tangy and sweet. The chicken was fried to perfection, the sweet tangy sauce complimented the crispy slightly salty chicken to a T! We also had small side orders of greens, Mac n Cheese, and green beans.. when I say old school grandma soul tasting! I couldn't describe it any better. We'll definitely be back!!! Delicious!! Keep up the good work! Next time I'll try a burger!!"}
