{"text":"Was skeptical to eat here at first because of the lower reviews... service was great ( a little slow but that's okay, it's very busy)... management was very friendly as they walked around and or server is fantastic! I had a Reuben and my boyfriend had the BLT... both were amazing! Will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Got nachos and the chips were stale. The rest of my food was pretty good. The manager was walking around but looked very unfriendly and we actually saw him getting mad at a server.
The server uniforms are not very on par with how other servers/ bartenders dress at other pubs and restaurants and looks strange to be honest.
It was my girlfriend's birthday were celebrating and wanting to do a desert but they didnt even have any so we went to DQ afterwards.. 
They do have a great beer selection and the pineapple Martini my gf ordered (recommend by the bartender) was very good, and there's tonnes of TV's if you're into sports. 
Only reason we came was because Portly Piper was too long of a wait.. was happy with service but I feel like they need to step up almost every other aspect of their restaurant before I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, food was delicious, service was great! Would go again! I had the Chicken Souvlaki , it was great and everyone at my table liked their food. Decor was classic. A bit chilly inside though. That all being said my stomach started to hurt after eating the meal, not too sure why."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!!!!!!!!! We went here on a Saturday evening. It was not busy at all. There were about 3 couples on the patio and 5 people in the pub. We waited nearly 10 mins for one of the waitresses to notice we were at the door(there were 3 at the bar chatting to each other). When we finally were seated in the patio area, we were given menus and not even offered a drink of water. We waited an additional 15 mins and decided to leave. As we were leaving, we went past one of the waitresses... She looked right past us, not concerned that we left.  Disgusting customer service."}
{"text":"First time here and I was told by others it was too stale environment.  Not our impression.
I loved it - still quiet because it is new.  My hubby and I were impressed the portions are huge, everything tasted fresh, everything was cooked to perfection.
We both ordered fish and chips and a nice red bottle of wine. The fish was perfectly cooked 
the fries were a perfect golden colour.  The tarter sauce was extremely tasty with more then mayo and relish.    
The fish was great! The plate was big enough if we had ordered one plate and added an extra piece of fish it would have been enough. 
There are tvs everywhere so if there is a sports even you would like to watch its there.  I found it to be extremely clean and hospitable.  We are going to try it again tonight.
If they keep this up it will definitely be our new go to place!"}
{"text":"I'm torn...  you may want to sit for this one...  My wife and I have been to this place 3 times in the past month and that's because the wings are good.  They have a nice smokey flavour that you don't get at most places and you get good portions.   That being said.. they've been different each time we've gone.  The first time they seemed more smoked.. I don't know.  They were soft and juicy and seemed like they were cooked by a chef and were timed perfectly in the oven (or whatever they use).  The second time they were more like other places.. they were crispy like they were just dunked in a deep fryer for X amount of minutes and put on a plate.  They were still good but they seemed more generic.  The third time they were somewhere in between.   So based on the wings I'd suggest going to Mackenzie's.

Ok now here is the hard part.  The service is terrible.   2 of the 3 times the wait staff just disappeared.  They didn't bring us re-fills, didn't ask us how the meal was etc.  The 3rd time the staff was ok but just unenthusiastic and bland.    Speaking of bland...  if you are a designated driver you may want to avoid this place.  All 3 times we were there the pop was flat.  My wife had a water and I had a 7up and you couldn't tell which was which.   Each time we went I had a different pop and they were all flat. 

If this place to tighten things up with the staff and fix the pop machines this place would be great."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Mackenzie Pub after a terrible experience at a nearby establishment where we were lied to and totally ignored for 35 minutes. They obviously didn't want us there.

Walking into Mackenzie Pub was such a contrast. We were greeted with a smile from a very friendly server who invited us to choose any table and she'll follow us with menus. We chose a table on the patio since it was a nice evening.

We enjoyed our meal and had some drinks. We had the curried lamb and fish & chips, beer, wine, and Caesar. The food portions are very generous and tasty.

At the end of our meal, one of the owners, Raj, wandered over to say hello. He recognized me from my previous visit, over eight months ago! We had a nice conversation. I Love the personal touch. These guys know how to treat customers and their staff. I will gladly support businesses like this.

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"When you can't get in to the Portly Piper you will be tempted to go here. It's literally 'Ok'.  

Service is blah. Wings are ok. Beer is beer. 

But if your competitor is right across the street you should at least try for better than ok. 

So if you are faced with a 20 minute wait at Portly or thinking about trying this place out...we've done the work for you. Stay in that lineup."}
{"text":"Just happened to walk in here one day to try it out and boy was i glad i did!
It is a large space with multiple big screen tvs, great ambience
I ordered the nachos and some spicy wings and it was amazing! 
Service 8/10
Food 10/10"}
{"text":"Awesome time here, started off with a couple beers and then we headed on over to the platter. Oh boy was that good ! I Recommend bringing friends here or a special partner haha more of an adult feel, definitely check it out. #goodtime"}
