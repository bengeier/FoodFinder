{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful dinner at Trios this evening. Many thanks to head chef Ryan McCall for a wonderful meal. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My go to place.  Always have a great meal and great service. Sit at the bar and get to know the bartenders and locals.  If they would only yell my name when I arrive, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Trio is our girls' night out spot.  Jim. the bartender, makes the best cosmo in Charlotte.  He is not normally there on Mondays or Tuesdays though.  They currently have chicken piccata on the August specials menu and it is excellent.  The food quality and quantity is consistent week after week."}
{"text":"When we first got in, there was nobody at the hostess station. Once we were sat down, our waiter stopped at another table and the gentleman complained about how fishy his dish was and he didn't want it.   I ordered the lasagna and my wife had the filet mignon. My lasagna tasted OK but the whole thing was crispy on the outside like it had been made earlier and once ordered, was put under a broiler. My wife's steak was very bland, tender, but not flavorful at all. The waiter asked how her steak was and she replied, \"it's OK.\" He said, \"OK? Just OK?\" Trying to drag it out of her, so she told him that it was bland. He apologized and asked if she wanted him to take it back. She said no, we got our check, and left. My lasagna was a $7 meal at best. My wife said her's was priced decently but had no flavor."}
{"text":"Why have I not been in years?? NO idea!! FABULOUS food, appropriate pricing, and wonderful staff. Attentive, efficient, friendly,.... what more do you want.???  If it's been a while since you've been here or have never been, you won't go wrong by stopping in.  Enjoy a great meal and beverage. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Trio for years. I get take out about once a week. The menu is a little small, but there is something for everyone. From the soups and salads to the sandwiches and pizzas, everything is top notch. They have daily drink specials and even a specials menu that changes month to month.   While the food is spectacular, the staff is really what sells this place. Everyone is super friendly and they genuinely care about their customers.   Proud to be a regular at this establishment.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The service is very good and I am always greeted by the Manager when dining at Trio.  The MULLIGATAWNY Soup is  fabulous, thick with chicken chunks, carrot and potato in a creamy, lightly seasoned  curry base.  It is their Signature Soup!   GRILLED LEMON PEPPER SALMON with creamed cauliflower and roasted asparagus is my favorite meal. Trio is very good about taking substitutions to suit your dietary needs. The salads are fresh and colorful, with wonderful dressings to choose from. There is outdoor seating, booth seating, open area table seating and a room for large groups to reserve.  Individual Pizzas from the Stone Oven are fresh and you can watch from a seating bar in front of the oven. We like their Meatloaf dinner with 2 sides that can be switched if you prefer another choice. The front of the menu always has Specials of the season. So when it was Lobster season I tried their Lobster Salad with asparagus - it was Huge! and delicious! Almond Basket with Trio Mocha Ice Cream is another favorite dessert. There are lots of healthy fresh options at Trio, combined with a very friendly Staff, makes this my favorite Charlotte restaurant!  All restaurants have an occasional error when they are serving at peak times. My advise to customers that have an unhappy experience at Any restaurant is to speak up and ask for a manager to help you out. Everyone makes mistakes  now and then --- and I know that at Trio, they bend over backward to Make It Right! This is our favorite restaurant as they have been consistently superior for 20 years."}
{"text":"Best Reuben sandwich I have had in the Carolinas! Closest one to my favorite one at Carnegie Deli in NYC."}
{"text":"Spinach salad with warm bacon dressing was excellent along with the pizza.  Will definitely be going back again.  Restaurant is spacious and staff is great."}
{"text":"What makes this place more than anything else is the service very lovely staff and management. The food is generally good but I come back for the people."}
{"text":"The only time I have ever had a Caesar Salad that had absolutely no taste. Later in the evening became ill."}
{"text":"Came for the first time and will defiantly will be back!! BEST LIT in town! He recommended the chicken pot pie and it was MOUTH WATERING!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm with Jose V.: wish i'd caught her name, but she never told me...  I like trios and have been going fairly consistently since i moved closer a couple years ago.  I went back in the 90's and little has changed (that's a good thing bc the food is very good, prices are reasonable, etc) This last time was hampered by a server who seriously refused to even acknowledge half of our table.  One person in our party Never interacted with our server.  He kept having to flag down someone passing by for a drink order, dinner order, and 1 refill of tea...It was almost comical. I ordered dessert and she didn't even bother to look to see if he wanted anything, just took the order and ran.    It's funny bc we go out to eat everywhere and we are always treated well and are the easiest going group ever.  We have both been in the service industry for over 10 yrs and we make it a point to be nice/easy/friendly to everyone when we go out, so this was just a complete shock.    Still, it's a shame when a good place is held back by bad service."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant I tend to eat at solely with my parents.  That's not really a bad thing; it's just not typically a place I would seek out on my own.  Trio certainly has a few things going for it.  First, it's fairly large, and even with groups of five or six, I've never had to wait for a table.  Second, even though the decor is decidedly dated, I kind of love it... the interior is decorated primarily in teal, which is great, and the whole dining room has a light, airy feeling about it.  As for the food, I've had their pizzas and pastas and maybe a salad or two, and I've never had a bad meal.  Granted, my mind has never been blown either, but I can at least appreciate a place that has more than one or two options that aren't loaded up with beef.  Let's put it this way: I don't know that I would pay for this food myself, but it's a perfectly adequate place to be taken out to dinner."}
{"text":"Walked into Trio tonight and the restaurant was crazy busy in the middle of Charlotte's Queen's Feast week. To the rescue were two of Trio's favorite bartenders who welcomed me to the one of a kind bar area for Charlotte. Yummy low carb Turkey Burger, some nice wine to go with,  and exceptional service. These people know how to make you feel welcome. Cindy and Cacee are such an asset and I am always happy to return to such a friendly place where \"everyone knows your name\"...Be back soon!"}
{"text":"I would like to highly recommend Dave for catering for TRIO in the Charlotte area. As a Pharmaceutical Sales rep, I must provide good food and servive to my customers and in using TRIO I have never been let down, rather the presentation and foods have exceeded my expectations. Whether you need a gourmet breakfast or lunch, TRiO is my go to."}
{"text":"Trio is a staple venue that was the sister restaurant to Charley's in Cotswold. Pretty consistent food items ranging from brick oven pizza, salads, sandwiches and more dinner driven items. (on a side note, the Cobb Salad with its \"killer dressing\" is the BEST in town!!! The warm rolls they offer are great! The place is more for the older crowd (+55) so it's not a lively place that needs a decor overhaul."}
{"text":"Really enjoy sunday brunch.  had lobster here on my birthday once too and it was good"}
{"text":"We went here because we had received a gift card from a friend.  Great food, nice atmosphere, attentive work staff, and reasonable prices.  We would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Meh... Owner needs to update this place. Update everything please. If you are going to have carpet in a restaurant then keep it clean.  Risotto with scallops - should have been called risotto soup with scallops. Risotto was not cooked properly and was sooooo soupy not creamy as advertised. Scallops were grilled great.  Shrimp and grits - were average. More grits would have been nice. I am used to a serving of grits with shrimp and sauce on top. Was separate. Dish was decent but a lil on the meh side. Creme brulee was great. Nice touch with the banana bread and caramel and strawberry puree.  Don't think we will be back again. Better choices close by."}
{"text":"When we go out to eat, it's not usually to find a new restaurant. We want a place that tried and true, where our butts fit comfortably in the booth, and the food rests comfortably on our stomachs.  Trio is where we go on those occasions. The cooking is superb, the staff are friendly and helpful. Whether I order a drink and read a book for an hour, or come with friends and dine sumptuously, I know I'll never feel rushed and will enjoy my visit.   Try the wood-fired pizza! Dee-lish!"}
{"text":"this place is solid,  you will never feel ripped off, ever."}
{"text":"I don't understand the average of only 3 stars for Trio. We've eaten there perhaps 25 times, at least, and have never gotten a bad meal. The interior is nicely done, sitting outside has nice privacy in spite of its close proximity to 51. They have several unique standards we really enjoy, plus monthly specials. The pizza is very good (not NY style), and the service has always been prompt and friendly. It's one of our favorite places to have a relaxing dinner. I recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and well-cooked meal."}
{"text":"I had a brunch at my home catered by Trio this past weekend! Not only was the customer service excellent (with less than a weeks notice by the way) but the presentation and quality of the the food was amazing! I was so nervous (as I had not eaten at Trio previously and didn't know the quality of their food) but they pleasantly surprised me! There was plenty of food for all 25 of my guests! You can't beat the price of a brunch done by Trio. My menu included: Grits, bacon, eggs, and a beautiful fruit tray with pineapple, melon, strawberries, and cantaloupe. It was great! My guests commented on how tasty everything was. They even supplied, cups, cutlery, and plastic plates. Everything looked perfect! I was VERY pleased! Thank you Trio for making my brunch so seamless and easy for me. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The scallop appetizer & French onion soup again were great. All four of us were very happy with our dinners, ribs, chicken and dumplings, tortellini and fish and chips. I can't wait to come back next year!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with a nice and clean atmosphere! I really enjoyed my meal. My boyfriend said the steak there was the best he's ever had!"}
{"text":"Trio's Restaurant is a family favorite for us!  Their signature French onion soup is second to none, and is covered with a puff-pastry topped with cheese. It's a must-have if you feel the beginnings of a cold coming on, or for me, even on the hottest of summer days. The Trio sampler salad is another favorite, as is their shrimp and grits, also, our kids have always liked their pizza."}
{"text":"The food at Trio was ok. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't stellar. Same for the service, it wasn't bad but it did leave us wishing for better. We are not opposed to trying this place again, but we won't be regular customers."}
{"text":"Early bird special. The atmosphere is quite amusing. It reminds me of a Ryan's, California Dreaming mixed with a crowd coming back from church for the early dinner special. An older crowd!   The food was really good and the staff was really friendly. My crispy chicken sweet pepper sandwich was quite good and did not feel heavy. The friend were not crispy enough for my liking but they aren't good for you anyway."}
{"text":"I was here recently for a bridesmaid luncheon. We had an AMAZING time. Our service was outstanding. Not only did they take such good care of us, they went out of their way to make sure all 26 guest were treated like royalty.   Now, I can only speak for myself but the food was amazing. I had the Greek veggie pita and it was utterly delicious. You can add a protein. However, I opted for all veggies. Most of my table got some sort of a salmon salad and it looked soooo good. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot. I love sitting up at the bar and grabbing lunch or dinner. Jim and company are the best!"}
{"text":"This actually turned out to be a pretty good place for a girls brunch!   Their brunch menu isn't that extensive but the prices are just right! I went with the shrimp and grits which comes with collard greens...yep, I said collards!!!   The shrimp were seasoned very well and not overcooked at all! The grits had a creamy texture...not like what I expected but very delicious. And those collard greens were on point!!! So good that one of my girlfriends ordered a side to take home!   I also enjoyed a slice of the chocolate silk pie. I'd definitely hit this place up for brunch again!"}
{"text":"What a gem. We came into town for a trip to Carowinds the next day. We found this place on yelp. This is what I love about yelp. We would have never found this place or given it a chance. Great pizza and everything we had was fantastic. Great service and great food. Well done."}
{"text":"I prefer this place for breakfast / brunch. The food is very \"fatty\" which is not my preference on a typical day. However on a sunday morning its divine.  Very large restaurant so plenty of seating."}
{"text":"We've been going to Trio since it opened.  Eating there,especially on New Year's Eve, has become a family tradition.  Special thanks to Greg who always treats us and our guests with extra care and attention. The food and the staff have always been the highest quality and professional. We expect to celebrate many more special occasions at Trio."}
{"text":"Mediocre food for the $$$ price but great atmosphere and service.  I had the filet because I was feeling picky about the amount of dairy in the other items.  But the steak wasn't nearly as good as anything I can cook at home.    Drinks and desserts however were well worth it.  I would come back to socialize rather than enjoy the cuisine."}
{"text":"Trio's ALWAYS has a variety of tasty and unique dishes! Great quality food! Could improve on their drink menu :)"}
{"text":"I'm posting an updated review since I've been back to Trio many times since my last visit. The service has been spectacular and the food is still delicious. I love the Mediterranean Shrimp and Scallops dish. The scallops are perfectly cooked every time! Thank you Trio for being my favorite local restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came here after passing this for so many years and not giving it a try I read some review on Yell and decided to go ahead.  I went during brunch time and the waitress was hidden everytime we needed her. Talking to other waitresses. Mind you, the place had probably four tables.  I got the turkey and Swiss croissant and a fruit cup if I remember correctly. The croissant was stale and hard to chew the only thing that made is easier to swallow was getting extra mayo on the side. The fruit wasn't ripe and over all the experience was just bad. I am sure I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Never ever had a single bad meal here! Everything I've ever eaten is spectacular! Just wish the clientel was a bit younger! Kim is a great server. Ask for her!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best restaurants in the charlotte area.....I have been going back there since they opened in 1992....have tried a lot of stuff on the menu and it is always superb... The buttermilk fried chicken breast with stone ground grits and collards is my favorite brunch item. Love the Mediterranean shrimp and scallops as well. They also have very good pizza. You will not regret eating at Trio!"}
{"text":"Today's lunch was great like always. Chk Gordon blue is fantastic. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been here for the brunch and also dinner and every time the staff goes out of their way to meet your expectations. They have great food and even better desserts:) I recommend this for any occasion."}
{"text":"PARSNIPS FOR DESSERT? ABSOLUTELY.  TRIO TREMONT LIVES UP TO ITS PROMISE FOR INNOVATIVE AMERICAN FINE DINING   Let's start with last things first.  We enjoyed everything we ate at the new Trio Tremont restaurant, but the parsnip tiramisu not only was an outstanding dessert, but represents the creativity and risk-taking around which Anthony Scolaro continues to build a well-deserved, positive reputation as an Executive Chef.   111 Bistro, the best restaurant in the Medina, Ohio-area for the past four years, is the continuously excellent result of imaginative culinary skills provided by Chef Scolaro, and the management acumen of his business partner: Meghan Pender. Trio Tremont, scheduled to officially open on June 21, 2018 (and now holding \"soft openings\") is the second restaurant owned and operated by Anthony and Meghan.  Trio Tremont is located at 2661 W. 14th St., Cleveland, Ohio 44113. Phone: 216-952-7035. https://www.facebook.com/TrioTremont/  You owe it to yourselves to try it out.  We have always appreciated that Chef Scolaro is willing to experiment with combinations of tastes that at first glance may seem unusual, but when prepared, provide exceptional balance and ultimate satisfaction. We value the fact that he does not default to what is commercially easy or \"sure to please.\" That is the sign of a chef who is dedicated to the art of food, and not simply to the demands of selling popular but undistinguished dishes. Additionally, Chef Scolaro has consistently been a supporter of \"buying locally.\" Not only does he support local farmers and other providers, but goes out of his way to showcase Ohio food products in innovative and memorable ways. It is also worth noting that he is a vocal advocate for all restaurants in the Medina area. Rather than being harshly competitive, his progressive philosophy is that: \"the more restaurants in the area, the better for those to whom good food is important.\"  We were pleased that the high quality represented by 111 Bistro has translated to Trio Tremont where the menu is even more expressive. A visual copy of all selections is posted with this overview. From this menu we chose one entree: walleye; together with small plates of bread with honeycomb and stracciatella --- carrots with sunflower romesco and curry yogurt --- favas with beluga lentils, avocado, and sheep's ricotta --- corn/jicama salad --- and rabbit rillets with fig, apricot, and pickled vegetables. All were thoroughly excellent. The corn and jicama salad, prepared with lime vinaigrette, avocado puree, cilantro and mint, was my personal favorite because of the melded combinations of tart, sweet, and earthy flavors.  And then there was the parsnip tiramisu. Lovers of root vegetables know the parsnip to be sweet, but turning it into a tiramisu for dessert requires talent --- and nerve. It works. Wonderfully.  The ambiance at Trio Tremont is old-school European combined with contemporary minimalism. The blend of black, white and grays, creates an open, clean sense of comfort. Our young server, Lewis, was earnest, informed, responsive and interactive. In four years of enjoying 111 Bistro and now Trio Tremont, we have not had a server who was less than professional but also very personable. This is yet another example of quality so critical to a gratifying dining experience.  Trio Tremont is easy to find. More importantly, Trio Tremont is easy to enjoy. See and taste for yourselves."}
{"text":"I took my mom to dinner there to try it out and I left extremely disappointed in the service. I'm fine waiting 10-15 for a table but waiting an additional 15-20 for a waiter to notice us is frustrating to say the least, especially on an empty stomach. After a few failed attempts to get someone's attention we decided to leave and go across the street to chili's where we were really taken care of. Bummed I didn't eat at Trio but for me good service is a big deal when I go out to eat."}
{"text":"We eat at trio nearly twice a week. The menu has various different items and everything is good. I love the homemade chicken fingers and their brick oven pizzas are to die for. Trio is also very inexpensive for the quality of food that you get. Most dishes are under 12.00. The service is good as well."}
{"text":"Service and food couldn't be better ! Everything was so delicious and services was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant.  We have never had bad food or service. Prices are great & food is amazing.  We have eaten from the menu and the monthly specials, never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  We have been going to Trio since it opened and getting take out as well.  Got take out tonight and was disappointed.  Got the Cobb Salad and it was about half the size it used to be.  Maybe an ounce of chicken, a quarter of boiled egg and two little slices of avocado and not even enough dressing to cover the little salad.  Got the Chicken Picatta and the Chicken Breast were tiny.  Where do they get the baby chicks.  The rolls were like rocks, I guess left over from lunch.  All in all, disappointed.  I expected more as we used to get in the past.  And the prices keep going up which is OK if quality and volume remains the same.  Thanks"}
{"text":"This is one of my grandmother's go-to lunch restaurants, and I can see why.  The service here was great, and the waitress and manager came over to meet us since they know my grandmother so well.    They have a lot of specials and I got the roast beef sliders.  These were good although I saw their pizza on the way out and got food envy.  Definitely want to try that next time!  The menu is huge with lots to choose from.  The ice cream in the almond bowl was difficult to eat, but the perfect way to end the meal.    We'll be back next time we visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I think I have woosah'ed enough over the past few days that I can write a relatively (that's subjective) coherent review of this place.  I don't think I have been to Trio since it first opened many years ago (mid 90's?).  From my memory, it is still decorated pretty much the same based on the low benches at the pizza bar that are teal.  But that's fine - as long as the seats are comfy, I don't care what color they are.  I was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth. Most of the other diners were 50+, again, nothing wrong with that, but on a Monday evening, it was an older crowd.  My waitress was friendly enough but I was waiting on her quite a bit.  I was afraid to drink all of my water, as I didn't think I would be getting a refill.  I was not a fan of the service, I was in there for over an hour and all I ordered was a sandwich and a piece of pie.  But slowness isn't the worst of the waitress traits (I will get to that...)  The food: Roasted Beef Tenderloin sandwich with fries ($10) - (pictured) The first bite was delicious with a bite of soft bread, grilled onions, crispy onions, pepper jack cheese, herbed mayo and tender, well-flavored beef.  The second bite was stringy steak.  The third bite the meat was a little tougher.  Overall it wasn't a bad sandwich at all.  Pretty well balanced, although maybe a little spicier than I would have liked for a tenderloin sandwich.  The fries were fine, standard fries, nothing special, and served with a tiny cup of ketchup that was enough for exactly half of the fries.  Had I seen my waitress before I was almost done eating, I would have asked for more.  3/5 Chocolate Silk Pie ($4) - The description said it was a creamy white and dark chocolate mousse on Oreo cookie crust.  Drizzled with chocolate and I think raspberry sauce, along with some fresh strawberry slices scattered about, it was mostly frozen.  It reminded me of a Carvel ice cream cake.  It wasn't bad, well-presented, but wasn't what I was expecting. 2.5/5  Nothing was bad, but nothing was spectacular, however everything seemed to be reasonably priced and included crab cakes and scallops, which my mother loves, so I would have made a return trip toting her along.  Until...  I was seated just on the other side of the pizza bar and heard a waitress tell an offensive joke to the pizza chef.  I have a mouth like a sailor, and I am pretty hard to offend, but her \"joke\" turned my stomach.  And this was not a teenager, this was a girl who was easily in her mid to late 20's and should have more class and better home training than to repeat something so tasteless - it wasn't funny, it was ignorant, but when you are on company time it is a negative reflection of not only you, but your employer.  If you are going to act like trash, at least lower your voice or do it off of the floor.  I asked to speak to the manager, who did apologize and acted as if she would at least speak to the woman.  I was disgusted.    Never again."}
{"text":"A high three stars for Trio.    Nice bar, large dining areas and great menu with lots of choices and the entres are artfully done.  Service was excellent and children are catered to nicely.   Plenty of room for wheelchairs.   Standard meals which one would expect in local restaurants, but a few different items that were quite good.  The meatloaf was excellent, esp as the mashed potatos were real, not dehydrated or from a box.  If you had a birthday to celebrate, a large family occasion or wanted a quiet, yet well-lighted place to talk, Trio would easily and comfortably accommodate you."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get lunch... Food was good, had the Great Chicken. The dipping sauce that came with it was very tasteful as well.   The only thing that bothered me was the waitress, I am not easy to displeased BUT when you decide to chat with friends for more than a \"usual catch up\" that is just WRONG!  I came in to this establishment ready to eat and was displeased with having to wait. Even though my food was good the service knocked it down a star...  Proceed with caution... Wish I caught a name."}
{"text":"Ok lets talk about charlotte staples.   Trios, the sister restaurant of Charlies (not O'charlies you twit, Charlies at Southpark then Cotswold).    My personal favorites are the french onion soup, Burgers, and of course the club sandwich.      Staff is great and on point,  i have never had a bad experience here and let me tell you a little secret,  the ice tea, french onion soup and club sandwich are the magic cure for a hangover!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Food was great, our waitress was very helpful and nice.  Would recommend the wood fired penne pasta and the lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is one of those situations in which it's impossible to base a review entirely on the quality of the food. If I were to review the food alone, it would be 4 stars. What they do, they do quite well. The pizza is good and the brunch is a bit of a diamond in the rough. But, the condition of the main dining room simply cannot be glossed over and the 3 stars I am giving Trio might be too generous in this context. The decor is \"Early 90s Dentist Office\", but that's not the problem. The issue is the carpet, which might need to be carbon dated if we'd like to know its real age. The mildewy, moldy smell coming from it permeates the restaurant and is extremely unpleasant. This place needs some serious investment if it is to be anything but take out only."}
{"text":"Very disappointed , I had the salmon it was good but can they spear it . The cauliflower was good but there spinach all I tasted was vinegar . My brother had the pasta with the lobster he gave me a peace it was over cooked and had no flavor . After we left we were both still hungry ."}
{"text":"This was a fun treat. I was invited here by a colleague who works in this area. I was in town on business, and we enjoyed a lunch there.  They serve a variety of artisanal creations based on basic American foods.  For example, they added a nice kick of tarragon to my tuna sandwich (which the graciously switched to a wrap at my request).  It was a very hot day, or I would have been tempted to try the soups. Several people had them and they smelled delicious, but I simply couldn't manage with 90+ degree weather afoot.    They also served some salads to our table, which looked delightful, and the server was very thoughtful about how he presented the options and the finished food upon arrival.    I was mostly impressed that a man who was walking around cleaning tables, and being generally polite, was later identified by my lunch-mate as the owner of the restaurant.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For a place that has been open for one week Trio is great. Friendly staff, reasonable wine list  and delicious food.  The Two Way Duck and the Agnolotti were outstanding, accompanied by sauces that took time and effort to create. We appreciate the moderate portion sizes and prices. We look forward to working our way through the menu. A fabulous addition to Tremont!"}
{"text":"Good food, really nice service but totally dated atmosphere! This place has so much potential - just need a little investment in the building itself!"}
{"text":"Just had one of the June specials- ancho ribs. They were great , succulent and tasty. They were also very meaty I had trouble finishing the whole rack !"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this restaurant. My husband and I just moved from Orange County CA which is the Mecca for foodies. This is definitely a new favorite for us. We had the calamari to start and for the entrees we chose the smoked chicken penne pasta and filet mignon. Everything was incredible (like lick the plate kind of good). Since it was Monday they had a special that if you spent over $30 as a couple you get a free dessert. I love desserts, so I was very excited! We got the baked Alaska and let me tell you.... Insanely decadent it was delicious. And to top it off Matt, our server, was so nice and went above and beyond to make our meal one to remember. We will definitely be back! Thanks Trio for an incredible dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always enjoy coming here. Don't let the building fool you. While it feels like you're stepping back to the 90s, the service is excellent. And it's quiet enough and tables are spaced out enough to where you can have a conversation.   I had the Mediterranean shrimp and scallops with pesto orzo. While the shrimp were tasty, the flavor of the orzo was the star. It was creamy and savory with just the right amount of sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Oh and the food comes out fast.  Dessert is my favorite. The mocha pecan ice cream is amazing and this is the only restaurant that serves it. We tried to get a server to track it down for us, but It's a special flavor made only for Trio. This time I had it in the almond basket which was beautiful in presentation, but I enjoy it more on a brownie.   This is a good place for a relaxing dinner with great service."}
{"text":"We have lived here almost 4 years and can't believe we just found this gem around the corner from our house.  Our waitress Stacy was great, obviously really proud to work at this long standing restaurant that makes a lot of their food right there.  I knocked off one star because they did not have any vegan dinner dishes besides salads that could be modified so I ordered the vegetarian pizza.  It was delicious.  My husband enjoyed his seafood dish too.  We will be back one day soon for dessert!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Oven wasn't working so no pizzas available. Had French onion soup. Not enough cheese and I think Campbell's soup is better. Over priced for average, below average food. Maybe this is what's normal in Ballantyne but not what I'm used to. Not impressed. Going to leave and hit up McDonalds. Don't feel like spending another $12 on something just ok"}
{"text":"Trios is always our go to place when we want a good meal, and a good ambience.   First off all of the servers are extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager usually stops by every table to make sure the experience was great. If you get a salad try their killer dressing. As an entree my absolute favorite is the sea bass at around $16 it is a great value and is an amazing meal!   I really have never had a bad meal at trios but believe me if something is not up to your standards and you let the server know they will go above and beyond to make you happy.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Good service, clean facility, and very consistent.. Highly recommended establishment.."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week after being told my several people not to. The atmosphere is weird. A lot of blue hairs and older people. We were by far the youngest table. Which is A-OK with me, I make my own fun.  Had a delicious fillet with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. The dessert which was a brownie sundae type thing was yummy! Not to huge of a portion so I could eat it myself :)  The cocktails were good and different not something I would expect from this place. The waitress was good. I don't think this place is bad at all and wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"Very good one note they said they only carry local beer on tap which is not a bad thing Had Sirloin beef sandwich with fresh fruit It was excellent! Fruit was very fresh and tasty I could have used a glass of water but wasn't asked Yes I could have asked for one but I think server should have asked me Been here several times and never been disappointed !!' Worth going back to"}
{"text":"We went here for Restaurant Week and it was yuck, just yuck. The salads were good, but the decor and the entrees are straight out of the 80's and everything was either overcooked or oversalted. Gordon Ramsay needs to come yank this place out of \"Kitchen Nightmare\" status."}
{"text":"Most new spots have a few bumps and hurdles along the way, not so with Trio.  Our grand opening dinner was spot on.  The service was great starting with the hostess who explained the menus pointing out some of her favorites.  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable on the menu and wines.  We started with small plates which were all unique and tasty.  Who would think a carrot dish would be on a menu?  I don't even like carrots-this dish was outstanding.  The scallops were so tasty with the miso puree and yuzu foam.  Also, the bread plate was a great combination.  For main dishes, our table had the walleye, agnolotti, and wagyu.  My son devoured the wagyu beef which was prepared perfectly.  The deconstructed potato salad was unique and tasty.  The agnolotti with braised lamb neck was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.  So tasty.  My husband had the walleye which was cooked perfectly with the nice crispy ham as a nice accent.  Anthony and Megan both visited to ensure we were pleased with everything.  We were extremely pleased with the dinner and service."}
{"text":"Trio catering is the best! Let me say if you have not tried their catering, you are missing out! Rarely do I do restaurant reviews, but this is a must.  I recently hosted a holiday brunch and took a chance with Trio catering as I had never been to the restaurant.  I ordered the breakfast options catering package and I have to say it was AMAZING!!  First, the process in working with the catering manager, Dave Robinson was very smooth!  He was very helpful in answering all of my questions in regards to the catering process at Trio and what I could expect; trust me, I had a lot of questions!   On the day of setup (which was a Sunday) he was very organized, brought all of the materials and showed up right on time!  In working with other caterers, I am not always so lucky, but this was great. Everything was amazing, but the quiche, French toast and potatoes were great!  The Trio catering packages is very reasonable price-wise and the food is so delicious!  I have to say I gave many referrals at the event and hope to make this an annual brunch event thanks to Trio and the delicious food and service!"}
{"text":"They have a wonderful brunch. Have wonderful monthly specials. A fun place to go lots of good food and lots of nice people."}
{"text":"A nice diner with your average dinner decor.  It was very crowded so I assumed it would be a good place to eat. I had the brunch pizza which was pretty decent.  Nothing to write hope about but good.  They brought out dishes off assortment muffins before your meal and wow.  These little lemon poppy seed warm muffins were great! I don't know if they were homemade or not but they tasted great!  Hopefully I will be able to get back here and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have no idea why Trio's isn't rated higher but it can't be the food. I have been coming here for 20 years and reviewing someplace poorly because of a bad joke you heard is very ignorant. I get the Three Cheese Tortellini, Mulligatawny soup YUM!, and the Almond basket for dessert but with cinnamon ice cream. I really don't know how you can go wrong, they have great chefs that cook a lot of things from scratch, get the specials they are worth it usually. Apple pear vinaigrette is a winner too."}
{"text":"Second time here, first time non-catering menu. My girlfriends and I went for brunch. I can say I was pleasantly surprised. I say pleasantly surprised for a couple of reasons. 1) The decor is very outdated. Going off of looks, this might not be your first choice. 2) Food at the shower I hosted a couple of months ago was tasty, but it just sandwiches and salad. So I was a little skeptical for brunch items.   I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and a Mimosa from the brunch menu. First, the Mimosa was a nice addition to the meal, but tasted more like Orange Juice. Now, my Shrimp and Grits were good, but the quantity was disappointing. My side items were Collard Greens and a Sausage Wrap of some sort. Most of my plate was Collard Greens. However, this was why the meal was a pleasant surprise, as the Collard Greens were seasoned excellently. I was just wanting more Shrimp and Grits.   Also, SN:  the brunch menu says assorted muffins and bread. Those were quite disappointing, as they were very small and tasted very similar to what I could get from a Sam's Club or Wal-Mart."}
{"text":"We had our wedding celebration at Trio last year & my 50th birthday celebration catered by Trio this year. Trio hit both out of the ballpark! Great food & even better service. It's also the cleanest & most organized food service establishment in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep going back to this place.  While talking to my wife about trying to find a home for a pit bull puppy, the manager told her to just have it put to sleep.  Nice customer service.  What a jerk."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was outdated and old. The food was cold. We had the onion soup which was tasty, but our main meal was sub par. The Ruben was underwhelming and the burger was dry. The wait staff was friendly and eager to serve. Unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"Trio is an excellent place for a casual weekday meal or a special weekend occasion. The atmosphere is relaxed but sophisticated, and the service is prompt and attentive. On Monday night, you can easily get a table. I had the shrimp and grits - very different from what I expected, but delicious - and the trio greens salad. The salad was large and full of fresh fruit and candied walnuts. Try the brownie with walnut ice cream for dessert, generous enough for three to share."}
{"text":"We had Five star service from Kim, thank you Kim! The food was tasty and arrived in a timely manner. I had lobster ravioli. Another guest had the rib-eye four stars! It was moist, well seasoned, sizable but a thin cut. The Cod sandwich was fresh and very flavorful. It's a spacious setting with a lot of natural lighting. The sweet tea was not too sweet and their dessert sizes were good portions."}
{"text":"No way will I be back any time soon. My husband and I went here for restaurant week and we were very disappointed with everything. I was able to make a reservation easily at the last minute and I was glad I we did. The line was endless and crowded.   We get seated and our waiter takes around 10 minutes for him to take our drink orders. Through dinner, he kept giving me my husband's drink, and his mine and our drinks were empty most of our dinner. We place our appetizer order in and ask if the baby's food can be brought out 1st. My husband orders the calamari and I ordered the lobster bisque. TWENTY FIVE MINUTES LATER (not exaggerating) we get the baby's food and our appetizers. The calamari was very good, but the lobster bisque could have used some cheese and salt. I wasn't all that impressed with it.  While we are eating our appetizers, our salads come. Both of us ordered the cesar salad and it was the worst salad I had in a while. The salad dressing was very heavy on the anchovies and had a nasty taste to it. The croutons were homemade, yet extremely stale and chewy (if that's possible). It was so nasty, we didn't finish our salads.  15 minutes after we FINISH our salads, the main course arrives on piping hot plates and placed IN FRONT of my infant daughter so she can burn herself. I ordered the Mediterranean seafood dish that had scallops, shrimp, lobster pieces, kalmata (sorry for the spelling) olive pieces, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, feta cheese, and risotto. I was very surprised to find out that my dish was actually really good. The flavors from the olives, the dressing that was put on it, and the seafood blended in really well. My husband ordered the filet minon medium rare, mashed potatoes, and zucchini medley. The filet minon was cooked medium with a very poor attempt of a holiendase sauce on top of the steak, it was tough to cut through, and the zucchini was not cooked all the way through. My husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it.  Dessert was a joke. I ordered crème brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream. My dessert was not cooked all the way through and the strawberries that was served with it were very sour. It also came with banana bread muffins, but I was so fed up with my meal at that point I didn't bother with them. My husband had a little better luck with his than I did. The ice cream and sauce on the bottom of the dessert were alright, but the \"basket\" had sesame seeds on it and it completely threw off the taste.   We get our bill and come to find out it's $81. I scan through the bill and come to find out my daughters kiddie drink was full price at $2.25, her meal was a full price meal instead of the kiddie price like we were told it was at $8 and her kiddie ice cream (that was 2 HUGE scoops of half melted ice cream) was $4.95. We bring this up to our waiter (which that was the fastest he moved the whole night) and he told us there was nothing he could do and shrugged it off. Since we got that response, it was no use in complaining about our meals at all since we were going to get a nose snubbed at.   In general, we had a terrible go at it and I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent Dining experience.  Whenever calamari is on menu for appetizer we try it.  We have tasted calamari from Maine to Hawaii and Trio has the best calamari we have ever tasted.  All dinners were excellent, beef tips sandwich, salmon, meatloaf and ribeye steak, and two desserts, baked Alaska and almond basket were outstanding.  Service was top notch, attentive though not rushed. I unfortunately don't remember the name of our server, but she did an excellent job.  Yes the decor was...different and most of the chairs have seen many-a-diner.  But the food in my stomach made up for the chair under my bottom."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I loved it.  The second time I went, we order 1/2 sandwich and soup.  We received a full sandwich and the soup was ice cold.  We were also charged for the regular sandwich and soup.   I've also tried take out with them and just wasn't happy with the tastes, so think I've given this place enough shots."}
{"text":"Trio has been in Charlotte ever since I can remember.  It is a place that the locals seem to love.   I've been here on an off in the past several years but only learning again to appreciate their food.    We started coming here for lunch for a change from the usual options.  The place gets busy so if you hit it around lunchtime, your best option may be to wait until after 12:45 when it clears out a little.    The menu is very diverse and includes pizza, salads, sandwiches and various entrees.  I typically order something healthy here and love, love, love their Southwestern Salmon salad. which comes with a salmon filet over a bed of romaine, jicama, corn, peppers and a couple of other ingredients with a spicy vinagrette dressing.  Very tasty.  Service is usually good here.  Host and Hostess are very friendly.  And the layout of the is restaurant is very unique.  There's a pizza counter in the back where you can sit and watch them make pizzas, there's a bar in the back.,  Everything is broken into about 3 cascading levels.  The lowest level is typically used for larger groups.   Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots.  One day I may have to check it out for dinner."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken and pancakes Mothers Day. The chicken was cooked just right and the sweet spicy sauce delicious. The pancake was very good. A great brunch."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Trio many times, starting when it opened many years ago!  Today we went in for another fabulous meal and our server, Casey, remembered what we usually ordered for lunch and dessert!   It had been quite  a while since we had been in and we were just amazed that she would remember us and what we liked!  Not only do we highly recommend Trio for lunch, dinner, and week end brunch, but we suggest asking for Casey if possible!   All of the servers are excellent, and have always been very helpful and efficient .  They have also added a wonderful outdoor room with high ceilings, sky lights, fans and screens - no rain or bugs to spoil a lovely meal in the fresh air!  Just another reason this is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here yesterday and I can honestly say it was one of the better experiences I've had at a restaurant in a while.  The server was attentive and friendly (which for some reason is getting rather rare!) and the food was very tasty!  The salmon was cooked to perfection, while my husband was pleased with his meatloaf, even though he wished there had been MORE of it.  We'll definitely go back sometime.  It's just too yummy to pass up!  Now, the cons.  They are so tiny I almost blush bringing them up.  But here they are, just the same:  The ambiance:  the restaurant hasn't been updated in quite some time, I'd wager since it was first built.  Where we sat there were signs of touch-up paint in places where the paint had peeled, but no complete renovation.  And the neon really has to go.  I felt like I was eating in a restaurant where I could expect Crockett or Tubbs to walk through the door at any moment!  Kind of weird!  Tiny touches, like the aioli on our crab cakes, were obviously phoned in.  It was basically just mayonnaise with a little more lemon juice mixed in.  But I'm a little picky where the finishing touches are concerned, so it might have just been me.  Other than those two little nit-picky items, I'd happily dine here again and again!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner one night and got sat right away. Interior is clean but a little outdated. I got the chicken fingers and pasta salad. Chicken fingers were crispy and piping hot. Fresh and juicy. Ranch was good. Pasta salad was pretty good too. Decent prices."}
{"text":"I won't lie, what they lack in a modern decor is undoubtedly made up for in the food and service!! I opted to forego the wine and start with the onion soup--WOW! The crust on top was delicious & the soup wasn't very salty.  I ordered the pecan crusted trout and about fell over it was so good. I'm a southern girl who loves her own mashed sweet potatoes but I think they have me beat. I figured I might as well wrap up this time warp dream come true with a baked Alaska and was in heaven. Sadie was a pleasure to work with and was honest about her recommendations which I greatly appreciated.  If you're ever near Trio's- give them a try. Just follow the squiggly neon light to an amazing meal."}
{"text":"I love Trios we go often an it's been a great place to always have my birthday party. They have brick oven pizza that is perfect for one. Love the sweet potato home made chips with blue cheese. Service is always perfect an food delish. They have a house dressing you must try Killer Dressing yes that's it's name . I can't explain its a light creamy dressing they make great on their salads. My dad loves their meat loaf, a great place for brunch as well. Their deserts are to die for my favorite when they have it is baked Alaska so good an they have an almond basket it's a basket made out of crushed almonds an molded into a basket an served with a coffee ice cream inside with fresh berries. It's a must have especially for your bday. I will always go back great hidden treasure in Pineville .  Update; I have to say the past 3 times Ive been my order has been wrong an we have had a server that attends to her regulars not so much her other tables. There rolls are all the sudden an issue . Ive been going to Trios for years never an issue.  When you order a salad Ive always gotten a roll or Ive asked a server an they bring me one with the whipped butter.  Ive asked at one of my visit an the server gave me some speech they dont give them to everyone blah blah . She finally brought us all one . I was there this week an the server I had several months ago we had her again so my order was wrong again an my friends salad which is all she got barely had any dressing.  Our server who was also the bartender was waiting on her  regulars didn't come back another server or mgr came over finally. Again I asked for a roll an because I had pizza an half salad it doesn't come with it SMH its gonna be some time before I go back . Its not MCdonalds or BK  not cheap so I expect good service an my order right.  If rolls are expensive for them than they need to start stating that on their menu.  I can go right up the road to metro diner service is awesome an food never an issue there if Im asking for something.  Good luck trios"}
{"text":"We wanted to give this new offering a try, so we checked them out recently for drinks and dessert. The cocktails were great- smooth and well balanced, but not weak. We chose the meringue to share for dessert and loved the combo of flavors chosen. Presentation was beautiful and the service was spot on. I hope to be back soon to explore the full menu! Was also glad to learn they have happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Trio is an often overlooked gem in South Charlotte. We are guilty of passing by and every time we do choose to stop, we remember just how tasty it is - they're reliable for comfort foods, but offer many great low carb options too - for not a lot of money. It's good for kids and the desserts are beyond delicious (and totally shareable sizes). The almond basket dessert is so good I can't eat it slowly in fear that my share-mates will get all the good parts!!! We love trio and are happy it's in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and food while I was there. The brunch menu was nicely laid out. Was there with some Ladies for brunch. Loved it. The service was nice as well."}
{"text":"We catered a retirement luncheon with Trio just today and it was a disaster!  The delivery was for 25 people (an array of pastas and salad, drinks)  they arrived with 8(eight) breadsticks, no drinks.  By the time the driver (Dan, the manager) arrived with breadstick and drinks everyone had eaten lunch.  I can't even begin to tell you how unimpressed I felt when I discussed this poor service with Dan (this individual who represented himself as management) and he responded  with \"people make mistakes\" and \"there's nothing I can do about that now\".   Yes, the  food was good but I now have plenty of breadsticks and drinks because it all arrived after lunch.  Oh, did I mention I already paid for this?  Dan, just in case you haven't learned this key management rule--unsatisfied customers don't come back.  If you want to stay in business you need to bring your 'A' game."}
{"text":"Trio is a nice, big restaurant that we patronize for some special occasions and during Queen's Feast. The decor makes me feel like I've stepped back into the 90s, but its comfortable and well-maintained so its actually pleasant.  As someone who hates sweet potatoes, I was dismayed during Queen's Feast (Jan 2018) when my filet mignon arrived with a massive mound of mashed/whipped sweet potatoes, until I tasted them. I wouldn't have thought to put a filet with sweet potatoes, but it worked extremely well. They are still the only sweet potatoes I like.   On another occasion, I had their lobster ravioli, which was good but a little too rich and had some shell in one of the raviolis.   Service is always good, and the waitstaff looks busy but does a great job."}
{"text":"I like the marinara sauce here! I was very impressed. The service is very good.  I have been here twice and enjoyed my food each time. I had the pasta special.  They have good bread and salad also. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and I like the atmosphere and style. Maybe it is a little 80'ish looking on the design, but who doesn't love a place where you are taken back Miami Vice and shoulder pads in your leather jacket.  The food is very good an I've tried a variety of things without being disappointed. Oven backed pizzas are good, shrimp and grits ok but I've had better. The baked Alaskan (I thought it was fish when my fiancé ordered it) is a wonderful dessert but only available certain times of the year."}
{"text":"I have lived in South Charlotte my entire life and just made it to Trio!!  Shame on me!  The food was amazing- our table enjoyed the tortillini, the lobster ravioli and a few of the pizzas.  All were a huge hit.  The service was good- if I had to guess, I would guess that many of the servers have been with this restaurant for a long time.  All of the staff were friendly with my 1 year old, even when part of his meal was on the floor. Huge selling point for me.  Halfway through the meal, we noticed the air vents in the ceiling.  They are disgusting and discolored- in serious need of being repainted."}
{"text":"Made reservations via open table for 1p Sunday via the restaurant queens feast tab via open tables website we are here for that meal but  we were told it's unavailable because of brunch !!  We are not the only people who feel they got a smoke and mirror deal...funny I could order all options via their Ala cart menu...never to return...hey should not not allowed us to book it at the it is not honored"}
{"text":"I've been going to Trios for the past 4-5 years. I go at least once a month. Everything I've ever tried was amazingly delicious. There was a turkey burger they I loved but it has been discontinued. I was bummed about that. This weekend we went and I tried a monthly special. I was extremely disappointed. It was chicken pot pie, it came out room so I asked them to heat it up, when it came back, I tried it and it honestly tasted and looked like a can of progressive chicken pot pie soup with canned chickens pieces and all. The puff pastry they put on top was good. The creme brûlée was okay when it's normally out of this world. The waitress was okay, she was better than the last one we had. I truly hope the next time I go, it's like the Trio's that it used to be and I want to keep going back."}
{"text":"Yummy! The food here is really good. The chicken with the chicken in and waffles has the perfect crunch. They also have excellent catered breakfast"}
{"text":"Would've been 5 but we unfortunately had a racially charged  incident that caused us to relocate to another location but the manager and staff responded quickly and took care of us for the otherwise fantastic experience. The food was delicious. Will definitely come back despite the initial incident"}
{"text":"The Restaurent was great! I had a slight problem with the manager because she was joking about how they run out of proper glasses for drinks and my party and I had the old glasses but everyone else had the right glasses on their special drink night. Long story:) But she redeem herself and made sure we left happy. Over beyond service, I had the best food and even got dessert. Will try again!"}
{"text":"I thought the place was nice. We went in for lunch. The portions are not super large but it all tasted good. I asked  for my ruin with no bread and they took care of it.  The staff seemed nice and friendly"}
{"text":"I usually don't go to new restaurants until they've been open for a while. In this case, since I'm familiar with Chef Anthony Scolaro's Medina restaurant, 111 Bistro, I decided to give it a try after being open for only 6 days. WOW, did we make the right choice. All of us had a fabulous meal and great service! Don't hesitate going to TRIO now. This little neighborhood GEM in Tremont will be popular in no time at all. So, you better get there before it becomes difficult to get a table. Way to ROCK IT OUT Anthony and Meghan!"}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints about this place. The food was absolutely amazing! I went with a group of friends and everyone got something different for dinner and dessert, and no problems with any of it. service was amazing also. The food and drinks were both very well priced, especially for the portion size and quality of the food. Best meal I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"This is a bit of an odd one because the ambiance and decor don't match the food that we had.  We went for Restaurant Week and the $30 prix fixe for 2 ended up at $95 with the addition of 2 beers and a glass of wine, plus tip.  The food was actually very good and the presentation was very good, too.  My steak wasn't high-end steakhouse caliber, yet it was a good piece of meat.  Portions were somewhat modest, but reasonable for a classy meal.    Now for the rest...  The main area, where we sat, has a very high (2-story) ceiling, with plenty of light.  Great, so far.  There is another eating area and a bar that have standard ceiling height.  There are two types of seating.  One is square tables, with white table clothes, and the other is padded benches with outdated mauve tables.  Very Denny-ish or like a local diner.  They benches were in great shape, but the tables were a little worn around the edges.  The table was stocked with a plain salt-and-pepper set and a plain sugar holder.  The floor was carpeted, which I only mention because, unless carpeting looks very clean, I view it as a breeding ground for bacteria.  Not that it was, just worries me.  Our main waiter was very good.  Professional and efficient.  The drink waitress seemed more appropriate for a country diner in appearance, demeanor, and dress.  The crowd was on the older side (not that there's anything wrong with that, plus I ain't a youngster), which may have been because of the early time we went.  That's about it.  If the seating area got a makeover, I'd say this place could be called a moderately high-end restaurant.  Then again, if I'd eaten one of the more down home choices, and/or paid just a bit less, it probably would have all come together for me.  I'd go back for a $30-40 meal, but if I'm paying $100, I'll be  going elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Trio for the first time last Saturday night.  The mixed reviews had me a bit apprehensive...but we were very pleasantly surprised with our experience.  We were seated very quickly and were greeted by Matt, our server.  We ordered wine and an appetizer...the Wood Fired Pesto Bread...which I never expected to be one of the best appetizers I have ever eaten.  Seriously...fantastic!  Next my husband ordered the Mediterranean Shrimp and Scallops which he described as \"so good I considered licking the plate\".  I had the Grilled Ribeye with roasted vegetable medley, whipped potatoes, and shallot herb butter.  Again, it was perfectly cooked, tender, and very flavorful.  We were offered dessert...but were so stuffed from the great meal we declined.  Matt was a wonderful server...funny, very attentive without hovering, and knowledgeable about the menu.  We look forward to our next trip to Trio and another fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Ordered the Irish spring roll. French onion soup was really good! Rebye was pretty good, but battered chicken fingers and fries are not as good as expected (you'd be better off with Chick Filet and Bojangles for sure). Great service and extensive desert menu. Will definitely come back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Big shout out to Trio for having a pet friendly porch. Not only were they accomdating, but I have to say the lovely staff went above and beyond to make us weary travelers (me and my pet) feel very welcome. Southern hospitality at its best! I am sadly already forgetting what I had but I know it was my standby soup and salad. I remember it was very good and the service fabulous."}
{"text":"I have liked trio since the mid nineties... I still do. Good food, fair prices, but the service needs to be addressed... My party was treated  with the bare minimum of service, even less if we actually needed something.  I would easily rate them higher if the service improved.  My friend refused to even order dessert or after dinner goodies just to get away from the service."}
