{"text":"I LOVE this nice little restaurant! It is only 20 mins walking distance away from our house, and they have many delicious vegan tapas (mezzas) for me to choose from. The owner was super nice to chat with while waiting for take-out. Also I adore their design, every table has a nice picture taken from Lebanon underneath glass. Oh, they also have an online take-out option, what more can one ask for :)"}
{"text":"The food is good but overpriced. We felt like the staff spent the night trying to up-sell us, and there was \"confusion\" when they came back to our table to offer a \"chef's special\" app instead of the one we ordered. We agreed but ended up receiving (and then having to pay for) both."}
{"text":"Cute little lebanese restaurant. I go there for the Mezzas, they are awesome. The fattoush salad is my favourite! They also offer sheesha now!"}
{"text":"Went by and saw that this place is now closed. It's transforming into a Japanese restaurant called Hi-Ne. Definitely excited to see what they will have on the menu. The new decor looks really good! No notice of when it's opening yet but it may be soon - looked pretty much complete."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place ever since it opened in Etobicoke. I'm going to give it a 4.5, as I haven't tried everything on the menu (most of it, but, not all of it!). Sorry to hear that Jason A had a bad experience, but, i can assure you, it's definitely worth trying (at least) once! 

It's a great place on the Queensway (right near Royal York), and offers indoor and outdoor dining (although the patio is right on the Queensway, so it may be a bit noisy!). The interior is very nice, and the place is exceptionally clean (passes the bathroom test too!).
I've been to this place about 5 times, and on my recent visit, I ordered the following:

Ap's - Baba Ghanouj/pita, and Olives/Pickles

Main - Char Grilled Shish Tawook (2 Skewers of tender grilled chicken breast)

Not only did it look amazing, but, everything tasted fantastic! I especially liked the toum garlic sauce that came with the skewers!!
In addition to excellent food, the server was very friendly, prompt and courteous (She's like that on every visit!).
The place is good for small groups (6-8 ppl), couples, families, etc..
If you like Lebanese/middle-eastern style food, I encourage you to try it!

I enjoy Mezza so much that I was a bit hesitant to share my experience on Yelp, for fear of it becoming crowded...but, I had to spread the word! Hopefully you will feel the same way!"}
{"text":"Don't let the cover of the book fool you...we picked up our order, so we were pleasantly surprised by the interior and truly enjoyed the meal, which was plentiful!!
We had the falafel meal, falafel sandwich (for the price it's amazing!), and humus...all are a must. 
The ppl were nice and courteous, he ensure that the order was complete by walking me through it, much appreciated. 
The parking can be a little difficult, but I'm sure you can figure it out."}
{"text":"LOVED, LOVED this restaurant from Entrance to Exit. Ooh my goodness gracious everything was SUPERB. The food was fresh,delicious, elegantly plated and the service was wonderful. Definitely going back to this cute little restaurant on The Queensway."}
{"text":"More like 4.5 
I don't understand why this restaurant is always empty every time I pass by it (and that is quite often). I would recommend to anyone to go to this restaurant and try the food because it is really good. It's such a shame that this restaurant is usually empty because it's really so good.  the waiters were super friendly when I went and explained anything we needed. The decor of the restaurant is nice and modern. It looks really nice inside. The food is authentic and tastes good. Sorry I've been saying the same thing but you've got to try it,"}
{"text":"The food is quite good, if you don't mind the surly service and some authentic middle eastern misogyny. Seriously, our server never addressed my wife once, even when she paid the bill. \"Sir, would you like something to drink?\" \"Sir, would you like some coffee or tea?\" The surliness of the service is something you'll have to see for yourself. It's not what was said, just how he said it. We will not be going back and I'm sure if they corrected their manners, the place wouldn't be empty for lunch."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant is very rude. I personally witnessed him discriminate against customers and refuse service based on physical appearance. It's despicable! 
The food isn't bad but not worth the unpleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fabulous falafel, wonderful hummus, and the spinach fatayer was amazing.

I saw Mezza as I was driving past, looking for somewhere to eat and decided to turn around and try it. I was not disappointed. The food was great and the service from Hannah was just right.

I ordered the hummus (nicely served, wonderfully flavourful), the olives and pickles, the artichoke, the falafel appetizer, and the spinach fatayer. The waitress made sure that I knew what I was doing when I ordered the whole artichoke; it was massively large and full of flavour. She highly recommended the spinach fatayer, and it was the highlight of the meal because I didn't know what to expect from it at all.

As a vegetarian, I'm a careful connoisseur of falafel, and I must say that Mezza's does not disappoint in the least. It is one of the top four falafel I've had in Toronto.

After dinner, I decided to try a Lebanese dessert, ashta. It was interesting; it's basically a clotted cream that Mezza serves with sliced banana, honey, and crushed pistachio. On the whole, I liked it a lot, but it's probably not something that I'd have every time.

One can't go into Mezza expecting the ambiance and pricing of a Lebanese lunch grill; this is a modern Lebanese restaurant with prices and quality to match. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Small place, but nicely decorated, classy style. Beef Shawarma was very good, Fatoosh salad also very good. Rice was not what I'm used to from Lebanese restaurants but was not bad. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Specialty: Lebanese
Menu items: Shmandar, Hummus, Falafel Appetizer, Beef Shawarma & Char Grilled Shish Tawook

Mezza is a cute, small restaurant tucked away in Etobicoke serving authentic Lebanese food made from fresh ingredients, derived from family recipes. The service at Mezza is impeccable and servers greet you and seat you upon arrival. The drinks order comes with an accompaniment of pickled vegetables to open up one's appetite, amuse-bouche style. When I visited, pickled carrots were awaiting us. In Lebanon the assortment of pickled vegetables as an appetizer are called shamndar.

The hummus is a home-made blend of chickpeas, garlic and creamy goodness that is spiced with paprika and drizzled with imported olive oil from Lebanon. Though quite comparable in taste to the Jerusalem-style hummus from Me Va Me, I found Mezza's a bit too grainy.

The falafel appetizer at Mezza is one of my favourite dishes. Lightly fried patties of chickpeas, broad beans, parsley, garlic, onion, coriander, and spices are served fresh with tahini dipping sauce on the side. The falafel is light and crispy and bursting with nutty freshness; a whole world away from the typical American servings from fast food joints.

On the entree front, Mezza dazzles crowds with their Char Grilled Shish Tawook, basically tender pieces of chicken breast served on a skewer, grilled to perfection and lightly seasoned. The dish is accompanied with a pile of crispy-golden french fries and leafy greens.

The Beef Shawarma, another great entree execution at Mezza, comes served with lean pieces of marinated beef, sprinkled with parsley; and on the side, a rice pilaf mixed with green peas and a greens salad with tahini dressing. The dish is simple, yet packed with a ton of flavour.

Overall, my experience at Mezza Lebanese Kitchen was one to remember with a great offering of authentic, home-made dishes that were beautifully plated.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and subtle and delicious. Service is truly \"service\"... very descriptive about the food and helpful with our selections."}
{"text":"The food is full of flavour...a bit too much flavour and I was overwhelmed towards the end of my meal.  I got the Char Grilled Shish Kafta for $16.  \"...on pita\", according to the menu actually means 1/4 of the pita is placed on top of the beef and the salad is a small bowl of greens.  It's good, but let's just say if you're hungry and on a budget, this place is not recommended for you.  Also, the prices are actually more than what it is printed online.

The service was average, one waitress for the whole evening on a Sunday night.  It wasn't busy though, and I guess they knew that so they only have one person on duty.  

Another thing, I thought it was a bit tacky that they served us with pita in sandwich bags...and I mean those ziplock sandwich bags. All 4 baskets on our tables have pitas stuffed in sandwich bags, wrapped in black napkin.  It wasn't heated or anything, it's like they just grabbed it from their storage and placed it on our table.

It's something worth a try if you're in the area.  You may enjoy the taste but it's not something worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place ever since seeing the sign pop up in the neighborhood... sadly, all the anticipation didn't work out in the end.

Went in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, and I was in the mood for a chicken Shawarma, but that is not on the menu so I got the Char Grilled Shish Kafta.  I found it salty and portion wise not what i was hoping for.

My girlfriend got the Beef Shawarma, once again fairly salty and very average in the wide world of Toronto Shwarma.

Considering we did a sitdown dinner as opposed to take-out the price point was higher than i would have liked.

It's just down the street from my house, and despite the convenience I'm not going back.

My recommendation is to find a \"PITA & GRILL\" franchise and go get a Chicken Shawarma... best in the city by far!"}
{"text":"Had falafel, lentil soup, baba ganouch great! Excellent use of space and design. Nice ambiance and great waitress"}
