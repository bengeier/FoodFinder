{"text":"This was, hands down, my favorite place to spend time, on my mostly solo-business trip to Montreal. I came here repeatedly--for an al fresco beer, again for a coffee & croissant (then beer) during a rain-soaked morning, and finally brought friends for a beautiful steak dinner, and cocktails, under a full moon. 

It's basically self-service, no-frills, but oozing with along-the-banks-of-the river atmosphere. 
Perfect evening to escape the \"Old Montreal\" tourists. 

Bonus tip: Hop on a bicycle,  just outside le Marché des ´Eclusiers, and pedal along the St Lawrence River, and through Old Montreal.  ($3.50 US)

{"text":"Très cool comme endroit par contre les prix sont dispendieux mais le cadre super sympa et on se croit en vacances"}
{"text":"Love love love the concept of this open air and organic market on the canal! 
You can find fresh juice, barbecue fares, coffee and teas, everything you need to spend a lovely afternoon...
I have not tried the food at the bar since they did not have vegetarian options. 
Volcanic organic coffee bar offers great options for coffee from a single source in Guatemala \"farm to cup\" style.
Boucherie Lawrence and omnivore also have a stand.
I'm exited to see this really cool spot grow and offer more unique and organic dishes! 
Will definitely be back on a regular basis.

The setting on the canal is idyllic...come the evening and it's a really chill place to have a drink with your friends.
That's all you need to know! (For now)"}
{"text":"It's nice to sit outside and enjoy the view. Staff members just walk by, look at you and ignore you. What's up that music? Don't they have anything better than Saturday-ride-to-the-club douchebag FM playlists?"}
{"text":"Au coeur de la ville, du Vieux port, un marché, j'ai adoré dîner la-bas en amoureux, les lumières et le lieu ont quelques choses de magique."}
{"text":"I wish Pastaga was downstairs! It would be so nice to drink their biodynamic and natural wines on the main floor patio where the party really is. But that's the only reason I give this only 4 stars, because the downstairs space is beautiful. I came here once when Aperol was doing a free tasting of Spritz, which kind of made it amazing. It's perfect on a sunny afternoon, and I love the Thursday market. The meats are pricey but great quality and the vegetables are very affordable."}
{"text":"This Market is amazing great food, drinks and service. The vide is chill and it is very pretty and relaxing by the water."}
{"text":"Cool hipster vibe. Fun drinks and food. You're right at the Old Port, beside one of the locks ( this is why it's called Eclusie, lock in French). Young dynamic staff. It's also dog friendly, so you chill with your pooch. Sevice is slow."}
{"text":"Love love love. Love love.

Reasons you need to go to there - 

1. It's far enough away from the tourists while also being smack dab in the old city.
2. I love the view of the hulking, confusing, beautifully industrial Pointe de moulin.
3. You can have ANYTHING you want. Coffee? Check. Beer? Check. Fancy drinks? Check. How about some baked goods? Don't mind if I do. BBQ? Got you covered. Ice cream, juice bar, wine, etc. All the things that you want.
4. All that stuff? Yeah, it tastes good too.
5. The seating. So. Much. Seating. And usually at least some of it is shady.
6. Right along the canal path.
7. Did I mention ice cream?
8. Vibe. Summer is all about the vibe. This place has it."}
{"text":"It's a small foodcourt with a nice terrasse, I usually come here with my parents and brothers during summer. It's next to the canal, in old port. We order draught beers, and when hungry burgers and poutine. It's good for groups, since they have large benches."}
{"text":"We stubbled upon this charming place after spending the morning exploring Montreal. 

The laid back atmosphere and casual charm made this a perfect oasis after a long day of checking out this beautiful city. 

Neither of us speak fluent French, just a bit of Sesame Street French and our adorable server made sure we felt welcome here. Thank you. 

The food menu is small but definitely on point. The drink menu has a lovely selection and offers something for everyone.

The weather was warm, the drinks were cold, the food...delicious. A bacon cheeseburger for hubby and a toasted bagel with smoked salmon and a soft boiled egg nestled in the middle for me. Uncomplicated and cooked with care, no complaints here. 

A lovely place to spend a leisurely Sunday."}
{"text":"Beautiful location! I've enjoyed this spot when it was a restaurant/bar. And now I'm glad to see it coming back to life as a farmers market!
The genius mind behind this project is a local favorite Fabergé. They brought together many Montreal restaurants and vendors such as Diablos. 
So far the list of vendors include: Diablos BBQ Smokehouse, Fabergé, Omnivore Épicerie-Traiteur, La Petite Boulangerie, Nectar & Co. bar à jus, Eileen's (seafood), and Café Volcanic Organic.
It's truly a nice relaxing location for a break when strolling around old port, or to spend a night drinking and eating fresh local food."}
{"text":"Excellent place to chill during late spring summer and fall time. 
It's like a market but more lively thanks to all the small bars and shops.  There is an amazing chilling terrace with colourful chairs and everyone is really nice and take the time to explain you their products and the collective idea. 
A bit far away from the main tourists area you feel like privileged to sit here and cool down with a nice iced coffee. 
Great vibes and peaceful energy. I definitely can say it's one of my favourite chilling places"}
{"text":"I was here for the press launch with some Yelp Elites so I'll have to update when I go back on a regular day, but man! Just based on the beautiful location and design of the space, how it's on the relaxing lovely edge of the Old Port, the great big picnic tables, the plants, the big central BBQ, the two bars, the local veggies and amazing bakery and boucherie, all the hyper local partners in the space, the long lovely upstairs deck with comfy chairs and excellent bottles, everything about this space makes it a place local and travellers alike will love spending time. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Très bel endroit. 
Service courtois mais lent (surtout pour le café!) compte tenu de l'achalandage. 
Prix très élevés pour ce que l'on retrouve dans l'assiette."}
{"text":"Ce petit marché tout fraîchement rénové et ouvert depuis peu est encore actuellement méconnu. J'estime qu'il vaut le détour plus en raison du fait qu'il propose une terrasse à l'écart du brouhaha du vieux port et loin des zones touristiques. La terrasse est superbe, en soirée avec les lumières c'est féerique. Toutefois les prix sont assez conséquents. De petits burger à partir de 14$ et les prix vont en montant. Un pichet de sangria classique plus de 30$ ça fait mal au portefeuille sachant que la sangria est remplie de glaçons et ne goûte pas grand chose à vrai dire. On se laisse charmer par le décor, on y amène sa future conquête mais on prévoit un plan b pour se remplir le ventre!!"}
{"text":"This place by the water is my go-to place for drinks, snack or full meal. They sell fresh market products and the view is nothing short of relaxing with the Silo5 facing it. Most importantly, dogs are allowed on location. HUGE plus for me. On average, we make our way to Marché des Eclusiers every two weeks during summer. All of my photos have already been posted on this page. :))"}
{"text":"Walk the canal and chill out at the open air market.

While on vacation in Montreal we hit the Old Port area and walked over here to relax with a drink by the water.

Seems like they are developing the area to be a happening spot with great views and local purveyors offering local eats and drinks. Great spot that they have done a nice job with, and  a cool concept.

A few bars, BBQ joint, baked goods, coffee, and more can be found here now.

Take a seat by the water with some libations and a bite to eat from one of the food stands, kick back, and take it all in. 

Enjoy life."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to spend a summer evening.  The Marché des Éclusiers is located just outside the main area of the Old Port and is right by the water.  There are a few different food and drink vendors and there is tons of outdoor seating so you can sit around on a nice day and capitalize on the weather to take in the views of the canal.  My only complaint is that it is really pricey.  I  paid $11 for a beer before tip which is a little excessive in my opinion.  
It still is a solid spot though to hit up while you are in the Old Port."}
{"text":"Nouvellement ouvert (de mai à novembre) ce Marché des Éclusiers est un hybride entre marché bio local/café/bar à vin/boulangerie, un gros mix de tous quoi avec une belle terrasse extérieure en plus avec vue sur le canal Lachine et le Vieux-Port. Une super idée à mon avis. Vous avez donc une boulangerie (La Petite Boulangerie), une boucherie (Boucherie Lawrence), un café (Volcanic Organic), une poissonnerie (Eileen), un bar à jus (Nectar Juice & Co.), bar à vin (VIN RX) localisé au 2e étage, salades/soupes (Omnivore) et pour les amateurs de viande (Diablos BBQ Smokehouse). Pour ma part, nous y sommes allés en soirée pour boire, une bière sur la terrasse extérieure. Belle ambiance, style beergarden, sympa et tranquille, un samedi soir. Le calme avant la découverte de cette jolie terrasse extérieure dans le Vieux-Port ? À savoir, aucun service aux tables, on paie au bar et on se sert soi-même. J'y retournerai pendant l'été pour y manger et goûter à tout. À découvrir ! 

5/5 visité en mai 2016"}
{"text":"I was invited to the official press opening day by Yelp and I am extreamly greatful for that, since it might have taken me  longer to discover this unique location.
Great setup just by the river, one cool complex of a culinary guilt pleasure. You have here everything from an open bar, amazing cocktail place, fresh food, vegtables , pastery shops , coffee place and even a wine bar upstairs. I tasted many things and every thing was of the highest quality. Loved the location, the setup, the varity, the atmosphere and most importent the cool Yelp people that I met there that really made it into an awasome expirience. It is a little far from other places in the old port bit come with a few good friends and I promise you great memories"}
{"text":"Oh so many pleasures at this delightful open air marché! The usual farmers' market goodness, plus a BBQ restaurant, a wine bar, incredible water and warehouse views and calming, joyful vibes abound.

If I lived in Montreal, picking up my weekly treats (and making a little date out of it!) at Marché des Éclusiers would always be high on my list of things to do. If anyone I know in Montreal is planning a big event, I'm going to direct them here. The skeleton of this indoor/outdoor space makes my heart sing. Admittedly, I was here for an event, so it probably had some extra sparkle that night, but their roster of folks looks fabulous. I truly can't say enough good things about it..."}
{"text":"Another beautiful terrasse to chill with friends and have some good fast food. Looks like a fair with cozy people. You can eat and drink but not very cheap."}
{"text":"Twice now I've ventured to Marché des Éclusiers on my day off and enjoyed a beautiful and crisp bottle of white on the terrasse overlooking the canal, and allow me to say, nothing beats it. I find the actual market space kinda pricey and without anything that would otherwise interest me but the wine bar is wonderful. Both visits were also accompanied by really friendly and wine-savvy service- perfect for a pretty and semi-secluded drink."}
