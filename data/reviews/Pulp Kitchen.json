{"text":"Ordered a \"vitality\" smoothie. Pros * delicious and light, really like the cayenne kick Cons * I was the only customer and the juicer/staff took a long time to make it, spend more time on the phone after my order han actually making my shake, wait was wayyy too kong"}
{"text":"Granola crunchers rejoice! Pulp Kitchen is a vegetarian, health-conscious hotspot in hip Leslieville, which provides a killer eggless omelet with soy cheese (highly recommend) and daily specials ranging from tomato kale soup, to a Mexican style quinoa wrap, to a host of delicious sandwiches with ingredients that include avocado, grains and other fresh vegetables  For those who have read any of my other reviews, note a recurrent theme.... while I'm not exclusively veg, I love meatless, cheeseless food!  They have trivial pursuit and Battleship games on the table.   While it's a haven for vegetarians and vegans alike, the prices are too high and the staff can be temperamental. While one waitress is really sweet, the other who served us was pretty rude and banged items down on the table. Perhaps it had been a bad day. Brunch usually costs about 40 dollars, plus tip, for two people, which exceeds the cost of some of my other favorite brunch locales.  Will I go back?  Probably.   Will it been soon?  Probably not."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is really how I'm feeling about both of my experiences at the new Pulp Kitchen. I've visited their various locations along Queen Street over the years and it's never been a place I've been super compelled to return to. Today's experience on the Danforth validated that feeling.   The first time I went was very soon after they opened. I saw that they had a lunch combo for $10 and got a smoothie and soup. The smoothie was tasty, the soup was nothing special, but it was nice to have another option in the neighborhood. The staff seemed frazzled, but it was pretty early into their tenure on the Danforth  I was passing by to run an errand on my lunch today and thought a smoothie & soup would be a nice option for today's chilly temperatures. I went to order the combo with a smoothie and the soup of the day and was told that wasn't an option and was shown the list. I said that was strange since I had gotten it before and was told that someone must have gotten it wrong because a smoothie and a soup are treated as the same thing. Given that it would actually be less expensive for me to order a soup ($5.75) and smoothie ($6.25) than ordering a more expensive salad or wrap along with it, I don't get the logic. But sure, it's not part of the lunch deal, so I get it.   I ended up walking out without getting anything because I can walk over to the Big Carrot and get a tastier soup and more exciting smoothie for less than $10."}
{"text":"Sorry Pulp.  I have to update my review to reflect the last few times I've been here...  You were rated as having the best granola in the city, but three times in a row you've been out of both soy and regular yogurt. I was told all three times that it had something to do with your supplier. You may wanna fix that.  Three strikes, Pulp. I'm not gonna make the disappointing trek to your establishment when there are so many other awesome breakfast spots in the area..."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review in celebration.  It appears that they may have shut down.... unless they are undergoing renos... let's hope not.    Anyway, some Vegan meat-hater took me there a while ago.  The entire time I was thinking \"I too could make these sausages with sawdust\" or \"Wow, didn't know you could make scrambled eggs with tofu and bran flour\".  Then I thought to myself isn't Okay Okay across the street and why didn't we go there?  Farewell Pulp Kitchen - much like a Vincent Vega pop-tart incident."}
{"text":"It's soy good!  I've had take out from there a few times and was satisfied every time. Good quality ingredients at a great price. Even my non-vegan co-workers enjoyed Pulp. I hope to try more of their menu soon."}
{"text":"I've known about Pulp Kitchen for ages and ages, and have only just recently (late August) made it to their new location to give them a try. It's easy to get to, and the light and airy decor make it a pleasure to sit in and eat. Unfortunately I found the service to be a little slow - we waited a good 10 minutes after getting our menus and making our choices before our order was taken, a bit silly considering there were barely half a dozen diners besides myself and my two companions. I dread to think of what it's like when they're busy! On the upside, the wait for drinks and food was less painfully drawn out.  All three of us got drinks from the extensive menu, my friends getting a premium juice and smoothie respectively. I was all set to get a nice healthy juice when I saw the \"Funky Monkey\" - Chocolate soymilk, banana and a shot of espresso. Oh, yes please and thank you, could you maybe hook up a tap in my house? Incredible stuff - and adorably garnished with a coffee bean on top.  We were in on a Sunday - early afternoon - so it was brunch time. They have a reasonable selection of meals and sides - the fruity topped french toast sounded appealing, and I also got a side order of breakfast sausages and home fries.   My french toast topping was strawberry syrupy heaven, with a nice crunch of slivered almonds - however the french toast itself was disappointing (barely warm, kinda soggy). I'm not sure the sausages were worth it at $1 each (the side was $3, and there were $3 of them), and while the home fries were perfectly delicious and well-cooked, I would've liked about 3 times the portion size for $3. My dining companions felt similarly about their meals (PK Sandwich and Breakfast Burritos) - pretty tasty and well put together, but seriously lacking in portion size when it comes to the price.  I think if I were out in the Beaches area more, i'd drop in to PK for drinks and light snacks again. As it stands though, I'm not sure i'd make a special trip out there (except to maybe pick up a gallon of Funky Monkey...). 3 stars because the food is nice, the drinks are amazing and it's a nice atmosphere - but PK loses what could be a more decent rating because of their high costs.  [Side note - Pulp Kitchen's recently revamped website is a bit useless in that the sidebar of links doesn't actually go anywhere unless you add .html to the end - just in case you want to check out their fare before visiting!]"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying something tasty and healthy at Pulp Kitchen and spent some time deciding what I wanted. When I finally said I wanted one of the salads as described on their wall, a very unfriendly girl scrunched up her face because apparently she couldn't hear me and then unceremoniously pointed out where the salads are - at the counter, in plastic containers, COMPLETELY different than what was on the wall. So much for fresh.  Work on your customer service Pulp Kitchen, because it sucks. I ended up walking out without buying anything. This was on April 18 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Since this PK opened, I have wondered at times at its consistency. Not just with food, but with their front-line staff. As I've dropped in every so often, there is usually somebody new being trained, so in the end, I walk away with their \"in-training\" smoothie (watery), PK sandwich (cold with a portion of breaded tofu, missing the tofu!).   I like that they have healthy options, a lunch special and are completely vegan, but one giant pet peeve is that everything is encased in plastic. I would opt to dine in to avoid increasing my plastic consumption, but even when you want a salad, the staff direct you to the ready-made ones in the fridge. More plastic. I've often asked, is it recyclable? Various members of staff shake their head and say they don't know. It would be awesome, if they would start using compostable or biodegradable containers in the near future.   Oh and a word to the wise, their almond milk latte is... just awful (I know, who goes into a juice place and asks for this when Crema cafe is just down the street.). My point is that the brand of almond milk they use is incredibly salty! It would also be nice if they carried coconut milk and coconut yogurt as well."}
{"text":"Is this the only vegan restaurant in Leslieville!?  I thought this neighborhood is like your upcoming and most cool hood or the ville.  Oh well, let's do this.    The place is bigger than it looks from the outside, and the sign is really hard to read so like my friends, we all missed it while riding the street car.  The service is really friendly and nice.  I got a pint of green smoothie, yum, just what I needed when I can't find kombucha anywhere in canada.  Finally, my friend who was super late showed up.  She said she couldn't find the restaurant.  She literally walked by it few times up and down the block.  I got this tofu sandwich, DELICOIUS!!!! It was really REALLY good.  I don't remember what it was called but I love the tofu with the sauce.  The fried potatoes are super good too.  I would come back for the tofu sandwich for sure.  I wonder if they have vegan baked goods.   PS: We sat next to a green party candidate and his campaign manager, she and him did not get along.  It was super awkward listening to them arguing.  At least it wasn't a tory."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start with this review.   I expected so much better, and maybe that's why I'm left feeling like I should never return.   To begin with, there's only one table that sits more than two people, which is a problem if you're not a couple.   The wait was pretty long, but there were several double tables that were free.  How's about seating more efficiently.  When we finally got seated, we were served by a friendly waitress.   We got our orders in quickly and then waited.  And waited.  And waited.   We asked to get the soup for our kids a little sooner, since it was just a matter of scooping it out.  However, our waitress seemed afaid of the over-testoneroned chef.   The other server working, however, just pushed into the kitchen past the afforementioned cook and got the soup.    The table for four is right next to the kitchen, so we got to watch the chef, in all her glory, shouting condescendingly at her staff and generally creating a hostile environment.     When we finally got our food, it was mediocre - the burrito was unpleasantly sweet, the soup bland, the grilled cheese not so nice.   The only saving grace was the PK sandwich, which tasted amazing in comparison.  Outside of Pulp, I suspect the PK would only be average, but it runs with a weak crowd now, so stands out."}
{"text":"Gracious owner. I'd bought a Group on for three days juice cleanse, called the number to let them know I would be showing up for my purchase. I however went to the wrong address,( They have a store on the Dan forth as well as Queen East)the one at Dan forth. It was a frigid day and I'd taken the train all the way from the west end. And I did not look forward to trekking in the ice and snow to go some place else. The owner (Marie) paid for a cab to take me to the address at Queen East. She was very pleasant and knowledgeable about her products and seemed to genuinely care about one's health and not just selling health food. On the whole the juices tasted great except for the V6-Tomato was competing fiercely with the beet. Held my nose to drink that! I was very hungry especially on the send and third days. I didn't cheat though. I had coconut water or vegetable broth when I felt famished on my 12 hour overnight shift-as I was advised,. I lost a few pounds temporarily-gained them back when i started eating again. I've felt so much better since doing the cleanse. I haven't had to take my stomach meds for horrible GERD since then (about four weeks now) Hope I will have the will-power to do the juice cleanse from Pulp Kitchen again."}
{"text":"BEST VEGAN BRUNCH IN TORONTO!  This place is a game changer!  Try the absolutely unreal french toast topped with tons of fruit.  It's better than any french toast (vegan or non-vegan) you've ever had.    Also amazing: the omelet.  It's not vegan as there is cheddar cheese in it, but if you're vegan you can ask for them to take out the cheese and replace it with the stuff they use for the mac + cheese.  It will blow your mind.  You won't believe it's eggless!    The service: lovely, attentive, extremely helpful.  The new space is bright and clean and very comfortable.  If making the trek to Leslieville seems like a pain believe me when I say that it is totally worth it.  You'll never think twice about going that far east again."}
{"text":"When we first walked into this awesome restaurant, the wildly inventive music of Cibo Matto was booming on the stereo.   It's no irony that the words \"Cibo Matto\" loosely translate as  'Food Crazy' in Italian.   These people love their food.   It comes across in every delicious Quinoa-filled bite.  Trivial pursuit on the table.   I get almost every question wrong but do not care.  I love this place for lunch.  I love this place for brunch.  A restaurant that truly makes me forget that it's actually a health-conscious palace of multigrain madness.  This place is completely food crazy."}
{"text":"Imagine myself being a Vegan/Vegetarian one day...  It ain't that bad... it is not a nightmare....  To tell you the truth if you ask me if I going to eat from now on the food items of Pulp Kitchen VS Stockyards... Pulp Kitchen will be the winner!  Love the Blueberry Waffles... and all these Fresh Fruits! You sure that is healthy food?? It tastes like a dessert... not too sweet but hmmmm Fresh Fruits... need I say more.  The French Toast I do find it a little dry.. and tasted and look like something that I can put together without any cooking skill... hmmm will skip that next time.  Now I have a few of my vegetarian friends I don't mind going with them for lunch/brunch if they willing to come to Pulp Kitchen.  Services here is nice and friendly... and all our questions gladly answered!"}
{"text":"I'll bet you didn't know that Greg C and I were twins. We both (unknowingly) dined at the same two restaurants within a 24 hour period.   And at the second of these, the newly re-opened Pulp Kitchen, we ordered the same sandwich AND juice! So bizarre. The \"PK Sandwich\" consists of crispy breaded tofu, oven roasted tomatoes, sliced avocado and cilantro dijon mayo on toasted flax served with baked homefries and mixed greens ($9.50). With that I had a V6 juice (freshly juiced tomato, spinach, carrot, celery, beet and green pepper).   What I like about the fresh juices here is that they come in three sizes, the smallest of which is actually quite affordable if all you want is a sampling of flavour. I believe it's $3 for 250mL.   My sandwich was excellent - so good, in fact, that I ordered it again a few days later when I dined with Greg C, along with the soup of the day, tomato rice. I love rice soups and this one was no exception. I had a hard time deciding between it and the butternut squash and black bean chili but I know I'll soon be back to try that one as well.   The decor is nice and simple and they have a partially open kitchen where you can see your food being made. I also like the fact that they sell merchandise, and healthy cookbooks would be a nice addition to their stock.  As mentioned in my review of the original Pulp Kitchen (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pulp-kitchen-toronto#hrid:txkfA5A65041jULL-46djw - now the home of Lady Marmalade), I must take issue with their early hours - for a person like me who works from home nearby, only being open till 6pm is fine, but I would love to bring a friend here for dinner sometime. Unfortunately it's not possible. Perhaps as they find their place in Leslieville they'll expand their hours - after all, they've only been open since the beginning of November."}
{"text":"Delicious Sunday brunch - could have fooled any carnivore who loathes anything vegetarian.  The blueberry waffles were amazing, along with fresh fruit and maple syrup.  As was the tofu scramble wrap, and not to mention the smoothies.  Here's the thing though...  Having ONE person working the entire floor on a Sunday during brunch rush is probably not the best idea.  And man was she frazzled.  Also, yes, I get the vegetarian thing, I even get the vegan thing, but doesn't vegan mean NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS in the restaurant?  So then why the \"dairy yogurt\" option on the menu?  It wouldn't have bothered me if I hadn't gotten a snarky response from said frazzled server when I asked if the \"coconut creme\" had diary in it (uh...we're vegan .... no animal byproducts...)  Can't wait to go back - I just hope they have more people working the floor, or one that can handle a full restaurant."}
