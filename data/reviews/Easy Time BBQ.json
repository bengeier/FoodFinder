{"text":"Service is good. Food is no expansive at all. My wife and I been here 2 times in 3 days, won't wait too long  to be next time cause it's kinda hard to find Good BBQ around........."}
{"text":"Ordered a pork combination plate, with yogurt drink, combo came with soup: delicious, salad: meh, kimchi: meh, and peanuts. 

the entree is pretty good, meat is a little too lean for my taste but I'm not an expert in Hawaiian(?) dish to say anything. 

Yogurt drink is fantastic, perfect for vegas day time. 

Service is prompt and professional. decor is simple and clean."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Good service Good food! The chicken wing are so delicious.  I also like the tea over there.  We ordered 96 skewers and the price are only 112 total.  I also like the oden.  I had a very good time there. ????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great little place for tapas! After BeeGees closed - we have been searching for a place for our skewer fix! This is definitely the place for that! We ordered the lamb skewer which was seasoned with cumin and it was very tender! The chicken heart skewer was also great! 

The crispy taro was on the house! The servers were super sweet! 

The black bean pork ribs was a great deal! Comes with kimchi, soup, salad and rice! 

Definitely come check it out! Worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! It's a new place and the atmosphere here is nice. Of all the Chinese BBQ restaurants I've been to, it is by far the best. Why? their BBQ skewers are cheap(er) and are bigger. In the end, I think I ate my Moneys worth."}
{"text":"Cute spot with cozy, private booths. Menu includes a variety of tapas-sized apps and snacks, plus combination plate specials and boba drinks. I wasn't really impressed with what I tried but would consider coming back for other items.

POKE: $6 app was a flavorful (shoyu?) tuna version, fish was fresh, recommend this dish.
SKEWERS: as every other review states, these are seasoned in an insane amount of cumin. It's like a paste coating every skewer, to the point where you can't even taste the meat. Whoever's in the kitchen needs to chill on the seasoning.
MACARONS: These were a surprise! Ordered them for a small, sweet treat and expected them to be dry and crumbly, as at so many places in Vegas. But the 2 piece lemon flavor was soft, delicate, and had a great punch of citrus flavor! It's completely nuts to come here for more macarons, yet I'm pretty sure that's what will keep them on my radar.

Service was quick, prices are fairly low. The d√©cor is cute and the booths would be great for catching up with a friend or having a more private (but still casual) date. They'll have to improve the food (other than the macarons, obviously) for me to come back, though."}
{"text":"Found a great place for the traditional Chinese flavor skewer. Definitely will come back for great tasting food and wonderful service. Oh and this place open until 2AM."}
{"text":"This place far exceeded my expectations. The decor is beautiful. The employees are very attentive and service-oriented. We tried lamb, beef, and sliced potato skewers. The lamb and beef tasted fresh and soft. The potato skewers were well grilled until it turned crispy. Overall this place is awesome. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friends and i tried this restaurant and found that their skewers such as Lotus, Chicken legs taste weird. Fried taro not crispy at all and too hard chew. Singapore Fried Noodle is too salty. Salmon bento is not tasty but acceptable. Rose tea pot is good. We commented to the waiter about the food taste issue we order and hope they can improve it in the future. But the waiter did not accept our comments and said that we did not get use to their cooking. Good luck to everyone if you would like to taste this bad food. We will not go back to this restaurant or recommend to my friend unless they improve their cooking."}
{"text":"We came in at around 9 at night. The place was difficult for us to find with the lack of lighting illuminating that area of the plaza. The place was decorated nicely, and the booth seating was very comfortable! I think since the booths were draped with these decorative curtains we were not in sight of the server, so we would have to wave him over whenever we needed to be helped. When you order, you mark on a laminated sheet with a dry erase marker. I thought that was pretty clever. Although, I thought I had marked for the chicken katsu musubi, but instead got regular spam musubi. Make sure you are marking the proper one, because you're marking its number rather than it having the name of the dish on the paper. So! Onto the food:

Grilled Squid: 5/5 Good sized portion. Very flavorful, good texture.

Lychee Milk Tea with Boba: 3.5/5 Taste is good, but I'm very picky with my boba texture. Not as squishy as I would have liked. I really liked that the milk tea wasn't super sweet tho. 

Spam Musubi: 5/5 Can't really mess this one up. I noticed that the rice was topped with some sauce. Spam is cooked til warm rather than browned. I know everyone has different versions/preferences, just thought I'd give a description.

Chicken Katsu Musubi: 4/5 A nice spin on musubi. I just wish they had topped it with katsu sauce or had something on the side. Overall, very tasty.

BBQ Beef Skewer: 1.5/5 This was supposed to be free with taking a photo and sharing on Facebook. Ended up charging us. That itself wasn't a big deal, it was very inexpensive anyway. The taste was not good. They put wayyyy to much cumin on the meat, and I love cumin! I just don't want to feel like that was all I am eating. I left .5 because I felt like it was cooked well, the texture of the meat was nice and tender, but I was only able to eat two bites. Even a spoonful of rice didn't cancel it out. 

Service was decent, I give it a 4/5 for it being in Chinatown. They were very polite. 

My boyfriend and I were the only ones here, but this place is fairly new. Overall it was a nice place to have date night! Hopefully the service is still decent when they have more customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the meal I had there a couple of days ago.

I had skewers:  taro, lotus root, chicken claws, and peppers. The chicken was just right--not falling apart, but not tough. Watch out for those peppers. I thought they'd be something milder like shishito, but they were jalapenos. One skewer was two peppers, and you get two skewers per order. Just one pepper was enough for me, though I finished one skewer.

I also ordered the unagi kabayaki.  It was good, but pretty standard. Came with a small side salad and small bowl of kimchi.

I'm planning to go back once the weather cools down to try their oden."}
{"text":"Love this place! The hubby and I were randomly looking for a place to eat in Vegas and was craving for a bbq street style/yakitori food and we were lucky enough to find it! Newly opened but definitely delicious! Love the service and the great food that is sooo worth the price (big servings)!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because it got 4.5 stars.  Everything looked really great in the pictures.  The venue is nice and quaint with good sized booths flanking the walls.  One side was more open, the other side had booths with drapes and dividers between each booth going most of the way up the wall. This made it feel a little more private.  It was also nice and quiet.  I hate it when these places think they are some sort of club.  This cafe clearly knows it's place, playing cheesy Asian covers of pop songs, low, in the background, and not blasting out of overworked cheap speakers.  I could actually hear.

The food was just OK.  I go the braised beef combo.  The soup and little peanut dressing salad were standard, but good.  The Braised Beef was flavorful, but really fatty.  This should have been expected for that dish, so I can't fault them for that.  The broccoli was super raw though, it looked and felt like it came right out of the earth, just then.  

They didn't have Thai iced coffee, only Thai Iced tea. The waiter looked confused when I asked for Thai Iced Coffee, but he offered to make it, and if I didn't like it, it would be free.  It wasn't Thai Iced coffee, but it was good.  If I could give this 3.5 due to the coffee and the waiter I would. Venue and waiter get a 4.  I just can't give the place a 4 due to the food.  My friend that her smoothie was more slushy ice than smooth, and devoid of the fruit flavor - mango, NO!"}
{"text":"I like this place i thought it was pretty tasty had the skewers ... the chicken was perfectly cooked ... and had the corn as well yummmy they dont serve it with butter so asked them for it ... corn was really good ... overall i enjoyed the food and serice .. real nice cozy spot .... date type matieral.."}
{"text":"Service was good and everything but the food wise .. we got combination meal comes with salad, soup and rice well the soup are Egg drop soup and it was sweet and has that weird after taste, I had the beef sirloin has after taste .. the bbq skewers too much seasoning 
.. so basically I don't recommend or even I am not coming back to this place it's nice to try a new place .. since the rating here was a descent enough to go .. 

Btw people who gives good ratings get free boba .. so they probly did for it lol. Idk I'm just saying .."}
{"text":"very good and taste?find a good place for chinese tea and Skewers?The skewers is biger than Normal?Its good place for hang out!you will love here~~"}
{"text":"Came in after my girlfriend found a flyer on the ground and decided on spur of the moment to try it.

The decor of the cave is excellent. It's simple, cute, and really makes you want to come in. 

The milk tea was more tea and not sweet. We believe a lot of people like it that way but unfortunately my girlfriend does not like it.

The whole squid and chicken wings was the best thing we had, it was barbecued with their spice blend. 

The one thing I noticed that kind of annoys me about the skewers though is that traditionally the skewers should be cooked so that it is a little charred to maximize the flavor of the rub. The meat in my opinion was cooked lightly, basically just so it wasn't raw.

We also had the chicken heart skewers which were tough as nails. Not sure why they were so tough. My girlfriend thinks it's because they boil them before they grill them which is a no no because it shrinks them and makes it denser. 

Curry chicken was super watery and had almost no flavor. You can see in the pictures how light and watery the sauce is. 

Overall it's a new restaurant that has kinks to be fixed. I would try going back in a month or two once they have figured out everything."}
{"text":"tasty and delicious little meals. ... ordered chicken, chicken hearts, chicken claws, beef,  lambs,  garlic,  mushroom wrapped in bacons skewers. very good kinda salty. not that spicy but has a little kick of spice. grilled squid was chewy and big.  grill fish,  bbq ribs combines were excellent and the serving dishes are decent. peanut butter noodle was okay...all the good foods w a warm up bottle of soju. will be back for more.  very mellow and cozy settling.  a very nice,  clean place to talk over with street foods and beer. will be back for more."}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of appetizers and dishes to share between 5 people. The word I would describe this place and the staff here is CUTE! Food was good and so cheap."}
{"text":"This a nice quiet place to catch up with friends:)

Boba: we tried a passion fruit milk tea and honey dew yogurt drink and both were amazing. Definitely would like to try more fruit flavors!

Food: we tried oden which are skewers that come with a sour/spicy broth. We had the shrimp and squid balls and squid is definitely the better choice. We also had taro skewers which was good if there wasnt too much cumin on it. We got a free beef skewers and they have the same seasoning as the taro skewer and like I said before, they like cumin here!

Overall, the service was good and prompt. Our server took time to answer our questions and even recommended us the honey dew yogurt drink. Its still a new place so they ask people for yelp review so they can better their service and food."}
