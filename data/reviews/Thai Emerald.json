{"text":"This was our first experience with Thai Emerald. My wife and I both ordered Pad Thai to go and it was pretty average.  It didn't have much flavor, it seemed like they forgot to toss in some spices.   On top of the average Pad Thai, we were charged a tip that we did not add on ourselves! Our total was $27 (and some change) and a few days later when our debit card processed, the total here was $30!  Like I said, we picked this food up to go, we did not eat inside.  Needless to say we will not be returning to Thai Emerald.

******update - We went back to Thai Emerald and they were helpful and very apologetic. They refunded the $3 and offered us a gift card as well (we declined).  We believe it was an honest mistake."}
{"text":"I love thai emerald! They have the best service and food of any Thai place in the lake Norman area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the area! The staff is so sweet and warm. My boyfriend and I have been ordering from here for years, and we keep coming back because it's delicious! Portions are enough to make meals for days, and are still great the next day. 

Recommend the satay chicken as an appetizer and massamum chicken curry (add pineapple)!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out of towners in the mood for some Pad Thai. We found Thai Emerald through Yelp and were totally pleased!! Nice and clean, friendly and wonderful Pad Thai! Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We had the scallop pad thai noodle and  pork with vegetables brown sauce.  Both dishes was good.  Service was very good too.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Visiting my extended family for the weekend,  we ordered quite a bit of food to go. They said it would be ready in 10 minutes. We got there in 8 minutes and it was ready to go! I got the massamun curry (native hot), and it was spot on. My only complaint was that it was a tad pricier than what I normally pay for Thai food."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a vegetarian friend. We got the vegetarian spring rolls which were lightly fried. Waiter was friendly. They did not have mock duck when we asked but waiter was interested in pursuing to see if that would be something they could add to the menu. We got two tofu dishes and shared. It was plenty of deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Thai and find many restaurants not up to my expectations but Thai Emerald
is very good.  The ingredients are very fresh and tasty, right on the mark.  The service is
efficient and very friendly."}
{"text":"Great people clean restaurant amazing food but........when I look at bill I'm charge a 19% tip already in my opinion gratuity comes from the heart & shouldn't be forced I actually planned to give a big tip until I noticed they already got their cut already in"}
{"text":"I read a lot of great reviews on here & hadn't had much luck finding Thai food in this area, so I was excited. However, I was thoroughly disappointed when I had my first bite. Quite frankly, the food was gross - it had a terrible chemically taste to it, tasted like I had just licked a nail salon, gross.

I had the chicken pad thai & unfortunately, so did my sister - her first thai restaurant experience. Earlier that week I had made homemade thai noodles with shrimp & peanut sauce at home which was MUCH better tasting than this and that was just with store bought noodles, sauce & frozen veggies/shrimp.

Needless to say, I am still on the lookout for a good Thai restaurant in the Concord/Huntersville/Charlotte area..."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in Huntersville.  I love the curry and my husband is a big fan of the Pad Thai.  We usually get take out but we've dine in the restaurant before as well.  Good service and quick take out."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I usually get the Pad See Ew and it's always delicious. I would recommend getting it a little spicy for some more flavor though. The lettuce wraps are also really good, on par with PF. Chang's in my opinion, and decently priced. There's always enough food for leftovers too! The sweet sticky rice for dessert is also one of my favorites - ask for it with vanilla ice cream on top instead of the custard. Although this place is never busy and therefore not a 'fun' dinner atmosphere, the service is always fantastic and quick. At least give it a try it for takeout :)"}
{"text":"I've only visited this place once, and think I will be back.  Place was very clean and the staff was very nice.  They serve a broth before they bring out your order, which I thought was good taste-wise, but it looked very oily to me.  I still went ahead and tried it and thought it was fine, just a bit oily...  I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it was very good!!  Very generous portion as well, which I like, :).  The Pad Thai and a Coke totaled $10 and change, nice deal!!  I will be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a good review for this place because the staff is so kind. Like so, so, so kind. But unfortunately I cannot. I am a little too well versed in authentic Thai cooking and I have found Thai Emerald to be so inconsistent in quality. Sometimes it's ok and sometimes it's bad. But my last visit two weeks ago was really  bad. The Tom Yum soup I ordered had a funny aftertaste. Like a flowery chemical. Almost like perfume fell into the soup. And then shortly after my eyes swelled up, the left one to hideous proportions. I am not one with food allergies, except to MSG. Not sure what \"fell\" into the soup but it assured I will not go back. Thai House a few miles away is much better. Consistent quality."}
{"text":"The food was more like Chinese food than Thai food,  both in taste/flavors/seasonings and also in the consistency of the sauces. We had the spring rolls,  fried dumplings,  cashew beef and tofu drunken noodles.  We won't be going back for seconds."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - small dining room, very friendly, helpful, and attentive staff, and a peaceful ambiance ... but the food is the thing and I found the food to be okay but not great. It was very nice that we were served a bowl of soup after we sat down, and the portions were generous, but the flavors were mild, not bursting. This was only my first visit but I have places closer that I like better so I may not try this again. FYI: I ordered the Pad see ew for lunch."}
{"text":"Pass on this place! Much better Thai in the area. My wife and I tried Thai Emerald since we were right there and were very disappointed. The chicken Pad Thai was awful. It was extremely bland, no flavor at all. The worst is that it smelled terrible. My daughter said it smelled like dog treats and that's pretty spot on. Not appealing at all. Two pad thai dishes for $30+ also...a tad procey for noodles. Sorry Thai Emerald, but you just lost a customer for good and I hope more stay away from your place. You've been warned people."}
{"text":"They have really stepped up their game. I went late on a Monday afternoon. The slightly burnt peanuts made the dish. I got heat setting 5. It was very spicy but faded quickly. Everything was fresh and delicious. It wasn't just thrown on a plate. You could tell they actually care about what they serve."}
{"text":"Well, I had high hopes for Thai Emerald. I really can't remember the first time I had Thai food, but I've been a fan of it since and every city I visit (or live in) the first thing I always look for is the best Chinese restaurant and the best Thai restaurant (and I can tell you, I've been to a lot of each). I disagree with the reviews that say Thai Emerald is bad...it is not; it's just not very good. It tastes \"homogenized\" for lack of a better term...it's almost like all the Thai flavor was taken out so that it would be more appealing for local palates. Of course there has to be some of that, but these guys took it too far. I've only eaten here three times, and each time the food was fine, but it certainly is not worth the price and it just doesn't taste...Thai; I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the food, but the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the people. Love the service.  

We eat here weekly, or at least try too.  My daughter loves the fried rice with onions, while my wife and I switch it up and try a few new dishes along with the tried and true meals.  Great food."}
{"text":"Only been once. I had the green curry, my favorite Thai dish which I've had many times at many places.  I thought the Thai Emerald 's version was decidedly mediocre.  The order came very quickly so I wondered if it had been prepared well in advance.  I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. We tend to order appetizers a good bit and let me tell ya, you will crave the beef satay. We have tried the sweet mee krob, basically their lettuce wrap and it is excellent as well. Their fresh rolls are good but I always ask for mine without the mint and they always accommodate my request.  The staff is always friendly and extremely helpful, always quick with your service and the decor is nice, a little plain but nice."}
{"text":"I live downtown but work in Huntersville. I love to eat Thai food but I'm cheap so I like to grab it for lunch when the prices are better then hit take out for dinner on my way home. My favorite place is Thai Taste on East Blvd. Thai is the closest one to my work is Thai Emerald. I have only had take out once, got the chicken pad Thai. I thought it would be safe. It was good, satisfied my Thai craving. Was not at the same level as Thai Taste but I can see myself going back. I would rather spend the 6.95 on lunch there then most of the places around me.
Cheers"}
{"text":"Thai Emerald is great, the quality is somewhere between take out style and nice sit down style.

The quality is not as great as Thai House, but the heat and flavors are more consistent.

I definitely recommend the Thai Boxing dish!"}
{"text":"I'd recommend it and wouldn't hesitate to eat here again. What a find! Great food, prepared fresh and good service. They are willing to customize your dish to your liking. Remove items, add other items, adjust the spiciness, they even offered to pull the tails off of my shrimp. 

It was a nice sit down restaurant with great Thai food (one of my favorite cuisines). I have stopped in here for lunch several times.This place was a well rated Thai.

I had the Tom Yum with shrimp which ranked among the best I've had. For my main entrée I had the curry with chicken. The combination of flavors was fantastic, light and just the right amount of spicy. Everything was fresh and cooked just right."}
{"text":"After a long bike ride I needed to refuel (don't worry I showered first). I walked in at 8:30, they close at 9, and I was greeted with a smile. There was only one other table in the restaurant and they were finishing up. I was offered a booth and I ordered a Thai tea. This sweet nectar was hard not to gulp down but I only had a few sips while I waited for my Thai Tulips and Gaeng Mussamun. When my food arrived I felt like I was sitting at my grandmother's table, the presentation was flawless. White and blue tableware held my feast. The jasmine rice was in a covered dish awaiting my spoon. The curry was a perfect flavor (I'm not a spice guy...so there was no heat) and the Thai Tulips were creamy and delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always a great meal.  Speed is also a benefit here.  Always a friendly staff.  The Pad Thai is our favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Checked out Thai Emerald this week before a meeting up in Huntersville. Decor is nice, but not pretentious. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Ordered my norm of the Pad Wu Sen w/beef. Good flavor and spice. The server presented their \"spice tray\" which was nice and came with 4 different \"heat\" options to elevate the spice. Menu is in depth and full of options for everyone. A-OK!"}
{"text":"Good Pad Thai. Bad fresh spring rolls---  too much lettuce and it was boring iceburg."}
{"text":"An amazing deal for a lunch special and pretty good Thai food in general.  I'd say the best in the area between Charlotte to Mooresville  Its just that getting in and out of that area mixed with the lack luster service I've experienced keeps me away from 4-5 stars.

I have only been for lunch, but they just seem to purposely under staff the place.  There is one lady that answers the phone, cashes out dine-in/take out, and is the server for all of the tables.  I assume they have more employees at more peak hours, but when I've been, if the phone rings for take-out I no longer have a server.  They should at least get a kitchen staff person to refill drinks.

As per the food, the lunch special is a soup, egg roll, and pretty nice sized portions of food.  All this for like $6-$9 depending on the protein.  I normally just stick with the chicken in a curry sauce and I've never been disappointed in the food.

All this said, I'll keep coming back, assuming I'm not in a hurry.  Or I might just take it to go."}
{"text":"Food - I'm not new to Thai food, but I don't eat it very often. For that reason, I haven't tried that many new dishes. I've been to this restaurant twice now, once for dine in and once for take out. Both experiences were great. The food is served quickly. The quality and taste of the food is really good.

Service - When I dined in, I asked for a suggestion. The waitress was hesitant, but helped me decide. The food arrived very quickly and the waitress checked often enough to keep our glasses full.

Atmosphere - This is a casual restaurant. There seemed to be several repeat customers who were greated by name by the employees.

I'll definitely be back and can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"We're fairly new to Thai food but have had it in other areas of North Carolina and love this place. The food is well priced with good sized portions.  The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and clean.  I would recommend that if you're in the Huntersville area, this is the Thai restaurant to try!!"}
{"text":"My fav spot for Thai! Everyone there is so super nice and friendly!!!! I get take out there more than I should lol!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying this place and having my first Thai meal in the Charlotte area and it's not that it was a disappointment but it just fell a bit short of what I was hoping for, so I'm giving it 3 stars for A-OK. 

As others have pointed out, the service is good. The staff is friendly and polite and they do a nice job of making you feel welcome. 

The food was good, not great. Although the dessert was really tasty, but I'll get to that later. The appetizer we had of the fried tofu with sweet and sour sauce was pretty good. They served it HOT and it was fresh but the initial bite was too hot for my friend and I that we slightly burnt our tongues and lost flavor for a bit. For my entree I had the vegetarian red curry at level 3 (out of 5) spiciness and thought it was kind of mediocre. Maybe if there was more spice it could've been better, but as it was, I could go through my plate but I wasn't crazy about it, it lacked punch. I also was bummed to see that they only served white rice. I normally eat brown rice for health reasons and a lot of Thai restaurants usually have that as an option but Thai Emerald only offered one type. However, dessert was my favorite and they did score well with the fried banana w/ice cream. There was miscommunication with our server and I and instead of the typical coconut ice cream that is standard with fried banana, I got mango ice cream, which oddly turned out to be very, very good! I thought the combination would taste bad but the tarty mango flavor blended with the syrup on the fried banana just hit it for me. If back, I will likely get this combo again. 

Something else I liked about Thai Emerald is they advertise in the local Clipper and the coupon saved us quite some change. Considering we had a three course meal and plus a drink, we did not spend too much and left full. 

I probably won't be a regular here but it's fine for an occasional run. I also wouldn't mind having the dessert again."}
{"text":"Love the food here!! Masssaman curry is our favourite!! Don't like potatoes that are not cooked soft enough, so I ask for snow peas & mushroom as an alternative... they always are happy to oblige & charge a little extra for that option... find the rice portion is not enough, so always order extra rice, as my husband & I share this meal!!
Love the service & friendliness of staff, yes they are busy, but I'd rather have staff busy than standing around hovering, & charging me extra!!!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good Thai food. Their tom yum soup was awesome, and I love the way they served it -- in giant metal bowls with ladles for the table. The fried tofu appetizer was delicious, but the chicken lettuce wraps were just okay. All of the entrees were yummy, but the basil tofu and pad see ew were the real standouts. Dessert was yummy (fried bananas and honey!), but the ice cream was just okay. Their wine and beer selection isn't extensive, but it was just enough to choose from.

Location is convenient (Sam Furr but not in Birkdale so parking isn't quite so impossible), and ambiance is casual and comfortable."}
{"text":"The food here didn't really taste too much like Thai food, I've been to the country multiple times and I'm still searching for a place that has an authentic Thai taste.

 Tom Yum soup I had was decent, but it had no coconut milk which I always ate it with. The taste was good though. The noodles and other chicken dish was very far from Thai food. It tasted like noodles, chicken and soy sauce, and Chinese food. 

I was pretty disappointed...  But the staff were all very nice. :)"}
{"text":"Not bad, not the best.

The pad thai is pretty spot-on, but the pad see ew and stir fry were a little bland and sauceless. My favorite parts about pad see ew are the noodles (these were decent) and that delicious brown sauce (which was barely there). 

It's not bad, just not excitingly delicious. I'll continue to get take-out from them until I find something better (if I do)."}
{"text":"Food was so-so.  What disturbed me more was the lack of service me and my friend received.  We went early Friday afternoon so the place wasn't busy at all.  The person on the floor all but totally ignored us and only came over if I called her for something.  Too many other options out there for me to go back here."}
{"text":"The food is consistent and always good, and the staff is friendly and accommodating.  I wish they had brown rice in addition to the white rice.  The lunch menu is somewhat basic but covers everyone and they will provide anything from the dinner menu at lunch if asked."}
{"text":"This cute little Thai family restaurant is awesome. Everyone that works there is super nice and warm.  The food was also amazing and the portions was good. I got the drunken noodle and the spring roll appetizer--both tasted delicious!! I will definitely come back again to try something different!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this review relatively short as I solely had lunch.

Interesting choice of decor in the inside, but spacious enough for a private lunch or date. You're usually seated right away during the lunch time rush and I found that a pleasant surprise for the size of the restaurant. I came specifically for the Pad Thai (for reasons more explained below) and once my order was placed, we were served a bowl of tofu soup for an appetizer. I'm not sure if it was part of the meal or a kind gesture, but nothing special. 

The food was delivered at a good pace for my lunch break timing. Decent portion sizes and it was like any other Pad Thai that I've had. Nothing spectacular to entice your tastebuds. Don't expect to be immersed in the streets of Bangkok either. Simply put, it lacks flavor. No crushed coriander, hardly any bean sprouts or red chili peppers to be found. Plenty of scallions and peanuts though. What surprised me the most was the missing hint of lime and fish sauce. Standard rice noodles thrown into the mix too. 

Traditional staple dishes, such as Pad Thai or even Pad See Ew, are simple to cook and shouldn't be cheated of their traditional flavors. If simple dishes such as these are missing their essentials, what else do the cooks \"forget\" to add to the other dishes? I understand that it's offered as a lunch portion and it's relatively light on the pocket, but really? Noodles are cheap and it's easy to make a portion look larger than it is. But is it difficult to reduce the amount of noodles, throw in a little more seasoning and vegetables and still offer it at a decent price? I don't think so as do the other competitors in the area. 

*Service is excellent though."}
{"text":"Stir Fried Thai Basil with Chicken for Lunch Yesterday - 4 yelp stars! 

My Waiter and a lady were taking GREAT care of the whole Dining Room and it was Full!  The Kitchen did a great job with the Speed and Quality!

The Pad Thai looked good and a bunch of tables were getting it!  It had the more Authentic look, less orangey, less sweet looking so I'll be ordering that or the Pad Kee Mao!

2nd Visit 12-3-2012  Pad Kee Mao!  Fantastic!  Cooked to Order, no bamboo shoots and Medium Spicy!  Again very Fast and Accurate Service!  All three of the staff two Ladies one Guy (same as last time) very friendly and appreciative of my return!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I ordered the sesame chicken and then pork fried rice. The pork wasn't very good but I picked it out, bc the rice was awesome. The sesame chicken was crunchy and full of delicious flavor. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, we had pad Thai and red curry which both seemed like they were missing something.  The curry was not very flavorful.  Service was great and all of the workers were really friendly.  Unfortunately we will be trying some other Thai places before we come back."}
{"text":"I'm with Nicole W. on this one... definitely not the best Thai that I've had.  I was pretty disappointed actually.  But, the service was fantastic and friendly.  I went there for dinner on a Sunday night and brought a friend who had never really had Thai before.  This was not really the way that I wanted to introduce it to them, but without having any other Thai food to compare it to, they were pleasantly satisfied.  I wish I had tried their Thai Iced Tea but instead I had the jasmine green tea which was good.  And, they kept filling my cup up so that made me really happy.  Overall, I would give it one more try and order a noodle dish the next time."}
{"text":"Ordered take out.
Cashew beef and sweet and sour chicken.
Best Thai I have ever had!!!
Good customer service and the food was awesome.
Huby and I fought for the last spoons.
Plates wiped out clean.
Will be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"This place is probably the only Thai restaurant I go to when I'm craving it. The curry is just right for me, it hast the right amount of heat and it's still good in flavor. The appetizers are awesome as well. 

Inside, it's nice and spacious. This isn't the best place to watch a game, but an awesome place for a date or a nice night out.

If I had to choose any chinese restaurant or here, this place would get it hands down every single time. This place is a lot more authentic than any \"Chinese\" will ever be.

Come here and enjoy your time!"}
{"text":"So so Thai, not really bad, not really good.  Decent to get my Pad Thai fix in and it is easy to get take out on my way home from work.  I always order the Seafood Pad Thai and its decent, a bit on the pricey side, but it can feed two adults.  The staff is friendly enough and usually the place has a decent amount of people in it."}
{"text":"Was completely unaware that this place existed - it's in a small nook behind the Target shopping center at exit 25 in a newly developed area. 
I ordered take-out by phone. When I arrived, I was surprised that the place was empty, but the staff was warm and friendly. 
Got the food home -- 
Spring rolls. Not the best spring rolls I've had, but definitely good. I think it's the mixture of chicken and shrimp that threw me off. Great deal at 4 for 4.50. They're not small spring rolls that you usually get.
Chicken massumun curry (#55) - delicious! I didn't ask for a spice level, and it was definitely very spicy (I'd guess a four). Expensive at $12? Perhaps, but there was a TON of food - enough for me, my wife and a bit of leftovers for lunch today. 
I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food and service is great. The lunch portion are huge and very reasonably priced. The great thing about this place is there open all day, most Thai places  closes between 230pm til 5 pm."}
{"text":"On another girls lunch excursion we made our way to Thai Emerald based on someone's previous experience and boy am I glad we did! The table started off with a round of Thai Teas (I'm no longer a virgin!) then we were served up some egg drop soup which was also delish. For the main course I went halfsies with a friend and we shared the pineapple friend rice with chicken and green curry with tofu. I totally get why the pineapple is the symbol for \"Welcome\" because the pineapple fried rice was delightfully welcomed to my palette and belly. Sooo yummy! The green curry was wonderful as well, but the fried rice simply stole the show. Another friend had the garlic stir fry, which she kindly let me try. It was like a bulb went off on my tongue, a garlic bulb that is. (See what I did there?) It was intensely flavored, without being unbearable. Service was quick and pleasant and the restaurant itself was squeaky clean which I'm always a fan of. Prices were reasonable and portions were generous. We all walked out with full bellies, satisfied taste buds and another solid place to add to our list of girls lunch out dates."}
{"text":"I work nearby and come here for lunch all the time. The service is always amazing and the food comes out fast and is delicious. They are always on point with the level of spice that you order, which has always been an issue with me at other Thai restaurants. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Last week we had ordered two dishes for dinner take out - the seafood delight and the vegetarian/tofu pad Thai. 

For the seafood delight, there was a decent amount of seafood in it - but not very good quality. Nice variety of veggies, and the noodles at the bottom were pretty good. Just nothing amazing, and probably wouldn't get it again.

For the pad Thai, it was SO sweet! I had to water it down at home, and drain off some of the sauce. I'm also used to pad Thai with thicker noodles, so it was a little different. Again, probably wouldn't get it again :("}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night and it was great!  I've tried several Thai restaurants in the area and Thai Emerald is the best I've tasted.  Very flavorful and the one thing that differentiates them is their curries have more veggies/meat than sauce.  A lot of Thai places serve their curries with a bunch of sauce with a few veggies and meat - my veggie mussamum curry was filled with all sorts of veggies and tofu and just enough of the yummy sauce.  The creamy coconut soup was also great - I could have drank a jug of the broth.  The best version I've tasted in the area.  Great service and very nice atmosphere.  Highly recommend Thai Emerald - we now consider this our go-to Thai place."}
{"text":"I feel that food at a restaurant should be good and worth paying for, this was not an example of that.  I got pad thai, a dish that any thai restaurant should at least put together correctly.  Here are a list of the issues :

- there was no lime with the pad thai (first tip-off of a terrible pad thai)
- there were hardly, if any, sprouts
- the sauce tasted like msg
- there was no egg mixed in
- there was no tofu mixed in
- the pasta was dry, and the entire dish stuck together

Bozena got a dish as well, and it was terrible.  I would rather pay more money for a quality dish.  Charlotte does a terrible job with pacific island and asian food...any ethnic food really.  I am frustrated with the restaurants in this city.  If it isn't friend okra for the 2/3 of the state that is obese, this city can't seem to pull it together.  Whenever I go to NY, Toronto, California, etc, all I do is pig out because I am deprived.  We need to start boycotting restaurants here that don't provide quality meals."}
{"text":"Delicious food, highly recommended. The staff is so nice too and service was quick. The Panang curry is my favorite."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and had to he kra pow. Which is ground chic and vegies with basil. My dish was drowning in sauce, too much sauce. I could taste what I suspected to be msg so I inquired. They do use msg. Thai food traditionally does not contain msg so I didn't bother to ask before ordering. I probably won't be back. Not traditional Thai at all. More like Chinese food. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Grrat lunch specials - including a spring roll. Attentive service. Red curry & Bangkok chicken were both excellent."}
{"text":"My sister and I were looking for good Thai and heard this was the place. This is the ONLY place to go for Thai. We started with Singha Thai beers and lettuce wraps. Those were both wiped out quickly. We ordered Pad Thai and Pineapple fried rice with shrimp. Both dishes were delicious. Between the amazing meal and great service, we will both be back and already spreading the word."}
{"text":"Thai Emerald is a family favorite! The staff is warm and welcoming. We love Pad See Yew, chicken fried rice, hot pot soups, lettuce wraps, and spring rolls. I also love Thai tea and egg and mango sticky rice deserts. Pricing is fair and you get enough food to share amongst a family. My family of 5 normally orders 2-3 different dishes to share."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and moderate pricing.

I had the Vegetable Fresh Rolls and the Tofu Pad Prikh Khing. The Pad Prikh Khing had a pinch of coconut milk the sauce, which I'm not use to, but other than that it was fantastic. They allow you to choose between 1-5 for a spiciness scale and the 3 wasn't as spicy as I had hoped it to be.

The environment is relaxing, given its location, and they do a good job making you forget you're in a giant corporate plaza."}
{"text":"Very generic Thai food.  No atmosphere.  Went there for lunch and was disappointed I didn't go to Thai Basil Leaf down the street."}
{"text":"Great service, and a reasonably priced lunch in a clean environment reason for three stars- but the food fell short for me. 

I went with the Panang curry with chicken per Yelp recommendation and didn't find it to be very good. In fact it tasted similarly to what I would make at home and this is NOT a complement ...this type of cooking is not my forte. 

I wish the vegetables (other than the mushrooms which were) were fresh not the frozen squares of carrots. The chicken was a little meh in my opinion too. The worst part was the spring roll which was completely out of a freezer...in fact, I've had better freezer versions sadly. It was salty, mushy, and it would serve them better to not include it in the meal and to spring (no pun intended) for fresh veggies instead. 

I probably won't be back to Thai Emerald sadly."}
{"text":"I stopped by Thai Emerald on Thanksgiving eve as I was making my way driving down to Atlanta. While I was only getting take outs I was quite surprised to see the place was quite busy an hour before it closes on Thanksgiving eve. I was quickly greeted by the friendly staff and placed my orders in promptly. They're definitely very quick as I didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes before the food were ready. This is while the restaurant already had like 6-7 tables of patrons to wait on. I quite like how quick their service is.

The food wasn't much different from what you find in a typical Thai place. I was pretty famished so just went with the basics for speed and convenience. The price the portions were quite generous single order for me is enough for 2-3 meals, the food were pretty good although probably not very authentic Thai as it tasted sweeter than what I'm usually used to. Definitely more geared toward the American locals in the areas I would say. I find the curry to be more my liking although I personally would prefer softer potatoes. But the curry sauce was quite well done and I really liked they added some chili peppers to the curry.

I thought the place was a bit hard to find for a first timer. The strip malls here were quite numerous and took me a while to actually see the sign, but once you see it its easier to navigate through the parking lot.

Normally when I pass through I-77 I stop by the pho place but it looks like this would be a nice alternative :)"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and authentic.  The service was friendly and very attentive.  The restaurant is clean and modern.  We will definitely make this our new and favorite Thai restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"For me, Thai Emerald gets an A for effort, but a C for execution. Upon walking in for lunch during the weekday I was promptly greeted by a very sweet woman who immediately led me to a booth. The lunch menu was pretty standard and straightforward...no big surprises here. The interior of the restaurant was less than impressive...a bit clinical, but let's be honest, I was there to try out the food. 

I ordered the Pad Thai and I was pleasantly surprised that my meal came with a free soup and spring roll. While I appreciate the generosity, I wasn't a fan of either. The spring roll was fried and a bit chewy and the soup was nondescript. As for my meal, it came out in less than five minutes - no joke - extremely quick service. As for the Pad Thai itself - it was just ok. There was very little flavoring and the noodles were a bit gummy. 

I really wished the meal was great, because the service was extremely friendly and quick and the portions were enough to feed me for days. While I may try Thai Emerald again, I would really only be returning because of the fantastic, fast service. If you head out to Thai Emerald and order the Pad Thai, make sure you order it extra spicy - you'll want some extra flavor."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. They are super quick and the lunch specials are a great deal with soup and a spring roll included. The staff is so friendly and after just a few visits they remembered us and made us feel like regulars. The Pad Thai is great, and I also recommend the Thai basil chicken or Bangkok chicken."}
{"text":"Asking for spicy will get very spicy! Wasn't the best, but wasn't terrible. Not somewhere I would go back."}
{"text":"I had been walking right past this place for years when getting Subway. I never entered because the outside of it is very dark. You can't see inside at all unless you press your face up against the window. I didn't do that because it would be weird if someone was eating their soup on the other side of the window. 

I entered with my son, not knowing what to expect. I was a little excited because it was going to be my first Thai experience (not just for food). 

As as far as the food goes, they gave us some kind of complementary soup, but it wasn't really for us. We called it Mush Soup. Then we ordered Sesame Chicken with carrots and white rice. Solid performance. I ate my whole plate and half of my son's plate. 

The service was fast and friendly and the place is impeccably clean. The menu options don't really fit my palate so it it won't be a regular spot for me, but it might be worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Thai Emerald is located in the new Northcross extension (it is kind of hidden...located in the back area toward the Target).  

Atmosphere - The inside of this restaurant is low key and a little sterile.  The dining area is relatively open w/ mint colored paint aimed to calm and relax you (at least that is what I was told when I asked someone why the color is used in the painting of so many grade school rooms).  Wait staff here wear clean black polo shirts and dress slacks.

Food - I have eaten from Thai Emerald several times via take-out as the place is somewhat close to my home.  I usually get and enjoy their Yum Neua (grilled sliced beef w/ cucumbers, red onions, chili, tomatoes served in a lemon-lime chili sauce) and their Pad Med Mamuang (chicken w/ cashew nuts, carrots, baby corn, snow peas, and straw mushroom).  I have also tried but was less impressed with the Gaeng Keow Wan (chicken w/ green curry in coconut milk with lemongrass, bamboo shoots, carrots, green beans, bell peppers, and basil leaves).  I found the Yum Neua and Pad Med Mamuang very tasty as the sliced steak was good and tender and the spice in the Pad to be perfect.  The Gaeng Keow Wan on the other hand was a little less enjoyable as it had green beans instead of the peas noted on the menu, w/ the overall flavor of the dish a little bland.  For desert I have had their Sangkaya (sticky rice sweetened w/ coconut milk syrup topped w/ green (?) egg custard) and their Rambutan stuffed w/ Pineapples (are you really reading what is in rambutan stuffed w/ pineapples??).  The first dessert, Sangkaya, was odd in appearance and tasted so-so.  The Rambutan w/ Pineapple was a little too sweet for me as it appeared to be from canned rambutan.         

Service - Like I stated above, take-out has been my experience.  Though the people taking the calls and at the front desk when I arrive are always courteous and helpful.

Overall - Since the other Thai restaurant in Huntersville closed, Thai Emerald has become my default restaurant for a quick tasty meal during the week.  It had been my second choice prior to the close of Thai Café but not because of the food.  It was just because Thai Emerald was a slightly more in price (gosh, I am cheap).  

Now go to Thai Emerald, so this one does not close too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!!!   OMGosh this food is delicious!  I have not tried anything here that is not really good.  So happy to have this place near by. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Thai Emerald twice. once with a friend from Japan. We were there at lunch and had the specials. EVERYONE at our table loved what we had and we shared because the portions are so plentiful and yummy. My wife and I ate lunch there by ourselves and once again had the specials and we bought food home.  I just read a review from some guy who gave the place a one star and said that he can only get good food in NYC or Toronto. BS. Some folks want their fleeting moment of fame by writing long, ill spirited reviews of restaurants. WHY ARE YOU LIVING HERE?  I have had Thai food in Thailand and this is very good food adapted to American tastes."}
{"text":"Also one of my favorite places to eat in huntersville. My husband often take lunch dates here and awesome take out. Staff is always friendly and even remember our order."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I have ever had but thus far the best I have found in the area. The service was polite and nice. The food was good.  I am still looking for some great Pad Thai but thus far this is the best I have found in the area. Wish they had things like Pineapple fried rice and thai wanton soup but we enjoyed out visit"}
{"text":"To be upfront about it, this is a pretty basic and typical Thai restaurant. The interior isn't bad but seems a bit worn and the staff are friendly and seem very hard at work, bustling around tending to both customers in the restaurant and takeout orders. However, the food is somewhat lackluster and the menu is exactly the standard presentation of Thai American where you have the exact same curries and specials as probably three fourths of Thai restaurants across the nation. At that, my larb salad with chicken was only decent and not in any way remarkable. The prices though are fair and if you're easily pleased with your Thai food you may find this place a good choice. To me, it's three stars, the reason is there isn't anything amiss or wrong with Thai Emerald but nothing to distinguish it amongst its competitors either."}
{"text":"I use to go here often, until I realized that they do not care about their customers besides a very pleasant guy that works there whom I believe is the son of the owners. The past two times I visited this restaurant my servers were extremely rude, rushed me, and scoffed at my questions. One of the lady's ignored me completely and gave me something completely different. The food was very bland, over cooked, and cold. This is definitely not an authentic Thai restaurant and it is also overpriced. I will never return to this place. They need to care more about their customers, food presentation, and the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I haven't had much experience with Thai food. I was first exposed to it at Blue Spice in Albany, NY, and it was AMAZING! We enjoyed the restaurant so much that I never had a desire to venture out and try other Thai restaurants. Fast forward to the fact that I am now a resident of North Carolina, and we were craving Thai. We found that Thai Emerald was pretty close to us so we headed there for lunch one day.

The restaurant was clean and well kept. We were immediately greeted by a very friendly hostess, and all the waitstaff was very friendly. While one server took our order others came by to fill water, drop off food and clear the empty plates. I think most, if not all, of the lunch items come with a bowl of soup and a spring roll to start with. The soup was a very plain broth-based soup with some egg in it, and it was pretty good. With the egg, and the egg flavor infused in the broth, it was a little rich, but I enjoyed it for the most part. The spring roll is more like a mini roll, and if you didn't care for social graces you could probably polish it off in one bite. The roll was nothing special, and I have definitely had better rolls elsewhere, but I guess that's what you can expect from a free spring roll.

The lunch menu (which isn't posted on their site, though the dinner menu is) is basically a selection of different dishes where you pay based on what kind of meat you choose (or tofu/ vegetarian if that's what you're thing is) and what kind of dish you want. It seemed like they had a selection of different items from their dinner menu that were offered as a smaller portion for lunch.  I ordered the Gaeng Kua curry with pork, which was a red curry with pineapples and some other veggies. It was pretty tastetacular, and I loved the pineapple mixing with the hot spiciness of the curry. It wasn't too hot where it burned going down, but it was spicy enough to give my snoz a small case of the runs. My wife ordered the Pad Thai with the vegeterian option (though she 86'd the tofu). She really enjoyed it, and when I snagged a bite I whole-heartedly agreed. I also have to say that not only is the food great, but the portions were huge! There was so much that I didn't finish mine (and that rarely happens) and my wife had so much leftovers that there was enough for her to have lunch for two more days! If what we ate was the lunch portion, I would love to see what they consider the dinner portion.

All in all, it was a very good Thai experience. I don't want to make the same mistake we did in Albany by making this our go-to Thai place, and I definitely want to \"shop around\" to see which restaurant in the area serves up the best Thai, but I know I'll be coming back here again at some point."}
{"text":"Updating my review based on last night. Wow, we came in at 8:30pm for dinner and the second we walked in, we were told \"our kitchen is closing soon so you can order IF you know what you want now.\" I asked what time they close, and the woman said 9pm. Okay, half an hour to go, so I said if we can still order and that would be okay. The woman was like \"Fine\" and the ENTIRE time, she wouldn't even let us finish a sentence before cutting us off and leaving the table. Mind you, there were a couple of other tables still there and she did the same to them. She was PUSHING us out the door (literally) the entire meal. She asked how the food was, and before we could even respond she said \"okay good\" and walked away. We left with 10 minutes to spare before 9 (a full dinner meal in 20 min???) and they were mopping the floors with a strong Clorox bleach smell so I just wanted to leave. We packed up our food and left. 

I had previously enjoyed this place, but I won't be coming back after that. Don't open a business and treat your customers like we're bothering you."}
