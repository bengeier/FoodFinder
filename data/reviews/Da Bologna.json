{"text":"Best subs in Montreal! The pizza is also excellent and more NY style than napolitani style pizza. It's not a pretentious place and the quality of the food is what keeps people coming back after all these years."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza last month in my opion it was one of the best I've eaten in a long time. Looking forward to eating there one day."}
{"text":"A few weeks back I was in Montreal for the Formula 1 race.  If you have been to Montreal you know that the amount of great food places is insane.  The places that you want to visit are the hidden gems and let me tell you Da Bologna is just that.  Its in Montreal North hidden in a small area surrounded with homes and small shops.  When approaching this place from the outside you might think twice about going inside.  If that crosses your mind DONT LISTEN to your self.  If the line up to get in doesn't give it away then please take my advise.  This place is awesomeeee.  I ordered the pizza of course which is what they are known for and let me tell you I could not find anything wrong with it even if I wanted to.  My biggest problem was trying not to steal my friends sub sandwich that is made from the pizza dough.  That looked amazing also.  Pizza is heavy on the toppings and cooked to perfection.  Please make sure to call for a reservation and even still be prepared to wait but its well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Da Bologna est véritablement le bijou de Montréal-Nord en matière de fast-food. Situé sur la rue Charleroi, ce restaurant offre toute une variété de sous-marin, de pizza, de pâtes et même de pizza-burger, une spécialité tout à fait délicieuse qui devrait être exportée. Les frites et les rondelles d'oignons sont très bonnes et faites sur place. En fait, tout sur le menu est très bon. Il faut simplement prévoir de l'argent en espèce pour payer, car ni les cartes de débits ni les cartes de crédits ne sont acceptés."}
{"text":"Tried this pizzeria for the first time today and I was blown away!!!! My friend has been going here for years & I'm sad it took him this long to introduce me to the most an amazing sub. Easily top 3 in my lifetime. The bread they use which is made from their own pizza dough is cooked well done with burnt ends and very crispy. What happens is you get hot bread with the hot filling which they are very generous with. The place is a out of date from the outside but when the sign reads open since 1958 it's a no brainer in my opinion. Well worth the detour."}
{"text":"A Montreal-North institution. I remember growing up in MTL-North and enjoying their amazing pizzas and subs. They still are amazing. Came here on a Saturday night with the guys and had to wait 20 minutes for a table but it was of course worth the wait.  I have to admit it has been a few years since I've been here. It was a little hole in the wall but they have renovated it nicely and now accept reservations.  Our usual waitress, Sophie, took great care of us. We ordered our subs (Bologna special for me, Steak, Steak and more Steak sub for buddy #1) while my other bud had a veal parm. All served hot and delicious. Such a treat to eat here. Never had one bad dish or service. They really take pride in their food and it shows. Ordered a small bacon pizza to go since my wife never had Bologna. She really enjoyed it! Oh before I forget try their onion rings, really crunchy and yummy.  Now fair warning to all. It is an Italian family style restaurant. It is loud, loud loud. It makes Elios pizzeria sound like a church. So just letting you know that no, there is not a huge fight happening in the resto, it is just us Italians enjoying conversation :-)"}
{"text":"I have been ordering pizza here for years and there's a reason why. There pizzas are well cooked and the crust is the way I like it, a little crispy and a little chewy. You can also ask them to cook it more or less depending on your preference.  On a Saturday night this place gets filled really fast, it's great for family parties. The only down side is this place is a little bit small and the last time I had my pizza I felt the cheese was a tad too salty, I would have gave it a 5 star rating. Anyway if you go take the Mercedes pizza... Absolutely delicious"}
