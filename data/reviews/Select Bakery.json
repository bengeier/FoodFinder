{"text":"Breads and sweets are very nice and staff is very friendly and helpful. The one thing that I don't like is when you buy sweets and they put them in their fancy box with their name on it they charge you for the box!!  If you buy tulumbes (not sure if I spelled it right) the box at $14 per kg comes out to $1. You add that up over a month of buying treats from their and your spending $20-$25 on stupid boxes.   Asked the owner why he doesn't put a tare on the weigh scales for the boxes and he basically said if you don't like it go somewhere else! So I did, bye bye :)"}
{"text":"Select Bakery is a great little Euro/Greek bakery in York. I try to stop there every time I'm in the area, which is about 3-4 times a year.   Their baclava is truly as good as my old nextdoor neighbor's (she was from Greece).   They also have a ton of other delicious pastries that I'm not going to even attempt to spell! Just trust what the people there suggest and I guarantee you'll be satisfied.   High praise as I love this bakery!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have this large Greek Bakery in my neighborhood! It's a handy place to pick up items like yogurt, cheese, cold cuts, olives, sea salt, pasta, etc.  That being said, it could be better. For example, all of thier breads are rustic, old world-style loaves. They're quite crusty, and even after its been sliced, it hurts the corners of your mouth when you bite into a sandwich. Not that it's bad bread - it tastes great! It's just frustrating because they have SO many types of bread, yet none of them have a soft crust. I wish they made just one light rye or sourdough or white sandwich bread for their non-Greek customers - they'd really expand their clientele.  Same thing with the pastries. They're not bad - they're very authentic. Greek pastry cream tastes very different from French or Italian, the style most Torontonians are used to. It tastes fine with their Greek pastries, but when they use the same Greek-style filling in cupcakes or macarons, it tastes strange. I avoid all of those pastries.   Again, if they made only a few great items in a style that non-Greek customers are used to, they'd do so well! There are no other good bakeries in this affluent, young, residential neighborhood. Most families go all the way to Coxwell for an after-dinner treat.  The best desserts at Select are the ones closer to the cash register, at eye-level. Everything in that display is delicious and well worth trying!  All in all, this I'm really happy that Select Bakery is so close to my home, but just like every other business on that Donlands strip, it has the potential to be SO much better."}
{"text":"Best baklava ever!!! I first tried their baklava years ago as I got a box from friends that came over to visit... Since then, I've tried baklava from many places and it's never been as good as select bakery. Whenever I'm in the area I make sure to get some... It might even be worth the 40min drive over from my place ;)"}
{"text":"It's rare to get bread that isn't still warm out of the oven here. Their chocolate-dipped baklava and rice pudding are the best!"}
{"text":"Best Greek deserts in the city!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I walk in here there are lots of goodies.  I always wonder how they keep it all so fresh!  Today I bought a loaf of bread for $1.75.  The grocery store is $3.99.  I think this is definitely a win as well as I love supporting my neighbourhood business."}
{"text":"Under every normal circumstance i would have given this bakery a 4 or 5 but as i went in today and asked for a specific product which they refused to sell me because of their \"display\".   Had i gone into any other bakery and asked for a specific cake/cupcake or piece of dessert they would have given to me but the front lady and baker REFUSED and not only that but the baker was condescending and talked down to me as if i were an idiot.   Maybe had their not been visual a visual difference i wouldn't have been so picky but as you can see by the picture there was a difference in quality (old versus fresh)   I will never step foot in here especially considering i can make this stuff myself at home but didn't want to be bothered making huge batches"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area when I spotted this bakery. Decided to try it as I had heard good things. Everything I heard was accurate. The interior was very pleasing, the staff helpful and friendly and most importantly, the deserts were amazing.   Chocolate covered baklava, Nutella macarons and triple chocolate mousse. Even took home some Greek Easter bread. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This neck of the woods is so underrepresented on Yelp.  But here's another hidden gem of a euro bakery!  It's a classic Greek bakery offering a variety of yummie, omnomerific goodness.  There's a HUGE selection of pastries, cakes, and cookies including standard fare such as baklavas.  They're so yummie and sweet, I swear my teeth want to jump out on the spot.  The key is the quality honey and dough that they use.   Seriously not going to find many better places it.  But here's a little secret.  I'm usually here for the Nutella filled chocolate covered cookies.  When I want to \"be the man\" at a party, I bring over a box of these crispy, melt in your mouth cookie candies.  Once these get unveiled and the ladies sample one, everyone wants to go home with me after.  I'm not sure what they put into these, but I swear it's better than ecstasy.  Giggidy giggdy!"}
{"text":"No doughuts but excellent selection of Greek groceries..went in for doughnuts and came out with feta, olives and custard pie!!!! Excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"We always get our Greek pastries from here. In particular the mini baklava are our favourite. Staff are very helpful and friendly. A neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"This grocery shop is away from the greek danforth  street but now is the best for greek groceries in toronto. We bought spinach and cheese pies, feta cheese and olives. All were excellent and inexpensive. They have lots of pastries as well as greek groceries. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"No question that the food here is great.  First rate.  But the service can be bad.  Prepare to be ignored.  I keep coming back because of the quality of the food, but am generally prepared to wait because the staff will just look right through me.  I become invisible trying to get service at Select Bakery.  But, as I said, really good baked goods."}
{"text":"The Greek baked goods are delicious! Cinnamon ring and Apple turnover are my favs.  It's more of a take out place but they do have couple of dozen seats by the front window where you can just sit and enjoy your baked goods with tea or coffee which they also sell.   -- Parking -- Free parking in front after 6pm. Meter parking of $3 @ 1/2 hr 9am to 6pm.   Be aware, the meter cop likes to come around 5:30pm to give parking tickets to anyone parked there without having bought a parking from the machines."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend to try their Deli Sandwiches, the meat is so fresh and tastes really yummy. The Service is good and friendly. The traditional greek sweets are also very delicious.  You can also find here some greek groceries."}
{"text":"Love this bakery on Donlands near O'Connor.  They have a great selection of baked goods --- cakes, all kinds of cookies (those great butter ones), and Greek pastries (wonderful baklava and lots of different kinds too).  Try out the pastries too --- fancy ones of all kinds.    You can get some other Greek grocery type goods as well. Very reasonable too, and lots of choices.   The hubby loved the Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse, and I love the Orange Baba.  Parking is right in front on the street."}
{"text":"I ordered a strawberry shortcake for my moms surprise birthday party. Select bakery did such a wonderful job with a shortish- notice request. The cake was not only beautiful, but really fresh and tasty! I would recommend this bakery for any large cake order as they are affordable and the quality is great. The order process was very smooth - customer service was friendly and responded to emails quickly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Select is a cultural overload. From the moment you step through those large glass doors into the overwhelming piles of European (specifically Greek) pastries, fridges, and assorted canned goods, it's a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory kind of experience.   Aside from culturally specific items, they also have great cakes that range between $24-30 and unbelievable Greek pastries. The baklava is divine and the loukoumades actually don't taste as disgustingly sweet as the ones on the Danforth. Speaking from personal experience, their cakes are packaged in a sturdy box that can survive a 2 hour trek on foot, subway and bus.   Service can be slow on a Friday afternoon or on the weekends, but the girls behind the counter hustle, and you can tell.   The bonus is watching old Greek couples yell out orders in Greek and bicker with each other, or when the girls get recognized by family friends. Cultural tourism aside, their baked goods are really the most reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"The eclairs and whatever these hazelnut / cinnamon macaroons were unlike anything I've ever tasted. Sooo amazing! I'm almost glad I don't live close because it would be deadly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been in here quite a few times over the years and probably went up a few pant sizes because of it. Glad it's on a crappy bus route or i would have to wear track pants by now.   They have an ample choice of pastries, cookies, bread and a pretty sizable olive bar. The place is super clean and the staff is pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in the neighbourhood, I make it a point to come here and get their baklava."}
{"text":"A really great, old-school Greek bakery.  Worth the short drive north from the Danforth.  Parking can be tricky Saturday afternoons and Sundays after church, but always worth it.  The desserts are always reliably good, the breads are fine, love love love the little containers of baked custard, but the absolute star of the show for me - the sesame rings - like the outside of a perfect Montreal bagel without the innards.   $0.40 a piece (I'd pay more for sure) - hard to stop snacking on them.   Warmed up at home with sweet butter and some cherry or plum preserves on the side, they're better than any cake."}
{"text":"Last night agapi mou (my Greek lovah) brought over two boxes of fresh goodies from Select Bakery. Each box must have weighed 3lbs as they were filled with extremely fresh honey soaked goodies.  The loukoumades here were the best I've ever had! They were like \"mini\" loukoumades (loukoumadakia) only the size of a quarter or so. They were soaked heavily in honey.  I also tried TOULOUBES for the first time, which were a tube-shape piece of fried dough soaked in the honey liquid. These were the sweetest Greek treat I've tried yet, completely ridiculous.   Honourable mentions for the baklava, kadafia, galaktoboureko (custard pie) and melomakarona (honey walnut macaroons).  They also seem to sell everything in a chocolate dipped variety as well. Clap clap.  6 hours later I fell into a deep honey-induced coma-like sleep. I'm going to the gym later today."}
{"text":"Update.  I generally have had good experiences here and one that wasn't as good as usual.  Thankfully my recent experiences have been positive and I look forward to some lovely greek pastries."}
