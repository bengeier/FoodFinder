{"text":"Food was decent. Service sucked cheese curds. Go next door to Pizza Hut.  Coming from out of town,we wanted a true WI Irish pub experience. Didn't get that. Beer was warm and the environment was dead."}
{"text":"Had a veggie wrap and started feeling sick on the way home. How does one even get food poisoning from a veggie wrap and some fruit slices? Well O'Grady pulled that off. Food tasted ok but others in our family also had food poisoning after eating here.  The waitress was very elusive and I had to go and find my own hot sauce.   All in all a mediocre dining experience and a miserable 36 hours afterwards- from a veggie wrap. I hate this place."}
{"text":"stopped by this place for a quick beer and what did i find on the menu, to my delight?  cheese curds... the girls working the front desk at my hotel kept raving about the local fried cheese curds...   fried cheese curds are similar to mozzarella sticks but they're not.  i don't want to get into a long explanation involving texture and taste so to keep it short and sweet, it's fried cheese, dude.. what more can you ask for?  the service was great and local beers were pretty good.  try the spotted cow."}
{"text":"My wife and I've been to O'Grady's a number of times now. We've always had great service and food. From the fish fry to the wraps we've always been happy. Highly recommend checking them out! We will be back."}
{"text":"O'Grady's is wonderful. Very cozy and service is excellent. Great drink specials and really good deserts."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much and that's basically what I got. Bar food and slow service."}
{"text":"Have been their twice in the last 6 weeks. The food was just fine. Had appetizers the first time and burgers the next. No complaints."}
{"text":"OMG...the service was HORRIBLE.  The food mediocre.  The server was NOT busy.  Stopped by for sandwich on Sunday mid afternoon...so not busy.  There was one one other table besides ours.  We ordered club pub sandwiches.  The order came up and sat on the hot table while our server texted and talked to co workers.   She finally served us, without napkins or flat ware.  I had to go to these bar to ask for napkins and a knife.  OMG, \"here you go, I will give you a knife AND A FORK...\" novel concept!  Then we requested a diet coke, and because she was so BUSY texting and talking on her phone, Moshe forgot.  We sat there for at least 25 min before she came back to the table.  The other party wanted another glass of wine, but she never came back to check so needless to say, we got no diet coke and not another glass of wine.  Upon finishing our sandwiches, she stated oh, I guess you are done.  Never asked if we wanted anything else (I wanted another glass of wine, my companion still had not received her diet coke), but we chose to leave since she was so BUSY on her phone texting and calling other people.  She offered to give us a \"go diet coke\", but never addressed the additional glass of wine.  I will NEVER go back again.  Don't know if they changed management or what, but the place and service SUCKS.  GO SOMEWHERE that is reputable and good service.  They employ the s um of the earth with more ink on their body than on the menu!"}
{"text":"First of all, I don't know why there are two of these on Yelp when there definitely only needs to be one. Anyway, we went for the fish fry and it was really good! Nice breading, very light and crispy. The fries are out of this world! I forgot how good they were so I ordered the hash browns which were only okay. I do have to wonder why they don't give you seconds on the sides during their all you can eat Friday fish fry. It seems that it would be cheaper to dole out fries as well as fish since potatoes are cheaper than seafood. Anyway, not sure why it's not rated higher. I'm definitely willing to go again!"}
{"text":"PLEASE IF YOU ARE GOING TO CALL YOURSELF A $#$#@#$ IRISH PUB, SERVE IRISH FOOD ON MORE THAN JUST WEDNESDAYS. THANK YOU.  Also - our server did not know ANYTHING about the menu. Her exact words were, \"I don't know anything about the food, I just serve it\". All I asked was if their ravioli were made fresh or frozen, and my fiance' asked if their French fries still had the skin on them. She didn't know the answer to either question, and she didn't offer to go find out.  Thankfully, I avoided the ravioli, but my fiance' ordered the fries anyway... and they came - with skins on.  So I ordered the rib eye, rare... it came perfect. Ordered with it, a bowl of clam chowder (was home-made, yes, but under seasoned & tasted like a cream soup with clams instead of a clam chowder). I took a side of fresh fruit... what I got was 1 slice of pineapple... 2 slices of cantaloupe that were not ripe.. and 2 dried out orange slices... quite depressing.  My fiance' ordered the grilled cheese w/fries - again, fries came with skins on, so she had them sent back and asked for the fruit... she got more pineapple than I did, but her orange slices were dry, and her cantaloupe was not ripened enough."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad drinks, bad atmosphere... Very dark space, doesn't seem cleanly. Did not have a good experience"}
{"text":"Service was solid, and food was priced reasonably.  Spinach artichoke dip was tasty but that's where things went wrong. Mandarin chicken salad tasted funky, Mike's beef wrap was dry and strange. Not impressed by the food, but everything else was on par with what should be expected.  Bathrooms were clean though."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE...the \"staff\" is the worst I have ever experienced in my lifetime; I hope you enjoy the loud and foul language from the bar area while you and your family are enjoying your microwaved dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for a couple after work drinks and a quick bite to eat with some friends. It was very meh. We were there around 6 on a Tuesday and the place was pretty dead. The happy hour drink specials were alright, but nothing spectacular. My friends only ordered beers so I can't comment on how strong they make their drinks.   I had a cheeseburger with waffle fries. The burger was decent. The bun was nice and the meat to cheese to bun ratio was good. The waffle fries were very disappointing. There seemed to be more batter than potato or something and they were overly crisp and dry. They were supposed to be seasoned as well, but I couldn't taste anything special.   The bartender was friendly, but when we moved to a table to eat, the waitress was a bit over attentive. I get that the place was slow, but you don't need to ask us every 2 minutes if we are ready to order and then reach across in front of people still eating to remove other people's plates."}
{"text":"First time I went there I ordered a Reuben and was it was served with roast beef, the waitress and manager insisted it was corned beef.  The table next to us ordered a Reuben and the same server told them they were out of corned beef.  I was refused a refund or another menu item.  The server had the audacity to ask why we didn't tip her when we paid the bill.  This type of service I have found typical of many Madison restaurants, the owner is never there and the place is staffed with teenagers.  Second visit I was dragged along with some employees for Taco Tuesday, for the price it was decent but I won't go back there.  S K I P   T H I S   P L A C E."}
{"text":"Better local option then Chili's.  Probably kid friendly early in the dinner hour."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed coming here, especially for St. Patrick's Day shenanigans. The food is your typical bar food... burgers, fries, cheese curds... you know, the essentials. Decently priced. Friendly bartenders and wait staff - I've never had any issues with that like other reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Two words. Not irish. It was a dive bar with dive bar food. I ordered a side of fruit here with my meal and I'm about 99% sure it was all fruit they took from the bar. All of it looked like it could be placed on the rim of my glass. The only good thing here was the cheese curds.  I agree with Ben.. a former review... if you go here expecting run of the mill.. you'll be happy. I however, was hoping for an Irish pub.. no luck there."}
{"text":"Stopped on a whim and was pretty sad I did. The atmosphere is nice, decent lunch crowd going. The spinach artichoke app was good and included carrots and celery which was nice. Looking to eat light we got a mandarin salad and a beef wrap. Neither were anything to write home about. Onion rings were winners as well as $2 screwdriver special."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with the general consensus of this place, average food, average to poor service. Unless you are a regular or a friend of the bartender, he/she won't give you the time of day. Also, very unfriendly bartenders. The only reason I occasionally stop in is because it's so close to home."}
{"text":"The highlight of our O'Grady's run was Michelle; Michelle is definitely one of my favorite waitresses of all time. That said, everything else about our dinner tonight was pretty darn good too.  The decor is generic for a sportsbar, but the atmosphere is relaxing and very home-y. Our romantic people-watching booth on the upper-level probably helped drive my opinion higher than the average patron's... But  trying to be level-headed here, I still think it really is a nice place to hang out. Prices were pretty much what I expected or a bit cheaper than expected across the board; Menu was pretty much your standard pub fair with some flair and special items here and there - Just what the lively 20-something-year-old needs!  We ordered a Bypass sandwich meal - a 5 oz. chicken breast, fried egg, 2 strips of bacon, and cheddar cheese piled between two whole grilled cheese sandwiches! (Yes, grilled cheese sandwiches replaced the buns...) The meal also came with a side and waffle fries were an option! Naturally, waffle fries were our pick. When it arrived BabyCakes and I admired for a few seconds. After she tried to take a full bite (and failed, seriously, ain't nobody got a mouth big enough for that!) we completely dismantled this behemoth of a sandwich and diveyed up the components. All was good: the chicken, the egg, the cheese, the bacon! The grilled cheese sandwiches were a bit thin, but they were by far better than any normal boring \"buns\" that have ever come with a sandwhich. Seasoned waffle fries were warm, crisp, and flavorful just as expected.:) Bravo  My only regret is that we didn't finish; We left 3 waffle fries behind. Michelle tried to boost our spirits with a peptalk, pointing out that 90% is an \"A\" and we had completed well over 90% of the meal. I appreciated the peptalk, but do hope to finish up next time we split a plate that is typically intended for 1, lol."}
{"text":"Am still trying to get the metallic taste of the special meatloaf out of my mouth.  I would never eat at this craphole if you paid me.  Ugh.  Anyone who posts a positive review of this dump has no taste buds."}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch at O'Grady's once a week for the past several years.  The food is excellent and very reasonably priced.  This is a family owned and operated business with long-term employees.  Bartender April and waitress Steph are always friendly and provide great service.   Just a great neighborhood \"Cheers bar\" type of place.  If you want something other than the chain restaurants for lunch you will find great value at Martin O'Grady's."}
{"text":"So much hatred for this place!  I though, will always know it as the first place we ate when we visited Madison.  It's definitely a hole in the wall, though by the signage all over the place, I could envision it getting pretty busy on the weekends and at night (we went for a mid-week lunch at 2 o'clock in the afternoon).  The food was OK - I had a salad and we tried fried cheese curds for the first time.  It's just cheese, apparently, that's been fried.  Somehow I had been expecting more.  Unfortunately, the service was not great.  There were about 4 tables worth of people in there, and it still took forever to get everything."}
{"text":"A bar like O'Grady's is what happens when a drunk makes the misguided decision to open a bar to support his habit: bad food, poor service, overpriced beer and an overall indifference to customers."}
{"text":"Probably the WORST place to eat or go out to on the West side of Madison.  The food is horrible and the service is even worse on top of the \" late night\" customers this place wildly unsafe. ( the shooting last month speaks for itself)  Dont bother stopping here it's  disgusting"}
{"text":"I like the location as it's easy to spot off of Mineral Point Road. However it didn't seem very Irish to me. The food seems hit or miss. I do have to say I enjoyed the waffle fries. The service always seems to be lacking and it always smells like bleach and wet wood chips inside. Not sure I would go back...."}
{"text":"I like this place but the food wasn't so good for lunch this time. I had a caeser rollup with chicken that was one of the worse I have had in the Madison area. First bite I find that there are croutons rolled up in there that sort of cut the roof of my mouth. I have never seen that before. The chicken cubes (yuck) were sort of mixed in with the dressing and were overpowering because there was way too much dressing. I ate half and left the rest. Not a good rollup. My companion had a chefs salad that was much better and I wish I would have ordered that instead of the rollup. It was man sized with plenty of the usual stuff including a hard boiled eggs. The service was very good and the food came quickly. I would try it again but this time was not the greatest."}
{"text":"A nice clean sports bar.   For lunch had the grilled cajun tuna sandwich, the special, with hash browns.   The Cajun spice was understated, but this is the Midwest and one would not expect real spicy food. It came with a spicy mayo on the side. the mayo was interesting but not what I consider Cajun. The sandwich was good just not Cajun. The hash browns were homemade and very good.  The service at noon was good. The waiter did everything that I expected from a waiter.  I thought the pricing was in line for a Madison eating establishment."}
{"text":"I had the special (a chicken sandwich) and it was okay.  I've only been once and it seemed a little pricey...but I could be wrong.  I will probably head back sometime though.  Good place to play Trivia on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I've always really enjoyed this place. Their fish fry is SO good and is \"all you can eat.\"  So many places with a good fish fry in the Madison area have a super long wait on a Friday night.  I have never had to wait for a table at O'Grady's for longer than 10 minutes, and most of the time there's no wait at all.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I like that this is one of only a handful of locally owned places available on the west side; the clam chowder is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 10 times in the past 5 years, typically only to drink.  There aren't a lot of options to grab a quick, quiet drink in this area, unless you're looking for franchise restaurant, which is why I keep coming back.  I certainly don't come here for the service.  It seems to be the same bartender every time I'm there.  She takes her sweet time doing every aspect of her job; greeting people, pouring drinks, and returning for refills or the check.  What bothers me about this is that the bar is tiny, most of the space is for dining.  She also, very openly, sits on her phone with her back to the bar.  She also seems to be eating in front of everyone every time I'm there too.  The prices are average for beer but liquor seems to be quite pricey.    While I don't believe I've ever eaten there, I won't start now.  I find this place to be dark, dirty and outdated.  I think it's supposed to be an Irish bar but I don't see much to support it.  The bathrooms were pretty gross as well.  I noticed that the outside of the building recently got a face lift but apparently Martin O'Grady's didn't feel the need to give their space a good scrub-down to match.  There's that whole 'someone-got-murdered-in-the-parking-lot' thing too....."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in quite a while and now I remember why.  I stopped in for a late Saturday lunch (1:45ish.)    There were customers, but they were not swamped by any means.  The service was terrible!  Other than take my order and bring the food, that was the extent I saw the wait staff.  No refills of a drink, no asking how the food was, and I tracked them down for the tab.  (Maybe I should have know when the table near me was missing the blue cheese on their Black n' Bleu burger.)  At first I thought maybe it was just me, but while waiting, I observed the other tables were not receiving service either.  The food was meh bar food - nothing to write home about.  The music in the background was some kind of hard rock that made your head pound.  My bill was $8.16. When I gave the wait person a $20 bill, she asked if I wanted change.  I would like to think I am a generous tipper, but seriously?  And to top It all off, it took 15 minutes for the wait person to bring my change back.  Sigh. Unfortunately, another place to add to the Do Not Return list."}
{"text":"I've been here for their Sunday Brunch; they forgot to open(unlock) the door in front so we thought they were closed. Came back a bit later and tried the side door which was open and they were thankful for us telling them about the front door being locked.  Brunch was ok.  The next time we were looking for a bite before a movie at Point Cinemas, so we stopped in around 4pm on a Saturday.  There were only two customers at the bar. We sat at a table. Our waiter was right there with our menus and soon had our drinks. We ordered a Cardiac burger with egg, bacon, Colby Jack cheese and hash browns and a Black n' Blue Burger with Waffle fries.  Both were excellent!! The waffle fries were perfectly crispy golden brown....great with the mustard on the table.  And I love being served by a gentleman who knows his stuff. We enjoyed our food and made it to our movie in time too thanks to the quick and thorough service...no having to keep asking for refills or condiments or more napkins.... He was on top of his game as our server.  Definitely going to return for another meal before or after a show."}
{"text":"Great cheese curds and one of the best places to watch a Packers game. I mean if you go into a dive bar expecting amazing food then that is your own fault. But for bar food they are pretty good."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a lunch the other day.  Meh.   not impressed.  I had a \"tuna melt\" - which ended up being a bland tuna sandwich on toasted bread.  Onion rings were from a frozen bag....lame."}
{"text":"Very rude and slow service. Our waitress was inattentive and acted like anything I asked her was too much for her. (I'm ordering food without substitutions...it's not hard).  I paid for all you can eat fish. Had to flag the waitress down and ask each time for more. She asked whether I wanted two or three more fish; the first time, I answered three. The second time, I said three again and she brought two.  Seriously?  Couldn't eat it all (knew I wouldn't) and asked for a box. She said \"I'd rather not\" and walked away. She didn't say \"it's against policy\" or \"I'll double check if I can do that,\" oh no. So I asked the owners' mom who was walking by and she was even ruder and accused me of taking food home \"to feed the neighbors.\"  I will NEVER give them my money again.  Average tasting food and terrible service aren't worth it."}
{"text":"Ho-hum. Bartenders are never really that friendly. Ambiance is okay. Nothing special. I did enjoy some of their music the last time I was there."}
{"text":"The only thing irish about this \"irish pub\" is they sever Guiness and have Jameson Whiskey. Otherwise there isn't anything irish on the menu and no irish ambiance at all. Boooring."}
{"text":"Very bad service from the bartender in every way.  He did not make the drink proper after very clear instructions. He did the same thing on second round as if it was purposely. Worse of all he threw the card at us in an insulting manner when we requested to close the tab. They were understaffed with what looked like only one person working. That's really no excuse to act rude. This all happened this last Saturday night."}
{"text":"I used to like to go to O'Grady's.  They used to make a pretty good burger.  But over the last 3 years or so they've really slipped.  I used to take my pops into here and we used to get burgers and have a few beers, but I wouldn't take him here anymore.  I've tried to eat here about 4 times in the last 3 years (I keep going back because I really used to like it.)  The last two times I got a burger they were overcooked and not well seasoned.  The service was also poor and slow. I also used to like the Mozzarella sticks with pretzels on the breading, but the last few times I ordered them they were overcooked as well.     I went in once and 3/4 of the beer taps were not working.    At least they still have a decent bottled beer selections and some Irish beers on tap.  I'll go in for a beer late night or before a movie or something, but I don't think I'll be able to eat here again, which is sad.  I hope they turn it around."}
{"text":"My mom and I went there for St. Patrick's Day and had a very bad experience. We arrived around 11:30 and the place was starting to fill up.  We were the first two on the wait list. The host did not notice there was an empty table and went to clear it after we pointed it out. It was a booth, and the host insisted on sitting my mom and I \"family style\" with two strangers, as the wait list was starting to grow. We didn't like that idea and said we'd wait for a smaller table to open up. The host grunted, started walking toward the booth and promptly turned around and yelled at us to follow her. We decided to leave. We understood that St. Pat's day is probably an unusally busy day for them, but we were treated very unprofessionally."}
