{"text":"When I have a little time to myself, I'll stop in Barnes and Noble to pick up a book.  Then I'll head over to Harper's for some quiet reading time and a glass or two of wine.  The menu has great vegetarian options that most restaurants do not offer, and the food is delicious.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This is the only port in a mall storm....on this side of town. But I do love their food and service.  The salmon with grilled veggies delish.  Always a fan of Harper Group."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by someone local and close to the hotel we we're staying inn. 

The restaurant was a quick walk from the Hampton inn. On arriving we were seated promptly and our order taken. On the positive side, the decor was lovely and rustic and although not a large menu, there we're enough options to find something satisfactory.  

I got the margarita pizza and it was not bad but it was not what I was expecting. It had chicken and Cheddar cheese with only a little bit of Basil; it was a thin crust with crusty edges (which I liked). My friend got the BBQ plate (western style) which was tasty, although the ribs had very little meat. My father ordered a steak with pimento cheese, brussle sprouts and a baked potato.  The steak was good but the sprouts we're under cooked.  

The music was also rather loud making it hard to talk to talk to our waiter and at times each other.

All in all I may return in the future although i might check other places first."}
{"text":"After leaving my house at 4am and flying from SF to Charlotte, my parents  decide it would be a good idea to meet my aunt and uncle at Harper's for dinner.

Not a bad idea, except...we took a wrong turn and spent an hour in the car trying to find our way.  I'm not going to go into detail about my family dynamics, but just trust me that this is a really really bad way to start the Christmas holiday.  

The nice people at Harper's put up with 2 phone calls and were very helpful with directions.

Now to the food, Blue Moon on tap, yay!  

And the Chicken Supremes are my absolute favorite.  Well spiced chicken tenders and fries, and they serve it with 2 sauces.  I highly recommend double-dipping in both.

Oh and Mom and Dad are getting GPS tomorrow.  Merry fucking Christmas."}
{"text":"Went this morning for a brunch.  Table ordered the regular omelette (ham and cheddar), french toast and sides of hash browns, bacon and fresh fruit.

Omelette, hash browns and french toast were all tasty.  The bacon \"side\" was two small, thin strips and the fresh fruit was ordinary.

I'd give the food three stars but with prices at about $9 each for the breakfast entrees, I'm knocking a star off for value.

We choose Harper's because we could make a reservation and my friend needed to catch a plane so we couldn't wait for a table at any other place.  But unless I'm in a similar time crunch, I'm unlikely to choose Harper's again for a Sunday brunch.

I have enjoyed lunch at Harper's previously and would do that again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Thursday night at 7pm--plenty of room, not crowded. Waitress insisted we sit at a tight table for 2 rather than roomy booth, but offered to hold our packages. Fairly long wait for our food. Margherita pizza was extremely salty and oily--did not like it.  Husband said that nachos were overly salty too.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Eh, not bad. The prosciutto and arugula pizza is great, but they don't carry it anymore... their in-house, freshly shaved prosciutto isn't available until further notice. Right. One of my table mates had the steak and fries. Now, for $18, I'm not expecting a buttery filet. But, this was tough to the point of being inedible. I had the summer salmon salad. The salmon was ordered medium rare, but came well done. It was also a tiny piece of fish - had the rest of the salad been adequate, I wouldn't have minded. However, the \"salad\" consisted of a handful of baby greens, no dressing, and a couple of feta cubes/olives, and two cherry tomatoes. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is always consistent here. We always ask for a window seat when we go. 

The service the last time we went wasn't as good as we were used to. The server was very abrupt and kept interrupting as we ordered. After a while she came and served our food  as she served my friends food she tilted the plate and spilled half of the fries on the table. If that wasn't bad enough, she started putting the spilled fries back on my friends plate. My friend stopped her and told her to just leave the fries there and not put them on the plate.  Then our server disappeared. When she finally was visible what was she doing but talking to a table of her friends.  No refills of our sodas or to check if we were doing OK. She was having too much fun with her friends. When she finally came over we asked for the check. My friend had a coupon from an email for $10 off the meal. The server snatched the coupon out of my friends hand and told us she would be right back. We had enough so we asked another server to get the manager for us. Josh was very sympathetic and told us that he would talk to the server.  

The bad service rated a 2 but the food as usual was excellent and the way the manager stepped up made us rate our experience higher."}
{"text":"Dinner after piano recital with the family.  A family favorite but have never reviewed.  Great kids menu (12 and under).  Always start with the dipping trio--they refill the chips.

Always a great value-salads are huge.  Prime rib always a winner (if they didn't run out).  They could use an upgrade on the tap beer--my only suggestion.

Cozy enough for adults night out but lively and fine for school age kids. Winner!!!"}
{"text":"Was there on Thurs n reminded what a great little find this place is.  The bar food for budget minded..... Pizzas tasty n little oiliness. Great flavor with huge tomato slices..
Sangria folks....... Huge, potent, good to look at.... hanging participle.  It can do that. I forgot bar food discount round happy hour. Peace"}
{"text":"A rose by any other name...  Harper's is a local Charlotte chain, but can easily be mistaken for Houston's, J. Alexander's, or any of the other multitude of generic, upscale dining establishments scattered across the country.  And that's not a bad thing.  What you see is what you get at Harper's: warm, cozy tables and booths, attentive servers, and a plethora of tasty menu options of plentiful portion size.  And luckily, the prices are compatible with the experience as well.  A solid establishment!"}
{"text":"Usually there for lunch and the food used to be great.  Quality has went down as the price went up. Not worth going so much anymore.  Made the mistake of accidentally walking thru the kitchen and the manager was using language that was highly inappropriate.  Along with seeing all the cooks in the kitchen plating cooked prepared food and not one of them had on gloves.  That's highly disgusting.  Would never return if it wasn't close and had to bring clients there.  Will strongly be looking for a new lunch meeting spot."}
{"text":"Barbecue sampler was fantastic. They served it with coleslaw and two types of sauce. Highly recommend you try this plate. 
3 choices of meats."}
{"text":"Before heading home after our ski trip. I decided to stop by and hang out since my home girl/cousin works as a bartender here. So she got me the street side tacos for me to munch on. It was bland, nothing special at all. I tried to stay true of not eating ethnic food at a chain restaurant, but the shit was free. But this experience reinforce that I am right. If it wasn't for the fact that it was free, I would give this place one star. I can't comment on service since I have a conflict but people seem to be nice.
It does look like a step up from TGI/Apple Bees etc and to be fair, I just had the tacos. But I suspect the rest of the food are blah too. This coming from a guy that knows somebody that works there. Sorry. It is, what it is."}
{"text":"harper's reminds me of a kid who consistently gets \"A's\", isn't flashy, never causes any problems, and yet, doesn't get the recognition he or she deserves.  over the 14 years i've lived in charlotte, i've probably been to harper's 15-20 times - that averages about 1-2 dinners a year.  how is that possible?  how have i not chosen this restaurant over others that aren't as consistent, well-priced, and just plain good.   i've never had anything but great food and service at harper's, and they might just have the best chicken fingers in town.

i'm pleased to say that when my husband and i were deciding where to go on saturday night for a 6pm dinner with our kids and my mom, we picked harper's.  it was delicious.  first of all, it's a beautiful restaurant with servers who are always on top of their game.  secondly, it has a huge selection of entrees, wine, and very good kids' meals.  my kids split a cheese pizza (and, of course, i had to try a piece).  it was ridiculously good.  in fact, it was one of the best pieces of cheese pizza i've ever had . . . at harper's.  can you believe that?  it was thin crust with a ton of gooey cheese, and not too much marinara sauce.  honestly, i couldn't believe how good it was . . . but, i'll move on.

i had the chicken fingers with two sides - and i picked mac and cheese and vegetables.  insanely good.  their chicken fingers are so delicious - i could go on for days about those . . . and the mac and cheese was also some of the best i've ever had.  i love a gooey mac and cheese where the cheese overtakes the macaroni, and this was definitely that kind of mac and cheese.  the veggies could have been cooked a little longer, but they were very good.  my husband had the veggie burger, and he couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  my mom had a grilled chicken sandwich, and she also thought it was fantastic.  the kids each got a scoop of vanilla ice cream (comes with the kids meal - bonus!).  for dessert, we all split a hot fudge/ice cream/brownie (with me eating the lion's portion).  it wasn't the best hot fudge brownie i've ever had, but i consider myself a dessert connoisseur, and really - can you get a bad one?  it was very good.  our wine was great, my husband enjoyed his blue moon beers, and all in all, it was a perfect dinner.  side note . . . i do have to admit that i had to get up and run 8 miles the next morning because the food was so good that i couldn't leave a morsel on my plate.  but it was so worth it - i'd do it all again!

go to harper's with or without kids, and you won't regret it.  it's a very good meal, reasonably priced, and i bet you'll walk away thinking: \"hmm . . . that was really good.  remind me again why we don't come here more often?\""}
{"text":"I'm doing this a little differently.  There is some downside.  Accessibility. It's a high traffic area that requires some patience. Getting there is easy. Leaving? Unless traffic is flowing your way, challenging.

Party of 3.

We considered outside dining for a hot second. A little much.  Inside we were pleasantly greeted and seated immediately .  Not a big crowd, early for dinner time, late for lunch.  Lunch specials were still in effect until 4.  I thought that was nice, different.  Belinda was our server and arrived promptly to take drink orders and answer any questions.

My nephew, ( I owed him an apology meal for subjecting him to the Italian like place on Morehead that is an open kitchen), played it safe and ordered chicken supremes.  I needed a culinary exorcism after the nightmare of the aforementioned, had the trout and my brother had steak.  Honestly, they don't bombard you with too many choices but everything looked so good there wasn't much I didn't want to try.  

We tried the crab tomato stack with avocado and pesto.  It was fresh and very tasty. I'm not a huge fresh tomato fan, my southern card could be revoked, but I enjoyed it.  We even got the anti veggie guy to give it a try.  We may turn him yet.  My trout was great.  The crispy potatoes not so much, and a little mushy but tasty.  The green beans, were vibrant and I ate them all.  Chicken supremes vanished quickly.  My brother's steak looked bigger than the description and I envied the gorgonzola scallion butter he got..It might have helped the potatoes.  I planned for dessert.  Had the apple pie and they both got a skillet cookie.  We had to wait for fresh dough to be made to make one of our orders.  Men in my family don't share plates.  It came out a little later than the other desserts.  It looked great and must have tasted pretty good too. He tried to finish but couldn't.  Close, no horseshoe.  

The service could have been flawless but I get that we don't live in a perfect world.  The food impressed so much that I order pie an pasta to go.  Food this good should be shared. I wanted more people I care about to know that I was cared about here.  Quality and genuine care  make a huge difference. The effort to ensure our comfort and enjoyment of a good meal was enough to guarantee my return."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Harper's, and have been for about a month or so. We head there every Sunday after church, always sitting at the bar.  It's not that the seats are more comfy or the food is better.  No, we sit there because 1) there are TVs to watch football but mostly 2) because of the AWESOME bartenders!  Shelly has got to be one of my favorite people in Charlotte, and her partners in crime are also friendly.  She is so friendly and sweet and sassy--a great combo in a bartender!  

The food, of course, is great too, otherwise we wouldn't keep coming back.  My husband adores the brisket (it IS delicious!).  I have had the turkey burger and the regular burger and loved both of those.  Usually on Sundays I get something from the brunch menu.  My only complaint is that it's a bit lacking in length, but there are pretty good things on it.  I have liked the waffles, I have also had the BELT (which was alright) and the French Toast (which was good, but ask for the fruit compote on the side).  The grits (if you have read any of my previous reviews, you'll know that I LOVE GRITS!!) are good.  They clearly make them with chicken broth, which almost makes them too chicken-y, but they also have cheese.  They're very good. (Today, in fact, they lacked the signature chicken flavor, and were some of the best grits I've ever had!)  

My husband has had the French Dip Sandwich (pretty good), pork tenderloin (also pretty good--not outstanding) and the Cajun omelette (just okay), but he remains convinced that you should just get the brisket.  For $13, you get a lot of delicious brisket with BBQ sauce, excellent fries, and one more side (it comes with cole slaw, but we've never gotten it.  The green beans were good when I had them).  I have also ordered the brisket, and he's right, it is FANTASTIC!!!

On Thursday they have trivia night.  My husband and I happened to be there this past Thursday, and beat the long-time reigning champs.  It is pretty easy trivia (college mascots, car makers, countries and continents were our categories this week. Apparently the reigning champs COMPLAINED that the questions were too hard.  Excuse me?  You've won for the last few months and have the balls to complain that the questions are too hard?  I don't like these guys.  I'm glad we kicked their asses.--sorry I just got totally off-topic.).  Don't be scared off.  

So come down to Harper's and sit at the bar!  It's a lot of fun, the food and drinks are good, and the staff is friendly.  Hard to beat that!"}
{"text":"Excellent for Gluten Free Dining!

Harper's probably has one of the most extensive gluten free menus available.  If you're looking for meat & potatoes, this is the place.

Not only is there GF food delicious, but their waitstaff is very conscious of your dietary needs.  They carry a list of ingredients in their aprons!

I ordered the Sante Fe Chicken Soup and it looked like barley (gluten) was in it.  Our waitress pulled out an ingredient list and assured us it was actually brown rice.  

All they need now to make it complete is a gluten free beer!"}
{"text":"Harpers has a nice bar area if you want to catch one after work.  The service is consistently good and their BBQ pork is excellent.  I have dined there 10+ times and have always been satisfied and so have my guests.  It's a good atmosphere in the bar and dining areas."}
{"text":"For starters, its very low quality food. The handful of french fries delivered on the plate were more than half rotten pieces of potatoes. I don't understand why, when you see the crumpled, bruised, soggy smelly chunks of potatoes fall out of the bag, that you continue to cook them and serve them. The chicken from the caesar wrap was dry and tasted of freezer burn. the waitress can't hear or maybe comprehend that no lemon means no lemon. don't bring a tea and just plop a nasty piece of lemon in the glass 2 minutes after I said NO LEMON. overall this place is terrible and you'd get better quality by going into the mall and eating that processed crap."}
{"text":"Have dined at Harpers many times at both the Woodlawn Rd location and also the SouthPark location.  I haven't been in a few years and was down near Carolina Place Mall and looking for a good, casual meal.  I saw the Harpers and based on good memories from visits to previous locations decided to dine there.  

Walking in the traditional wood fired grill gave me pleasant reminders as the scent of hickory filled the air.  We sat down in a comfortable booth and began looking over the menu.  I was open to new items as I was sure things had changed but have to say I was a bit disappointed to see that Harpers seems to be letting others lead.  Most of their menu items looked like things other restaurants have innovated.  There were a couple of promising looking items (but they did not include the $17 farm raised salmon).  I decided to go with the crispy chicken sandwich.  Harpers used to have an amazing chicken sandwich with a simple but good bun and a tasty dijon mustard sauce.  My companion went with the artisan pizza (flatbread) with bacon cheeseburger.  He loved it and he also loved the tomato bisque.  My chicken sandwich was nothing special.  It was OK but it was dripping wet and the chicken was kinda room temperature.  Slaw on a sandwich is OK but it shouldn't be sopping wet.  And side from the hint of jalapeno, there just wasn't any flavor.  Texture was pretty bland as well.  The slaw was wet but not crisp.  The bread was OK but not remarkable.  The chicken was competently cooked but not hot.  

The fries came in hot but were a mix of crispy and soggy.  Some seemed like they had been overcooked but were crispy.  Others were soft and saturated with oil as if they had been dumped in when the oil was well below temperature.  

We had discussed getting dessert there versus going someplace and getting a whole cheesecake, pie, etc and simply taking it home.  However, I remembered the deep dish apple cobbler so we decided to share one.

It took a very long time to get the cobbler and I though that perhaps it had been freshly made and they were simply waiting on it to be thoroughly cooked.  One bite told me that the cobbler (which was still pretty flavorful) was at least a day old and had simply been re-heated.  The breading was soft and saturated with no hint of crispness or crunch.  There was plenty of cinnamon and sugar.  I also ran across a couple of apple slices.  However, this seemed a bit short of my memories of hot and fresh cobbler I had had numerous times before.  On the whole it was a poor substitute for something that used to be a signature dessert.  

Given a $38 bill with tip for myself and my son I won't be hurrying back.  I'm sure a couple of soft drinks would have pushed us into the $42 range and that's simply to much for an \"OK\" lunch for two."}
{"text":"Not bad but over priced for what you get. I have only been 2x's within a year and was a little disappointed. I went for lunch last April and it was hard to find something light on the menu. I just went for dinner and ordered the honey mustard glazed salmon. It was ok but nothing special for $20.00. Probably would not go again."}
{"text":"We go to Harpers pretty much every week. They have wonderful wait staff and friendly managers that we know by name. Most importantly their food is delicious. 
Some of our favorites include...

Dipping Trio
Parmesan Truffle Fries 
Sweet Potato Fries
Chicken Supremes
Any and all of their pizzas and salads 
Pimento Burger (or pimento anything for that matter)

...I could go on, but I'm getting hungry. 
Anyway, our family loves Harpers and we will always be devoted customers!"}
{"text":"We both had the 5 cheese pasta and it was the best, excellent. We were there after shopping and were tired and it was late afternoon. Service was excellent, not crowded at this point. We would have liked a little more bread but other than that it was a great time."}
{"text":"When my companion suggested HARPER'S for a LATE LUNCH this weekend I agreed since my lone dining experience with them was 2 years ago and pleasant.  We were greeted & seated immediately.  Nice roomy booth.  We were obviously given the dinner menu ( at 3pm ????? ) based on the prices.  NOTE: Serving a dinner menu at 3pm is too early ... 5pm is better.  I had a lunch appetite and was not ready to eat a heavy meal so early in the day ... w/ 2 additional stops to make.  I thought it was possibly a push to maximize profit.   My companion was game to order dinner ( Harpers Newbie!).  We ordered the chicken finger appetizer, 2 baked chicken w/ veggies plates & 2 sides of mash potato, 2 sweet teas & 1 slice of tuxedo cake.  ITA with other Yelp reviewers, HARPER'S IS OVERPRICED.  The check was $70 tip included.  Considering food, service and location a reasonable tab would be $55-60.

Also must concur the food was merely OK.  Chicken & mashed potato were decent.  My companion did not like the seasoning which was used on everything we ate.  The mixed veggies were a bust w/ me.  Lastly we agreed for a $70 tab ... hot bread & butter were strangely M.I.A.  Did we not order from the dinner menu? Yes!  Had we thoroughly enjoyed the food we might've made peace w/ the high tab.  Several issues make a return to HARPER'S very unlikely."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the chicken supremes! SOOO Good! I also love the sweet potato fries. My husbands favorite is the penne pasta dish with the sausage. It is really tasty.  Great place. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't eat at Harpers very often, simply because it isn't very close to where I live. But when I go to Pineville I like to dine there. I like the BBQ grilled chicken sandwich with roasted vegetables. The roasted veggies aren't listed on the menu but you can just ask for them. They are the best I've ever had! I am going to work on making veggies like that for myself. So, if you go make sure to order the roasted veggies...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch!  Dined in restaurant last Sunday and really enjoyed the meal and atmosphere.  I suggest you call ahead as we waited about 15 minutes for a table sound 12:45. The Cajun Omelet with grits was fantastic!  My daughter had the chicken and biscuits and it was as good as their chicken supremes which is a favorite of my kids. Husband had the ahi tuna and always enjoys that meal. Great lunch!"}
{"text":"Like the food but the overall experience here isn't as good as the one in Columbia, SC.  I think a little upgrading and decor touches could help, the food is really more like 3.5 approaching 4 star -- depending on the menu item.  Outdoor seating in season.  Location is convenient to South Park folks, and plentiful."}
{"text":"Was at the Harper's for a surprise birthday party for my niece . Her husband set it up and there were 35 people there . We were in a private room with a set menu. Room was nice and look like the staff are doing good till the food came. The set menu has a sirloin steak with roasted potatoes and veggies and side salad. The first course salad come out a small salad may be 4 or 5 bites. Then the steak was about 6 ounces , the potatoes were raw and soggy veggies and no gorgonzola butter sauce like it said on the menu . So I asked for the fries in place if under cooked potatoes and asked for the sauce so there is some flavor. The server comes back and said well there is no sauce on the steak and I said I know but it should be like it said in the menu , so she comes back with a scoop of butter and hand it to me like I was supposed to melt it some how on my cold and overcooked steak , and left . By the way it was $25 per person. It was a birthday party did not want to  complain there so here it is. At least hope the chief at Harper's can see this and be shame of what he or she put out that day . Other people have the same issue too. Don't think I will go back again"}
{"text":"I don't know why I continue to come here.  The food is decent but it takes so friggin ' long to arrive.  My lunch break is an hour.  I spend about half of it waiting for my food to arrive.  It's a sandwich, not an intricately constructed fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I really like this place the burgers are very good the chicken here is very good.

Parking is terrible because it's the mall

Fried chips are very good to"}
{"text":"Long ago, I worked at Harper's for a spring and summer after college.  Now every time I go, the smell of the place takes me back (something between wood-fired kitchen and just... kitchen).

This is another relatively safe place I can go with my parents.  Though their veggie options are scant, their veggie burger is made in-house, I can get their six cheese penne without bacon, and I've always enjoyed their pimento cheese dip.  

Unfortunately, I found little to eat for lunch yesterday.  I was looking for something light, and save ordering a salad (sans meat, of course), there wasn't much else on the menu that appealed to me.  I do love a good bowl of soup, but Harper's rarely has a veggie soup on tap, and yesterday was no different.  I ordered the spinach quesadilla, hoping it would be more spinachy than cheesy and thinking it's hard to eff up a quesadilla.  Right?

WHAT a disappointment.  The quesadilla was a total mess, stuffed to the brim with a slurpy cheese mixture.  The filling was incredibly uneven - one triangle had cheese with just a hint of spinach, another was filled entirely with the spinach mixture (which I am 99% sure is just their spinach dip repurposed), and another had a surprising number of cold, mealy tomato cubes.

Per the usual, my dad ordered a small cup of soup, and the server barely hid her disdain at our tiny order.  The sneer was palpable.

I think I'm done with Harper's for a while."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was new, and was actually a kind of decent restaurant...now, it seems to be kind of decent at best. 

I was first to arrive in my party of five, and requested a comfortable, large booth for myself and four older adults. After being briefed on the fact that my future table was   Being occupied by an employee and her food, but that it would SURELY be cleaned right away, I was ushered to an incredibly small tight horseshoe booth by the bar. Not really my definition of a comfortable seating situation for five...

Service was not The best, but we were there in the awkward time between 3-4. Regardless, I would expect to not be rushed to make decisions on my lunch during downtime. One of my elderly company requested a dinner menu to compare (as we were informed dinner was served all day), and it was easy to tell why....they were practically the same menu! Maybe take one salad away, add two entrees for dinner...

Started off with three dip app, the pimento cheese and salsa were spot on...artichoke dip was lukewarm and not as tasty. As my lunch I ordered the ahi salad, under the assumption (and confirmation by the server) that this would indeed be a salad. It came out on a rectangular plate- small, maybe 1\"x1\" chunks of \"sashimi\" grade seared tuna, a small side bowl of greens, and a random bowl of noodles with an attempted peanut sauce. I was a little confused as to how this could be perceived as a true salad. It was an incredibly Americanized bland representation of a tuna titake at best, with a random bowl of bland noodles. I asked for extra dressing to dip my tuna in, and I NEVER do that. To a piece of deliciously fresh fish, that would be sacrilege. My saving grace was the side of pimento Mac and cheese...which I devoured. My cohorts had burgers that looked awesome, doused with pimento cheese and onions. Clearly this was the way to have gone. 

Point and case. I was going on a limb by ordering asian fusion from Harpers, but Do not order the ahi salad if you too appreciate the value and taste  of sashimi grade fish. You will be disappointed at the cost of $17. I'd reccommend going for the cheaper and much more appetizing looking burger, and a more comfortable table."}
{"text":"There aren't many options on the menu for a light lunch. Everything is too big to eat in one meal, even what I thought would be a side salad. I've tried taking part of my salad with me to eat later, without adding the dressing. The lettuce is never fresh enough to hold up even for a snack a couple hours later. The homemade chicken noodle soup was very good, but it was so creamy, I could only eat a little of it. Based on the crowd, they are loved by many. I just have a hard time finding something for myself when I'm with my usual group and it's Harper's turn."}
{"text":"Not a fan* I've sent back meals here more than once , and left food unfinished many times because it wasn't good. The hummus appetizer is good and so are the ribs....but everything else is less than mediocre."}
{"text":"Great food,great service,great atmosphere,sometimes has a wait during peak dinning hours so your best to try call ahead seating."}
{"text":"I'm chowing down at Harper's
It's burning my chest
-Rick Ross

The food is good:  in fact, the six cheese penne, beef brisket, tuna, and wagyu burger (probably not a lot of wagyu for under $12, but I digress) are great.  We usually stop by for lunch once a month during our Carolina Place run, and we always get courteous, prompt service.

So, why three stars?  Well, I don't get heartburn.  Period.  Okay, there's one exception:  Harper's.  Game day at BoA stadium with nothing but Brats and Buds for breakfast and lunch?  No problem.  Roasted tomatillo salsa with mole sauce?  Om nom nom.  Arrabiata washed down with a few Peronis?  Happiness.  

A salad from Harper's?  Instant heartburn.  Six cheese penne?  PBJ sandwiches for the next two days.  Attempting to finish the brisket?  Please kill me six hours later.

The food is good, but there's a price to be paid."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Great service. Great atmosphere. Across from SouthPark mall. Perfect for a date. Great food. Except to be honest, don't order the macaroni and cheese unless you want to go to the bathroom 8x in one day. I still give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Several locations... but Carolina Place\" (near the Barnes & Noble & REI off CP Pkwy side) is close and has many on staff who used to be at theWoodlawn location that closed when the Lynx rail went through the parking lot along Old Pineville Road.

This restaurant has a nice variety to choose from without being overwhelming. Typically has a number of daily specials that are tempting. I've never had a disappointing meal, and most of the time the service is quite attentive even when very busy. I like the coffee Harper's serves.

A group of friends (couples) drop by here every few months to catch up and enjoy a meal together. We can comfortably have any mix of pizza, burgers, bbq, a steak, or a special... linger over the meal visiting and NEVER get the impression that the staff is trying to rush us on out. There is also an accommodating attitude to couples sharing a dessert. The wait satff remains attentive to refill needs, etc., even after the bill has been paid. Rarely ever have we had a server having an \"off\" night. Sometimes we have to \"force\" ourselves to go elsewhere when we meet just to keep from ONLY going here for these \"catch ups\" when we meet.

I do not know how long its been on the menu, but visitng there this week we had the Tuxedo Cake... not like one I'd had elsewhere... THIS ONE IS CHEESECAKE! This cake is AMAZING... WOW! Texture is much like a NY Style cheesecake with a crushed chocolate wafer crust, chocolate, and white layer! SO creamy good!

{"text":"Great veggie burger. Best in town. Veggie plate used to be outstanding too until they downsized the baked potatoes. Potato should be bigger than the portion of sour cream and cheese."}
{"text":"Food & service are very good. I would prefer to come here versus the over rated Village Tavern."}
{"text":"Really really really great place to eat.  Nothing is greasy, and everything tastes fresh.  Slow roast short ribs are the best I have ever tasted.  Ahi sashimi salad is a full blown meal.  Portions are very generous and prices are more than reasonable.  The restaurant is very nice too, very classy, and staff are very polite and attentive.  I also recommend the bbq salmon if they have it.  Very moist with great flavor.

Although it looks like a cookie cutter chain, don't let the applebees look fool you.  This place is first class without being first class expensive and it totally has no snotty-ness in it.  Did I mention how good the food is?  

Friends tried the filet-mignon and they said it was the best they have ever had.  Perfectly cooked just as they asked for.  This coming from a  world traveler and self proclaimed steak lover this says a lot."}
{"text":"Was there with an international group of colleagues recently.  I was very unimpressed. Humus dip that had far too much cumin in it. Soggy chips with a good steak. A double espresso that smelled and tasted more like the last bit of coffee that had been sitting in the thermos all day (which it probably was). Don't go there, there are lots of good alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"I had the seared rare tuna and found it exellent. Would go here again! For a mall restaurant, this ain't bad at all."}
{"text":"This is a Charlotte Staple. Their menu is timeless as is their history in the South park area.  Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah, I get it, sometimes you just got to get your tweet on, I agree, OMG LOL, I can't believe this guy who just came in here to get his to go order, #LMFAO.   Now don't be discouraged to dine in and sit in the bar area, where if you truly want to feel disconnected from your date, then the touch screen monitors are perfect, for you or the hostess.  After all who sits and talks with each other at dinner any more? The food is on par with an Americana type mid level restaurant, however the service leaves a bit to be desired.  When my salad came with a dried up crusted chicken breast on it and no dressing, I called to speak to a manager, but they were busy. Apparently a Tuesday night is busy for the manager (not the hostess).  The veggie burger tastes like cardboard, although the bun gives it a sort of layered cardboard effect which is not bad, if you're washing it down with tequila.  The filet even if ordered med. rare, comes out med. edible, and asking the wait staff for a refill is like asking the DMV for an estimated wait time; you're probably not going to get what you're looking for.   This is particularly sad because I used to love this restaurant, but even with prepubescent couples or online match dates who sit in the bar area to have the touch screen monitors mediate their awkward conversations,  it's still probably not the right fit.   The ribs are good, but the sides aren't.  If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor who lets their dog crap all over my lawn and never picks it up, or my grandfather who doesn't have any taste buds left and isn't bothered by slow service, because it takes him two hours to finish a bowl of soup anyway.  I would call ahead to make sure they're not busy, and definitely not on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable, which is nice for couples and families.

But with each experience, I am less impressed. The food is good. However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.

I am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /"}
{"text":"Dont go there during lunch.  It is jam packed and your lunch hour will be over before you food comes.  I had the catfish burger and it was entirely too salty."}
{"text":"The food is always good, and suits a variety of tastes. We went for Mother's Day and our table had fish tacos, a vegetable plate, PB&J Sushi with broccoli, and chicken & waffles.   The waitress was very attentive, and gave us several updates as to when to expect our food--but we came patient since it's a no-cook holiday for moms!  The worst part of the experience was the family behind us who basically let their toddler stare and pound a blunt object on the back of our booth while blasting Calliou from an iPad.  Not the restaurant's fault, but have some consideration for other diners. My kiddos would have (and were) taken out of the room if they disturbed other patrons and wouldn't listen.  Back to the review--we loved our time there, and will go back in the future!!"}
{"text":"For the value Harper's is a bust paid $20 for ll oz. Prime rib, while it was good it did not come with a salad or any bread. Every good restaurant even the less expensive chains like Outback and Long horn you get a salad and endless fresh bread. At the very least give a salad with entree's of this caliber. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Spent a rainy Saturday afternoon shopping and decided to hit Harper's for lunch. They were slammed so there was a brief wait before we were seated. 

The service was impressive. I'm pretty sure the waiter thought I was going to be high maintenance because as soon as he brought my Diet Coke in a short tumbler I stopped him before he left and said, \"Just so you know, I drink like a fish. Do you have any larger glasses to save you some trips?\" He said they didn't, but that he'd bring me two smaller glasses at a time. He kept up with me and the litter of tumblers that accrued over the course of our meal. I can't imagine though, why they insist on serving sodas in tiny little tumbler glasses.

The food was good. I ordered the chopped chef salad with chicken. The menu said it came with avocado, but it did not. Still, it was quite tasty.

The bill for 1 beer, my soda, 1 app and 2 dinner salads came out to roughly $45. Decent, although a little pricey for lunch. Good restaurant, we'll visit again I'm sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were seated for about 15 minutes without a server to order our drinks. Finally when we order our food the server \"forgets\" to put my order in and my boyfriends food comes out about 30 minutes before mine does, management gave me a complimentary salad for my wait, but I felt like I wasted a lot of time just waiting around. Will probably not come back here."}
{"text":"atmosphere is awesome. food is great. (i do miss there old menu). Great place to get a quick eat at the mall that isnt mall food!"}
{"text":"They are very good with gluten free, have a specialized menu.   Not so much for lactose intolerance.   Server did not know if any of the dishes contained butter, and did not offer to go check with the chef.  I ordered the flat iron steak, which came smothered in a spicy sauce. Had I known that, I would have asked for the sauce on the side.  Was stuck with french fries as the only certain lactose free option.  Would have preferred vegetables or roasted potatoes, but server did not know if eithe was prepared with butter.  My husband ordered the hickory grilled sirloin, which turned out to be a very odd cut and not particularly tender.   Server was very pleasant.  As this was my third trip to Harper's and none of the times was there options for lactose free, I will not be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location of Harper's for a long time. Over the years, we have seen a slow decline in the quality of the food and service and a steady increase in prices. 

Our most recent visit was last week. The pulled pork was dry and chewy. The cole slaw had little to no dressing and was basically a pile of cabbage (their cole slaw dressing is fantastic if you can get a good order). They gave me the wrong side order. They also gave my wife the wrong side order. It was one of those meals where you leave feeling cheated. I left half of my food uneaten.

It seems like there is a regular problem with getting things right because there have been a number of times when the orders have been wrong. Also, we used to love their pizza, but it has gone downhill also. The last time I tried the pizza, it was burnt. The time before, it was doughy and undercooked. Other times, it was rubbery from sitting under the heat lamp for too long. 

Also - pet peeve alert - if you serve fries, don't make the customer ask you for ketchup. Just bring it out with the meal. It will save your runner/server a trip and make the customer happier.

We used to be big fans of Harper's, but now I don't think I would recommend them anymore."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and it was okay.  I would have given it two stars, but the service was really good and that's why I gave it three stars.  I ordered one of the specials for my meal - the margarita pizza and it was not the best at all.  It was a decent amount of food though and very filling, but it wasn't that good.  It was pretty flavorless somehow and the cheese wasn't the best.  

They accidentally brought out a cup of the chicken noodle soup for me which I didn't order, but they let me keep it free of charge anyway. I wound up bringing half my pizza and the soup home.  I had the soup for dinner and that was pretty good - so I would recommend getting that.

The good thing about this place is it's prices are reasonable especially in the area it's located.  I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Harper's was recommended to us while we were in Charlotte over the past weekend, so we decided to give it a try.  The food was great... unique without trying too hard, and the waitstaff was very attentive.  We will be going back repeatedly!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. It's fine dining at reasonable prices. 

Their Sicilian Pizza is not to be missed, and I consider it to be their best item, though their steaks and chicken is still A+.

I highly recommend Harper's (and Harper's To Go Go)."}
{"text":"I have always received good service and good food after multiple visits to this restaurant. My favorite is the 6 cheese penne. YUMMY! I also enjoy their Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"Let me tell you gents this place is totes av (average). Really not much to say. If you like food you'll probably be able to eat some of it here. My friends at the table insist that I rate this place as \"good average\" but that seems meaningless. Also $2 beers of which I've had about 6."}
{"text":"So, a few weeks later I was contacted by a different Manager that told me the gift card was returned to them. He did send out another one and I did receive it. So, thanks for that.
My wife and I will venture out to give this place one more shot in the near future."}
{"text":"We eat here fairly frequently, but they are changing their menu to ill effect. Jason's salad, triple dip appetizer, Sante Fe chicken, and several other favorites are no longer on the menu, and have been replaced with substandard selections. We ate there yesterday, pretty good ribeye steak (but over priced for the quality, tough), and saw linguini with meatballs had been added. So, tonight we ordered two linguini and meatballs to go. Barely ate any of either serving. Tasteless sauce and really quite bad meatballs were a real surprise, but unacceptable on any level. It seems that Harpers is becoming hit or miss, not dependable, and we prefer not to take chances when looking for a meal. We will probably be back, but only after the menu offers better fare."}
{"text":"I don't usually give five star reviews, but this place really went out of their way to treat us well at lunch.  I wasn't expecting much from a place connected to a mall, but the menu was diverse and the beer selections were excellent.  We started with the cajun calamari which was good and then the large and fresh entree salads were brought out.

I ordered a pizza which was brought out by the manager who said it was too burnt for their standards, so we could have it if we wanted it and they were remaking the pizza.  How often does a restaurant have enough integrity to fix a mistake before the customer even asks?  They brought the second pizza later and it was top notch.

Sam Adams Cherry Wheat on draft, a good pizza, and superior service.  A winning combination!"}
{"text":"The best word I can come up with to describe this place is, \"lackluster\". 

It was a Thursday night just before 8PM. The restaurant and the bar were both barren. The staff just seemed bored and disinterested in everything. 

The waitress seemed to be in a hurry to get us in and out. Being our first time here we had some questions and she obviously wasn't in the mood to explain anything. 

Started off with the crab and artichoke dip. The dip itself was tolerable, but the \"chips\" were incredibley inconsistent. Some were crispy and others felt like they never made it in to the fryer. They were soft and room temperature with, what appeared to be olive oil, dumped on them and entirely too much dill seasoning. 

They were out of the house steak so I got the brisket. It was cooked well but had no flavor at all. 

Wife got the pastrami sandwich which was pretty good. Probably the only positive of our visit. 

I sincerely doubt I'd visit again and certainly would caution people against going here. My guess is that the place is poorly managed and the staff is burned out from dealing with the mall crowd."}
{"text":"Being from L.A., whenever I travel I never go to restaurants that I can go to at home.  Originally,  we were on our way to The Cheesecake Factory and on the way convinced my sister to try Harper's.  

From the moment we walked in we were treated with that great \"southern  hospitality.\" We asked for a change in seating because of table size (we're giants) and the hostess didn't hesitate to move us and did so with a smile.  My sister had several questions about items on the menu and Tina answered each one, never making us feel rushed.

I started with a cup of the potato cream soup which was off the chain and my sister had the garden salad with the house dressing which could have been a meal unto itself.

For the main entrée, my sister ordered the sirloin steak and loaded baked potato.  She had it prepared well (ugh! If I still ate  red meat, make mine medium rare).  What I appreciated is that, while the steak came as ordered, if she wanted it cooked further it could be done quickly.   As my dad used to say \"better undercooked than overcooked.\"  She indicated that the garlic butter sauce complimented the steak perfectly.

I had the six cheese penne pasta with italian sausage.  Being an Italian cheese fanatic, I was in heaven! I had to force myself to slow down and take the time to enjoy each bite.

I was too stuffed to have dessert but my sister devoured the apple pie ala mode (yeah, I was envious, lol).  Also, Tina kept my pink lemonade filled without me ever asking her to.  Kudos to her considering that it was the dinner hour; she was a true professional. 

Great decor,  great service, and even greater food!!!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"A good place to go if you have a family with different likes and dislikes in food.  There is a wide selection of things to choose from whether you want BBQ or a veggie burger (which our table ordered both and both were good.)  

However that being said, a restaurant that is so broad in choices usually does not make anything that has a WOW factor either.  Everything is good, nothing will knock your socks off or be anything to write home about.

The service was good, the atmosphere was nice, but with so many choices in Charlotte I would not come back in a hurry."}
{"text":"My wife just went to eat there and ordered the six cheese penne and said it was horrible, she didn't take but 2 bites, and she bought me the supreme, NEVER have it, horrible. Mediocre flavors and nothing tastes fresh."}
{"text":"We LOVE Harpers. I get the same meal every time, and it is perfect every single time. The staff is exquisite!"}
{"text":"Sorry, the food was just horrible.  Ribs bad, penne pasta really bad, kids portions entirely to small and bad.  Veggie burger was pretty good.  All that bad and overpaid to boot.  The baked creamy corn side may have been the worst thing to ever touch my lips!"}
{"text":"I went to Harpers for a birthday lunch celebration and had a wonderful experience! The salad I got was HUGE and very tasty. They also have the best cheesy bread ever, you have to try it! The service was very quick and pleasant. And they even gave me a giant piece of chocolate cake for free! It was the best chocolate cake I've ever had, no joke. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I love coming to Harper's when I'm in this area. Today, I had the Crab Stack (on Chef Specials menu).  Very light, delicious and low carb!  My waitress, Teresa B, was just wonderful. She had the prettiest smile I've seen in a while. She was VERY attentive and pleasant. Harper's hires the BEST people."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences u have had in Charlotte.   In an area where most eateries are 4 star or above, Harper's is a 1 star experience.  They messed up our dinner order, placed wrong menu items on our bills and the service was lackluster at best.   If you are in Southpark, please try any other eatery before Harper's.  I would rather eat McDonald's and I don't eat at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Even on a Friday night we were seated reasonably quickly. Our server Michael was outstanding, and the food was very good."}
{"text":"Used to be our staple, but each time I go back their food gets more and more greasy. Who in the world is their new chef???. And their garlic dressing is disgusting."}
{"text":"I was going to write great place to have some drinks but then I remembered that the bar girl is horrible and you need to call her every time. also the menu is very limited. if you go in for lunch and eat at the bar. the bar food is half price."}
{"text":"3.5 only because I need more variety on the menu with me being a Pescatarian (Seafood/ Water Animals only for meat).
My family and I have been to Harpers a total of 4 times now, it's NOT the restaurant we say \"Okay let's go out to eat, where should we go, I know HARPERS\" . Harpers is that place we end up at if the Mr. and I are dragged to Carolina Place mall by our little one. She MUST go to that mall because it's the only one we have found in Charlotte that has a Forever 21. 
One item that you can't go wrong with is the Baja Fish Tacos on Corn tortilla, the salsa is sooooo GOOD. We end up dipping our fries in the salsa if we are eating fries due to the taste. My daughter ALWAYS get the chicken tenders and my husband ALWAYS take one, the chicken tenders put you in the mindset of Houston's restaurant chicken tenders. I believe Harpers may be owned by the same restaurant group as my daughter and husband are chicken tender connoisseurs and they feel that they are TOO SIMILAR so they must have the same recipe (owner). This more recent trip they had a Fish sandwich special of the day \"Blacken Salmon BLT\" not sure why EVERY restaurant in Charlotte like to wrap pork around everything or add it to everything but that's the case and I'm over my soap box. I ordered the Blacken Salmon BLT MINUS the BACON, it was pretty awesome tasting. I have no complaints. It came out on a whole grain toasted bun and the tartar sauce was extremely fresh and tasty. I had a backed sweet potato on the side MINUS the brown sugar and cinnamon, it was cooked to perfection and I enjoyed it to the fullest. If in Carolina Place Mall and you don't want to eat Food Court Food, check out Harpers especially if you eat all types of meat (you will have a variety of options)."}
{"text":"You haven't had macaroni and cheese until you've tried the Six Cheese Penne Pasta at Harper's.  This is an adult, gourmet version of the popular homestyle classic.  The dish is so incredibly cheesy and flavorful on its own, then they throw in Italian sausage as well.  My mouth was in heaven when we returned to Harper's Restaurant the other night after a year or so absence.   Just be careful about digging into it too quickly.  They bake the entire dish in the oven, so it's steaming hot on the inside as well as the outside.  I, however, was too eager and ended up burning the roof of my mouth.  Oops.  Oh well...it was worth it.  Our service was fantastic, too, and we were immediately seated at a great table...on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer list! We had an awesome dinner of burgers and beer at Harper's. I ate the salmon burger and it was delicious! It had spinach, brioche bun, and incredible sauce on tender salmon. The french fries are yummy! The restaurant is known for their wood fired entrees.  The NC beer list is good and Mondays are $3.50 pints. We ate at the bar and enjoyed good service."}
{"text":"Been here before and sat at the bar with some friends. Great service and good happy hour specials. This past time last week, I went here for drinks and apps with some work colleagues and sat in the bar at the high-top tables. Got there right at 6pm and asked about the happy hour specials that I had in the past. The first waiter mentioned they don't do happy specials anywhere in North Carolina? Tried to explain that I had them before and he didn't think I was correct. I understand if the specials are not in effect when I'm there, but don't try to correct me for what I know I had a few weeks prior. Anyway, moved on to order with a different server and ordered many apps. They were pretty good - had the crab dip, chips and 3 dips and calamari. All were ok, though the calamari was nice. Will go there again before 6pm or after 9pm for the \"bar specials\"."}
{"text":"Got the trio nacho appetizer, loved the spinach dip! Also decided to split a bottle with a friend. The service was amazing! Not only the waitress, but the hostess as well.  Very welcomind and I will be back at this location soon! !"}
{"text":"We were shopping at the mall and decided to stop in. For a Thursday night the place was completely dead. I ordered a beer while we looked over the menu... if we weren't starving and didn't have two small children with us we probably would have left. The menu was very small and all over the place. I decided to go with a daily special, BBQ salmon with mixed veggies. My husband ordered the wood fired pizza. The waitress told me my salmon came with another side so I chose a side salad which was a 3$ up charge. The salad was good, that was probably the best part of the meal. I asked for my salmon medium well and it was medium and mushy. Also, there were no mixed veggies on my plate. My dinner came and it was literally a slab of salmon all by its lonesome. My husband said the pizza was just ok, the pepperoni was still cold and didn't look like it had been on a wood fired stove. We left still hungry and spent over $60. My meal ended up being close to 17$ for a small salad and small piece of salmon. Way too overpriced. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for BBQ in the Pineville neighborhood. Also the brunch Pizza is delish. Rarely ever a wait.... Even on Sundays. Outside seating, a nice bar and it attached to the mall. DOUBLE SCORE!"}
{"text":"Well it was girl's night out and we all wanted to try somewhere different. Harper's had a very cool vibe. It has the open kitchen, wood fire oven and diverse menu so we were excited to give this place a try.

We were seated immediately our waiter was very nice and very funny but lacked the attentiveness I expected. We got our drink orders and he said he would be right back, and we waited and waited...and waited some more....ugh 

Well, that gave us plenty of time to review the menu. There is a little bit of everything here steaks, chicken, ribs, burgers, salmon and of course pizza. 

So here goes:

For our appetizer we chose the lobster end artichoke dip. It was really good nice lumps of crab and artichoke, but the portion seemed really small for the price.  But it was still good enough for me to order again...but not to share (hehe) 

For the meal I ordered the special the Oriental Chicken pizza which has chicken, lettuce, wontons, mushrooms, red peppers (which I didn't get) and honey ginger dressing. Welp, it was just ok. I mean I really like the crust! It was thin and crispy and flavor from the flame grill oven was great and the honey ginger dressing was good. But it just didn't know my socks off. 

My friends both had the salmon one honey glazed and the other blackened. With a side of mashed red potatoes. Now that was delicious! Comparing both, my absolute favorite was the honey glazed. It was just the right amount of sweet to not over power the salmon but give it really good flavor. It's a good thing my friends love me because I pretty much ate half their salmon....I mean to be fair I shared my pizza! But they agreed, that it was just ok but not outstanding.

I'm sure that I will comeback and give them another try... If only for that honey glazed salmon!"}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit when I visit home . I love there pepperoni pizza . The thin crust is just perfect! 
But recently tried something new and tried the ahi tuna . It was paired with cold peanut Thai noodles and baby spinach salad."}
{"text":"After shopping at the mall all day, my friend and I came to meet her fiance for dinner. I was able to reserve a table on Open Table about an hour before dinner, and I'm glad we did. On a Saturday night the place had a wait. 

We were immediately seated and I noticed they had $3 Blue Moon on tap. Any special on Saturday is noted for me. I ordered the salmon and substituted mixed veggies for the asparagus only side it comes with. When we got our food the salmon was delicious. Very good, but it didn't have a sauce that came with it, and when I asked they didn't have aoli. The veggies were peppers and onion and some other types that were grilled. I like my veggies more well done, and these were still very crisp. If I were to order them again, I think I would ask for them to be very well cooked. 

Overall, I would come back again. For a date night because it is a little expensive."}
{"text":"I am honestly shocked at the reviews I just glanced over. My boyfriend and I just had dinner here and it was such a fantastic experience that I hopped on here immediately to write a review on the drive home. I mean, it was FANTASTIC. 

We only waited about 5 minutes to be seated (LOVE when that happens on a busy Saturday night) 

Then, the best part of the evening, our waitress came by. Brianna was her name and she was absolutely wonderful. She knew everything about every item on the menu, and was just beyond pleasant. Seriously, servers make or break my dining experience in most cases, and she definitely made it. Next time we go, (I'm not kidding) I'm going to ask that they seat us in her section if she's there. She's THAT amazing.  

It was like she was reading my mind when she asked if I was interested in trying the daily soup (potato cheddar) because I REALLY wanted to try it but didn't want a bowl of soup. She brought me an adorable little cup of soup and OH MAN it was good. It was creamy, just a little spicy, and had the perfect amount of crunchy little scallions to add some texture. Then, the real food came out. My boyfriend got the brisket which comes with your choice of BBQ - vinegar based Eastern Sauce, or ketchup based Western Sauce. He chose Eastern, and it was SO good. The brisket was cooked to perfection and he devoured the mashed potatoes and slaw he got for sides. My burger was REDONK. I mean, I ordered a burger, so I expected just a burger. I read the menu and saw that it had a Hickory BBQ sauce and cabbage, so I thought, \"yum, BBQ burger\" but I was NOT prepared for the deliciousness that graced my palette. I can't even describe how this burger tasted. They found some kind of magical combination of flavors that had me going \"oh my..\" in between every bite. I know it sounds ridiculous to say so many things about a burger, but I am so serious. Then, my boyfriend ordered a cappuccino (which Brianna made herself), and he loved it. 

Now, you guys know what the atmosphere is like so there's no point going into too much detail. It's awesome. I absolutely love being in this restaurant. The lighting is intimate but abundant and the tables are perfectly sized and spaced. Table spacing is a HUGE bullet point for me, and I have never been unhappy with a table here. 

Overall, the food was ridiculously above par (even better than the other times I've been here), and I am SO glad we got Brianna as our waitress. Job well done, Harper's."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic restaurant! I love the atmosphere, location, service, and great good."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim with two friends while we did some last minute shopping at Carolina Place. It is pretty much the only restaurant walkable from the mall. We had a hard time deciding what to get because the menu is rather limited.

 We started out with the crab and artichoke dip. It was an alright dip but it came with things to dip in that were kind of weird. We couldn't decide if they were supposed to be pita or chips. They had a weird floppy tasteless consistency. My friends got the tacos and I got the fajitas. The fajitas were kind of disappointing. They were on par with what you get a Chili's. The tacos were the same. Essentially this is a dressed up Chili's, but with a little higher price points.It appears that they change their menu seasonally. They should expand their options and improve their recipes instead of changing.

Service was excellent. Environment- very dark and dim."}
{"text":"Small menu, hard to avoid dairy.  Next time I'll make it on a Wednesday so I can try the Brunswick stew.  The hot bar at Harper's To Go next door reminds me of Mac Kelly's in Chicago so I'm looking forward to going back there for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Went here with a group (6 total). The food was all awesome ... but the service was a 2/5 at best. Our waitress couldn't tell us what was in their cocktails of the day, and I think she may have even forgot to put our food order in initially because they brought out our salads and appetizers at the same time, and then the entrees came out 5 minutes later before anyone was ready. Then we waited 30 minutes for dessert to arrive. 

Bottom line: good food if you've got time to kill with nowhere to be."}
{"text":"We had excellent service today in the bar area this afternoon from your bartender (didn't catch her name, but tall and very friendly with dirty blonde curly hair in a ponytail). She was extremely accommodating and apologized about delivering our drinks late when it really only took her about 5 minutes to bring them to us. The food was also delish and came out quickly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Nice selection and food was good. Great for a casual lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I food is good just your average bar and grill. I have eaten here twice and each time the food was good and so was the customers service."}
{"text":"This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too."}
{"text":"Always have a good meal here.  My favorite dish for lunch are the fish tacos.  Great tasting and the beans and rice that are the side dishes are excellent.
My friend said the pulled pork was very good, and I tasted the sweet potato fries which were nearly perfect!"}
{"text":"Rather standard over all. They do have a very large wine pour at the bar. It gets very busy, I think due to the moderate price and good location. If you are looking for a sort of ...  regular place.. this would be it..  which is odd, because Harpers also owns Upstream and Zink, both of which are much better offerings.. they also owneed ARPA which was a failed tapas bar in uptown..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good!  We went here for my daughter's birthday and it was great!  All of the food was above par, the service was incredibly nice and accommodating and the ambiance was low-key but classy.  She loved it completely, and if you can get a pre-teen jazzed about a restaurant then you're doing pretty good.  I find myself usually gravitating toward their specials.  Yesterday's special was a local tomato stacked with avocado and crab meat.  YUM!

I will give you one warning though:  BEWARE THE COOKIES!  Harper's chocolate chunk cookies are a pure slice of heaven.  We bought a dozen for 15 bucks, which sounds pricey unless you consider the cookies are double the size in width of those two-dollar cookies you get in the mall and when they come out they are ooey and gooey and sooo warm and yummy!  The only problem with them is they are the child equivalent of fifty cups of coffee followed by a shot of pure adrenaline.  My smaller kids SHARED a cookie and bounced off the walls for the rest of the night!  Very worth the money, but WHOO BOY, the kids get hopped up on those things!  It won't stop me from getting them again though!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Harpers after a busy day of  shopping at the mall. We we're greeted and seated immediately. It was a Sunday after 5p so we were surprised to have prompt attention. It seems like restaurants are packed to capacity around that time in the area nonetheless our server was nice. She was a little shy and not quick to answer menu questions.  It warranted up by the end of the meal. My water glass had water stains on it, so I opted for a lemon drop martini instead. It was decent. My fiancé and I opted for the crab cakes. They were also decent. Very rich and not lump as they were advertised, but they were edible and flavored well. We both had loaded baked potatoes which were phenomenal. They were pipping hot and as you ate it the cheese continued to melt, so every bite was nice and cheesy. Definitely the staple of the meal. The overall feel of the restaurant was casual and laid back. We felt a bit overdressed for the atmosphere. But all in all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"So when i went there we waited for a seat and it took 5 minutes and when it happened  she just did someone else and i was mad it took 30 minutes do make chips and at the end it took 15 minutes to put berries in a cup so thats all"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Spinach dip seemed like thawed frozen spinach warmed enough to get the couple sprinkles of cheese melted. Wedge salad was acceptable. Steak and fries with Gorgonzola green onion butter was a miss (fries were good though). Ordered steak medium and came out very rare and bloody. The quality of the meat itself was catering grade. Wife had a salad and the chicken was overdone, black and dry. Food overall seems of low quality or processed. Surroundings and ambiance is very nice. Service was overall good."}
{"text":"On my recent visit to the Charlotte area, I thoroughly enjoyed our Sunday brunch at Harper's. I'd love to go to have dinner on another visit. The decor was tasteful with a visually appealing bar and view of the open kitchen. Our party of six included two small children and the waiter's attention to our needs was top top notch. He brought extra items for the kids when they were fussy in addition to handling the adult's requests. The service overall was amazing.

I started out with a simple greyhound cocktail and the juice was fresh and flavorful. I was surprised to find this ordinary drink incredibly flavorful. As visitors from the north, we tried biscuits and chicken and waffles and chicken. Both dishes were fabulous. Another member of our party ordered the pizza. I tried a piece and was impressed with the thin crispy crust balanced with tasty toppings. We even ordered a luscious piece of chocolate cake as take out to share later.

The place was bustling. So I'm glad we had a reservation. We were seated immediately--a good sign that reservations are managed well. We would have been in for a long wait without a reservation. My only negative comment is about the noise level. The noisy atmosphere did take away some aspects of the wonderful overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Pro's:
Service
Comfort
Cleanliness 
Chicken and waffles were extremely tasty, the waffle and Chicken were both nice and crisp on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. The tenders were nicely seasoned and dipped in a nice flavorful batter.  Their ranch dressing is also delicious (my preferred dipping sauce for tenders)

Con's:
$17 for shrimp and grits that lacked flavor and had about 5 extra small shrimp and about 7 paper thin pieces of sausage.
My sons pepperoni pizza was cold and lacked lacked flavor... I've had frozen pizzas that taste better than what he was serviced
My daughters Mac and cheese was barley warm, lacked flavor and the texture and consistency of it was unappealing."}
{"text":"Lunch was ok. I have the Baja fish soft tacos. I wasn't really impressed. Didn't even finish it. Price is higher for what we call lunch. Waitress wasn't as tentative as we would like. Hope its just an off day."}
{"text":"Harper's has amazing service and good food. The thin crust pizzas are amazing. I also love the pasta. Great prices for high quality food."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience here a few days ago. My husband and I were seated right away and put server was at the table almost instantly. We both ordered bar drinks that were very tasty and satisfying. I had the salmon with mixed veggies and my husband had a steak. Both entrees were cooked perfectly and delicious!! We were offered dessert but both declined. We will definitely be back when we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Food was bland and dry. Chicken Quesadillas was cheese and shredded chicken on a burned flour tortilla. Disgusting. My date had the Mahi-mahi and it was dry. Ugh. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a business lunch. A bit loud but still was able to speak clearly.  Ordered up some shrimp tacos.  Was warned they had a bit of a kick. They did and they were good!  Really enjoyed them.  Service was dead on too.  Def a place I would go back to again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I had the worst service at Harpers tonight. Service was lousy and indicative of how the service and food selections continue to slip.  I dine here frequently and tonight was a real DISAPPOINTMENT!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Loved the fish tacos but prefer flour tortillas not corn. Also great homemade chips and sweet potato fries.  Will go back when in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been dining at Harpers Southpark for over ten years. They once had the best patio in south Charlotte. No longer; first, the section under the vine covered arbor was converted to bar seating, now the wisteria is gone. 

Gone also is the consistency of food quality. Once a dependable choice for a good meal, it's now hit or miss. You can't even count on them having an acceptable sanitation grade.  Our lunch there yesterday may have turned us off for good."}
{"text":"I like Harpers.  I have not had everything on the menu, but what I have had has been good.  In particular, their flat-bread pizza appetizer is good, as are their salads.  I had a cheese pasta dish that was excellent, with some sharp cheeses in it that surprised me.

The bar is large and they have several beers on tap, including the heavier ambers and imports I like best, as well as a few domestics/light beers.  I've had dinner at the bar a couple of times and service is great (but this was during a late, slow time for the restaurant).

Table service is generally okay, with mostly young people who are fine, but do not really know the menu deeply, nor are able to make good recommendations.  (That's okay, because I don't really expect that at this kind of restaurant.)

There are not that many other choices in this immediate area (near the mall), so I say go for it."}
{"text":"Really surprised this isn't rated five stars. I'm in from out of town and this was right next to my hotel at Southpark. Absolutely awesome service and the best damned burger I've had in a long time. Great beer selection. I'll come back ASAP next time I am in town. The pimento cheese on the burger is awesome. 

FYI... most food here is more upscale than the burger, but damn it's good."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Just not always the best service or quality. Nice environment & the brick oven pizzas are quick & great! Very warm & cozy but still that sports bar ambience."}
{"text":"I have been going to Harper's for years - YEARS, I tell ya.  Unfortunately I have noticed a marked decline in the quality of their food (at both locations).  Though the portions have remained relatively generous, I would rather have a smaller amount of better food, if that is what is required to up the quality.

After an especially harrowing few weeks, the boss decided to reward me for not going on a homicidal rampage by giving me a gift card for Harper's.  So, on a Wednesday evening right after work, off to Harper's I went to spend the balance of my gift card.  I say this only in that if I were spending my own money, rather than the boss man's, I would not have ordered a steak at Harper's, I would save that for a steak place.

Their menu is on the smaller side, but it contains a variety of beef, chicken, pork and fish dishes.   I decided to splurge and try their prime rib served with a loaded baked potato ($25).  It was an inch thick, medium as requested and looked delicious.  Upon cutting into it - bleh.  Tough and chewy, and the dull knife was not helping out.  I had to saw at the piece of meat to get bites cut and immediately dipped it into the tasty au jus (salty meat juice, yum) to get any kind of flavor.  It honestly tasted like a hunk of meat taken off of the roast beef carving station at some kind of buffet.  Harper's isn't a \"steak\" place, but I expected better.  The loaded baked potato was delicious.  

For dessert, there was a \"homemade\" pumpkin cheesecake ($6).  It was fine, nothing special.  It was not very creamy, and not very pumpkiny, but that might be a personal preference of mine as far as cheesecake consistency and flavor goes.  I wouldn't bother to order it again.

My server, Tonji, was spectacular.  She kept my ginger ales coming and continued to check on how my meal was going, without being interruptive.  The manager did stop by and ask how the meal was and I should have spoken up, but I hate being \"that girl\".  

I have spent all of the $50 gift card and wouldn't intentionally return to either of the Harper's locations any time soon - the meal from the Carolina Place location on Saturday was mediocre and the dinner at the Southpark location on Wednesday wasn't anything to write home about either (though the wait staff at both locations was quite good). 

(Another piddly comment I have - wait staff shouldn't set up in the rest room changing clothes/getting ready for shift and gossiping.  As a paying guest, I shouldn't have to shuffle around them to get to a stall and then again to wash my hands.)"}
{"text":"Oh, Harper's, your dinner tonight lost you a *star* - both in rating and patronage - it will be a while before I return.  

Ordering the BBQ combo with ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork, which is served with fries ($19), I was hoping for the smoky deliciousness that I could smell after exiting Barnes and Noble next door (which convinced me to stop at Harper's instead of going to Peckers for wings).  The meal arrived and holy moly - that is a lot of meat (that's what she said).  I was pretty darn excited until I started actually eating.  The ribs were dry - and I don't mean dry rub with no sauce, I mean dry as in no moisture.  The pulled pork was also dry and the tiny cup of BBQ sauce that was provided wasn't going to help that out.  The beef brisket was moist, but a little too fatty - the brisket was my favorite of the mediocre trio.  Fries were fries, a little limp but I may have only had 10, not a big fan of fries.  Cole slaw tasted fresh and crunchy, quite good.  

Total tab was a little over $20 before tip.  I don't feel I got a $20 value from my meal, for 1/2 of that I could have gotten 10 delicious wings from Peckers and for a few dollars more I could have gotten a juicy prime rib from Firebirds.  Overall, I have always enjoyed my meals from Harper's, but I will stick to burgers and that type of food if I return, their BBQ combo leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. I got chicken and waffles and wasn't impressed. The chicken is breaded in Italian spices and a thick batter. It wasn't the best combination with the waffles. Seems they tried to fancy it up but it was not very good. I ended up eating the chicken by itself and a few bites of waffle by itself. 

Service was good, have no other complaints. Just don't get the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good/decent,but the service is so lousy,the waiter for our table seemed lost,I asked for juice he brought me less than half a glass of pineapple juice later I asked for a glass of water ,the guy just disappeared never came with the water."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 star effort.

Hungry for a healthy meal (I've been a bad boy lately....spank me!), I was at the Pineville Mall and opted to skip the fast food court in favor of Harpers. Got the wood roasted half chicken with spinach (skipping the normal loaded baked potato) and it hit the spot.  Nice thyme seasoning though a tad salty. But it was a healthy alternative to cheese, burgers and fat!

So I left happy......maybe the Auzzie Shiraz had something to do with that. :-)"}
{"text":"They were good. They have a varied gluten free menu and even offer a couple of gluten free cocktails. My waitress was very friendly. Also, they mistakenly cooked my fries in a non gluten free boiler. My waitress came out to let me know what happened and that my fries would be a little late as they were cooking another batch. I appreciated her letting me know. They even gave me a free dessert for the wait.
Great service. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"We always go to Harper's for dinner on Sundays when we visit my grandmother in Charlotte.  It's a great place to go after eating a gigantic brunch earlier in the day since there is something on Harper's menu for everyone.

The restaurant is warm and cozy and not too loud.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  Despite a brief awkward confusing moment where our waitress thought my grandmother was a lunch regular (which she is) that orders 7 & 7's (she doesn't), the service was decent.

I ordered the steak salad which is delicious.  I'm sure it's not the healthiest salad between the fried onions and blue cheese dressing, but it was definitely yummy.  It came with a small square of cheese bread which was to die for. I'm pretty sure they put honey between the bread and the cheese.  My grandmother enjoyed the chicken oriental salad and my mom polished off her entire roasted vegetable pizza which was HUGE.

This restaurant is always consistent and good - I look forward to coming back on future visits."}
{"text":"From ten years ago when our first grandchild, a girl, was born we have been fans and regulars at Harper's.  Am surprised that I have taken them for granted, ingrained as they are regularly in our minds, that I never have rated them.  A warm cozy interior, fires blazing in the kitchen and the red brick walls are really inviting.

When the granddaughter's brother was being born, my wife the grandmother took the girl for lunch.  The girl liked it so much that she said that Harper's would be their (grandmother and granddaughter) favorite and special place. And so it continues to be.

I think everything I have had has been good.  Portions great.  The pimento burger is special and though you have to wash your hands after eating it, the goop is finger-licking good.  Their pizzas are good, the sandwiches are a great variety and are good meals.  You can choose from burgers, clubs, pulled pork, prime rib, tacos, salads, fish, pastas, beef brisket and lots of sides, like mac & cheese.

Service is very good.  We have never had a problem.  I especially like that they refill the iced tea without being asked and that if we want a modification or substitute it is OK.

Have never had dessert as I am usually stuffed, so cannot comment.  But desserts are on the menu.

Harper's remains a special place."}
{"text":"Tucked into the Carolina Place Mall, next to the main entrance, is a smaller version of the Charlotte location.  Same great menu, service and atmosphere, just smaller.

We come here regularly with son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren because it is clean, everyone can get something they would like to eat and there is a good bar. The servers are excellent.  They are prompt, friendly and will make substitutions.  And even more important, they will bring the meals ordered by the children first, rather than bunching them with the adult orders.  Helps to keep the hungry children occupied and happy.

Truly a family place and 97 year old dad can order a side or a child's portion of macaroni & cheese which is more than enough to satisfy him.  A side order is a small cup, child's order is a nice bowl.  And the mac cheese is good."}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is average. Outside seating is lovely when the weather is nice however, watch out for the bumble bees hovering over the Wisteria and buzzing around your tables. Their crab dip tastes great but it is heavy and the ratio is a bit off... not a lot of dip for the amount of bread they give you."}
{"text":"Really good burger! Fries were greasy and limp, but tasted good. They could have been great. Service was terrific - attentive and friendly. Just right. But, the general dining experience needs work. 
While a  lively atmosphere is great, the noise level in this place is ridiculous. It's an open kitchen and the folks there dropped sheet pans like it was a game! The wait staff sorts silverware by throwing the pieces into bins right next to two rows of tables. And, the rock music blasts at ear-splitting volume. Make sure you are seated as far from the service area as possible. If that's not possible, leave, and if you care enough, come back another night. It's a real shame that the management and staff seems completely oblivious to the uncomfortable atmosphere they're creating. It's an easy fix. Just make the restaurant about the customers, not the staff. Containing noise is an easy fix. Someone in charge, make it happen."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Busy lunch. I ordered the brisket sandwich. It was a little pinker than I would normally get but that's ok. I didn't like the amount of fat on the meat. Overall servers very attentive and nice (and cute)."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one night with a friend and it was just ok. We ordered their guacamole for an appetizer and it was nothing special, very bland. I ordered their five cheese penne pasta without meat and it was fair. It tasted like a standard pasta dish from any other restaurant. My friend ordered the veggie burger and was pretty pleased with it. The atmosphere was dark which is nice but the decoration reminded me of eating in an Applebee's. I doubt that I would go here again."}
{"text":"I love Harper's! The atmosphere, the wood fire smell, the service and the Food are all Excellent. The Sweet Potato Fries are Addictive. I love the Streetside Taco's, the Pizza and the BBQ is fantastic! I definitely recommend Harper's to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place has changed and not for the better. Food menu is limited (1 salad on the menu) and it's all over the place.

We came in on a Friday night, there was no wait so we were seated quickly. Started off with the BBQ nachos and margaritas. The nachos came out fast and cold. They were also greasy with BBQ on one side, oily chips and greasy cheese settled on the bottom of the plate. 

Loved the old Harpers but this current version is not so good"}
{"text":"Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends."}
{"text":"Completely ordinary. Pricey, and small portions. The same owner's Mimosa Grill in Uptown Charlotte is much better."}
{"text":"This is one of the best dine-in restaurants in Charlotte. Their menu is awesome (right now they have a bison and wild boar burger that is so good) and it is all made from scratch every day.   Their wait staff is great too.  Highly recommend the Southpark location.  I have never been to the Pineville one."}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ sandwich anywhere around!  And, I love the buns they use, delicious."}
{"text":"We eat here every time we are in Charlotte.  Good range of food and staff is very accommodating.  I usually get their pulled pork sandwich with the vinegar based bbq sauce.  I have felt the last few times the portion of pork has gotten less, but I still fully enjoy it."}
{"text":"Update:  I have revised my review because I was contacted by their general manager, William Morris, after he saw my review.  He has already taken action by removing the open late sign and identifying and talking to his staff to prevent this from happening in the future.  He invited me back in to make things right and I plan to give him the opportunity since he has taken such initiative and made such an effort into making things better.  Management's efforts and engagement have definitely improved my opinion and earned them a less critical review.  

Wish I could give them a zero.  I came in one evening (5/21) after my niece's choral performance, so it was late (9pm), but it clearly says in neon on the outside \"open late\" and it also says online that their hours are until 10:00pm.  We walked in and there was not a soul in sight out front.  There was someone in the back/kitchen putting saran wrap on food.  We waited 5 to 7 minutes as a gentleman (manager?) was briskly walking around in the back right of the restaurant behind a glass wall thinking he would eventually get out front to us. He saw us but still did not come up front.  A few minutes later, he walked up to us, brazenly looked at his watch and then at us.  He half tossed a small menu to us and said, \"this is what we have now.\"  He then walked off.  We left and went to the Applebee's in front of Carolina Place and had stellar service, warm food and a hospitable manager.  This could be the last restaurant in Pineville and I would never go back."}
{"text":"This particular location is pretty hit or miss. I am still nostalgic about the old location on Woodlawn and the quality of the food. Just isn't the same, maybe they sold? The penne pasta with Italian sausage is the only thing I'll order if I go. I've taken a bet on some of my old favorites and have been really disappointed. Price is kind of high for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Came here the first time in May and the service was bad.. the food was terrible.

Was dragged here a second time in July and we waited 90 minutes for our food, and i'm being generous in calling it that.  This seedy saloon only knows how to prepare greasy bar food - they just don't have the ability to prepare anything healthy.  The server gave us our appetizers for free and apologized for the problem in the kitchen.  The beer was warm..  

Next time i'm going to Veto.. going to this fast food bar near the airport until they get their act together.  I would have simply ordered a salad but they all are very over-priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a Southpark staple for forever. I remember coming to eat here 20 years ago when my family first moved to Charlotte.  

Always good food, but it is a limited menu and a little pricey for what the food is.    Great atmosphere with lots of intimate booths. You can see right into the whole kitchen from the dining room.  

Convenient for take-out.  They have spots right out front to park for people picking up."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one day, we were so excited to start off with a carafe of mimosas. Then, the excitement slowly disappeared as we waited on someone to come to our table and greet us...and we waited...and we waited. And nothing :(. When we left we told the hostess that no one ever came to greet us and she just shrugged. Unfortunate because we wanted to mix-up brunch! Looks like we will stick with Flying Biscuit! Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"More like 2 1/2 stars for the price

A few years back whenever I was in town I'd have at least one meal at Harper's in South Park. The place always feels extremely comfortable to me, it's like home away from home. The right amount of brick and wood, the right amount of bustle and noise, lively but not raucous. The service is the way I like it efficient but not obtrusive. The American comfort food was of good quality and well worth the price. 

Flash forward to now, the tasty grilled Portobello sandwich is gone. The smallish 11 oz  prime rib is $20 and comes with only one side. Keep in mind that  prime rib is ALWAYS very fatty, I trim about 1/3 rd of it.  What was left was less than 1/2 pound. Worse is that I asked for the fried sweet potato and it's now the frozen, pre-seasoned fast food type where it used to be simply real potato. 

The prime rib was as rare as I asked but -as it's often the case- the chef had rubbed way too much salt on the slab before cooking it and there's no desalting it. Most people do like it prepared that way but what about those who don't or who have to cut their sodium intake? 

It's way too obvious that it's a franchise and management cuts way too many corners for the prices they charge. Physically it's still the same location but the food is like Orlando, FL.

Then I think about the Texas Roadhouse. I hate that type of theme restaurants with peanuts, overly cheery (and overly young) servers ... but know what? For those same $20 I got a large 16 oz prime rib every bit as good or better as Harper's, a couple of decent sides ( the sweet potato was baked but it was a fresh potato) they threw free appetizers at me and we drank five buck Margaritas or Martinis. 

So the place is messy, full of kids and has no class but the economy is tough these days. For my money I'll get my beef (or smoked pork chops) there instead of Harper's. Wow, I would have never \"thunk\" this"}
{"text":"Harper's. Great place. Good food. Knowledgeable staff. Had the Cajun omelet for lunch on Mother's Day Big crowd, but staff did a wonderful job. I will return."}
{"text":"With so many great restaurants in Charlotte/Pineville, why on earth would anyone go to Harper's Restaurant? We had a gift certificate and ended up throwing out ALL of the food! Simply said, H O R R I B L E! ! ! Yeah, so inedible we made sure we got a refund. DON'T GO THERE!!! I'm sick to my stomach just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I give it three stars based on the service not the food. Came in a Friday before the lunch crowd and sat at the bar for a quick bite to eat. Took several minutes for the bartender to breakaway from a conversation with other servers to acknowledge I had sat down. That's pretty much how the meal went - bartender more interested in chatting with other staff or texting on phone. Food was great. Had a simple club sandwich. That was fast to arrive at the table and was cheap."}
{"text":"Showed up at this place around 8pm after flying in from San Diego. (long flight). This place was just what i needed. Not loud, comfortable setting. They had a few good IPAs that we're local yet drinkable. I had the grilled Canadian Salmon with veg. Excellent ! Salmon was grilled to order. I had mine med. rare. I recommend it this way. Think i'll go back tonight & try something new. Ya, it's that good. Might come back & rate it 5 stars !"}
{"text":"This is a very popular restaurant. We learned that as we sat on the bench at Harper's on Saturday night, trying to get in. Party after party came in that had reservations so of course they were seated before us. But once we got in (after a 30-40 minute wait) our experience improved. We started with drinks and the Spinach Artichoke Dip. I ordered sangria, it came in a huge glass and it was delicious!! My friend ordered a mojito, it came in a small skinny glass. The spinach dip was a bit of a disappointment, it was on the dry side, not nearly as tasty as the same dip at Applebee's. :( 
My friends both ordered the BBQ pork sandwich, they both raved about it. You can order it eastern or western style. I ordered the sirloin steak and the loaded baked potato. The steak came grilled exactly as I requested and the potato was delicious. I also had a tossed salad with blue cheese dressing, the dressing was delicious, I am very picky about my salad dressings.
Harper's is a great restaurant to go with friends because anyone can find something to order on their American menu. I have to knock them down a notch because the side dish my friend ordered never arrived, but we overlooked it because the place was insanely busy."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, went for a business lunch.  Everyone raved about the crab and artichoke dip and their entrees.  I had grilled salmon and it was as good as it gets. Ambience was nice and the service was efficient. I wish they had one of these in Atlanta."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite restaurant anywhere close to the Carolina Place Mall. You cannot go wrong with any of the BBQ. My wife can't bring herself to order anything but the pulled pork.

I love both the BBQ chicken and the pulled pork. I also really like the grilled mixed vegetables as a substitute for the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Attentive, not overbearing service.  Good sized portions.Husband had steak and fries. I had oriental chicken chopped salad.  Both pleasing meals. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a few years. Food was outstanding. We had the blackened chicken sandwich and quesadilla. Dave was server and he was excellent as well. Never intrusive. Very attentive yet professional. Best restaurant experience in quite some time."}
{"text":"Totally not what I was expecting... In a great way!  I had Applebee's expectations and my socks were definitely knocked off!  The unassuming restaurant is just outside of the mall which was convenient on the way home with a car full of hungry kids.  The server suggested burgers as that is what Harper's is known for, he explained but I opted for the chicken sandwich with a salad, my husband had a dinner salad with salmon and the kids had kid food ...pizza and maybe grilled cheese.  Everything was exceptional!  The chicken sandwich was cut into 4 which was awesome because the sandwich was quite large and it was tasty! Lightly battered and fried but not at all greasy.  The salad was fresh and delicious too. My husband was thrilled with his salad and the kids were quiet which was an indication that they were happy too! I will definitely be back for more tasty American food that was fresh and made to perfection.  The menu was simple and the desserts sounded good too so next time I will get something smaller to save room for the sweets"}
{"text":"We usually eat at the Harper's by South Park (where we have never had a bad meal) and the one in Greensboro (which we love). We called ahead to see if this Harper's had the same pizza menu, and we were told they did.  After waiting for a seat, we found out they don't.  
We had a horrible waitress, and people around us got their meals 10 minutes before we got our appetizer with part of the meal.  We let the manager know, and the rest of our order was brought out.
The bright side is the food was excellent like every other Harper's we've eaten at and the manager was very apologetic.  I think she was frustrated at the service we received.  We will give them another try."}
{"text":"Amazing Sunday Brunch! Party of six and all were very pleased. Food was amazing! My chicken & waffles were perfect. Decor was kind of upscale, and yet prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"So so, the barbecue was not anything to write home about and the fish tacos were ok. If your starving at the mall, not a bad choice. Service was pretty good. Another chain joint with chain joint food."}
{"text":"the food was tasty! we split the chicken sandwich and the pesto pizza, both were great!  The service was ok, but could be improved."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. We ordered the hummus appetizer which was delicious. My husband has the ceasar salad which he thought was very fishy tasting and the chicken pasta which he said was delicious. I had the wedge salad which was awesome and the rotisserie chicken and grilled vegetables which was super yummy. Service wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Harper's isn't my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, and it's not even my favorite Harper's Group restaurant (that honor belongs to the consistently amazing Zink).  However, if you feel the need for a wood-oven, red meat, cheese, and potatoes style dinner served in a fairly upscale setting, this is a good place to go.

The food at Harper's is consistently tasty.  It's not particularly exciting, but they do the staple well: burgers, pizzas, steaks, and so forth.  Their wagyu beef burger is pretty delicious; just be careful to stress your desired temperature to your waiter, because if you don't, it will come out well-done regardless of your preference.  The crab-artichoke dip appetizer is tasty, although they could give you a little more dip for the price you pay.  They make a good dirty martini, too.  

The service at this location is better than Pineville's, at least in my experience.  According to the little ad on our table, they have half price wine glasses on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"The food at this Harper's is as good as their South Park location; unfortunately, the service is not.

Don't get me wrong.  It can be really nice to stop in here for dinner after spending a Saturday at the mall.  It smells great and the brick-and-wood decor gives it a very anti-mall feel.  As Jeff said, the food isn't healthy by any stretch of the imagination, but it's pretty dang delicious.  I am quite the fan of the classic Angus burger.  You can taste the char on the patty, but it doesn't taste burned.  This is how Adam likes his burgers, folks.

However... I don't know if it's the volume of diners or merely the restaurant's employee culture, but the service is pretty unremarkable.  Your waiter will be polite; he will take your order promptly; he will bring you your food; then, he will disappear until it's time for the check.  This can be annoying when you're eating fries and need hydration.  He also might neglect to ask how you want your burger cooked, so make sure to tell him, or you'll get well-done."}
{"text":"Being near Carolina Place, it was time for a late lunch stop. The family suggested Harper's, and I had never been to this location, so I figured I'd give it a try. We were greeted by an unfriendly hostess. More on her later. The waiter introduced himself, and was an older gentleman. We got our waters and placed our order--dad and I were going to split the BBQ Chicken Pizza and Chicken Caesar Pizza, chicken fingers for the sister, and salmon for mom. 

Our food came out, and the BBQ Chicken pizza was pretty good! Although I'm not a huge onion fan, they weren't horrible. The Chicken Caesar pizza though? Dee-licious! Probably one of the best pizzas I've had. As I was enjoying it, I was rudely interrupted by the hostess dragging a chair across the floor. Nice touch. The lettuce on the pizza was fresh, and the garlic sauce was a winner. The cheese was more of a salad-cheese than a pizza-cheese, which I liked! Everybody else reported their food was good as well.

Service was very good, I thought our waiter was a very genuine gentleman, and had a smile on his face the whole time. Thumbs up. Overall, Harper's exceeded my expectations, and I would return next time I'm near the mall."}
{"text":"My friend and I headed to Harper's for a quick dinner before catching a movie at Phillip's Place. I was pretty pleased with the food at Harper's. And the menu has a lot of different American food options (burgers, salads, chicken entrees, etc), which is good for two friends who can't agree on a kind of restaurant for dinner. They also have an extensive wine list, and a nice bar area."}
{"text":"Went to Mothers Day meal at this location of Harper's today. Our reservation was for 2PM, arrived on time and promptly seated. That's where the good portion ended. I was tired of eating chicken for the last several days and spotted a prime rib on the menu. I ordered the prime rid medium rare and other members of our party placed their order. The wait begins:  The only item that was ordered that required cooking were the waffles, other items were prepared in advance. Forty minutes later our food finally arrived, not all at the same time, but one at the time. When my order arrived it was cooked to the level of shoe leather. Being hungry and was afraid that I would not get any food before it was time to I ate it. Bottom line:  Harper's is not the restaurant to go to to enjoy good food, next time I will go to another restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat at. Very clean, nice atmosphere, and super friendly staff. Everything on the menu is great but I almost always get their margarita pizza."}
{"text":"Day 1 of Restaurant Week. Husband & I chose shrimp cocktails (five nice, large shrimp) and wedge salads (nobody can make mistakes on these, although the core of mine had a little rust). My husband had the pimento cheese-crusted filet with loaded baked potato, \"quite enjoyable.\" I had the salmon with asparagus - the asparagus looked awful and tasted of burned grease and natural gas. It was limp at the tips, charred at the stems,  and left dark gray, greasy residue on the plate. Beth , our server, asked whether I would like a replacement, and she did offer other sides, but I really hoped that this was just a fluke on the first serving of asparagus, so I asked for a second order of asparagus. Second serving was as bad. Worst side I've ever been presented with at a restaurant - TWICE! INEDIBLE! Salmon was alright, I think, but I had that gassy, greasy residue on my tongue from tasting that awful asparagus that interfered with the rest of the meal. For dessert, I had mousse, but it was more like ice cream. Husband had key lime pie that he said was \"good.\" Definitely not the meal I anticipated, and if not for Beth trying to make things better, I would have dropped the rating even more."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but overly priced in my opinion. We started with the dip duo app. The pimento cheese is very tasty. The guacamole was bland. A little salt could've helped. We shared fish tacos, a margarita pizza, and chicken tenders. Everything was good. But everything was $14+ for lunch items. We finished with the chocolate cake, which is amazing."}
{"text":"Average food with a few exceptions. Above average prices.  

Waiter was excellent (Darius), but terrible hostesses.  hostess gave us a 20 min wait, we waited 30, they buzzed us.  We go up and they tell us, oh, it's like 45 min more probably.  THey really need to sort that out, we had a large party and we just barely didn't walk out.

Highlights: Waiter Darius.  The crab artichoke dip was great.  Braised beef short ribs were superb.  Decent wine selection.

Personally I'm going to try a few other places around, for the money I expected more"}
{"text":"I miss the old menu. We came to the Pineville location tonight and just had a beer and left because the new menu is more pub style food. Gone is the NY Strip and many of the other larger portioned dishes. Also, not having mashed potatoes is pure shame. Maybe I'll try for lunch, but not a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"We visited during restaurant week. The menu  had such variety we just had to try it. I got BBQ chicken pizza, prime rib and key lime pie. The pizza was big for one person and good. Too many onions but still flavorful. The prime rib with loaded potatoe was cook prefertly and very juciy. The key lime pie was 3.5 stars out of 5.  My has the pecan trout and pepperoni pizza. He said they were excellent."}
{"text":"Queen's Feast summer 2015 is a success! We had the FOUR course meal and it was excellent. We both got the Harper's salad, which is a BLT with egg in a bowl. Excellent. 

Then we ordered Danish ribs(?) and the hickory grilled ribeye ($2 up charge). The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The grill cook knows how to use the fire appropriately, and that's a hard skill to learn. The ribs were tender and the coke slaw was actually good. It's usually too sweet or too onion-y for me. Not this time. 

Finally, our server, Katie, was on point. She didn't hover, but we never wanted for anything. Overall, it was a great date night."}
{"text":"I gave this place a two not so much for the food and presentation but the overall experience.
As an out of town traveler, and probably any restaurants worst critic, I am very observant to service and quality
First I would like to add the smell of hickory BBQ in the place is fabulous but is quickly extinguished by the poor lack of service.  The bartender / server, not busy with guest or serving was not attentive, \"where's Waldo?\"
This place is in a mall \"where's parking?\" 

Personally have had much better and next time in Charlotte not picking Harpers"}
{"text":"An average experience for above average prices.  Did a Sat night walk in.  We were seated quickly inside...place seemed busy.  I ordered bbq ribs and pulled pork platter; date had fish tacos.  I thought the ribs were good, the pulled pork was pretty dry.  Date remarked that she enjoyed enjoyed the tacos and they were very good.  Waiter was ok but did not refill drinks quickly and was generally not as attentive as he should have been.  Nice venue but we will not be back."}
{"text":"We really like Harper's and right after Village Tavern is our go to dining. We like just about every other place in Charlotte have had an Issue here and I warn you, the wife ordered a steak prepared a certain way and the waiter brought it out cooked Hawaiian or something along those lines and the kitchen told him to bring it to the table and offer it to her.

Really she ordered it prepared one way and you want to bring what she did not order to the table? Mind Blowing.

I told the waiter do not let the kitchen jeopardize your tip by offering what the customer did not order. 

The biggest part about this was that the ease the restaurant offered us the wrong order knowing it was not what we ordered. So it brings 2 questions to mind:

Do they make a lot of these mistakes?

Do they offer the wrong order and people take it?

Management may need to get a hold of their kitchen staff and make it clear how they need to pay attention to detail and serve ONLY what was ordered.

Okay, I understand if they did this why the 4 rating? Well we have been here 5 times, you get 3 strikes in my book before you are out. and 1 out of 5 visits is not a killer.

Just focus Harper's you have potential but as my standard for Customer Service \"Devil is in the Details\"

PS

We did go one other time and the wife's steak was cold and had to be sent back for warming."}
{"text":"First time going had a HORRIBLE wait time during lunch... The manager comped my food, but for a quesadilla a 30 minute wait is crazy since it's an appetizer.  I will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"First, a man who I thought was our waiter came up and said \"Can I get you something to drink?\" and abruptly walked away before I could answer. He proceeded to take empty glasses from another table, and I didn't see him again. Then our actual waitress came over and took our orders. I ordered the roasted spring vegetables and the baby back ribs. The chef completely doused the veggies in vinegar and they were extremely sour. The ribs were a little too dry. 

While eating my ribs, the waitress came over and explained how I could eat them.  ? Not really sure why this happened. 

I won't be going back. Brazwell's is sooo much better, and the prices are better there too."}
{"text":"Harpers has been around since the mid 90s and has yet to disappoint.  My only complaint about the place is their prices.  I realize you are paying for eating in an \"upscale\" restaurant in the South Park area but I still think it's over priced. Expect to spend about 15 dollars a person at lunch.  I've tried many things here over the years but their menu has also changed many times.  If there's something that's no longer listed on the menu they are happy to make it for you.  We always start out with the dipping trio. (No linger on the menu) Pimento cheese dip, homemade salsa, and spinach dip with plenty of chips that they will refill for free if you run out.  The angus burger is delicious and comes smothered with pimento cheese.  Anything with pimento cheese on JT at Harpers is delicious. I believe they even have Mac and cheese with pimento cheese in it but it is no longer on the menu so ask about it. Their chicken tenders are always a hit with the horseradish honey mustard.  I've also been a long time fan of their chicken Caesar salad.  Lots of craft brews on tap.  Different drink specials everyday.  It's a nice place to check out with fairly quick service.  Open kitchen and ample parking. Check them out!"}
{"text":"GREAT Burgers and Beers and college football. Awesome service! They know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"A favorite for sure!!! Sadly we don't get there nearly enough as we try our best to avoid malls at all cost!!! The menu offers a variety of appetizers as well as entrees. I have noticed a few reviews state the menu is limited, we don't find that to be the case. We've been with both adults as well as toddlers we've yet to have issues pleasing anyone in our group!!! The crab-artichoke dip appetizer with freshly made chips is wonderful!!! I think we've tried just about everything on the menu with no disappointments!! Hands down our all time fav/go to choice is \"six cheese penne pasta\", it's certainly not for the fat gram counters. I am not a fan at all of any type of \"white cream sauce with pasta\" meals, EVER!!!! So not the case with this, it is also more than a tad \"heavy on the bacon and sausage\", no worries as the six cheese penne pasta is even better without those! Just be sure to request they be left off. Serving sizes are more than huge both my husband and I have a second full meal the next day and then some. My only suggestion would be a smaller side salad, they do offer a lettuce wedge salad type that again is on the very large size. I suppose one could share the lettuce wedge, I'd still like to see a small tossed salad offer. All very \"first world\" type \"problems\" I'd say!! One can't do wrong with anything menu offering."}
{"text":"Harpers is good, when you just want to have a prime rib steak kind of night, with baked potato or sweet potato fries. 

I came by here on a Thursday night, and they hosted a trivia night! It was fun!! Sadly, with my new work schedule, I have not had an opportunity to come back on any Thursdays."}
{"text":"The fare is consistent each time we go...there, of course, is a lot to be said about a high volume restuarant like this.  Its conveniently located in the mall albeit parking can be unaccomodating (this last comment is for those that have a problem simply walking a little further accross the parking lot).  I generally get a burger and the meat is consistently tasty and prepped to my request.  My wife and kid's enjoy the fairly broad menu options too."}
{"text":"Lunch: Harper's Classic Club. Delicious. Great service. Nice atmosphere. Convenient."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for Sunday lunch after a visit to the mall. This place was okay. Nothing spectacular but not bad either. Prices were decent for the most part. I decided to order the burger with pimento cheese with the mashed potatoes. The burger was large and well cooked. I was expecting the cheese to add a bit more to the burger than it did. The mashed potatoes where a bit under seasoned but tasted homemade. Service was ok but not the best. This will be a good spot to stop by when you are visiting the mall and want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good was pretty good.  We had the Burger and the Margarita Pizza.  We came in Sunday and you only have access to the Brunch Menu.  Would have liked more options as we were looking for lunch."}
{"text":"I went at lunch,  had 30 minutes. Never been before. First off, I noticed  the outdoor patio, and wished it was warmer so I could sit outside! Looks like it would seat 20-30 at least. Second off, I was greeted by three people when I walked in the door, and sat immediately. It's an open-air kitchen, and if you sit close, you can watch what's going on in there. Smelled FANTASTIC.

I ordered the chef salad, I had heard they were pretty big.... Huge salad! Delicious, fresh and being a bacon lover-was pleased to fond thick pieces of perfectly cooked bacon throughout the salad... with bonus tempura-style chicken slices and avocado! Could only eat about 1/3 of it.

Service was a bit slow but friendly. Not an in and out place, but great if you have an hour for lunch. My only complaint besides timliness was the relentlessly screaming child that no one bothered to take out of the restaurant that was clearly distubring everyone trying to have their lunch."}
{"text":"We have eaten here alot and i looove their pizza and tonight was the best. I had it to go and this time the dough was a little ticker than normal and it was amazinggg. Who ever you had cooking the pizzas tonight they need to share their technique with all the others there. The service is always impeccable when we go there and the food is always spot on. If you are looking for a great family restaurant or a night out with your significant other with exceptional food and service this is the place."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this restaurant. Sadly, when I tried it, it was nothing short of very disappointing. I was there for brunch with my wife and we ordered the eggs Benedict, hers with spinach, mine was traditional.   When it arrived, not only was it cold, both came with no hollandaise sauce.  How is that even possible?!  Upon asking for a side  of hollandaise, we got a lecture that there actually was sauce on it but it had dissipated. That I don't need. When I left, I noticed that there wasn't anyone working in the kitchen that seemed older than 25.  Kitchens need an adult."}
{"text":"Honestly, I really enjoy coming here. The atmosphere and the food is good. However, this is the first time I've arrived and was told that the kitchen closes an hour before the actual establishment closes. ? I arrived at 8:08pm to be informed that the kitchen closed at 8pm but I can go to the one in Southpark that closes at 10pm. I was very disappointed.  I may or may not return after this. 

UPDATE: Management was very kind when reaching out to me. He communicated clearly their policy and what \"I\" was to expect moving forward as a customer. I greatly appreciate him looking into this matter and promptly addressing it. I love when companies protect their brand while making sure that the customers' satisfaction is met. Way to go Harper's!!!"}
{"text":"Very well priced. An bargain chain steakhouse with subpar meat, tough parking/access. Real chain feel from moment you walk in. Rather just go to Reids & cook at home."}
{"text":"Always a great place! Remember going as a child at the original location on Woodlawn! This place is great always has been. Quality service and quality food. The chicken tenders are hand breaded and have been my favorite since a small child! The honey mustard is delish! For a more grown up taste ;) try the pizzas or pimento cheese! Yum!"}
{"text":"Having had lunch here for quite some time during my time working on this side of town, I can confirm this place is a solid place to get some grub.  Always a solid menu of items ranging from BBQ to filet mignon.  

Recently I popped in for dinner with the family and order the filet and it came to the table on a bed of wilted spinach.  It was the perfect temperature and the spinach was perfect.  My girlfriend got the ahi tuna dish and I must admit I had a bit of entree envy going on.  It came with a side of thai noodles and was presented a lot like a plate of sushi would be.

The staff was nice and pleasant and catered to our table with speed and accuracy.  The only drawback I have for the place is the acoustics.  It's a bit loud in there almost all the time."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations in just a few weeks and was extremely happy with each. I love their premium margarita. Pork nachos are great. Don't be nervous-get the spicy ones. Hummus and Ahi Poke are both great. Their version of Spinach Dip is good. I like the cracker type pizza skins they serve for dipping. Starter salads are large - perfect for sharing. On both occasions I had the Grilled Salmon. They prepare it to your temperature and don't miss on the mid-rare. I also had Brussels Sprouts which are probably the best I've had ever. At one location the plate also came with mashed potatoes. We did the Chocolate Chip Cookie dessert. YUM! The menus are slightly different from the Mall to the South Park location. South Park seems to have more high-end entrees. Plenty of selections and a nice array of choices at both."}
{"text":"Good place. I stumbled into this restaurant because there was a 2 and a half hour wait at the cheese cake factory (Really?!) Well good thing there was a long wait there because I wouldn't of found this great restaurant. We sat at the bar because I wanted immediate service. The margarita is strong and delicious. They don't make it with sour mix(it's a miracle!!!!) fresh lime agave and tequila. I will be back for this drink. The food was yummy. I had the fish tacos. I feel that they could of had more fish. The rice that came with it was good. I'm not a fan of rice but I gobbled this stuff up. The black beans were alright. For dessert I had key lime pie I really liked the texture and crust. I had a chance to sample my friends brownie it was good. The bathrooms were clean and it was my kinda spot.  The great thing is it's located in a shopping mall area so you can walk off your calories and there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I had the chef salad.  They give you a lot of salad and I had my chicken blackened and grilled. My friend order the crab meat with avocado and sent it back because there was only a litttl bit of crab so basically all you got was a to mate slice with a crumb of avocado and crab meat, definitely not worth 13 bucks or even 5 bucks. She needed up getting a salad like mine and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was not pleased with the service that I received and I was not satisfied with the value. I highly prefer the Pineville location."}
{"text":"I'm usually wary of restaurants attached to malls, but this place was a pleasant surprise. The smell alone is enough to get you in the door, and once you're in they don't disappoint. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I was surprised at how tasty it was. This seemed like more of a steakhouse/casual dining place but they came through on the barbecue. The only suggestion I'd make would be a better selection of sauces (the \"eastern style\" bbq sauce wasn't much different from the vinegar you'd put on a salad). I shall return."}
{"text":"My man friend and I had dinner here on November 16th around 7:00pm. Prior to dinner, we both were feeling fine, which is important to know considering what happened later. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, the 6-cheese pasta, and some wings, which were covered in a sauce that was not described on the menu.  Dinner and service were fine nothing spectacular but not bad either. We were having a great conversation so we ordered dessert-the chocolate chip cookie skillet with ice cream. This was very good! However, around midnight we both were feeling sick. I am a lady so I will spare you the details. Let's just say our bodies did not like the food and was getting it out!  That night I was so glad we don't live together- but that's another subject. 

The following morning, I called the restaurant to inform them what happened and spoke to Steve. He wanted to know exactly what we shared & even implied our sickness would be a a quick reaction to food poisoning. He said he would talk to the chef and call me back. I have not heard from him. Perhaps he should know FDA.gov, staphylococcus aureus can cause illness 1-6 hours after ingestion.  So we know something in this restaurant made us sick!  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Harper's is a good-ol' Southpark institution. It's a comfortable facility in a great location. The food is American grill fare ranging from salads to hamburgers and several entrees of the usual descriptions. My guest had the hamburger with pimento cheese. Seeing it made me wish I had gone all out and ordered a hamburger. He said it was definitely divine. I ordered the salmon salad which was pretty good. The salmon portion, a bit small, was served on a bed of lettuce with an Asian dressing and oddly because of the dish it was served in, it was sort of hard to eat.

And if you've read some of my other reviews, I am definitely tuned into serving \"rules.\" For goodness sake, don't reach across me to pour water in my glass if you are able to go to my right. How hard is it to train your servers to follow the basic rules?"}
{"text":"This place was OK, nothing too different than what you would find at a local Applebee's or TGIF. Service was good, food was good,just nothing to drive out of your way to get to. What I did order was the blue cheese burger which was very good if you are looking for a recommendation for something to eat. Otherwise, if you're at the mall and you want a decent sit down place, this is a good spot"}
{"text":"Went for a lunch middle of week and service was slow and food was just ok. I think its overprice for the quality of food you recieve."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Pennsylvania over two years ago, but we still have regular cravings for Harper's! It was our favorite restaurant when we lived in the Charlotte area! My two favorite things on the menu are the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Pimento Mac & Cheese, though absolutely everything we have had there is delicious. We drive home to Florida every Christmas, and last year, mid-way through a 16 hour drive, we stopped at Harper's for dinner. It's just THAT good!"}
{"text":"This is a very beautiful restaurant. It has a lot of items to choice from. We halved an order of the Lump Crab Meat and Artichoke Dip; and the Three Cheese Pasta. They were both very delicious; and a lot of food. I am glad we halved everything. The service was very fast and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and the beer. If I am ever in that area again; I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Terrific casual restaurant in SouthPark, with good burgers, sandwiches and salads. The Fish Tacos are particularly tasty! Service has been spotty, but it's  generally reliable. Add in a spacious patio for outdoor dining, and Harper's is fast-becoming my go-to place for lunch in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"We pulled into Carolina Place mall and the smell in the air really got our attention. Such a wonderful smell blowing across the parking lot. 

We asked several employees where that amazing smell was coming from. Surely it wasn't coming from Harper's.... or could it be?  We have a Harper's in Columbia, but I've never smelled anything like this smell before coming from our location. 

Sure enough that smell was indeed coming from Harper's. As soon as we finished our shopping we just followed the smell on into the restaurant. They have a Brick Oven. 

We were immediately greeted and seated in a nice cozy booth for 2. The menu was a little limited but there were still plenty of choices. I had the Caesar Chicken Wrap and Grilled Asparagus. My husband had one of the Brick Oven Pizzas. He cleaned his plate.   

The food was good and the service was good. This location is definitely better than ours."}
{"text":"The Chicago pizza is our favorite pizza of any place ever. The sausage is house made with fennel, the onions are carmelized and it is a super thin crust from a woodfired oven. I can't believe that the review that said this place was like Applebee's. No way. Not even close. The environment is wood and stone, warm and inviting with a separate bar area where you can also order food. Adequate beer and wine options and good specials every day. Convenient location and one of our favorite places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had the New York strip and eggs with hashbrowns. Steak was cooked according to request, but served almost room temp. The hash browns were very good. Great coffee. Service was inconsistent. The waiter seemed disengaged and got our egg preparation request wrong. He offered to change, but after a moderate wait, we were just ready to eat!"}
{"text":"This place has yet to fail me.

The service is prompt, friendly and courteous, and the food has always been spot on.

I want to try a few of the other specialties, but I am just hooked on the BBQ Chicken Pizza, and just can't bring myself to deny me the pleasure of such excellent food.

{"text":"This use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent.  I hadn't been in about 2 yrs though due to the quality/service had dropped.  So this weekend I was in the area and decided to give it another try.  I had the Ahi Tuna.  The tuna itself was good but the noodle salad had a strange  taste, like it was old.  The green salad was soggy, as if it had been sitting in dressing all day.   I never thought I'd say this but the Harpers @ Carolina Place mall seems to have upstaged this location.  Their food is always good."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for lunch.  I had the Ahi Tuna (yum) and my mom had the Chinese Chicken wrap with sweet potato fries.  She said the wrap was really good and refreshing. We both agreed their fries were the best we ever had.  They were hot and salted just right."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch once in a while and while I've experienced some service issues in the dining room, I've come to appreciate sitting at the bar when I go alone.

The bartender, Carrie, is outstanding!  She always knows the menu and can usually make suggestions and tells you some interesting facts about the menu items.  Also, when she's busy she always comes back and apologizes.  So for Carrie alone, I'd give her 5 stars.  She always gets a great tip from me.

As far as the food, Harpers food is good.  The only thing I don't like is it's really not that healthy.  Even the chicken on salads is fried.  Sure there are some healthy items but on Harper's menu these are rarer than other restaurants.

I can't say I have a favorite here yet.  The 6 cheese pasta is pretty tasty but so are their tacos.  The barbecue is hit or miss.  All I will say is whatever you order, you do get a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I like it here. My wife and I have been here a number of times. Our first visit we were pleasantly surprised with it being trivia night. The past few times we've gone for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. I like the food here a lot. I'm partial to the prime rib (my wife is too) and the chicken and waffles were nice for brunch. The restaurant is pretty clean and the venue itself has a typical American restaurant dining room vibe. Our service is usually good, sometimes just alright. I've had salads and appetizers here and they're alright, but the prime rib will keep me coming back. I definitely love their prime rib."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night. I wanted the quesadilla but our server informed us they were out of those because of the earlier football game. It's ok it happens. I ended up with the salmon and a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese is more like noodles and cheese soup. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, however I felt like it was so bad for me I couldn't justify eating it all. They could use more noodles and less cheese. Oh well.  The salmon was perfect.  My cousin ordered the veggie burger which looked like a real burger, but it was in fact a veggie burger. The fries also looked delicious. Perfect crunchiness.

Overall, our server was appropriately attentive and refilled my water all night which was good because I was pretty dehydrated lol."}
{"text":"We sat outside on their patio after it had rained all day.  The manager came & pulled out the cushions for us and the bar waitress took great care of us.  My friend and I just got drinks and appetizers.  The black bean soup came with sour cream and some hard boiled egg crumbled on top and it looked yummy, she said it was great.  I had the chili, which was a little sweet and heavy on the kidney beans and light on the meat, but it was tasty and I wasn't hungry enough to complain.  The patio is very nice and it has trees around it to screen it from the gas station and traffic of Fairview and it was a very pleasant way to spend and hour or so catching up!  It is the smokers place to go though, so if you are highly sensitive it could be bothersome at times, but we didn't have a problem with it."}
{"text":"Sometimes when you can't think of anywhere else you want to go, you go to Harpers!

This is a much nicer bar area than the one in Southpark.  I thought that at first, but the bartender was rude and dismissive and we had to chase him down for our drink orders and check, which is annoying because we are sitting in front of him at his bar and were two of four people there at the time.

I might go back, but I'd probably walk out if I saw the same bartender."}
{"text":"I've been to Harper's twice in the last few days and I'm in love.  I use to eat at Harper's a long time ago when it was on Woodlawn, and I gave it another chance when I was out at the mall the other night.  I had the wagyu steak burger, first time ever trying this burger and it was amazing.  I had it with the bbq baked beans, and of course fries it was just great.  So good that I ate there again this past Sunday and had the same thing just delicious oh yeah and also their tuxedo cake it was really beautiful as well..lol.  Didn't care too much for the service I got Sunday but other than that it was great."}
{"text":"Always love the one at South Park & food is the same here. However service is not. Also we were charged for some one else's tab & had to wait 10 mins \"until they figured it out\"...
then they did not give us a copy of our refund nor did they give us any compensation for our inconvenience. Not too happy & I will be watching my account for the refund."}
{"text":"Service is excellent.  Every time.  Food is just ok.  The brisket is totally juicy and fabulous but everything else I have had there is just ok.  They have a gluten free menu which is nice.  Honestly though I just go back because its convenient,  They need some more exciting menu items....."}
{"text":"Good service, good food.  Our first time here.
Blacked mahi mahi, hubby liked.  Hawaiian pizza special, came with red peppers, which I thought was weird, and I dislike bell peppers so it was an unwanted surprise.
Our sweet server offer to have a new one made, and the second one was very good. I'm not a fan of flat bread crust, but this had a great sauce and flavor.
I also had a side order of grilled veggies... sound strange but they were the bomb- smoky flavor."}
{"text":"Was here towards the end of the dinner rush on a weekday. Attentive but not overbearing service. Sat in the bar, so a bit noisier than the restaurant, but not overwhelming, definitely allowed for privacy. Nice sized restaurant, comfy booths, dark lights and modern music. 

Pizza was great, really crispy crust and nice and spicy sausage! Had the pimiento crusted steak and baked potato as well - steak was marginally undercooked, but had excellent flavor and was well seasoned."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Harper's! I was thinking it'd be like a cross between Chili's and Applebee's...you know, either way, you're not going to be entirely satisfied, and you'll likely walk out of the restaurant feeling worse than when you walked in. But no! 

I had the Sicilian pizza, with prosciutto and some other salty tastiness. My sister got the Chicago and had no complaints. The only thing I would ask is for them to put the descriptions of the pizza on the menu. If I hadn't asked the server what came on the Sicilian pizza, I wouldn't have ordered it. Same for the Chicago, which is an even more deceptive name since pizza, when the word \"Chicago\" is involved, has a different meaning. Our server explained very well what all the toppings were, and was attentive to our needs for the most part.

Aside from there not being enough information on the menu, my family and I had a nice experience. I'd be happy to come back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I ordered BBQ pulled pork sandwich and half of the pork was very dry. The sandwich fell apart after first bite which made me look like a messy eater. I ordered two kids meal for my son just in case he didn't like one of them. Either of the kids meal was good. The chicken finger was the worst chicken finger I've ever seen. It was sloppy inside (almost felt like it wasn't cooked thoroughly), and the seasoning they used was kinda wired. I have 3 stars only because my husband seemed to enjoy his dish. For my own experience, 2 stars."}
{"text":"The BBQ plate was phenomenal. Our server brought me all three types of sauces they have because I could not decide which to order and all three were excellent. The food was prepared in decent time and the service was great. Well worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Nicer than the usual casual dining places and easy since it's connected to Carolina Place. They had a NY Strip special and I knew they cook on hickory wood so I gave it a try and it was great. Most items are reasonably priced and the dining area has a nice ambiance. I've got a place to eat at the mall now since Tony Roma's closed (RIP delicious ribs and bread)."}
{"text":"I love this Harpers.  The location is convenient and I was already in the area dropping off my ring, so I met a friend for a day beer and lunch.  It was snowing outside and this location is just a comfortable vibe.  The bar is a nice size and has many cocktail tables for easy seating.  The dining room is decent sized and has a number of large circular booths, which are really nice.  For lunch I had the steak salad.  It was a bit pricier for a lunch salad, but I figured I would give it a shot.  It was a little bland for my liking and didn't have enough toppings to justify 15 dollars.  The lettuce was almost grated, which made it really easy for eating, but the lettuce to steak/mushroom ratio was way out of proportion.  My friend had the hummus and a side of the garlic parm fries, which were amazing.  

Next time, I want to try that BBQ Chicken pizza everyone has mentioned!  Overall a good little spot for a cozy comfy dinner/lunch.  The service was great.  Next time your in ask for Laura!  She is an amazing server who goes above and beyond for a great guest experience.  Overall a nice little spot to dine anytime of day with great service."}
{"text":"Solid choice. We came in for Brunch on Easter Sunday. It wasn't super crowded which was nice for Easter. We were looking for breakfast type food. The brunch menu is small but we both ordered off of it. I got the chicken and waffles, my boyfriend got the quiche and smashed potatoes, and we both ordered coffees. The coffee was fresh and was good. My chicken and waffles were really good. The waffle was crisp and light, served with 100% pure maple syrup. The chicken was excellent, the breading was herbed and very light, almost a tempura like consistency. My boyfriend's potatoes were really good. They had onions and peppers all mixed in, very delicious. The quiche was light and airy. The BF said he's had better, but it was still really good. I would try this place again for Brunch."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant tonight, and as an avid foodie I was extremely disappointed. When my food came, it was cold. Not even warm, but actually cold. Now I ordered the top sirloin and mashed potatoes, and realized it was cold after the first bite. A waitress came over and took my plate back to the kitchen. The manger came back out,with my plate 5 minutes later. First thing... It was the same food! I have NEVER been to a restaurant in my life and had a problem with the food and they brought the same food out to me! I own my own catering company, and that is an absolute no-no! If someones food goes out wrong , you make another one. Additionally , my steak was supposed to be cooked to medium, which it was, so if the chef tried to warm it up, it would have gone over. I must admit though that it was not over... because it was still COLD! So it goes back again and come out about 10 min later and the new steak is swimming in a pool of blood b/c it didn't rest. I don't know what kind of training your manager has, but that us not how that situation should have been handled. This experience completely turned me off. I won't be eating here again. Hopefully your Southpark location doesn't handle things like this."}
{"text":"I went with an old friend that I had not seen in a long while. The waiter was very young and a bit clueless. The restaurant is beautiful but the menu is limited. I really did not have the stomach or the pocket book for a $30.00 prime rib. I would have liked to see more female friendly dishes such as some tapas type dishes in the 10 to 12 dollar range. As it turned out, we both had the chicken noodle soup and a loaded baked potato simply because the menu was so limited to larger meals. 
Other than that, a pleasant experience !!"}
{"text":"Alex at the bar is the best!! Great attitude and personality. Love that you changed up the music and are now playing more modern songs and the new specials. Only thing we miss is the OMB Draft Friday night special."}
{"text":"We tried to come here at 8pm on a Sunday, but apparently that is a \"late night\" time for them. The dining room was closed and the bar wouldn't serve us much of any food, so we left to go to a restaurant that actually wants to serve food when it says it is open."}
{"text":"I've seen Harper's sitting there across from South Park Mall for quite some time. I've been to the Pineville location before.  But until recently, had not stopped into this Harper's.  It's upscale without being stuffy, and a great place for a dinner out.

You can find many of the standard American restaurant offerings on the Harper's menu: steaks, burgers, pizzas, chicken, and the stray pasta dish. The food is great quality, with wood -fired and blackened dishes being a house specialty.  The hand-made pita that comes with the crab dip is very tasty, though I wish there was more dip for all those pita chips. The chicken and beef dishes are both well prepared, with that great smokey flavor.

While I did not eat on the patio this visit, I was very intrigued by this location's arrangement. It seems to be \"covered\" by the trees that surround it, and I would imagine is a great (and busy) place to dine during warmer months."}
{"text":"Great dinning experience at Harpers that I shared with my coworkers on Thursday evening. We started with cocktails at the bar and the tender was a fabulous lady who served us well. Dinner was outstanding- I had the tuna and crab stack to start and had the veggie plate- Brussels, asparagus and balsamic tomatoes for dinner- yum! My counterparts enjoyed Mac n cheese, pastas and salads with salmon, and we all were pleased. Our service was fantastic. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good bar. Great appetizers. The tuna app was spectacular. I had the steak & fries and it was delicious. Waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"Harper's has changed their menu since my last visit and I'm not sure its for the best.  
We visited on a Friday afternoon and was surprised that it was almost empty.  

We started the visit by ordering the dipping duo (creamy spinach and pimento cheese).  Keep in mind that Ive been ordering this appetizer for over 15 years.  When it came out, I was completely let down, as they'd completely changed the recipe.  The spinach tasted like steamed spinach and you couldn't even taste the chopped onions.  When I moved the dip around, half of the bowl had warm water on the bottom.  The pimento cheese now has jalapeños in it and it super spicy (it used to be a true southern pimento dip with a hint of pepper). Our waitress was kind and allowed us to switch out the spinach for the guacamole.  In my opinion, this dipping option is not worth the price ($11) because the taste isn't there anymore. 

I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad (not on the menu) with Caesar dressing on the side.  The breast chicken used to be blackened but this one looked like it was shredded chicken instead and was dry. 

For dessert, we ordered the brownie with ice cream.  The dish looked beautiful when it came out but upon further Inspection, was truly a let down.  It looked and tasted like a little Debbie's brownie that'd been warmed up.  

I will say that the service was very good and at the end of the day, it wasn't our waitress' fault for how the food tasted.  

Im very disappointed as Harper's has been one of my favorite restaurants for well over TEN YEARS.  I have never minded their prices until yesterday.  I walked away paying $50 for a lunch and was overly disappointed because I felt that I could've gone anywhere else and have been more satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the exact same thing-- honey mustard salmon with sweet potato fries. Does not ever disappoint!"}
{"text":"A good go-to spot. Not always the fastest service but the food is seemingly always fresh and they sure do make some killer desserts - 6 layer chocolate cake? Yes please! It's super kid friendly and that's a requirement for my family - the waitstaff are attentive but sometimes have too many tables which can make refills or issues a challenge. I prefer lunchtime over dinner as it's a bit less chaotic."}
{"text":"The food was good but the shrimp and grits are not good. My sister had to send her order back and it took nearly 25 mins to get her new order of chicken and waffles. Now the manger had to come and bring her food and offered us free deserts. That was 40 mins ago! Never again!!"}
{"text":"For some reason this restaurant had fallen off our radar and we have just picked it back up.  I like the Original Chicken Oriental Salad and my husband likes the Brandon's Spicy Prime Rib Sandwich.

Great \"old\" brick work.  Even though its a newer building it makes you feel like you are dining in a historic building.

Great for LUNCH and BRUNCH"}
{"text":"Went with my mom in law and husband. Hostess was receptive to our necessity for a booth since it's easier for mom to get in and out. Ivy was our waitress. She was very prompt in her service. Husband's beer was good but the pour was very messy. As for my Rosè I was pleased. Mom's cod plate was a good portion for her and she thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband's burger was messy but he liked it. My salmon burger was missing bacon and that live hickory taste that I was anticipating. Our fries were clearly leftover- very soggy. Nonetheless it was a decent meal. I wish the ambiance didn't feel like a nightclub. Please choose better music. Bottom line, is this my last visit? No. I'll try again. Will I order the same thing? Nah, I'll try something else enticing."}
{"text":"Loved my fried chicken and honey buttered biscuitswith cheesey grits plus with extra side of fruit. My iced tea was good as well. I can smell the smoked wood outside the building and could smell the steaks as well on the grill. Very flavorful aromas.  Everyone's dish was looking right down to the Brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream. Wow. Yes I will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to go for brunch. Harpers had excellent service and a minimal wait for Sunday brunch. The French toast is some of the best you will ever eat and the hash browns are an excellent side choice."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I got the blackened salmon medium well and it was good, the squash casserole was good, but you must be a cheese lover to enjoy.  My company got the brisket, said it was a little dry but still good and the veggie mix was very good.  I am a picky eater and would recommend this restaurant. Good array of a menu selection to cover a mix company. Service was steady and not over the top.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"OK ---- Here we go.  Queen's Feast is to test drive restaurants you don't normally visit. We visited Harper's (after a long break) MISTAKE. They were out of all potato product other than French Fries. My dish included a Baked Potato -- nope French Fries.  Nancy's dish was to come with Asparagus first time so tough my steak knife couldn't cut it..... they brought more. Again too tough that we couldn't cut it. So she asked for mashed potato's. NOPE OUT.  So they brought coleslaw (now mind you my wife likes coleslaw)....this was so thick with mayonnaise that even she (who loves Mayo) couldn't eat it.  Then we were presented with a full bill with an $3 up charge for my steak...... WHAT? Queen's feast is your best foot forward. The steak was good .....but not that good. Nancy had the Salmon good but again neither of us got the side we were supposed to. Only after we complained did they offer a discount. Manager only approached when the first side was bad. JUST WOW. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  I enjoy the pimento cheese burger. It's not 100% consistent, however. Sometimes it's not as good as others.  The prices are decent. The service is usually good."}
{"text":"The food is good. 
My local favorite for those quick \"business\" lunches or a good dinner as a resonable price for the area. 
Steaks are ok, but the more lite fare is better here.
Brick oven pizza is very good and so are the salads. I try to get something different everytime but so far the Brick Oven Ceaser Pizza was by far a favorite. 
Like the warm setting and the open kitchen too."}
{"text":"I ordered the same thing as my friend. The pulled pork BBQ. Waitress said do you want it as a platter or a sandwich. I asked what is the difference between the two what comes with it. She said the only difference other than the bun and lettuce and pickles. The platter has the cole slaw on the side and the sandwich has the cole slaw on the sandwich. Both come with a side. We both got fries as our side.  Same amount of pulled pork as what was on the sandwich. But the platter cost was $5 more but less food. I got the SAME THING only without the bun and lettuce and pickles. WHY did it cost $17 instead of the $12 that was posted on the menu. I could see if you got more pork but you don't. ALSO when I asked what was different she left out the fact that it was $5 more. That's 42% higher. WTF?"}
{"text":"Ate here for restaurant week. It was great! I had a ribeye steak with a loaded baked potato. The steak was slightly overcooked, but still very tasty and juicy. The potato was really good as well. I'll definitely be going back. Service was really good and I really liked the vibe in this place. This is definitely a place to bring visiting friends and family coming into town."}
{"text":"Always enjoy going to Harpers. Service is great and the TY's crispy chicken sandwich is always great. Fresh ingredients and great sweet tea. Only issue is the coke tastes like the lines need to be cleaned out."}
{"text":"Great food, service and location in South Park. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner. They have daily drink specials including 1/2 price wine bottles on Monday, 1/2 price glasses on Tuesday, $5 LIT on Thursday and $5 Margaritas on Friday. 

The restaurant is very clean and comfortable. I love eating here."}
{"text":"Went to brunch Sunday. Walked in, strong smell of smoke from their grill. They let your know about it the minute you walk in. I almost wanted to leave because it was almost overwhelming. We split the omelet and crispy potatoes, which were not. Way too much seasoning like oregano and rosemary. Came with little biscuits. The end."}
{"text":"During restaurant week they only do that menu, which was a little disappointing because we went for their bar bites menu. Luckily they worked with us and let us order the sliders and Thai pizza. They went out of their way to make us happy, which is always nice when you eat out. Food nothing special, but for a bite out not bad."}
{"text":"We visited Harper's during Restaurant week and it was excellent. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait and there was indeed, a 30 minute wait. Our waiter was great, food excellent and everything came out at a good pace. My friend and I both had the crusted trout and it was dreamy...along with the hummus and crab appetizers. I thought the dessert was going to be one of those tiny samples, (because of restaurant week) but it turned out to be more than I could eat. Wonderful experience and we will be returning in the near future.

{"text":"Love the food, but either 
a) they don't do take-out...which this site and theirs says they do or 
b) they never answer the phones (I've tried multiple times without success)"}
{"text":"I have had the occasion to eat at Harper's Southpark several times in my life. It was good but not over the top, gotta get me to my YELP account good. Yesterday we had lunch at the Carolina Place Mall location and it was a Get to My Yelp Account visit. 

To start, you gotta love the smokey smell as you walk in. It sets the mood for a comfy well cooked meal. This can backfire for a biz if the food doesn't live up to the ambiance set up by the smell. NO probs there!

We were seated immediately as it was just at the beginning of lunch and lots of folks were still in church. Our waitress (I wish I had thought to get her name) was there quickly and was super friendly and helpful. 

I got the Streetside taco's, 2 brisket and one chicken. (Not a fan of fish taco's but they also were available) They came on 6 inch flour tortilla's and were packed! I seriously enjoyed the chicken one and the brisket one's were close behind. Even my not being a slaw guy, they had the slaw, brisket and cheese and the contrast in flavors and textures made me giggly! I, as always, ordered jlapeno's and hot sauce, to compliment them and it was delightful. I got a loaded baked tater for a side and was PACKED full by the end of the meal. 

My wife decided on the 6 cheese penne pasta. I scouted the room while we were looking at the menu's and it looked delish. To the point, it was! I could only see the slight lack of salt as a minor prob, but that is easily remedied. I got several forkfuls because, like the taco's it was a serious portion of food.

My little girl got the chicken fingers and had to fight off the roaming fingers of her old man who ws trying his best to get a second bite. Light and crispy so you could really taste the chicken but enjoy the flavor of the herby coating. We were shocked when our waitress told us that a lot of families send them back because their kids are happier with a McD's style nugget! WRONG!! BAD PARENTS!!!! My son was so taken with them , he ordered a kids size chicken fingers to go along with his adult sized buttered penne pasta (which BTW, had some serious fresh ground and flaked parm cheese on it, I thought his head would burst!)

I do have one con to report but it is not a deal breaker for me, just a pet peeve I have about food delivery. Harper's (at least this location) is not a tray place.  That is to say that the food (ours and every table's food) was delivered by hand by the servers and runners. This can be a nice touch but as a restaurant gets busier during shift, the availability of help gets thinner. We got to see servers carrying several plates at a time and having to base the plate closest to their body against their body. Several of the lady servers had the plates jacked up under their boob for stability. Now I am all for boob food, but maybe in a more  intimate setting! I find nothing wrong with a server bringing a tray to the table for service. I did notice that drinks could be trayed but during our meal, no food on trays. Just a note, really and I wanted to say boob-food!

We will go back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. 

It feels like TGIF's or Applebee's but luckily it tastes  better. The chicken tenders were different but the two sauces it came with, barbque and mustard, were on point. You get an ass load of food here for what you pay for. My server looked at me like I was nuts when I told her I was finished because it barely looked like I put a dent in my meal. 

My server was friendly and cute and kept my drink filled. The food came out lightning fast and she was ready for the check when I was."}
{"text":"One of the best places we've found. Service is almost always 100%. We've had everything from pizza (Margarita, Pepperoni, New Orleans...all awesome) to filet mignon. Awesome pork sandwich and their fries are seasoned to perfection. Filet was expensive for a 6oz but was worth it. Melt in your mouth. My 5 yr old ordered a sausage pizza and didn't like it because of the fennel, I was going to make her eat it but they insisted on making her a new one with pepperoni instead. One of our go to places when we don't want to try somewhere new and be disappointed. Oh and their chips and guac!!! Boy oh boy. Now I want some Harper's !"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Not too great. Staff was friendly enough but the food left much to be desired. Nothing beyond mediocre. We discussed food tasted re-warmed and more like catered wedding food that had sat out for a bit of time. Presentations on plates looked awkward and haphazard. Amount of food was decent, just not the best. Somehow after the meal, we left wanting more food. Not that we were hungry, just that the craving of good food was not met. That's okay, they do mean well, and I know the restaurant has a long history in the Charlotte area, but hopefully they can step it up a notch to keep their name associated with positive things."}
{"text":"Friday night, trying to decide where to go -- it's been a while, let's go to Harper's.   We usually go during warmer weather as the have a nice patio.  The food and service is always good.  We sat in the restaurant tonight, my only issue is the noise level is high, so difficult to have a conversation, and I'm going deaf, so that did t help.  We both had the salmon with vegetables.  The food is prepared well.  I think the prices are a little high for the food-value, not so good.  This will be a place to sit outside, share some wine and a flatbread."}
{"text":"I've been to Harper's three times on business lunches and thought it was time for a review.  This place does a lot of things right, and it's another one of those times that I wish I had a half star to give out.  If it weren't for being a little overpriced, this would be four-stars, so take that as you may.

One of my favorite things here is walking in the door to that wonderful smell of a wood-fired grill...can't beat it.  The salmon they cook on that grill is just as good as the smell:  always cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  Their pizzas are decent, but oddly, I find them to have too many toppings sometimes.  They would benefit from less, so you get more of the dough and sauce taste.  The pulled pork is decent, but it has to be vinegar based with a double side of coleslaw.  They get a little stingy here with the slaw, and that can be a problem.  My favorite menu item is the portabella mushroom soup on Tue/Wed.  It is creamy, heavy mushroom taste, and very light on the seasoning.  I love it when the ingredient really shines, and this soup hits it out of the park (if you like mushrooms as much as I do).  

The service at Harper's is usually really good, they never let the drink hit the bottom of the glass, and they're not overly intrusive.  Atmosphere is great and the big boothes are perfect for a business lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Harper's in YEARS!  I was a little reluctant when some friends suggested Harper's but I decided to go with the flow and unfortunately, ended up pretty disappointed.  

They do a lot right so I don't want to totally bash them but the quality of food is just not up to par.  I was super hungry when we arrived so that should have benefited good old Harpers but apparently it was mind over matter and I have a clear picture of everything I tasted.

Quick Summary:

The dipping trio:
Salsa tasted like it came straight out of a jar...Harris Teeter or no...food lion brand.
Pimento Cheese--tasted like mustard with chunks of cheese in it
Artichoke and spinach dip--dry and flaky..had decent flavor but not creamy

The chips were thin and greasy and mostly small pieces.  

I ordered the Chicken Salad with some type of ginger soy dressing.  It was just ok.  The chicken looked like it had been shrunk...it was pretty dry.  It was basically like what you would get in a frozen fajita meal.  You know how the chicken is small, salty and fatty?  The lettuce was chopped but dry and looked like it came straight out of a bag.  The cucumbers, red peppers and onions that were supposed to be in the salad must have been playing hide n seek.  I think I had one piece of each.

Others are my table tried another steak salad, blackened chicken pasta and the burger.  Everyone pretty much had the same response...\"just ok.\"  In fact, my friend tried to justify her reasoning for choosing Harper's by saying, \"wow, I haven't been here in so long.  I remembered it being so good as a kid so I thought it would be fun to try it again.\"  Um, is that your way of apologizing?


The service was decent but our waitress clearly had a bad attitude.  She didn't smile once.  Half of the food for our table came out about 10 minutes before the other half so the manager offered us a free dessert.  I thought that was super classy because we didn't even have to bring it to their attention.  I can't complain about something that was free but I'll let you know we tried the warm cookie that came with vanilla ice cream.


I know Harper's is a family favorite for so many so I don't want to burst any bubbles and I can see why people like it.  They have a diverse menu, nice atmosphere for couples or for families, nice location, etc.  They aren't super expensive but I don't think they are priced right for their quality but that's just my opinion.  Overall, I stand by my 3 star rating...they are just \"a-ok.\""}
{"text":"A little pricey that's why I went with 3 stars. It's the kind of pricing you expect at a restaurant in an airport. The food is pretty good but not THAT good. 

I usually get a burger and their mixed vegetables. The brisket has been hit or miss. 1 time it was fantastic. The next, very dry. Haven't really sampled too much else. Wish they would add a gluten free bun option.  

The tables are roomy and they have a great bar. If you don't mind $20 - $25 per person for lunch, the I recommend it."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed, the menu was okay, very American, nothing on the lunch menu jumped out at me. I got a salad with grilled chicken, chicken was a little over done. The salad came with croutons, cheese, egg, bacon and cucumber. It was a nice portion. The restaurant ambiance was nice, reminded me of a smaller cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"So, I am not sure where to begin with Harper's. On my quest to find great brunch spots, that not only offer great food and great Bloody Mary's, I decided to check out this location today. Based on my experience, Harper's is definitely not one I will return to.
With a VERY limited brunch menu, VERY limited variety of alterations & a VERY rude & knowledgable, Lindsey, waitress, today's visit was so disappointing.
I started out with Bloody Mary. If you like horseradish go for it, if not stay away. I then chose the cheese and peppers omelette, with egg whites. Lindsay informed me they don't offer egg whites, really? Ok. I asked for a few more minutes to look over the menu. After ten minutes my waitress returned and informed me they could do egg whites. So, I chose the omelette. 
Overall, the food was ok, but the service was horrible and I would not return for that purpose. My search continues."}
{"text":"Wife and I hit this reliable standby for lunch yesterday when we could t decide on where to eat. Both of us are from Charlotte so we have gone to Harper's for years. It's food is good, consistent, and filling. It is not the cheapest ($14 for a sandwich or salad is a bit much for my taste usually) nor the most hip/cutting edge. But is always clean, good service, and relatively quick. 

I had Harper's Supreme Chicken sandwich ($12) w/ fries. Very tasty with a nice little kick from the Texas Pete aioli. A bit messier than I expected. The fries were fresh and hot and pretty damn tasty, despite being thinner than I usually like. But would definitely get this again. Great service, as usual, despite the lunch rush. 

So - I would certainly recommend Harper's to anyone. And, even though I didn't get it this time, you will be missing out if you don't order the Pimento cheese...on anything (including their mac 'n cheese...which is no longer on their menu so you have to ask for it - but you need to!)."}
{"text":"Have been to Harper's numerous times, but last night it seemed clear the place is slipping. Menu appears to have been pared back substantially (didn't see any pastas or side salads, for one thing). Service was prompt and waiter was nice -- but two people who promised to bring a bottle of ketchup were never seen again. Of our orders, the steak was a bit on the tough side and the salmon definitely was not worth $25. Ended up wishing we'd gone around the corner to Rooster's or Firebird's."}
{"text":"If you're finnicky about sanitation grades there's is 90. And there's a bunch of young host staff led by a much much much older lady that seems to sit people out of the order that they arrive. I was told that we couldn't take a booth because it was reserved for reservations. THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS!

The menu is very minimum.  Its down to just one page. I understand we don't  want to clutter our choices but I like having just a bit more to choose from.  Not the restaurant of my choice. I wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here after shopping in the mall and just wanted to sit down and eat some good food. The restaurant is okay it is nicely decorated. The food was okay, pricey for what you actually get. My toddler daughter wanted the cheese pizza which was an item on the kids menu and it was below average she did not like it at all it was very hard and not easy to eat. I ordered a strawberry margarita and the glass was the smallest glass I have ever seen for a margarita, I wasn't to pleased with that. The waitress was great and patient. I would say just try it out for yourself, everyone's opinion is different."}
{"text":"What a nonevent. I went there for lunch, it was loud, service was average, and the food was tasteless. 

Overwhelmingly Average!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Harpers. I've eaten there so many times that I can't even begin to recall what exactly that I've ordered, but I do remember that I've never been disappointed in any food that I've ordered.

The service is always prompt and polite and extremely attentive. The place appears to be very very clean and it's just like going home I've been there so many times. I just love the place. Many times when I've been in this restaurant, I've seen people that I seen there before so they obviously have a pretty good repeat business and that says a lot for the quality of their food and service"}
{"text":"Good meal! Fun place! We had the steak it was awesome and beef tacos they were very good and the slaw was excellent with them. Our server Alan was great too."}
{"text":"I lost my IPAD.

Where could it be?

Retracing my steps after I arrived in Raleigh I thought to call Harper's in Charlotte where I had lunch the day before. Apparently I had let my IPAD slip from my bag and I left it in the booth where I had dined. 

Thanks to the honest wait staff it was returned to the managers who I contacted and had the pleasure of speaking with Curtis Stevenson who took down my address and promptly mailed it back to me.

I appreciate Curtis taking the time to return my valuable tool to me immediately.
He understood my needs and took fantastic care of his customer.
Thanks Harper's and especially Curtis Stevenson!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just okay. Very dark atmosphere with many TV's. I came here to watch the womens NCAA final so I had a good choice of TV's to watch the game. The joint is a little dark but they have an outdoor seating area which is very nice.

I ordered the whole wheat crust Sicilian pizza. The pizza was excellent, cooked to perfection.

The wine portion was great. Full glass instead of the normal 4 ounces many places are pouring today..
  
Average price/value relationship but I would go back again to try another entree."}
{"text":"This review is based on one meal.  I ordered the veggie burger and was impressed!  One of the best veggie burgers I have ever had at a restaurant.  It was made in-house (none of that previously frozen brand named stuff).  Great flavor!  I don't know what was in it but it was good!  I did see some black beans in the mix.  Anyway, it was huge and hand shaped like a beef burger, grilled and placed on a bun topped with sauteed mushrooms (yum!) and melted aged cheese.  It was delish!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Harpers for years, and I've never had a bad experience until last night.  First of all, the menu has been reduced to one page which was shocking.  I ordered the ribs which come with roasted vegetables and slaw then I ordered a side of fries.  The ribs were not even close to fall off the bone, they still had lots of time to cook to be considered even tender.  The vegetables were not roasted, they were recently sautéed in a pan and consisted of zucchini, yellow squash, onions, mushroom and red peppers and were barely cooked and literally cold to the touch - one of the zucchini was literally still crunchy.  My last hope was the fries but they were not cooked properly either, limp and not crispy at all - HORRIBLE.  When the best thing about your meal is the slaw there is something seriously wrong.  I asked to speak with the manager - who looked like she was 19 and clearly had no business running anything.  Very disappointing experience and I wont return."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's right near where I work and I frequently head over there and pick-up dinner-to-go.  They have a pretty expansive gluten-free menu and everything I've ordered from there has been a big hit with the family.  Another perk is that the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Nicer restaurant attached to the mall. While the service was good and the atmosphere ok, the food itself could be served in the food court. Sorry but, it's a no."}
{"text":"This is a local franchise.
This one is connected to the Carolina Place Mall.

They have a decent menu with salads, sandwiches and pasta.
Several BBQ selections.
I had the grilled cod tacos. Dora had the patty melt, Ben had the chicken tenders, Deb had the hamburger sliders and Savannah had the PBJ sushi.

We though the service was really good and so was the food quality.
The Manager came by several times and checked on us."}
{"text":"Food was good, kids menu prices are great considering the amount of food. Service was horrible. We were sat close to the bar so the bartender was our server. Food arrived 7 minutes apart, drink glasses remained empty. It took 17 minutes for a kids ice cream to be brought to the table. Probably won't be back until I see a lot of good reviews on their service, too many good places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Tried brunch here instead of going to my normal places. The food was very bland. I don't even like salt and had to put salt and pepper on everything. The person I was with had a crabcake Benedict and the crabcake looked like mush. I wanted coffee but like real cane sugar in coffee because I don't like the taste with substitutes and that was the only option a customer could have.That will definitely be my last time going there for brunch. I think the Southpark location is a lot better."}
