{"text":"Adorable wine store and gift shop. The patio was a perfect spot to wind down date night on the lake. I purchased a few items, and my date and I split a bottle of Pinot. I'm not giving it five stars bc the only employee (owner perhaps?) didn't leave our wine with us, and she was distracted by other patrons. I can also see how this place would fill up quickly on the weekends."}
{"text":"A lovely, charming place with very accommodating staff, and a wondrous view of the lake! On the day that I came with a small group of my girlfriends, they were out of several of the \"by the glass\" items that we requested, but offered suitable substitutes. We did not order any food items, but I believe that they do offer some small bite items. There are several mini-rooms where small groups can gather for drinks and conversation, and bar seating is also available, though the bar is more quaint and cozy than most. Choose to sit inside, or outside when the weather is pleasant. Several wine-related items are offered for sale-browse the store while you enjoy your bubbly!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon The Cabin after dining at the harbour club. It was like walking into a friends home, quaint, friendly and welcoming. This is one of our favorite places! I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"We love this place for drinks and small apps (try baked brie!)
Very nice atmosphere, great service and awesome wine selection. 
We love Trudy, the owner!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff. Excellent wine selection. Perfect for a romantic evening or meeting friends for cozy accommodations and enjoyable conversations."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but it is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I was there for a wine tasting for my birthday today. Wine tasting was suppose to start at 6:30 and started at 7:15. It is now 7:51 and we finally got up and left. We received very little attention and when we left we hadn't even received our appetizer. We had only gotten to taste 2 wines in 30 mins. With a wine tasting that was suppose to start at 6:30 we certainly thought that 1 1/2 hrs into we would have been into the red wines and had our appetizers. The person doing the wine tasting was waiting on people on the patio and also checking people out. We got almost no attention. When we went to check out and pay for what we did drink he was the one at the register. I explained it was my birthday and that I certainly didn't get what I was expecting and that we decided to leave (I mean it's almost 8:00 and I am very hungry!). He was very nice and apologetic and said this was unusual. I had looked forward to coming here all week after the article I read so I am sad that it didn't work out"}
{"text":"We stopped in while we were waiting for our table to next door. The service was quick and plenty of options for wines to drink. It's a very dog friendly place and you can sit outside with your fur family member out front."}
{"text":"You can't beat a Sunday afternoon at Lake Norman Cottage! The staff is great, the wine selection is incredible and priced even better. It's the perfect place to sit back and relax while looking over Lake Norman."}
{"text":"If your looking to do something truly unique for a change check out the Lake Norman Wine Cottage.   My friend made reservations for a big group of us on a Saturday night - $20 a person get you 5 delicious wine tastings and dinner.  Not a bad deal huh? 

Did I mention they are right on the lake and you feel like you are sitting inside a bed and breakfast somewhere much further away then Lake Norman.

I really enjoyed the cottage the atmosphere was so cozy and the service was excellent.  We enjoyed finding out about each of the wines we were tasting and Trudi the owner made us feel so welcome.

Girls night out, guys night out, couples night out whatever it may be I highly recommend checking this place out you will not be disappointed.

*I do recommend eating a little snack before coming the food is ok but you will probably need a little more to soak up all that delicious wine."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends or just have a date night. Service is excellent, atmosphere is incredible, and the wine selection is to die for. The only thing that is disappointing, is that they do not serve any type of food or snacks. There's nothing worse than having an enjoyable evening but having to leave because you are starving."}
{"text":"So cute! This little \"cottage\" off the freeway and along Lake Norman is a sweet surprise and nice getaway from Charlotte to a loungey Saturday along the water. I come from a vacation town, so adirondack chairs and boat views is just an average summer day... but 70 degrees in February in North Carolina made Lake Norman Cottage a total treat. We were hoping to get some gelato on Saturday but found out that part of the cottage is closed until Spring- so the very nice lady made us a cheese plate. We sat outside in the sun and people watched- you can order wine, drinks, and I hear they occasionally have dinner? 

I'll definitely be back on another warm day!"}
{"text":"Th√®y are very professional and aesthetically pleasing! We celebrated our 6 year anniversary there and they made us feel at home!"}
{"text":"Want a dining experience and maybe make some new friends?  Lake Norman Wine Cottage a truly a fun experience! The wine tasting is awesome but my favorite part is making new friends as unless you go with a group you will be seated next to total strangers to enjoy the wine tasting and dinner that is also provided.  What fun!  I've really enjoyed each time I've visited and have made some key business acquaintances from most visits. Of course the view from their outdoor seating is second to none as it overlooks Lake Norman and a lovely marina at Davidson Landing.  So if you arrive early you can enjoy the view on a comfy Adirondack chair while waiting for the event to begin. The meal that is served with the wine tasting is just enough to cleans your palette between wines and is a tasty treat.  They are also very generous with the wine samples.  Last year I gave my special friends gift certificates to enjoy the experience and advised them that I'd love to go with them but they might really enjoy meeting new people and making new friends if they book the evening by themselves. Be ready for a truly a fun evening!  Hint: MAKE RESERVATIONS because they frequently book up!"}
{"text":"A group of girlfriends and I did the Friday/Saturday Night Wine Tasting and Tapas to mix up our monthly girls night out. It was really fun and a great way to taste some wines, with generous pours! The evening featured 5 wines paired with an appetizer, entree, and dessert.

If you have strict diet restrictions, as some of us in our party did, I recommend e-mailing or calling Lake Norman Cottage at least a week in advance to let them know. One member of our party did, and although she made her nut allergy clear with the attendant the week prior and again at the hostess stand as we were seated, she still wasn't able to eat the appetizer prepared, (a little bit of a bummer when you're trying to be cautious!). The service took a little longer than a normal dinner would, but because it was a tasting we were happy to sit and linger for hours, (we were probably there a total of 3). 

Great unique experience, perfect for a Girls Night!"}
{"text":"Cozy cottage with a nice selection of wines from all over. There's also a gift shop, some wine related, some not. They also have some local beers available. There is a boat dock if you want to stop in for a bottle or two while cruising the lake."}
{"text":"Great place to have a glass of wine. Love the location.  I wish it stayed open later, close around 9."}
{"text":"Best kept secret at the lake. You have to try this place. Now they have the cabin and the cottage. The cabin is a piano pub."}
{"text":"This was our date night.  We made reservations for 6 o'clock because we have a special-needs pet.  Our beloved schnauzer, 12-1/2 years old, is a diabetic.  She MUST eat at the same time morning and night so that she can get the proper amount of insulin at the right time.  Our 6 o'clock reservations were made with this in mind, which we thought would allow plenty of time for us to drive the five minutes home and feed her by 8 o'clock.  We didn't make it.  After sitting at the table for one hour with nothing more than a small glass of wine and a couple of pretzels, we inquired where our food was.  We were told it would be out shortly.  It wasn't.  We then told our waiter that our dog at home was depending on us to feed her and give her insulin and we would have to leave no later than 7:45.  He was very apologetic about the delay and our service and said our food would be right out.  It wasn't.  Our appetizer was served at 7:15.  Our dinner was served at 7:45, at which time we requested our dessert to be packaged to go and that we would have to leave ASAP.  We never saw dessert.  The food itself was good, as were the wines.  The appetizer was very good but the chicken with pasta was meager.  At $25 per person plus tip, we expected more.  At no time did anyone offer an explanation as to the delay.  When we inquired about the delay, we were told there was a problem in the kitchen.  We realized those things happen, but now we are torn between giving them another chance to do it right and never going back."}
{"text":"I think this quaint place is the best spot in the area to have a lakeside drink, and I've been to them all. Atmosphere is so homey and warm. The wine selection is quite extensive and the staff is knowledgeable. Perfect for girls night or date night. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little boutique with an included wine shop that also has an occasional dinner menu.  Friendly service, great view on the water, and a very good selection of wines.  A beautiful location for a relaxed cocktail."}
{"text":"Never felt so awkward...not even sure if anyone was actually working because the only contact we got was a mumbled greeting from a group of people too involved in their lazy wine tasting to do anything but watch me.  I was hoping to buy a bottle before leaving town and my mom wanted gelato but the blank stares and lack of any sort of service or respect obviously deterred us."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a snack on my way home from a vacation driving back from Charlotte airport"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great surprise after exiting I-77 for lunch and a glass of wine and found this wonderful spot! Can't wait to come back! Service was very friendly and informative about wine!"}
{"text":"I visited LNC for a wine tasting sponsored by Jazz Diva Events.  What a pleasant surprise!  The place has a whimsical feel with a wide assortment of wine accessories for sale that provide decoration until sold.  The evening was lovely, as was the view of the lake.  LNC was reserved for our event which made it more intimate as people were not coming and going.  There are five rooms available for seating with tables/chairs, sofas, and comfortable sitting chairs.  The tasting included five wines (two white, three red) with a 2.5 oz pour (about 2 glasses total) with a tapas and small plates (appetizer, entree, and dessert).  If you really didn't like white or red, you could stay with the color of your preference. The music system was set to an appropriate level so that conversations could be held at a normal tone. Although there was a musician present to play for the event, I was not able to hear him as he was set up in the front room.

I am giving the Cottage five stars because the ambience, service, wine, and food was delightful and price was affordable, even on the lake!  The servers were pleasant and knowledgeable about the wines being served.  In addition, their merchandise prices are comparable.  LNC is a great place to host a girls get together or a small gathering for friends.  I am already looking forward to my next visit to LNC."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my first time the other night and I know I'll be back. My husband and I had some free time and thought a glass of wine by the lake would be nice. Time to check out the Cottage...!

If you like wine, you'll be like a kid in a candy shop when you walk in. Wine, wine everywhere!  There were some people there, already enjoying their wine and the employee stepped up and asked us what we were looking for. It was a hot night so we opted for a white. She knew her wines and eventually recommended an awesome Pinot Grigio (I usually avoid them - turns out I was drinking the wrong ones!). 

She poured our wine and we went outside to enjoy the evening. She quickly brought out some pretzels to munch on and checked on us a couple times. Great service!

After we finished the glass, she bagged the remainder of our bottle and home we went. Great place and we'll be back!!  Next time, with friends!"}
