{"text":"I'm staying at the hotel so I thought I'd give it a try. Hip atmosphere overall. I had a nice lunch with a view of downtown. I had the chop salad made with locally grown greens, pepitas, cotija cheese and grilled chicken. Good size portion enough for two. It was tasty and fresh. I also have the deviled eggs which were beautifully presented. Not really the traditional flavor but still pretty good. I'm curious to try their dinner now."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour, very well crafted drinks, love the old fashion and Juan is my favorite bar tender!! pork belly sliders are delish as are the shishito peppers. :) great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Blue Hound a couple of nights ago for the first time with friends.  The hotel and restaurant had a cool and hip atmosphere.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time and the place was not crowded.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable and recommended several things on the menu including the special which was soft shell crab over an artichoke coulis with fiddlehead fern.  I ordered the special (and a shot of gazpacho) and the others at the table ordered a flatbread pizza and tater tots (yum!), the salmon, and the chicken.  When the salmon came out, it was such a tiny portion and my friend commented on it.  I had an option of ordering one or two crabs with my dinner and I opted for one after asking our server if it would be plenty of food.  I should have ordered two.  The food at Blue Hound is creative, ubber fresh, and delicious.  However, we all left still feeling hungry due to the small portion sizes.  We talked about ordering more food but the items are quite pricey and our bill was already over $100 without tip (only two of us had an alcoholic drink).  We eat out frequently at all of the new hip and trendy places that are opening all over Phoenix and feel that with all the other restaurants who are now offering creative farm to table food at  lower prices and larger (yet reasonably sized) portions, Blue Hound has some adjusting to do.  It would be a tough sell to get me to go back unless I knew our bellies would be full and our bill not so high."}
{"text":"Wow, I am impressed.  The bartenders are always amazing.  The manager was very flexible and accomidating for my larger group of friends. Their happy hour blows my hair back every time and the twist on a traditional old fashion was superb. :)"}
{"text":"By far the BEST pineapple upside down cake I have EVER had. The ambiance of this restaurant is extremely modern and sleek. Overall I really enjoyed my experience at Blue Hound and will definitely be back soon to try more food!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when they built The Hotel Palomar at City Scape. I love the sustainable concept and reused materials and art that make it so unique.  The blue hound kitchen is a very hipster and very kool. Joe and I went there on our date night a few weeks back. I don't know the bartenders name but his handle bar mustache was fantastic I loved his style. This guy was absolutely talented. He wasn't your run of the mill cheesy bartender you normally run into out here. The drinks were awesome and unique... Joe ordered an oaxacan punch he loved it. next time we go we are trying the smith and wesson."}
{"text":"OMG my friend albert loves this place. He says its the bomb diggity fo shizzle. If you go to downtown phoenix and can only do one thing you better go to the blue hound. Peace out yo!!!

Btw! Theres a pool that they people jump into every monday night. Geronimo!!"}
{"text":"Holiday gathering with family and friends.  We hit Blue Hound before we went to Lucky Strike - great combination. Drinks at BH was second to none (lemonade and Jack, ahhhh).  We sat at the bar first: bartenders were helpful and went out of their way to create the drink we wanted. Fantastic.  We sat inside (must say the patio looked off the hook) and enjoyed ordering 7-8 appetizers to share among all.  I think the appetizers are comparable to the entrees as far as variety.  Not sure the waiter was too happy about a table ordering just appetizers - but oh well, we are the patrons, right ??  Definitely be back.  

One more thing that was great - they validated parking in the underground garage.  Yes!!  No nickel and dimming here...."}
{"text":"Really liking the vibe here.  I like how the bar and lobby start to blend with a full house.  It is definitely a cocktail joint and the beer on tap continues to grow.  Have been about twice a week since they opened.

The food offers a wide variety to choose from and I like that many of the apps and entrees are created for a sharing environment. I've worked my way thru the menu pretty quickly.  Here's some suggestions:

*Starters*
Tater Tots
Deviled Eggs
Warm Mixed Nuts
Citrus Olives

Roasted Beets
Heirloom Tomato Salad (Tasty, but 3 slices was not worth the price)

*Main Dishes*
Mac N Chees
Short Ribs 
   (The gravy boat dish is cool, but the rib needs to be cut into smaller pieces)

*Dessert*
Cheese Cake with Tortilla Ice Cream
   I'm not the biggest fan of dairy, but Tortilla Ice Cream is great!

All in all, I'm happy with the cocktails and apps at any hour.  You do pay for the upscale environment to be downtown, but I feel it's worth the experience.  The elevated view out of the windows is a spectacular over the city.

The biggest perk is you can head upstairs to Lustre's rooftop bar for a night cap.  You'll see a lot of the same staff working both bars.

I recommend for anyone especially the Scottsdale crowd before catching a game"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour.  Came in with some coworkers on Thursday and had a great time.  Rob makes the best Old Fashion I've ever had. Greg made one of my coworkers a Lawless and they loved it as well.  Definitely going to make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Great food, though a bit pricey.  I especially loved the pork belly kimchi sliders."}
{"text":"Went to Blue Hound for brunch today and I left  disappointed. I ordered the the brioche french toast ($12) and received one piece of toast that was marginal at best. If I am paying $12 for a piece of toast it better be exceptional, which was not at the case here. My husband ordered the spanish omelette which was decent, both portion size and taste wise, but the taste was still nothing great. His biggest complaint was that his coffee was not offered to be refilled one time. Service wasn't terrible but it was lacking, just as the food was. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! We stopped in about 1/2 hour before the kitchen was going to close.  The menu was really intriguing, and set up so that you can order and share small plates.  We enjoyed the Kale Caesar, Roasted Cauliflower, and a flat bread.  We also had a delicious Chocolate Creme Brulee for dessert.  The atmosphere is really appealing and our waiter was helpful and friendly. We'd definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"This is a really neat spot, despite it being in a hotel. The bar and restaurant area are upscale and the Manhattans will make you slap ya mama! We had the BLT with fried green tomatoes....the way to go...and their 4 cheese Flatbread (on special) was on point! Very crispy and thin...loved it. The martinis were a bit small, but packed a punch. Prohibition era drinks was a nice concept. 

This is a good place to go when there is an event. It won't be as crowded as the other places that are easier to find..."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp and grits, great beer selection,  nice ambiance for a small group. Lots of great new competition, but Blue Hound holds its own."}
{"text":"This is really hard for me to right because I love their cocktails so very much. They are unique and different (one of their drinks they came out with a glass of tobacco smoke to infuse with their whiskey cocktail). My only issue I had was that they only had one bartender working on a Saturday night, though he was excellent service was a bit slow for a Saturday night. All and all I will still come back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times (2 times for dinner, once for breakfast) and can't wait to go back.  The shishito peppers are fantastic, but so are the small farm cheeses, tater tots, and deviled eggs.  On a recommendation from our server the first time, I ordered the short ribs.  The meat just fell off the bone.  As much as I loved those, I tried the lamb meatballs the 2nd time there.  After the first bite, I was disappointed I didn't order the larger portion.  The service there was impressive and extremely helpful.  As a whisky drinker, my Brown Derby and Manhattan's were delightful."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable place--itis what we need.  I think the service was slow and they need to improve on that.   First we had the pate.  It was ok a little dry and plalin.   The bread that was served with it was too hard.
We had the trout-which was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of spice.  My partner had the rositto which was great.  He also had the ceviche.  The ceviche was way too bland like the pate.  Maybe they are being careful on the spices.  It has only been open a few days so they need a chance to work out the bugs.
If you like your food on the bland side you will enjoy the food."}
{"text":"We had friends come into town for a visit. We took them to Blue Hound for lunch. We had an amazing experience!  The food was great and fresh. My son had the BHKC BLT. It was amazing with green fried tomatoes.  I had the crab cake sandwich with a salad. The service was awesome also. They were friendly and fast with their services. We highly recommend the Blue Hound!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews- great drinks and super convenient to the Palomar hotel, but food was so-so. My bone in bass was marginal, but my husband's Kobe beef rib was spectacular! My daughter-in-law struggled through a bone in salmon steak that was not worth the trouble or the money. Dessert was amazing and we were delighted with the extensive after dinner drink options. We would try it again but I would steer clear of the fish next time the restaurant was basically empty but they were out of 2 of the main courses. Room for improvement but good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and some food and was instantly greeted by the friendly bar tender Bobby. I wasn't sure what cocktail I wanted but I knew I liked gin. He mixed me up a cocktail that not only looked great but tasted great as well! I came in a little before they opened and bobby made sure to make me feel comfortable at the bar while I waited for them to open. I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't like writing these type of reviews: If only a restaurant would live up to it's decor and menu-writing, Blue Hound would be a hit. Unfortunately, the food and the service didn't live up to the hype. But in response to all of the four and five-star reviews, there needs to be a dose of reality here, folks. Did we eat the same food?

Let's start with the good: the restaurant is dazzlingly hip, filled with beautiful people accented by only the most sophisticated lighting, and filled with the energetic buzz that set our expectations high. My first thought? \"This will be a home run!\"

I ate there with a group of foodie friends, all of whom were salivating with excitement to try what appeared to be a innovative and tasty menu. And it's received all this positive press; the media is always right...right?

For appetizers, we ordered the Endless Caramel Popcorn (poorly popped kernels seasoned with a non-nuanced avalanche of ancho chile. Where was the butterscotch flavor?) The Tater Tots were underwhelming, and the dip tasted like potato soup out of the can. The Hickman's Farm Deviled Eggs were the one shining moment of the entire meal, with an excellent balance of flavors and textures. 

I ordered Bob's Indian Red Peaches salad, for my entree, and was surprised with a very scantily-filled rectangular plate containing a small smattering of peaches, marcona almonds, a tidy--and tiny--pile of pepper cress greens and a few tiny lumps of fromage blanc. The peaches were delicious, but overall, it was all presentation and no substance. 

Also ordered was the Ancho Chile Braised Pork Neck which was a soupy concoction with ...er... no apparent sign of pork in it. For $17, Blue Hound, feel free to include a speck of meat. Just sayin.' 

When the 4\" wide crock of Mac n' Cheese was set down in front of us (mind you--this is considered an \"entree\") we almost had to giggle at it's diminutive size. Tell me, when one orders mac n' cheese, are they feeling like nibbling on a sample-size portion? I think not. Fail.

Hopes always remain high for dessert, so we ordered with gusto: A few cake n' shakes (the Nutella shake was dismal, and the chocolate cake bites tasted on par with Costco bakery goods), Lemon Blueberry Cheese Cakes (or should they be called tubes? The cheesecake was served in a bewildering tube shape, plopped unappetizingly on a bed of granola and blueberries. Not lovely, but odd.), and an order of the most dry, flavorless mound of Carmelized Pineapple Upside Down Cake ever put into my mouth. It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.

In summary, if you want to blow a few hundred bucks on a lackluster, mediocre and disappointing meal that pretends to be so much more, the Blue Hound is for you. It's a shame."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Brunch was unimpressive, lunch was solid, happy hour is  great and dinner was down right delicious. Also the cocktails are made with care, premium ingredients and creativity. I'd highly recommend the \"lawless\" whiskey and tobacco bitters and served in a glass full of vanilla tobacco smoke. I would also highly recommend the risotto croquettes, short ribs and deviled eggs. A few reviews claim this place is expensive, if your worried about that, trot on over to the tilted quilt next door or chipotle across the street."}
{"text":"I visited this place last week on my first visit to Arizona. By far the best mixed cocktails I have ever had.  I work at a hotel/restaurant in Bakersfield, CA which is the same style theme as this place. The female bartender was very friendly and helpful with my future wife and me. The short rib sliders were delicious, but the house mixed cocktails were out of this world good. When I come back to Arizona, I'm definitely going to stay at this hotel, because it is WELL worth the money. Thanks for all the hospitality great ambiance."}
{"text":"Another great Phoenix restaurant. I had dinner one night while attending a conference. I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was very tasty with a little kick, but not overly spicy. The English Mule is refreshing and a nice twist on the Moscow Mule. We ate outside on the patio and had a great experience. Dessert was the chocolate cake with in house banana ice cream and caramel. One of my colleagues had lunch there and said the bourbon/scotch menu and associated drinks are impressive."}
{"text":"Popped in for brunch after arriving in town for a conference. The salad was good, but not great. But you had me at \"bottomless mimosas.\" Staff were friendly and helpful, service was good, atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"My wife I came here for the first time today. The food is different which is what we like. Good food! Good bloody Mary's! Good Service!"}
{"text":"Great \"comfort food\". The pork shank is phenomenal (and huge!) and literally falls off the bone. The cheddar/bacon burger is perhaps the best burger I've had in the past year."}
{"text":"Awesome and unique in Phoenix for ambiance alone.  The service was on point and perfectly staffed.   Very friendly staff.  Excellent food"}
{"text":"What a great experience we had when we dined at the blue hound on May 5th, 2015. The food was beautifully presented yet still relaxed. The service by Jeremy was outstanding. He was clearly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food he was serving. 

Each dish was delicious and interesting. The shrimp with creamy grits sets the standard for this somewhat trendy dish. I will have a hard time ordering it any where else now! The beet salad with dates was beautiful and we'll composed in nice bite size pieces that made it easy to get all the flavors in one bite, a detail often overlooked when form takes precedence over flavor. 

We will go back soon to try the many other dishes we wished we had room for!

Great job Blue Hound. A howling good eatery!"}
{"text":"I bring my wife here for cocktails on special occasions and it has been a great experience. On this visit I was told my wife's drink (dark and stormy) was served in a Collins glass due to the on going theft  of the copper mugs normally used to present the drink, and the ginger beer that they made in-house was very time intensive and that they now use a mix. Needless to say I will be looking for a establishment that cares about making a $10.00 cocktail that they can present with out excuses."}
{"text":"Great place. Warm atmosphere. Loved the tapas style plates. This place had my vote from the beginning, since they had Odell on tap. The bartender was impressive trying to offer his input on pairing a beer with our food options. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great...the food is not so great- a little bit too experimental and not quite getting it right. The tater tots are the only thing I'd order again. No to the flapjacks, the cornbread salad combo, and the red snapper. Maybe next time, l'll just come for cocktails like others recommended..."}
{"text":"Luster is on the 3rd floor. Not sure why I couldn't find it on Yelp but its a cool spot. Pool is within arm's reach and the roof top bar offers small bites and drinks.  I had the luster burger which was grass fed and my wife had the turkey flat bread. The burger was excellent... a little over cooked although. Flat bread was nothing special but the ambience was great and I would go back especially during the spring and earlier in the day... brunch and mimosas would be amazing on a warm sunny day. My only other critique is to wipe down the table... The stains were noticeable and that is not representative of a Kimpton property. Happy dining! James"}
{"text":"I admit, I have been a bad Yelp citizen, always using, never contributing ratings.  But the last two nights at The Blue Hound have forced my hand.  For our weekend getaway at the Palomar, we decided to try the hotel restaurant the first night. We went all in, having the \"Chef and Bar Squad Geek Out\" tasting menu.  Wow.

We had terrific service from our server (forgot his name), and personal visits from Adrienne (or Cheyenne?), the GM.  The chef even tailored our selections for my wife's selective palate (no seafood, nothing raw).  Then he personally delivered and described each amazing course.  And the pairings from the bar were perfect.  Our favorite was the spiced up version of a Singapore Sling.  A great evening.

The next night, we had reservations at a neighboring restaurant, The Arrogant Butcher, mainly because of their prime rib special.  We were joined by my dad, and seated just before 7.  After we ordered an appetizer, we were informed that they were out of prime rib.  It was a game day, but one would think with the evening booked through 9 PM with reservations, they would still have had their special at 7 PM.

We left, quite disappointed, with our evening plans a mess.  Then, in a stroke of genius, my wife suggested a return to The Blue Hound.

As soon as we met our server, Zach, we knew the evening would be turning around.  My wife and dad decided to split \"One Big A$$ Steak\", a 36 oz porterhouse, with cast iron scalloped potatoes.  I asked for a half order of the pork belly sliders.

The chef, upon hearing of our disappointing evening, didn't want us to wait for food.  So he sent out a complimentary tater tots appetizer (amazing) followed by an interesting roasted corn on the cob (also delicious).  My wife and father asked for repeats of the spiced up Singapore Sling. I had a Hendrick's gimlet, which the bartender perfected with muddled cucumber (staying clear of lime at my request).

The night was already saved, and then the entrees arrived.  My steak loving wife and my dad LOVED the porterhouse, grilled to perfection.  And just to go even one more step above and beyond, the chef sent me the full order of sliders, because he didn't want me to be jealous of the huge steak.  Over the top.

I have to go with five stars.  This was greatness in all aspects.  We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix for a conference in October, a group of us came here for dinner with reservations. We were accommodated with two rows of tables for about 20-30 people. The servers attended to us rather well. Great service so far.

When it came time to order, I asked for the Seafood Chowda. A few of my colleagues ordered the shortribs. When my food came, I was disappointed that the \"chowda\" barely had any broth in it. Probably two tablespoons worth. It had a good amount of mussels and a couple of clams. There were a few thin slices of tiny potatoes and that was it. Being a fan of hot and spicy foods I was expecting a little kick from the ghost chile. To my disappointment, all I tasted was salt. The food was very salty and not a trace of spice. I even asked the waiter when I ordered how spicy is it and was told that it had a good kick. I gave a mussel to someone to try and he agreed to the saltiness and no spice. When the server came around again, I asked if this is how it was supposed to be prepared and he said yes. I pointed out the lack of any broth, creamy or otherwise and he just shrugged his shoulders. 

Other people in my party were disappointed as well. The short ribs did not even have a hint of blue cheese. And this was coming from a person who loves cheese and is also a chef.

Sadly, many of us walked out at the end of our dinner very disappointed. We found this place to be over-priced and over-hyped. We concluded that there was little effort to please us due to the large size of the group which guaranteed their gratuity. 

It's sad that the only thing some of us enjoyed was the popcorn. My advice: review the menu carefully and ask a lot of questions. I most likely will not come back here the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Sea Bass was exquisite!  Perfect combination of flavors. By far was the wonderful service from James!!"}
{"text":"The dining space is very well done and true to what one expects in a Kimpton property.  The cocktail menu is diverse and rather notable in its imaginative mixtures.  The wait staff was attentive and informative.  The menu has a wide variety.  And the food is delicious!  The downside to all of this is the cost.  I have never paid so much for so little.  The quality of the fare does not outweigh the sticker shock here.  The best I can do is give this a 3-star rating because of the pricing. 5 teeny-tiny tacos for $15?  And I do mean teeny-tiny.   The KFQuail is fantastic but you 3X more cornbread than quail.  And the gravy is outstanding.  But there is so little of it there (the quail, that is).  And at $17 no less.  Roasted beet salad and a roasted peach salad for $12 each?  There is barely a half-serving in each.  Don't go by their online menu either because it is out of date in regards to what is offered and what is being charged.  Nearly every item is at least $2 more than shown online.  The best value on the menu are the baby zucchini corn dogs.  

5 small dishes, 2 drinks and tip left us $100 poorer.  Great food, lousy value."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a birthday dinner. Carolina was an amazing server and was very knowledgeable, really awesome experience"}
{"text":"First meal here and loved it. Started off with the tater tots with pork, the zucchini corn dogs and the sopes. All vey good. Sopes my fav by far. For dinner the trout and Kentucky fried  quail. Again both very good. Also had the Tommy's Margarita - good.  Asked our server Blake for a recommendation for a second drink, he asked what i liked and he said he had the perfect drink. Came back w/ pineapple, beer, tequila combo, WOW, very good!   Nice location, downtown has another great place to come to."}
{"text":"A Foodie Delight

This is my third time at Blue Hound and haven't been dissapointed yet. Being across from US Airways Center and the ballpark make this one of the top choices before an event. The Pork Belly sliders are my go to for every trip.  It is a great place to taste a few different things when you are with a group.  Our server this time was Caleb and helped us narrow down our selections.  And though Sangria is not on their menu (it should be) they whipped a very tasty one up for me.  The only negative thing I could come up with is the noise level.  It is a fun place to be but the acoustics can make it a little hard to hear."}
{"text":"Evening stated off horrible. Had reservations, didn't get seated and dealt with a rude bartender and beyond rude customers while we waited. Spoke to the manager, he got us seated immediately and from that point on, our service was impeccable. Our server, the manager, and the food were fabulous. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite watering hole downtown. The cocktails are delicious and the staff are attentive. Only wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a neat place downtown for a friends 30th birthday. I used Yelp's \"New and Hot\" search in the area and found Blue Hound Kitchen. I liked the menu and location so decided to try as the ratings were good. I was beyond impressed. I have eaten all over the world and in extremely nice restaurants but Blue Hound Kitchen's service was out-of-this-world. I had booked the reservations for 5 through opentable and made a little note about the birthday. They called to confirm and when I spoke about the birthday and dessert possibilities she was very accomodating. I had mentioned also my friend was gluten and dairy free. Upon arriving the staff had not only pulled a menu and highlighted the items upon it that were gluten and dairy free for her but then also had placed a birthday card signed by the entire staff on top! They referred to her by name and really made the whole dinner seem so special! It was almost like dining with family! I was so impressed with this service and cannot even begin to thank them enough for making it such a special evening! If you have special occassions this is the place to celebrate it. The food was fun and tasty (I'm sure most of the other reviews below go into detail on that). It's right across the street from Stand Up Live also so being able to make it a full evening out is also handy. I will definitely be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"After you've fought your way here through the labyrinth beyond the goblin city, found an underground parking space, avoided the pitfalls of construction and ventured to the second floor entrance... be sure to present your ticket for validation at the desk!

We had a birthday (not mine) outing here, and I have many good things to say! Strong cocktails! Intriguing flavors! Moody and inviting setting! Our waiter did forget to grab drink orders from the last 2 (of 9) people at our table - one of us had a half drink so maybe he was misled. He made up for the lapse with anecdotes and consistently attentive service thereafter. 

We were in a corner, which we filled with laughter, and it was loud but not so loud that (being in the middle) I couldn't turn and hear what the other end of the table was chatting about.

There was something for everyone on the menu, even shortribs served on the bone, in a bowl, over tasty sides (for the Viking/Caveman in you). I had the risotto - full of flavor - and the olives and bottomless popcorn were big hits... but the tacos, the tacos! It was the only sign of sadness from our group, that the full order of tacos wasn't really a meal, but more of a tapas plate.

Oh, and water carafes should probably just have been left at the table. It's shwank to fill a glass halfway from a glass bottle, but for those of us who work in the Arizona heat and rely on rehydrating in the evening... waiting for water to arrive (again) is anything but neat-o.

BUT! before you're done, save room for a digestif up at the rooftop bar. It's lovely, too."}
{"text":"Kinda dead on a Friday. More people should come down its got a nice atmosphere. Good beers good spirits semi good company."}
{"text":"My friends and I had just left a concert Saturday night when we decided to go out for drinks. Since we are from tucson we were not familiar with the area. We decided upon this restaurant based on the good reviews. Many times I hate asking bartenders for a drink recommendation because they more worried on how fast they can make the drinks. While we where there we were recommended the metropolitan by Michael, which was delicious! I would recommend this drink. Through out the night we also had another bartender Rob that was also very attentive. If you want a place to relax and enjoy yourself I would suggest going on a night when Michael and/Rob are working! Had a blast!"}
{"text":"Alright, you're ballsy enough Blue Hound. The food had gotten a lot better here. The menu always looked good before but didn't seem to deliver. It's not bad, little pricey compared to some meals for the same price. The booths are incredibly comfortable and I don't mind paying $10 for strong cocktails. I'm cool with it."}
{"text":"Unable to review this place nor do I think I want to. Left 2 messages, sent an email for a large party reservation. No one has called or emailed back. Customer service is always one of my top 3 when reviewing or recommending. So far, F."}
{"text":"A friend and I and our daughters were attending an event downtown and decided to try this. Brunch was all they were serving so my friend and I ordered the Spanish omelette. We split it because we were told the portions were big. They are plenty big, but we didn't even finish it because it lacked  flavor. Neither one of us cared for it. The kids wanted corn dogs and when they were eating them we discovered that they were not fully cooked. The batter was raw all around the corn dogs. My friend and I also ordered bloody Mary's. I had 3 small sips and could not even choke any more down. It only came garnished with a lime wedge, and the flavor made me feel a little nauseous. My friend thinks there was a lot of garlic in it.......we did complain about the corn dogs and they apologized and took it off our bill and offered us free desert. We did not take them up on it, we just decided we would call it quits. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic evening here! After making a reservation originally for 8, we showed up a few minutes late and only had 7 but they were completely accommodating and understanding. 

I had the Brusselsprout hash and added goat cheese (again, no complications) and it was so delicious! They refilled our drinks regularly and the staff were all polite and relaxed. 

One of my friends flatbreads came out 5 minutes later than the rest of the food, which wasn't a huge deal for us, but the manager came and apologized personally and not only comped her food but gave us a free Pineapple Upside Down Cake for the table to share! 

This was easily one of the best experiences I've had here and will always be a loyal customer! Between the interesting and tasty food, the downtown location, and the awesome decor and atmosphere, it is a definite Must every time I come home."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends for a Sunday breakfast a few weekends ago and it was a pleasant experience. We had to wait a bit for everyone to show up and there was ample, comfortable seating especially as this is connected to the hotel right next to it. The decor is very trendy and modern with a mish-mash of great furniture the comes of looking lovely. 

The selection for breakfast was a nice variation and everyone seemed to enjoy what they got. It is a bit pricey here, for example a small glass of apple juice was abut $4 but personally that's why I just stick to water wherever I go. Our waitress did seem a bit scatter-brained but the service was good. I don't normally get a chance to try out places in downtown Phoenix so I'm glad our friends suggested this place. If I had a chance to go here again I wouldn't hesitate."}
{"text":"Had the quinoa salad for lunch recently during a work trip. Such great flavor and great atmosphere. It was a little pricey but a delicious salad."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was excellent, the food was an unpleasant experience on the pallet; there were too many complex elements in the food and could not finish any of the dishes I ordered.
Maybe try it again when the menu changes"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance. Good appetizers. Don't order the short rib unless a) you like every bite to be either fatty or dry/charred, and b) you like your grits lukewarm and creamy."}
{"text":"I was happy that this place was at the Kimpton Palomar hotel in Phoenix. The review is mainly on the drinks since, I only had an appetizer. That appetizer was the mac n cheese and it was scrumptious! Extra cheesey with a mixture of white cheeses, served in a petite cast iron skillet to keep it warm. 

I tried three of the drinks on tbe menu, must try the hibiscus vodka drink ladies refreshing for sure! Meet Me in Rio was good as well if you like coconut milk nice and fruity. I also had a grapefruit rum drink that had a tangy zing. This place is a must if ever in DT Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal &the staff is awesome. Downtown Phoenix has few options anyway, so it's imperative to find a great place to eat. BLUE HOUND isn't the cat's meow. It's the Blue Hound's bark! (even better, que no?)"}
{"text":"Preface: I'd give this place 2.5 stars if that was an option. 

I met the girls for happy hour. I didn't feel like a fussy house cocktail so I ordered my standard gin & soda. Too bad they had no specials for this very basic drink ($8, I think for a single). So I ended up paying a lot more than others with their whiskey lemonades or whatever-the-heck they ordered. 

After seeing the array of HH dishes ordered by others, I settled on the Kennebac Potato Fries and Hickman Farms Deviled Eggs. Both were tasty, indulgent snacks. I loved the rosemary on the fries and the generousness of the yolk mixture in the eggs (fork and knife were essential for me and my clumsiness). 

The sliders got good reviews as well, though I didn't try them. 

Decor was enjoyable. Service could have been better, but we were sitting in the lounge area so maybe they weren't as focused on us (however, it is happy hour in a hotel...I'd think they'd be paying attention, especially during this peak time).

All and all--an okay experience, but I know I am not going out of my way to return--especially as a local. The happy hour just isn't that great of a deal (and I wish they had more food options! Not a great selection and the dinner entrees are $20+). The inconvenience of parking downtown and so-so service just adds to my Blue Hound apathy. I guess if you are downtown it's a fine option."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I decided to have dinner at Blue Hound Sunday night. We figured it would be steady but slow enough to enjoy dinner.

The decor itself is amazing! Very well decorated and unique, from the lighting fixtures to the coffee tables.

The food of course, was the best part of the night. Sergio was our server, and was able to help us by explaining the drink menu and the dinner menu. He made great suggestions for both, noting that for the dinner menu, it was more tapas and family style which works best for me. Sergio was also very attentive through out the night.

The Summer of Shandies cocktail was very yummy that I might just try to replicate it at home.
We tried a number of dinner items, all which were full of different but great flavors. My favorites though, were the tomato heirloom salad, zucchini corn dogs,and  the short rib.
For dessert, I would recommend the cake n shake. the cake part is definitely sharable but the shake, too good to share :)

Both managers that were on the floor, Cheyenne and Matt, even stopped by to check how our evening was going.

For the quality and the attention to detail that is spent to create the variety of cocktails and food, the value is definitely justified.

I cannot stress enough how wonderful the service was and how delicious the food tasted.
I will definitely be back for dinner and to try out Lustre the pool bar!"}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance of this place. Cozy, with a great view of downtown. 
I had the seared ahi and handmade pasta. The seared ahi was delicious! The outer crusted seasoning hits the palate last, and just adds a great flavor and touch of spice, and keeps you guessing as to what it is. The quinoa and red pepper pull all the flavors together perfectly. 
The handmade pasta fell just a bit short. The tomatoes weren't a good ripe flavor, and the pasta was a little to mushy for my taste. Overall, I'd recommend this place for an overall good dining experience."}
{"text":"Love this place, the service is excellent and the drinks are to die for. Robert is the best bartender of the bunch. He has great suggestions for drinks if you're not sure and makes a mean rum old fashion. 
I never miss a chance to come here when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"The perfect first date in downtown Phoenix.

Went here with two sorority sisters after seeing The Nutcracker at Symphony Hall. It was a late dinner for a Sunday night. I ordered Tommy's Margarita and they each got a glass of red wine and sparkling champayne. The entrance to this place (located in/near City Scape) is so stunning. The waiting area has these lush, new age couches and exterior decor on the walls as wall art. It's very cool to see. We were escorted to the back dining room near the patio (which overlooks city scape and all of downtown PHX, yeah it is as amazing as you're thinking) past the bar area and group seating tables. 

I ordered the endless caramel popcorn for the table and it was such a surprise! Infused with a chile pepper, this was not your mama's caramel popcorn for sure. My sisters ordered the mushroom soup and a kale leaf caesar salad. Both had very high remarks.

For dinner we orded the New England scallops, another kale salad and duck flatbread. I can't speak for them but everything was fantastic! The scallops were so soft and had a plate of seasoned tomatoes and gac under. That made the flavor explode in your mouth.

I would totally go back here for pre-show drinks and apps. Or even on a date. It's so great."}
{"text":"Good food and tasty unique cocktails but VERY slow service even for drinks."}
{"text":"I had a friend who stayed at the Kimpton hotel that the Blue Hound is in (I hadn't heard about it prior to this weekend) and she had a dining credit at the restaurant, so we decided to check it out.  

The bad:  Our server was initially very distant and not particularly friendly. However, after looking him in the eye, saying lots of \"pleases\" and \"thank yous\" and just generally engaging him, he was so much friendlier.  The only other negative is that he seemed to get lost and didn't check back with the table often.  We would've ordered another round of drinks had he come back more often. Getting the check with difficult as well.  The I also had a friend that ordered the flatbread (not sure if it was pumpkin or sweet potato, but it was along those lines) with sage...it was a good concept, but not savory enough.

Now the good:  The server lightened up and was very sweet once he got over his initial standoffishness.  The drinks were pretty decent.  I was looking for a Moscow Mule, but the server informed me that they don't have ginger beer, but ginger simple syrup.  So we kind of improvised and it was still good.  Everyone ordered a drink off of their specialty menu and enjoyed it.  Food wise -the bottomless popcorn - YUMMY!!  And they were generous with it.  As I mentioned above, my friend ordered the flatbread - consensus at the table was that it was too sweet and not savory enough.  I ordered the trout - DELISH!!! We shared a couple of the chicory salads - pretty good...the dressing was nice and light.  Others at the table ordered the mussels and the flatbread of the night and they were all very happy.

Overall, I'd give the place another whirl...particularly for drinks!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to this restaurant last night for her graduation along with my dad her brother, her mom and her mom's boyfriend.  I think I ruined all of them to going out to eat at other Kitchens forever.  We started with tater tots, charred pork belly sliders and the family farmed cheese plate.  I don't think anything says family dinner like reaching over each other for another delicious bite because everything is addictively good.  Up next we had the cured strawberry & fennel flat bread, crispy salt and pepper shrimp,  BBQ short ribs an added bonus was something Chef Brent whipped up was snapper on french role with a sweet jelly and citrus aioli.   I would have never thought white fish and jelly would go together but I was so very wrong.  For desert with had their pineapple upside down cake with date ice cream, chocolate Crème Brûlée, and finally the strawberry shortcake served in a jar.  This is my first review I have ever felt the need to write and I think that I need to work on my description because I certainly cannot describe the amazing flavors appropriately with words.  What I can do is encourage you to find out for yourself and enjoy every minute of it."}
{"text":"We ordered a quesadilla, burger, desert gin fizzy and a buffalo trace cocktail for room service. Burger was only available cooked well. Two patties, nice char but one patty cooked to order would have been juicier. There was too much stuff to actually masticate the thing without jaw fatigue setting in. But super tasty. I took it apart and had enough stuff for two respectable burgers. 

Quesadilla  was made with chèvre. Again, tasty, but lack of gluey cheese left the thing falling apart and mushy. Nicely seasoned though. Very mild almost undetectable flavor in the salsa. The gin drink tasted like creosote, the rain-triggered aroma that AZ natives know and love. I found this interesting but not sure I want to drink my creosote? Not decided yet, but it is a cool idea. I was impressed with the value here -- nothing totally bizarre like you can get with hotel restaurants and not overpriced. Pretty good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks!  Manager Zach Harte helped make it a great experience for us as 3 sisters waited for Springsteen!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my boyfriend's birthday Here and the drinks were amazing!  I highly recommend the shrimp and grits...also if you want to make the most of the experience, ask for james!"}
{"text":"The bottom line with discretionary spending, which eating out represents, is value. We don't indulge in this luxury a lot. So each experience matters. The Blue Hound offers real value. We enthusiastically recommend Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails. Here's why.

My wife and I recently took our dear friends and neighbors to the Blue Hound to celebrate a birthday. They had never been there. We will all be back (no surprise to us). A thank you call the next morning said: \"Dave had a grand time last night!\" That was the point.

As always, the food was outstanding in all respects: presentation, taste, value, and service. To the latter point, our server was Ryan. He does a superb job of making his guests welcome, with just the right balance of politeness, knowledge, attention without being overbearing, and sensitivity to the mood of the experience. He clearly knows and respects the quality offered from the kitchen and the bar and that made us comfortable with each of us customizing our orders. Yes, we all had different entrees and they were outstanding.

A real experience for the guys was the amazing Lawless cocktail. Ryan put us on to it and we just had to try it. Astounding! Just that would be worth a visit to the Blue Hound. 

We went early on a Sunday evening--a good choice if you want a quieter, more low-key experience. Noise levels were non-existent and, of course, the staff's attention was more easily obtained. But we have been there during quite busy times and the quality of their offerings did not suffer in the least. Noise levels are up then, as they are in most restaurants at such times.

One of our friends is a design professional; his wife is a design genius. My wife and I are neither, but we have over 50 years of experience in creating a contemporary living environment. One of the things that made our friends' first experience here so special is the exceptional attention to design detail in the space; the use of wood, metal, glass and lighting all combine to indicate that someone really cared to make this space so inviting.

Parking is validated; a convenience. Total cost: $3!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and bottomless mimosas. Ordered \"eggs Benny\". Ended up with egg (singular) Benny with an eye dropper of hollandaise sauce and enough crab to cover the tip of my finger. Ambiance was good. Waited forever to get a pen to sign the bill. Finally had to get up and ask the hostess so that we could leave. The bar does look nice but I'm not sure why people are giving 5 stars. Maybe we struck out, maybe the drinks are amazing...I don't know."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get!  I ordered a flatbread pizza, $14.  Came with No Sides.  It might as well have been just bread.  There was really no sauce, topping or cheese on the thing.  For $14 + tax + slow service when it wasn't busy, I think I will spend my money elsewhere. This was my first visit to this restaurant and last."}
{"text":"This is the third time that we went to the restaurant and I have to say whoever hires people here now needs to get fired. HORRIBLE service. Hostess has no idea what she is doing and let's get real she's not performing brain surgery here. We decided to sit at the bar and only two seats were open, both of which the bartender was saving for his friends. What a mess."}
{"text":"Perfect addition to downtown... Best margaritas, flatbread was superb and the service as superior.   Leave it to Kimpton to do it up right; very nicely done and we will be back many times over!"}
{"text":"It's a great downtown staple. Food and drinks are consistently well done. Menus changes with enough frequency to keep it interesting. Atmosphere is nice.  Doesn't feel like a hotel resturant."}
{"text":"Well I have to give Blue Hound the fifth star for the service, atmosphere and of course the food.  We went with the chef's choice four course menu. Everything was perfect but I especially loved the double cut pork chop. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a few friends one night for after dinner drinks and some snacks. Bartender was wonderful and was able to get us everything that we needed even know it was very late in the hour. A lot of personalized attention, and seem to really value our patronage."}
{"text":"First night in Phoenix was spent at the Blue Hound. Great wine selection and cocktail menu: I tried a red from Oregon and hubby had a daiquiri. Food was great, for starters we got some amazing high-end tater tots, two words: harissa sauce. I had a flatbread with olives, grapes, peppers and feta for my main course (which I enjoyed so much that I tried to replicate it once I flew back home) and hubby had the pork belly, which came in a cast-iron dish. We were so full that we skipped dessert, but the menu looked promising.  Service was attentive and pleasant and I really enjoyed the modern, pub-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner meeting. Overall I was very impressed. The interior decor was modern classic flair with a rustic feel to it just to start. It has several options for space of you wanted to talk as a group privately or at an open table. 
We had several options that I posted pictures of but the stand outs were fried oysters and ahi tuna for staters. For entrees the Cajun style craw fish and rice the best dish around followed by the pork shank on a bed of risotto. 
We had the compliment of two bottles of wine that was stellar, Justin obviously a favorite from our central coast of CA followed by the Malbec which was the stellar on their selection as well. The best part of why this place deserves 5 stars is their service and price point . Most stellar entrees are in the low to mid 20s and top shelf wine in the 60s . Such great value even though we didn't pay for dinner . Top notch and my kind of place for a professional meal in a more laid back setting"}
{"text":"Great find! Must have the tater tots and try one of their unique cocktails recommended by James. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll be sure to go back!!"}
{"text":"I currently went there for Valentine's dinner with my husband. I enjoyed their 5 course meal except the fish I had was a bit over cook and no taste but other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Christmas day  Brunch  Disappointment:
I must admit I was looking forward to this as I am new to the area   I have been a chef with 3 degrees in Culinary Arts.  And over 35 years in the industry.  I called to inquire about the brunch the day before  I was told their would be a waffle station  along with many other items  the cost was at 37 dollars per person. $$$$$ I thought this to be reasonable  as it was Christmas morning. Our reservation was for 11:15 AM   we arrived on time. The  employees were pleasant.  The restaurant  was for the most part empty.  We walked over to the buffet  the items included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and fried potatoes, cold smoked salmon, bagels, Danish, and sliced assorted fruit,  a hot continental breakfast at best. Their was no waffle station  no omelette station as I was told there would be when I called the restaurant the day before. No lunch items at all   so I could not understand why they billed this as a brunch when it should have been billed as just a breakfast//  Needless to say that for over $120 dollars for a party of three,  we were quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Drinks: Good. I like the different flavors. It must have been a good bartender cause i felt it was worth my $9. I'd come here just to get a drink anytime.

Main Meal: Boyfriend and I got the steaks.  But we both really thought the steaks were just \"okay.\" Not too memorable. The heirloom tomato panzanella topping didn't seem balance out well with the steak flavors or something? Of course the balsamic worked though."}
{"text":"Decided to check out all the hype - not bad. First observation is that the hotel lobby (which is the way I opted to enter the restaurant - I did not notice the exterior door) is probably the most unimpressive that I have ever seen. You struggle for a moment to get your bearings - then you catch sight of the venue.

Place is sort of hip - but it fails in my mind to convey an ambiance where you would be inclined to spend 3 to 4 hours of your evening \"soaking\" it up. Has more of a \"grab a drink and find the next place\" feel. Once I got by that, I settled in and enjoyed the food.

Menu is limited and it tries a little too hard to be cool. Food we had was good but not memorable.

It is one of the many new eateries in the general Phoenix downtown area, specifically the City Scape area. It will likely fair well simply because of the proximity to the Kimpton Palomar Hotel - convenience will be its underpinning.

Will be back to give it another try. Maybe happy hour."}
{"text":"The Blue Hound... This has quickly become my go-to spot for cocktails and appetizers. Everything is meticulously on point and delivered with efficiency and grace. This would be an excellent start (or end) to any romantic evening. Just be sure to make reservations well in advance if you plan on sitting on the patio. It fills up fast. 

The Kimchi pork belly sliders are absolutely to die for and pair excellently with a smoky martini with a twist of lemon. 

Featuring fare for all manner of diets, be it vegan, paleo, gluten free and the like, this place is without a doubt a crowd-winning example of haute cuisine. We Phoenicians are proud."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie and a discerning customer. I enjoy many of the qualities of a restaurant that aims to be a finer-end establishment, such as this one, but I can equally enjoy a hole-in-the-wall if the food and service are good.  This restaurant had neither.

 - Incompetence -
I just had an evening here with a large group.  The management was very professional, as was our waiter in tending to our guest's needs.  Several things went wrong, however, and the food is just not good.  We ordered plates of the fries and aioli for the table.  One friend is severely lactose-intolerant, so we asked that fries be provided without the cheese.  Finally, 20+ minutes later his fries arrived, but still with cheese.  His entre later in the evening also had cheese he asked not to be included.

 - Overrated Drink Options -
It's true there is an encyclopedic drink menu, although most the options are overpriced for what you get.  When I was waiting for friends at the bar before our meal, the bartender was rude and stopped filling my order halfway through to talk to her coworker for several minutes.

- Horrible food -
Let me cut to the chase on this one.  I ordered the lamb meatballs. I got a full entre. They were inedible.  The lamb apparently died in a pepper mill explosion. I should have sent the dish back but we were already behind schedule on the rest of our evening, and I couldn't wait for them to correct the problem.  I can't think of the last time I ate something that was so horrible I couldn't bear to finish it. I like almost anything.

There were other problems with the food.  The greens in my salad had spoiled.  Many other guests did not enjoy there meals.  It's true that most of the entres are overpriced, so they offer \"medium\" sized or tapas options. This is just pretentious.  If your entre was decent enough to eat, customers won't mind paying more.  Several people ordered the salmon full entre and it was a thinly-sliced piece of barely cooked salmon on a plate.  The food all came in stupid iron pans that are too small to reach in and cut your meat with a knife.

- Checks -
For our dozens guests or so, our polite waiter was not polite enough to allow us to charge the bill to separate credit cards. I don't know how you're supposed to pay a $500 bill in cash among so many people. We should have brought a cpa to tabulate our invoice.  The waiter did include his 20% gratuity, thankfully.

In conclusion, skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"You know what I love? I love it when you decide to try a new, kinda pricey restaurant, and they just KNOCK IT outta the park! Blue Hound was such an exceptional experience on Wednesday evening, that I went back on Thursday. What else do you need to know, right?

With a funky but upscale relaxed atmosphere, the Blue Hound compliments the Kimpton Palomar hotel in which it resides. If you've stayed at a Kimpton, then you know that they have a great understanding of what's important, and what's not. Is the decor in this place a little jumbled? Absolutely. Are the servers simply first class? You betcha.

Oh yeah, the food...   ;)   The first funny thing you'll notice about the Blue Hound is the menu - the left page has a bunch of food dishes listed, but the right page... hmmm, this looks like ALL cocktails...!?!? Yep, the entire right page of this simple menu is cocktails -- and for good reason. The cocktails here are just epic! And the food -- while clearly playing a supporting role -- carries the experience superbly. The appetizers are unique, delish, and fun. The entrees are very hearty portions, and with exceptional presentation and flavor.

Particulars? Too many to cataloge, but now these. The pork chop entree is simply massive -- it's actually two pork chops. Totally wonderful, but consider sharing. Shrimp and grits was the bomb. Shishito peppers appetizer was novel and fun to all. Boudin balls were gobbled up before you could blink. Heck, you could just order 2 appetizers per diner and be more than satisfied.

And oh yeah.... someone in your party MUST order a \"Lawless.\" On my first visit, that someone was me, and I was thrilled with my choice. The Lawless is a rye cocktail that's embellished with -- ready for this? -- vanilla tobacco smoke. The cool part is not just how fun it is to watch them prep it, it's that the smoke MAKES the drink!

Blue Hound is a little pricey, but if you are in downtown and want a great meal, it's more than worth it. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will definitely plan to eat -- and drink! -- here again."}
{"text":"lovely lunch spot for a meeting right in the hotel.  loved my choice of the tacos but there are other just as good.  Atmosphere good and the wait staff is fabulous!  Don't ask for sweet tea, just saying if you are from Georgia."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into the Blue Hound, just to check out the place while we were visiting for a concert.  After glancing around we noticed a lively crowd at the bar and decided to dine there  

The bartender that greeted us was named Jesse.  He gave such great service during our time here we are excited to come back and visit soon  

We husband ordered a drink called the \"Charlton \"  which was a smoked glass filled with great enjoyment  while I ordered the English Mule.  We were both extremely happy with our selections. Looking to order a couple bites before the concert, Jesse mentioned the Boudin Balls, mac and cheese, and ribs .  

Chasing the last little bits with a delicious IPA, we were on our way to the show.  Happy to meet Jimmy and the rest of the bar, we are excited to come back during our next show. 

Thank you Blue Hound  we will see you soon !!!!"}
{"text":"Waw. That's all you can really say about the quality of food at blue hound. The restaurant certainly lives up to its name ... When you get your food you will feel blue... And it will look more for a hound than a human. My food had no flavor and literally came out hotter than the a Kim Kardashian Instagram selfie... She actually might have been the head chef because the meal totally lacked creativity and taste."}
{"text":"I really recommend this place if you love super uncomfortable bar stools, over priced drinks, and unimaginative bar food. Only gave two stars because the bartenders seemed pretty nice."}
{"text":"Excellent Bloody Mary's! Great service and a wonderful atmosphere. I will be back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful drinks. Excellent whiskey selection. Amazing bartenders.

I've only had food here once, but it was scrumptious. I'm a sucker for gourmet-ed up southernish cuisine."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and selection of southern favorites. I had the fried green tomatoes with lump crab and boulibon appetizers. Delicious."}
{"text":"Gastropub ?
Had dinner there was some friends after a day at the convention center. The space was very nice, the service very good. While my friends enjoyed some main entrées, after we ordered a few appetizers like Boudin balls and corn fries which were both very good, I ended up having for my meal just some sliders and small beat salad. Though the sliders were very small, I was amazed at how tough the meet was. The salad was very nicely done. All the meals well presented. I would go back.  As I look back at the menu, I am not sure I would call this a Gastropub. I will continue to look for funky food !"}
{"text":"Decided to make a reservation here before a concert in downtown.  I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the roasted chicken.   For an appetizer we went with the pork ribs.  The food was VERY good.  Not to pricey for the place but yes it's pretty poshy.  I would totally come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I visited the Blue Hound Kitchen during my late June visit to Phoenix.  Amazing FOOD and drinks.  The deviled farm eggs and the Prime flat iron are winners all day!  Look forward to trying other dishes when I find myself back in Arizona...    I was moved to write this review because when I reached out to the Blue Hound Kitchen to receive a copy of my receipt, the Kimpton ... Taylor Case, Restaurant Ambassador ... to be specific, not only responded to me in a timely manner, but also attached a copy of the receipt to the email.  Very much appreciated and matched what I have experienced at other Kimptons and my time dining at Blue Hound Kitchen.  So if you visit Phoenix, check both places out ... Blue Hound and the Kimpton!"}
{"text":"This place was fun and the food was good. We went buy late  with a huge group - there were 8 of us. Our server was pleasant and knew how to manage a big group well.  I wasn't very hungry so I just ordered an appetizer: fried tomatoes. They were very tasty and came with crab meat as a garnishment. My friend ordered the salmon. I didn't try it, but she said it was good."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying Blue Hound is a chic (my definition of an upscale but casual feel) restaurant. My friend and I went for the first time, and I appreciate how she searches for new places to check out and bookmarks them for us to try when I am in town.  Both her and I are foodies, so I was super excited to try a place that I had not been to before (as I usually stay in the Scottsdale area when visiting). Upon arrival I could immediately tell, the food was going to be good. The owner(s) had an upscale design for the restaurant which generally transitions to an upscale menu , cocktails and food.  I WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!!  Christopher was our server for the evening and he was extremely professional, knew the menu very well, attentive and genuine about ensuring we had a good evening. Now to the food . . .

We ordered the deviled eggs to start which has a little bacon jam surprise when you bite into it, so so so good. We also ordered the pork ribs which were very flavorful with a crisp on the pork that anyone who loves pork appreciates, you must have it! I ordered the shrimp and grits and my friend ordered the blackened salmon. Let's start with my friend . . . She takes a bite of the salmon and closes her eyes like she just took a bite of heaven. Initially I was thinking, dang . . . I should've gotten the salmon . . . BUT let me say that the presentation of my entree made my saliva glands water and I was ready to dig in. TOUCHDOWN!!! I loved the shrimp and grits, but because I had inhaled the deviled eggs and the pork ribs, ordering comfort food / aka heavier food meant I couldn't eat as much as I wanted, but I kept eating until my stomach turned the \"open my mouth\" button off!!! The drinks . . . My friend ordered a tobacco smoked cocktail with a fabulous table side presentation (frozen glass, tobacco, the works), I'm thinking . . . Not my cup of tea but . . . She tasted it and again her eyes closed but this time supporting a \"sip\" of heaven. She asked me to try it, and this is a very sexy drink that both men and women will love if you like bourbons, whiskeys, scotches etc. (I don't recall which one it was) no taste of tobacco at all!! I stuck to my usual, wine and they have a very nice variety.  This brings me to the end of a fabulous dinner, because we had negative room for dessert. 

If you haven't guessed already . . . I would highly recommend the Blue Hound for any and every occasion. Thank you Christopher and the Blue Hound team for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been her for dinner before the theater. The food was fabulous & service stellar."}
{"text":"Cool place! Had breakfast, cocktails and lunch. All great.! Certainly try this if you are in downtown Phoenix. Areal high spot."}
{"text":"Come here with friends or family in a big group, you can \"take on\" on the menu, as a the pleasant server put it, when you have plenty of people to share with.

For one thing, they have excellent short ribs here! I've longed for fall off the bone ribs since I first tasted them at some hole in the wall up in Michigan during my college days. The mac 'n' cheese was a get pairing, it came out hot & cheesy, cooked with shells so it had a stuffed taste to it. The deviled eggs were also one of my faves of the night.

The outdoor patio isn't large, but they have enough sitting to fit several tables and at least 2 large parties, we picked a perfect night to enjoy the weather, so I'd definitely recommend doing the same if you can.

I've heard they've got a great bar, which from the looks of passing it appears to be true. For an up and coming area, this restaurant fits in well."}
{"text":"Almost want to hold back a star because of how impossible it was to have a conversation at the bar but the food was so good that I'm giving it up! Plus they were so nice about getting us a table even though we didn't have reservations. We had just planned for the team to meet up for drinks for a super casual work meeting, but it was too loud. Hey, it's a busy bar, it happens.
 I just wish places like this would invest in the sound cancelling tech that I read about in Wired mag. Not dead quiet, just dialed down a bit. 
 OK, the food, amazing boudin balls, fried green maters and shrimp grits that rivaled the stuff I had on my last trip in the deep south.
  It really seems to me that regional food is being done better outside its home turf. I noticed that in the Bay Area as well. I visit NYC for work frequently but have yet to find a better pastrami sandwich there, than the one (maybe seven), I had in San Carlos. 
 Very good cocktail menu here also. Love the creativity and balance. I had to stop at three because I hate to fly with a hangover but next time, Ill try more on the list."}
{"text":"Blue Hound is an incredibly relaxing and classy place to go to happy hour downtown. The atmosphere is unbeatable and the bartenders are fun! Although their happy hour flatbreads are not big enough to get full on, they are delicious. I've tried all of them, and I like them all! I like their natural daiquiri, but my favorite drink was called, I think, 'Summer Breeze' off of the happy hour, but I'm not finding it on the online menu right now, so maybe it's seasonal. 

The next thing I want to try is the pool patio bar!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night with a friend for a quick drink and a bite to eat and was really happy we did! Great food and drink and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Trendy restaurant in downtown. It was nice to grab a bite to eat and a beer on the patio in the heart of Downtown PHX. A little pricey but they have a good happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start this review...every single item that I had was carefully crafted and delicious from my cocktail to my entree! 

I'd bookmarked Blue Hound on the recommendation of a colleague and jumped at the opportunity to take a friend there from out of town. The hostess who sat is was warm and friendly as she walked us to our table. We were about 15 minutes late for our reservation and had a good joke once we arrived. Once we were seated, per usual we are talking more than paying attention to the menu; however, Christopher was still very attentive and not overbearing. 

For a cocktail I had the Lawless and it did not disappoint!! The frozen glass over a tobacco skillet and the whiskey poured after was the perfect balance and was amazing. 

For appetizers, we ordered deviled eggs and pork ribs. The eggs had a sweet bacon pop in the middle that gave the last bite that WOW effect and the pork ribs were perfect. 

For my entree I ordered the blackened salmon and the fish along with its pairings just had all my senses in overdrive!!! 

I must admit navigating to the restaurant was a bit confusing at first but, I'd only knock off a .1 of a star! Now that I know exactly where it is, I should have no problems but my friend will say I'm logistically challenged no matter what!"}
{"text":"Holiday Rip-off at Blue Hound: most pathetic holiday buffet ever. My husband and I were looking for a Christmas Day restaurant option, as it was going to be just the two of us (why cook?) but it's also his birthday. Yup, Xmas baby. So when I saw that Blue Hound had a Christmas breakfast buffet, I was excited, as the place has been on my \"must try\" list since we moved to PHX a couple of years ago. What a disappointment. Bigly.

Now, $36 for a holiday buffet isn't bad at all, and as it was a breakfast/brunch offering, we didn't expect the moon. When we walked in and saw the meager layout, I wanted to leave, but my husband was hungry, and there are not many options on Christmas. I figured, the food will be really good, per their rep, so we'll stay.

The scrambled eggs were like a yellow sponge from sitting over the heat. No seasonings, no add-ins, just plain ol' eggs. Next up, the breakfast sausage links were cold and gray; they didn't even bother to grill them. Nuked or steamed, they were unappetizing to say the least. Now, the applewood bacon was quite good; I ended up chowing a lot of it because I was starving - hadn't eaten anything that morning - and everything else was so lame. The third treat was shriveled, plain potato wedges. Again, no discernible seasonings, and apparently no one in the kitchen could find any onions, bell peppers or mushrooms - anything - to jazz them up a bit. And barely lukewarm.

No waffles, no pancakes. Every crummy hotel chain has a Belgian waffle maker, but even that was too much to hope for here.

The tray of pastries looked pretty sad, but I was desperate. Yuck. The Danish were stone-cold, wet and heavy. The bear claws, dry and heavy. Supposedly there had been muffins at some point, the waitress said. The bagels were standard supermarket issue, i.e., basically donut-shaped bread. Oh joy, they had some smoked salmon. How festive.

The big finale were parfaits, about 1/3 cup each, with sour, out-of-season berries and a fruit tray dominated by melons and strawberries: they look great, but are tasteless this time of year. Finished up with watery coffee. 

At least our waitress was good. Still, I was even more irked to see that a 20% gratuity was tacked on the bill. For a party of two. Really?

Grand total for all this holiday cheer: $92.52. My husband didn't want to complain, so I let it go while we were there, but on Monday, I was still annoyed that they'd wrecked our holiday/birthday brunch. I left a message for the manager on the restaurant voicemail, and of course, silence.

No response IS a response. Like the buffet, it means \"fa la la la la you.\""}
{"text":"Always love coming here.  Good food,  great drinks,  great staff.   Love the central location,  especially when there are no events so the place is a little quieter.  Had a friend in from Chicago who loved the place.  It was the first stop on our circuit for the evening."}
{"text":"Great restaurant located in downtown Phoenix. Close walking distance to local sports and other great bars/restaurants. The Blue Hound has a nice, relaxing atmosphere and a menu that puts spins on some classic ingredients. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a different menu in the downtown area."}
{"text":"This was our fourth visit to the Blue Hound. The first visit was for dinner and all subsequent visits were for cocktails only. Dinner here is sub-par. The drinks, however, are excellent. Whatever your poison - beer, wine or mixed drinks - this place carries a nicely curated selection of all things alcohol. The barkeeps are knowledgeable - and can whip up a really good Old Fashioned or a Sidecar without any fuss. Highly recommended for drinks not dinner. The happy hour food menu is average."}
{"text":"Took one bite of the sliders and it tasted like I poured half the salt shaker down my. Luther. Additionally they were oily and dry. My boyfriend took a bite of them and immediately commented on the extent of how bad they were. The salad was also overly salty. The corn grits were not to my liking. Cool ambience but the food sucked and I wouldn't recommend it in a city with such great restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails!! Great staff!! Really cool atmosphere, that's not over done, will be back!!"}
{"text":"Reservations were made on-line, or so we thought. The reservation-maker (not me) booked the wrong weekend! We were a week early. Ooops. After being told there was like an hour wait, the manager stepped up and took great care of us. After a short wait we were seated in the outdoor patio area. 

The strange part was, while we were told it would be an hour wait, there were tons of empty tables, that remained empty the entire time. 

Upscale and young crowd - lots of black leggings. I felt kind of old and out of place. Service was attentive, but not overbearing. Food was excellent (I had the trout). Prices are not cheap. But under $200 for 3 with apps, cocktails, dessert. (I didn't pay).

They validate for 3 hours of parking in one of the Cityscape lots."}
{"text":"Ehhh...average at best and overpriced. We came around 630. Did not have a reservation so they said that the wait would be about 45 minutes. No problem! We planned to get a few drinks at the bar. There was no seating so we stood at this stand up area. No one bother to stop by and take our order, or even greet us. Our table was ready within about 20 minutes. After we were seated, our waiter took a good five minutes to stop by and introduce himself. The entire meal it seemed like we were a bothersome afterthought. Ordered the bacon oysters for an app. Yum!!!! I had the tagliatelle and my bf had the short ribs. Both were extremely under seasoned and my tagliatelle was super dry. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a few drinks and dinner before heading to a show or game in downtown Phoenix. It's attached to the dog-friendly Palomar hotel, so I believe you can bring your dog here, but I haven't tested it out yet. Their drinks are great and they use the huge cubes of ice in their whiskey. They also have a huge selection of whiskey, so you should definitely check it out. This place is like American tapas. So far, I've really enjoyed their cheese board, tots, and their flat breads are as good as any."}
{"text":"Two stars.  Because, I really have had better.  

A group of my foodie friends and I met up here in order to sort out the deets of our upcoming podcast.  The dude who made our reservation made it for four instead of five, so it took us a little while to get a table.  Not that big of a deal to me, especially since said dude bought a bottle of wine for the group to share.  

At long last we were taken to our table.  Our group nestled in to our cozy booth and perused the menu.  I already knew there wasn't much for me to eat there, as I had checked their menu online.  My cohorts ordered some appetizers: tater tots and deviled eggs.  Both dishes looked good, and everyone seemed pleased.

The service began to get a little shotty at this point. It took a while to get waters to the table and there weren't any napkins or silverware at the table until we asked for some (after the appetizers were delivered).  Two of my friends ordered appetizer salads/soups which didn't come until the entrees came.  Salad friend ordered with no walnuts, he is allergic, but it came full o' nuts. Soup friend was presented soup and no spoon.  Soup friend also ordered several items and was told that they were out (which I can understand, given that there was a Suns game that night), when plates were dropped at the table servers were VERY quick to disappear, leaving us to literally have to yell after them for the missing stuff/refills. 

As for my meal, I ordered the Citrus Marinated Olives and the Chicory Salad.  I let the server know of my vegan/gluten-freeness and he was helpful and accommodating.  The others seemed divided on their meals.  Lots of meat, that's all I can remember of what they had haha.  Eventually, the manager came to the table to apologize for all of the little mishaps and said a round of drinks was on the house. Fine by me, I thoroughly enjoyed my Tito's gimlet, thank you!  Then the executive Chef came out to apologize as well.  It was a nice touch.

All in all, I might give them a second try, but with all of the great places out there, Blue Hound might want to step up their game."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great changing drink and food menu.  Took my fiancé here for our first date and we regularly get take out.  Favorites are the short rib and steal for two.  The steak rivals all upscale steakhouses in the area."}
{"text":"I have a few friends that Rave about this place I've been wanting to try it for a while now find it in I was little skeptical at first cuz the hostess was not very friendly to say the least had a sour look on her face overall unfriendly never spoke to us one time as we are walking to the table the server was okay at best didn't really know much about the menu ask what would a duck wings I don't know their duck I figured that much out myself and you know I'm getting probably one of the best burgers I've had in a long time pretty decent size I would say 8 oz like the bun not too squishy not too firm lightly toasted and super juicy I would say I would rank in the top 10 had to Fry's with it was not impressed really soggy and too salty no bueno a funny thing the water was probably the best one I've ever had wish I had their filtering system on my house definitely go back to the Burger maybe next time I'll sit at the bar"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night, appetizers were excellent, including the deviled (sp) eggs with bacon jam and the pulled pork slider. I like the choice of small or larger portions. Pork shank was good but didn't blow me away, my colleague appeared to really like the shrimp and grits. The brussels sprouts on the salad menu were a great side and delicious. The chocolate pudding with marshmallow fluff was amazing. It had a graham cracker crust. The waitress was also excellent. Very happy, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good place been to Blue Hound a few times.  This Sunday went for Brunch. They were out of Short Rib Hash. Disappointing. I might call ahead next time. Party of 11 took up most of the customer service. I will visit again but I will make sure all of menu is available."}
{"text":"Burrata with honey, pistachios, raisins, Noble bread, and a fresh micro salad. This was especially delicious paired with an Aviation and Irish coffee cocktails. Blue Hound has some of the best cocktails around! I love the ambiance and the attention to detail the bartenders have for their elixirs."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Palomar off-season and spent most of my time here at the bar, sauntering in after one activity or another and only had apps to eat. Also knew one of the cocktail servers.  Fantastic cocktail bar with an antique concoctions menu and bartenders who know how to make old school drinks, bartenders were friendly and knew a lot about their trade, tools and drinks which was both educational and unusual.  Place is a bit pricey for what I think you get but it is a Kimpton hotel bar so.  As a hotel bar it did the trick, neither amazed nor dissapointed."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday. Couldn't have been better. 

Atmosphere: cool and smooth, industrial and warm wood. 

Friendly service: prompt and with a smile. I asked for the bartender to order me a drink based on my meal and preferences and his selection was perfect 

Food was great: rabbit pasta with aged Parmesan that was excellent. The oysters were like silk from the sea. 

Cocktails were stellar: bartender selected The Lawless for me, and I've never enjoyed one more. 

Bonus: an amazing birthday dessert and the staff signed a birthday card for me. 

I'm not from Arizona but on my next visit you'll find me sipping on The Lawless at the Blue Hound."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to have a cocktail before the Pink concert earlier this month.  Everything was packed and we stumbled upon this place.  The bartenders were friendly and attentive and my Manhattan was perfectly made.  We were in during happy hour and the price for our cocktails was very fair.  We even got to meet Pink's drummer at the bar!  If I ever find myself in downtown Phoenix, I wouldn't hesitate to stop in here again."}
{"text":"Service was good, ambiance is business casual, and the food was very good.  The burger was juicy and had great flavor.  We did not order any appetizers but they looked good so will have to go
back and try some more.

A bit pricey for lunch but we felt that it was justified.  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Selection was very good for two couples headed to a show. Hearty pork shank or light, tasty beet salad. Take your pick. The cocktails were not a typical selection. Fresh mint or rosemary adorn the glass rim. Nice draft beer selection. 
Must mention the excellent service. Our waitress was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. She was a trusted companion right through dessert!"}
{"text":"Been seeing a lot on line about this place & brunch. We were in the vicinity one night & ducked in for a snack & a cocktail. We weren't sorry. The bartender was knowledgeable about the full menu & of course cocktails. So after some brainpicking we went with 2 hand crafted delicious cocktails. Our snacks were some deviled eggs that I'd read were delish & they were. So we're 3 for 3. Good staff, app & drink. We will be back for brunch. The pancakes sound amazing. I mentioned to the bartender that wanted to try the popcorn & asked him if he liked it himself. Like how spicey is it etc. He said it's a perfect mix you really should try it on your next visit. Then brought us a sample. He was right it was good. That's the kind of exemplary service all bartenders need to exude. It's all about the customer."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place taking a road trip from New Mexico to California one Thanksgiving. I'm not sure if it was because it's down the street from the Phoenix Suns arena but, it was an amazing experience as we realized that they served upscale 'soul' food and it was actually one-of-a-kind. I would definitely recommend this spot especially if you are passing through. 

One thing that really stood out to me was the bartender, or should I say mixologist!? We could really tell the difference and the drinks were amazing! Along with the delicious food, it definitely did not hurt that we got great seats and an ice skating rink was developed outside the restaurant that day! 

We were really able to enjoy not only the food, drinks and ambience of the restaurant but also experience the vibe of the town and the local families. Definitely a treat!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here one evening while staying at the Palomar. I wasn't given the option for a table since I was dining solo, so I cozied up to the bar, which was fine by me. I had friendly, attentive service, and there is a full menu at the bar. 

There is only one vegan option, but serious props for that, as a lot of hotel restaurants lack even meaningful vegetarian choices! I had the crispy quinoa with vegetables, and it was good. I don't really have much else to say about it: it was good.. not bad, not great.

They have a huge selection of interesting cocktails, which I heard other patrons commenting positively on. 

I am not sure I would make a point to come here, but it was definitely worth the visit while staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"I was hired to handle a portion of a team building event late this afternoon on the outdoor patio at blue hound.  It was unexpectedly 98 degrees and in the sun. The \"all hands on deck effort\" to move umbrellas in to shade participants was handled beautifully, abd the manager and staff rocked.  Thank you blue hound.  Well done.  Excellent save. I trust this staff."}
{"text":"Good spot downtown.  Great decor, if you really like the restoration hardware look.  Service was sort of meh....we had the pork belly sliders for a starter-they were good but I didn't think they were the greatest.  I had the tucson chow da, it was good...but honestly it was mussels clams and two shrimp in a cream and pepper broth, the little fingerlings were good but seemed like an afterthought.  

The drinks were good here, very good.  The Romeo and violette was different, could easily drink those by the pint.  Margaritas were some of the best around.   

Suffered from mediocre service and an honestly not too memorable dining.  Good...but I don't think I'd go back for dinner.  Definitely would hit this place up for a drink or three."}
{"text":"We were very underwelmed. I had reserveration @ 7pm for 4, were seated and waited 20 minutes before someone came over and served us water and said I'll be back to get your drink order.  Another 5 minutes the assistant manager came over and started apologizing that someone would help us soon.  My husband was getting upset so she just ran got a pen and took our drink orders.  We ordered our food which was ok, we did have the couple appetizier then short ribs (good) but our califlower came out 10 minutes after we were served our ribs. Wouldn't recommend, wouldn't go back.  This was our second visit, the first time was much better."}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Phoenix! We had a kind server and lovely seats with interesting view, as we were surrounded by sky scrapers. Our dishes were tasty, though I found there to be some downsides...the ribs we ordered as an appetizer were flavorful, though someone in the kitchen went heavy on the salt. We also had these fried meat balls with rice inside, atop a thick tomato sauce--this was possibly the best dish of the evening. For my entrée, I ordered the Papardelle, which was good. Still, parpadelle noodles are to be wide, but, these were straight up lasagna noodles (????). My boyfriend ordered a steak and thoroughly enjoyed it, except for the potatoes which felt undercooked to him and bland. Some real hits here, but also needs some improvement"}
{"text":"Thank you to Brian and his team for going  above and beyond to make our anniversary celebration special. Wonderful food  and service!  Highly recommend the deviled eggs, ahi tuna appetizer, brussel sprouts and shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"As hotel guests...I'm shocked at the level of service on a Thursday night. We sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes with empty drinks and watched the bartender wait on customer after customer that walked up next to us and didn't even acknowledge us. Will never be back to this establishment again"}
{"text":"Yet another amazing experience at Blue Hound! I always love going there for their ambiance and creative menu items. Not only is the place great to look at, but my server was too! Chris W was very attentive and knowledgable, especially with the cocktails. I started with the Lawless, then went to the Young and Famous and finished with an excellent old fashioned. For dinner I had the scallops which were so perfectly seared, paired with the most perfect sauce! 

I heard the shishito peppers are good, I'll be coming back to try those! Thank you for the excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"Blue Hound blew my mind!

I know it has been said 100 times, but this really IS what downtown needs. No more chains or mediocre hotel restaurants - but a classy, unique downtown destination with an honest to goodness \"mixologist\" running the bar.  

They offer a decent sized happy hour menu featuring about 6 of their cocktails at 6 bucks a pop, $3 beers, and $6 flatbreads,. I had a smashing good time with my Summer Smashes and enjoyed tastes of all the well crafted cocktails my friends ordered.  We were even given an ice bucket for a can of beer (classy! Like I said!). The flatbread was so flavorful and rich, even though it was a bit on the small size.  Our waiter, Zack, handled our large party very well and didn't bat an eye when we asked for separate checks. 

Nicely split sections with a lounge, bar, and restaurant Blue Hound can host a variety of different moods and a cocktail for every occasion!"}
{"text":"While i usually don't update reviews, I feel this was absolutely necessary. I'm rarely one to write off a restaurant after the first try, so we decided to come back and check it out for dinner. We had reservations and had to move the reservation due to a delay in babysitter, and they were super accomodating. Awesome! We started with the Zucchini corn dogs with green goddess dressing. This was a really cool, well done app. it was literally little pieces of zucchini on a stick in corn dog batter. Super whimsical and a great dish to snack on. wifey jsut had the cheese plate (we DID have a big lunch)  but not me. I saw braised pork neck and I was in. How's this sound. \"braised pork neck with hominy, pickled onions, avocado and grilled bread\"...if that didn't make your mouth water, I'm pretty sure somewhere you just killed a smurf. And the dish was just as awesome as it sounded. It came in a litle cast iron skillet with a bit of broth. Just super tender meat, great flavor and a melange of textures. I can not wait to go back and get it again, it's the best dish I've had in Phx in a while. We also had a great server, super attentive and on point. all in all, i can easily say that Blue Hound has redeemed itself."}
{"text":"This spot came up during my research of tasty food, and also recommended by locals. There was a blue hound dog welcoming us next to the host/hostess station. The first area is occupied mainly by a large bar. They had a few happy customers enjoying some drinks.

They had two dining areas, one with the bar and the back room which seems to be the main dining area. The space is pretty dim, producing relaxing and romantic atmosphere.

The cocktail menu had a name and description of the drink on one page, followed by the photo of each drinks. It was nice to be able to see what the cocktails would look like before deciding which one to order. I actually picked the cocktail from the photo, since I knew I wanted one with egg whites on top. I went with a cocktail named Lion King. I loved the egg whites, exactly what I wanted! It was topped with black berry which was a bit sour. The cocktail itself was really tasty, sweet and elegant, delicious cocktail.

For food, I decided to order two appetizers as both appetizers and main, so that I can try more than one items without stuffing myself. I ordered Corn Grit Fries and Pulled Pork Sliders.

Portion of the Corn Grits was more than enough to share, my co-worker also got to have couple of pieces. It was a bit too heavy to stay in one piece, as I tried to pick it up with a fork. It was tasty but I think I had a too high of an expectation, that it didn't wow me. Pulled Pork Sliders were much better, very tasty and comforting. Really enjoyed it!  

I ended the dinner with a dessert called BHKC Pudding. It was simple but very tasty. Creamy and velvety with nice firm consistency. Nice way to end the pleasant meal."}
{"text":"I have many business meetings here but I am not that big of a fan. I get a burger and salad here mainly and its okay. I don't know if i would recommend this spot with other restaurants near that are fantastic like Arrogant Butcher or Hanny's. Maybe just not my cup of tea. Also i have only gone at lunch time so maybe the food is different at night but just my thought. Its a great location downtown and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place hit all my bullet points. I loved the decor right off the bat, and we were greeted with a friendly host--great first impression. Our server was incredibly helpful in recommending drinks (I chose The Darkness and would absolutely order it again). We started with the endless butterscotch chile popcorn (because how could you not?), and had a hard time selecting entrees because they all looked so delicious. I chose a half order of the beef short ribs with grits and a side of french fries, and my friend opted for a shot (yes, they offer shots, cups, and bowls of soup--genius) of their yummy cauliflower soup and a half order of the pork belly. I enjoyed both of our choices immensely, and next time I will think ahead and not fill up on the popcorn to save room for dessert.

I will definitely be returning. The great service and food was well worth it. The only advice I can give is to park underground at Cityscape (they will validate in the restaurant), and make sure you go to the second floor to find the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for a cocktail week event and was treated amazingly by the super friendly staff. The place is gorgeous, the decor ,the bar the seating and waiting areas are great. The event had us try some of their drinks that were good and and we tried their brunch. The French toast the quiche was good but the bacon was to die for the thick peppered one specially. The place is every bit as cool as everyone says it is. I'm dying to go back and try their dinner and also sit on the bar and try some their drinks of their cockatil menu. Fun place in the middle of downtown phx and I really enjoyed my visit and look forwars to many more."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.
Trendy- yeah. Big deal.
Service at the bar for brunch on a Sunday morning was literally shocking. Bartender didn't smile once, I swear. It was not busy at all, yet it took her 10 min to make us 4 mimosas and another 5 minutes for a bloody, because she was busy cleaning other glassware right in front of us. 

Food took 35-40 minutes to get to us and was absolutely pathetic portion size wise and wasn't even that good! She never asked us how anything was and we all left there still hungry (and broke). 

We were never offered refills on our \"bottomless mimosas\", had to ask every single time.

The only silver living is that a manager or just other co worker came over to us and was friendly and accommodating, since our check was wrong. I would never come back here ever again. There are so many other amazing places, especially for breakfast near this place. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Before a Suns game recently, my Family and I stopped into Blue Hound for some drinks and appetizers.  We attempted to go to Arrogant Butcher (been there many times), but it was packed.  Having heard good things from another family member, we decided to give Blue Hound a try, and I'm glad we did.  The inside decor is trendy and simple.  We sat at the couch by the door (since that was what was available) and were quite comfortable - except for the occasional draft from the door.  Our waitress was ok, she wasn't entirely too friendly, but she took care of our needs.

As for the food, we ordered pretty much all the appetizers.  The biggest highlight was the scones with bacon jam.  In fact, it was so good, it's inspired me to make these two things at home to see if I can replicate it.  We also had the popcorn, which was good and the sliders, which were alright.  The pizza with duck was great (could have been crisper) as was the other items we had.

Based on the previous reviews it seems this place, being new, might be hit or miss.  I'd say give it a try if you're in the area... why not?  Trust me, it's worth a visit for the cheddar scallion scones with bacon jam!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch! The food was delectable; huge portions! We ordered a couple items that were unable to be prepared due to lack of ingredients but the staff went above and beyond to compensate. Amazing service and super cute birthday card for Mom. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Visited Blue Hound for the first time with a friend last night. Very cool atmosphere. Very classy. The lighting is dim and orange, offered up primarily from vintage-style Edison bulbs hung from the ceiling. Sure enough, you're met by the statue of a blue hound upon entering.

Blue Hound was busy when we arrived at around 10:00p, but we were able to find seats at the bar. Turns out, this was the best place for us to sit.

We were helped by a super competent bartender named Bobby. It was very obvious that he loved what he was doing. The drink options were super crafty and Bobby was especially knowledgable about every topic we discussed with him.

We didn't order any food, but I would love to go back and experience their food menu sometime soon.

The drinks were costly, but you definitely get what you pay for - both in quality of beverage and in quality of service. In fact, the cocktails in particular were VERY reasonably priced for the quality of what you got.

I enjoyed my time at Blue Hound - I'll definitely be back. If you haven't been, get yourself a little dressed up and go give it a shot - you won't be disappointed. Well done, Blue Hound! And thanks, Bobby, for a really nice time.  :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Blue Hound on a Friday night, surprised to find it much less busy than expected. We seated ourselves at the side bar and were promptly greeted and given menus. The cocktail list is intriguing and extensive, without being overwhelming. The food menu had a number of great options--a mix of comfort food and little plates that all sounded delicious. We went with the cheese board, which--at $22--was a bit pricey, was well worth it. It was comprised of 3 different cheeses(a manchego, an aged cheddar, and a delightfully funky sheeps' milk cheese), plus marcona almonds, prosciutto, Granny Smith Apple slices, dates, coarse mustard, pickled green beans, pickled peppers, and a lovely spiced flatbread and a soft brown bread. I ordered the Brown Derby, a bourbon based cocktail that was exactly what I'd been craving--a wonderful balance of sweet and tangy. Hubby had the Zombie, and it was the best Zombie we've ever had. Overall, Blue Hound is the perfect spot for date night--laid back but still romantic and interesting(without being pretentious), and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Blue Hound do a solid meal. The corn bread and the skate were first class and the scallops were also pretty tasty. Cocktails are also awesome and have generous pours.

If you get the chance, sit out on the balcony and kick back. The view is good and given that right now PHX isn't scorching hot, its also a pretty nice place to chill after work."}
{"text":"Usually this place is 4 stars, but it gets knocked down because tonight our service was particularly bad. Left our table to get drinks at the bar twice, even though the restaurant wasn't particularly busy. Knocks it down to a 3, especially when I was just telling my friend how great the service is here..."}
{"text":"Beautiful, homey restaurant, and the food is great.  The service is attentive, and the seating is comfortable.  The drawback is the noise.  This restaurant is loud!  Don't expect to have a quiet, romantic dinner here, but it is definitely energetic.  The shrimp and grips is an amazing dish, but save room for the chocolate cake (it really needs twice as much of the marvelous banana ice cream, though)."}
{"text":"Incredible Dinner and Wine menu!!  My wife and I went here with family and all enjoyed the dinner as well as the ambiance.  The staff were friendly and polite and knew exactly when to approach the table to avoid interrupting conversations.  Food preparation time was reasonable and the dessert was amazing!

Would recommend to family and friends.  Blue Hound and Kitchen is also an ideal location in downtown phoenix if you are taking in any one of the live events that are all close by and in walking distance."}
{"text":"This place is OKAY food is not as good as it should be for the price. We sat for a solid 15 min before we got drinks they were slammed but not my problem. Cool place to drink but dinner was nothing special. I did have brunch here though & that was great so I would suggest that."}
{"text":"Short ribs, tater tots, and potato leek gratin were amazing!  Great waitstaff and ambiance.  -can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Blue Hound is fantastic!  We started of with the shishito peppers and they were DELISH!! Our main meal included the home made pasta, added some shrimp, and the pork shank with risotto!  The pasta was done al dente with a great sauce!  The pork shank was so tender we didn't even need a knife!!! Highly recommend this place before any event downtown! By the way, Lost melody drink was tasty!! Gemma did a great job and was on top of everything even though it was busy!!"}
{"text":"I came into Blue Hound recently and I received spectacular service. Rob was friendly, professional, attentive, and very helpful with recommendations. I had a delicious meal and a fantastic cocktail. The atmosphere was perfect. I definitely will be back with others."}
{"text":"Would so have given 5 stars if it wasn't hot as hell in here. We love Jesse, Jake, and Patrick, they have made making drinks an art and we love them all. Literally the best mixologists around. The drinks are delicious just tell them what you base liquor is and they will create magic every time."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Blue Hound - and I am a fan.

First things first - it's a bit hard to find due to it being in the Palomar hotel. Just go to the Lobby of the Palomar (which isn't at street level FYI) and turn right. Voila. You are there. 

This was the first time I have been here for dinner, the other was for lunch. So I waited for my friend at the bar. So, for it being a pretty small bar - and I was sitting at it - it took a long time for a bar tender to come and ask what I wanted. In fact, it wasn't until my friend got there that they even asked. I would rate the bar service not so great. Another instance of trying to do side work, and not paying attention to who is at the bar. And, then we ordered two simple drinks - a glass of chardonnay and a tanqueray rocks, and that even took some serious time to get.

For starters - I would definitely recommend them. Deviled eggs are awesome, although fundamentally a little odd to get at a restaurant and not a backyard bbq. Fried green tomatoes are delish and definitely try the short rib sliders. My only issue with the short rib sliders is I am not such a fan of the sweet rolls, but the meat is awesome.

For dinner, I think I am a little hung up here. I can't say I loved the stuffed chicken. (Does not appear to be on the menu anymore.) Turned out a bit dry for me. But the accompaniments were great - cauliflower, veggies, etc. 

Overall, it's a neat place. I like the setting, I am just not sure of the food. Appears to be a southern twist - so I am thrown off by the trout, shrimp, etc., as they just aren't my thing. But I think it's a good place to go for a drink and some apps."}
{"text":"So...I had a hankering for the lemon-blueberry ricotta pancakes and met up with some of my pals to satisfy the craving this past Sunday.  We were greeted warmly by Sergio who kept us well stocked with coffee and water.  My pals had burrata and chillaquiles; I had the pancakes and some yummy chicken sausage.  My only quibble was the acoustic guitar and his amp turned up to 11....the interior is not conducive to the volume.  Other than that, it was a lovely morning and I enjoyed the company and the chow."}
{"text":"A little overpriced and not the greatest of food, but it's solid if your in town as a tourist or there for business and want something close in downtown."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch and had a good time.  Service was friendly and quick.  The food was delicious- I had the French toast.  Only drank a mimosa and it was fine.  I liked the atmosphere most!  This is a great place for a girlfriend brunch away from kids."}
{"text":"My gal and I were in the Kimpton hotel for a quick staycation and ended up going down stairs to the house restaurant, the Blue Hound, for appetizers and drinks before heading out for the night... 

They changed up their deviled eggs and while they were good, they weren't as good as they once were. 

The drinks were serviceable but some of the other appetizers weren't what was expected. Though they were happy hour prices the portion sizes weren't what was expected.

The bartender was nice enough and fairly engaging but she was at the end of her shift and seemed a bit distracted as she was setting up for the next guy.

We'll be back... it's good enough to visit for another round of drinks... but we'll probably end up making it one of the stops of the night vs. the place we end up at for an extended period of time."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Our server Chris W. was very informative and recommended some pretty delicious picks. The pork belly sliders were so tasty I immediately regretted splitting the small portion and only having 1! My friend that joined me said the deviled eggs were the best she's ever had... and that comes from a deviled egg connoisseur. The place filled up fast for dinner and our service didn't suffer at all but I definitely recommend making a reservation...this place gets busy! Overall I would definitely dine here again and recommend it to anyone that's going to be in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Love the vibe. It was so nice to sit on the deck and watch the ice skaters while enjoying my dinner. The bar looked like a cool place to hang out too. Good energy. Nice lighting and decor. The food was... Pretty good. I tried a number of appetizers. The deviled eggs were unexceptional. They tried doing something interesting with this sweet bacon in there but it could have used a bit more punch and a little less sweet. The deviled fried oysters also lacked that punch. But they were tasty on their own and nicely fried. The grits they came with were an odd accompaniment. The short rib sliders were quite good. Although again could have used some other flavor - some tartness or some spice to offset the umami short rib. The Brussels sprouts were outstanding! Sautéed with a Korean style barbecue sauce. Not too sweet, which I often find to be the case. I am definitely going to steal this recipe! I will probably go back and try an entree next time."}
{"text":"The Blue Hound at the hip and stylish Palomar Hotel made me howl with happiness.  Will you have to drop some significant green at The Blue?  Sure. But the service on the night I visited was pristine and attentive.  Presentation fantastic.  Interesting mixture of colors, flavors, and textures all around.  I will say that the roast cauliflower appetizer was a tad too undercooked for my taste, but the combination with pistachios and raisins was an nice blend of flavors.  If you're looking for a delightfully swanky downtown dinner and cocktail spot, this place is it."}
{"text":"Awesome service, Sophie and Carolina were attentive and very helpful . Food, wine and hand crafted cocktails were superb. Salads were fresh, charcuterie appetizer was very filling and offered a varied array of meats and cheeses. Trout entree and pork sliders were excellent. Visited twice during our stay in Phoenix. Will be repeat customers when we come again."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a few drinks but it's a nice bar! I had Bloody Mary's, my friend had the Rose all day. Patrick was really nice and talkative. He was also extremely hot. We are wondering what life is like when you're that attractive? He has a bad sense of distance though. A walk to Desoto central market definitely isn't just \"down the street.\" Anyway, we will be back for drinks!"}
{"text":"Well I've stayed too many times at the Kimpton to not have eaten here. But we try to avoid it. 

Food is not bad but it's not great, it definitely satisfies hunger. 

The staff has a bit of a snooty attitude, especially when you tell the the truth when they ask how your meal was. Response \" could have been better\". Maybe I rubbed them the wrong way but I'm not going to lie about how I was not satisfied with the way the food tasted. 

Drinks are ok

Breakfast is decent, please just stick to the waffles/pancakes (something safe) and you will have a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Great staff quick service and amazing menu. You need to start with the fries, Charred Pork Belly Sliders, Shishito Peppers, Hickman's Farm Deviled Eggs and the International cheese plate called Family Farmed Cheeses and if you are still hungry, order the seafood stew called Low Country Stew and/or the ribeye. If you like to drink, please order the Lawless. An amazing whiskey drink with some great aromas!"}
{"text":"I am not worthy to write a review. 
Chief Currid I am a fan and am sure that one day you will be recognized for your superb receipes a and plate presentations. Server Jeremy you are the cherry on the cake!!  
It is a sin if you do not eat here. 
By far this is the best place."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at the Blue Hound. We brought our 6 year old and felt comfortable with him. The service was great and we enjoyed a range of flavors with our meal. Easy Open Table reservations before the Suns game made getting a table simple. Ordered the cheese, meat and fruit platter to start. Nice wide range of flavors with no stinky cheese. I shared the blackened salmon with my son and my husband got the port shank. Salmon was moist and flavorful. Green beans were perfect with it. Pork shank came right off the bone and mixed nicely with the beans and rice. For dessert the fruit crisp with vanilla ice cream. There were no left overs of anything! I had to  to take away a star because it was a bit overpriced. $115 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine and 1 dessert to share."}
{"text":"Don't bother unless you happen to be down there with money to burn.  I have to say--that after you find the place--the look of the space is wonderful and I could see sitting and having a drink--but for the money I will go someplace else.  I made a reservation--we did not arrive together --even though other than the bar, the place was empty--they initially sat us at two different tables--i also got an email from Open Table saying the reservation had been cancelled--which I assume means that they didn't think we showed up--even though they sat the party twice.  

on to the food--the food is overpriced, small portions and underwhelming.  we started with a little, tiny bowl of mac and cheese--there are so many places in town that have taken this to an art form--this place isn't one of them.  two friends got one of the salads and didn't even finish it even though they split because it wasn't very good.  one friend ordered the chicken fried chicken sliders which they serve  on this little wooden platter--why?  they were messy and pieces of chicken were falling to the table.  I had the scallops and they were just okay--but certainly not worth the price.

on to the service--to many servers too much time --at one point there were five people providing service and at other times you could have bowled in the place and not hit a server--service was off and on and did not lend anything to the meal.

i probably won't be back--there are so many other places to go --that have really good food, great service and prices that don't make you feel liked someone just picked your pocket."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy and really great atmosphere. I'm not much of a dessert person but the pineapple upside down cake was awesome. Also the fried green tomatoes with lump crab were delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre for the price. There are many unique choices on the menu but the taste does not match the creativity of the dishes. I had their New Cuban specialty drink & that was worth it. The drinks are good, so it's definitely a place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Ask for Rob, his old fashioned's will change your life. Came here with my now fiancée!!!!!! Finally!! A man who can drink like I can!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Drinks are delicious, food is divine, service is perfect. Cute servers, cute cooks through the window, perfect lighting. I've never been to a more atmospheric restaurant. 3.5 star average is a joke. I'd give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"What a perfect date place! I didn't realize from the pictures how intimate it actually is.  

Make sure to call ahead for reservations! I made one the morning of and the earliest I could get a table for two was at 9pm. 

The service was amazing, and the drinks were even better. I had some kind of Rose infused gin drink, I can't find the name of it, but it was fantastic. All of the drinks from the menu sounded wonderful, I can't wait to try more. 

For dinner I had Roast Chicken with veggies. The skin on the chicken was so crispy I LOVE crispy chicken skin. My date had the fried catfish. Definitely recommend both. 

The only thing is I wish bread was included with the meal! It was $12 off the appetizer menu, and I couldn't get myself to splurge for it. I also wish the dessert menu was a little bit more variable. I was in the mood for dessert, but none of them were doing it for me unfortunately. 

But would love to come back! It's a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"The Kale Cesar Salad is amazing.  The steak on the dinner menu is right on if you ask the server not to poor the salad all over it because the steak will taste too vinegar-ry and tart.  I like to have my steak served without the sides piled on top of it.  Just incase I dont want the flavor mixing.  The trout is a MUST HAVE.  The decor is beautiful and very modern (reminds me of the NE restaurants).  The servers are AMAZINGLY polite and the bar tender is the same.  The greeter or host sets the tone with a beautiful smile and welcoming warm and polite \"Welcome\"  Great job."}
{"text":"Came into the bar area with 6 people for drinks and appetizers. Great atmosphere, drink menu, and food menu! However, the bartender Greg served first round of drinks and never came back! We flagged a barback to order appetizers. All empty drinks with no attention, we asked the barback for our tab. The crabby bartender was the reason I didn't give this place five stars or spend more money."}
{"text":"Blue Hound has been on my list for a while now.  Finally got to get down here and have some food and drinks.  

It's on the second level just above Squid Ink.  The place was 70% empty on a Friday night so it really wasn't the best sign.  We were seated by the windows in the back corner and had our own little private booth.

The decor and ambiance is very sleek.  Felt like a really cool place to hang out.  

Our waitress was polite and took our drink and app order.  I got a whiskey sour with egg white.  My wife ordered a moscow mule.  We also ordered the corn grit fries and shishito peppers.

The corn grit fries were excellent.  They were really nothing like fries.  They were more like cheese tater tot sticks.  The bacon and cheese in them was very tasty.  The weird part was the sauce that came with them.  It was almost like a marinara sauce.  It really didn't go with the flavor of the cheesy tater tot sticks at all.

The shishito peppers were also excellent.  And the sauce with them was perfect.  I'd order these again in a heartbeat.

The drinks were good but awfully short and not worth 14 bucks a pop.

We split a kale salad as we were going to head to another spot nearby to have some food and drinks and didn't want to blow all our appetite here.  The kale salad was okay for me and my wife loved it.

Overall Blue Hound was good and in a great location with good service but I'm thinking this is more of a place to come during happy hour as it was a bit pricey for just our couple apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a business meeting/lunch. Parking was a bit hard, but doable. 

Food was great and drinks were awesome. Service was fast, attentive, and authentic. 

Trendy cool place to go, definitely a worth while when in the area."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here and trying to like it more, but this place has lost so much character. It has SO much potential. The atmosphere is of a place nowhere in phoenix without even trying. The cocktails are fabulous and the food is great. However, there always feels like there's something missing. Like the place is doing just enough to get by. On the past two or three occasions I've come here, the service has been so disappointing. Mostly from the bartenders. They make an awesome drink! And that's it. No conversation, no upselling, no intrigue, nothing that makes you feel like they enjoy being part of the staff. The whole ambience is lost on them. I remember coming in years ago with a group of my friends on my birthday, we were the last and only group and we had a spectacular bartender who roused us with great drinks and fabulous storytelling/conversation. He was handsome, charming, funny, and welcoming. I never see that anymore. On Friday night, we were glanced over, unattended and brushed off, and just not engaged. The whole air inside is that no one cares. I truly think if this place wasn't attached to the palomar, it'd have closed down long ago. It pains me to think that because Blue Hound has so much potential! Its hip, its cool, it's delicious! It just lacks charisma and energy. Any time a place like this is empty on a friday night, that's a sign."}
{"text":"Went her after a Diamondbacks game. Came between lunch and dinner (3-5). They only have a limited bar menu during those times.

Friendly staff and nice setup.

Had the Blue Hound Burger, it was recommended by the waitress, very good. Not listed, but you have the option of having a salad instead of the fries.

Look forward to trying this place out for lunch or dinner (full menu)."}
{"text":"Gorgeously well built bar! I loved the dark wood and open feel. It was packed during happy hour and they offer a few drinks for a decent price (i believe it was $6 a drink) and all of their flatbreads are half off. I ordered the gorgonzola one and it had a very interesting flavor. It wasn't my favorite. The rest of the menu sounded divine so I do plan on coming back soon."}
{"text":"Fabulous decor inside. Really cool place. They had music, ( a very talented guy on guitar/vocals ) which was great. But from the moment we sat down, the service was slow and the food took 50 minutes to be served. The restaurant was not busy what so ever, so there was NO excuse. Just another example of a restaurant  with poor to no management. It seemed like the place was being run by a bartender, on waiter, and a cook..... So much potential, but they don't take their fine establishment seriously. The \"bottomless\" Bloody Mary seemed to be mostly mix, next to no vodka."}
{"text":"Deviled eggs: Delicious, Fried Green Tomatoes: Amazing, Ahi Tuna: Very Good, Chocolate Pudding: Seriously Fantastic, Chocolate Cake: Not so good, kind of dry. Overall: Great place"}
{"text":"I found that their HH menu contains a lot of spicier fare which I am not a fan of and its a limited menu at that.  The cocktails however are delicious still a bit pricey.  Sitting out on the patio is better than being indoors IMO."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very upscale/romantic. The menu is limited but in a good way. Try the homemade pasta - it's unreal!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place for a romantic date night! Awesome food and extensive brown liquor list! My husband ordered flatbread and ribs and both were great! I had the blackened salmon with asparagus cooked to perfection. We will most definitely be back, prices were good and staff was great!"}
{"text":"We came to take advantage of a promotion of $35pp for 3 courses. Due to construction we opted for valet ($10+tip). On the second floor we found Blue Hound, with a big modern seating area with a glowing fire, couches and chairs -- nice entry/first impression. 

Service was sweet but bumpy. The food runner struggled with the heavy plates and seemed so eager to set them down, we kept having to redirect her to put the right plate in front of the right person. The time between the apps and the main course was way too long. No major foils but for the price level it just should be a lot smoother. To top off our slightly fumbly meal, at the end, we were asked to produce the promotional email for the 3 course deal  -- not the  confirmation mind, but the original marketing email -- even though we followed the instructions weeks ago that stated all we had to do was email our reservation with the promo code. Causing confusion and an awkward attempt by a few at the table to take out their phones in search of the email. Weird.

But drinks came out quickly (appreciated since they aren't just two-pour deals) and the server was fairly knowledgeable about the cocktail menu. Speaking of drinks ... this place prides itself on its bar offerings and almost every drink clocked in at $10 (at least). Eep. They had a whole section for booze aficionados that uses hard-to-find ingredients/odd pairings but ... I don't know. $20 for two drinks is A LOT, especially if you're experimenting with new liquors and ingredients as their drink menu encourages you to do. 

Food pleased/impressed, for the most part. First course we ordered the mac and cheese, and the cheddar scallion biscuits with fried quail eggs and bacon jam (another thing about this place - they're on the bacon train big time, including bacon ice cream ... eh, I think everyone got over that trend before it even started); and roasted cauliflower. For mains we had a pork porterhouse, ribs with bleu cheese grits and pumpkin flatbread. The pork was good but not great, flatbread was a little boring (no pumpkin or sage flavors really popping out) and one of only substantial veggie options on the menu. The ribs were probably the star of the table - it's the size of a dinosaur bone and cooked perfectly. Desserts tried included fresh donut holes, chocolate crème brulee, treacle pudding and lime sorbet. All pretty good to excellent (though I wouldn't bother with the donut holes again, fresh but nothing special, flavor-wise).

In summary, the experience taste-wise was exactly what I was craving after living in the UK for a more than a year: that is, classic American comfort food sussed up gourmet style. But overall I don't know the food or drink prices are justifiable for a return dinner visit. However, atmosphere is modern and classy, the drinks were excellent and the care and passion put toward them is noted and appreciated - they're just a bit expensive for me. I ended up spending $140+tip for two and one of us wasn't even having cocktails!

If I still lived in Phoenix, I would probably file this one in the \"only for happy hour\" category, since they have discounted offerings for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Very casual chic. 

Our server was prompt in greeting us and very nice. He resented cocktail menus and I couldn't decide because they all looked delish! My friend and I started with the Desert Gin & Tonic and Lost Melody. The Gin & Tonic was extra good because it was made with premium ingredients but mine was sublime! One of those dangerous drinks that will go down easy and sneak up on ya. 

APPETIZERS: 

TATER TOTS: smoked bacon, chive, romesco sauce  - adult version of the school lunch favorite. Very tasty.

CHARRED PORK BELLY SLIDERS: kimchi, peanuts on King's Hawaiian bread - We ordered the half order (2). But after we were done, we looked at each other like...we should have ordered 4! 

DINNER: 

POT PIE: root vegetables, mushrooms, swiss chard - Pretty darn good. I didn't even miss the meat! 

BBQ'D BEEF SHORT RIBS w/ Anson Mills' blue cheese grits - One large Flintstone bone in a cast iron bowl. The meat was tender and the flavor was amazing. The taste and texture of the grits were on point too. My only \"beef\" was that it came out room temperature. Which made the grits congeal a little. I was very disappointed by that and felt the dish could have been even better if it were hot! 

MORE DRINKS: 

LAWLESS: Breaking & Entering bourbon, bitters, wormwood liqueur, tobacco smoked glass. Great presentation and perfectly balanced flavors. 

Finally - desert was the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake and coffee. The cake was really good. Again a classic that was on point. They must have a thing with food temperature, because the decaf coffee was ice cold! 

Our server was overwhelmed by a large table at the restaurant . We often felt like things took too long...like the food, the check and clearing out plates between servings. 

Otherwise, we had a great experience and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"My last experience here was FAR more positive than my first.  I was seated promptly and the waitress made a point of asking if we were going to the concert at Talking Stick.  She wanted to make sure our food order wasn't behind a large party so we wouldn't be late - love that!  

The cocktails were delicious and my pasta was fabulous.  Had we not had to get to a show, I might have liked to linger for perhaps another cocktail and maybe dessert."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is that it's attached to the Palomar Hotel so you can come by and have a snack or drink, then hang out right next door in the lush and glamorous hotel lounge by the fire, and finally when you get tired of that, there's still more to do, head up to the second floor to the Lustre bar, a rooftop bar with views overseeing Phoenix. The proximity of so many neat and diverse areas makes for a very fun and adventurous date night! Had a great time, loved it all, and will be back!"}
{"text":"Phil was excellent the female bartender however was the worst bartender I have had in years. She was so unfriendly by our entire party that we may never be back. She did however make good drinks. So give or take I guess. She would have had a way better tip with nicer service.  We did not have food so can not comment on that."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the bomb. The food is amazing and the service is wonderful. Good selection of food and great patio outside. If you are staying in downtown this is a must to go out and eat at. The selection is pretty slim in downtown so take an u ER and get here now!"}
{"text":"Love this place and by far the best place I visited in the 10 days I was in Phoenix.  Staff was on top of it with menu items and drinks. Food was excellent and exactly what they said.  Don't travel to Phoenix much but when I do I will be back. Great environment and location downtown was great for me."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix! Shrimp and grits! Flatiron steak! Fried tomatoes! SO GOOOOD. I mean, AWESOME! The ambiance is everything I would want in my dream home. Nice view over looking the skate rink and Christmas tree. Beautiful. Service was perfect. Definitely a place for a romantic evening, in my eyes! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I ordered the chilaquilas with a bloody mary.  Everyone does their chilaquilas different so I had NO idea what to expect.  Well well well there people - when it arrived - layered meaty chip goodness with a fried egg on top!!!  I was in mouth watering heaven - and it was a HUGE portion, couldn't finish it.  The meat was tender, green chili was sweet and the bloody mary went so good with it all. I will definitely be back for the dinner menu - without a doubt.  Nice lunch surprise and left needing a little nap.  Thank you Blue!"}
{"text":"There were three of us and we're seated promptly at our reservation time.  Waitress was very attentive and needed to be told to slow it down, that we were in for a lesierly meal.   For appetizers we had the fried green tomatoes with lump crab meat ( dreams are made from these - delicious ) and also the deviled eggs ( good - but too cold ).  For entree I had the shrimp & grits - had to remember my manners and not lick the bowl clean.  Also ordered by our guest was, as she called it, \"The Pig\", it was the chop - literally fell of the bone.  She said the gravy was very good.  A great place to bring a client or out for a nicer evening with your spouse / date.  BTW, very nice scotch selection!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Blue Hound's catering service. The food was great and the atmosphere made my birthday super special. Brooke was my sales coordinator-she is a ray of sunshine to work with! She will respond to emails and your questions promptly and is incredibly attentive and focused on customer service. I cannot wait to book your services again!

{"text":"After a so-so experience at a steakhouse the day before, I had higher hopes for this place. Once again I was with a group eating on someone else's dime, so price was no concern except as a way to judge value. 

It's nestled in a corner of a high-rise surrounded by other anonymous corporate quarters. It aspires to be more than a place for suits to get lunch, however. The menu has signature cocktails, small plates and offbeat entrees that call out to foodies and hipsters, \"You're special, and we know it.\"

We had small plate/appetizers for the table, including roasted shishito peppers, cheese plate, deviled eggs and tater tots. I really liked the peppers and eggs, which had fried yolks as well as the usual whipped yolks. Cheese plate was a nice selection of good quality cheeses. Tots were just okay.

My entrée was a braised beef short rib on grits. The presentation was a knockout, with a Flintstones size rib poking over the edge of the bowl with the grits at the bottom. Rib was evidently roasted to finish, giving it a little char flavor, and the texture was still a little toothy, not fall off the bone tender, which is better for a short rib I think.

Service was good but cool, as you should expect in a place like this. Overall a good experience, but I give it three rather than four stars because I think the prices are not in line with the cuisine. Maybe being in downtown means high rent, which forces them to charge like this, but I wouldn't pay those prices if it were my money."}
{"text":"The food here was very yummy! Troy was an excellent server who shared some interesting information with us about the theme of this restaurant! Service was great and I couldn't have asked for a better date night!"}
{"text":"Finally a bar in Phoenix that understand mixology! Great drinks!  Bar staff is friendly and atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Love their deviled eggs, ahi tuna salad and old fashioned with buffalo trace! The library/den wooden oak lounge feel is equally appealing. Great place for sips, eats and convo's or a quiet lunch solo like I had."}
{"text":"The Blue Hound at CityScape in downtown Phoenix is a delightfully hip addition to the burgeoning Phoenix downtown dining scene. It features a reasonably priced New American (tilted toward Southern) menu, with a selection of great entrees and an outstanding cocktail list.  There is a very cool bar, that is right off the adjoining Hotel Palomar.

We split a delicious chopped salad, that reminded us a lot of the chopped salad at Citizen Public House in Scottsdale.  Not sure if there is an ownership overlap or a bit of plagiarism, but in any case, it was yummy.  My wife had the shrimp and grits and I had the swordfish entree.  Both were prepared well and and delivered promptly by our server.  Once again, both high on the yummy scale!

For dessert we shared the cherry pie, which was every bit as tasty as a pie purchased at the legendary Rock Springs Cafe in Black Canyon City, and a lot closer to home, for most of us.  Parking in the garage next door was validated, making this a destination well worth the drive from the suburbs.  We certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food was delicious, server was very attentive and it was perfect for a quiet business lunch. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a date last night, it was my first dinning experience downtown on a friday night, and Blue Hound definitely lived up to its reputation. 
We sat in the outside patio, and it was nice and cool out and more private than the main floor. 

This place has a hip vibe, and was nicely packed at the time, the food menu was way different than I expected, but most of the items we ordered were SMASHING.

-Ribs fell off the bone, and tasted rich and actually mixed pretty damn well with blue cheese grits..who woulda thought that? 

-Corn on the Cob, (mexican street style as my waiter said) were my favorite though, you gotta try this one time, the taste is explosive lol... 

-Tater Tots- bomb-tastic, better than I've had in a minute, which is saying a lot. ha

Service was strange, but attentive. Not all in your face, which could be a good thing or bad thing for some people. Our waiter was chill though. 

drinks wre str8, but not strong which was probably a good thing in my case, lol. 

Would love to support a local business like this more on the regular, and recommend it to everyone.

4 STARS."}
{"text":"As a native southerner, I am always a little weary to try authentic southern cuisine. Let me tell you, I was Blown Away! We stumbled upon Blue Hound by accident and boy was it a happy accident! We started with the fried green tomatoes and added the crab to it. Do it. Always add the crab! The crab was so fresh and tasty. The breading on the tomatoes was perfectly crisp and a lovely texture. Such a delicious appetizer! We then had the shrimp and grits. Let me tell you, they were phenomenal! I was taken right back to Tennessee with this dish! The grits were perfectly creamy, the sauce I could drink, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly! I can not wait to get back and try more dishes. The sous chef, Logan who created our dish so graciously came out to accept our praise on an amazing job well done! He was all but embarrassed when we couldn't stop gushing about the food! Do not leave without getting the chocolate pudding! It's a perfect marriage of thick, rich chocolate mousse on top a graham cracker crust then topped with a marshmallow swirl. The swirl is then torched to give it a bit of a burnt, meringue feel. The description does not do it justice.  Our waiter, Chris W was fantastic! When you go ask for him! Friendly and so knowledgable about the menu!"}
{"text":"Came for \"happy hour\" around 5:30 today. Bar is super small and half of it is technically already Reserved. Had to grab our drinks and sit on a couch. Can't complain much though because luckily we got a spot by the fire. The atmosphere is hip and trendy, albeit it seems a little stuffy and exclusive. 
If you want a spot at the bar, May the Odds be Ever in your Favor, otherwise good luck in the lounge! If you get a couch stay and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the service wasn't good enough to make up for the rude, slow service!"}
{"text":"The place was a bit hard for me to locate especially since I don't know downtown well, I didn't realize it was inside the Palomar hotel. The ambiance of the restaurant is chic and very eye appealing, it's trendy & unique design and furniture make it a definite posh spot for an exquisite ladies night out or afternoon catch up sesh. 

We were seated right away by a very personable host & greeted by our server within 2 minutes of being sat.  He started us with some cocktails and appetizers while we perused the menu. 

Some definite must try-
Fried Green Tomato: sounds a bit strange right, but they were surprisingly good. Up for a new treat, these are for you!
Deviled Eggs: bacon jam I don't need to say anything else 
Shishito peppers: the furikaki and aioli ... Yum!
Seared ahi salad: the bed of lettuce they used was fresh and a refreshing variety when added with a piece of the seared ahi

Cocktails- loved my dirty martini but was shocked when I tried the Lawless. The drink is made with bitters, wild turkey and this awesome smoke type concoction that adds flavor to the glass itself. Honestly, watching it be made was the fun part! 

Parts of the restaurant over look a part of city scape which can be beautiful so if ever on a date night be sure to request a window table."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed chef Sean's cooking for years and was thrilled when he joined one of my favorite hotels in town. Both menus have been awesome. Some of my favorites are the burrata, shishito peppers and the Ham and cheese. His soups are also great. Foh staff is always attentive and knowledgable. I would 100% recommend dining here (great scene) and staying at the hotel. Excellent staff with awesome attitudes."}
{"text":"What a nice little place, I really must say I liked it!
Very nice looking place, with great customer service.
I loved the scotch, over one large ice cube. Perfect for me.
Happy Hour was a nice end to a rough day.
A little hard to find parking in the downtown area here.
However, it is quite a busy place,so I guess that is why.
I had no idea downtown was jamming like this!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!  Waitress was helpful with the menu and drink selection.  We took the opportunity to sample a number of different items since it was more family style, which unexpected, but perfect for trying a new restaurant with so many wonderful items. The small family farmed cheese plate was amazing!  I'm not even a big cheese fan, but it was delish!  Next we had the green chili roasted corn.  When this came out it was still on the cob, and they happily took it off the cob for us.  Again, another amazing dish.  Then we had the Kobe Beef Short Ribs - again, wonderful!

It does look like they have changed their menu some in the last month, but I would definintely check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch. Hostess proceeded to make a reservation confirmation call before addressing us, as in we were standing in front of her and she picked up the phone and dialed, not already on the phone. Really cool interior, and i really enjoyed my Duck and Cover cocktail. Food was just okay and served with a free side of pretension. Mac n cheese was very bland - needed an acidic element."}
{"text":"If your are looking for a hipster spot with good drinks and you've got money to blow this is your place. I order the lawless drink  slider  and my friend got a Salad.  Our bill was 50 bucks. Food was fair but not that good."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was absolutely amazing!  James was an enjoyable treat and an excellent waiter.  He bantered and was responsive and knew what was great on the menu!  Thanks James!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! 2 of us shared deviled eggs, chopped salad and Shrimp and Grits! Wonderful! And hubby loved the scotch menu and the English Mule was amazing! This place has a great ambiance too! Perfect for downtown Phx visitors!"}
{"text":"Had another wonderful evening at blue hound!! I've been there once before. Ambiance is like no other in Phoenix and Chris W. was amazing! Make sure to try the Lost Melody :)"}
{"text":"Its a restaurant that's still very much in its infancy and still has some kinks to work out, but so far this new downtown spot is off to a pretty good start.  My siblings and I took my Dad here for Father's Day.  Surprisingly, it was packed (not with Father's Day peeps but rather a ton of folks in town for various conventions).  The restaurant matches well with the feel of the Hotel Palomar in general.  Modern and eclectic.

As for the food?  They strongly encourage sharing dishes amongst the whole table so they offer have and full portions of all their dishes.  For vegetarians, they have a farm fresh menu of various veggie combo dishes.  For the appetizer, we got a full order of tater tots (yes, tater tots).  Decent flavor, a little oily.  For the main dish my Dad and I both got the short rib (which is huge by the way), while my bro got the fried quail, and my sis got the gizpacho.  The short rib was juicy, fall off the bone tender with a perfect char.  My brother's quail was pretty good, but we unfortunately discovered some bones still embedded in the quail.  Not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but it was an unpleasant surprise from an otherwise tasty dish.  My sister said the gizpacho was so-so.  Overall, the food was good but not great as some dishes probably still need some work.

The atmosphere of the place and the friendly wait staff made up for some of this place's shortcomings and they even comped the appetizer for sitting us in a noisy area with the convention goers.  They didn't have to do that, but it was a nice gesture.

As a whole, I would absolutely bring my friends here for happy hour as they have a really cool bar area with a decent cocktail selection and the modern look of the place is a great conversation piece.  As far as the restaurant itself, I think it has potential.  Its only been open two weeks and I know every new place goes through some growing pains, so I'm willing to give them a pass on some of menu misfires for now.  Hopefully next time I come by they'll have worked out the kinks and lived up to their potential."}
{"text":"The Blu Cheese grits were fantastic! Even better the next day. Ribs had such a unique taste. Savory & sweet."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal and cocktail here.  The manhattan was delicious!  Perfect blend of rye, bitters and peel.
Salmon seasoning was delicate yet robust on a perfectly cooked fillet.  
I look forward to returning here."}
{"text":"Blue Hound is s great bar / restaurant.  An outstanding lounge.

The cocktails are inventive and very tasty.  The food was amazing.  I had the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes.  They were perfectly made / cooked and an absolute delight to eat.

Excellent location in Phoenix, near a few jazz bars.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Very fancy schmancy for a happy hour- but it IS a hotel restaurant in downtown Phoenix... It comes with an impressive cocktail menu. The old fashioned with peach bitters is on freaking point. A great date night spot if your looking to shmoooze her. Also, their fried green tomatoes with lump crab appetizer is amazing. This place take craft cocktails and quality food to the next level."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how amazing our waiter James is. We had such an amazing time. James guided us through so many gorgeous craft cocktails. Seriously, order the \"lawless\". Stephanie, their drink MASTER, whipped up what I assume is a tobacco voodoo orgasm concoction. You will not be disappointed. 

Thanks so much for the amazing drinks, the phenomenal tater tots  and all the laughs James!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for lunch. Visiting AZ from Portland, OR. Wife and I consider ourselves junior foodies - we really enjoyed this place. Great decor, feels very open inside. The food was good. Po'Boy was nice, wife enjoyed her burger very much. She also commented positively on her salad; fun to see watermelon radishes in it. The fries were garlic-y in the best way and seasoned generously with Rosemary. Yum. Nice to see Deschutes on tap, reminds me of home. Recommended."}
{"text":"Bar is really busy on the weekends even when it is cold outside.  It has a nice patio though that looks over a pretty courtyard that houses an ice skating rink in the winter in the middle of the skyscrapers.  It feels like a little bit of NYC in the middle of Phoenix.  

Bar is western/miner themed.  Crowd is more middle aged/mature.  Not a fancy bar, it is surprisingly on the casual side for the professional area it is in.

Drinks were pretty good.  Bartenders' skills are pretty high here.  Selection of alcohol is outstanding."}
{"text":"Rob makes a mean old fashion that is life changing. BEST service I have ever received in a restaurant!  Service was fast, courteous, and flawless.  Atmosphere was perfect. I will return. I recommend you come check out Blue Hound and ask for Rob, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This was our first time to The Blue Hound. We dined here for restaurant week ,this past week.
The restaurant is a little loud,given the design of it. We could still talk,but definitely not a quiet romantic place.
The parking is $5 for the hotel valet with a stamp from the hostess stand or 2hrs complimentary in the city scape garage.
We had the farmer's market greens and the heirloom tomato appetizers. We loved them both.
For our second course we had the swordfish and the skirt steak.
Our dessert was pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate brioche.(all of this was $33./person)
There is a patio right outside the main restaurant area, but it was not being utilized the evening we dined.
Hope to be back  soon and try the poolside bar (HH) and the restaurant with the regular menu."}
{"text":"We went to Blue Hound because we had to wait to go to another bar. We enjoyed the drinks and food so much that we decided to stay here instead! 

The deviled eggs are delicious. I also really liked the chopped salad which was quite filling. The flatbread is good for sharing with friends. The cheese player could have been bigger, for the price I was a bit disappointed. 

I had the French Quarter which uses Woodford Reserve, one of my favorites. The Old Fashioned here rivals The Gladly / Citizen Pubhouse, but is still not quite on part with The Hudson in Sedona in my opinion. My fiancee got La Belle Fleur which is perfect if you like sweet and pretty drinks. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Classy place. Great section of liquor, beer and wine. Bartenders are highly skilled and can probably make anything you ask for. Prices aren't cheap though. Expect to pay around $15 for anything specialty. Half that for anything \"normal\" like a vodka tonic. They do have a happy hour menu though if you want to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is great and make sure to order a Lawless drink."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Happy Hours with friends at Hotel Palomar's Lustre Bar so it was time to try the Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails. A friend that lives in Downtown Phoenix invited me this morning for breakfast and I accepted. For me, it's always fun to head downtown for a bit of 'Metro' fun -- there's nothing like the noises of downtown City life. Back to BHK&C, I love the decor and that it's located in the hotel lobby. 

We decided to try the Brioche French Toast & Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Both were tasty and portions were just right. & Coffee was delish! Service was outstanding. I look forward to an evening Dinner here. Oh my...their Happy Hour fries would be ideal right about now! Cheers***"}
{"text":"Great new, hip spot in downtown Phoenix!  I was so excited when I heard a Hotel Palomar was coming and couldn't be happier with the way it turned out.  The atmosphere is hip, relaxing and just plain cool.  The bartenders/staff are very friendly and efficient.  The cocktail menu is extensive and I was not disappointed.  The summer smash was well made and very refreshing.  This will definitely be one of my \"go to\" places in my downtown neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of the place but the food was all very dissapointing. I brought my friend here for there birthday last week just before Thanksgiving. I'm not sure if the staff mentally checked out or the food is always so sloppily thrown together. For the prices this place charges I expect the best quality food prepared correctly. My scallops were overcooked and tasted like they had been frozen, unfrozen and sitting in a bag of water all day. The pork belly was tough and grissley. The hangar steak was burnt and had almost no meat on it, just char. The one thing that did come out good was the tator tots. 

Overall a dissapointment, do not come here, there are many better options especially for this price range!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem of a hotel lobby bar. I'm sure they hate being referred to as a lobby bar, but it is what it is. It's owned and operated by Kimpton, but with the atmosphere and offerings comparable to other successful gastro-lounges in the  Phoenix area, I think this place would also do well if it were a stand-alone operation. Come for a cocktail, or two, grab some 'gastropub tapas', and wash them down with another cocktail, or two. 

Service at the bar can take longer than you'd like, but understandably so. The mixologists aren't just shelling out drinks, but rather, handcrafting cocktails that fire on all cylinders--presentation, taste, and price. I love the bourbon-heavy menu, with the Lawless and Old Belle being my go-to cocktails. Yea, they're up there in price, but Old Fashioneds are $6 on the HH menu Mon-Fri.

As stated in most reviews, the Kimchi Pork Belly Sliders are pretty bomb! Most of their bar menu items can be ordered in different sizes as to promote sharing and sampling of more menu items, a definite plus. 

Unfortunately, I think the bartender told me the kitchen was closed when I was there on Sunday. I think I hit the lull between lunch and dinner service(3-5pm). It was definitely a bummer. Of course I don't know what your numbers look like, but I hope you have all the variables factored into your equations. I would've stayed and ordered another drink if I had food to go along with it. One drink alone would've covered an hour worth of kitchen labor. You should consider posting a sign that says,

\"We apologize to our patrons Sat-Sun 3-5pm, but our dreadful attempts at saving four hours of labor per week result in a disservice to our customers. We'd rather you eat and drink elsewhere.\"

All in all, 5 stars for the drinks and food (when I can get it). 1 star deducted for teasing me with a cocktail, and not pleasing me with food."}
{"text":"Have been there a couple of times for lunch and one for dinner.  Enjoy the vibe and the food.  Enjoy ordering several of the small plates and passing them around. Never knew I liked tater tots util I tried theirs,  My wife loved their sliders. Nice wine list with some good value wines.  Nice combination of great food and great atmosphere.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday party with an area that was reserved. The restaurant knew we were coming and expected a large cocktailing crowd. The problem was management only placed one cocktail server in this area and she was not well trained on service. We sat down and ordered a btl of wine, a beer, and two appetizers. The food arrived with no napkins or silverware. The bottle of wine arrived 15 mins after the food with no bucket of ice. The beer never arrived. I finally scolded the server and she brought a beer, but never brought out napkins, a manager never came and asked us if everything was ok, the food runner was the only person responsive. The food was ok but the service was pitiful! I ran several high end restaurants in NYC and would have been fired if I ran a restaurant like this place even for one night. If they do not get their act together it will be closed shortly! I won't go back!"}
{"text":"What a seat to watch the over 45 crowd head to the Van Halen concert! Yep, that's our generation doing shots of tequila with Coors Lite chasers. 

The conversational slur: 
What type of tequila you got? (we're quite picky)
Aw, never mind that's good (too drunk to care) 

So wow it was crowded with some drunks, cool folks and young'uns.  Bartenders maintained their cool with the escalating demands... Then normalcy returned with a pleasant jibe that allowed us to absorb this fun space within the Palomar.

Menu was reasonable but bar had the most options with unusual whiskeys, oversized rocks, and signature drinks without too much sugar. Ceviche enjoyable with well brined scallops, shrimp, and chili threads.

Guess the one nagging detail was how the bar treated a young man, under dressed but paying cash...geez they requested drink payment right away then they almost double charged him for the drink when he paid up for the later  entree. Meanwhile, we hadn't even offered a credit card for our honest tab. Can't figure out that one.

Loved the oversized rocks with the whiskey and nice pours. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I made reservations on Tuesday for Saturday night--  I had tickets to the ballet and wanted a downtown restaurant.  Blue Hound had great reviews and took reservations so I thought I would give it a try.  (Night before Valentine's Day so figured we needed reservations).  Someone called me on Friday to inform me that the chef decided to do a prix fixe menu ($80 for four courses) and that we couldn't order from the menu.  We were not interested and had to scramble to find another restaurant.  Poor planning on the part of the chef/staff.  Likely won't try again; plenty of other options."}
{"text":"I went to the bar for a cocktail before sitting for dinner with my husband. Michael was amazing, he was super knowledgable about drinks. I told him my favorite ingredients and he made me a fantastic custom drink, making me feel like a special guest. 

My great service continued after we sat at Nicolette's table. She walked us through the menu and made suggestions that we wouldn't have tried otherwise. She always had a smile and a welcoming attitude. We died when she brought us a complimentary chocolate cake at the end of dinner- WOW. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Blue Hound is a nice casual dining restaurant that is a mix of cute and rustic with all the screaming football, baseball and basketball fans coming in and out to watch TV and drink some drinks.  I dined here 2x on my trip and thought both times it was very mediocre.  The Brussels and the cauliflower apps were my two favorite things on the menu.  The Brussels were great, they were dressed with a Cesar dressing and parm cheese.  The brussels were cooked perfectly both nights.  I was very pleased with these... I really could had these for my main meal with something else small on the side.  The first night I had the scallops and they were pretty decent, I would say just nothing special.  The 2nd time around I had the seabass and it was incredibly fishy.  I am a FISH GIRL... so fishy doesn't bother me, however the seabass was just not cooked incredibly well and I didn't think the flavors came together.  I thought the atmosphere was nice.  The drinks were pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick drink and it was pretty good. It was a nice lounge feel with plenty of seating around for everyone. Bartenders were nice and the drinks were decent."}
{"text":"Located in The Palomar Hotel, The Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails is such a great place with a fabulous vibe and energy. The drinks are always on point and the apps are amazing! I have been here a few times and the happy hour is great.. BUT, get there early, as its tight! They do take reservations for dinner and I highly recommend since it's downtown and rather popular. 

My app loves:
The Deviled Eggs..Bacon and Jam.. YES.Please.
The Charcuterie Board...always different!
Fried Green Tomatoes with Lump Crab  SOOO tasty!
Shishito Peppers 

Great wine list and great mixology here.. sit at the bar and watch the masters mix the libations! This is just an all around great place for dinner; drinks; date night; whatever! Oh.. and I love the Blue Hound dog!"}
{"text":"I came into town for work and stayed at the Kimpton which is a great hotel. The blue Hound is part of the hotel. I ordered the pork shank and it came out looking amazing. Great presentation but when I took a bite it was so dry and had no real flavor. I couldn't even finish it. I had some of colleagues dishes and there's all tasted great."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. I came here on a work trip and all my colleagues enjoyed it. 

The fried catfish was excellent. My family is southern so I'm very picky when it comes to southern dishes & they hit the nail on the head. 

The martini was pretty good as well. I asked our server for something a little sweet but strong & that's exactly what it was. The majority of their signature drinks have bourbon in them so if that's what you like, you have plenty choices. 

The atmosphere is very nice & the view is pretty at night. The service was great & our server was very knowledgeable of the menu. 

Only reason I gave it 4 stars is it is pricey. Although my entree was great, it was not worth $25."}
{"text":"What a wonderful culinary treat!! I took the light rail to downtown for a show and was delighted the Blur Hound was steps away!! So location is awesome!  Great drink menu, decor and ambiance was beautiful and for this \"senior\" delighted I could actually carry on a conversation with my dinner partner. I started with the roasted asparagus that was topped with a fried egg - outstanding!! The dressing was light and flavorful!! Terrific appetizer. I had the chefs chopped salad for dinner and added shrimp. The portion was nice, not too huge and the ingredients were delicious - avocado, dried corn, frigola, green, fresh cherry tomatoes - all fresh, crisp and delicious. Our server was super helpful and friendly. I will go back again for sure. I highly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"I went to Blue Hound on a whim and had a good time.  Service was great, and the alcohol choices were excellent.  I sat at the bar like I normally do and enjoyed talking to the bar tender about the different whiskey options.  

I didn't eat anything, but the food looked good (although small portions) and a bit on the pricey side.

Either way, if you're in the mood for a quick drink, Blue Hound is a great place to stop."}
{"text":"Chris W was a fantastic waiter. The dude killed it. Would come back and ask for his service."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only.  Our bartender Bobby was great.  I put his skills to the test and ordered a lemondrop and a blood and sand (not on the drink menu). I hesitate to order them because they don't usually come out to my liking. Bobby didn't fail and the drinks were up to par! The hubby and I also ordered a few manhattans and the  the Lawless.  I'm not a smoker but the Lawless was just perfect.  Get it, you'll know what I mean.  If in Phoenix again, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went to the Blue Hound for a work happy hour birthday celebration.  To start, our server, also a bartender, when asked for a Manhattan with sweet vermouth, said quite sarcastically \"as opposed to...\"  I explained that I have had bartenders in the past make me a Manhattan with dry vermouth and I did not want that experience again.  To which he replied \"That is a Brooklyn\" and walked away.  OK giving him the benefit of the doubt, our drinks came and my Manhattan was very nice (everyone else drank wine and beer, so you can't really screw that up).  We ordered round two and those arrived and then decided to order some food.  And it's as if our server vanished.  Only he didn't.  He just stopped coming to our table and waited only on those around us.  Finally I went to the bar to try and get help and a bartender found a server to come to our table...while his colleague continued to avoid our table.  The food was so so (macaroni and cheese, sliders and wings).  The young lady who took over service duty was great.  But the die was cast.  This was a bad experience and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food looks good and the atmosphere is nice. I like their spin on traditional dishes. The cafe vita coffee was smooth and tasty. Unfortunately my food never showed up so after a 40 minute wait I just asked to cancel the order. Apparently the kitchen didn't notice the order so I figured instead of waiting another 20 minutes, I would simply go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I agree with some of my fellow Yelpers that have stated that this place still needs a little work.  I came here with 4 other people on a Saturday night and it was packed, which is always a good thing to see.  We got seated and glanced over the menu.  Our waiter came over and poured us water while we looked over the wine list.  His first mistake was that he didn't fill up our glasses of water all the way and didn't come back right away to refill the water glasses.

We ordered a bottle of wine and while we waited for it, the manager came over and told us that we would have to wait a little longer because they didn't have the particular wine we ordered chilled.  I guess that is not a big deal but we should have been asked if we wanted more water or a different kind of beverage.

We ordered some appetizers and still looked over the menu for our entrees.  The menu is not overly extensive and it really appeals to someone that likes to try new and inventive foods together. The tater tots we ordered were really good.  I would totally recommend that.  Finally our bottle of wine arrived after being chilled for about 15 minutes.

The dinner portions are really big.  I had the flat bread pizza, my sister had the sliders, and my bf had a fish dish.  The flavors were all really good.  Our waiter really didn't check up on us.  He maybe came over once in the entire time that we were in process from the appetizers to the entrees.  At this point we had ordered another bottle of wine and were enjoying the food and the conversation.  

We stayed a long time and also ordered dessert which we had to order from the manager because our original waiter was not anywhere to be seen.  The desserts were great but I would recommend to order one and share as it was enough to share with 4 people.

As we were ready to get our check, the waiter magically appeared and left us with our bill.  We had a $300 credit from an event we had held there earlier and our will was a little over $300.  The waiter acted like we were not going to live a tip based on the entire bill because he was hovering over us as we were paying the bill and stood there and looked at us until we got up to leave.  

All in all the food is good.  I think it is a place you can go once but it would not be on my list of places to return to.  I would definitely work on the service and make sure the waiters know what they are doing and make sure they are attentive.  The food can be the best but the service is what makes a customer want to return to have the delicious food."}
{"text":"One night I stop in for a couple drinks and some thing to eat. The food was really good and the best part of the night was the bartender Rob he  was very nice and the drinks were great He shore know how to make a drink. I will definitely be back at least you get a few drinks as long as Rob is the he really know how to make a customer feel welcome."}
{"text":"The chop salad was crazy good!  The trout was cooked perfect with a really smooth brown butter.  Excellent outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We came here before a Diamondbacks game for appetizers and drinks. It was great to see how many people were there before the game. It's nice that downtown is getting more action than just coming in and out for the game. 

We really enjoyed our food. Our server was very sweet. Look forward to going back"}
{"text":"Delicious. Our group shared the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes, both of which were terrific. I had the shrimp and grits for my meal which didn't disappoint. The portions were HUGE."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix is certainly in need of trendy restaurants like the Blue Hound. It has an industrial meets urban-chic-trendy type of atmosphere. There are chandeliers in cages, plank floors and rustic wood tables - and it all works nicely together. That said, there is nothing to help absorb sound so it can get quite loud quickly and difficult to carry on a conversation in a normal tone of voice.

The service was excellent so whatever kinks other reviewers have mentioned were certainly not apparent the evening we were there. Our servers was extremely knowledgable about the menu items, but also about the cocktails. She was attentive but didn't smother us, and she wanted to make sure we were happy with what we ordered.

Some have described the menu as \"southern\" cuisine, which I don't get. Just because there are grits on the menu doesn't make it southern. The menu is innovative and creative - perhaps a bit too much so. 

The food we had was good - but be prepared for very small portions overall, and fairly high prices. We started out with the pulled pork sliders on a white corn johnnycake. The pork was extremely flavorful but the johnnycake just wasn't substantial to support it. These sliders have to be eaten with a fork, and the pork fell off the johnnycake so it was difficult to get both the pork and cake in one bite. Entrees: the mac & cheese ($11) came in a very small cast iron cassoulet. Good, but more appetizer size than entree. Again, the portion size of the Alaskan Cod was small. Nicely presented, but it looked very lonely on the plate. The Plum Tomato flatbread was unispiring, lacking character and flavor. Very little basil. Steer clear of that option. The best entree was the Porterhouse Pork Chop. This was a good-sized portion, cooked perfectly and the confit was excellent. Desserts: the Sticky Toffee bread pudding with bacon ice cream was dry and not flavorful - very disappointing. The Carmelized Pineapple Upside Down cake was excellent.

The food was good - not outstanding - and high priced for the portion size. Great place for visitors to the Valley, and maybe business lunches. Glad we tried it but I doubt if we'll return. We just weren't that impressed."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of people.  Food was good, drinks were good, but service was SLLLOOOWWW!  I know we had a big group, but 45 minutes to get our salad and 3.5 hours for the full meal was a bit much!  They had a bunch of specialty cocktails that sounded interesting and others in the party were enjoying those, but scotch is my safe haven!  Nice relaxed atmosphere, but still an upscale joint!  If we didn't need the waiters, they may have gotten a 5-star rating!  If I find my way back to Phoenix again, I would probably pass and try other recommended restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for a going away dinner as he was leaving for vacation the same weekend, and I wanted to wow his pants off with somewhere we have not tried yet that would have different and fun ingredients. Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we ended up parking in the same garage as the restaurant so it worked out to our advantage that the other lot was full. 
Service was great, waiter was very polite, prompt and gave great suggestions.

The food was amazing! We had the Deviled Eggs, Tater Tots, and Risotto balls for apps. The smaller portion was perfect to taste, and not leave us too full. I ordered the scallops and he ordered the rib-eye. The rub on the rib-eye was amazing, and the scallops melted in your mouth. 

I will defiantly be back here with him to try other menu items! I made reservations at 9 on a Saturday, and there was barely anyone in the dining area so I don't feel the need to do that again."}
{"text":"WARNING their drink menu has changed!!! If you like playing cocktail roulette or If you like picking your craft cocktails from a picture book, this is your new place! The new cocktail menu is ludacris! It has nice pictures of cocktails with numbers that lead you to a blurb that gives no description on what the drink is besides what city it was created in and by who. This sadly leaves you having a 20 minute discussion with your waiter/waitress on why and how this menu works and sadly enough they don't have all 40 some cocktails memorized so you get some diluted version of the ingredients with a lot of \"ummms\" and \"wellsssss\". Like most, I would assume we like to have some knowledge of what we are drinking rather than \"oh that looks nice in a picture and we call it Lion King and it's from Phoenix, created by a guy named Jake...I'm sure he's a great guy....\" I would assume that most of us go out looking to enjoy a nice cocktail and chat with our company not the wait staff who is  trying to depict a menu. This used to be our go to place for nice cocktails and food... It was also our go to place for our out of town guests. It is always the first place we have in mind to go. Blue hound has amazing food and cocktails. They just seem to be a little confused right now. Not sure if I will be going back until the cocktails are back in order. This is business suicide and Also!... Bring back the \"lawless\"! How do you take the best drink off a menu? Sad..."}
{"text":"Can't review because I wasn't able to get acknowledged or served in an empty bar. \" hello I'll be right with you\" customer service tip of the day."}
{"text":"I came to dinner  here  to celebrate my 33 year anniversary, unfortunately it was not a very good dining experience.  

The first mistake was the confusion of this restaurant and its theme.   When I asked the waiter what the theme is ,he said it was like ordering Spanish tapa's a little bit of everything .. but when you look at menu I didn't see how that was possible... but ok.
I was given a drink menu,  I was impressed with it.. but I'm more of a traditional mixed drink person. So I figured they must have a great bar service or fantastic bar tenders .   I ordered a Manhattan straight which just means without the ice.   Well somehow they got confused how to serve it  as I watching them they were pouring the drink  into a on the rocks glass so naturally it doesn't fill the glass because it's without the ice.. It was the funniest thing to watch .    So the waiter comes over with a look of concern and tells me they would like to serve it with the large ice cubes they offer.. at that point I just accepted the drink that way.. but all they needed to do was to serve it in a martini glass.   Now for my wife's drinks...    She orders a margerita  with a agave syrup the drink comes and it tasted sour no hint of agave  she sends it back.. she orders a plain Gin and tonic.. drink comes and guess what the tonic was flat..   so at 10 dollars a drink or more .. I would have expected something  extra ordinary instead we got something that you would order at your local gin mill.

Ordered the flatbread as an appetizer  it was really good so I figured ok let's forget about the drink fiasco..  Main course  Blacken sea bass.. It was good but filled with too many bones I had to pick at the fish with my hands so that I would not swallow  the bones.   My wife ordered the lamb meatballs she liked them and so did I  but not worth the price.

So what did like about this place..   our waiter was very good, the manager came over and bought us dessert because of the drinks fiasco, beautiful urban style setting.    Would I come back?  probably not.."}
{"text":"I give them 5 starts for follow up! I've been here a few times, lunch,  dinner, drinks. .. Can't say the experience is consistent. Sometimes is great, others just OK,  and sporadically amazing. But,  I have to say the manager is fantastic. After waiting to be seated for our reservation for a while my family and I ended up leaving.  It was raining and we were cutting it short on time for the Paul McCartney concert. No big deal, it happens. But I was surprised to get a call the next day from the manager!! Talk about going the extra mile. .. She apologized,  I said no worries,  I thought that was it. But she said to come for drinks on her, that they would have my name saved for whenever I came back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch at Blue Hound today! The Spanish Omelet was absolutely fabulous and out service by James was near perfect! Going back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant. Definitely try the brussel sprouts. Shrimp & grits we're excellent. Hope to come back again."}
{"text":"Great place if money isn't an issue. You get what you pay for and it's pricey. A nice place for dinner downtown and a great atmosphere. Plenty of seats for large groups and it's connected to the hotel. Parking isn't easy, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear we were coming back here for my birthday again. I was happy they got us in early, but i can now understand why they weren't busy. 

The food and the atmosphere did not live up to the memory. The vibe is home and the food was OK at best. Definitely no longer worth the expense. Sorry to say this may be my last trip to the hound."}
{"text":"Terrible.  shrimp small and not peeled or de headed. I came to eat not to catch and clean.   Drinks are small and way over priced.   Food did come out fast and restaurant looks nice"}
{"text":"DOG Gone it the meal was PAWS-itively filled with unexpected surprises and masterful execution. It was something to YELP about.

You will BARK about having a great meal here if you share a bunch of small plates. Many of the plates come in small or regular sizes. The prices are very reasonable with one of the small plates starting at just $3.

We started with these really great Sazerac CockTAILS. They were so good we couldn't help not to LAP them up. It was outstanding and a very strong $10. drink.

Who doesn't like to WOLF down Blistered Miso Shishito Peppers and a small size Small Family Farmed Cheese Plate served at the perfect eating temperature with very tasty house made saltines.

The Elote Style Corn was so fresh and was something to HOWEL about. The corn tasted like fresh corn you'd get from a farmers market and found out if did come from local McClendons Farm.

Another TAIL WAGGER is the Jerk Cured Scottish Salmon. The flavor of the potato complemented the jerk seasoning with the salmon that was truly unique.

The Kimchi Pork Belly Siders might give some people a new LEASH on life. They make you a little nuts because they have peanuts on them.

We ended the meal sharing one Massive BBQ'd Beef Rib over Blue Cheese Grits. I feel like a HEAL saying this but it didn't say on the menu that it would be topped with a pickle fruit. It came out with pickled peached and I didn't mean to pick a BONE with anyone but we had to send it back since my husband has a peach allergy. LICK-ity split the Chef sent out another and graciously apologized for not noting that on the menu. The Short Rib really was the most MASTER-ful Rib I ever had anywhere. Not only was it caramelized meaty and succulent. it also had this chewy leather meaty coating around it that was awesome with those great BBQ smokey flavors. I usually don't eat ribs because they are too fatty for me as this one was in places for me and I note for other people it might be too fatty but for some people this is bliss and what they are looking for. The top or curved part of the rib is the less fatty part and I could eat from there and what I ate from there I really enjoyed and can appreciate how good it really was. The Blue Cheese grits really went well with the rib and were really great.
It's a shame I had to pass on the picked peaches.

I felt like CHASING the waiter down for one of those interesting desserts that they have here but when he presented the dessert menu I just had to MUTT-er I was too full to cram in dessert and had to take a WALK.

I don't mean to be a little RUFF but Blue Hound Kitchen and CockTAILs might leave you STAY Hot under the COLLAR in a Good Way.

1-15-2015 Chef has changed since my visit."}
{"text":"Great little spot for cocktails and small plates!  I didn't stay for dinner, but next time I will definitely give this place a try.  The menu looks great, and I suspect they are accommodating when it comes to dietary needs."}
{"text":"I Love this place for food, fun, cocktails! Its just a happening kind of a place with beautiful people"}
{"text":"The blended burger was the Best I have ever had!  Very tasty and moist!! YUM!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I read the reviews from the other Yelpers about this restaurants.  When I arrived I was really impressed with how nice it looked.  The bar isn't large or the restaurant in general isn't that big,  but it seems pretty lively.    Nice big windows which are probably really nice to sit next to on a Friday and Saturday night when there are people out and about.
We were greeted graciously by the hostess and seated quickly.  Our server was also very nice.  We ordered the tater tots, just a half order.  I loved those and the half order was more than enough for my husband and I to share.  Then we  had the sopes.  I love pork belly, so was really excited about trying them.  They were a little on the heavy side.  Next we tried the biscuits.  If you like bacon and eggs, then you will like this dish.  I feel like the quail eggs were a little overcooked.  We decided to share the Short Rib.  It was huge!  I was really excited to try the grits that came with it too.  But then we bit into it.  It was pure fat!  I don't mind a little fat if it rendered properly, but it wasn't.  So my husband cuts on the other side of the rib and we still couldn't find any actual meat.  Not that it mattered since biting into the fat already turned my stomach.  The server offered to cook it longer or bring another, but we had lost our appetite.  When the server brought us the bill he said that the manager took 10% off the top of our tab, which was about $3.50.  That's not going to work.  We asked to speak to the manager and when he came to speak to us he removed the short rib off our tab.
I think this place is going to be great in a couple of months.  The menu is pretty creative and I would like to return and try some other dishes one day.  Great place to go if you like bacon, which I do.  Next time I will probably try the crudo dish or a salad.  I little acid would go great with the heavier dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday. Now, for a birthday dinner, a girl can only hope that her recommendation would suffice. This restaurant was above and beyond what I'd hoped for, and totally made the night. 

Our waitress was Shaura, and was totally sweet. She was super knowledgable of the menu and drinks menu. The atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for; a little modern, a little urban, and a little rustic, all in one. It's located in the Hotel Palomar's lobby, and a bit difficult to find, but doesn't affect the restaurant's awesomeness. 

For an appetizer we had the Tater Tots (DO IT), and I ended up using the sauce to dip everything else in later.. an amazing blend of european spices and tomatoes and peppers. Awesome. 

My boyfriend had the Pork in Belly. Sounds weird, but he downed the entire thing. AND had dessert. But more on that later. It was super tender and I could smell its deliciousness from across the table. I had the Heirloom Prosciutto, which was REALLY good. Heirloom Prosciutto, I learned, is really rare, and was most likely the best I've ever had. It had pesto and pistachio, which made it super unique. 

Shaura helped me plan a special birthday surprise dessert for my man, and the entire staff even signed a birthday card for him! The dessert might have been the best part, It was toffee cake with BACON ice cream and carmel on top. Yes, BACON ice cream. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Green Fried Tomatoes with crab and a remoulade was pleasant. It was gratis as we were looking for the dinner items that we saw on \"Check Please\". It could be a meal for a light eater. I also had the crab cake with a salad. The salad with the champaign vinaigrette was very nice, too.The fries that go with the burger were made from a whole potato and were tasty. We also had, as gratis for coming down after seeing the Blue Hound on \"Check Please\" , the corn grit fries weren't to my liking even though they came with a dipping tomato sauce. I have to add that I don't like grits! I will be back at Christmas time with a friend for dinner to see the lights and skating pond outside!I"}
{"text":"Phoenix, you \"speak-easy\" our language! This was our second and final \"sip and nosh\" place for the evening. I knew I wanted to try this place out so I purposely told hubby to save room for our next small plate dinner. I couldn't quite tell from the photos what kind of food it offered but figured we would find something to fill our bellies. 

Let me start off by saying the name (Blue Hound Kitchen) doesn't do justice to its classy, posh, swanky, speakeasy like, cozy bar/restaurant. I mean, yeah I applaud the Blue Hounds which greet patrons here and there (pictures are a must!) but the place is so much more than that! 
Lucky for us, it was a Sunday night and we had no problems walking (I mean sauntering) in to a nearly open seat bar. I can imagine on a weeknight it would be packed with the downtowners loosening the tie and tossing back some cocktails after work. 

We truly enjoy watching our bartenders work their magic while crafting cocktails. Hubby enjoyed the Lawless cocktail ($13) finished off with a tobacco smoke. I opted for the Air Mail ($12) which was light and refreshing. As I gazed over the menu, I immediately spied the Corn Grit Fries (how can anyone resist smoked bacon, white cheddar and Pomodoro sauce) and hubby picked the Deviled Eggs. I must have been hiding under a rock when deviled eggs became a huge appetizer. Even though we just had them at our last restaurant, they never taste the same no matter where you go! These were good but not raving over them. Those Grit Fries are what we raved over. So interesting and awesome. Definitely recommend!

We left happy and blue. Happy, we had a great time but a bit blue that our time in Phoenix was too short. Definitely would like to explore more of this place (and city) next time we're here! It's no joke that Phoenix is HOT, HOT, HOT...temperature and dining/bar scene!"}
{"text":"Such a lovely experience! We had some fantastic recommendations from our waiter, Ryan, who not only directed me to an absolutely perfect summer cocktail (Lost Melody), but was able to arrange for an elderberry cocktail for my friend that wasn't on the menu. The appetizers were delightful - we had the cheese plate and grit fries, which were divine - and the entrees were flavorful with perfect portions. I chose the daily flatbread with cauliflower on the side, and the flatbread was perfect; the cauliflower could have had a bit more of a kick, but that's my only quibble for an otherwise stellar dining experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the dinner menu, but the lunch is great! I can not order the the Cobb salad, it's very refreshing. We live in the cityscape residences and Blue Hound provides our room service. I'd say the room service is mediocre but the restaurant is great. The drinks are expensive but there's a lot of thought in each one & mixology is a craft."}
{"text":"Over priced, food was not anything special, bad service.

Does have good atomosphere, that is about it"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has 3 1/2 stars average.  We stayed at the Palomar hotel for the second time and last time we stayed, we ate quickly on our way to the comedy club across the street.  The hush puppies, tater tots and pineapple upside down cake made an impression.  This time, we chose to do the chef's tasting menu.  They serve four courses with two paired drinks.  All four courses were stellar and we are pretty discerning diners.  Our only complaint is that we didn't get a glass of wine as one of our drinks.  We were served two very interesting cocktails, but the second was like straight bourbon.  We would have enjoyed a nice glass of wine with dinner.  Ryan was an awesome server!  We will be back."}
{"text":"We ate here for a big team dinner this week. There were twelve of us and we sat outside on the patio which is delightful. It was a chilly evening, but they moved all kinds of heaters around our table to make everyone comfortable. 

First up....It's hard to find the door! Our Uber driver dropped us off at the address and we were like...where is it?? You have to walk up the large cement stairs and then you'll see the cool neon blue dog sign. Inside - it's gorgeous! COOOOOL bar area with these neat hanging lights. Great place for a date!! LOVE the vibe. 

The drinks are awesome! I tried the Hibiscus Belle Fleur drink and it came with a beautiful flower in the glass. So fun, and so tasty. Kind of sweet, but not overly so. Everyone at the table loved their cocktails. It seems like they are all worth trying. 

We shared almost every single appetizer so we could try different things. Everyone freaked out about the deviled eggs! They have bacon jam at the bottom. Wowza. My favorite two appetizers were the flatbread and the sunchokes. But everything was great. I think it would be fine to just have a bunch of apps for dinner - they are that good. 

Someone in my party was craving the hamburger from the website photo... Turned out they ran out at lunch time! So no burgers at dinner. 

I had the roasted chicken as my entree. I received two chicken pieces, still on the bone. Very juicy and well seasoned. There was a lot of quinoa on my plate. i was wishing there was more butternut puree or more veggies. It was a good meal. 

I recommend this place for sure. Good for groups and also good for dates. It's not a place for kids - very adult vibe. I would come back if I'm in Phoenix visiting again."}
{"text":"Excellent food service and a real easy place to get to downtown. Great shrimp and grits. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came to eat here based on the menu. I didn't realize it was a Kimpton restaurant, attached to the Palomar hotel. I'm a fan of Kimpton hotels, so I was delighted to learn it was one of their restaurants. The place is really cool - it's got a 20s speakeasy - library lounge type of look to it. The bartenders are even dressed the part. 

I didn't have drinks here, just food. This place is like a gastropub, so everything on the menu sounded amazing. I ordered the deviled eggs, the tater tots, and the tagliatelle. The deviled eggs were all right - there was bacon mixed in with the yolk. Not the best deviled eggs I've ever had. The tater tots were good - they also had bacon inside and the inside had a very hash browny texture. It came with a dipping sauce, but that tasted weird. The tagliatelle pasta had roasted squash, wild mushrooms, in the sauce was a walnut pesto. It sounded amazing on paper, but this tasted really weird. And there was too much sauce that overpowered the pasta noodles and the squash and the mushrooms. I didn't really like it and wouldn't order it again. 

Overall the food was just okay - it didn't amaze me. The food sounded good in theory on paper, and the presentation was really nice, but the taste and quality weren't enough to make me want to return. The service was good though. The hostess was really nice and friendly. The bartenders were adequate. And the food came out quickly. The best part of this place is the look of the interior."}
{"text":"The food is spectacular! Came here the first time in 2014. Going back to AZ this weekend for a getaway and definitely planning on stopping in for lunch. Super excited for the roasted corn."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and Chris W. was a fantastic waiter, not to mention easy on the eyes...... for these two Texas girls looking for a local eatery! The cheese plate, fried green toatoes, and salad that we split were awesome!  Finally also, a place that makes a good dirty martini. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Cocktails were great. Service was fantastic. Attentive but not bothersome. Appetizers were exceptional. 

For cocktails we started with and old fashioned and the margarita tropical. Both were exceptional. 

We ordered appetizers. The flat bread and the pork belly sliders. Both were outstanding. I highly recommend the sliders. I wouldn't come back here without ordering them. 

We passed on ordering an entrée because they were a little pricey. Probably the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars. 

The atmosphere is great for a date night or a night out. 

If you like a strong original whiskey drink, get the lawless."}
{"text":"We, three, arrived at BHKC late on a Friday for happy hour but left within the hour. So much for the hype!  Maybe because the stars weren't aligned right, but it was not the place for us to sit and sip that night.  Many rave about the Lawless drink, let's just say that if you're a flowery flavored drinker, don't go for it.  The menu was so limited and there wasn't a dish on there that I wanted to shell out a chunk of dollars for.  Like I said, perhaps it just wasn't our night to relish in the BHKC experience."}
{"text":"Had heirloom tomatoes with grilled swordfish, shishito peppers and the bourbon smash, and that was the best meal I've had during my entire stay in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Last night was my third time here. We decided to meet friends here while waiting for a table across the street at Bitter and Twisted. It would be an hour wait they said to get a table at Bitter and Twisted so I thought that should be more than enough time to pre-drink at Blue Hound. 
45 minutes after waiting, someone finally takes our drink order. Then, about 20 minutes later we get our drinks just in time for our table to be ready across the street. So, our group of 5 had to chug our cocktails, which were mostly beers and a whiskey diet for me and a vodka tonic for a friend (so easy cocktails), and pay right away to make it in time. 

My 2nd time there was before a concert. My hubs and I decided to get dinner with drinks beforehand. Food was delicious. We really enjoyed the pork belly. Deviled eggs also a treat. BUT... After ordering my first drink, I asked if I could keep the cocktail menu a bit longer. The waiter looked stressed and said, \"We only have a few of these cocktail menus\" wanting to take it from me. I didn't know how to respond. I just looked at him. He then left the menu with me anyway, and when he came back, I gave the menu back to him and said that I had taken pics of the drink menu so he could have the menu back. 
Awkward, right? Perhaps I was out of line just to keep the drink menu longer but I was excited to see what to order next since the cocktails are good here. 

That first time here? Oh, we didn't have reservations so we didn't get a table. Understandable on a Sunday night.. We ended up seating at a table thinking that it was part of the bar area and not the restaurant. It looks like a family size round table but \"outside\" of the regular restaurant side. It's on the outside of a ceiling to floor divider. 30 minutes later, the hostess said we couldn't sit there because it's part of the restaurant. That's why we weren't able to order anything, so we walked over to Copper Blues..."}
{"text":"Excellent service, drinks and food overall!!  Ribs were way too salty, but the staff took good care of me and recommended 2 other apps which were awesome!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here by recommendation of Royce K. The hostess was on the phone and did not acknowledge us, but Nicolette stopped by and noticed it, she offered to assist us and answered our questions. We were specifically looking for a ribeye, and they did not have any, so we left. We were looking for a place within walking distance of Hilton Garden Inn Downtown.
We did not find a good option for ribeye, but since Nicolette had mentioned a New York strip special they had, we decided to go back. 
(I quickly made a reservation through my phone and we were seated right away, earlier we had been told the main dining area was quite busy and we were encouraged to sit at the bar, but with the reservation we were able to sit at the dining area... In a very weird corner and they were not even busy)
As it turns out Nicolette was our server and she took really good care of us, from the brief interaction earlier we already knew she was going to be great.
Hubby had a Long Island Iced Tea that was served in a super skinny tall glass with of course big ice cubes, so the portion was very small (not so happy about that detail), but then our dinner arrived and it was amazing. Hubby had the flat iron steak and he enjoyed it very much, I had the New York strip special and it was delicious. I had asked Nicolette to request a very fatty cut and it was just what I was needing (I am doing pseudo keto diet and had a marathon to run the next day).
My steak came with loaded mashed potatoes (hubby enjoyed those), green beans, and some sort of squash, I asked for extra butter for the green beans and everything was delicious. 
Hubby had the pineapple upside down for dessert, it came with pineapple gelato, I had a microscopic sample of each and it was good, the gelato was very tasty without being overly sweet.
Over all a very good experience."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed, waste of $90. My wife and I had been to Blue Hound the first few years when it opened and loved the BBQ ribs, deviled eggs and drinks. We planned to have a nice night out again and eat some of the traditional plates we had but they changed the menu and sadly disappointed in the portion sizes, lack of creativity and flavor of and in the food. 

To begin the deviled eggs were nothing compared to the ones at Del Friscos. Lacked flavor and taste. My wife had the Swordfish which was good, and I had the Neiman Short Ribs - bad decision - it was mainly thin flat meat with fat and tasted bathed in salt.  When I told the waiter he looked at me as though I didn't know meat had salt and said they were \"salt friendly\" as though I would have changed my mind.  The manager walked over shortly after and asked how the sharing of our first dish was going instead of apologizing and asking if there was anything they could do to make the experience better. 

When the next dish was brought out, Trout, it too tasted over salted but as I was too hungry I ate it and just wanted to call it a night. 

I WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"It's always a treat to visit Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails, whether you're feasting on innovative creations by Chef Stephen Jones, who pours love into every dish, or sipping on one of the delicious handcrafted cocktails for happy hour. I was invited to try some of the newest offerings on Jones' current spring/summer menu, made with organic and locally sourced ingredients that perfectly complement each other for a symphony in your mouth.

This meal (thank you to J. Lauren PR for the invitation), my pal Elle and I grabbed a seat outside on the patio, overlooking CityScape in downtown Phoenix.

Not only was the weather perfect, we could hear tunes from neighboring Copper Blues. Like Elle pointed out, the music was great because it provided great background melodies that allowed us to still hear what each other was saying.

Like all my visits at Blue Hound, the service, from the hostess to every single server who visited our table (including the knowledgeable and friendly Justis), was top-notch. Kudos to Blue Hound for properly training their staff in menu proficiency and professionalism.

We started with two delicious drinks - the Singapore Sling ($10) was made with Arizona Distilling Co. gin, Bénédictine, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and Cherry Heering liqueur. Justis told us the drink is modeled after original Tiki drinks, and we both agreed the balance of sweet and sour was great

I also got the Lost Melody ($10), a frothy concoction with Smirnoff vodka, grapefruit liquer, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, and rose flower water. It tasted like dessert in a drink, which was totally fine with me, and I loved inhaling the coconut scents with every tasty sip.

My pal and I split a ton of plates, perfectly portioned for sharing, during our feast. First up was the Cured Strawberry and Fennel Flatbread ($14), with pickeled fennel (a favorite ingredient of Chef Jones - read my Phoenix People interview with him here), pistachio, wild baby arugula and ricotta cheese. I've never had strawberries on a pizza, but let me tell you, the flatbread was delicious and tasted just like what you'd think of when it comes to spring.

We also dug into the Avocado salad ($9), with blood oranges, grapefruit and wild greens. Elle described it perfectly as \"chic diet food,'\" a light and fresh salad you could feel good eating right before a night out or before getting into a swimsuit, since it was healthy and light. I loved the fruit and avocado combination and gobbled up every bite.

Elle loved the Tater Tots she ordered (a small portion at $7), which had bacon and chive made right in the tots. \"These are every college kid's wet dream,\" she said, noting the bacon baked in was a spectacular touch.

We both enjoyed the Corn Bread Panzanella ($9), a bread salad with artichoke, fava beans, baby leeks, and peas mixed with an herb vinaigrette. It was really filing and would be a great appetizer to share.

Surprisingly, maybe our favorite savory dish was the Roasted Cauliflower ($9), really simple but oh-so-good because, like most of Blue Hound's offerings, it combined sweet, savory and salty to satisfy all your palate's tastes. It came with pistachios, capers and currants, and Justis said it's simply cooked by poaching the cruciferous vegetable in milk before charring it a little in a skillet, then adding in the capers, currants and a touch of butter and herbs.

Elle summed up the meal perfectly: \"I would never have thought of putting this stuff together, but it's exactly what I want,\" she said.

I was full, but we asked Justis to surprise us with dessert. He brought out the latest dessert menu item, the BHPB&J ($9), a twist on PB&J with whoopie pie, blackberry jelly ice cream, peanut butter mousse (OMG, so good), and fresh berries. The chocolate covering the whooiee pie was so decadent, and I loved all the flavors on the updated classic. \"It tastes like the Fourth of July,\" Elle added, saying it reminded her of all-American flavors from the summer holiday.

We were stuffed, but then were surprised with dessert number two: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake served skillet-style ($9), wish medjool date ice cream atop salted caramel.

We devoured every bite despite our full bellies, and every serving was a winner for these two ladies.

While most of what we ordered was vegetarian, Blue Hound's latest menu has some notable seafood items, including Crispy Salt N' Pepper Shrimp, Grilled Yellowfin Tuna and Red Snapper."}
{"text":"We went to the Blue Hound during Phoenix's Mardi Gras festival. Surprisingly the bar area was practically empty. There was a wedding party of approximately 8 people getting their picture taken at the bar while lifting champagne flutes but other than that the place was empty. Two bartenders were at the bar, I won't say working the bar as every open space at the bar (all seats except where the wedding party was) was cluttered with detritus from the previous patron and the bartenders were not doing anything but chatting with the wedding party. We stood at the bar (no one near us for ten feet to a side) yet were firmly ignored for 5 minutes. I guess they must have a different revenue stream than customers as they sure lost two that day. We went to Tom's Tavern across the street and had some great cocktails. I understand difficulty in getting service at a crowded bar, but come on, two customers at an empty bar and you never even greet them..."}
{"text":"Interesting menu. Drinks way over priced. Bone in pork belly was ok. Not enough to eat $12 vodka.  Would go back to try something else
 H"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the ingenious cocktails they craft at Blue Hound. They are some of the most delicious and inventive drinks I've ever tasted. A must for any night out downtown."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant I just had cocktails and a appetizer.  
Great ambience  casual and cool!  Great energetic servers was refreshing!  Thanks  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in here the other night with my wife to watch one of the World Series games. Didn't really come in to eat we just at at the bar. Bartender was a pretty cool guy and we ordered a few drinks. Old fashioned was really good and it was one of my wife's favorite drinks she's ever had. Then the bartender made a speciality drink with bourbon in it and that was my fav of the night. Beer was just okay. Last drink that we got was some coconut drink? It was not very good at all and we ordered it because it looked really cool. Looks can be deceiving. We stayed for quite a while so we ended up getting an order of fries with the sriracha aioli. They were pretty good fires and the aioli was delish. Would like to come back and try more food items on the menu. Kinda strange how they only have 1 TV though it seems like it would be a nice place to watch a game but their is only 1 TV so that makes it not as enjoyable to watch sports. Other than that, cool restaurant and I would return for sure."}
{"text":"Went here twice, during a 3-day trip.
From other Yelpers, seems like the place for cocktails.

Round 1 - Thursday night after 8p dinner:

Food:
1. roasted chicken - a little dry but big portions; 
2. paparadelle with meat sauce - salty but good texture in the pasta. 

Drinks: 
1. lawless - amazing with when the tobacco-smoked glass! If you like bourbon, this is a must try.
2. old fashioned - nice use of the big orange rind, gave it a deeper taste.

Round 2 - Saturday night after 7p, drinks only at the bar: same drinks as above! Thanks for a great last drink in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food was certainly good. I really like the South meets Southwest concept. The dining room and bar are pretty small, so the atmosphere is lively even if there are only a few tables occupied and a few guests at the bar. I think its a really good idea to offer most dishes in a small or standard size - perfect for sharing and portion control. 

The service is still a work in progress, I believe. Its a new restaurant, so its still getting into the swing of things. 

We saw Chef Stephen Jones working in the kitchen and I thought that it was cool that he was there personally overseeing the kitchen. 

We tried the highly recommended Kentucky Fried Quail and the Tater-tots. The quail was delicious! But all of the accompaniment were a little bland I thought. 

Overall the food was innovative and delicious- but somehow a little less than what I expected from \"one of the best new restaurants in Phoenix.\""}
{"text":"Loved this place. We used open table to reserve a table for two and got a nice private one with a view. Everyone was so friendly. Loved the appetizers of fried green tomatoes with crabmeat and the deviled eggs with bacon jam. The handcrafted cocktails were amazing and a great compliment to the meal. I enjoyed the flat iron and my nephew had the pappardelle. We were too stuffed for dessert but they sounded very satisfying. This was a great way to cap off our amazing Arizona vacation!"}
{"text":"The Chef here is amazing, food perfect, service awesome, the bbg mesquite was perfect, the shishito peppers with the miso to die for. Chef came out to speak with me, going to come for dinner, try out some steak.sine of the sweet corn soup."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Great location as we were here for a baseball game in walking distance from Chase Stadium. The drinks were delicious thanks to the mixologist Noah and our server Daniel...well he took the the cake. Not only did he have the best recommendations for food but he was hilarious. He is what customer service is all about! Definitely recommend this place to everyone and ask for Daniels as you server, although I'm sure they are all good! Class act all the way!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I stopped in for drinks before the Phoenix Mercury game the other night. Rob and Michael were super helpful, answering all of our stupid questions regarding the cocktails even though it was pretty busy in there. We got well lubricated on this yummy vodka drink - \"Lost Melody\" I believe it was called. We didn't try any food, but I definitely recommend coming here for drinks, the bartenders are awesome!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cocktail (Special K), an appetizer (deviled eggs), and an entree (shrimp and grits).  The cocktail was fantastic!  The deviled eggs were good... I noticed they tasted a bit salty when taking multiple bites, but the balance is perfect if you eat them in one bite.  I was a little disappointed in the shrimp and grits, just because it was so rich.  It smelled overwhelmingly of butter.  I mean, it was delicious, but too heavy.  The service was great too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in the Palomar hotel and a bit difficult to see from the street.  They offer validation for 2 hours of parking in the public parking which is helpful.  The location is downtown and close to the Comerica Theater which is where we were going after dinner.   I had the iceberg salad which was very good.  For the entree I had the Arctic Char which was good but not great.  From watching the surrounding tables, it appeared that the happy hour appetizers might have been the way to go.  They have outdoor seating with a fireplace which would be nice when the weather is cooler.  It's convenient in the downtown area but not particularly special."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my lawyer and it was absolutely delicious. The shishito peppers were amazing they just melted in your mouth. Oh and the view was so beautiful. We had the chocolate cake for dessert and it was so savory and sweet could not complain would go back any time and the staff was friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for the Cactus Bowl.  This was within walking distance of our hotel and also it was open on Christmas day.  Made reservations.  This is a pretty nice hotel located downtown near all the sports venues.  The menu had a variety of options.  I ordered the fried catfish with shrimp. It was delicious!  My son had the roasted chicken.  His was very moist and tasty.  My catfish was cooked perfectly and the shrimp and sauce was absolutely amazing!  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night dinner and some cocktails with friends! The location was great the ambiance was very nice and the food was delicious.  We couldn't sit outside cause it was pretty windy but there's a nice view of the city on the patio and it's good for people watching. I had the Brussel sprouts and the were fantastic, my bf had the shrimp and grits as recommended by our server since the chef specializes in Cajun and he really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The cocktail menu and HH food are divine.  Now that downtown finally feels like, oh you know a downtown, we needed a new place to hang out other than the butcher and hanny's.  Blue Hound has a great GM, a great mixologist and helpful staff.  They have the classics libations as well as reimagined ones, some even involving scotch.  The lunch specials are enough to put you into a food coma, I will say that dinner here can be challenging if your friends don't like to share food or are looking for more traditional fare.  (I do think they are a little heavy handed with the salt though).  Overall, I'm basically living here and should set up a little office in the corner next to the big community table.  In fact, I just gave myself an idea.
Favorite things to eat:  Flatbreads, the caramel corn, the falafal bites, anything on the lunch menu.
To drink:  The new Hemingway, the new Cuban, anything with bourbon or scotch in it.
It is a weird mix of suits and hipsters.  The upstairs bar is less suity though."}
{"text":"The best happy hour in downtown Phoenix.  The cocktails are delicious, the staff is eye candy, the crowd is... a little stuck up at times but that's their problem, not mine.  My Friday night's usually start here and end at Hanny's for dinner and that is the recipe for a perfect end to a work week."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a bit shocked with all the rave reviews.  Are you all just so stoked that there's a hip new restaurant/bar in downtown?  For all you non-guests of Blue Hound, don't get all wet yet - here's the truth:

Drinks - happy hour is pretty decent I had the Summer Smash at it was tasty!  Loved it.

Food - Terrible!  My friend and I just got off work at 5:30 and were planning to head over to the Herberger Theatre for a 7:30 show.  We were hungry and excited to try a new spot.  Out of the recommendation of our waiter, we decided to have a few starters and share an entree.  Our waiter highly recommended the Tater Tots & Sopes.  The Taters are deep fried tots mixed with bacon and chive.  They were a bit salty and not as good as they sounded.  The Sopes were just terrible.  Imagine rubbery silver dollar sized Sopes with the worst tasting pork.  One bite is all it took and I wanted to vomit.  Onto the entree.  We decided to share the Mussels which took about 40 minutes to arrive at our table (no the waiter didn't mention how long it would take even though he knew we were planning to catch a show).  They were \"ok\", not out of this world.  It came with what was once toasted bread but I think when the toast is black, it's beyond toast, right?  Not impressed.

We left hungry and barely made it to our show at the Herberger.  Good news is the Herberger was serving up the most divine brownies that saved the evening! 

The moral of this story is don't go hungry.  Food sucks but happy hour is pretty decent. It's perfect if you want to chill-lax with colleagues or friends."}
{"text":"Visited here for dinner with a friend on a Friday evening in October and had a really nice time. We decided to sit at the bar because it is a nice, vintage style bar with a modern twist and has a view of the courtyard in this complex downtown. 

Good drinks and well prepared, fresh, food with unique twists would describe this place best.

The drinks were stiff and tasty. There are many gin and bourbon based cocktails. The atmosphere is trendy with large open windows and high ceilings. The caesar brussels sprout salad was really tasty and fresh as were the fish tacos which had mango and a good amount of spice. The tater tots were also great and unique; almost like a stuffed potato. The menu is trendy and has tapas-style offerings, yet it's unique, and all of the food was very flavorful. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here originally after reading reviews on yelp and saw the crowd because of the final four and thought we would try something else. Nothing in the area matched the decor and menu.

Lost Boy Scout was incredible with a warm roasted marshmallow on top.

Daily flatbread was a margarita style with a simple yet delicious flavor.

Our server was delightful. No complaints here.

When our check was delivered it was on top of a journal sharing our guest experiences. Unique and personal touch!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our third time eating here. Food is amazing. Everything on the menu is superb and unique. Service is always great. Highly recommend. Only suggestion is blue cheese olives for Martinis."}
{"text":"I was really excited to find an Oyster po'boy downtown. However, I was really disappointed by the po'boy. The bread tasted like the burnt flat top, the oysters were soggy and not cleaned and the remoulade was not very flavorful. The fries were overpowered by the rosemary and parmesan. Overall, everything was a greasy soggy mess. I was very disappointed by my $16.00 lunch bill. Two stars are for the great service I received."}
{"text":"The drink I had was named The Darkness, in it was some kind of lavender infused something or other, egg white and about six other ingredients of unknown name and origin. And the bartender who suggested it was neither pompous nor pretentious. 

This is the type of bar I would go to in New York City on a daily basis, but not tell anyone about because it's that good. I don't really want anyone to actually come here,  thus making it too busy to enjoy. 

The drink menu is extensive and changes seasonally. Almost every cocktail is $10, which is insanely inexpensive considering the craft and talent and quality they are made with. 

They also offer food late night, I think the comestibles are available until 1am? 

The decor of this place is so perfect it's ridiculous. It plays off Hotel Palomar perfectly with a little bit of a ranch style with mod touches and who knows what else. It's impossible to describe and impossible not to fall in love with. 

Why am I not here right now?"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for upscale post-work drinks downtown. I came here a week ago post-work/pre-DBacks game. The place was packed. They're located at the Hotel Palomar off to the left of the lounge area (where wine hour is served to hotel guests) They have an impressive selection of cocktails, all made with fresh local ingredients. 
I particularly like their cocktail list for those who want something off the beaten path made with an obscure liquor. Highest marks for originality.
I also really like their ice cubes which are slightly larger than your average ice cube and a bit rough. The bartenders are all very friendly but the service is a bit slow. Granted they were very busy so no complaints here other than I really wanted another drink and had to wait.
I highly recommend this place especially if you want a casual yet classy place to grab a drink. Haven't sampled the food yet, but since I work just a few blocks away I'm sure I'll be a regular here before too long.
Did I mention we ran into Drew Carey in the elevator? We were exiting to street level headed to Chase Field and got to share a ride with him to the lower level. Good times!"}
{"text":"Very cute lounge-y bar type feel, despite having big screen tv and the game playing. We had dinner for 2 in a big booth with pillows, so much fun!

Waiter was super friendly and helpful without being overbearing! Drinks were strong and delicious!

We ordered the BHKC chop salad and a pasta dish- both were great, the salad was amazing! I loved the atmosphere and the quiet low-lights loungey feel!

Would come back here in a heartbeat!

We almost walked out without paying by accident! Because it's attached to a hotel, our server brought out the bill with the total, tip, and signature line. So (having had a drink or 2) we calculated the tip, signed, and got up to walk out. Only then did we realize we never have our credit card! Of course, we went back immediately, I would have felt terrible!! Yikes!"}
{"text":"Took us 15 minutes to get a beer with only 5-10 other customers in the entire place (who were already served). Won't go back. For the $9/beer price it should be much better than that!"}
{"text":"I get a kick out of all the hipsters here.  Their pork belly sliders were amazing!  I also enjoyed a coffee drink with whiskey.  I wish their TV over the bar was a little better so I could watch the Suns game more clearly."}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  We loved the cauliflower, peppers, and cocktails.  The desert menu looked great but we were just having apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Incredible cocktails and great happy hour! Staff was super warm and friendly. Deviled eggs, peppers and flatbread were all great. 

You can alway tell what kind of cocktails you are gonna get by the type of ice they use. A big block in my old fashioned set the stage for great drinks! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Sat 7:30p, we walked in and got the best table in the place with no wait.... Not a good sign. Our server was so amped up it was concerning. The brussel sprouts came out basically uncooked. We sent them back and they came back out after we had finished our entree, super dry bland pork chop. Go somewhere else, anywhere else."}
{"text":"I would like to give this more stars, but was only there for shared appetizers before a concert. Service was prompt and courteous. Our waitress' demeanor was a little dry once she realized it wasn't to be a high dollar ticket. We shared the fried green tomatoes and the flatbread pizza if the day. Both were delicious and just enough for two who had light appetites. However, I think the $ rating should be $$$ and not $$. I would return."}
{"text":"We came to this place for our friends birthday dinner Thursday. I was seriously under dressed! but  nobody seemed to mind. The first thing I noticed was this cute coffee table in the lobby area. We sat there and enjoyed some really tasty water, yes water. So good!  Our friends arrived and we moved on to our reserved table. The server was really nice and very helpful with our orders. We had the Mini Harris Ranch Patty Melt ($10.00 small order) they were really good! I drank beer, it was a little warm for my liking. I like ice cold beer, but that's okay. Since we had a medium size group we sampled each others mixed drinks. I really enjoyed every single one of those drinks, they ranged from a really smooth relaxing drink to some with a little more kick. All had just the right amount of alcohol, so you weren't over powered by alcohol. I glanced over to the kitchen and was pleased to see a really clean kitchen area. The chefs looked like they really enjoyed their work. At the end of our evening we were so pleasantly surprised that our birthday girl was given a Pineapple Upside down cake with a lit candle on it, and a birthday card signed by all the chefs and servers. That was such a sweet touch. We will definitely be back here again.  Thumbs up guys, great work!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the service was terrible. Had my water glass filled once. Just really slow service overall. I won't be coming back. Cocktails were good but pricey, but I knew that going in."}
{"text":"Such a cool ambiance and location with excellent whiskey selection and great bartenders. If the food could keep up this would be one of the best spots in downtown."}
{"text":"Updating my review. I was here a little over a year ago and had a terrible experience. I was contacted by the manager with an apology and as a result - I found myself walking by the same place a year later and decided to try again. So glad I did. What a difference!  I'm going to chalk up my last review to a bad day. They also changed the menu a bit and a lot of stuff that we disliked are gone. 

Btw - corsair gin at the bar!  One of the best in the world!!  

Thank you for a good experience."}
{"text":"We had a little difficulty find the restaurant.  Once we did, I was very impressed by the layout and decor. We sat at a table against the wall in the bar area. There was a long table between us and the bar where a 40 y/o was celebrating her birthday. It would have been nicer if they were in the corner of the room instead of the center as they were quite loud.  The birthday girl was very loud every time she opened a present. I guess some people just need attention. Ok, back to the review, our food was delicious and our server Adam D. was great. It would have been better if we were able to hear each other at our table instead of being drowned out by the party."}
{"text":"The location of this place is fantastic, especially this time of year. It over looks the ice skating rink downtown. 

The food was pretty good, although I felt it was a little costly for the food served. 

The seared tuna salad was pretty good."}
{"text":"Fortunately we had a dinner reservation the night we came.   The bar area was packed and the hostess was telling people it would be 3 hours for a table.   There were empty tables in the dining area during our meal so the 3 hour wait seemed incorrect.  Maybe she meant 3 hours to get a table in the bar?   

We really enjoyed our food.  The staff was friendly and efficient.   We had:  
- The BHKC Chop - Full of textures and flavors
- Local Mixed Greens - Overdressed even for my husband's taste which means it had far too much dressing on it 
- Pappardelle - rich and hearty
- Blackened salmon - A little too salty but when eaten with the celery root puree it was very good  
- Apple pie - wonderful!

It was noisy meal due to the busy, large bar area."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a gastropub downtown.  The craft drinks are great.  Love the way the drink menu lists the type - shaken, stirred.  Bourbon on tap?  Now you are talking my language.   Bottomless caramel popcorn?  This place is crazy.

The bar is small and a touch crowded.  There is seating in the lobby but it's a little hit and miss with a variety of chairs ranging from big leather to hard cube.  The dining area isn't very big but it has a cool view - if you are into urban views.  

The food is nicely portioned.  The short ribs are some of the biggest I've seen.  The pineapple upside down cake is great with the salted caramel topping."}
{"text":"I came in for late night cocktails and was blown away by the quality and the professionalism of the staff. The cocktails are very well-conceived and nothing you could expect to find anywhere else, and even their takes on classics go above and beyond. They have a wide selection of high-quality spirits, and the bartenders are very competent and willing to meet you where you're at. If you want to stick with a classic you know and love, they'll hit it out of the park. If you want to try something for the first time and just have them make something up, they'll hit it out of the park.

The only cautionary notes I would throw out is that the place is not a bargain, and it's a bit... fancy. I rode my bike in and felt pretty out of place in tennis shoes and jeans. (An important note, though, the bartenders were still more than friendly and professional.)

tl;dr Come here to experience fine cocktails in a classy setting made by friendly, savvy bartenders. And if you're gonna be fancy, get fancy.

Also! If you're a Bourbon Fan, they have a specialty cocktail that incorporates the smoke of pipe tobacco. My friends and I are still talking about it a week later!"}
{"text":"Being born and bred in North Carolina, I know my shrimp and grits and these, folks, are the REAL DEAL!  Wow! Shrimp tasted so fresh! And the sauce was not overpowering and the grits so authentic and creamy! My husband got the pork shank which just fell off the bone. Wonderful! Wine is pricey ($13/glass) but actually some of the better wine I've had downtown. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for my friend's birthday to get some drinks. The bar and restaurant is really nice and the booths are super comfy with cute, plush pillows. We had already had dinner before coming here, so did not get anything to eat so this review is strictly for drinks and menu. 

This was my first time here and I guess they changed their drink menu for Chinese New Year ( year of the dog) for the entire year. How unfortunate for the servers this entire year. The new menu is very large and all pictures. The last page does have an explanation of the origins of the drink but no explanation of what is actually in the drink, not even the alcohol type. If you are a fan of alcohol drink roulette, this menu is for you. We are not fans, so our poor waitress stood their with us for a good 20 minutes every time we wanted to try something else. What a waste of time. I came there to talk to my friends, not the waitress. No offense to her. 

The first drink I ordered was the one with boba in it. It had a matcha like flavor to it with coconut milk. It was ok. What made it horrible was the boba at the bottom. It wasn't under cooked. It was still raw. The boba balls were super hard. 

The second drink I ordered I think it had gin in it and it had egg whites in it. It had a really light and airyness to it with a touch of lime. I liked this one better than the first one but still didn't love it. 

The last one (picture not taken) was a cocktail that was mostly a mixtures of bitters and that one surprisingly delicious. The drink was rather on the smaller side though so keep that in mind.

The tiki drink that is in my pictures looked cute and my friend ordered it. She seemed to like. She didn't say one way or another. 

Dont forget to park in the parking garage below the restaurant. The restaurant validates parking so parking will be free, which is nice. 

Drinks- 3 stars. 
Drink menu- 1 star.
Ambiance- 4 stars.
Free parking in garage- 5 stars
Total- 3 stars"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here today. Our waitress was super ! The Kentucky fried chicken sandwich was so good!!! That lavender dressing was weird in a good way ! The steak salad with arugula and stone fruit was also very good, the peppers were super spicy.  We would come back for sure. Love the decor and the view."}
{"text":"Came out on a double date last night looking for tapas to share.  From reading the reviews here on Yelp I thought that there would be a ton of options.  There were about 6 small plates with meat and 6 vegetarian.  I admit I don't have a \"sophisticated\" palate and that I am not a gourmet diner.  Nothing on the menu really spoke to me, or the rest of the group.  We ordered a full size dinner of beef stroganoff and the small plates of pork bellied sliders, tater tots, and grilled peppers.  I'm giving the 3 stars because one in the group really liked all three small plates.  The rest of us just liked the hash browns.  The stroganoff was super mushroom-y and not at all beef-y so if you like it that way it is for you.  The peppers were super hot and something in the sauce really upset my stomach and I could hardly eat anything else.  
Add having to wait a while to be seated even with a reservation, a long wait to be greeted by the waitress, and then drinks taking a while to come-I'm just not a fan.  Not a bad place-great location and nice patio.  I just don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Dinner pre-show with the family. We tried a bunch of plates which were pretty good. Starters were my fave, though dad liked the meat options

- Deviled eggs- yum! These were tasty.
- Seared tuna- a few nicely seared slices. fine, but forgettable
- BHKC chop salad- another win- loved the sweet dried corn
- Kale salad- also very good with shaved apple, parm, and a tasty dressing
- Blackened salmon- large piece, perfectly cooked
- Pork shank- not something I would order (I'm veg), but it was tender and B said it tasted even better once you got to the bottom of the skillet where juices mixed with rice and beans
- Flat iron steak- I didn't try the steak, but loved the crispy roasted potatoes which had a nice bit of salt

Everything was fine, server was friendly. Would return for the salads and starters."}
{"text":"I know it's been said already -- but I will echo: this is the type of place downtown Phoenix sorely needs. As a frequent visitor to the area, I've noticed that there is a definite lack of urban, food-centric downtown restaurants with an eye towards innovation. That's what the Blue Hound gives you. The ability to choose small plates or full size entrees is also a nice touch, giving guests the ability to do their own tasting menu of sorts. And with lots of interesting dishes, small plates is the way to go.

Went this past weekend and can tell you, the food was wonderful (bacon jam!) and the atmosphere was great. It's a double edged sword - you don't want to have to wait for a table but it does make it feel more city like when there is a wait. Staff was attentive and Luis the manager did a nice job of going table to table to make sure every guests got a visit. 

I'm hoping this place stays for awhile and continues to come up with creative ways to bring a more urban food scene downtown!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I meet up some friends here before heading to the Eddie Vedder concert on 04 November 2012.  

Meal:  Between the four people at dinner, we had the Kentucky Fried Quail, Kobe Beef Short Ribs, seasonal daily shortbread (couldn't remember exactly what it was), vintner' salad, collard greens, tatter tots, and the mac n' cheese.  Oh, and we had a ton of cocktails.  I think every person at the table had at least 3 drinks each.

Taste:  Real hit or miss.  Somethings were just off the charts in taste and freshness and some things were incredibly boring.  The cocktails were wonderful and it was apparent they use top shelf stuff.  The mac n' cheese was a real let down.  The collard greens were decent at best.  The quail was good but nothing to write home to momma about.  The beef short ribs were top notch, along with the short bread.  I would think the way to go is to go with whatever is the \"daily special\".  7 out of 10.

Value:  Value was horrible.  I understand that the intent of nicer restaurants is that they don't typically serve huge portions, but at the same time, if you drop $150 (without tip), you expect to be full afterwards.  Don't come hungry because you will leave hungry.  The best value was probably the short ribs. 1 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  I liked the service because our server knew that menu inside and out . . . and she was not shy about giving us recommendations.  I like a server whoisn't afraid to share their opinion and directs you away from a potentially bad dish or experience.  Out server was attentive, funny, and friendly, but at times as a little pushy.  9 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  This is a great atmosphere.  It overlooks the city-scape and architecture design is beautiful.  It has a very young yet sophisticated feel to it, but almost any age demographic will fit in.  5 out of 5.

Overall:  Next time I come here, I would probably just come for the drinks and get a small appetizer instead of a full meal.  The atmosphere, drinks, and service is what really makes this place stand out.  I think this would be a great place to meet someone for a date or if you want to go somewhere upscale prior to a concert near by.  22 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Super chill atmosphere and nice decor. We tried this place for lunch and ordered the BHKC Chop Salad and the BHKC Deviled Eggs. The salad was tasty; it's a Mexican spin on a chop salad. The deviled eggs were delicious also. Not many places serve deviled eggs in the valley, but this is definitely one of my favorites. 

I had the Meet Me in Rio drink. Flavorful and fruity and the coconut milk is a nice addition! I look forward to going back soon even though we were unable to get a table tonight."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend last night because the reviews made it seem like the food was great and really friendly service. We were greeted by the hostess and taken to a table near the patio door, but behind some pillar. It was actually nice little seat, secluded from the other patrons with great window views. Unfortunately, when our server came over she neglected to tell us her name, offer any specials, and she barely made eye contact with either myself or my friend. We both ordered drinks (one house special and one whiskey and 7 with lime.) When the server returned with the beverages, she forgot my limes. It not being a big deal, I simply asked for them. She brought them over wadded up in a napkin and they were extremely dry, hardly any juice. Regardless, we ordered the sliders for an appetizer and they were delicious! Truly, some of the best we've ever had. The server came back to take our order, but neglected to offer an refills- of the drinks or the water. Our food came and we waived her down to get a refill of drinks, again no limes. This server *never* asked us how the food was or if she could get us anything else. One would think that charging $12 a drink the servers would be a little friendlier and quicker with service. After waiting nearly three minutes to even find our server, I simply flagged another server down (Simone) to ask for limes. This girl was amazing! Super friendly smile, was on it so quickly, speared the limes with a fancy pick, placed them in a bowl and delivered them to my table- and they were fresh! I wish she was our server, we probably would have had a much better experience. Sadly, at the end of the meal, I had to ask for the tab, because it wasn't offered, and inquired our servers name (Nicolette) simply so I could write this review. There was no charismatic charm, no attention to the guests, no inquiry on how things were going, no offering of specials - drinks or other wise, absurd wait time to receive drinks and garnishments, and absolutely zero interaction with her guests. 

We MAY be back, but to go back for sliders and poor customer service is iffy. The pasta dishes we had were not out of this world, but decent. We would just prefer to go somewhere where the servers actually look like they enjoy their job and interact with patrons. If Simone was our server, we probably would have given her a 100% tip because of how fabulous she was, but Nicolette, it may be time for you to change jobs."}
{"text":"One of the best chopped salads ever!! I added chicken and boy did I get more than my money's worth. I also got a side order of the house fries that have rosemary and Parmesan . Delish!!! Great selection of cocktails, beers and wine and was pleasantly surprised to see they gave Cava by the glass beside the usual champagne and Prosecco. Great service and cool atmosphere. Great for date night or funky place for lunch"}
{"text":"I'm only going to review the breakfast because that was the only meal we ate here. We ate breakfast twice. 

Stayed at the hotel a couple of nights and this place was most convenient for breakfast without leaving the hotel. It's a little pricey for breakfast but it's a nice treat when you're on vacation. It's on the 2nd floor of the Hotel Palomar Cityscape. 

It's quiet, not many people were eating and the server was wonderful. Eggs benedict was great (generous hollandaise sauce), so was denver omelet and regular fried eggs if you want a hot breakfast. I liked the bagels and smoked salmon if you're into a cold plate. Coffee was strong, orange juice was fresh squeezed and the morning ambience was quiet and relaxed. We sat near the window and watched the city wake up. I have no complaints about the food or service. 

We'll probably try dinner here one day soon. Hopefully it's as great as breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is chic modern, the wait staff are definitely happy to have a job at a new establishment, and the menu justifies it's inflated downtown prices.

My first time in was for lunch. I went big and ordered the $16 bacon cheeseburger w a fried egg. It was incredible. The seasoning in the mince and contrasting consistencies between the crispy bacon and gooey egg was a nice combination. We arrived at 1130 to 4-6 tables occupied and left close to 1p with every chair/stool sat in. Parking wasnt easy but was not difficult

My second time was the following week on a Friday night. I wanted to see what the late happy hour, weekend dinner crowd would be like. I was a bit disappointed in the patrons that were there (7p-10p) as it was an older crowd and the environment did not keep up with the potential of the space. I dont know how much of that can be blamed to the restaurant or hotel - unless the marketing budget can increased or the campaign can be redirected. It made me second guess whether this would be my new dinner/hh spot in downtown, or if I would just continue to frequent the central phx/arcadia gems. Parking was horrendous

The dinner ws extravagant - cheddar scallion biscuits with quail eggs and bacon jam (best part was the egg, not worth $9 for two of these bite sized suckers). Kale caesar salad (wouldnt do it again). And chicken friend Quail over foie gras biscuit - enjoyed it but would try something else next time. I actually text my buddy in the middle of the meal, who introduced me to the restaurant, that i enjoyed lunch much more than dinner.

I'd realistically give it another shot for dinner, but unfortunately if it is just lackluster again (by flavor and ambiance), i doubt i'll be there often because it is not in the vicinty of my office for lunch."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our evening here!  We weren't overly hungry but wanted to grab a drink. However, the menu looked so good we ordered 3 apps and salad - the shishito peppers, shredded pork sliders, the ahi starter and Brussell sprout salad.  
The peppers are amazing. Flavorful and not overwhelming with heat. But every 5th one, or so, would remind us that we were eating peppers!  The sliders are a Meal! Filling, yet easy to share. Of all the things we had, we agreed the Brussell salad was amazing!  We might have had a mini fork war. My favorite part of the salad was the fried egg. 
Our server was helpful and very friendly. Yes, definitely worthy of a bookmark and return visits!"}
{"text":"The service was great the waitresses were so knowledgeable about the food! Everything I ordered was super awesome including the desserts and drinks  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This past summer I took my fiancé to the Blue Hound for his going away dinner. I made my reservation online and simply noted that he was heading to Afghanistan and asked for a table with a nice view. 

We arrived and were taken to a table with a fabulous view! I was thoroughly satisfied, but had no idea what was to come. We ordered the Chef's Geek Out and were absolutely blown away by the service, food and accompanying drinks. Little did we know that at the end of our meal the Chef and staff would bring a card to the table, shake his hand and express their sincere appreciation and ask that we please come back when he returns. 

I can't recommend Blue Hound enough and we will gladly return when he gets back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service? Kale salad was the best I've ever had! Server was helpful, will definitely come back again to try other plates. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Well first I will start off with the hostess and the snooty manager. We walked in to eat dinner and we said hi can we get a table for two.  the first thing the manager says is do you have a reservation. In a very rude way. I said \"no, it doesn't look like we need one there is open tables everywhere\" mind you there were tables that said reserved I understand that but the 12 other ones no one was sitting at I didn't think the comment was needed. So then she proceeds to say let me look at what I have available. She suggests the bar, or outside. We say outside is fine, as she's walking us outside she says btw these tables are communal so don't be surprised if someone sits next to you. We said that's fine. The reason I'm writing this is because I want whoever is in charge to recognize their customer service was shit. Rude attitude to sit us, all to be told anyway anyone can sit next to you with a whole empty patio. Instead of making it a hassle in the beginning just say yes we have a table not trying to be pretentious and say oh do you have a reservation. Food was good, reasonably priced. But for the attitude it wasn't as great as the manger thinks"}
{"text":"Didn't even realize this was a hotel restaurant until I started my review! Went for dinner with co-workers and we had a great meal.
For starters we ordered the Shishito Peppers which were good, but not charred enough for my liking. Everyone else loved them! We ordered the grilled pork belly and fried oysters as well. Both were delicious. For our meals we ordered the Arctic Char and Prime Flat Iron, all were mouthwateringly good!
Drinks were plenty and they have a great wine menu.
WHen I'm in Phoenix again, i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for my girlfriend's 40th birthday dinner.  Our waiter, Chris, was awesome and offered amazing selections for drinks and food.  I chose the Lawless and Lamb Shank.  The drink was ah-mazing!  Smelled like a man and tasted smooth and delicious!  The food was fantastic.  Added the juice or sauce from meat to the risotto and made it taste spectacular.  The apps were good too....the rice and cheese balls...forgot the name.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that it is beautiful inside. Loved the decor. Other than that, the staff was friendly for the most part. Too bad you can't control the customers though. Rude, arrogant, snotty, obnoxious, loud, and annoying but my 3 star review was really based on the food. We ordered the fried green tomatoes. Now this is really not a hard dish to put together. They add their own flare to it with crab meat. The presentation was nice BUT, the tomatoes were hard and the crab meat was cold, which seemed odd. Too me, it seems undercooked and maybe the crab meat should have been warmed up. We also tried the boudin balls were just ok as well. They were just warm, not hot. The marina served with it was kinda bland. Just expected more flavor. I \"might\" try this place again but it's towards the bottom of the list."}
{"text":"Probably the okay-est restaurant I've been to. Took a forty minutes to be seated. The waiter was great! I placed my order and a few minutes later, a different staff member came back to tell me they were sold out of the dish I ordered. By the time I finally ate, the quality of food was decent, though small portions. Felt \"blue,\" forgotten and unseen by staff. Felt happy to leave. 

I returned the next night as it this were a toxic relationship and I was asking to get hurt. I spent the last 24 hours, writhing in pain from the food poisoning I received from my first visit. My friend was so poisoned from their food, she only wanted soup. I explained our predicament and pleaded our case. \"Just soup,\" I said, ending my plea. The bar tender could give a flying flip that we got poisoned by THEIR restaurant. We ended our trip with a small sprite that cost $3.50. If you value your GI system, pride, and hope in humanity, skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had high hopes, but we were very disappointed in Blue Hound.

My husband treated me to VIP tickets for Train at Comerica so I treated him to dinner prior to the show....so wanted this place to be great.

Our creds: late 30's executives...DINK's so we enjoy fine dining often. Favorite Gastro-pub in Valley: Citizen Public House Scottsdale...also love Cowboy Caio in Scottsdale.

Pros:
- walking distance to downtown venues
- industrial chic decor
- best cocktail menu I have ever seen

Cons:
- Ironically, the food. Appetizers: pork bellies and cheddar biscuit apps. Pork bellies...we KNOW pork bellies...all over foodie menus across town...these were like rubber bacon. If you want fantastic pork bellies, go to Citizen Public House or Arrogant Butcher. Cheddar biscuits were good but nothing interesting. Dinner: husband had pork neck..it was nice looking but very ordinary and bland. I had Fried Quail...it was yummy...tasted exactly like KFC...came with cold corn bread, cold gravy and precisely 5 cold beans...could not taste the foie gras in the cornbread. Husband asked for bread to have with his pork neck soup...server said they didn't have bread but he would ask the kitchen...he came back with 2 tiny crostinis in a soup bowl...dry, tasteless, odd.

- The service. Hostess (on 9/30 at 5pm) tried to seat us in an almost empty dining room at the one table right next to the table bussing station. REALLY? We asked for another table and she said we can't have any other table because she had to save those for groups of 4...completely understood so we took a table in a far corner. 5 minutes later she sat a couple at the 4-up...she was also unfriendly and didn't seem to want to be there. Our server was blah and wasn't at all passionate about the menu options...Servers at Arrogant Butcher are awesome!

In closing...if you want a fantastic foodie meal in downtown, go to Arrogant Butcher...if you are in Scottsdale, go to Citizen Public House..ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I do love this place. Never gone wrong with the food and the craft cocktails are incredible. The restaurant and bar are all upstairs off of Jefferson so you have a nice view of the area. At Christmas time it over looks the skating rink and Christmas tree so I receommend making reservations by the window so you can view PHX during the holidays. 

Over all this is one of those places that is a must try in Downtown PHX!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressive for a hotel restaurant.  Well, maybe it is just attached to the hotel so shouldn't hold that against the restaurant.  Service was friendly and prompt,  Entrees were appropriately sized and plated for the price.  Shrimp & grits were excellent (especially considering how far removed AZ is from the South Carolina).  

Thumbs up for:  service, food, atmosphere."}
{"text":"Second floor of the Hotel Plimpton. Two blue hounds greet you over blonde wood floors in a dimly lit setting with dark wood tables. Inventive cocktails are a great way to start. Try the lawless; the glass comes upside down soaking in vanilla pipe smoke over which a tasty bourbon concoction is then poured - incredibly delicious!  Appetizers are inviting - the shishito peppers  with siracha aioli are good although no longer so imaginative as they once were. The kale salad was fresh and flavorful. Entrees are where the fool really shines. Fresh handmade pasta with cherry tomatoes are simple but tasty.  An incredibly crispy and juicy game hen with Asian flavors over a bed of fried cauliflower was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I had a morning meeting downtown and a colleague and I needed a place to strategize over breakfast.  He suggested this place.  

After a quick look at the menu, I decided on a Buckwheat Belgian Waffle w/Vermont Maple Syrup, $12.  To wash it down, I ordered a Coffee and Water.

The server brought out a mini-pot of Coffee so that we could refill our cups at our leisure...bonus, I like when a restaurant offers that.  After a short wait our food was served.

I poured a little Syrup on my Waffle and took a bite....it was a little disappointing.  The texture was good and it was cooked just right...however, the flavor fell flat for me.  It tasted too \"grainy\"....not in the rough texture sense, but in the bitter, wild grains sense.  It wasn't what I expected....even the Syrup couldn't save it.  I only ate 1/2 of the Waffle.  Looking back on it, I'd like to try it with an IPA....it might go well with a bitter Beer like that and I love IPA's.  That would be weird though, ordering a Waffle at breakfast and a tall glass of IPA...ha!

Our server was great and the place is very well kept.  If I come back, I'll be sure to try something that I'm more familiar with.

Return Factor 50%"}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed my dining experience at Blue Hound. My hubby made reservations for six to celebrate my bday and it was fantastic - from the service, the atmosphere, the drinks and the food! 

My recommendations are pretty much everything I ordered:

Shishito peppers
Corn grit fries
Deviled eggs
Shrimp and Grits
Drink: The Melody

I also received a complimentary dessert for my birthday, which is always nice! Everyone in my party loved the restaurant and food as well. I definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I am always up for a great cocktail and a classy atmosphere, and blue hound has both! Their list of cocktails is extensive and the knowledge of their staff is substantial as well. The only issue I ran into was price. Now for drinks only it's fairly reasonable considering the area and skill of the staff, but the food seemed a little pricey. The food was delicious just a little expensive for portion size."}
{"text":"Love this lunch spot! Today I ordered the chop salad which is awesome. Probably only second to Cowboy Chow in Scottsdale. You never have to wait at lunch for a table and the service is incredible. After work hours - the drinks are good but the service does slow down a little - likely because they are more busy at night than during the day. All and all, great restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and it's hard to get to with construction going on and all the one way streets.  You really have to know downtown Phx to get to the valet or public parking.  

Once we got to the Palomar Hotel to the 2nd floor to the Blue Hound Kitchen it was very nice.  The ambience really has a cool vibe and a very urban feeling.  I checked out the website and the pictures do not do it justice.  

We had drinks at the side bar and the waitress was very attentive to the point we had to tell her we are meeting another couple, we are going to chat THEN we will sit down at our table.  Granted it was restaurant week but it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be.  Anyhow, we finally sit and peruse the menu.  It looked amazing so we decide instead of ordering the set restaurant week menu we would order the appetizers and try them out.  They were intriguing to us.  We order a fabulous bottle of Petite Syrah for only $40 bucks.....

2 hours later we tried pretty much tried all the appetizers and they were delicious.  Great flavors, the corn appetizer you have to cut yourself off the cob.  Corn cutting of the cob skills needed!  It was fun and filling.  We did manage to order the beef short ribs and 3 out 4 thought they were fabulous.  Our 4th person thought it had way too much fat for what you are paying...30+.  He did think the flavor and taste was great! 

Our waiter was pretty good.  He was attentive for certain things but we sat with empty and near empty water glasses for awhile. All in all it was a great experience...little things like the bar waitress being too attentive I guess makes up for our waiter not being as attentive with certain things.

Would I go here again?  Yes!"}
{"text":"Went to Blue Hound Kitchen just for dessert and cocktails! It's in the lobby of the beautiful Palomar Hotel at City Scape, a Kimpton Hotel. 

I have been to Blue Hound a couple of times for happy hour and have not been disappointed. I was definitely not disappointed for dessert. 

I had the \"Lost Melody\" cocktail which I have enjoyed on a previous visit. Made with pisco, coconut cream, rose flower water and a couple of other ingredients. Delicious. 

For dessert I had the chocolate pudding. Served in a jar with layers of graham crackers, chocolate pudding and marshmallow fluff. Vanilla ice cream and peanuts are served on the side. Oh so good! 

If you are just going for cocktails, snacks or desserts, sit in the lounge right off the lobby. Great for people watching! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here last night prior to the Paul McCartney concert.  Food was good, but the noisy atmosphere was awful.  Could not even talk to my wife without yelling which is what everyone else in the place was doing.  Server said the noise was because of the concert and that they were crowded.  It is a bad physical design with nothing but hard surfaces.  Go for the food but not the ambiance."}
{"text":"Nicholette was such a great waitress. Very friendly and helpful when needing helping choosing an entree. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Everything was absolute perfection. We came in with 5 people for our reservation early and they sat us as soon as they could. The restaurant itself has wonderful atmosphere. We started with drinks, great drink menu, very creative. For appetizers we had the flatbread which was just okay and the fried polenta (you can definitely do without this)....the entrees were AMAZING. We tried a little of everything. Pork shank, Brussel sprouts, salmon, rainbow trout, fried green tomatoes & the shrimp and grits!  My favorite was the Brussels and the rainbow trout. We also tried the pineapple upside down cake, HOW IS IT SO DELICIOUS. 

Great service too. Come here, tell your friends about it."}
{"text":"What a place!

My wife and I came here for our 1st Anniversary. Having made the reservation on open table I added the note that it was a special occasion. 

We were greeted with complimentary champagne and a custom made salad. Our server Justis was fantastic. Walking us through the menu and offering great suggestions. 

The food was mind-blowing. The BBQ ribs are the best I have ever tasted. So tender it does just fall off the bone. The fries were a nice side and rounded off the meal very well. In short everything we ordered was great!

And last but not least was the amazing desert. The chocolate creme brûlée, enough for two and so tasty it left us wanting to come back just for that alone. 

Blue Hound has become our new favorite spot, and we will cherish this meal for years as it was the most memorable way to spend our 1st wedding anniversary. Even got a signed card from the entire staff. Just amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. I was in town for a weekend getaway with a friend and our hotel (downstairs) recommended a drink here. I guess the concept is love or hate and I fall into the latter category -- the previous reviewer who likened it to liquor roulette is right on target. Upon arrival, the hostess seemed confused about what we were there for. \"Just a couple of drinks at the bar\" shouldn't be too difficult to decipher. She asked us if we had a reservation. \"For drinks? No...\" We ended up on these massive high-tops in the middle of the front room and it took us a few minutes to procure a drink menu. 

We couldn't really see the menu to begin with but once we repositioned and used our phone lights we managed to make it out. It felt like a Cheesecake Factory menu -- giant, laminated, (ironic?) stock photo looking. And of course, there is ZERO explanation of what is in each drink. We just stared at the prices, origin of the drinks, and ridiculous looking photos. For $17 I want to know what kind of liquor I'm \"gambling\" with. After many questions and much deliberation with the waitress, my friend settled on a tiki drink she had not tried before. We're both fans of a traditional Daiquiri and Mai Tai (and I'm partial to Navy Grog) so we thought we couldn't go wrong. And yet...

Her drink was \"special.\" At least the luxardos (three in total and that accounts for the only positive experience in this place) almost made up for the weird bitterness of the drink. I went a different route after asking our server for a gin-based recommendation. Her response was \"we only serve gin...no vodka\" which is fine, given that I asked for a gin-based recommendation. She gave me one and I agreed. Her description made it sound light and refreshing. When my stupidly expensive drink showed up 15 minutes later I could smell it before it even hit the table. Took a sip and immediately coughed at the peaty smokiness and unmistakably NOT GIN drink. Laphroaig. How do you confuse Laphroaig with gin? Or why would you even try to guess or make up ingredients if you have no idea? By the time all was said and the slow service was done, all we could do was laugh at the gimmicky menu and the childish looking photos. When I checked out of the hotel and saw the $44 charge for two drinks, I wasn't laughing anymore."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent.  Highly recommend the shrimp and grits.  Chris W., our waiter, was wonderful.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! 

Lets start with the decor and ambiance. Well above average. Very swanky retro feel but cozy with plenty of wood details and great energy throughout the space. Awesome hip, urban eatery. More than you'd expect from a restaurant within a hotel in downtown Phoenix. I'd come back just for the restaurant even if I wasn't staying at the hotel. 

Started off with the yellow corn cake app with onion jam and shaved squash=fantastic! We then shared the 'Big Ass Steak' with scallop potatoes. Equally fantastic. An enormous T-bone cooked just right:) at least 2\" thick!

Had two Mezcal cocktails with my dinner.  Good, strong drinks with old fashioned big ass ice cubes. Awesome looking and tasty drink if you like Mezcal. 

Great joint. Wouldn't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, until last saturday night.  Brought family from out of town to my Fav place.  went to the roof top pool area and had beverages, great fun. then down to the Blue Hound for more bevs, coffee and dessert, it was 8:30pm, no people waiting in the lobby, full bar area, 1 table on the patio and maybe 50% full in the dinning room. (waiters standing around) we were told we could only sit at a table in the DR or Patio if we all had full meals. ok so we saw 1 booth empty, in the bar area and walked over...as we began to sit the hostess came over and said this was a Dinner table and we could not sit here.  So back to the front area and we were told we could sit out in the lobby but there was no service there.  After being in the hospitality industry myself for over 35 yrs. I was amazed that we were being turned away....by this time it was almost 9pm....I sure hope they got a mad rush for dinner at that hour........we left and will not come back.  This was my birthday place for the last 3 yrs and I take everyone that comes to Phx to this place......but no more. I have never felt so unwelcomed.....shame on you Mr Manager for treating us this way."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of mixed drinks and cocktails. I would try something new if I were you, they've done everything right.

Tonight we shared appetizers and enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"I have been to Blue Hound five times now, once just for cocktails and four times to eat dinner, so I figured it was time to review it.  I really want to like the Blue Hound, and I know people that do like it, but it has three big problems.  1) The service is too slow  2) it takes itself WAY too seriously (which leads back to #1) and 3) the plates are USUALLY tiny for the price (and there is too much variation in sizes between similarly priced items, so you never know what you're going to get.   Let me expound.  I have no problem with hipsters.  I live downtown, it comes with the territory.  I like the buzzwords \"crafted\", \"local\", and the such.  That said...

The Blue Hound has good cocktails.  Good, very expensive, very slow to arrive cocktails.  The ingredients are quality and the drinks are inventive, but $10-$15 is just too much.  I also would rather get mine quickly than watch your bartender painstakingly shave off the Mona Lisa of ice cubes and perform other elaborate rituals.  Also, and the food suffers from this too, the description of the drink is way too preciously obtuse to actually divine what is in it.  Here's an example: last night Sweet Pea ordered something called Thirstn Howl (pardon my spelling.)  It listed the ingredients, and one of them was something called banane something or other that nobody has ever heard of before.  So, you expect it to have banana.  This thing came out and it was a banana milkshake.

The food, well- the food.  Again, I'm a vegetarian, so take that for what it is.  Blue Hound doesn't have a true veg entree, but they have a lot of veg options in their small plates.  I believe that one time when I was there, they did have a veg entree, a risotto or something, but that has somehow fallen by the wayside.  I would like to see it come back.  Anyway, the problem with the veg plates is that they are too small for a single person to eat one for dinner (and I don't eat a lot), so you have to order a couple. And then the variation between plate sizes is all over the map, so you have to either ask your server or you have to cross your fingers. The time before last that I went there, I asked my server if the Panzanella salad was enough for me as my only food for dinner.  He said oh yes!  It came out, and it was a very small bowl filled with 98% hard, tasteless croutons.  The \"artichoke, fava beans, burnt baby leeks?\"  Again- it is hard to tell what it's going to be from that description, but there were 3 small pieces of each.  

Last time I was there, I tried the roasted cauliflower based on good Yelp comments, and the collard greens salad (because I love collard greens), and I have to admit- they were my favorite things I've had there.  Although, the collard green salad was VERY salty, and both were too oily (which is something that I find in general with BH's food.)  The two of them together were enough for me for dinner, but as I said- the plates there are small.  And pricey.  And all over the place in terms of relative size, and you can't tell what you're going to get.  

I've been with a lot of people and seen a lot of different things ordered.  Lots of people get the ribs and like the ribs, and that's a big plate. Unfortunately, last time we were there, Sweet Pea (a notorious carnivore and lover of meat) got the ribs and said that he felt sick all the next day, and they were just \"OK.\"  He asked for extra blue cheese on the grits and got a \"well...I can ask...\" from the server.  When it came out, there was a big production of saying \"with the EXTRA blue cheese\", but Sweet Pea said he couldn't taste it, and the grits were very bland (I heard that from too others that ordered the same on the same night also.)  I've also seen someone order the scallops, which came up strangely lined up with no accoutrement on the very outer edge of a very large, oval plate, which only emphasized how little food she was getting for $20.  The food comes out VERY slow.  

Service:  I've seen no earlier than 45 minutes and as long as 1.5 hours to get the food.  That's kind of a bummer.  It would be better if my cocktails were quicker to arrive and not so costly.

Anyway, I think I'm done with the Blue Hound.  I really really REALLY wanted to like it."}
{"text":"I agree with another poster who loved the urban vibe of this restaurant/bar. What a cool place! We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Once seated, we waited for a while for service. I flagged down the manager, and a server came over immediately. The drink menu is extensive with over 30 specialty drinks, so I decided to forgo my usual beer for a fancy beverage, a Absinthe Fizz. My husband stuck with a glass of Pino. When our drinks arrived, mine was frothy and delicious! I highly recommend trying this drink if you want something refreshing but not froo froo. We order the tater tots as an appetizer, per a suggestion from a Kimpton sales rep my husband met through work. I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio and my husband ordered the Kentucky Fried Quail. The tots were wonderful, but I really didn't get the sauce. It was cold and did not have much flavor. Our food arrived while we were working on our appetizer. The entrees were excellent! Portions are small, but were fine for a light dinner. We actually went across the street to Copper Blues for a drink, then we returned to Blue Hound for a nightcap. We ended up sitting in a cozy booth by the bar upon our return. We ordered the Mac N Cheese to split and Tommy's Margarita. The Mac N Cheese was wonderful, but the portion was quite small. On the flip side, the prices are super reasonable, so if you are really hungry, order 2 appetizers with your meal. A couple of kinks, which is to be expected when you choose to dine at a new restaurant.  There were many items on the menu I wanted to try, so we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"What a venue!  The atmosphere is amazing, loud and fun.  The decor is unique, contemporary goth.  And the food!  Cocktails were fabulous and unusual, the appetizers scrumptious, and the meal was memorable.  (and I'm picky!)  Don't walk, RUN downtown as fast as possible!"}
{"text":"JESUS MARY AND JOSEPH [hysterics pertaining to cocktail menu].

If one yelp star is equivalent to one cocktail ordered, 5 stars. If one yelp star is equivalent to the number of stars seen each time a sip is had, 242 stars (approximate). Four of the five drinks I ordered here were some of the best I've ever had. Here are those I oh so wholeheartedly recommend:

The Lost Melody [Smirnoff, grapefruit liqueur, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, rose flower water] - Sweet and zesty, but complex, like Nicole Kidman wearing lip smackers. The coconut cream was subtle and added textural notes, any subsequent creaminess was barely present. The Smirnoff, grapefruit liqueur, and grapefruit juice blended nicely into a cohesive chorus. The spritz of rose water was like a whimsical kiss complimenting the coconut and grapefruit yet standing out entirely on its own. Eyes wide shut as I catch the last drop.

The Lawless [Dickel rye, \"truck stop\" bitters (house creation), wormwood liqueur, tobacco smoke] - What I'd imagine Pierce Brosnan might order. Throughout the night my girlfriend and I were hit with allusive wafts of some enchanting smokey-burnt vanilla scent. Thanks to a few rich old dogs at the end of the bar, we discovered it was The Lawless. As noted above, the drink is made with vanilla-laced tobacco smoke. The tobacco is set on a small stone skillet, torched to flames, and then cupped by an icey-chilled glass, allowing the embers to smolder and suffocate within. The stone skillet and upside-down smoke filled glass are placed in front of you, the glass is turned upright, and the previously mixed rye and wormwood concoction is hastily poured into the smokey abyss before the buildings' ventilation system ruins everyones fun. The smoke isn't just a good show -- it adds a bold extrasensory element that can be noted most obviously in the sip or two before the smoke dissipates but also more subtly like a fragrant ghost lingering in the since tar-glazed inside walls of the glass itself. The drink is icey but earthy, rugged but debonair. Two fingers of drink are comprised of silky-strong Dickle rye, savory-musky house mixologist made \"truck stop\" bitters, and a sweet ethereal essence of which by process of elimination I must conclude is the wormwood liquor. This drink is the definition of dapper, the last word in the book of brawn, and I will forever seek a drink of this caliber and excellence, though I am afraid I will forever be underwhelmed. More on this drink by PUNCH can found here: punchdrink.com/recipes/lawless

The Oaxacan Punch [Partida reposada, pierre ferrand brandy, passion fruit horchata (house made), nutmeg] - Note: the horchata is house made. Something about this drink makes me feel all winter cabin, open fire, and knit sweaters. Sweet, warm, nutty, wholesome deliciousness. For the skeptics: the passion fruit element isn't overly distinct, adding only a slight tangy agitation to the other flavors, expanding the drink as a whole. 

The Darkness [Bols,? vida mezcal, montenegro, lemon, lavender, egg white] - This was, of all the drinks ordered, the least impressive. Not because it wasn't outstanding relative to literally anywhere else you might order an egg white cocktail, but because it was among all of the other perplexingly excellent concoctions the Blue Hound has to offer. This drink is timeless and refined. The faint note of lavender was my favorite element of the drink, though as a whole is exceptionally cohesive and balanced. 

In summation: Perusing the remaining items of the cocktail menu, you might see other interesting ingredients like sarsaparilla, pink pepper watermelon shrub, and celery bitters -- only adding to the sentiment that I wish I could have tried all the things. Located in the lobby of a luxury hotel, the atmosphere has an air of money and high-art, lending itself more toward the hip-young-adult / professional-fancy-pants realm, although impresively refraining from feeling uncomfortable, stuffy, or exclusive. The Blue Hound is an exemplary model everything a cocktail bar can be and I am stoked that my week-long Phoenix visit yielded such a discovery. I will be scouring my home city of Boston for anything that can hold a candle (or a bunch of burning vanilla tobacco) to this dashing top-notch joint."}
{"text":"Phoenix never ceases to amaze me. The food here is excellent. We had a variety of things tonight and all of them were fabulous! Come you will not be disappointed!  Service was excellent and fast."}
{"text":"Brunch drinks and ambiance (Vinyl Station) were fabulous! Food was ok. They definitely do not know how to make fried chicken. They need to visit Willie Mayes in NOLA or The Tuck Shop locally to understand fried chicken needs to have actual flavor."}
{"text":"As with all our reviews, we rate Food, Atmosphere and Service.

Blue Hound nails it on all fronts. 

The food is unique - I've never even seen most of these dishes on any other menu - and ranged from good to \"Oh My Gawd This Is Amazing!\" The bar is stocked with a terrific range of spirits with a particular emphasis on small batch American liquors. 

The atmosphere is inviting with lots of comfortable seating and a good size bar to sit or stand around. The restaurant is located in the Palomar Hotel and - in keeping with the general vibe of an upscale/downtown hotel - has high ceilings, lots of wood and glass and a modern-but-not-too-trendy decor. It's a very nice place for a date or an evening with friends. 

The service was terrific. We sat at the bar and our bartender Jesse, who was quite knowledgeable,  kept us hydrated without interjecting himself into our evening. 

Cheyenne - who is, I believe, the Food & Beverage Manager - dropped by and talked with us, sharing her experience in the food industry in Phoenix. Cheyenne has been at Blue Hound since its opening and has a great sense of downtown Phoenix history of the hotel/restaurant industry. She's quite an asset to the Blue Hound.

We had the privilege of meeting Executive Chef Stephen Jones who personally delivered some of our menu items. This guy is good. He's created a menu that's a combo of southern-home cookin' \"Comfort food with a grown-up flavor palate\" and Asian fusion that doesn't exist anywhere else in the valley.  Chef Jones is a kind, generous and wonderful host who is quick with a smile and knows how to entice your adventurous side, delivering on all aspects of a dish. Food should taste as good as it looks and it does so here at Blue Hound.  Chef Jones does that and more; he's got a flair for the unexpected and a terrific flavor sense. Tater tots are not just simply Tater tots. Deviled Eggs are not simply eggs and Cheddar Biscuits are not just biscuits.  

Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this to elevate the flavor palate environment in order to become a \"go to\" destination,  Blue Hound is doing it's part, others need to join. 

The Food: if it seems like we ate a lot,  we did. We were treated to the very best Blue Hound has to offer, The food was exceptional.

We tried everything on the \"Snacks\" menu except the cheese plate and enjoyed it all. There's something here for every taste.

Shishito Peppers: This is a usually mild but sometimes hot small pepper, that's blistered and served in miso & sesame seeds and seasoned with sel gris. I abso-freaking-lutely loved these things. The texture and flavor are perfection in an appetizer. The Miso is exceptional and the sel gris (salt) is the finishing balanced touch done right. 

Caramel Popcorn: This was actually pretty darned amazing. The menu says \"butterscotch with ancho chile\" which sounded a little iffy to me, but the execution was flawless. They call this endless which means if you are like me, you could eat about 8 pounds of this stuff. Very good.

Deviled Eggs: This one is surprising. It's \"just\" deviled eggs, but its garnished with brioche, smoked ham and dijon. The flavor is subtle and rich, and the eggs are so creamy it's criminal. This is another dish you could easily eat waaaaaay too much of.

Tater Tots: Chef Stephen nails it on this little dish. The texture of the tots is fabulous, and the upfront initial  flavor of potato and chive is oh so nice,  lets not forget bacon too.  These are tater tots for grown ups. You can use the dipping sauce that is served on the side but theses little babies don't need anything added. They are dangerous mouth popping snacks. 

Potato Fries: French fries are one of those ubiquitous dishes that can be really boring. Not here. These are sliced in wedges, steak fry size, and perfectly fried and seasoned. The outside was crispy and the inside soft and creamy. Seasoned with aromatic rosemary and a very nice parmegiano-reggiano cheese, and served with a not-too-spicy aioli, its just another unique twist on what's normally an oh-so-common food.

Cheddar Scallion Biscuits: Oh My Gosh. Just try 'em. Trust me.

All we had on the \"Farm & Garden\" section of the menu was the Roasted Cauliflower, but in typical Chef Jones fashion, he puts a unique twist on it with pistachios, capers and currants. However, everything else on that section of the menu looks absolutely fabulous and we are eager to try it all.

The \"Sea & Ocean\" section of the menu looks very appetizing. We tried two dishes which pretty much blew our minds: First, the Bay Scallop Ceviche. Chef Jones said \"It's not what you think\" and he was 100% correct, it was uh-maz-ing! Second, the Jerk Cured Scottish Salmon: buttery and melt in your mouth. Both were utterly unique and ridiculously flavorful.

There's more on the menu, but there's just so much two people can eat in an evening.  We cannot wait to get back."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots for lunch in downtown Phoenix, but the happy hour made me happy too.  I recommend the turkey burger (add grilled onions), wings (spicy!) and shishito peppers to start.  But everything is high quality and well prepared.  I will see you again soon, Blue Hound."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very friendly and experienced bartenders . Exceeded expectation - the bourbon \"lawless\" was excellent. Shared big ass steak and 
 adequate for both of us ."}
{"text":"Amazing service and tasty, creative food!  I had the pork belly sliders, roasted cauliflower, and hamachi.  I didn't expect to clean my plate but each dish was expertly prepared and just so good!  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and helpful, and customer service was top notch, overall.  A great Phoenix dining experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service and the food was wonderful. Love the variety of menu options as well."}
{"text":"Great deviled eggs. Had to order another round. They where out of the catfish but the service was great and the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst, over priced, basic food I have ever eaten. My suggestion is to avoid this place at all costs. Who ever reviewed this place has even half way decent is lying to themselves. Service was mediocre at best, wait time was a joke and the hostess had the odassity to ask if I had a reservation. I looked over at the dining area and said, \" Do I need one\". Normally, I would have but my wife and I saw how empty place was and decided, \"Hey, that looks like a quite place to eat.  Not to many people\". Literally it was a Saturday evening with about 5 tables full and 15 open.

Either way I base my reviews on the food quality and service, both were terrible and I will never suggest this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Our server (Molly) was smart, engaging and attentive. We shared deviled eggs (uniquely prepared with bacon jam-delish) and short rib sliders that melt in your mouth. We also shared shrimp and grits for our entrée. Perfectly cooked shrimp with tons of flavor but not excessively spicy. The creamiest grits you could imagine. 

I ordered the Lawless cocktail... if you are a bourbon drinker this will knock your socks off. Bourbon, bitters and wormwood liqueur, poured into a glass filled with loose-leaf tobacco smoke at your table. It's a captivating presentation and really yummy. 

It was a birthday celebration and they treated me very well! 

Don't miss this one."}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown! We came for dinner before an event at the Orpheum, and we're able to walk over after. I had the turkey burger with a lemon aoli amd my husband had the fish amd chips. Both of us loved our food. After the concert we even ce back for dessert! Apple crumble with vanilla gelato! So good. The service was great, too! If you want a quiet place to eat, this isn't the place for you. But, if you want a fun pub atmosphere with fantastic food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Wow! Super trendy spot! I didn't know this existed downtown until my friend decided to go for his bday. Love the atmosphere! We sat inside but the outdoor patio (which is on the top of the second floor of the Palomar hotel) looked more inviting, with those little string of lights hung across the patio and some plants out there too. I'll have to sit there next time we have dinner there.
I had the homemade pasta which half of our table ordered. It was so flavorful and a great portion that no one had leftovers. 
The hostess was super friendly, complimented me right away -which actually seemed genuine! Thumbs up! I noticed on the menu it said happy birthday on it. I'm not sure if it's because we were celebrating a bday or if it's on every menu. The bday celebrant didn't want any dessert unfortunately when they were offering, but the restaurant did all sign a bday card to give to him. Which blew our minds! What a caring staff. 

We are definitely coming back for the next birthday dinner- and this time we will order dessert!"}
{"text":"Totally good. Great atmosphere, excellent service, cleverly varied yet affordable menu. Upscale but reasonably priced at the same time. They have a really great food selection for  any group, accomodating all dining predilections and hunger levels ( half plates available). Drinks excellently prepared though slightly pricey. Save money by hitting happy hour when the special mixed drinks are $7."}
{"text":"this place has amazing cocktails. Sure you can get your vodka and soda, but try their cocktail menu; you won't be disappointed. 

Meals there are really good. I love how they have so many small plates to choose from. I recommend sharing a bunch of small and medium plates. 

Deviled eggs are a must, as are their flatbreads.

It can get busy, so make reservations!"}
{"text":"Order their Old Fashioned. 
And the tater tots. 

Trendy? Hipster, even? Who gives a....? The bartenders are the most attentive I've seen, and I appreciate watching them craft some of the finest cocktails I've had in Phoenix. 

Try this place - you won't be disappointed.  From the moment you walk in, you can tell the folks here love their jobs."}
{"text":"Found this place on Open Table while looking for somewhere to dine before a concert.  I was a little surprised to find out it was in a hotel but no biggie.  They had some very interesting drinks.  I had the \"If You'd've Been There\" and my colleague had the \"Black Pepper Pink Melon\".  My drink was good but his was delicious!  The watermelon ice was the best part.

We shared their Mac N Cheese which had Cheetos on top.  It was really good!  I had the Shrimp and Grits which was also good.  

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I was eating solo here and they were very rude. I clearly asked for a table, the offered me to sit at the bar, I mentioned I want to get a table, then they offered me to sit at the lounge (which had only coffee table). Only when I said I will leave if they don't have a table, they offered me the table. They had plenty of empty tables. The food is OK but not the best."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots in downtown!! Awesome cocktails, friendly waitstaff and some of the most experienced and well versed bartenders I have ever had. 

The pork belly sliders, the seemingly traditional downtown PHX shishito peppers and the casual atmosphere make BHK one of the best jump offs for a night in the central corridor. Perfect start, or end, to every night.. Definitely gets packed during the peak dinner hours tho! So go prepared!!"}
{"text":"Cool place. We came in specifically for drinks, though I've heard their food is great.

The place was not busy at all, so we were easily able to grab a seat at the bar. This place has a nice warm, east coast big city type feel to it. Love. They also have a nice little patio that over looks Central and the west part of Cityscape. 

Our bartender was very nice and patient w/ us while we decided what to order. I decided on the Floradora, a drink on their hangover menu (not because I was hungover, but because it sounded delicious). And it was, and was gone far too quickly for the price, about $9-$10 a piece. Price aside, their craft cocktail menu is vast and they also have a nice Bourbon, Gin, Tequila, and Scotch selection.

I would definitely recommend this place for happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"Listen, don't be fooled by those weak stars you see up there, this is no 3 star place. The food is absolutely BOMB! My goodness!

First exposure to this place was at the Best Of Phoenix event at the Science Center, back in October. There they were serving a duck pate that was soo good I went back 3 times. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it again, but since then they've taken it off the menu, apparently people didn't order it enough. Well \"people\" have bad taste because that pate was incredible. 

Tonight, at the suggestion of a new friend's tweet (Proof: https://twitter.com/GPJFF/status/280127623324123137) I ordered the Kentucky Fried Quail and it was UH-mazing, especially that scrumptious gravy with the red beans.  My friends ordered the Prosciutto Flatbread (the pesto on it is soooo gooood!!) and the Short Rib (it's huge! He got a half order and couldn't finish it, even with sharing). We started with the Tater Tots with that really nice harissa (sp?) sauce, which I had never had before, and the Pulled Pork johnny cakes. 

What topped it all off though, were the incredibly rich desserts. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I never get dessert when I go out, but dang! The Doughnut Holes and that xocolatl (sp?) sauce just put me over the moon! Sooo good! Also, the Bread Pudding was cruciallll with the bacon ice cream? Bomb. So, so bomb. 


Nuff said, I'm coming back. I miss it already. Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Another great find from my coworker. Located as part of the hotel, this restaurant was amazing from start to finish with exceptional service from our waitress Natalie! Even the menu was cute and had whimsical categories like \"Just Like Mama Made\" and \"Light as a Feather.\" The Lost Melody was my favorite!

To start we had some amazing cocktails and had appetizers such as the corn grit fries, bacon deviled eggs, and short rib sliders. The corn grit fries were perfectly described as mozzarella sticks meet cornbread. The bacon deviled eggs were absolutely perfect, a different twist to a standard deviled egg. The short rib sliders were the star, tender meat with horseradish on a mini King Hawaiian roll. AMAZING!

Most of our table of 10 ordered the flat iron steak. Cooked perfectly, a little too rare for my medium rare taste, but really good. Fingerling potatoes and crispy frites were a perfect component to the dish. They also have yummy housemade pasta, friend really enjoyed her pappardelle.

The best touch was that with an opentable note saying it was our coworker's bday, they not only brought a great dessert but a card signed by all the staff including the chef! Who does that nowadays? So thoughtful!!! I didn't think I would like the chocolate pudding with marshmallow puff, but it was really good! I ordered the chocolate cake with peanut butter caramel with banana ice cream because it sounded so different and I like that combination, but would have to say the pudding was much tastier!

Overall, such a great dining experience from beginning to end! Will come back if I'm ever in the Phoenix area, as it was the best dining moment I had during my short stay here."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 2x now and am a BH groupie,  I think. I'd highly recommend waiting for a coveted patio seating - excellent cityscape views and close enough to people watch (one of my hobbies).

Brunch here is truly divine - especially if it's a nice, blue-sky day. I had the egg frittata and Mimosa. Dinner is great also. Very relaxed and ideal place for date, friends or chill \"unwind\" place w/coworker(s)! 

Try the ceviche tacos - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. The Tots (Tater) are scrumptious also.

Also LOVE the fact that they have ability to make the Nat'l drink of Peru - the Pisco Sour. 

My colleague and I were treated like royalty here - customer service blew me away. We had 2 separate servers (one for meal and other for drinks, etc), and they were so friendly and helpful. They both did frequent check-ins without being pesky flies. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their names. Our female server never batted an eye when I requested \"a side of olive brine for my STRONG dirty martini\". Made me feel nice inside. :)

Great job, Hound!"}
{"text":"Food is good - the paperdelle with sausage ragu was GREAT.  Drinks were inventive, modern, cool.  Bartenders were great - fast, friendly, helpful, but could stand a bit more training.  I overheard one describe Aperol as being cherry flavored, and another, when describing a whiskey I was unfamiliar with told me that it was named based on the type of grain in it.  That seemed odd, so I looked it up and found out it was the name of the still used, not a grain.  I realize these things aren't the end of the world, and we're in Phoenix, not New York or San Francisco, but as a former service industry peon and eventual manager who stupidly described something she did not understand and has never forgotten the shame, I'm always in favor of better training.
The space is cozy and welcoming - definitely worth checking out.
And if you want to really wow a date this winter, take them ice skating and then pop in here for the o.g. lawless.  Third date material shiz right there."}
{"text":"Came in for Happy Hour drinks and dinner after work.  Husband and I both ordered the Bourbon Smash ($6 HH) (a take on a whiskey sour), both came out very sour.  My friend's margarita also came out sour.  We think they were training a new bartender.  The drinks were easily fixes with a splash of syrup.

Orders the sliders and wings ($6 HH).  The short rib sliders were fantastic!  I was not expecting such a huge portion of short rib (my favorite).  Seriously, add a few more sliders and some fries and you would have the perfect bar food happy hour meal!

I feel guilty not ordering some of fancy food for dinner, the shrimp and grits sounded divine, but I was craving a burger all week.  Their bar burger with pimento cheese, and bacon hit the spot in all the right ways :-) ($14) and the fries were topped with sea salt and cheese.  Blue Hound pays attention to detail.  Husband ordered the Manhattan ($6HH)...BOY WAS IT GOOD AND I DON'T USUALLY LIKE MANHATTANS!).  To top it off, I ordered the local AZ  Dos Cabezas Rose wine ( great recommendation from our waiter and a steal at $5 HH).

I recommend Blue Hound over its more uppity sister upstairs (Lustre) and will add it to our favorite cityscape places."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our 26th anniversary dinner, while stating at the hotel, and the experience the staff of Blue Hound provided ranked this dinner among the top three of my life! Through out the staff at Blue Hound was attentive and professional, but also gave us our space. We were seated against a window with views of Phoenix skyline and the old court building, On our table was a card congratulating us on our anniversary signed by several people on the staff (one wishing us Happy Birthday - my wife's favorite).

We started with cocktails and at the waiter's suggestion I had a Lawless (Bourbon, homemade bitters and liqueur and served in a glass that was presented upside down over smoldering tobacco smoke). It was sweeter than I expected but very balanced. My wife enjoyed the Romeo & Violette, choosing only based on the name of the drink. Her drink was not as sweet as I expected but similarly balanced.

For dinner we both had the Chef and Bar Geek out for $48.00 each. This was four courses, of which three were served with cocktails and none were on the menu. The manager, mixologist, sous chef, and chef each visited our table several times. They started by asking for preferences and allergies (non) and then explained each cocktail and course. 

The first course did not have a cocktail and was a cod served with olive oil, fennel and other ingredients the four cocktails now have me forgetting. The dish was mild with tangs from the fennel and spices. I remember thinking that I'd never have order this on a menu based on the description (I need to broaden my horizons), but it was amazing!

The second course came out after we were presented with a watermelon flavored and vodka based cocktail served with the foam of egg whites on top. We were guessing what the course might be based on the drink, but didn't come close. The second course was soft shelled crab on a bed of local sweet corn. We had never had soft shelled crab before so the waiter explained that we did not need to remove the shell, but could just enjoy it all. I enjoy crab, so I'm not sure why I've never had soft shelled crab. All together it was delicious again and also something I'd never have considered reading on a menu. 

The third course came out after we were presented with a cocktail based on the house mulled wine topped with egg whites. It was a heavy and spicy drink (and amazing) so we were predicting beef or pork for the next course. The third course was pork belly topped by a poached egg and served on a chorizo aioli with Mexican spiced corn cut off the cob and a Blue Hound tater tot. I  was glad to see the tater tot, having read about Blue Hound's tater tots here, but my wife never would have ordered it. . In fact, it is here where I am relying on pictures and the third cocktail makes it a little fuzzy. Just the same, it was also amazing and we were stuffed at the end (yeah, we could have stopped and not eaten it all, but that was neigh impossible). 

Prior the fourth course we were presented with an espresso-based cold cocktail that had us guessing chocolate. The desert came after we had had time to let the prior three courses settle over conversation; not so soon as to rush us but not so late as to have us looking for the waiter. Desert was the only course where we received different dishes. I was given a pineapple upside down cake under medjool ice cream with salted carmel sauce (this was the only item of the evening that I later saw on the menu). My wife was given some sort of flour-less chocolate cake with a salted carmel sauce and ... well, I forget the rest. The pineapple upside down cake was just so good. She ate half of my desert and we both had far more than we should have. We both liked her desert, but the pineapple upside-down cake with the carmel and ice cream what just right. 

The dinner came in under $200 for the two of us including tip. To be honest, I'd expected it to cost far more and, considering the quantity and quality of food and service we received, the price was a bargain. Blue Hound will definitely have us looking for excuses to come downtown again. I was happy we were staying at the Palomar so the right \"home\" was just an elevator ride. To do even just the three cocktails (ha! even just!) that came with the \"geek out\" experience I would definitely need a taxi or designated driver home. Thankfully the Hotel Palomar has fantastic summer rates and a room was less than the price of a car or taxi."}
{"text":"A very quaint, elegant and modernized farm to table with a southern touch type of bar/restaurant.  Really has a ton to offer with a great menu, drinks and outdoor seating.

The bartender Emily makes amazing drinks and was so nice to us."}
{"text":"I made a reso on opentable for a father's day get together for 7. When I found out an 8th would be joining, called the restaurant and my call was answered promptly and I was informed that it would be no problem at all to add another person to the party.

The food was great. Deviled eggs were delicious, salmon + shrimp was great, salmon cooked medium-ish so it was super moist, chopped salad was good (but not as good as The Gladly's) and the drinks were fun and experiential (one came with tobacco smoke)

Daniel Jimenez was our server and he was outstanding. Great with recos, very friendly, and took photos of our group per our request, even though he had a busy section.

Only downfall may be the prices as they seem somewhat high vs similar restaurants.

All in all a great night with great food and seamless, outstanding service."}
{"text":"We were invited to an event here. It had a fix menu available. The food itself was ok. Our water was regularly filled up by the nice waiters. They took our order of the entree and desert. There were two long tables outside and when they started serving the salads, which did have enough dressing, they seemed to be too slow and I got my salad by the time my neighbor was already done with his. All entrees looked pretty good and also tasted good. I had the herb chicken, was a bit too dry, and my husband had the steak. I m glad it was all served outside since it appeared to be very noisy inside. Will I come back? Most likely not."}
{"text":"My go to place in Downtown Phoenix for business lunches or special occasions. Great food that changes with the seasons, there's always something different on the menu. Friendly and knowledgeable staff that never disappoints."}
{"text":"Loved the food at this place. The only problem was the wait. My boyfriend and I had a reservation and it still took about 15-20 minutes to get seated. I recommend the roasted cauliflower, ceviche tacos and the chocolate creme brûlée."}
{"text":"When the cats at Cityscape want a posh drink and food, no better place than the Hound. Thanks Blue Hound for the many years of grand service and food. Get your Hound on."}
{"text":"An absolutely foodie's heaven - loved everything about this restaurant - the decor, the service, the imaginative menu, the cocktails (oh! the cocktails!!!) - all top notch...

Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and we will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"I ended up at Blue Hound after deciding we'd rather have a nice dinner than go to a Suns game.  Without a reservation we weren't really expecting to get seated right away but the hostess was great and was able to get us seated.  

The service here is fantastic.  Our waiter was great and she was never hovering or too far away.  The food was paced out perfectly as well.

The food was very good.  We started with the fried green tomatoes which were served with a generous portion of crab meat.  I don't think I'd get this again though.  Don't get me wrong, I like crab meat but tomatoes weren't very good and were too thinly cut and for $15, you can do better.

Our entrees were the pork shank and the shrimp and grits.  The shanks was good and the fennel sausage and beans it came with might have been better than shank itself.  The shrimp and grits was creamy and delicious as well.  

The cocktails were interesting and very well made so all around this was a great meal.  Docking 1 star because $125 for two people didn't really equate to what we received.  While everything was good, it was overpriced by 15-25%"}
{"text":"I ate here last night and ordered the blackened salmon. Although it tasted great, the center of the salmon was undercooked. I woke up with serious stomach issues this morning. I am certain I'm experiencing food poisoning from the salmon."}
{"text":"Was not disappointed at all. Everything was perfect. Loved the vibes,dimly lit and music not overly loud. I went for a GNO but definitely will be back for date nite. The cocktails omaggghh there is definitely thought and effort put in the drink menu. The food was excellent. Shrimp and grits and the pork shank."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for brunch for the first time with some friends and I was overall happy with the place. The hotel and place have a really cool decor (modern industrial), but in my opinion, the food was nothing special. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, but they had red beans in them and I finished it fine, but I was starving and it wasn't to die for by any means. My girlfriend got the egg Benedict, but I didn't try it. I asked her how it was and she said that it was \"good\", so, she didn't complain, but she didn't seem impressed either. They actually forgot one of our guests meals, which wasn't cool. We were pretty much done eating when he got his plate and they didn't offer to comp the meal or even provide a discount. We didn't ask because to us, it is a given, but they obviously didn't think so (or they forgot)... My friend got the chicken and waffles and I did have some of that. The waffles were soggy and the fried chicken was OK. Nothing compared to the real thing.

Let me get to the point: Should you go there or not? Well, as I mentioned before, the decor is really cool, which makes me think that it could be fun for a quick drink before you go somewhere else. I wouldn't recommend it for brunch, but I would be willing to try them out again for lunch or dinner. 

FYI: Their unlimited mimosas and bloody marry's are priced at $13 during brunch, which isn't bad."}
{"text":"I just landed in Phoenix for a few days, and since this is my very first time I wanted to kick it off with some good food.  After looking around on yelp, I found that this promising restaurant is in my very own hotel, so I figured what better way to start my trip than with some nice smoked meat.

The pulled pork on the menu seemed like the thing for me, but as I was talking to the waiter he mentioned that their burger was just voted the best in Phoenix.  I asked and he said that they grind their own meat.  So, never being one to turn down a good burger, I figured that would be a great start.  After the fact, I realize the fatal flaw in my plan was that I never asked if Phoenix was known for it's burgers...

I ordered an iced tea, and a burger (rare) with an over-easy egg on top.  Here are the details:

First, the iced tea is not very good as far as iced tea goes.  I asked the first server (not my waiter) if it was fresh brewed before I ordered it, and he said yes.  However, what came was a cloudy, bitter, iced tea that usually indicates that it came from a mix, or concentrate.

Second, my first burger arrived (yes, first).  Normally, I don't send food back, but it was REALLY SALTY. My lips were burning after the first bite. Beyond that, it was cooked medium or medium well.  I don't honestly know the difference when it gets that cooked.  It was chewy though.

Third, my second burger arrived.  It was seasoned well, but still overcooked.  It was dry and chewy.  Even the egg didn't make it better.  Maybe it would be good for someone who likes their burgers more well-done.  The bacon was good though.

Overall, I think they probably pre-cook their burgers and then heat them up to serve, as that would explain why they can't cook them to order.

The service was good.  I liked my waiter, and the manager did ask if he could bring me anything else, but I learned long ago not to go for a third try.  So, the two stars is not for the service, it is for the food."}
{"text":"Good service and a good amount of liquor in my drink. Great bar menu as well. Relaxing place to grab food and drinks."}
{"text":"Went here last night expecting to love it. I got there around 9 and it was very crowded and lively. Whoever designed the bar/lounge area did a great job as it creates a killer atmosphere. I had one drink and left- was unimpressed with the drink and thought it wasn't worth the $11 and 10 minutes I had to wait to order and receive it. 

Might try Blue Hound again in the future, just not on a Friday night and not whatever gin cocktail I had last night."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing! Really friendly waitress and the food came out on time. This place is rustic yet elegant. I had the chopped salad which was super yummy and filling. It had tomatoes, corn, avocado, sunflower seeds and something crunchy that weren't croutons. I loved the different textures and flavor. My friends had the ribs and the coconut curry. I tried both and they were amazing. The curry reminded me of Thai food. It came with a tempura pea and carrot that you dip with the curry. AMAZING. The ribs were a little spicy, I could taste the tabasco sauce. My friend couldn't handle the spice but I thought it was good. Overall, I would highly recommend this place. The flavors, decor and menu makes this restaurant different."}
{"text":"Great meal - some unusual veggie options. Brussel Sprout Caesar was truly original and tasty. Roasted squash with barley and golden raisins was delightful. When I ordered the cheese platter for dessert, however, the cheese was ice cold and not presented in an appetizing way. The fig preserves looked like it was scooped out of a vat with a deformed ice cream spoon. The grapes were tasteless. The cheese was gross."}
{"text":"Brand new to AZ and tried Blue Hound for the first time tonight.  Vibe inside was very chill and relaxed. 6 of ya sat for dinner and cocktails.  Our server was extremely friendly and patient with us and had great recommendations. Best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had!!!!  Easy to park close by.  I'll definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"So glad my friend recommended this place!! From the amazing service I received when my party of 2 became a party of 8 to the actual dinner service, I was impressed. The cocktails were delicious (I ordered the war of the roses). Dinner was also delicious (the pork shank). Tender cut of pork and the fennel sausage tossed in the rice & beans was rich and full of flavor. I will definitely return! Is vday too soon to come back?"}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. The shrimp and grits is a must. Definitely a good place all around. The atmosphere and staff wonderful"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a Diamondback's game with several other patrons and sat up at the bar. We weren't notified the kitchen was closed until we tried to place an order for food, after we already placed a drink order. The Bloody Mary left a lot to be desired - no spice, no kick, no lime or lemon wedge, and no olives. Very plain Bloody Mary that cost $12. Not worth the price. I'll head back because I want to give this place a decent shot but based off of my first impression I wouldn't recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband for brunch. We ordered the chilaquiles and biscuits and gravy with coffee. The food was good and the coffee was particularly good. Our friend joined us shortly after our food arrived and also ordered chilaquiles. This shouldn't have been an issue since our food came out quickly. But, after 35 min of waiting he canceled his order. Apparently the waitress put the order in, but the cook overlooked it."}
{"text":"So I met some friends here last night for cocktails. We sat at the bar. The bartender, Juan C,  was AWFUL!!! Ordered a bottle of champagne and he didn't even put it on ice. He gave us dirty looks all night and went out of his way to ignore us. Worst service I have ever had and we still gave him 20%. The food was good but if you ever go here and you have him as a server then LEAVE!!! It was that bad. I don't think I can ever go back after that. Shame, I have always liked this place."}
{"text":"Despite reservation for five people,  seated in bar area with drinkers hovering around the table.  The manager was completely unhelpful,  and dining experience for all of us was terrible.  There are far better choices in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The experience started off well enough, but it then became really frustrating. I enjoyed a happy hour drink with a snack, tasty, at the bar and had a nice positive, service experience. The staff at the bar had expanded when I decided that I was too tired to head elsewhere for a full meal. My new server became a serious downer. After being ignored for a while, I grabbed his attention and asked about specials for the evening. There were none, but for any other server, that question would have been an indicator that this particular customer was highly serious about ordering dinner. No, apparently not. 

This guy went around and paid attentive service to every male at the bar, getting drinks, following up with proactive questions about whether they would like to order dinner, asking how their, insert food/drink here, were. Unlike me, these people were not clutching their menus. The bartender closed them out while I sat. It was unbelievable. All the while, I'm there with the darn menu, giving the look, and hoping to order. 

After the various male patrons left for their dinners elsewhere or finished their drinks, he turned to me. I ordered some dinner. I was furious. The ONLY reason I stayed was that I had had a busy day and hadn't had a chance to eat lunch. I was really hungry. Going elsewhere would have taken too long. By the time my food arrived, and the, more with it bartender, asked the obligatory questions, all I could offer were clipped responses while thinking, \"get me out of here. I deserve better.\" I choked down the meal, paid, and left. 

Here's what I'll say. Women travel. Women need to eat. Women sit at the bar to do those things, eat, drink, and relax, like any other travelers. Don't make us second class citizens.  My experience might have been due to one server's unconscious bias, but it sucked and it colored an otherwise positive experience."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner her before a show we were seeing. We had drinks here before but this was our first time having the food and man it was good. We ordered the tater tots and deviled eggs to start. The tots were so good, we wished we ordered the larger size. They had bits of bacon in them and to be honest, they were a bit of a salt bomb but in a really good way. The deviled eggs were delicious and creamy and some of my favorites I've ever had. For dinner we split the pork belly flat bread/pizza thingy. YUM -the caramelized onions with the salt bite from the pork - it was delicious. I would definitely go back here again for drinks and most certainly for the food!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner while on a trip to AZ. They had a nice location in a small mall area, near the light rail line, and the atmosphere was upscale without being too formal or snobby. I didn't think we'd need to call in advance since this wasn't a super-busy area, but apparently they were almost booked solid that night. Fortunately they had a cancellation, so after about 30 minutes in the cocktail lounge/reception area, they were able to accommodate us with a table. Both the drink and food menu were adventurous and tantalizing, without being too \"weird\". Our waiter was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and really got to know our tastes before recommending some dishes, which we loved! The food was all cooked and presented well and the service was excellent.
It can get a little loud and the tables are close together due to the limited seating area, so I wouldn't take a large group or a romantic date here.
Obviously my caution would be to make reservations in advance as the dining room is very small. Additionally, I would not take a non-foodie here as the expense would be wasted on someone who doesn't appreciate food fusion and artistry."}
{"text":"We came here for a late night dinner and quite enjoyed ourselves.  The restaurant was only about 2/3 full but it was very loud and the atmosphere was a mix of people like us dressed casually and people dolled up.  By the time we left, however, it was pretty empty.  

We had a bit of a hard time ordering, and the weird thing was the huge variance in the portion sizes.  For four of us we ordered the bottomless popcorn, the large BBQ'd Kobe beef short rib, the tater tots, Dinasaur kale salad, roasted cauliflower, a special flatbred, the large jerk cured fish.  We also had a heirlooms tomato salad that the waiter gave us because someone had messed up an order.  Everything was actually really tasty, but the beef short ribs dominated the meal in terms of portion size while the tater tots and the fish were really tiny in size.  Food came out at a pace that wasn't rushed and allowed us to talk and enjoy ourselves.  My only other complaint was that there were a large number of things that they were out of (both on the bar menu and the food menu).  I'd definitely come back here, but I'd really rather someone else paid."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner, a little too keen on itself.  Average cocktails, average food and average service. charisma bybass in my opinion."}
{"text":"My 1st time in Phoenix and this is the 1st place I chose to eat at. And my my my am I satisfied with this restaurant. From being greeted right when I walked in, the beautiful bar, the restaurant set up, the music, the vibes. The restaurant is modern with a rustic feel. Loved all the wood. My server Daniel was AMAZING! He was so genuine, friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable about ALL the menu items, as well as the area. He also suggested a few cool bars in the area to check out which was really helpful. I ate the deviled eggs and the BLT w/salad, the ahi tuna, brussel sprouts, flatbread and sliders. Didn't wait long for the food at all and the food was QUALITY. On top of having a great experience, as I just left the restaurant I ran into a gentlemen wearing a blue hound uniform outside, his name was Logan. And he is one of the sou chefs. I told him the food was sooo good, and we chatted a bit. He was nice and told me to come back, so I came back that evening with my friend once she landed. I enjoyed both times eating here, 5 stars across the board. Thank you Blue Hound for your hospitality...I will be back! :)

{"text":"My husband and I had an early dinner before going to the symphony. We had a great time. Danny took care of us graciously and with a good sense of humor. It's a great very open place; it's in the Paloma's, which caters to a seriously hip crowd. We both had a the Lawless bourbon cocktail flavored with tobacco smoke. It was excellent, but I guess I can't say I've never smoked anymore. We split the shishito peppers which were great. Ric had the roasted beet salad - amazing presentation and taste. I had the Kale salad which was great. I tried the shrimp and grits - my grandmother from Louisiana would have been pleased. Ric had a steak, which he thought was perfect. No room for dessert, but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was prepared to like the place.  The atmosphere was great, busy urban vibe, views of Cityscape (the ice skating helped), very different than the normal for a Valley restaurant.  The liquor choice were impressive, but the martinis were skimpy.  The service was spotty, at times a bit intrusive, at others, hard to find the waiter.  We sampled two appetizers.  The pulled pork johnny cakes were wonderful, the tater tots  not so much (they were more like hush puppies in texture).  I had the BBQ'D Kobe Beef Short Ribs for the entree and my dining companion had the New England Diver Scallops.  The ribs were quite tasty and went well with the bleu cheese grits, but were a bit fatty.  The scallops were a tad too salty and had some grit or shell.  Willing to try the place again because we enjoyed the environment, and this is a decent achievement for a downtown restaurant in a hotel, but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"This place was ok .

Came in because we were looking for a good cocktail while we were in town.  The cocktail was pretty good.  But the atmosphere was a little off.  The bartender was ok , was quick to make the drink and take our cards.  Didn't want to start a conversation or ask about what were in the mood for .  Which is something simple to do , that I get most of the time when I go to cocktail bars.  Just a simple customer service thing that I appreciate.  


Again the drink was good .  But the place just didn't seem to have an identity .  I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Blue Hound located in the Palomar hotel just below Lustre is a great place for a romantic evening. The location shares the second floor lobby of the hotel and has a unique ambiance that seamlessly blends semi casual and white table cloth. 

This visit was a returning trip. I had written a comment on here and was contacted by the managing owner of the company. They had reached out to us with great customer service and invited us back. I asked them if they could offer us a romantic dinner for two on the house. The owner happily responded well provide the dinner but you have to bring the romance! 

They treated us to a great meal. Me and my partner had the chance to try out a wide selection of the menu and it was an overall fun and enjoyable experience. I would happily come back here. 

This location does have free wifi, so its not only great for dates but great for casual after work drinks or even just lounging around."}
{"text":"When I saw the name of this establishment, Blue Hound, I couldn't help but thing of the paintings of George Rodrigue, who is from Louisiana and in fact, this downtown based eatery has a distinctive New Orleans feel with its focus on cocktails (according to drinking lore the Big Easy is where the first cocktail, the Sazerac, was reportedly developed), and its Southern friendly food such as bone-in Kobe beef short ribs and grits and Kentucky fried quail with cornbread, red beans and gravy. At the same time the decor and the initial impression was like walking into a bar as good as any as one might find in New York City, this place has cool atmosphere in spades and just for that it is worth a visit.

I was going to to the opera (for the first time, yep, an opera virgin, who would have thought!) with some friends so we picked this place to eat at first. I had ridden the light rail from Tempe and you get off the stop at Washington and Central and literally, you are right there, so this place is extremely light rail friendly. You go to the building on the corner of Jefferson and Central and up to the 2nd floor, turn to your right and you are there! The opening leads into a long bar and the best part of this place, which is the cocktails. They must have a cocktail ice machine because the ice cubes are huge and perfect for drinks like the old fashioned as they keep the liquor cold but don't water down the drink and the old fashioned, I got it for the happy hour price of $6 and that is great deal. They have a whole book of cocktails and I haven't seen anything like this since I was in San Francisco earlier this year, which is sort of a cocktail renaissance mecca.  From what I saw Blue Hound can hold its own. If you just want to come for cocktails - 5 starts

Dinner, well, they seem to be trying but needs some work. It was noted that we needed to get the opera by 7:30 but the waiter seemed a bit aimless at times relative to keeping us on schedule and one of my dining companions was quite concerned that we would not have time to finis the meal. Luckily, there was a wonderful young lady who checked on us, and got our orders taken so that helped keep things running smoothly. For an appetizer, we had the duck confit flat-bread which came out wonderful hot and topped with arugula and green apple diced through a mandolin, it was delicious though two of my dining companions felt it needed more confit. 

We then did a salad and vegetable and i had a small dish of roasted cauliflower with pistachios, capers, and brown butter, and I thought it was quite good though I would have liked the cauliflower a little more roasted but nice - at this point, a solid 4 stars. 

As for the meals, three of us ordered the Kentucky fried quail and while it was okay, it did not come hot, the fried quail was room temperature, the gravy was not all that warm and the cornbread, almost cold and it was little bland. It was the blah part of my meal. Another person had scallops and though large and cooked perfectly she noted they needed some sort of sauce, also a bland dish. Finally, one person got the Kobe bone in rib, the half order, with the blue cheese grits, now that came out hot and it was good - so at this point - because of the slower than expected service from the primary waiter, and the fact that the main dish was blah - the overall agreement by my group of five (mixed group, men and women), was a solid 3 stars though if you just came for cocktails and appetizers (and they have a good list of starters) then we would rate it a solid 4 starts with 5 star potentials if they work on the operational workflow of the kitchen to get the food out hot.

Oh, one final point, I could not figure out how to work  the salt and pepper shakers, the waiters might want to point out how those work. Bottom line, I probably won't go back for a full meal here but I will come back in a heartbeat for the wonderful cocktail and drink selection and the small plates, which may be the way to go. In my mind, this is about the closest  thing to a cool cocktail bar, like you might find in New York or San Francisco, that one is going to find and the location off of the light rail and big events in downtown Phoenix can't be beat and yes, I'm already looking forward to my next old fashioned at the bar!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere was wonderful and the service was excellent.  the food, not a flavorful as i  would have liked, for the price. a good place for an afterwork drink but thats it."}
{"text":"In general I was a bit disappointed dispite the friendly service. Went for anniversary ,nice atmosphere but thought homemade pasta was dry and bland.  Limited menu and over priced food. This place is more suited for happy hour and group events rather than a quite dinner."}
{"text":"NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party.  We couldn't get a drink at the bar due to stressed out waitresses and a very crowded bar.  So we went downstairs for a drink at 12:30.  We were told that they already had last call and they were'nt making any more drinks!  Seriously, it's New Year's Eve! Plus the staff was rude and ignored people and talked to people they knew.  Really bad customer service especially if you wanted to impress guests and keep they're interest.  Blue Hound, you didn't succeed.  Hope you try better in the future."}
{"text":"Really great place for new age american cuisine. You walk in and there's this great sculpture of a blue hound.  Then you're seated and the menu is seasonally appropriate. The flavors are well balanced and presentation is great. I went with some friends and we shared the deviled eggs, shishito peppers, and seared ahi salad.  I love that there are large windows as well as an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Hmm, where to start....

Walking in, was greeted by a friendly hostess and place has a modern/rustic feel which I enjoyed.  I ordered a Bloody Mary to start and it was pretty good.  Had good spice to it, wasn't too heavy on the tomato juice side. Good flavor and simple, didn't come with an entire salad bar which I don't care for so that was a plus.   

For the food: I ordered the chicken and waffles. While they weren't bad there definitely wasn't anything special either.  Overall they just lacked flavor.  If you've had LoLos before these do not even come close.  Just bland over all.  To me the best thing on the plate that had the most flavor was the syrup.   

Service was good so no complaints there.  While I would give this place one more chance I wouldn't order the same thing again.  It is on the pricey side so I guess I expected more a punch for the price.   

If you do come I'd say perhaps temper any expectations you may have and just take it as it is."}
{"text":"Overall I liked this bar and will for sure go back.  The food was unique and the service was \"as expected\" given the recent opening and a quite busy bar.  The drink selection was vast and both of my drinks were unique and tasty.  I was horribly distracted by one of the bartenders (who was called the \"master mixologist\" within her earshot by our adorable bartender who looked like Sandra Bullock).  It seemed she had developed the cocktail list, which was impressive, but witnessing her snooty attitude and condescending interactions with the staff, my drink suddenly tasted as bitter as her personality."}
{"text":"The drinks!  The drinks!

This place just surpassed Sidebar as my go-to place for fancy-pants cocktails.  The absinthe fizz (gin, absinthe, lime, honey, soda and a HUGE strip of cucumber) might just be the best cocktail I've ever tried. Anywhere. Sadly, it's not included on the happy hour menu.  Get it anyway.

Happy hour features select $6 cocktails (the summer smash was, well, a smash) and half-price flatbreads.  My friends noted, however, that the happy hour flatbreads were considerably smaller than the $12 standard we got later that night!

Ask for Zack - he's young, he's cute, and, I can't believe I'm putting \"best\" into one review twice, but he honestly gave the BEST service I've ever received at a restaurant - hustling to get us several rounds before happy hour closed (He even went the extra mile by rounding up an ice bucket so that the last-ditch happy hour beer ($3)  - ordered while a half-full beer sat in front of us - wouldn't get warm!).

What a very happy happy hour, indeed."}
{"text":"I had a superior experience at the blue hound. not only was the service impeccable, but the food was insanely good and well-balanced. the atmosphere was upscale without being stiff. I loved the high ceilings and the large, comfortable low booth.

the waiter was very knowledgable about both the regular menu and the cocktail menu and he made sure my friend and I were comfortable without obsessively checking on us. as for the food, we started with an order of corn grit fries (they came so fast!) which were subtly spicy but soo flavorful. our drinks followed shortly afterwards - the blueprint and a brazilian manhattan... delicious. next, we both had the beet salad - perfectly balanced with goat cheese, dates, arugula and tangerine. I love beet salads and this one was the best I've ever had, hands down. I'd come back for that salad alone. as for entrées, I had the arctic char and my friend had the trout. both dishes were, again, well balanced. the unexpected combination of olives and citrus in the arctic char dish was particularly pleasant.

finally, for dessert we had the pineapple upside down cake with date ice cream. I don't usually go for this sort of thing but it was insanely good. served in a cast iron dish with just the right amount of salty caramel sauce.... wow.

this place really stands out from other similarly priced dining options in phoenix. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hi fives to Kimpton and Hotel Palomar for bringing The Blue Hound to downtown!

I have finally found a spot (without having to drive to Scottsdale)  where I can get a truly wonderful Old Fashioned with a large block ice cube.  The décor is awesome, hip and elegant with beautiful lighting.  They have a very long wooden bar that I haven't been able to move past so I can't really comment on the dining room. 

I am not sure why everyone keeps mentioning small portions... I have had several dishes and I didn't think they were small. Quite frankly I think Americans are overfed and used to large portions that could easily feed 3 people from one plate. Either way I ordered the ham steak and eggs and my friend got the KFC Sandwich and they were both HUMONGOUS!  In fact the ham steak  was the size of the entire plate! We both ended up taking half our meal home. I have also tried the flatbreads, the tots, the deviled eggs... All unique, distinct and palate pleasing. 

They do a great happy hour and the bartenders are awesome. This is my new favorite spot in Cityscape."}
{"text":"I was here for a private event so I cant really review their menu but I must say that even tho the event was hosted by a third party, their staff was really friendly. The place has high ceilings and feels really open which i really liked."}
{"text":"I'd love to be able to give a glowing review, as we've heard so many wonderful things from other people. Unfortunately, we arrived at 10:30PM looking to have cocktails and light snacks with a party of 6. We were not able to sit at a table because we were not all planning to order entrées, in spite of the fact that the restaurant was mostly empty. Poorly played Blue Hound... Poorly played."}
{"text":"Definitely a must do in the city. I learned about Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails in Phoenix Magazine's issue in the top chef's in the valley. And Executive Chef Stephen Jones was featured in the magazine. Great atmosphere, food, cocktails and decor. My husband and I got the Partner in Dine meal special which consists of 2 small appetizers, a sandwich and a salad. I highly recommend this meal special if it's your first time. It was cool seeing Chef Jones at the restaurant. I look forward to visiting Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty awesome.

\"Shrimp and Grits\" (5/5):
Pricey (~$27), but very tasty. Husband liked it a lot and I also liked it a lot! 

\"Short rib sliders (4 piece)\" (4/5):
$14... The ribs were really tender, but I felt like it lacked something. The horseradish sauce that was supposed to be in it didn't give it the 'hit' that I needed. A friend who ordered the same dish had to dip his sliders in BBQ sauce. I thought the Hawaiian roll tasted like your typical Hawaiian roll that can be bought at WalMart in those orange packages.

\"Pork Shank\" (4.5/5)
Very tender pork. Lots of beans. Friend liked it. Wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"Got the ahi quinoa cakes which were to DIE for. The grilled peppers were also amazing. My coconut cream vodka was pretty good too. Really nice waitress. I couldn't order any of the entrees because I'm vegan except with ahi. I'm sure at a place this nice the chef would've made me something special but I hate to be a bug. I got the pasta and it was okay, I don't love tomato but I think anyone else would enjoy it. Would've liked some bread for the table."}
{"text":"I've frequented Blue Hound Kitchen for many fantastic cocktails for happy hour. Their drinks are great. 

I was also under the impression that their fries were phenomenal, but I need to emphasize that the happy hour and dinner fries are phenomenal. They're actually what the menu described: thick cut, rosemary, Parmesan delights--perfectly crunchy outsides; soft, fluffy insides. However, if you go during lunch, you'll receive flimsy, salty shoestring fries. A disappointing fact I learned when seven coworkers and I decided to give Blue Hound a try for lunch. 

Do not try Blue Hound for lunch. Besides the sad fries (which the server took off our bill because of our resounding disappointment), the black quinoa salad was not made with black quinoa and it didn't appear to be much of a salad, more like a pilaf. It was also one of the blandest things I've ever had. And at the meal's end, the server tried to charge $10 per quinoa salad when the menu listed it at $9.

The piquillo pepper sandwich was just all right. The Chex mix appetizer lacked any Chex, and the pickled vegetables were less pickled and more just doused in vinegar. Other people at the table enjoyed the bison jerky and their oh-so-juicy looking burgers, but overall the vibe was \"meh.\" 

Their lunch special (two mini apps, salad, and sandwich for two people to split for $11/person) is a good deal. But even at that price, I was not blown away by the food. I would've hulk smashed something had I paid full price for anything. 

In short, the sad (and subsequently free) lunch fries were the best part of the meal. That's not good.

P.S. My friend wants me to mention that the bartender Dante is a great guy and should not in any way be related to this poor review."}
{"text":"We support LOCAL. After catching a show at Stand Up Live we walked across the street for a late dinner. Wow....the short rib and blues cheese grits were, as always amazing."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place but I just can't give it more than 3 stars.  I shouldnt have been so surprised for the cost of my meal but I have to say - I left the restaurant with buyer's remorse - I paid that for that?  The tater tots had such potential but needed a bit of something more. And I was disappointed with the Mac and Cheese portion and again the perception that something was missing to really take this dish over the top.  My husband loved his hamburger.  Tip:  If you are gloing to be known for your cocktails, please make sure you have the ingredients in stock."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once or twice but I always stop in for their cocktails. One of my favorite places downtown."}
{"text":"I almost cried during my meal here because Phoenix needs this restaurant SO BADLY.  It's hip and kind of elegant at the same time with stylized comfort food that's familiar but new at the same time.  

The cheddar scallion biscuits with bacon jam and a sunny side up quail egg...sublime!  Basil risotto was simply perfect and a great vegetarian option.  And while the lemon blueberry cheesecake was good, the accompanying tortilla ice cream changed my life; I could have eaten an entire plate of the ice cream alone.

Blue Hound is attached to the new Hotel Palomar, which is also well worth a visit, if only to see the ultra cool Arizona wing back chairs which I now want for my living room!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon (very small dish), corn (didnt care for it much), lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good, the cocktails and menu never fail to impress. The vibe can change from visit to visit based on tourism but the service, cocktails and menu are consistently awesome. I am premeditating my next visit as I type ;p"}
{"text":"It was a little easy to overlook, but distinctly classy, even compared to the rest of CityScape's watering holes. We stepped in and waited...and waited...staff looked at us and kept walking, as if we weren't hip enough to breathe the air in such an establishment. 

Don't make eye contact with customers who have just entered and then walk away. That's customer service you should have picked up at whatever previous jobs allowed you to land here. 

\"Maybe it's closing\", I muttered, looking at the hours posted on Yelp. \"They're still douchebags here.\"

Just before we were about to leave, your mustachioed mixologist from Michoacan swooped in to completely redeem this trendy bar. I am a gin man, not a whiskey guy, so I was totally lost regarding what to order. Good thing this is a bartender I can trust, I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of the \"Ours is the fury\" (strange name) that he recommended for my sweet tooth. I would have certainly tried more, but be careful! These are strong! It was a Monday night, and I had stuff to do in the morning.

But I'll be back, and I'm going to try several styles of whiskey. And recommend this place to my more manly, whiskey-loving friends. I find myself going out for a cocktail quite often nowadays. Between quality liquor and woody, classy decor, Blue hound totally deserves to see more of my business.

Oh, and there's food, too. I'll update you when I give that a try as well."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, nice spot wouldn't have found it but it was recommended to me! The new BHKC salad was perfect, my husband had a shrimp salad and enjoyed that too!"}
{"text":"The food was at the highest level. But bartenders are world class. They gave excellent recommendations for local beer and collected seemingly amazing cocktails for people around me."}
{"text":"Lots of style, but very little substance.

Blue Hound is apparently one of the \"best new restaurants\" in Phoenix. Yikes - our experience here just didn't live up to the considerable hype this place has generated.

Menu: the menu is...interesting. It looks like they took every foodie buzzword they could think of, wrote them on slips of paper and pulled out three or four for each dish. \"Hmm...we've got short ribs, and blue cheese aaaannd grits - great!\" I mean, what is foie gras cornbread???

Atmosphere: super stylish and well executed. It fits right in with the Palomar - upscale without being overly trendy.

Drinks: BH has an ambitious cocktail list and a decent wine list. I appreciate the inclusion of a decent sparkler by the glass. 

Presentation: just like the interior, the dishes here are beautiful. Everything that came out was perfectly plated and looked fresh and delicious.

Service: we had to wait almost 30 minutes past our reservation time, but BH comped us some drinks so that's cool. Our server did a fine job, considering they were very busy.

Food: here's where it falls apart. It doesn't matter if your joint is stylish, your servers are great and your dishes look like works of art unless it tastes good. And for the most part, our party of 6 said \"meh\". The sole exception was the giant short rib which fell off the bone and was truly exceptional. My flatbread was described as \" chorizo, fontina and arugala\". What I got was a giant cracker with a dusting of cheese, 3-4 tiny chorizo slices and about 5 arugala leaves. Two others ordered the cod and the reaction was \"well, that was...unusual\". 

Prices: expect to pay a premium for small portions.

I think Blue Hound has tons of potential, but unfortunately our experience here was not up to snuff. I'd pass Blue Hound by for the time being."}
{"text":"The best restaurant that we had in Downtown Phoenix. The ambiance is great, upscale, modern and innovative. The food is 15 stars on a scale of 1 - 10. The price point is exactly what you would expect for a restaurant of this caliber. You must make a reservation, we arrived around 7:30 pm on a Wednesday and they weren't able to seat us until after 8:30 pm. Lucky for us, there were two spots open at the bar. The staff is a very good looking bunch and have great attitudes! 

Appetizer: CORN GRIT FRIES smoked bacon, white cheddar, pomodoro - these were beyond amazing! They were basically like a mozzarella stick filled with yumminess!

Entree: PAPPARDELLE schreiner's sausage ragu - their pasta is phenomenal to say the least. This was a delicious place. 

I will DEFINITELY go back to Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails to enjoy more of what they have to offer!!"}
{"text":"Retarded drink menu. This place used to have wonderful drinks. They changed their menu to only photographs without any descriptions of what you're ordering. Even the waitresses have no clue then act annoyed when you ask for what's in the various drinks. Big waste of time they ruined a previously good dining experience. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"We were refused by the hostess with over half of the tables and booths being empty. The gal was good at being argumental however her arguments were not powered by intelligence. After persuasion we we're finally sat at a table near the bar that had been marked \"reserved\" along with three others in the row. We proceeded to order cocktails that we're delicious and then a light dinner which was also quite flavorful. The rest of the staff was very friendly and accommodating as a service industry professional should be. We sat in the booth for 40 minutes and had a $78 tab. Upon departure the booth next to us was still empty and the one on the other side was empty about half way through our visit and remained so till we departed. I am unsure the logic still to this moment she was instilling but I must say we chose after being soured by her lack of service to venture caddy corner to Bitter and Twisted where the hostess was lovely as well as welcoming! Maybe she should train the hostesses over at the Blue Hound! The bartenders were skilled, the waitress was perfect and the food was good and hot! I feel the experience was very dulled by it's initial interaction that one star is where I could rate, but that would not be fair to the rest of the establishments personnel that did do a great job!"}
{"text":"It's 3 months after my initial review and the prosecco is still not chilled enough. What up????"}
{"text":"very nice vibe and setting... very friendly staff and knowledgeable of the menu. four of us ordered 7 dishes plus dessert, everything to share tapas style. love the unlimited warm nuts.., the peach salad is also quite excellent. sweet and fresh. the mussels are our favorite of the night. very nice flavor, saffron adds depth and beautiful color to the dish. make sure you ask for extra bread to dip in that delicious broth! not very impressed by the scallop ceviche taco... the taco shell was too big and thick proportionally. wish there were more ceviche in the taco and had more juice in it. the Kentucky quail is okay. was imagining it to be a whole one. the pineapple upside down cake is the bomb! definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Really attractive environment, attentive staff, great food- I have lunch here almost once a week.  Everything we have tried on the menu has been very tasty - although I have a tendency to go back for the Blue Hound Burger again, and again, and again.  My REAL favorite though is the popcorn - it is caramelly and spicy all together - FANTASTIC.  Our favorite server, Daniel, brings it to us every week with our Arnold Palmers, the minute we walk in the door.  Does not get much better than that!!!"}
{"text":"I first got to know this place through a room service delivery while staying at Palomar. After that it became my go to place. The ambiance is pleasant, the service is always good, drinks are made well and food is delicious. I've tried many things off of their menu, but most memorable are shrimp and grits, picnic ribs, kale salad, beet salad (not offered since July) and seated tuna. Come for happy hour to enjoy very inexpensive drinks and try their well made cocktails."}
{"text":"What a beautiful, sexy restaurant!

I came here on Friday night with my three dear friends for a much needed, relaxing dinner out.  We decided to use the 20% Yelp discount voucher I received the night before at the Summer Splash and Dash event, and as soon as we were seated I gave our waiter, Chris, my Yelp discount card.

We ordered drinks and I was a little overwhelmed by the large cocktail menu.  Not overwhelmed in a bad way, but overwhelmed in a good way...it was enormous!  My friends all ordered their own drinks and we placed an appetizer orders: the \"endless\" caramel popcorn with Ancho chilies, and half orders each of the tater tots and the seasoned Kennebec French fries.  The tater tots and fries were both hot and delicious and came with tangy dipping sauce.  The caramel popcorn was intriguing with its slightly spicy end note.  We really enjoyed the popcorn, but sadly while the menu description implied it was a refillable menu item, it wasn't refilled when we depleted the bowl and so we only got a very small serving.

After finishing our first cocktails we all placed our dinner orders, I ordered the large order of the Kobe beef short ribs with the blue cheese grits, my girlfriends both ordered flatbread pizzas and a salad and our lone male companion ordered the lamb meatballs.  We also ordered additional cocktails to go with dinner and I took the chance to order a drink the waiter recommended called a Bermuda Triangle, which was cold, fruity, tangy and massively potent too.  (Wow!)

Our dinners all trickled out at different times and us three ladies at the table had all been served for a full 15 minutes before we eventually grabbed the closest waiter in the vicinity, Justin, and had him check on our companion's missing lamb meatballs.  Justin happily obliged our request and disappeared into the kitchen only to reappear with the lamb meatballs in less than 30 seconds.  How long they were sitting there waiting to be delivered to our table was anyone's guess.  Sadly our own waiter wasn't aware of this hitch because he never came near our table that whole time.  I knew there was a problem though when the people who came in a full 30 minutes after we were seated had been served their food (including an order of lamb meatballs) and the three of us ladies had all been served and our friend was still waiting for his entree!

After everyone finally had their food we all started to eat and I wasn't at all disappointed with my Kobe beef ribs!  They were so generously sized I could only eat one, however the grits were utterly unremarkable and I basically ignored them in favor of that massive, meaty rib.  I also tasted the lamb meatballs and they were fabulous, although the hot pink sour cream they were served with was a bit oddly colored.

Not long after we finished eating our waiter reappeared and he volunteered to clear our table and package the second, untouched Kobe beef rib for me.  We also placed dessert orders and chatted while we waited for dessert to appear.  Oddly our desserts, including my Panna Cotta and my friend's seasonable sorbets, were all served with forks.  I had to ask the waiter for spoon instead.  My Panna Cotta was a tad too soft for my liking, but the pool of foamy citrus sauce it was sitting in was very good and deliciously tangy, although to be quite honest I could have done without the flavorless, unidentifiable curls that topped the Panna Cotta.  Seriously, I couldn't even identify what they were, they were that tasteless.

We paid our tab and tipped our waiter on the pre-discount amount.  (It should be noted that we would have tipped him more, but leaving us to sit for 15 minutes as our dinners cooled and we politely waited for our companion's missing dinner entree was no bueno!)

So all in all this was a pleasant dining experience and I expect will venture back soon, but next time I'd love to have more follow up from our waiter and I'd hope that all the entrees all arrive around the same time too."}
{"text":"This place is great, food was good, the drinks are excellent. The peaches and cream were a great way to end the dinner. Greg at the bar was amazing with his recommendations and charming personality!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place in Cityscape downtown Phoenix. I would surely make this a regular happy hour spot if I worked down here. My sister wanted me to try their Outlaw bourbon drink - but they had just taken it off the menu. Too bad too. Sounds amazing with smoke and bitters. Happy hour has good drink specials, but a limited bar menu. We enjoyed house chardonnay with an order of unlimited seasoned popcorn, while husband opted for a heartier burger from the bar menu. The burger smelled fantastic and he did say it was good, except for the really thick slice of velveeta on it. Great if you like that sort of thing. Burger comes with fries, on a toasted bun with crispy bacon. 
We stayed for a couple drinks and headed out. It was a Monday afternoon, just before rush hour. Not a big place but comfortable. 
Great place for a business meeting, or upscale stop for a classy drink with co-workers."}
{"text":"Came her to wind down after a busy day on a Saturday night.  I had been to this spot with friends about 6 months ago and wanted to give it another shot.  Sure glad I did. The bartenders were great and very attentive - you could tell they really wanted to make sure everyone was taken care of at the bar.  Then have a great selection of bourbons - I went with Blantons and Hudson Baby Bourbon.  Got a little hungry later and ordered the shrimp and grits which were outstanding - the shrimp, andouille sausage, grits, everything was on point.  Saved half of it for the next day.  This place does a nice job and they seem to only be getting better.  Will return soon!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

How much do I miss Chef Stephen Jones here?  A lot.  Since coming here from the first week it opened to my last visit last night and from every visit in between, something's gone missing from this place.

None of the food we had last night was bad.  The cocktails here are still very good and might bump it up to 4 stars, but I can't quite yet.

We ordered deviled eggs and boudin balls for appetizers.  The deviled eggs were filled with a bacon jam that was dry, inelegant at best.  But it all tasted fine together.  The boudin balls were filled with appeared more to be pulled pork than boudin.  I've had amazing boudin in Washington DC at DBGB Kitchen and some great boudin balls in New Orleans - these fell way short.  But again, tasted fine.

We got the chopped salad.  it was huge.  Almost too huge.  It is a heavy, heavy salad.  It's a riff on the chopped salad from The Gladly/Citizen Public House.  Dried corn for nice sweet crunch, lots of fregula for some chew and weight, avocados, romaine, heirloom plum tomatoes.  The dressing was a little heavy and every was just a tad . . . heavy.  

Wife got the handmade pasta with some vegetables in a marinara sauce.  It was on the soft side of al dente, just shy of being overcooked.  But, as with everything else we tasted, it tasted \"fine.\"

This place has lost its pizzazz.  The service was great, there was a loud bachelorette party going on but that's not a regular thing, and the food was, unfortunately, nothing to write home about.

We miss the old Blue Hound.  Hoping they can bring back some of the magic."}
{"text":"This is a great place to start the night off before going to dinner or going to an event downtown. I'm a huge fan (and critic) of negronis and they make one of my top 5 in the city. They have a great assortment of craft cocktails on their menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful bar and hotel ... but skip it for happy hour and watch out for deceptive wait staff.

Problem with the Blue Hound is there are too many choices nearby to make coming back a possibility. It may feel cool, but a lot of other places nearby feel cool, too. It's worth a visit just to check it out, but then ... it will never enter your mind again.

The Whoohoos!! - Beautifully decorated, great feeling and vibe, as another reviewer stated. It feels like a nice change of pace for Phoenix restaurants. The poolside bar is awesome and I'd go back there before this place.

The Sad Pandas - Happy hour SUCKS. I work nearby and go out at least one night a week and the Blue Hound will not be on our rotation list. \"But why?\" you ask ...

Set the scene ... four women out after work. Not looking for dinner, just some snacks while we have a drink or two and catch up.

Popcorn - sounds nummy! Not if you want more than two handfuls. For $6, we were delivered a teeny, tiny wooden bowl that you'd expect salsa to come in. In it was two medium sized handfuls of this caramel popcorn (and a lot of kernels and broken pieces). This should be given to the table gratis, if you're going to give something so small.

Deviled eggs - Wow, the presentation was beautiful I felt like Gordon Ramsey must have perfectly placed and spaced the eggs on the plate. And the four of us, now totally stuffed from our half a handful of popcorn stare down at three deviled eggs. Good thing Maria was on a diet, of else we'd have to arm wrestle for who got the eggs.

Drinks - not the worse priced, not the best. Problem was our waiter didn't seem to have a Fing clue about their unique lineup of beers. I asked for something light and summery - to which he suggest a \"summer shandy.\"

Assuming this summer shandy was the same as every other summer shandy I've had (beer mixed with lemonade), I agreed to try it on the waiter's \"It's amazing\"

What I was given haunts me in my dreams. A oddly shaped beer glass was delivered with a light, almost water color and a GIANT FREAKING CUCUMBER stuck in it. 

Was I supposed to put this on my eyes? The drink smelled like a combination of facial moisturizer and salad ... both appealing combos in a drink.

That's about when my friend found the drink in their table top menu and pointed out the $10 price tag and list of liquor. This was NOT a normal summer shandy and the waiter should have told me and either pointed to it in the menu and listed the price. Granted, $10 isn't horrible, but what if I was watching my money?  When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip, be honest with me or I'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.

So bottom line ... I think this place is worth a visit, but given my experience, I will not be returning on any regular basis."}
{"text":"I had the Cod fish Po' Boy sandwich, it was yummy and thier fries have  a spicy kick to them.  I really like the urban look of this restaurant.... I'll be back."}
{"text":"I think whenever I come downtown for an event I end up here to close out my night. The atmosphere and overall vibe suits my likings and the appetizers/ drinks come with a bit of flare that stand above your basics eats.

It's located in the Palomar Hotel off the upper deck level so people get a bit confused. If you don't come thru the hotel, escalators are on the side to take u up a level so look for the great big ol doors to the entrance

One particular appetizer is my ultimate favorite here and that's the BHKC deviled eggs... these jokers are so damn good i find myself getting 2 or 3 orders because I'm sharing my 1st order with friends and hogging the last one!!! After our group had the deviled eggs (and a few Moscow Mules in) I headed to the kitchen to inquire on the preparation and serving. The manager and kitchen crew were friendly and I let them know how much it was appreciated. 

If your looking for a little low key spot for apps & conversation, head over to the BH 

Haven't done dinner here yet so looking forward to trying in the future."}
{"text":"Me and husband have fallen in love with the bar right away -  classical and new/innovative hand muddled cocktails & FUN ambiance was a recipe for perfect Friday evening. Slowly venturing into food menu - not as impressive as the cocktails ... up to few months ago - seem like the menu has significantly changed. Although originally we were planning only on drinks and couple of appetizers, we were so impressed with the food that we continued ordering more and more of the new menu - as we had a full dinner there at the bar. All the flatbreads were wonderful - my husband's lamb was a bomb - and they even wrapped the bones to take home for our dogs ;-O Also the pedestrian area that allows you to walk right in (very unique in PHX) makes it perfect spot to enjoy urban life - coming from Prague - this makes me feel closer to home."}
{"text":"Thank you, Kimpton, for bringing a classy bar, an urban vibe and truly outstanding cocktails to downtown Phoenix. God knows we needed it. 

The bar space is what I would call rustic chic with a wood-based design foundation accented with glam/shiny touches. While there is plenty of seating at the fairly large bar, there is also a fantastic long community table parallel to the bar. 

The service has been very good so far, with friendly bartenders and servers who are pretty prompt in delivering the drinks, which is no small feat given that each one is handcrafted and unique. Some of the smaller touches really make the drinking experience standout - from the larger block ice cubes to the daily fruit-infused water, this is definitely the place to quench your thirst and get your buzz on. Many of the drinks are outstanding, but I definitely recommend the Brown Derby (bourbon-based), Queen's Park Swizzle (rum-based) and the Rising Sun (tequila-based). But, of course, many of the others are good too, and you know I've never met an adult beverage I didn't like! 

I definitely enjoy the food at Blue Hound as well (the zucchini corn dogs are awesome), but I think the menu is a little light on vegetarian selections. I wish that dishes like the cheddar biscuits and mac and cheese didn't come with bacon and ham automatically or could be made without them. 

This little thing aside, though, Blue Hound is a wonderful - and important - addition to downtown Phoenix and I say \"welcome\"!"}
{"text":"The Kimpton is one our favorite hotel to stay, eat and drink when we travel. When we are in town, we usually end up downtown for events so we tend to stop by for a drink or two. At night, the place feels and looks cozy and laid back. On this night, we celebrated the year of the dog. We got 3 dots and a dash, pork shank and roasted chicken. The pork and chicken were tasty but were a little dried."}
{"text":"Found this place near our hotel with Yelp. The atmosphere and modern industrial decor were very impressive and felt trendy. The food was very good and didn't disappoint. Service was good, but food was a little pricey."}
{"text":"We started out with the Shishito peppers which have been amazing every time I've had them. Then Moved onto the Pork Shank and the then the homemade pasta & the Elote..  All AMAZING"}
{"text":"We keep thinking the next time it will be better...slow service and rude bartenders. We sat at the community table and waited for a server to take our drink order, when that wasn't happening after 15 min, we went to the bar and were told to sit down and a server was in charge of the table and they had customers in front of us. Every time..."}
{"text":"Blue Hound has an eclectic, creative menu full of diverse choices - so good for dates, business meals, etc. - something for everyone. 

We had a large group so got to try a large array of appetizers and dishes (sharing is caring) and everything was superb.

For starters we had the following: Corn Grit Fries Smoked bacon, white cheddar, pomodoro (so good); Short Rib Sliders Root beer onions, horseradish cream, king's hawaiian roll; Boudin Balls Tomato? jam, green onions (really good); Artisan Meat and Cheese Board Fruit,? nuts, crackers.

For my main dish I had the Pappardelle Schreiner's sausage ragu - rich and tasty but not too rich - perfect.

For desserts, I had the house made sorbets - all really tasty.

Good wine and cocktail selection too.

Nice decor - lots of wood, natural light and cozy feel for a large restaurant at night. Gets a little loud, but not unbearable. Service was good - not outstanding, but perfectly fine (think we may have had a relatively new waitress).

Would definitely consider going back if in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Date night done right. The hotel was sold out, so needless to say the restaurant was packed. Which is a good sign! We had an extremely knowledgeable bartender that helped us order drinks and food. We had the shishito peppers and fried green tomatoes with crab. Ended with the Arctic Char. Amazing service and amazing drinks."}
{"text":"Still needs work and I had the misfortune of  being a Guinea pig to the main course.  I loved all the appetizers I ordered and was excited to have the short rib and grits.  Unfortunately the short rib was all fat,  I took two bites of the short rib hoping it would get better., it was pure white fat.  I felt sick from eating it and was asked if I would like another rib.  Unfortunately after eating two pieces I was grossed out from the fat.  
I also was offered 10 percent off my tab for the short rib?  I only had two bites and got 10 percent off?? I was honestly angry at that point, I did not eat it, they took it away, and now I am going to pay for it?  Luckily the manager corrected the bill and said it was a miss communication between him and the server.  

Maybe after the corrections to the menu and items offered this will be a great place to eat.  After being subjected to the most fat consumed in 2 bites I am going to pass on this place and wait it out.

Hopefully some other Yelpers can try out new menu items so I am not the test subject for it."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER! I LOVE this place. I like their cocktails too. Just a little pricey for me but wonderful for special occasions and when you have a little extra. I never turn down the blue hound."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was a great experience for Father's Day!  I did my Yelp due diligence but always expect the best.  We did a 5pm early dinner, so it was a slow, Sunday holiday afternoon and a shame considering the amazing Father's Day menu.    As a Vegan its not my kind of food, but I found plenty to eat and they offer GF, V, VG.  But for my Dad it was perfect!  Crazy special menu for Dad's with to die for beer mustard!  I'm surprised I didn't find that advertised anywhere when searching for what to do in Phoenix for Father's day.  Shame!

We were served right away in the bar and got attentive service right to the dinner table.  Our dinner waiter Chris was excellent and talked us through the whole menu.  We didn't want for anything, he took us all the way to then end with a to die for dessert.  Environment, ambiance, layout, vibe & view... all excellent!  You can Valet park with hotel and they validate it down to $5 + tip.

Based on reviews the Tater Tots and cauliflower were excellent as reviewed!  The bacon is inside the tater tots not on side, but both are a must.  The grilled broccoli was good, but nothing special.  We shared all that and Summer Panzanella - with grilled fruit and cornbread and it was good but it wouldn't bring me back.  The waiter, cauliflower and dessert would!  But plenty more to try on menu.

Father's day menu was incredible and unique from Pate, beer mustard, pickled cauliflower, pork chops, onion gravy, 3 drinks ales to Scotch and literally a \"root beer\" float made with ice cream and ale beer!

Upon waitor's recommendation I ordered the upside down pineapple cake and it literally melts in your mouth... incredibly delicious!  All in all a very good experience prices from $5 - $50 on menu!  So works for everyone, great venue for business, nice occasional dinner, drinks, date, happy hour.

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here to start off the evening  and have drinks in order to entertain our out of town guests.  It was so packed in the restaurant;  however they gave us the option to sit at the bar and wait for available seats. Right away, I felt a  \"stank vibe\"in the in the atmosphere, which I am totally not down for. But none the less I decided to give it a chance considering it could have just been my skewed perception. We did not get greeted promptly, we actually had to ask for menus and water.  After sitting about for about 10 minutes, a waiter comes over and asks what we'd like. I did have a lot of questions about the drink menu because I had only been here one other time. The waiter seemed dry, which made me feel some kind of way. So I  trusted my instincts and ordered the Tropical Margarita and it was so good.  I think it had tequila , yellow chartreuse,  basil , and  citrus. The drink made up for the lack of service but I would probably go back again for the great drink I had."}
{"text":"Great food and service, but kinda pricey.  Great date spot!  Loved the ambience.  Our server, Kevin, was great."}
{"text":"Blue Hound is absolutely amazing. There aren't a lot of craft cocktail bars with mixologists in AZ so to have found one as good as Blue Hound was stellar. The bartenders are knowledgeable as well as the barbacks (Kevin rules). I've gone on several occasions, had lovely experiences each time and introduced friends to the wonderful world of craft drinks. Personal favorite drink was created by one of their own bartenders and it's called Paris in Satori, give it a try if you make it down there!"}
{"text":"I'll comment on something that was great first - the decor! Very modern but warm with wood, glass and metal. It's a bit loud, but it was Friday night, so pretty busy. The seating was comfortable, nice looking bar, etc. The the lighting over the bar area was gorgeous. 

I really wanted to like this restaurant - Phoenix Magazine certainly did...it's on their Top 10 New Restaurants list in the current issue. From the raving review, it sounded great -- so a group of us hopped on the Metro and headed downtown to try it Friday night. 

To sum it up, Phoenix magazine needs to hire new food critics - this is not one of the top 10 new restaurants in Phoenix this year. 

The service was mediocre. The waiter forgot 2 dishes, and was irritated because we were trying to figure out who owed what on the bill...while we had our coffee.

For appetizers, we had the Tater tots, deviled eggs & the caramel corn for appetizers: The tater tots were very flavorful. The deviled eggs were okay, but not great. Just not spiced well. The caramel corn was really good with the chili pepper and caramel sort of blending together.  

The short ribs on a bed of blue cheese grits was really very good, probably the best thing on the menu.  The pork neck was bland. The ceviche was not very chilled, and also tasted bland. The Kale salad was ok, but kinda just a big pile of chopped kale with dressing on it and a few croutons tossed on top. Two people had the mac & cheese and thought it was good, but the serving was really small. 

The wine I had was pretty good, but they didn't have the one on the menu that I wanted so suggested the wine they'd replaced it with. (only the replacement wine was $12 a glass & the one I'd wanted was $8!)  Several other people had cocktails and they all enjoyed them. So I'm thinking the bar is probably the highlight of this restaurant!

Sorry, but Blue Hound is just not even near the top 10 new restaurants."}
{"text":"First time here was a great time, dropped a fair bit of cash. Came back with my cousin visiting from Chicago and another buddy cause they needed to try the lawless cocktail.

That didn't happen, if you expect a place to hang out after a dbacks game head somewhere else. Apparently we were not dressed to their standards (coming from a baseball game).

Thanks but no thanks, Tilted Kilt was the place to be and I'll let the rich kids play by themselves."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my mom & her friends today. Over all the staff was great! Two thumbs up. How ever the food was okay, they gave us the wrong flat bread & when told they let us have the wrong one to munch on (we were starving!) and made the correct one - I think, it said pork belly was on it but it looked more like brisket. They also gave us some Carmel popcorn (the best part of the meal! Then at the end we ordered 2 cappuccinos but they were clearly espresso with no milk, and had to request half and half to go with it. So in short- okay food, excellent service, with some hiccups that were addressed extremely graciously."}
{"text":"Blue Hound.  Oh how I want to love you.  I've stayed at the Palomar in San Francisco and was so excited they built one here.  I figured the Blue Hound had to be awesome.  
The decor is what I expected.  Super hip with a floor to ceiling windows that gave us a great view of CityScape from our table.  
The menu is very intriguing with items such as fried quail, cheddar scallion biscuits, and Kobe beef short ribs.  All of those items were fairly tasty as well.  The short ribs were a little difficult to eat and I think they were cooked a little too long.  
The service needs work.  We wanted to get a bottle of wine and asked our server for a recommendation.  I understand he was no sommelier, but figured he'd have some knowledge on their offerings.  I let him know my tastes and said I normally get chardonnay, but would like to try something new and would like to hear what he recommended.  He said if we like chardonnay, get chardonnay.  Mmmmmmmkay.  So much for trying something new.  I am allergic to eggs and asked him if the fried quail was dipped in an egg wash before frying.  He replied by saying he had no idea things were dipped in egg before frying and that he learned something new.  I like to go to restaurants to try new things and trust the servers know more about the menu than I do and can assist me in finding the right options.  I got the impression that servers here are just order takers and food runners.  I recommend a little training on the menu items for the servers.  
This was my second time at Blue Hound.  The first time we sat at a table in the lounge area for 10 minutes and was never addressed so left.  The food was not memorable enough to overlook the lackluster service.  I was invited to a birthday there recently and opted to meet the group after they left.  They let me know the service was terrible again.  It's a shame.  If the employee vibe was elevated, this could be a great spot to hang out at while downtown."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come on a date with your honey !  we shared some snacks and were asking questions about the hand crafted cocktails and the waiter liked us so much he gave a free cocktail to try and we loved it! It had smoke infused bourbon, not only dramatic and inventive but delish!  I cant wait to go back for more.  Foodies will love this place!"}
{"text":"This spot is located inside the Palomar. It's kind of hard to find if you are going straight off of GPS. But the hotel folks were very helpful once I stumbled upon it. Take the elevator up and sit at the bar if you are solo. The eats here are a tad pricey, wine list was perfect. This is great to stop in for a quick beverage. They also have some light bites if that is your thing. I think this would be a perfect place to bring out of town clients or anything business related. The atmosphere is beautiful and modern. I very much enjoyed my crisp Spanish white vino. Aside from that, they have some good looking salads. I will have to eat next time."}
{"text":"Slow Service and Overpriced

Two and a half hours and $136 for 10oz of alcoholic beverages, 6 tator tots, flatbread, dry chicken and cold steak.

I went here with my wife for our 5-yr dating anniversary.  We had a $50 gift card, and I naively came here thinking we would have a \"free\" meal, but it didn't even cover half the price of our dining experience.
The drinks we got were good, but they just cost too much for the tiny little glass of cocktail you get.  My wife's amaretto sour couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 ounces, and it cost $15.  So yeah, you pay a lot for little cutesy cocktails.
The tator tots and flatbread were probably the best things we got ($20 for those two items).
My wife got the herb roasted chicken for $24 and the chicken was pretty bland and dry.  I got the flat-iron steak ($30), which tasted really good.  The only problem was it was cold-well, cool rather.  But it was as if the steak had been sitting on my plate for 25 minutes before I got it, which may be just what happened.  It took an hour to get our food after we ordered it.  After 55 minutes of waiting, I had to leave to go re-fill our parking meter, so I got to get some exercise in the middle of our dining experience.  It was like our outside table was forgotten.  
Our waiter was great, but he had a bunch of inside tables, so we just hardly ever saw him.  My water glass was usually empty, and we were typically waiting a while before we could order something.
The atmosphere is cool, and I did enjoy the tator tots and the taste of my steak.  If the whole meal had been closer to $50, and if the service had been faster, I could give this place 4-5 stars probably.  But as it was, it was just too expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"An update.  We went back to Blue Hound for dinner instead of just getting appetizers.  When we went it was in September (yes I'm behind in my reviews).  As I'm writing this review, I went to re-check the menu to remember the specific name of the dish I got, and the whole menu has changed.  So take that in mind, maybe the food will be better if you go now, vs. the menu selection we had in September. 

From what I remember, I was just generally unimpressed with what options we had to choose from and the food wasn't amazing.  That is why I decreased my rating.  The experience just made us cross this off the list of \"great places to eat\" in phx.  I don't think we'll be doing a whole trip down here for the food.  

I am curious to see if the new menu would be more promising though...."}
{"text":"We got into town really late after a long cross-country flight so this place hit the spot. I enjoyed my old fashioned and the brisket sliders and corn grit fries were excellent as well. The kitchen closed earlier than you'd think (I can't remember the exact time) so we apparently just made the cut on a Thursday night. It's pricey but much better than your average hotel bar so it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Heaven. This was recommended to us by a local as the 'not-to-be-missed'. We were surprised to find such a gem in the midst of a million spots near the convention center. Recommend the deviled eggs and shishito peppers for appetizers. BLT, crab cake, and fried moz salad. Try the High Heaven and Outlaw for cocktails. Perfect perfect perfect service. Tip: book through Open Table to insure a spot. You will love it."}
{"text":"After unexpectedly getting stranded in Phoenix on a Tuesday night, Blue Hound felt like a saving grace, as one of the only restaurants that looked appetizing and was still open at 9:30.

The bar atmosphere felt trendy and upscale at the same time and the menu selections were great. It was definitely the type of place I'd go back to for a proper dining experience, not jus tan I want to die because I've been traveling for the last 10 hours experience.

It seemed like the type of place where the menu changed often based on the chef's selection, and I like that. I tried the Chef Selection flatbread which that night was an arugula flatbread with grilled steak, and goat cheese. It was more than enough for me to eat, and a hard decision when there were other fantastic sounding Menu choices."}
{"text":"I was excited to go here for restaurant week. HOWEVER: The portions of meat were zapped with a shrinking gun. So tiny; no bigger than my palm. The food was delicious, but I weigh 100 lbs and I left hungry. Don't waste your money like I did."}
{"text":"Great lounge to have delicious cocktails!

Great drinks and yummy food - shrimp and grits was very tasty. I ordered quite a few sidecars...

Staff is polite and on point. DTPHX has great places where you can jump around to!"}
{"text":"The Blue Hound is the best restaurant/bar in CityScape.  The service is professional and the management knows how to treat hotel guests as well as City Scape residents with respect. As residents for almost 8 months we have never had to argue, prove, or ask twice for the discounts that were promised to us.  Additionally, their pretzel bun classic burger is pure evil. Yum.  Thank you Blue Hound."}
{"text":"A bit pricy but the atmosphere is incredible. Dark and beautiful hotel lounge/restaurant. Drinks & appetizers (fried green tomatoes, peppers and cheese and meat board) were fabulous. Entree's were good but not great (pasta and catfish). I would definitely go again but I would probably stick to the apps and drinks only."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant in City Scape on the 2nd floor, the windows show an nice view of downtown. Sit outside is weather allows 

Food; ordered the ribeye, may have been the best I tasted in a while. It was perfectly cooked and prepared. The special drinks are also perfect. 

Service; Our Server was on point, great customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance! 

Drinks and food are spectacular! I recommend the Pimm's Mule and the Seared Ahi Tuna salad!!  They will not disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"Basically... nothing here for the vegetarian.  Too bad.  It's a nice place, great location."}
{"text":"Big fan.  We had a small group (5) and we're a silly group.  Comfy seating, relaxed atmosphere.   Really good food...loved the fried green tomatoes and the cheese plate and flatbread.  The drinks were amazing...amazing.  I had this thing with celery bitters.  Savory and smooth.  But the Lawless.  Oh the Lawless.  It did not appeal to me at first bit then I smelled it.  Wow.  Then I tasted it.  Wow, wow.  I don't like whisky.  But I liked this.  A lot."}
{"text":"I arrived at around 7 PM on a Saturday night and asked for a table for three. I was told by two nice hostesses that their tables were all reserved and booked until 8:15 ish, but that I could take my drinks and food to a seating area in the adjoining hotel. I just wanted to grab some light nosh and my friends who were meeting me were driving from the airport, straight off of a flight, and we had a concert to catch, so I decided to grab a seat at the bar instead. 

I expected it to be difficult to find a seat at the bar but surprisingly, there was one open and available. I didn't have to wait for more than a few seconds before a menu was placed in front of me and a quick second later that I was given an extensive liquor list.

Service was prompt and expeditious and the bartenders were knowledgable and kind. I ordered the short rib sliders and shishito peppers, wanting to grab something that could be made quickly and that the bartender said the kitchen could whip up within minutes. And the appetizers were brought up from the kitchen within five or so minutes of ordering! I was shocked because of how quickly they were ready but the server reassured me that the dishes were fresh.

And the sliders were divine - perfect five bites of tender and large hunks of meat sandwiched between plump rolls. The horseradish sauce that was on the short rib wasn't overpowering, was piquant and nicely complimented the short rib. 

The shishito peppers were delicious! Not too greasy (like other shishito peppers I've had) and was accompanied by a creamy Siracha dipping sauce and that was such a nice flavor thaf complimented the peppers but didn't take away from the flavor of the peppers. 

I also had a delicious glass of their Laphroaig scotch and asked for it with a smidgen of water. I was served a small carafe of water to splash on top of the scotch. And it was divine! Their liquor menu is impressive and extensive - they carry a large selection of scotches from all over the world and whiskeys, both domestic and even the coveted Japanese whiskeys. 

I will definitely be returning and next time, bringing my husband for a date. I can't wait to peruse their dinner menu and to try their selection of interesting dishes."}
{"text":"I am so in awe of how in awe I am at Blue Hound that I just want you to go. Part of the appeal is all the sensory surprises, but in case you need some motivation:

THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF WHY I F*CKING LOVE BLUE HOUND:

- Most egg whites (plus one whole egg, for good measure) on a cocktail menu.

- The boozy, housemade horchata situation.

- The drink thing with the whole egg in it also contains crème de mure, stout, and whiskey.

- There is a literal smokeshow that accompanies the Lawless (a tobacco-smoked glass of bourbon, wormwood liqueur, and house-made \"truck stop bitters.\")

-  Vodka's day at the spa in my mouth: grapefruit liqueur, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, rose flower water.

- The cheese plate. Fig spread. Good bread. Pungent chevre. 

In essence, if you pray at the temple of the cocktail God, welcome to salvation. Experimental, complex, artisanal, thoughtful, refined, and fun as hell... heaven. *abandons religious metaphor* Love craft cocktails? Put your physical form at this bar."}
{"text":"Second floor of Hotel Palomar (Kimpton) was hard to find not knowing that. Super high end cocktails made with a lot of attention to the details. From burning smoke into glasses to old school drinks using egg whites... Cocktails are absolutely first rate.

Interior is posh, cozy, cool. Very comfortable with restaurant, bar, lounge chair seating options. I started with the Hamachi Crudo ($15) which was ridiculous. I pondered ordering a second. Smoke infused caviar - oh my. Entrée went with Short Rib and Scallop ($55). Delicious. Wine selections by the glass were somewhat limited (one Chardonnay for instance) but not enough to diminish the experience.  They had about five reds and five whites to choose. 

Definitely worth the trip especially if you are downtown. Walking distance from many nearby hotels."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for my son's 23rd birthday celebration. From the call for a reservation to the time we left, every interaction was absolutely perfect. The service, beautiful cocktails and food were all absolutely wonderful. I can't wait to come back for happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"We only had a chance to stop in here briefly for June's milkshake shop but I am looking forward to coming back to try the food. The tots look delish. Can't wait to try them! 

I love the decor of this place! So many fun elements and a great view of downtown."}
{"text":"Bland food service was OK left hungry I know I sound like I'm complaining but place felt stuffy and staff acted like they were doing us a favor."}
{"text":"Cool ambience! Deviled eggs and flatbreads are tasty, along with the strawberry trifle dessert."}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, modern and upscale. The cocktails were special and stood out. My favorites were the Lost Melody and Black Mamba. We had a great server who was very knowledgeable about the spirits. He gave us a few history lessons... It was interesting. Started with the kale salad but wasn't blown away. I had the chicken as my main entree and it was full of flavor and delicious! Shared the chocolate pudding with marshmallow fluff for dessert. SO GOOD. Will definitely return for the cocktails."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of \"tapas\", and Blue Hound has American-ized it.  The menu is a collection of interesting dishes that can be ordered by size, and are meant to be shared with your table.  

Definitely try the bacon jam biscuits with the quail egg - easily the best thing I've ever eaten in Phoenix, a true gem.

The flat breads were decent.  Also had the BBQ ribs and homemade tots - all of which were tasty in small quantities, which is exactly what tapas are meant to be.

The atmosphere is a bit hotel-ish and overly modern hipster.  Even the wait staff is overly-casual in attire, although they were all quite friendly and attentive.

This is a great place to take a date and show off - check it out"}
{"text":"This place has 5 star potential, but the service brought it down to 4. A friend and I sat at the bar for happy hour here at what was fated to be a tour of sliders in downtown... but that part of the story comes later. The place was busy, as I imagine it is typically for happy hour. Their happy hour drink menu leaves much to be desired... it only has 4 simple cocktails that don't really show off what this place is all about (elaborate and creative cocktails). We both tried the Tea cocktail that was on special for 6$. It was alright, very strong tea flavor which covered the vodka taste very well... in fact, it didn't taste much like alcohol at all... oh, but it had alcohol. These puppies were strong (haha unintentional pun), and both of us felt it. Here is when the problem arose. We sat at the bar for another 30-40 minutes and couldn't get the attention of any of the bartenders. We tried making eye contact to no avail. We really wanted to order food and I wanted to get another drink. Finally, about 1 minute before happy hour ended we slid in an order of happy hour sliders (heh) and I got a caribe drink of sorts (it had tequila, pineapple, other delish things...). The food and drink got to us quickly, so we were happy. I must say, the sliders were some of the most delicious sliders I have ever tasted... the pork belly was perfectly cooked and not overly fatty, they were delicate and all of the flavors worked together (pork, kimchi, hawaiian roll.... pure bliss). Oh ya, my drink was good too. So my tip is... do come for happy hour, get the snacks, but skip the weak happy hour drink specials and cough up the dough for one of their specialty drinks. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Blue Hound is a beautiful restaurant and we were seated within 10 min. We ordered several appetizers and it was hit or miss. The sliders and deviled eggs were good but the corn grit fries were not my favorite.  The pork shank was right on the money and the meat just fell off the bone. If you're on a date night, I would definitely recommend Blue Hound."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place out! 

After picking my friend up from the airport we were ready for some food and drinks and somewhere close to the airport. 

For food, we really wanted to try the duck wings, but they were currently out of it. Bummer! We shared the seared tuna, and the corn grit fries. These are not your ordinary fries. lol ( see picture) Everything was good and they have a pretty small menu to choose from. For drinks, I love places that will just make any custom drink based on your liking. I told the waiter I wanted a martini that was sweet but strong. And that's exactly what it was. lol 

I'd definitely come back for some more food and drinks!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had such a fun time at Blue Hound that we decided to go twice on a four-day stay in Sedona ...which was two hours away in Phoenix! 

On our first night, our flight was delayed so by the time we were arrived in Phoenix, we were starving and ready for a drink.  Yelpers, you did not fail me!!! Even though Sedona was two hours away from Phoenix, we ended up staying 3 to 4 hours at Blue Hound because we were having so much fun that we lost track of time. 

Along with my hand made pasta dinner, I ordered a drink off the whiskey menu that I can't remember (yes that's how good the night was), the Lawless, and a dram of Yamasaki.  The bartender, Jimmy, made my friend one of his very own signature drinks that he called a daiquiri but tasted nothing like the froufrou drink we commonly know. 

We enjoyed it so much that we returned to the Blue Hound on our way home from Phoenix. On our second visit, our bartender Kayla made me a gin + lavender drink accompanied with her handmade rosemary-berry ice cube. Even the popcorn was yummy! 

If you go on a weeknight you might even see some regulars such as Kevin...."}
{"text":"Food was great, cocktails were great, the bartender was awesome. However, the host stand? Well they are the reason for the 3 star rating. The host stand is the face of the establishment, and it's the first thing people see when they enter a place. When my boyfriend and I walked in around 9 and asked for a table they told us there were none available. And literally left it at that. I was like oookay, well can I put my name in? They countered with \"well they all just sat, so it's gonna be awhile...\" So I did a lap around the restaurant and was confused since some people were cashing out. I then approached the hosts again and asked if they had a wait system. They nodded yes. I said okay well how about you put my name in, and tell me how long the wait is. They obliged, with zero enthusiasm or warmth. Luckily 2 spots opened at the bar. Seriously, Blue Hound...you guys are awesome. But your hosts need hospitality training ASAP. We almost left because of them. Glad we didn't because the food/drink is great."}
{"text":"My lil bro and I came here for some pre-Suns game drinks and apps. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the plethora of liquors and drinks that they had on the menu and I was very impressed that he was shaking up drinks with one hand behind his back. The bourbon old fashioned that he made me was absolutely fantastic! Having recently returned from a trip to Japan, I was pleased to see the Japanese whiskys (yes, it's spelled with no e in Japan) that were on the menu. We got the short rib sliders and the blistered shishito peppers. The sliders were just ok, but I loved that they came on mini King's Hawaiian rolls. The peppers were spicy and delicious - it must have been the sriracha aioli. People around us seemed to be enjoying their food as well, so I would love to come back and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the food. Because there was nothing wrong with it and it came out fast. However everything else was slow. I did not get to order another drink during my whole meal. My friend never had his diet coke refilled the entire time. We had to ask the waiter for everything numerous times. My other friend finally walked up to the bar to order his drink. The food was average, nothing spectacular and kind of pricey for what it is. Service is incredibly slow and it was not busy- empty tables everywhere."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and staying at the Palomar hotel. Since having the food here I have not eaten anywhere else! All is fabulous! From appetizers to salads to main entrees it offers something special and unique at a fair price!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really good upscale food, but unpretentious. Wait staff is very knowledgeable & helpful with recommendations (Gemma!) She recommended the delicious Uncle Bear Mandarin Wheat - a new favorite for sure! I had the Brussels sprouts (bacon jam glaze & a fried egg on top) and fried green tomatoes (spicy roumelade & lump crab.) Chocolate cake with banana ice cream & PB sauce. To die for. And my bill was barely $40. If you're in PHX, eat here!"}
{"text":"What a excellent find for dinner with co workers! Close to convention center (walkable) with vast menu. All appetizers are delicious favorites include: fried green tomatoes, short rib sliders, burrata, BHKC Deviled Eggs and Artisan Cheese Selection! Don't miss the Crispy Mozzarella Salad and Swordfish Entree. 

Save room for desserts and yes I do mean all of them! Had one of each and couldn't pick a favorite! 

This place is a true gem - great atmosphere (slightly noisy at times), however, gastro pub feel and excellent food will have me returning next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Went recently to celebrate my 35th birthday with my twin sister and my folks. 
We were all thoroughly impressed!! I get nervous taking my dad to new places. He's kinda old school and simple and trendy food isn't really his thing. But he gave it two thumbs up and 5 stars! 
He and my mother both got the chicken dish. I was able to steal a bite and I know what I'm getting next time now! 
My sister and I shared the melt in your mouth steak entree. And also shared a few small plates. 
I could of done without the fried green tomatoes. They were just kinda plain and the crab was fishy. 
We also shared the Brussel sprouts. A must! Even tho our bowl was mostly pork belly and very few Brussels, but seems like a tough thing to complain about. 
I will definitely be returning. 
Ambience is rustic and trendy. Kind of loud. And our server was great, but she didn't seem present in the moments with us as she seemed overly busy."}
{"text":"While the first time I came here was a solid 3 stars, the second time was very enjoyable. This time I ordered the cheese board and just like the last time, there were like 3 cheeses, pistachios, another kind of nut, jam, bread, etc. Very good and plentiful. Last time, we ordered the warm mixed nuts that were really good but I couldn't eat too much of it. My husband ordered this pork dish that had hominy, and I don't remember what else but it was freakin awesome. I kept eating out of his skillet. Yum. My $10 specialty cocktail was knock me on my ass strong but good. I gave it to my husband after while because I would have been drunk just off the one. I guess that is a good problem to have. The service was top-notch. She was just the right amount of attentive and did a great job. The decor was bright and modern. I really enjoyed this last experience."}
{"text":"Wow! Another great spot to go in downtown Phoenix. Cocktails were spot on and unique. Our waitress Natalie was superb. Our dinner of the fresh pasta was perfect. Atmosphere was classy and casual all at the same time. We will definitely visit again when we are in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was my first time back to Blue Hound in about two years. Everything about our visit (a business dinner with a job candidate) was terrific, particularly the service--flawless. I was a tad disappointed with a couple of dishes, though. First, I was really sad to see that the biscuits with bacon jam were not on the starters menu any more. *sob*  Second, we ordered the fried green tomatoes because our job candidate had never eaten them before. I was hesitant, if only because I grew up in the South and am pretty picky about that dish. These were just ok, and honestly, for $16, they were not up to snuff. The tomato slices were tiny--about the size of a silver dollar--and would have been pretty forgettable if not for the lump crab and remoulade accompanying them.

The shishito peppers, however, were outstanding and at $9, a fair price.  We also had the bone marrow starter (also $16), which is utterly delicious but not really the right size for three people to share.  Two people, sure, and I'll order them again.

For our mains, we had two orders of the trout and the flat-iron steak.  All were cooked perfectly and plated very nicely. My steak was medium-rare, as requested, and the cherries in the glaze accompanying it really made the dish (one of my dinner partners kept asking me for another)!

We finished by sharing a slice of the pineapple upside down cake. I loved it. Moist, not too sweet, light rather than dense. The sorbet served with it, however, really couldn't hold its own. Its flavor wasn't distinctive enough and something with a more significant mouth-feel would be a better foil for the cake. 

The total for our dinner, not including alcohol or tip, was $145. That's steep for three people, but if you're looking for a place to go for a special occasion, Blue Hound Kitchen should be an option."}
{"text":"A fine choice in a hotel. Decent food. Good service."}
{"text":"It was fine. The drinks were interesting and delicious, and the food was just... fine. I really wanted to love all of the food that we tried but I didn't find that they were nearly as exciting as the drinks. 

We started with the shishito peppers, deviled eggs, and Ahi Tuna. Tuna was good, but quinoa ball with it lacked flavor.  The peppers were good but too spicy, and this is coming from somebody who really loves spicy food.

 I had the pork shank as a main dish with braised greens. It was cooked perfectly and was very tender but not that flavorful, and the greens were extremely salty. My friend had the salmon and said it was good flavor, but a little bit overcooked.

Service was excellent.  Bar was great. Drinks were worth going for...  but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a cocktail. They have so many unique drinks that you will not find at other bars. I have never eaten dinner/lunch here but have had many drinks...some were fantastic, while others were a little too crazy for me. I love the \"Summer Smash\", very refreshing and bonus...it was only $5.00! The popcorn is yummy; spicy and sweet! The french fries are good too! The outdoor bar overlooks the stadium and is a nice relaxing spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 received slow service from a waiter who seemed irritated that he was serving us.  The sea bass was extremely over-cooked and completely devoid of flavor. Our appetizers were the fried oysters, tater tots, deviled eggs, and fried green tomatoes with lump meat crab; they all needed some seasoning.  Giving two stars because the environment was nice and my colleague said his flat iron steak was OK."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday bunch, and loved it! Ordered the Chop Salad (without chicken) and a mimosa. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Blue hound! I loved the atmosphere, the signature cocktails, the wine list, the service, and the awesome food!! This place is a must try!! My favorite menu items were the pulled pork on Johnny cakes, the tater tots, and the donuts!! I want to go back again to try more menu items!!"}
{"text":"Blue Hound is an upscale bar and restaurant downtown. I had a little trouble finding the place because it's on the second floor. I really likes the corn grit fries. It's a little pricey but the food and drink is great."}
{"text":"Great Happy Drinks and Food! The old fashion with bourbon is one of the best I've had downtown"}
{"text":"Pork belly was awesome and they whipped up the best Bloody Mary I have ever had.  I strolled in during December/January when it was cold and chilly outside, and decided I didn't want to go find something outside in the cold.  I am really glad this place is conveniently located in the Palomar.  Atmosphere was great, but food was better.  My waiter was also really nice, perfect balance of attention, but also gave me and my honey some personal time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  Can get crowded but they do take reservations.  They make a mean steak and their bacon jelly....to die for!"}
{"text":"Brunch was very disappointing, cocktails were mediocre, and there was just no atmosphere with the total of 3 people in this restaurant. Food was just average, not worth the pain of parking at this place. Does not validate and valet is $12."}
{"text":"Was expecting a lot from this place. Made reservations for 10 thinking that everyone would be sitting together, we were all separated. We were eventually all seated together outside in the patio, but it took forever to get a server.

Wasn't the best experience. 

Drinks were good."}
{"text":"Not a big fan... was out of most alcoholic beverages attempted to be ordered.  Food was decent, but service was mediocre."}
{"text":"The space is gorgeous and the menu is definitely artistic but I was not a huge fan. I got a melon salad and my friend got the pesto pasta. Neither of us were impressed. I wouldn't recommend this place for a dinner. Maybe drinks and a snack."}
{"text":"Ah.May.ZING!

Blue Hound definitely blew my taste buds out of the water last night. From the pork belly sliders, to the seafood chowder I ordered to go, and certainly not last the decedent pineapple upside down cake, I was in foodie heaven. 

The sliders were topped with a crisp kimchi that paired marvelously with the tender pork belly. There were two somewhat smallish portions. I ate one and set the other aside to finish later that night. Because the principle reason I chose BH was the dessert, I asked for my second course to be boxed. I sampled the chowda at home later in the evening and it was wicked good: the ghost chile, which on the scoville scale it 10 degrees from being an A-bomb in your mouth (and, presumably, another fire a bit lower) brought an amazing heat balance with the subtle bacon and prominent mussels and clams. I'm not sure how this is served in the restaurant, but for the to-go you get a box of the clams and mussels. On to dessert. Simply wonderful! The salted caramel sauce is something I'd love to have a bottle of at home. It's decadent to the nth degree. It's the one sweet treat that I would give up sex for. It's *that* good.

At $40, this was an incredible value. Honestly, I think two people could easily share this meal and be pleasantly sated.

Who's my Daddy? You are, Blue Hound."}
{"text":"Pork belly appetizer was delish! Lovin the cocktail list and their extensive whisky selection!
Stopped here while passing through Phoenix on our way to \"T-town\" from Sedona :) Had a great trip with great food and were looking to continue that without venturing too far from the freeway. We found this using my phone and had one heck of a time trying to find out. Turns out, it is in the backside of a hotel that opens up to a little mall like area. Any parking was confusing but we ended up there and were glad we did. 
Atmosphere was definitely the chic industrial trendy gatro pub thing. Service was great and food was fantastic. My hubby and I both got whisky inspired cocktails off their house cocktail list and were quite impressed. 
My husband made a \"joke\" about the cornichon on his burger asking what they do to make them so small and the server handled his bad joke very well. 
We frequently traverse through Phoenix and Scottsdale so we will be back! 
If your in the area walking around, look this place up and treat yourself to some new flavors both in the food and drinks! An overall pleasant experience! 

If you are driving from somewhere else.... I might find a restaurant with a parking lot..."}
{"text":"Cocktails only- the service is spot on with a serious craft cocktail list, which is creative and inspired. Had a great evening prior to dinner. 
Will return!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and it was wonderful. The Rosemary Fries and Shistake Pepper small plates were delish! The drink menu is amazing. The restaurant itself is very pretty, hip, eclectic, and clean. The bartenders make you feel at home. Did not eat dinner here but it looked great. The negative is that this place is pricey."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here as part of his birthday celebration.  After walking all the way around the block from Charming Charlie, entering the Hotel Palomar and taking the elevator to the second floor, we entered the bar... only to find we could have just exited Charming Charlie and walked right across the courtyard to a second entrance!

The bar was hopping, so we snagged one of the last seating areas - directly across from the host stand.  We sat on leather ottomans and waited for our waitress.

The waitress appeared within a couple minutes and grabbed us a bar menu.  We looked at the menu for several minutes before deciding on:

me - Queen's Park Swizzle
him - Brown Derby

The Queen's Park Swizzle was like the Mexican Flag colored version of a mojito.  It was good, but not great.  That said, it was pretty strong.

The Brown Derby was delicious, with just the right hint of citrus.

Our cocktails were $8 each before tax and tip, so we stopped at one each.  Besides, we had a birthday night schedule to stick to!  

In this area of town, there are a lot of choices.  Blue Hound won't likely be one of mine.  

I could be convinced to try out their happy hour, but I don't know that I'd stick around for the food.  This place is a little too... uhhh... \"hip\" for me.  I actually HATED the artwork and the seating was uncomfortable.  The lighting was pretty cool, though (check out the pictures I snapped).

Overall, I'd say I was teetering between a 3 and 4... but I chose to award the place 3 stars because my cocktail was not spectacular for the price."}
{"text":"Happy New Years 2016!!! 

This place was my New Years dinner and I don't have too many complaints.  Thank goodness. 

Blue Hound's American fare was great food and Great ambiance mixed into one. 

Got there at 700pm and front desk gal said it would be 5 minutes. It was 15 minutes later and no reasoning why a bit later, but hey it's New Years so I just carried on through with a smile. 

Ambiance is superb with bar seating, nice bar and seating deeper inside that had nice window views of downtown Phoenix. There were also picnic table seating outside but it's way too cold for that on Jan 1st ! 

I wanted something light so I got the handmade pasta with marinara , parm, basil , garlic and onions. The noodles were like angel hair and can totally tell they were house made. Sauce was pretty good though it tasted more on the ketchup side than the marinara side. Overall it was nice presentable dish with great noodles and overall great flavors.  Would I get it again ? Probably not. 

Menu is fairly small , but it makes picking something easier.  Guy next to me said his meal was \"average.\" I felt the same way ...it was good but not something to talk about. The ambiance made up for it. 

If you are in the area looking for a fancy good plate and great ambiance , come check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a stellar restaurant in the midst of a sleepy downtown. If you are looking for a memorable meal in downtown Phoenix this is your place. The ambiance is great with gorgeous light fixtures and comfortable seating. They have a large bar for drinks with a good happy hour appetizer menu. At dinner, try the mussels in a garlic/ginger beee broth. The pappardelle sausage Ragu was delicious. Great place!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place! Thank you Chef Stephen, Derek, Chris and all of the Blue Hound staff for making my birthday dinner more than amazing last night. I couldn't have asked for better food, better cocktails, better service or better company. The food was cooked to perfection and with a lot of love. Our server Chris was very well versed in the menu and gave some great recommendations! If you go you must try the biscuits, short rib, hamachi and for dessert get the pineapple upside down cake! The card signed by your staff was such a nice touch. Please make sure you pass on my thanks! I will be back and I will tell everyone about this place."}
