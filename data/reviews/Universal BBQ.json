{"text":"This Place is truthfully an authentic Portuguese BBQ chicken restaurant at its best. It really is a Hidden Gem of Brampton. This place would do so much better with more advertising and more word of mouth."}
{"text":"$28.50 That's how much it costed for one chicken, medium rice, 1 can of coke and a side of hot sauce. I even asked the guy and he confirmed that it was the correct price.  I'd been here over a couples years ago, and tbh, I can't remember if the price gauging was this bad. It's true, and if you look in the pics, this place does have a huge oven where they *sometimes* cook the chicken over wood. I think that's what I had on that last visit and it was fresh. On this visit, the wood grill certainly hadn't been fired up recently and neither was the rotisserie going. The chicken was pulled out of a steamed tray along with the rice. I didn't have time to argue with the price or just walk away since I was with my kids and getting them dinner asap. At least I was hoping that the chicken quality would offset the ridiculous bill.  Well, that proved to be unfounded as the chicken was just basic rotisserie takeout; moreover it wasn't fresh so it was dried out. Rice was lacklustre and undercooked.   One of the worst experiences I've had with value-for-food; but I'll leave it at two star since I do remember having a fresh one previously off the wood-fired oven. I'd strongly recommend you call ahead and find out if the wood oven is going; otherwise, save your money and go to virtually any other Portuguese chicken place and it will probably be fresher too."}
{"text":"For anyone who has been in the area of Mayfield and Hurontario you have probably driven by this place because it sure is hidden.  Its in a plaza that is set up a bit weird.  Now as you read this review and you are in that area and hungry you have to stop in.  This is as Portuguese as it gets.  The owner/cook is an older Portuguese man and let me tell you he knows what he is doing.  From the minute you park you can smell the charcoal from the BBQ.  Once you get inside your eyes go right to the huge fire pit that they use to cook the chicken.  There is nothing better than the taste of charcoal on you meat.  Chicken is super tasty especially when you ask to put the sauce on it.  Potatoes and rice are average but to be honest its the chicken that counts.  Great job.  I see myself becoming a frequent flyer of Universal BBQ."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken. The whole meal is great. Chicken is cooked on fire. Hidden gem.  If you are in the neighbourhood stop by and pick up some hot freshly cooked chicken."}
{"text":"Fist time checking out this place, so far the best Portuguese bbq chicken I've had since moving to Brampton!!"}
