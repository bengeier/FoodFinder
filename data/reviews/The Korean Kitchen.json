{"text":"The first time I went to the Korean Kitchen it was because it was new, and the Sunrise House had a line-up. The first time, I was pleasantly surprised. I order a standard bibimbap, and my partner had pork bulgogi. The portions were reasonable for someone eating dinner, and small for someone expecting to gorge themselves on cheap Korean food. However, the intensity of the flavours make both of our dishes seem like good value.   The restaurant was dim, and fairly empty. The dark decor gave it a pub-like atmosphere, which contrasted with the big screen playing mostly K-Pop music videos. The service was friendly, although the snack we were brought before our meal was confusing. It seemed to be a pint glass full of fried, sugar-dipped spaghetti noodles. Not sure if it was a joke. It looked like a creative diy-wedding centerpiece, but they tasted like fried, sugar-dipped spaghetti noodles.  The second time we went to the Korean Kitchen it was awful. The big screen was playing Justin Bieber, and we were seated in a booth at the back. The seats had an awkward split between the cushions that made it hard to get comfortable. Our dining companion had bulgogi, with chicken substituted for pork. We ordered a pork and bean sprout hot pot, which was cooked on a burner at our table. However, after our companion had been served and nearly finished her meal, ours still wasn't done, so the served took it back to the kitchen to finish cooking it. We got it about ten minutes later, overdone and flavourless. Our friend described her meal as, \"okay.\"  In conclusion, not going back."}
{"text":"In the heart of Korean Town in downtown Toronto, The Korean Kitchen offers a taste of authentic  Korean Cuisine with a nice ambience to boot. Not only is the food good but the service is prompt and friendly...  We tried many dishes and all were good but the stand out for me was the Pork Belly with green onion and also the Bi Bim Bob!"}
{"text":"The Korean Kitchen has been open for about a year now (I think), and while it initially seemed to struggle in gaining traction in Ktown - having the unfortunate empty, ominous vibe, a newly opened restaurant can sometimes give off, it's definitely picked up momentum as the place is mostly packed now with lively diners flocking for its specialty, Jokbal (pork hock) and its eclectic stock of fun flavoured Sojus and Makgeollis. Drinkers take note: the LCBO no longer carries Makgeolli, so it's always advantageous to imbibe in this stuff when dining out at a place like The Korean Kitchen.   I've only tried the Jokbal here which is available in two different iterations - either with a gochujang based sauce, or with garlic. We chose the latter, and it really complemented the pork hock nicely when eaten as a wrap with the provided ssamjang, jalapenos and lettuce. As we dined here on a Friday night, it was overwhelmingly busy, and while I'm not an authority on the topic of restaurant management, I felt the service to be a bit discombobulated.   While the food and drinks were satisfyingly delicious, the accoutrements accompanying the Jokbal were so scarce - particularly the lettuce for wrapping the meat, and kimchi - that one would take a few bites, and then be stuck having to beckon the waitstaff for more. As it was so busy, I was reticent about flagging someone down, so I just enjoyed the rest of my meal, sans lettuce.  Do come and eat here though, as the food is delicious, and if you're seeking out a menu with a  likeness to what's trending food-wise in Korea, then this place is a must. Highly recommend the Jokbal and fruit Sojus/Makgeollis!"}
{"text":"My New GO TO Bar!  I am so happy that I have stumbled into this bar. My best friend and I were in the area eating and was looking for a place to have some drinks. We yelped and found that spot. It didn't have many reviews and the menu had us sold. Yogurt soju? Peach ice cream with soju? I mean... yes, please!!   We walked in and it was pretty busy. We managed to get spots! We were seated and they quickly gave us water and asked what we wanted. We started off with the yogurt soju (my best friend was soooo excited).   While we were waiting for our drink, a waitress approached us and told us that unfortunately there was a mistake and the seats we were sitting in, were reserved. They asked politely if we were able to move to the bar. not a problem! I mean, if you ask nicely, I'm probably going to say yes. We got our stuff and moved. The bar seating is not your usual. It was a lot bigger and wider? compared to other places. Our waiter kept apologizing, but really we didn't mind. We were seating facing a tv (which was playing K-pop videos). After we got out drinks, she even gave us free fries for the trouble! It was so sweet of them!!   We drank, laughed, drank some more and really enjoyed our night. It was a very chill vibe and you never felt rushed. Even when there were people waiting for seats! We order their hot&sweet chicken wings.. yum! They had a pretty big menu with a variety of things, skewers, hot pot, deep fried chickens, traditional Korean dishes and much more.   I am not even kidding about how much I love this place. Two days later, I took my boyfriend here.   Will be back for more drinks and more food!   Happy Belly :)"}
{"text":"The staff are extremely friendly and this is definitely a good place to casually drink with friends after a long day! Music isn't too loud so we can have actual conversations with each other instead of shouting!  Definitely recommend as it's a good atmosphere to relax"}
{"text":"Terrible from start to finish.  We were a group of 18 for a birthday dinner, reservation was made and clearly none of the staff were trained to handle this.  Place looks like a rundown bar.  To start off, our food orders. The waitress (one of the two who was working that Friday night) took orders from one end of the table, then the other end, then completely forgot about the people in the middle.   Then the actual food. The first couple dishes came, without cutlery or drinks. So the food got colder and colder and we had to ask for the cutlery, which arrived in a pitcher 5 mins later. No idea what the delay was as we were the only party present at that time. The side dishes were non-spectacular and all were quite bad. Overfermented/old kimchi, sour cold mashed potatoes, soggy sprouts.   Then the gamjatang fiasco. I had specifically ordered non-spicy, which the waitress #1 said was fine. However waitress #2 came to give us the gamjatangs. There were 4 and she was going to give me the last one. I asked her if that was the non-spicy one, and I kid you not, she gave me a side eye and sneered. She told me that it was spicy, like \"what's the problem?\". I say again I ordered non-spicy. She had the audacity to tell me to try it anyways and see if it's okay. What kind of request is this? So I try it, and tell her no. Give me a non-spicy one. One hour passes and I am still waiting for my soup and 2 other people for their dishes, which included chicken skewers and instant noodles in sriracha. My Korean friend asks waitress #2 as to where our food is, she comes back saying another 10 mins. What. So we keep waiting. Finally I had enough because I was no longer hungry and my friend asks waitress #2 where my soup is. She said she had no idea we were waiting on another gamjatang. Maybe she has goldfish memory or just is a terrible liar. My friend confronted her by saying, \"I heard you talking to the other waitress that there should be a non-spicy gamjatang here.\" And no flinch or acknowledgment from this waitress. Maybe she was shocked that someone understood her speaking Korean earlier. So we just cancelled the order cus this place clearly didn't care about it customers and everyone was inadequate. At one point, our table was told to not order anymore because the kitchen was backed up. Seriously!?   ...The cherry on top of the cake is that the bill came, with one non-spicy gamjatang on it."}
{"text":"I come here almost every week. This is a great place for gatherings during the day and at night. Awesome food and drinks, and they have an extensive menu for both drinks and food compared to other restaurants in the area, but what really makes this place nice is its ambiance (dim lighting, music, dark walls compared to the bright and neon decor of other restaurants in the area). Prices are fair and are prepared nicely. I usually get the kimchi stew and nappa cabbage stew which the chef kindly makes vegetarian when asked. My boyfriend recommends the fried rice, kimchi fries and tornado potato as a snack. The staff and the owner are incredibly kind."}
{"text":"Overpriced and below average!....this is not what Korean food is supposed to be and the empty dining room on a Saturday is a good indication of that..."}
{"text":"5 full stars! This place is awesome! This spot opened up not too long ago and is across from baskin robbins on christie. The Korean kitchen is one of the few restaurants that is currently carrying the ever so famous fruit flavoured soju, brands such as soonhari and jinro. This was all the rage in Korea the past summer, and now us Canadians can finally try it! Woo hoo!  We arrived around 6pm earlier today and it wasn't that busy and were seated in a booth (not very comfortable though). After looking at the menu, my bf wanted to order the garlic pork hock (pretty much the pigs leg including the feet) because it's not often that you'll see this on a menu. Apparently, this is a popular dish to get here. So we ordered that, an egg roll dish plus the grapefruit soju. We also had small side dishes to start and they also gave us deep fried spaghetti sticks coated in sugar! Very interesting..  Onto the food, when the garlic pork hock came, it also came with dipping sauce and a few pieces of lettuce to wrap if you want. The pork hock itself was very good, it wasn't dry and paired with garlic it has a sweet taste to it. But of course don't get this if you don't wanna have garlic breath for hours. The egg roll with sausage covered with ketchup and mayo was not too bad, but i'd skip that next time. The grapefruit soju however was bomb! Very sweet and you can definitely taste the grapefruit flavour. It goes down smooth and doesn't have that strong taste in your mouth like regular soju! But I'm a lightweight so I definitely cannot drink more than one bottle lol.   Finally, the service here is excellent! All the servers are friendly and they know how to smile! Yay! Our server would stop by occasionally asking if we need anything else, and giving us extra napkins. The owner is also very nice too, after asking if they carried this other Korean alcoholic drink - the one with the weed sign...(don't ask lol) He apologized and said they don't carry that atm..and he seemed genuinely sorry. He also gave us a small dish of donkatsu on the house! After eating, the owner personally went to see us out! So nice.. He did a good job training his staff on customer service because it's quite important here.   Recommend to come here at least once!"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. Now it NOT anymore.  Went to this place last night. The waitresses never brought us what we asked for(like a glass or napkins..) haha.  Pork hock which is one of their best menu was too hard to chew.. haha. And the chicken was smelly.  Literally it took 30 mins to get the bill and there was a mistake on our bill. They charged more.  Everything was awful there. Food.. service... Geez. I dont think I will be returning.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place when we had some extra time before meeting up with his cousin for dinner so we decided to have a drink. This place attracted us because of the picture of the flavored makgoli (korean rice wine). So we went in and we were greeted by the waitress (who was honestly really sweet.) We sat and down and we got water and silverware. We were looking through the drink menu and we decided to get the banana makgoli and seafood pancake. For korean people honestly the best combo! The seafood pancake was suprisingly really good. It was crunchy on the outside and spot in the inside. It had a good amount of seafood. The banana makgoli was out of this world. It taste like banana milk sold at korean market, but honestly so tasty but dangerous. I would drink this all night. HEHE. The restaurant is very authentic it has a lot of traditional korean drinks and korean food ( good for drinking). They also offer full bottle service too. I came here on a tuesday early night so it was slow but I definitely can tell it would be poppin on weekends. The sole reason why i give this place a 4 is because it is pricey. Im from Washington DC and the drinks and food is cheaper. Overall great experience if I am ever in Toronto i will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Korean Kitchen since it opened. This is the only bar around Christie that I go to and it's mostly due to the super kind manager :) I don't go as frequently as I used to but if you're craving Korean bar food and just want to chill then this is the right place to be."}
{"text":"I went there for an early dinner - I know it's a bar and grill so most of the food served are Korean bar food that would mostly be paired while you're drinking with your friends- even so the food needs to be good.   As a Korean trying these bar food I was quite disappointed. I'm from Chicago so there are a lot of Korean bars around too- these establishment knows that the food needs to be elevated and flavored well so the customers continue to come back-   I tried their kimchi fried rice- first off- don't use frozen vegetables (corn and peas)- authentic Korean kimchi fried rice don't have these vegetables but also why use frozen peas at all? What does it do to elevate the dish? They were hard and had no business to be in the dish. Also- did they use fish sauce? Fish sauce is so distinctive you can tell when it is over used in a dish. Again- why in a kimchi fried rice?   I also tried their crispy/spicy rice cakes on a skewer. The spicy/sweet sauce tasted like they were store bought. Even if I was drunk I wouldn't enjoy these dishes.   If you're in Korean town there are other options on that block you can check out."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night with 3 of my girlfriends. We did not realize how busy it would be so once we got there was had to wait but we were seated within 10 minutes!  Great customer service, the girl server really helped us with our menu decisions and was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Servers are super friendly. I felt very welcomed. Loved the seafood soondubu (tofu soup). Loved the vibe. Their selection of hip hop music was awesome."}
{"text":"After work on a midsummer Tuesday evening, I met my friend JJ on a slope in the Christie Pits - barely a botched football kick's distance from Korean Kitchen. I was looking for fried chicken. I found a new obsession. Smiling the instant we walked in: dimly lit, good fresh savoury smell from the kitchen in the back, bar clean and cool, K-Pop videos at low volume on a handful of flat screens. We took a pair of stools at the inexplicably empty bar. Tiny barmaid brought ice cold Sapporo draught, I ordered the spicy Korean Fried Chicken. In short order a whole portioned chicken appeared, piping hot on a platter. The crust was crisp and light - almost flaky - glazed with sweet and spicy Gojuchang sauce. Crunch. The chicken was stellar - juicy, tasty, just the right amount of sweet and heat. The bird disappeared, as did our second round of pints. I admit that this is not the world's most thorough review, as the entire experience revolved around beer and chicken charmingly served. But really there are certain afternoons, like that one, when someone slides perfect contentment in front of you... I'm grateful and going back again soon."}
{"text":"We came here after dinner and enjoyed a few rounds of drinks.  The grapefruit soju is AMAZING.  The citron one was average tasting.  Since we ordered drinks, they gave us a bulgogi poutine as a freebie.  The flavours were interesting, not enough cheese to make it a solid poutine, but interesting to try.  We also ordered the Yakult cocktail, it comes in a small jug - it didn't tastes very alcoholic so we mixed it with the bottle of citron soju, definitely improved the taste!  We ordered the chocolate fondue, and the chocolate wasn't the melted chocolate we expected, it was simply, Nutella.  There was a good selection of fruits for dipping."}
{"text":"I didn't know that this restaurant is a Bar also. They have ice cream and alcohol, I would like to try but with soda lol.  I came here kind of late, almost time to close but they still treated me very well.  We ordered 1 bulgogi hotpot and 1 rice cake. I require to put more chilli to more spicy in the hotpot. The banchan kind of boring for me, not too much and I also did not order more, just focused on main courses only.  About the hotpot, there is a quite of beef enough for 2 people. It taste good, for the beef and also the soup. If u like sour, I will recommend you the kimchi soup. In the soup also have grass noodle, and they give u rice for each one.  The rice cake is around 6$ and it will be more yummy if less sweet. It was a good snack for me :))).  1 thing I don't like from here is when I pay by debit, they require me the tips and couldn't say no.  For me, tips should be given from ur heart."}
{"text":"Came here after enjoying karaoke a few doors down. There weren't many people here Saturday night, which is something of a shame because it had great atmosphere (darkly lit, energetic beats, etc.) and really good food. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a drink while sharing ome of their appetizers, the chicken skewers. They were piping fresh, moist, and had a tasty sauce. Highly recommended. The signature move: they hand out a free side. Instead of plain jane bread, they give you a small bucket of thin crispy sticks covered in sugar. Possibly fried dough or something similar. Whatever it is, it's tasty and addictive."}
{"text":"Three stars for the friendly staff and fresh meat. Maybe I am not into Korean foods, the seafood hotpot was too sweet for me."}
{"text":"The best korean food i lve ever had. I highly recommend you to try the garlic jokbal. Banana makgeolli was fantastic."}
{"text":"first time eating here, needed to find a place with rice cake but without spiciness (husband likes it!) and this was first one I found where they had it with soy sauce! portion although advertised as \"snack\" was plentiful, sauce w beef pieces, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms snd sesame was divine! didn't wait long, servers were nice and helpful. returning next weekend for my bday!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was terrible.l, not sure if it was because I had higher standards from my past experience with other Korean restaurants. But cheap prices so if you want to forgo the service was cheap food and good pregame space, this should be sufficient."}
