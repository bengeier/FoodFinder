{"text":"This restaurant only opened this week. Having been in the restaurant business for 20 years here's some advice:  -get organized and increase line speed.  Look at the spatial arrangement of equipment and place it so it's no more than 3 steps away  - get uniforms.  If you want to portray professionalism than have staff wear a proper uniform otherwise you are showing desperation by not treating your team properly  - give awesome customer service including those that call. Telling a customer to phone back after a few minutes only to tell them you can't talk and hang up is totally wrong and uncalled for. A customer is a customer is a customer. I hope you never hang up on me when I order 200 burritos for a school lunch.   - anchor your iPads and place your debit terminal on a stand facing the customer.   My experience was terrible and it's obvious you didn't host a friends and family night to work out the kinks.  -I'm a customer and demand the food be served quick, hot and right. My first visit and you failed on all 3.   - I give you this feedback as constructive criticism to improve your operations.  Mom and pop mentality won't cut it especially when Mucho Burrito and Chipotle are nearby. You have to raise your game!  - sincerely a concerned customer who wants to see you succeed otherwise I could easily take my money and feedback with me with you never knowing what to improve."}
{"text":"Servers need to mention every customer : caution our reguler sizes are for kids only and adults are strictly adviced to order large portions. 2 teaspoon guacamole to any size burrito bowl is 2.95$. Chicken has no taste whatsoever!   Beware everyone. There are many better similar eateries in Mississauga! Just drive 10 min more and go to Chipotle at Squareone, better quality and quantity too. For a second day of restaurant opening quality, quantity and customer care sucks! Just have good presentation, so they get 1 star."}
{"text":"I went for a chicken Burrito,,it was bad,rice was hard like Rocks ,it tasted like  uncooked rice,the lettuce was turning bad,and the chicken? the chicken portions were very tiny,for a second I didn't know what I was eating,it was first and last time."}
{"text":"Stale and rancid food is sold here, when we notified the workers were not sure hoe to react obviously they work their and the owner never came on the phone ."}
{"text":"Small Portions. Tasted just acceptable. Not so fresh tasting proteins. Steep prices.  Owner was warm and friendly but that doesnt cut it.  Increase portion sizes and change the recipes on the proteins"}
{"text":"This place is alright. I had really high hopes based on the name. I was expecting a crazy fusion of middle eastern and mexican cuisine. However, there are not really that many crazy combinations available, which is a little disheartening. I ordered the lamb burrito. The lamb tasted good but it was not hot enough. My girlfriend ordered the sweet potato fries. These were really good.   I think the best way they can improve is to expand the menu a bit and aim towards more of a fusion flavour. This will separate them from the other shawarma and burrito places."}
{"text":"Opening by the end of January 2017.  I was at the tasting last week and the flavours of the Chicken, Beef and Lamb was fantastic.  Just have to make a choice of Burrito, Shawrama/Pita, Bowl or Taco, choose your protein then build your own with Fresher, Authentically Delicious fillers and sauces.   Jarritos drinks and Tres Leches for a dessert to grab and go with a variety of chips, cookies and brownies.    This concept is quick service, fresh and flavourful food and there will be franchises all across Ontario soon.    This will be the NEW concept trend in Canada!"}
{"text":"Visited on their 2nd day open. Obviously a lot of kinks to still workout but the food selection looks good and I was especially excited about the number of different toppings offered. A few notes. Charging for cheese is something that other burrito places don't do, and customers will quickly be put off by being asked to pay for something that is the norm everywhere else. Larger portions of toppings. A small teaspoon really isn't enough for a burrito."}
