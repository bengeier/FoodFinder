{"text":"Love this place! The tortas and hot dogs are my favorite and don't forget the cheesy fries with bacon!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice during my lunch break, and hopefully I don't have to come back. One of the bad things about this place is that the person that cooks your food is the same one the takes your order so if there is a lot of people trying to order, she would take every ones order first then she would start cooking and if she is cooking and some one shows up, she would leave your food unattended and take the order. Also the food that they served is not the best in taste and is really poor and not fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! From their Asada Dogs to tgf their tacos, everything is so good!! Hours are posted wrong but phone number is correct so call in advance because they work very long hours!"}
{"text":"Omg so freaking good!!! This is one of my favorite Sonoran dog spots in PHX. Simple menu, amazing food."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Sonora style hot dogs but on the go J spotted this lunch truck and decided Hey why not?! The Sonoran hot dogs are nothing like the Alley Dogs in LA and therefore I was very hesitant at 1st. The Sonora style hotdogs are not serve on a typical hot dog bun... it comes in a Bolillo style bun and it comes with pinto beans, tomatoes, green salsa, jalape√±o, mustard, mayonnaise, avocado and cotija cheese on top. A lot of ingredients if you ask me put it's pretty darn tasty. 

The kid who took my order was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place."}
