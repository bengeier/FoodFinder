{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Phoenix. Hiro's culinary skills are unmatched - he is easily my favorite chef in Arizona."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff with lots of seating.  We had a party of six - hungry, thirsty, and craving Sushi at 7pm on a Friday night.  Called to make reservations, 15 minutes later we were sitting down each with a large bottle of Asahi and Sake.  The fish was fresh and the rolls were creative and filling.  

The staff was both knowledgeable and provided great service with a smile."}
{"text":"This is the place... If you know sushi, you will love Shiro. If you don't, you will love Shiro.

If you remember Ayako from the AZ Biltmore, then you will know why the sushi here is so good. Three reasons, fresh, fresh and fresh...

I will elaborate. The fish is certainly among the freshest and best grade I've encountered anywhere. But, also, the vegetables used are always perfectly fresh and crisp. This is not very common in most sushi restaurants.

My only drawback is that Shiro is tucked in a strange location in a corner of a strip mall. However, the decor is beautiful and modern.

Say hello to Hiro when you visit..."}
{"text":"We found Hiro from Shiro - he's now working at Tokyo Lobby in Glendale!!!"}
{"text":"This is the replacement of Ayako's / Akita Ya.  

The food, as always are phenomenal. However the location and the settings lacks the Original Japanese Aura.

And where the hell are the Teppanyaki Tables? :)

Anyways despite a few setback i still go to this place for their one of a kind Spider Roll and their Euphoric Shrimp Tempura."}
{"text":"Really great service.  Shige, the owner is a very gentle sushi slayer at the counter that really knows how to cut up his sashimi.  Huge fresh portions of sashimi that is sure to be a hit for a sushi novice or expert.

Other things tried-

Eel cucumber roll- pretty tasty.

California roll- eh. not my choice.

Agadashi Tofu- average

Scallops in birds nest- very tasty and great, recommended

Miso Black Cod- tasted not as fresh as the sashimi, but still above average

Chicken Karrage- it was more like chicken strips Japanese style, a littler under average

Overall, this place is quiet with pretty authentic food, but the service is top notch. Extremely friendly and personable.

I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Yelp expectations.  Sometimes that works against a place.  Gotta say, I wasn't that impressed.

The service was fabulous.  I felt like I was the only one in the place.  Sure, the crowd was light, but it was exceptional.

So here's the run down:

Miso soup - the best ever, props to Megan M for the tip.  Really exceptional.

Sea Bass - first time, pretty good, but a little lacking in flavor.

Unagi - very good, a little too thin and therefore a little crispier than I'm accustomed.

Salmon Roe - the best I've ever had.  It was buttery tasting.

Tuna - a bit stringy, not very tasty

Yellowtail - basically my favorite sushi, a let down here

Tobiko w/quail egg - about the worst on the plate, too much lumpy rice.

A little on the pricey side, but not over the top.

They do have Asahi, always a plus.  The crowd at the bar were chatting away as though they were good friends when it later appeared they hadn't known each other until this evening.  Tribute to the atmosphere and the service."}
{"text":"First to review, now the last.
Stopped by to see Hiro and Shige at \"Shiro Sushi\" last night and there is a note on the door.

\"Couldn't make it through the slow times\".

Too bad.
Hopefully we will find them elsewhere soon.
