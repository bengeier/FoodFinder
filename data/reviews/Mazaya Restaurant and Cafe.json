{"text":"Had the super shawarma dinner platter to go .  It was $15.99 so I was expecting a dinner. What I got was a long but tiny sandwich with only a small amount of meat in it and a lot of sauce. It was mainly a sauce sandwich. A small amount of the other ingredients normally found on a shawarma were served on the side in one of the tray compartments. The other compartment had a combination of more sauce and ketchup. The main tray compartment contained the sandwich and some fries. The dinner platter was really only a sandwich and fries. Not very impressive considering the price. The staff was ok (seemed like they might be the owner's family) and the place looked ok but the shawarma was quite disappointing compared to others I'd had in the same area."}
{"text":"Been there previously 3-4 times and the experience, service was AMAZING by the servers until last night we went and we were a group of 5. The service was amazing that night until I went to the cash to pay and I was approached by one of the employees \" possible a manager, I've never seen him before\" and he advised me if I could respect my self next time and not to cuddle with my girlfriend, here is the term of cuddling in his eyes is I had my arms around her shoulder and not even a kiss as I warned her that this is not our tradition especially in an Arab place.  

I listened to what he said and he was saying how this store an arab store and we need to be more respectful not to mention I'm an arab as well. It was a total disrespect and I was in a total disappointment. Now he totally lost us as customers and I've advised all my arab friends not to go there and just go back to Jude instead. 

It's a shame as my friends and I had this place the go to and now it's just a history. 

Thanks to an amazing servers who always been really good to us, but this person approach was horrible as he judged us incorrectly."}
{"text":"I am a regular at shisha lounges in mississauga. Would rate this place in my top 3 shisha lounges here along with mazaj and fusion.

I am going to review this place after coming here for the third time. 

1. Shisha : Bluemist - mint. 5/5. Fantastic flavor.  Fresh and long lasting. Ice pack- cold.

2. Food: even better than the shisha. We ordered the following-
      A: Makneesh- cheese.  Freshly made in front of us. Full of cheesy goodness
      B: kibbeh- beef cutlet. Very flavorful. One of the best I've had. 
      C: chicken souvlaki. Not really a souvlaki.  More like chicken Tikka.  Well marinated and delicious. 

3. Service: friendly and fast. 

I will be a regular  here and so should you."}
