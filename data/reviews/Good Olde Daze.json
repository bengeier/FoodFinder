{"text":"Great food.  Burgers, wings and garden salid with Cajun chicken are all #1 in size and taste"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Monday afternoon to try the lunch special. The food was decent, I have certainly had worse burgers. But the service was just downright bad. Why be so rude to a customer when I was THE ONLY CUSTOMER. Maybe that's why I was the only customer. Not planning a return, that's for sure."}
{"text":"One of our stops while bar hopping down State Road in Parma. Just your typical dive bar. Super cheap drinks. We ordered whiskey and ginger ale, gin and tonic, and vodka red bull. The total came out to only $7.50! A nice guy sitting at the bar ended up picking up our tab. There are a lot of locals, or as I like to call them, townies, and mostly guys so be prepared, you will get hit on. There's a pool table and an outdoor area. We didn't really stay too long after the first round of drinks. Only downside is that it is cash only. Aside from that, I wouldn't mind stopping by for more drinks, if my budget is tight."}
{"text":"Last night I decided to try out the new #1 wings in town. I ordered and than waited an hour and never got any food. Then the waitress Kim gave me some excuse as to why. Supposedly there were 25 orders ahead of ours. There wasn't 25 more tables than ours. Plus can't fryers hold more than one order of wings? I am sympathetic if you just forgot to put my order in. Don't treat me like I'm stupid. I left and never did get any wings. If they are the best wings I'll never know because I'll never go back."}
{"text":"If your looking for food one notch above a bag of chips then this place is for you. If your looking for good bar food that's a bang for your buck, pass!  They got my order wrong and not very filling at 8.50$ a burger."}
{"text":"Laid back dive bar. CASH ONLY. Good food, great wings. 75 cent pool table. Darts. Arcade games"}
{"text":"Legitimately the perfect crispy wing. These are some of the best wings I have ever had. Twice fried to create that perfect crispy skin with no breading (message to other bars: please stop breading your wings, you're embarrassing yourselves). This is a hidden gem in Parma. Well hidden if you aren't in Parma, I think it is common knowledge that some of the best bar food in the state is right here in Good Olde Daze if you're from the area! I wish I could add more stars tbh"}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly with my niece for the lunch special. Burger, any way, fries and a soda for $6.50.  We got the everything that had bacon cheese mushrooms and the usual lettuce tomato etc.  Phenomenal!!  Truly one of the best burgers in Parma. Neck and neck with Griller's which I also reviewed.  Now that I am a vegetarian I love the combo appetizers which is a wonderful basket of breaded veg. I cant stop in without a cherry bomb. Or 2. Or 3....whatever. When the owner Tommy is there don't be surprised if he comes up to you and asks how you liked it. He takes pride in his food. They have the top rated wings in the area so be sure to have some!! Just an all around comfortable spot to have some really great food and drink!!!"}
{"text":"You have to try Thursday night wing night!   The garlic sauce is incredible. I've never eaten anything there that I didn't enjoy. Great jukebox, good prices, and fun locals. Try the apple pie shot too :-)"}
{"text":"How my dinner went:  - Took about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. - Got a watered down Coke. - Ordered chicken noodle soup. It was basically diluted chicken broth, parsley, celery and raw carrots. No actual chicken. Basically $5.50 for water they boiled a chicken in and slapped carrots on top of. - Ordered a burger. It came 5 minutes after the regulars at the other table got theirs. They ordered their's 20 minutes after mine. Over cooked & dry, and the bun was stale & far too big for the tiny burger. Only would have been worth it on $1.50 burger night. But hey, I got a lot of pickles..... - Their chicken wings were actually good. Only redeeming part of our meal.  I imagine it's only enjoyable there if you're getting blasted."}
{"text":"It looks like your typical dive bar, but their food is phenomenal.  The wings are hands-down the best in town.  They're always super crispy and their garlic sauce is to die for!  I also enjoy their burgers and fish fry during lent.  Also, get the apple pie shots for dessert, they are the easiest and most delicious shots you will ever have!"}
