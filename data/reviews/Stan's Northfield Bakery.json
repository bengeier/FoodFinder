{"text":"We've had nothing but amazing cakes from Stan's.  They have amazing customer service and take the time to work with you to make the perfect cake designs.  My out of town family asks us to bring cakes from Stan's for family events because they always taste great.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped here once, and do not plan on going back. The baked goods were okay, but not fantastic. The same goes for the pierogis. The sign out front said that they were, \"Cleveland's Best,\" buy they were short on filling and long on dough. Ugh. On top of that, the employees were rude and rather unpleasant."}
{"text":"The way a bakery should look, feel, smell and taste, especially if you're into donuts and pierogies!"}
{"text":"Long time customer. Pierogis and sweets are fantastic. Highly recommend the bacon and cheddar pierogis. A little more pricey than I'd like, but well worth the money."}
{"text":"I can't talk up this place enough, they hit the nail on the head every time with all the crazy ideas I throw there way. They have a lifetime customer right here."}
{"text":"Best apple fritter I've ever had. Fantastic little walk in deli atmosphere with pretty large selection of baked goods and prepared foods. Great value, and the woman behind the counter was beyond kind and helpful explaining the selections. Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"It's bad enough the place only takes cash, but please make sure you know exactly how much you are being charged for items.  They have a tendency to overcharge you. The first time it happened I let it go, but then today I get charged for 5 cookies when I only purchased 3...just saying.  I'll start looking elsewhere for baked items...especially cookies...as hard cookies are never good."}
{"text":"Tiny little old-school looking bakery in a strip mall.  I've driven past this place literally hundreds of times, and was finally convinced to stop in bc of their relative success in the \"Cleveland's Favorite Donut\" competition.  Not an overwhelming selection of donut flavors, but they had all the basics, and a few paczki (even in October).  I tried a \"spicy pumpkin fry cake\" donut and a glazed white cream filled.  The cream filled donut was very sweet and heavy.  The other one tasted like a plain donut, no hint of any kind of spice.  They can't compare to my favorite George's, but they were both still pretty good.  I also got a pack of potato-parlsey-garlic frozen pierogies to try later.  $7.79 seemed pretty steep for 6 pierogies, but I'm used to Mrs. T's.  They had at least a dozen flavors in the freezer case, most of which I would have liked to try.  I took off a star due to their \"3% charge for credit card\" sign, which is also the reason I won't go back.  If that won't bother you, then check it out."}
{"text":"We started going to Stan's Bakery about 20 years ago. I'm pretty sure it's been around much longer than that which is a sign they've been doing something right.

It's fairly cramped inside, but you're simply there to pick up some bakery and go, so no need for any ambiance. 

They have fantastic kolackys (apricot and cheese-filled are awesome), an assortment of donuts, cookies, and pies. They're also known for their pierogis, which have won awards over the last decade. But to me -- Stan's will always be about the bakery -- second only to Mom's!"}
{"text":"I only get to come a few times a year as I now live out of state, but every time I come home, I pick up breakfast at Stans! Make sure to bring cash as there's a charge to use credit, but the paczis are worth it!"}
{"text":"I needed a cake made for my daughters birthday and emailed Leslie at Stan's Bakery. She went back and forth with me numerous times to get exactly what I wanted within the price range I wanted as well. The cake was AWESOME. Not only tasting but it looked great too. I would highly recommend Stan's for cakes!"}
{"text":"Yelp hours may be wrong, stopped by this morning, Saturday at 6am and not a soul in site. Don't think they actually open at 5.  Just wanted you to be aware."}
{"text":"Stan's has the best Kolaczki and Paczki (this is the correct spelling, people) in the area, at least on the east side. All the Slavic Village shops closed down which is rather sad. 
You have to drive 1/2 hour out to Northfield to get them but it could be worse. Small little place thats been at this corner since 1961. In July of 1961, Stan's Northfield Bakery was established by Stanley, Helen, and their son David. Everything is made from scratch. 
They feature at least a dozen varieties of Paczki and they are frequently featured in area Best off lists. The apple, apricot and raspberry are exceptional. They cost about 1.50 each.
Quick note on how to heat pieorgi: They are sold in a package of about a dozen. Heat a pan of boiling water but not a rapid boil. Place the pierogi in the boiling water briefly until they float to the top. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon. Bathe in melted butter and plate. Do not pan fry them, do not deep fry them."}
{"text":"I used to think paczki were only for Lent. Not so!! Stan's has them all the time, along with delicious donuts and bakery. They win my vote for having cookies for the Royal Wedding. Yep, I celebrated by eating Meghan and Harry's faces on a delicious sugar cookie. 

If you like homemade pierogi but don't have time to MAKE pierogi, Stan's has multiple options available in the freezer!"}
{"text":"An area institution.  Stan's is THE PLACE to go for a birthday cake.  It'll look great AND taste great.  If you've been to a bunch of kids birthday parties, you've had that tastless, sugary \"bakery cake\". 

An eastern european bakery, they make great nut and poppy rolls.  Very solid bread.  For me though, Stan's is all about doughnuts and pierogies.  Perfect cake doughnuts!  The pierogies are in the freezer case, mostly just the typical potato & cheese variety, nothing exotic.

My only knock is on the cookies.  Enticing-looking cookies (big, pretty decoration), but not as tasty as they look.  The smaller cookies (like on their cookie trays), I like though.  Oh, and the Kolachy are great too.

If you're a local, and get your cake from Walmart or Giant Eagle, shame on you!"}
{"text":"I usually rely on a west side baker for all my cakes, but thought I would try a new place. My standards are pretty high so I don't usually expect bakeries to meet them.  I took a chance ordering my daughter's 1st birthday smash cake, cupcakes, and frosted cookies from Stan's. Stan's stuck out, because I recently had one of their \"Big Dupa\" doughnuts...heaven on earth! The Big Dupa is a cassata doughnut, that I would rather have over cassata cake any day!This should be on every \"Must Try\" list in Cleveland. 

I gave the baker a picture of what I wanted (A bee hive cake/cupcakes) and Stan's exceeding my high standards ten fold! Not only did the bee hives come out exactly what I pictured, but even better. The next test was how it all tasted. This sealed the deal. The cake tasted moist and delicious! The frosting was sweet (which I like) and the cookies were the BEST!  They reminded me of Osman's Pies in Hudson (long closed) they used to sell my favorite cookies. These are better! The other highlight, everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Really great shop decorated in  personal items from local stuff and family pictures. The shop is very small and it's kind of overwhelming. I'm not a sweets person but I had heard a lot of great things so I went. I didn't like that I felt the lady was rushing my order. She said she needed to know what I was having so she could pick the right box. I don't really care what box you use or if you wrap it in that obnoxious thread, but I do care that you don't rush me. All the little pastries were extremely flakey and we couldn't taste the filling.  I like the concept and I'm happy they've done well, but not for me."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Stan's bakery is here and are so close to me. They have so many yummy baked goods. Recently I ordered a cake last minute for my sister birthday. The cake turned out beautiful and delicious! The price was great too! Don't hesitate to try them people. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great homemade pierogis. Nice little family owned and operated business."}
{"text":"Stan's is so good. Whenever I am home, I try to stop by and get a donut. That they are decorated in Cavs colors during the NBA finals (and perhaps the whole basketball season) is fun. My mom grew up down the street, and she has great stories about going to Stan's after elementary school across the street and middle school around the corner. I transferred to private school before middle school, but in elementary school I did one day a week at the middle school for the gifted program, and stopping at Stan's after school was the best. Nothing beats a Snapple and a cookie when you are a kid! 

We've bought so many family cakes here, including the cake for my brother and sister-in-law's rehearsal dinner in Dayton. And it wouldn't be the Memorial Day parade without waiting in line for a donut! The customer service here is excellent. 

Cash is preferred here, but I think it is possible to pay with a credit card."}

Located in the suburb of Northfield, a thirty minute drive from Downtown Cleveland in average traffic, Stan's Northfield Bakery occupies a tiny space amidst Laundromats and Autoparts Stores on Olde 8 Road, the family owned and operated site generating the majority of its traffic from a nearby middleschool and other local businesses...not to mention accolades for Northeast Ohio's very best Pierogis and other Eastern European specialties.

Open since 1961, baker Stanley Srodek's recipes all time-honored traditions handed down from his Polish-Catholic upbringing to the current third-generation ownership, a first look at Stan's is like a step back to simpler times as glass and metal cases nearly fill the entirety of the retail space with store windows also lined in sweet temptations, the back-half of the building reserved for baking that starts before 3am Monday through Saturday.

Even smaller than it looks from the outside, a Standing Room Only sign probably as warranted as any on the door, it was after brief perusal of several options that an order was conveyed to an elderly woman behind the counter, a total of eight items tallying $13.45 Cash and taken to a nearby park to be devoured.

Dining solo at the time, and thus unable to partake in several styles of Pie or luxurious looking Nut Bread, it was instead with four cookies that the tasting got started, the Snickerdoodle and Seasonal Butter Drop absolutely perfect with meltingly soft centers surrounding by crisp rings while the Peanut Butter and Oatmeal Craisin were equally well crafted, though not particularly different from those that can be found at most good bakeries.

Intrigued by the \"Fritter,\" essentially a fried Apple Streudel that eats lighter than the traditional version but comes off a bit greasy due to cooking oil flooding the pocket's fold, a better bite was found in the moist Pumpkin Fry-Cake slathered in Buttercream and Cinnamon Streusel while year-round Paczki virtually unheard of elsewhere are every bit as good as those found around Lent in Polish neighborhoods, the nut paste version itself good while the \"Big Butt\" named to many local 'best-of' lists offers the pillowy lard-fried treat sliced in half and wrapped around a cloud of Vanilla Meringue."}
{"text":"I grew up with Stan's.  It is a must stop every time I am in the area.  The doughnuts are awesome but the pierogi and fresh Kielbasa are where it's at! I miss home already thinking about them."}
{"text":"Old school bakery, I picked up donuts for the kids but didn't want to go to chain store. I found them online and drove from Aurora and it was worth the time. I need to go back for their pirogies."}
