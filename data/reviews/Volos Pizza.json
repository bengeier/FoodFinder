{"text":"Got a take out order. Plain cheese pizza. Was borderline inedible. Will never go back, threw out half the pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious family run pizza place in Bankview- if your in the area and looking for pizza Volos is definitely the place!"}
{"text":"This small independent pizza joint is exactly were people should eat.  Stay away from chains! The Knob Hill special is awesome - I don't even like some of those toppings on other pizzas, but Volos does it right!  Heads Up!: you are getting 100% North American (... Canadian) pizza here.  Thick buttery crust, a lot of toppings, especially on the Knob Hill Special, and smothered in cheese.  We had 4 adults and 2 kids and the XL fed us all ... with leftovers."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have had in Calgary since moving here 1.5 years ago.  This pizza is comparable to Romeos or Cosmo's from Vancouver Island.  Cheesy, hot, saucy and delicious.  Great old school pizza joint where the say 'hello' on the phone and you order from a nice lady :) Courteous delivery guy too.  Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Our family has been eating Volos Pizza for years. The service is prompt, the pizza is delicious & it's family run.  Just last night my son & I were out for a longish bike ride & as we were returning home he suggested we pop in, order a pizza & have it delivered. By chance, fellow cyclist & owner Lampros was there. He suggested that the Knob Hill Special would probably hit the spot. When asked if we wanted medium or large ... we wondered - but of course choose the large. I thought we could use whatever leftovers we had on Friday nights camping trip to Keho Lake.  Lampros immediately suggested whatever we don't want - put in the fridge immediately prior to the pizza getting cold - it would be delicious as leftovers.  We ordered & rode home. A quick shower & pizza delivered to the door.  It was yummy as always & we got snacks for tonight's camp adventures around Keho Lake!   I love to camp ... but if you don't ... go with a day old Volos Pizza & be happy!"}
{"text":"This is now my favourite pizza in Calgary. The toppings are generous and they brown the crust and cheese perfectly."}
{"text":"This is the best, most consistently delicious pizza I have ever had. Pizza tastes are different for each person, but this small, independent pizza place is the best in the city, and in my opinion the country."}
{"text":"This pizza was actually pretty damn good but not what I had expected this is a toppings under the cheese kind of place but unlike most pizza of that nature has gooey cheese. The top layer of cheese the very top is crispy and crunchy almost like they baked a cheese crisp layer and then topped the pizza with it. I have never had pizza like this but overall it's pretty great. The crust is also rich and buttery with a nice crunch and no in anyway doughy.  I highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"I've lived within a short walk from this place for 5 years now. My favourite pizza in the city by far. The only thing I wish they had was wings. Though having tried the lasagna, it is a great alternative to the primary offering. This though, is serious pizza. You should try it, stay away from the chains!"}
{"text":"Not good at all!!... I definitely cannot recommend it... The crusty was too thick for my taste... And the pizza in general not good at all.. The toppings were just not enough... I think there are many many places waaaay better than this for pizza in Calgary.. I hope I don't have to eat those pizzas again!!"}
{"text":"Had the Mexican this week and it was great. If you like the non chain pizza restaurants like me, this is a great spot!  Happy to recommend."}
