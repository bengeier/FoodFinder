{"text":"Best NY style pizza I've had in the PHX area. Very friendly, appears to be family run. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to the establishment a handful of times. Today drew the line seeing the owner, in his work clothing and an employee later confirmed it was him, was seen arguing with a man in front of the store.

I have not seen such loud and profane language in sometime. The other gentleman was calm and polite while the store owner was yelling and screaming profane language. This was in front of my children and was making quite the seen. Apparently it was over a parking dispute because they park their work vans in front of other stores blocking customer parking rather than in the back.

In fact I saw some people at the Superpumper filming this. I hope they will upload this scene on youtube. I for one will never bring my children to this establishment again after the profane tirade I witnessed today."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had! My family and I just happen to come in here and were treated just like family. They were so nice and we ordered the meat filled pizza. It was amazing! It fed three adults and three little kids and we still had leftovers. Lorenzo himself made the pizza and there is nothing to compare. So delicious! So glad we found this place. We will be back even though it's location is far away from where we live. It is worth it. So good!"}
{"text":"Small Italian restaurant with freshly made pizza, salads, appetizers and entres. Very well prepared. Service is friendly. Will definitely return. My wife and I shared a bottle of Italian red wine, antipasto salad, a calzone and Philadelphia cheese steak hogi. Large portions. Had to take half home.

{"text":"Great NY pizza...the owner Lorenzo grew up in Sicily and the pasta dishes he came up with beat any upscale italian place in town. Priced very reasonably and everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"I'm originally from NJ, so I love NY style pizza. This place comes very close! Love the white pizza - comes with chunks of Ricotta cheese like it should! It's rare to find this kind of white pizza. Also tried the caprese salad, pretty good, wish it had reduced balsamic vinager instead of what seemed to be balsamic vinaigrette dressing, but it was still refreshing. I would recommend this place! The classic pepperoni pizza is tasty as well."}
{"text":"I believe this is the best pizza place I have found in Arizona. We go as often as we can. Workers are VERY friendly and I feel very comfortable there. The garlic knots are amazing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST experience ever!. Came in and placed an order to go. After I was abruptly and rudely cut off when asking if I could substitute one topping and told, \"no, you can eliminate something or pay for any additions\", I placed my order. I was told it would take 20 minutes. So I sat in the seat facing the order window for to-go customers and waited patiently. I watched two couples come in after me and leave before me when I finally stood up and asked for my order, at this point it had been over 30 min. No surprise, she went over and picked up my pizza that had been sitting in the warmer (which is useless) for over 15 minutes. I watched every box go in 
and wondered why so many had not been picked up yet. When the woman handed it to me I asked \"so for my next visit, am I supposed to check with you on if my food is ready?\" Her curt reply was \"no, I was getting to your order\".
Needless to say the pizza was room temperature  when I got it home and it wasn't anything to write home about.
The owners were rude and indifferent. I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Just four days ago while dining in the waitress couldn't make change from a $20 bill had to ask another waitress for help and they had to use a calculator. Now I picked up an order and the young man who is obviously new, failed to charge me for the sausage on my pizza and after running the initial charge on my credit card I was informed by the owner that I had to run another charge for $2.50, rather than comping it because it was their mistake.Besides the fact that we eat in or take out for the last 10 years that we lived here.
This place never ceases to amaze me. The advantage is they are the closest Pizza and Wing Place around."}
{"text":"Good variety of pizza and pastas, friendly family like staff serving authentic Italian dishes. Put on your must visit list."}
{"text":"Waited 6 minutes in line to pick up pizza, which had wrong ingredients. Lots of people in kitchen with no coordinarion.  Pizza was bland and over cooked."}
{"text":"By far this pizza joint is the best in the valley. The best New York style pizza I have ever had. You will not be disappointed. I live in the West side of town and I drive all the way to Scottsdale when out of towner come to visit and ask for the best pizza in town, and they never leave PHX disappointed. Hell yeah. Feel the love ppl and try it out for yourself. You will find yourself writing a review just like me. Good Job Lorenzos..."}
{"text":"Best Sicilian pizza in Scottsdale.  Just moved here and Lorenzo's has become our favorite Italian restaurant.  Plus, they are one of the only delivery places in the Cave Creek area.  Love going into local places where the owner greets you.  Great Place!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent. The pizza was tasty and I really enjoyed their crust. The garlic knots are fantastic, and our server was very nice. The ambience is a bit odd though. Even though there were several other customers, it was eerily quiet, and felt kind of weird to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Got ripped off and didn't have time to ask them to fix it because I was almost going to be late to my friends wedding and they couldn't even keep my glass of WATER filled. Was not able to locate their health code rating which freaked me out a bit. Probably not going to go back there ever again"}
{"text":"We just ordered pizza for pick up and came home to discover the pizza was burnt and not even edible by appearance. We contacted Lorenzos and they were very hesitant to provide a new pizza. In addition we requested the pizza to be delivered since my family and I were not well today and they wouldn't oblige. The Lorenzos representative on the phone could absolutely care less and even knew that we ate there a minimum of once a week. I made it clear that the service and attitude would cause me to NEVER go back. Again, they didn't care.

There are many pizza places to choose from up in this area and would never suggest to anyone to eat there. Quality and service from a supposed family restaurant was completely ignored and because of that its not worthy of your time!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Ny style Pizza, but i do eat other styles as well.  As long as the food is edible, I'm pretty satisified.  Having said that,  I can say that this place has Awful tasting Pizza.  They might as well have dipped their Pizza in Salt, it was salty as hell.  Their Garlic Knots were salthy too, and very greasy.   I can't understand how this place stays open.  Its not NY style, and it just tastes bad period!!"}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly. The beer was cheap. The garlic knots were pretty good, and the fried zucchini was just OK. 
BUT, and I LOVE pizza, the Gran-Ma pizza is worth a trip here... from out of state! It's incredible, very flavorful, and definitely the single best pizza I've had in AZ (and I've lived here all my life - well almost - since I was 10 and was just starting to appreciate a good pizza). I've always been a big fan of Fatso's, and it's pretty close to home, but they have nothing like the Gran-Ma. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place for delivery!  They put you on hold for close to 5 min when you call, then it takes well over an hour to deliver the food (we live less than 5 miles away). The food is decent but not worth the hassle of having it delivered."}
{"text":"Service was so horrible we walked out. They don't value their customers. Walked in sat there for 10 minutes nobody came to our table to take our order. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place and they deliver!!!! They have the best  pizza. I'm originally from NY. so I'm picky about my pizza. They have catered 2 of my kids Birthday parties which included pizza, pasta dishes, chicken parmesan & sausage and peppers. ALL of my guests LOVED it!!! I will continue to have them cater all my parties & order pizza from them ever Friday night!!!"}
{"text":"The wings were pretty tasty and the only highlight. We ordered delivery on a Friday night and my fear about it taking much longer than expected was not realized... It came right on time (an hour) But we ordered the gran-ma pizza and it was about the least enjoyable pizza I've ever had. Big gobs of watery sauce on top of pizza dough that tastes like it came from a freezer. Rubbery and cheap. Mozzarella slices that weren't fully melted onto the pie. I can't get the taste out of my mouth fast enough from that garlicky sauce. I will never order this pizza again. Too many pizza places near here to try twice. My wife and I love pizza and this was a very bad pizza."}
{"text":"Late and lousy  
ordered a \"gourmet \" pizza for delivery @ 5:45 and told it would be there in 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  It finally arrived at 8:00.....  It was horrible period........
One and done with this place"}
{"text":"Great straight forward, East Coast pizza place.  NY, NJ & Philly pizza fans will feel at home."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Probably the best I have had in Arizona. Lived in Az all my life and have eaten a bunch of pizza from many pizza joints and there is a big difference at Lorenzo's. I prefer just cheese, its that nice thinner crust, large pieces and slightly oily, the kind you fold in half like a taco to eat. Certainly my favorite pizza in the valley."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. They have a great selection of slices  until 4pm. The white pizza with a side salad (tip, ask to add mozzarella) was amazing. They made us a fresh order of garlic knots despite having a plethora on display. The sandwiches come on amazing soft, yet flaky bread. I dipped everything in a big bowl of marinara and was in heaven. The staff was super friendly. 

Definitely not a first date place, but the best NY style pizza I've found in AZ. I'm a little bummed I've driven by so many times. We'll definitely be getting takeout and delivery regularly.  They'll also sell their dough to take home. I'm in love with this place."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very friendly people. Super good pizza. The usual, cheese pizza, quite delicious. Try the specialty pizzas. You won't be sorry. Chicken Pesto Pizza! Buffalo Chicken Pizza! Baked Ziti Pizza!  Truly masterpieces waiting to be discovered by other pizza lovers."}
{"text":"I Agree with Most of the Negative Posts about this Establishment. Having Owned a NY Style PIizzeria in the Chicago Area , I Know How It Should Be. Every Time I Order for Delivery the Time Is Misquoted. This last Time was quoted 45 to an Hour and it was 1 Hour plus 20. For the Marginal Product they are Serving I Don't Know how this Place stays In Business. Never Again !"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at this cute little pizza shop. I went this Sunday at around 3pm, and it was pretty busy. My friend and I seated ourselves and had to order at the counter...no big deal. The guy was helpful and let us make special requests for the salad and pasta dishes that we ordered. I had the pasta with veggies, and added shrimp. My friend had a garden salad with extra cheese. The food was excellent and I would order those dishes again! My only complaint was that he added a lot of cauliflower to my pasta dish, and I only asked for broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, and tomatoes. It had very little broccoli, no tomatoes, and a ton of cauliflower!!! I am not a fan of cauliflower...at least not in my pasta. I would like to try the dish next time, as ordered! However, it was a cute little place and they were friendly. This is sometimes hard to find in North Scottsdale.

The pizza looks amazing....maybe I will try that next time:)"}
{"text":"My kids like cheese pizza, I like pepperoni, I asked for pepperoni on 1/4 and I said I would gladly pay full price but they said no we can only do half. Although the pizza is good, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.  Each year when we vacation in Scottsdale, we come back.  The spaghetti bolognese is to die for,  salad is always fresh cut,  and their garlic knots are indescribable. Finish with a cannoli and you'll be back for more.  Out of this world personalized service and GREAT food."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! I HIGHLY recommend this place for great food at an affordable price. The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly. I like that I can take my kids there because they are kid friendly but if I want to take some friends there for an adult only night...I can too! Great place...really can't say enough...just go try it...you will be extremely pleased!"}
{"text":"Our neighborhood pizza joint and we love it.  Family run and it shows, they just care!  Support these guys, they work hard.  Love the garlic knots and chicken parmesan too."}
{"text":"This place is great and delicious! Real New York pie!  Also, the atmosphere is awesome and the place is so cute"}
{"text":"just got a roasted vegetable pizza with marinara sauce. The pizza is top notch!!! Excellent!!! The lady at the counter was very nice to me and the service was reasonably quick. I want to give this pizzeria a 5 star rating :-)"}
{"text":"Terrible almost inedible pizza.  So disappointed! Have had pizza and pasta delivery for years and always was great.  This delivery took almost 2 hours even though they said would take 45 minutes.  Pizza was burnt and soggy. Crust inedible.  At least we did not gain a lot of weight. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was here recently and was disappointed the spaghetti sauce is way too spicy for my daughters and the chicken wings tasted like they were frozen and put in the oven and definitely didn't taste fresh"}
{"text":"The bonus here is the friendly welcoming service.
We found this Italian restaurant using a Groupon....and what a pleasant surprise!  We were first served \"garlic knots\"... a delicious baked bread dough rolled in olive oil, garlic, and spices.  We also had the shrimp scampi (14.95) which included a very generous salad, and a calzone (6.95) which was almost 12\" wide.  Both items were well prepared and tasty.

Judging from the regular patrons that visited the restaurant ton dine in and take out, it is very apparent that they all enjoy supporting this local family type restaurant....and it is apparent that the restaurant is in the business of taking care of their customers.  We are visiting the Phoenix area from the San Francisco Bay Area and will definitely add this as a place to eat (and support) whenever we are in town.  We suggest you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Fans:  We have been to Lorenzo's Pizza and Pasta several times over the last two years.  Each time we visited the food has been consistent.  

Service has recently improved, since it appears more people are eating in, rather than taking out.   There were three servers working the night we went, which was a Thursday night, so it was efficient and our food was delivered hot.   

This is a small local pizza joint, so if you are going with a large group you may want to call ahead so they can push some tables together for you.  

We have tried several different items off the menu, but we feel what they do best are the pizzas.  On our last trip we ordered the large gourmet vegetarian pizza.  Lots of veggies, thin crust, but not too thin that it was crispy, and not a lot of crust edge showing (just enough to satisfy wanting a bite of crust with nothing on it, but not so much crust to feel the ingredients should have come out further).  

The size of this pizza would easily serve four adults, so for the price it is a good inexpensive meal.  

We also enjoy their garlic knots served with marinara sauce.  If you order some, ask that they be made fresh/hot.  They do not taste as good at room temperature or cooler.  

Casual dress - what ever you are wearing, work attire, shorts, all fine.  

TVs - sports are usually on the big screen TV.  

Overall, when we are hungry for pizza we don't hesitate to go to Lorenzo's for a casual lunch or dinner.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Customer service is just about everything to me - which is why I am giving Lorenzo's 5 stars. I ordered for take out this evening and when I went to pick up the order, the place was PACKED. Every table filled, people in line and more streaming in. Tis the season in Scottsdale I guess. There were probably eight people working the kitchen and a few more in the seating area. This is a small, family place and it seriously seemed like everyone was there working tonight. I got home and realized I did not have a calzone I ordered so I called to let them know ( also saying hey I know you are slammed so I am not really upset). We live a couple miles from the place and they insisted on bringing the calzone to us. Again, I said, no rush as I know you are really busy. End of story, I think Lorenzo himself delivered the calzone. We will be longtime customers!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Lorenzo's on a recent trip to Scottsdale. I was pleasantly surprised at finding NY style pizza. I was raised in New Jersey so I know good pizza when I taste it."}
{"text":"Decent place for Pizza.  Wings are ok, definately frozen but edible.  Their pizza is good though and service is always friendly.  New York style and they usually have few different flavors you can get per slice."}
{"text":"sadly the pizza is good but customer service sucks.ive lived in the area for only six months and have probably spent at least $500 dollars there already.the employees are rude. this may be acceptable were there from but not in Scottsdale .we pride ourselves on being courteous and respectful to others. I ordered a pizza and they messed it up.they did not get the ingredients right and were rude and treated us like a college kid trying to get a free pizza. What upset's me is that I ordered pizza from these people all the time. we live in a million dollar home and they know who I iam. But for a $3 mistake on there part they decided to teat us like deadbeats.no loyalty. I will never eat here again. I'd rather give my money to a mom and pop shop that appreciates it."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food are the cornerstone of this italian eatery. Not in the mood for pizza, We had old standy-bys, I had spaghetti and meatballs, and she had lasagne. Both of our meals were good and served in a timely manner. Granted, it was a slow Sunday night, but they were nice and overall the food was good. Nothing extraordinary, but certainly not bad at all. Good mom and pop (Lorenzo was there) Italian fare!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has everything Italian and a good family restaurant to eat at. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went there last night, it prsented as a typical-mid class pizza joing, semi-selfserve.  Seemed out of place in N. Scottsdale.

Anyway, ordered wings, garlic twists and fries.

The garlic twists were really good (and prepared really fast), the fries (ok potatoe wedges) were awesome.

The wings were OK, we ordered Med and Hot.  The hot were hot for hot's sake, not a good flavor behind it, and too much sauce.  the Mediums were pretty good but seemed a bit greasy."}
{"text":"We were pretty underwhelmed on our first visit here.

When you arrive, you don't know if you should order at the front, sit down, or wait to be seated.

Once we sat down and ordered, it was probably a 30 minute wait before we got our pizza.

I had the Buffalo Chicken pizza, which was fine.  My fiance Anna got the Chicken and Broccoli pizza, which was also fine.  She's from NY, so she's biased, but it didn't live up to the hype, or the good reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, the sausage was the best I have had.  Service was good.  It was a busy Friday night, and we have no doubt they were working their butts off. There were 25 tickets hanging in the window at 7pm.  Our server was nice and fixed a minor issue quickly. The fried zucchini was food service prepped, but very good. I look forward to returning to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"The chef salad was really Good! Pizza was good... lacked a little flavor, but still good.  Liked the atmosphere, location, and service"}
{"text":"Our family lives close to Lorenzo's pizza. We recently tried it for the first time. OMG, what a fantastic restaurant! The food taste as though it's straight out of a Chicago pizzeria. All of the people working there are friendly and kind, and the prices cannot be beat! Thank you so much for great pizza!  Our family will certainly be frequently this establishment more and more often!  Not to mention the fact that our favorite Safeway, Ace Hardware and boutique are located in the same plaza. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Lorenzo's has New York style pizza and attitude.

 My girlfriend and I went in on our lunch break. We had to wait in line for about five minutes(not bad). When It was time to order the man behind the counter in his ever so NY \"tude\" said \"talk to me ladies\". I was a little perturbed by the comment. I get it, we are in an NY Pizza joint but there is a way to talk to your paying customers, especially women. He just seemed to be a little too \"Guido\" for my liking. 


 After we found our seat, which was a nice corner booth. I had to go up to get some silverware( which I didn't use). The man that was working the oven was the polar opposite of the\"Guido\". Super nice, helpful and did everything with a smile. He was a doll. 


We got our food FAST! Oh and it was cheap! Delicious and cheesy pizza that folded with the greatest of ease. 




I will definitely go back again. You cant beat $5 for 2 slices and drink."}
{"text":"Love the New York style pizza. Stromboli is great. Garlic knots are also very yummy. Super friendly service and nice, polite staff."}
{"text":"Ordered: Calimari, Antipasto, Spicey Buffalo Wings, and Garlic Knots.

1. Calamari (actually low grade pig rectum slices mixed with a few tentacle bits...seriously, look it up). This is D grade frozen cheap supply, sold as seafood. The only way this can be considered seafood, is if the pig was a surfer, or ate crab legs and shrimp cakes every day of its sad life, waiting to have its turd-cutter transformed into sliced overpriced greasy lies.

2. Spicey Buffalo Wings. Yes, it chicken...9 of 12 wings were freezer-burned LEGS, not wings. The chewiness, freezer burn, and overall \"wet skin\" texture of the heat lamp cooked wings was more like a zombie chew toy, than a delicious chicken wing. Yuck.

3.Antipasto...Romain lettuce, sliced CANNED black olives, Sliced Red Tomato, worst provolone I've ever tasted, D-rate salami, and, well, that was it...other than the water-slide water called \"Italian Dressing\" that came with it. Pepperoncini? Nope. Green olives? Negative. Flavor? Nooooooope!

4. Garlic Knots. These dough balls must cheap This crap-shack in operation. Delicious? Nope...but after eating a freezer burned bouquet of bad choices, I guess a near flavorless ball of dough, low grade olive oil (not even 100% olive oil), and flavorless garlic mush, formed into a blown out balloon knot, this became the highlight of our night. 

In conclusion, I'M ON VACATION, and after a long day of fun, on our last day, decided to waste $40 on straight-up garbage. I'm looking at a pile of wings, half a disabled salad, and a some pig anus rings. The Garlic Knots were superb though! If superb means lackluster bread nuggets.

Ps, we drove to get pickup, because delivery was going to be AN HOUR AND A HALF! We're a mile away! How many tastebud-less drones could possibly want to ingest this garbage at once? 
Hopefully NOT YOU!

Add me as a friend if you \"Feel\" my review! Peace and Prosperity!"}
{"text":"Can't emphasize how DIS-appointed I am to have to update my review for Lorenzo's. We've had some really good meals there, but the excellent alfredo we had the first time must have been a fluke.

Tried it again, and it was terrible...watery, broken sauce. Hubbie sent it back, and it came back exactly the same -- this time Lorenzo (the chef) came out, clearly insulted that we didn't appreciate his broken sauce (!), and insisting that alfredo is supposed to be thin...we agreed it wasn't an issue of viscosity, but rather the fact that THE SAUCE WAS BROKEN! 

He then told us that happens when you add chicken to the sauce...um, no...FYI, cream-based sauces typically break when they're overheated or an acid is introduced. We weren't surprised that the waiter didn't understand any of this, but it was pretty shocking the chef insisted on defending such an inferior dish. Pity, because the eggplant parm I had was really good!"}
{"text":"Great pizza got lunch for the entire office and was able to get individual slices with everyone's favorite toppings. Always friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"Great pizza. We got a large pepperoni and scarfed it down. I would suggest getting it fresh instead of by the slice, though. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I agree with what others have said about the greasy pizza. We used a ton on napkins to soak up the grease. The wings were excellent. Just a warning that as soon as you present your groupon,the attitude of the staff changes dramatically and you will be treated like a second class citizen. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza take out. It was ready on time and was prepared as requested. Seems a tad pricey but no complaints. Definitely would go back for more"}
{"text":"We visited Lorenzo's for the first time on what seemed to be a very slow week night.  The pizza was OK at best and the salad was disgusting, plain and simple.

The worst part of the whole experience was when we blatantly saw our waiter go outside so he could pick his nose...and then come back inside and continue to handle food...with no gloves.  As you can imagine, we left shortly thereafter and thankfully had already received our food. 

Pay a few more $'s and go to Oregano's, CPK, Barro's...anywhere besides here!  If you're looking for \"extra boogers\" on your pizza though, make sure to visit Lorenzo's!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is the best pizza I've had in the Scottsdale ! Definitely my favorite lunch place"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and have Lorenzo's a try for takeout.. Everything was amazing, and the young adults working the counter were extremely friendly and helpful. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I need to recant my last review as I wrote it before we had completed our meal. It's not that this place is bad. The food was fine. But this was a weekend afternoon, the place was pretty empty, the server said they were making fresh iced tea. No biggie. But 35 min later when I caught here eye, it was obvious she'd forgotten our drinks. We were in there 2 hours, for some pasta...and when she finally came back after we'd been finished for quite some time, she took my plate to box my leftovers. There were 2 stuffed shells left. Awhile later, she came back and said someone in the kitchen had tossed it in the garbage, so they were re-making them. When we finally got the leftovers and got home, there were 2 stuffed shells in the container. Yes, that was how many I had left over, but were it my restaurant (and hubby being a retired exec. Chef) one would have thought after multiple flubs, they'd have remade the whole order as a \"thanks for putting up with our inept service\". Nope, 2 sad stuffed shells. So while the food was good, the service was lacking. They were friendly, if you could get their attention."}
{"text":"Great for family groups with kids. Pizza was just so so.  The ingredients and sauce lacked flavor. Prefab chicken was tasteless.  Worst remark is on the crust. Even though it was thin--what is with these chop block cookie cutter crusts that are made of sandpaper ingredients. .it bubbles up along the edges and all if the toppings gravitate in the middle. I had to wrap it in a calzone like shape to get spreadification of flavor. Yeah, that's my new coined term, so don't steal it, be happy I'm giving a heads up from a pizza connoisseur's point of view."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I really like the hospitality they provide. I feel like I'm in Italy every time I walk into this place. Very cool down to earth place. I love it!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a better review because I would much rather have a local pizza than one from a chain.  However, the pizza is just not good.  I got it a few years ago and wasn't impressed and just recently decided to give it another try.  The pizza had soooo much grease on it.  If you don't mind the grease then I guess it doesn't matter, but I am one of those people who dab my pizza with napkins, and there was a lot of napkins used.  The cheese had turned orange from the amount of grease even.  Grease aside I wasn't a fan of the sauce, too much oregano, enough to where it was noticeable.  Crust and other toppings weren't anything impressive.  Sorry to say but I'd take a Domino's or Papa John's over this."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars because the hot wings were the BEST wings I've ever had. Nice and crispy and the sauce was perfect. The cheesecake was really great and I've been thinking about it ever since we ate here. The pizza wasn't so great. My dad had recommended this place to me because he loves the pizza and he agreed that this particular night it wasn't as good as it usually is. So we're definitely going back to try it again. And even if the pizza isn't as good, the wings and cheesecake are worth the trip!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I can assure you that Lorenzo's is one of the only restaurants in Arizona to make pizza that comes close to east coast pizza (which is the best pizza!). The salad and garlic knots are also delicious. I'd recommend asking for a bit more buffalo sauce on the buffalo chicken pizza, but the slice by itself was still delicious!"}
{"text":"All the food here is great if you like Italian and the service was great too. I have noticed that since July the service has improved dramatically. Since everything is made fresh there is a short wait, but worth it. My high rating is due to the fact that I love New York style Pizza and their pasta dishes are great. In the area I have gone to very expensive and fancy Italian restaurants and did not get as good food or service. I'll always make it a point to go here for great Italian food in a very comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Phoenix isn't known for pizza and this place is pretty average for the city. We had a margarita pizza and it was fine. It had large blotches of cheese which were somewhat annoying. The garlic bread was really good and service was quick (we were the only ones dining at the time)."}
{"text":"3 1/2 for the food... service, needs work.

Yeah, it's greasy, yeah it's foldable and yeah it's yummy. New York pizza is New York pizza.

So searched over and over for a menu on the web for Lorenzo's after I read some other Yelp reviews. Finally found one but just went with our favorites. A Cheese and a Hawaiian. 

Walked in at two on a Sunday, no one around (and I mean no one- no servers, no guests). Sorry to say I had to let them know pretty vocally I was there- after three minutes of hearing them joking in the back. The nice dishwasher came out to tell me he would let them know. Seriously??

Alright, so that being said... the pizza was pretty damn good. I'm a picky girl for gelato and pizza after living in Italy... but I appreciate a hot juicy and cheesy pizza!
Cheese, REAL basil and red sauce, a thin crust but a crunchy crust.

And p.s. They definitely brush some 'love' on the crust!"}
{"text":"Found Lorenzo's by chance.  Absolutely the BEST delivery pizza EVER!!   Can't wait to try the dine in service."}
{"text":"Good place nice and simple menu and a very good traditional old school pizza, nice wings done right and good size not to small same goes with the pizza good size lots of toppings they don't skimp! I was impressed for neighbor hood Italian place, also they were pretty good under half hour on peek time delivery friendly staff, I'm ordering again this weekend!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Boulders for our wedding anniversary and wanted to enjoy the beautiful room and view so we ordered pizza from Lorenzo's at the suggestion of the concierge. With that we also ordered a Caesar salad and calamari. One would think knowing they were delivering to a resort, they would bring plates, forks and napkins..... Nope. So that brings them down a star, plus the salad was not very fresh, some of the leaves were brown and the calamari was soggy. I even asked her if the calamari would keep ok being delivered and she assured it would. At least the pizza was good. We called room service at the resort and they were kind enough to bring us utensils, etc."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't base this review on taste because I have never actually eaten here. But, I have tried to order 3 times over the phone. The last time I called they stated they were too busy to take any more orders and it was only 7pm. So, I'm sorry to say I will never eat there."}
{"text":"Love Lorenzo's. The minestrone soup is awesome, I wish it were on the menu more often."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot. Pizza, wings, salads and calamari. All are yummy good!
The Pizza
New Yorkish crust but not cartoon huge slices. Their sauce is tangy but not overpowering. Their cheese isn't greasy and the toppings are always fresh. I'm a cheese pizza fan and I do like theirs.

The Wings
I always order them the same, naked, extra crispy and medium sauce on the side. I travel all over the country and I have to say Lorenzo's wings are hands down my favorite. Perfect crispness, hot (temp wise) and meaty good. 

The Salads
Their antipasto salad is another family favorite. Crispy lettuce, fresh tomatoes and fresh cut cheese and meats. I could eat it every day for sure.

Calamari
Slightly salty, crispy and perfect. Served with their marinara sauce it is again one of my favorite. 

What they lack in atmosphere they more than make up for in tastiness and price."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's is not your typical everyday arizona restaurant. For one its not a franchise and the Namesake for the place will more often then not be in the kitchen if you come in for dinner. He apparently had restaurants in Italy and New York but left them when moving his family each time. and we are lucky he did. It's small but I've never had a problem having a conversation when the place is busy. You don't go to Lorenzo's to be seen, you go to have a great meal. 

The food is amazing. Not being from a state where Italian food is done justice (I'm looking at you 40+ olive gardens) is food is made with recipes that have been passed down from generations. And with the open concepts of the kitchen from the dining area, he can be seen rolling out pizza dough, tasting sauces, or plating pastas. I've been there several times and each meal comes out looking better then the one I had before. I personally recommend the chicken franchese, I'm probably not spelling at right and I probably haven't been saying it right either when I order it but hey it's a great meal so trust me.

The service is top notch as most of the time you'll get a member of Lorenzo's family, Lorenzo himself if its not busy, or a Tony Kukoc lookalike who's been serving there for a couple years. It matters as these people have a personal stake in the business so they truly care about their customers. It's different than other places where the waiters will treat you nice to get an extra dollar and forget your face e second you walk out the door.

Take chance at this place and I bet you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Try the chicken roll, it's great! Good pizza and wings too. Delivery, although sometimes slow."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how the rest of the menu goes but the lasagna was the worst I've ever had. The little garlic knots were ok. Everyone at Lorenzo's was nice and I have nothing to say bad about the establishment as a whole. I was craving lasagna and was disappointed. The sauce tasted like it was just poured straight out of a can. It tasted more like tomato paste than a sauce. Again, nothing terrible about Lorenzo's itself, I just just disliked their lasagna."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the bad reviews.  Basically same experience as others where they made me sit and wait forever and my pizza was sitting in the warmer.  I finally had to ask about it. Rude and incompetent staff- fair pizza. Maybe the pizza would have been better if it wasn't an hour old."}
{"text":"lo adoro !!!

Perfect Italian food. The customer service is incredibly friendly and warm. It's authentic Italian food and the lasagna is to die for! The best food I've ever had! 
If I lived closer, I would definitely eat here regularly."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's gets my New York blessing, me and my wife had a regular slice each and it was deliscouso! Ordered a large pie to go now and had another slice while waiting with Pepporoni, mmmm good! The dough is made with perfection!! New York Style yes yes yes !!!"}
{"text":"We love Lorenzos! Staff is super cool and friendly. Nothing fancy about the restaurant because if you go there it's all about the FOOD! We love their meatball and ricotta cheese pizza, holy crap that pizza is good. If you go around lunch they have pizza slices ready to go so you an get a quick meal fast. Prices are on point and we will always be loyal customers to Lorenzos. Way to go guys! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place has GREAT  food if you are looking to get it and go. If you want a place to dine in, I wouldn't go here. The service is AWFUL . It takes forever to get served."}
{"text":"We went into Lorenzo's not knowing it was under new ownership. 
The food was fantastic...The service wasn't great however to be fair they were short staffed. We totally enjoyed our food. I had a Calzone, and my husband and the kids shared a 16\" pizza. Enough for everyone. We had a BLAST. The owner was so cool and they DELIVER YEAH!!! I'm so excited to have a new option for N. Scottsdale that will deliver and be SUPER YUMMY :)"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Chicken Roll, Spinach Roll and Garlic knots is what our family likes to order.   The pizza used to be hit-or-miss.  Sometimes the ingredients just didn't seem fresh.  BUT, seems they are doing it right the past few times.  You will NOT go wrong with ordering the rolls.  They are huge and delicious.  I would recommend getting extra marinara for dipping!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend that is the general manager at a luxury steakhouse. Great pizza.  You can have a slice or an entire pie.  This isn't a chain pizza joint. This is the best pizza. Scottsdale has to offer"}
{"text":"Definitely a greasy pizza but sometimes that's what you want.
They have slices at lunch. Love that, always handy.
Usually have espn on the big screen."}
{"text":"I was on business from out of town. Ordered through Yelp App. My order was slightly incorrect - they forgot to put the pepperoni on. So, a cheese and onion pizza was a bit weird, but it tasted awesome nonetheless! The cannoli was to die for. The pizza was New York style, and a bit different than I find in Wisconsin, so it was a nice change of pace. They even nicely included extra napkins, utensils, and plates that I requested. I tried a different place the next evening, and it left me wishing I had just ordered from Lorenzo's two nights in a row!"}
{"text":"We ate here recently, and the food was decent.  The pizza was good - pretty flavorful and the portions are ample.  The garlic knots are tasty and a good side order.  We also ordered the salad, which worked well for the family.  The service was attentive, although we were the only ones in the place.  Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I enjoy the pizza and garlic knots here. I haven't had anything else. The garlic knots are the best in town - made so that a toothbrush doesn't even help you! Yum!"}
{"text":"DH & I went over for dinner on Monday night...the service was terrible, and the food was not that great either. We had the garlic knots which was the best thing we ate that night. We also had baked pasta shells and eggplant parmigiana, both had way too much cheese on it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I only live a mile away and there aren't many restaurants close by. I was hoping that this would become somewhere I could go on a week night when we didn't feel like cooking. With so many 5 star reviews I was hoping it would be good to great. Unfortunately, it was just mediocre. The garlic knots were pretty good but everything went downhill after that. 

The salad was just basic, nothing special. It didn't help that we ordered it with Italian dressing and they served it with balsamic vinegar. Mistakes happen, we didn't complain. We had the ravioli and a Lorenzo's Special Calzone. The ravioli looked like a pile of sauce and cheese spreading all over a plate. You wouldn't know there were noodles there until you bit into it. There was no form to it at all. When we mentioned to the server that there was a pea in the sauce we were told that this is intentional. Peas in lasagna, who knew? The taste? Bland. The texture? Soggy, no substance at all. 

The calzone was huge but like the lasagna, lackluster. The texture and taste of the crust was very basic and, in general, not anything that stands out or would make you want more. The diet Coke was good though and you get free refills. Obviously I didn't try everything on the menu but I won't be back since my first impressions are that it's not worth a second shot."}
{"text":"If you want authentic New York City pizza you have to come to Lorenzo's! The owner is so friendly and helpful and serves up the best Italian dish in town for a great price."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here last night for the first time.  Service was good.  But the Pizza....if there is pizza in heaven, it must taste like this!!! omg."}
{"text":"This place is addicting, I eat here all the time, fast affordable and delicious! The buffalo chicken pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"Always good food and amazing service! The staff and owners always make you feel very welcome here and it's a comfortable atmosphere. We have tried many dishes and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite pizza ever!  I can no longer imagine anything better than Lorenzo's White pizza.  This super simple pie of ricotta, garlic, and mozzarella won me over at first bite, actually at first sight once I saw the size of it.  I owe a HUGE thank you to my husband that could not us.  Had he showed up, he would have insisted on your standard red sauce pepperoni pizza, although I have a sneaking suspicion Lorenzo can conjure up a pretty good pepperoni pie, too.  

Even mister red sauce had to admit the leftovers were pretty darn tasty.  And the garlic knots?  Pure doughy deliciousness.  And Shannon M, you displayed the ultimate act of friendship prior to abandoning Arizona, by hooking me up with Lorenzo.  I might need to buy your house just so I can live closer to him!"}
{"text":"Tried Lorenzo's for the first time recently and will definitely be going back. We had a large cheese pizza, garlic knots and a caesar salad and it was all amazing and very authentic. Gave you the feeling it was homemade and not just another chain restaurant. 
We liked it so much, we contemplated having it again the very next night.
Although we did take out, the service over the phone and in-person was also very pleasant and on point. Their restaurant is also a great place to take in a game on one of their flat screens while enjoying some great food."}
{"text":"Always enjoy their NY style pizzas. Had their vodka pasta tonight, too and quite tasty. Nice small restaurant in north Scottsdale. Enjoy hearing them speak Italian.  Homemade desserts, too."}
{"text":"Yummy cheap quick New York style pizza. It's not bad. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch after our morning trail ride at Macdonalds Ranch.  We were super glad they were open at 10am since we were still on Ohio time.  They have a good variety on there lunch \"ready to eat/by the slice\" bar, but we ordered a whole pie made to order and a fettuchine alfredo for one of the kids.  We also got the garlic knots for an appetizer.  All of the food was great.  Crust is thin and sauce is perfectly sweet.  You need a fork and knife to eat it without making a mess.  Staff was super nice.  Prices are reasonable.  Highly recommend.  And, they have free wifi, you just have to ask for the password."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wish I was able to eat pizza more often. Used to literally come here daily and miss it. Family owned and run perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"Such delicious food. Pizza is great but the other food is just plain delicious. I love to come for lunch and enjoy a futebol match and have just awesome Italian food. Reminds me of being on the road."}
{"text":"If you like east coast greasy, cheeses, doughy, style pizza, then this is your place. Located in a strip mall at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Road. They offer slices unlike most of the other places in town.
After selecting from one of the five or six slice options, they cook it in the oven and a few minutes later your slice is done. I dab the slice with a napkin or two to get the grease off. 
In addition to pizzas, they offer salads as well as full dinner entrees. And yes, they have the required checkerboard tablecloths."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza girl, so when DH and I and another couple went to Lorenzos, I was like: hmmm.  

DH and I started by splitting an antipasta salad.  Plenty for two, lots of meat and cheese, olives, onions, crisp, fresh lettuce but the house-made Italian dressing lacked oomph.  Needed more herbs, garlic, a touch more vinegar to give it some acidity.  

DH ordered a large pepperoni and cheese pizza for himself.  He likes leftovers for breakfast.  (Pizza for breakfast---eeeew!)  I contemplated one of the entrees---they had the Italian basics, but our friend, who is Italian AND has taught Italian cooking classes said she didn't love the sauce, so instead I decided on a \"sausage roll\".  What is a sausage roll?  Just a delectable roll up of dough around sausage and peppers and ooey-gooey melted mozzarella----it was so tasty.  It was GOOD!  And it came with a little bowl of marinara to dip in.  I don't have an iota of Italian in me, so I probably am not a good judge---I grew up on Beef-Boy-R-Dee and Ragu, but I really liked this sauce.  It was very light, not sweet, almost simple.  The sausage roll wa big enough that I brought home half for lunch the next day.  

DH and our friends both really enjoyed their pizzas (they also got a large pepperoni) and everyone had plenty to take home for leftovers.

The garlic knots were so-so.  I don't know why they weren't as good as Troni's---they just weren't.

Service was pretty good---I mean, it's a pizzeria.   Friendly---a little confused, but they kept our drinks and waters topped and checked in every few to see if we needed anything else.  I thought the place was pretty clean--we sat at a booth next to a window and after a glance at the window sill between the bench seat and the glass, I kept my purse firmly on the seat beside me---ick!---but the seats themselves and the tabletops and the laminated menus were all clean.  DH said it was a totally different vibe from lunch-time, which is his normal pizza-time.  

So I enjoyed it and I told DH that next time he has a pizza crave, if he does to Lorenzos he can bring me back one of those sausage rolls for my dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, staff is always pleasant! Garlic knots are soaked in oil and garlic! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This little place in North Scottsdale beats out any other Italian restaurant. Every dish is made to order , comes out hot and is delicious! The service is wonderful. Would recommend this place without hesitation. We have eaten in many restaurants and none compare. Desserts are beyond fabulous!"}
{"text":"Terrible, inedible pizza. We ordered delivery on a Friday night, and our pizza arrived within the expected time frame. We each ate one slice of our large buffalo style pizza and threw the rest away.  The crust was like cardboard and if there was any cheese on the pizza at all, you needed a microscope to see it. Truly disgusting pizza."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's is an average pizza joint. Nothing special, but not bad. I had tried Lorenzo's once before a few years ago and was happier with my meal, but this time was so-so.
Came here kind of in a rush on a Friday night, and there were plenty of open tables which was nice, not too busy. I quickly scanned the menu, none of the specialty pizzas came in a personal size so I decided on eggplant Parmesan because it is one of my favorite meals! A few years ago when I had tried this place I had ordered the veggie calzone and I think j liked that better. Was less expensive too. That's one good thing about Lorenzo's, not real expensive. I had a salad instead of pasta as my side which was a mistake because that was a very sad house salad. Plus covered in black olives, which I don't enjoy. I was happy to see we also got garlic knots on the side! Our server forgot to give them to us, but she brought them out right away when we asked about it. She was nice, a good server. 
The eggplant was drab. Like if I'm going to eat something unhealthy I want it to be delicious and this wasn't the best. I did like the sauce and cheese, but the eggplant wasn't great. Just sliced too thinly and was too soggy. The garlic knots were too garlicky and were cold in the middle, but had a good flavor overall. Lorenzo's wouldn't be my first choice, but it's ok if you're hungry for quick fairly inexpensive Italian food."}
{"text":"Called for delivery and waited an hour and twenty minutes before calling back.  They had our address wrong and never called us.  When I told them that we needed our food, Mario said \"no, you are not getting it now.\"  HE REFUSED TO BRING OUR FOOD because we were upset about them mixing up the address.  My husband called back, and Mario said we could have the food if we were willing to wait another hour.  Terrible service!  Rude Manager!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer.... I am not a traditional New York style pizza fan. 

With that said this pizza was \"traditional style NY pizza\" 

The joint was a little busy but not slammed, the service was decent but not great. The pizza was good but not the excellent. The price and portion size was right on. 

I had a pep and a sausage. The slices are about the size of 8x11 sheet of paper tapered in at the bottom. Dripping with grease. 

The crust is a thin crust, obviously, but seemed to lack any flavor. The pizza folded well and held the topping and grease as it should. The thicker end was decent, just a little too crispy for me. 

They do have a ton of options. Salads, pastas, cal zones, sandwiches, etc. I will be back but maybe for pasta instead."}
{"text":"Being Native New Yorker, Lorenzo's is a taste of home. 
The sauce is outstanding.   Everyone is so welcoming. 
Lorenzo's is a must everytime I come out to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. The staff is very accommodating and you instantly feel like home. Almost everything I've had was good. I love their buffalo, and margarita pizza."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Lorenzo's for years... It's my parents' go-to pizza place as it's close to their home.  While I've had take-out from there before, I finally had the chance to check it out first-hand to dine-in. 
 I see why they love it, but I do think the 3.5 star rating on Yelp is pretty spot-on.

I'm being generous with 4 stars because it's the holiday season and the food was actually pretty good. 

I dined with my parents, my brother, and my kids... 
We scored a large corner booth which was perfect.  It took a very long time for anyone to acknowledge us, bring menus, water, etc... so finally I asked if we were supposed to order at the counter.  I know a few other reviewers mentioned this, and it is confusing.  After we asked, our server came to say hi and take a drink order.

Our party shared a large antipasto salad, which I remembered to take a picture of and it was very good.  We waited awhile for the rest of the food to arrive and dug right in when it finally arrived, so apologies for no other pics!  We also had a large pizza, an eggplant parm (which I split with my mom), a kids spaghetti with marinara (for my daughter), and a plain cheese pizza slice (for my son).  We had to send some garlic knots back because they arrived cold, but other than that, everything was good.

I would totally return, especially when in the area visiting my folks... or order takeout as well.  Thanks Lorenzo!"}
{"text":"When we picked this restaurant for lunch, I was expecting a more upscale European style restaurant. It's a cute little casual dining restaurant, but the pizza at lunch looked like it had been sitting for quite some time. The pizza was decent after they warmed it up in the oven, but I'd advise ordering a fresh baked one if you have the time. Probably a better for take out than dine in."}
{"text":"Food was very good but service not so much. It was very busy, and after they brought us the wrong check twice, the 3rd time it was right and the waiter told us 3 people called out sick. 
We will try again but hopefully next time will get better service  30 minutes to pay your bill is not good"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Ordered for delivery. Took over an hour for delivery on a sat night. Got chicken Parmesan and a calzone. The garlic knots are really good.  Maybe we'll try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"This pizza requires patience, as they have earned a great demand due to the excellent quality of their cuisine. Case in point: just waited 2.5 minutes on hold just to place my order and quoted one hour delivery time. Both \"inconveniences\" are justified by how yummy their pizzas are. 

Warning: the less than stellar reviews do not do this place justice. I can only attest to the pizza and garlic knots. It's a delicious and solid pizza!  

We have dined at Lorenzo's on numerous occasions. It's an old fashioned pizza joint with a big pizza oven and not the fast food style pizza cooked with a conveyor belt. Seeing how many take out and delivery orders they handle is extra validation to how many of my neighbors love their food. 

Lorenzo's is conveniently located in the shopping center on the Northeast corner of N. Scottsdale Road and E. Pinnacle Peak Road. The shopping center had plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"What a happy accident...

So work has me trapped in NoPhoSco (hah) most days. I'm in the land of strip mall chain eateries near Desert Ridge. My hopes for a good pizza joint were at low ebb. But then on a trip to Ace Hardware, I discovered Lorenzo's. 

This is real NY pizza. Perfect thin crust, with a great simple sauce and light cheese. Great balance on the flavor. Not beat to death with oregano or sugar. Had reheated slices of cheese and sausage that were really good.

And they deliver to our store location, so gonna try a whole made-to-order pie soon. Yay :-)"}
{"text":"Always great food and service. I have ordered out and also eaten there. Staff is always super friends. One of the best pizzas around !!"}

The Garlic Knots are awesome and addicting....very Garlicky, so be careful to plan ahead and not eat these before anything *special*...LOL

The Pizza is very good.  We order it \"well done\", but with it being so loaded, it's not as crispy as I'd like....but that's ok, we knew it would be tough with all of those toppings.  The toppings are fresh and tasty and the Dough is yummy!

Service here is good, we've had a couple of great servers.

Return Factor - 88%"}
{"text":"Come here often for lunch since its next to my work and i usually get a slice of cheese and a slice of peperoni pizza to go. Love the pizza. Its greasy but a few dabs with a napkin and don't forget the ranch and its a good pizza. The garlic knots are yummy!! Had the chicken Parmesan once and wasn't a big fan. I didn't like the sauce and i rather go to Olive garden/maggianos or Nicks for chicken parm. But sill love coming here for the pizza. When ordering a large pizza it tastes even better since it wasn't sitting out during lunch time. The crust is the best part and the price is great for lunch"}
{"text":"Went to Lorenzo's on a Groupon.  We choose to sit in a booth.  The booth was filthy and later cleaned by the server.  Shouldn't they have done that before we sat down??  My husband is from NY so he is super picky about pizza.  Ordered a regular cheese pizza and Caesar salad.  The salad comes with garlic knots which I wanted to try.  The salad was not crisp, rather it was soggy.  The garlic knots were somewhat greasy.  The pizza was disappointing and lukewarm.  Hard crust and way too salty.  Usually, my hubby can eat several pieces of pizza and this time he only ate two.   Sorry Lorenzo's, we won't be back and thankfully the Groupon paid for everything except the tip.  We took home leftovers and I warmed up a piece.  On a good note, it tasted better when it was bubbling hot."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful awful. Do NOT patronize this establishment.  Delivery time quoted of 70 minutes was LESS THAN HALF of what actually happened.   The management demonstrated ZERO interest or concern for their error and poor customer service.  Let them go out of business and hopefully a pizzeria with management that gives a darn will take over the space."}
{"text":"Sometimes all you need is a little help to see what has been in front of you all along.  Lorenzo's is so very close to where I live, but I was just introduced to it this weekend.  Thank You!!  :)

My friend suggested we order some fantastic take-out to enjoy while watching the playoff games.  A quick call and we were zooming down Pinnacle Peak towards some of the tastiest Italian food I have had in a while.  

Two words... Garlic Knots.  Beautiful little twists of dough that have been marinated in an aromatic blend of chopped garlic and olive oil... heated and served with a tangy marinara sauce.  After getting them home they never even made it onto our plates - we attacked them right in the container!  It is too bad that my mom raised me to have good manners, since I grudgingly gave my guest the last one.  Seriously, the order could have been twice as big and we could have polished it off without a problem.

Next... Antipasto salad.  A generous serving of all kinds of good things including fresh mozzarella, salami, provolone... delish!

The Main Event... a killer ham & cheese calzone.  This thing could have doubled as the football on the TV.  Huge!  Beautiful!  Stuffed full of ham, mozzarella and ricotta.  Topped with the marinara sauce it was truly a sight to behold.  Yesssssss!

My car still smells like garlic.  I really like that!"}
{"text":"This is as close to New York/East Coast style pizza as you're going to get in North Scottsdale. The menu is old-school Italian American, and it's  probably as good as the food you used to have \"back home\" (because your memory is flawed)."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza west of the Mississippi.   I love the pasta dishes as well. This is an affordable and delicious!  This is as good as what I can get in Roma."}
{"text":"Today I called in an order for my kids. I waited 5 minutes on hold before they took my order. When I went to pick it up, I gave the middle aged, large man my groupon. He said I could not use it on the order. My groupon does not say not mention that it could not be used for a take out order. I said really? Yes, was the rely. I said I'll eat the pizza here then. He said no! I said, ok then I won't buy it. He said ok, with the absolute worst attitude ever.  Now, this is not the first bad experience I've encountered here but I truly try to overlook people's attitudes. Therefore, I can't recommend this place because I like to be treated with kindness and respect. The proper response from this business should have been: I'm sorry Miss but your Groupon cannot be used on take out orders, I'll let you use it today but please know it is not our policy."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend with an expired groupon I never got around to. With groupon, the amount paid , \" never expires!\" So I am still able to use the amount  I paid for.  So. The guy at the counter, did not want to honor my groupon. He refused to accept it, he said he did not know if he can accept it because it was expired. So I ask him if he can get a manager up here to make that call since he didn't know what to do. He said , we don't have a manager here. To make the long store short, the manager / owner is on vacation and will be back in two weeks. He wanted me to come back in two weeks to talk to him. Stupid right!! This guys lacks really bad in customer service and should be up in front greeting the customers. But then again, there is no supervisor / manager on duty, there on vacation!! How does this place run and who's in charge while the supervisor /manager / owner is on vacation.? This business reached out to Groupon to advertise there business, a customer comes in with a groupon to try out there food and was denied. Wow! Bad customer service!!"}
{"text":"Lorenzo's is awesome. Pizza is always great. Go there at least twice a week. Very laid back."}
{"text":"It's very good.   The buffalo chicken pizza is excellent.  Really friendly staff who enjoy talking to customers."}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop joint. All of the food is always excellent, but once I discovered the bolognese sauce with Ziti, I have been in a major rut!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, Sicilian owned and ran. Everything from the Caesar dressing to the marinara and calamari delicious! Can't say enough about Lorenzos. My only complaints would be that it is far out there and one server on made service somewhat lag."}
{"text":"Normally a good choice.  We have ordered a number of times and have really enjoyed the food and service.  The past few times, however, something must have changed.  It took over an 1 hour and 45 minutes for our delivery tonight and close to an 1 hour and 30 minutes the last two times.  Not even an apology when delivered.  I have to say the pizza is good, when warm, but if you have it delivered, order early and turn the oven on so that you can heat it up."}
{"text":"Great restaurant experience. I love everything they make, super friendly staff, family run. Everything tastes fantastic, the best is the homemade cheese cake and their meat lovers Calzone."}
{"text":"Probably the most awful chicken parm sandwich available in any \"Italian\" place, east coast, west coast, and anywhere in between. Think gnarly, frozen breaded chicken cutlets that were heated in a microwave. Meatball sandwich equally horrible. Aside from how terrible the actual meatballs are, the breakdown of sub components are approximately 50% roll, 30% cheese, 20% meatball, which could be a good thing, depending on how you look at it. The fries were the best, because they're obviously frozen from some major food purveyor, but even they weren't cooked properly."}
{"text":"We had Lorenzo's for the first time last night.  We're in from out of town and I figured Yelp would be a good resource for finding a local pizza place.  Overall the Pizza was OK.  

The vegetarian pizza was not very good.  It had so many veggies that the pizza got soggy and  you had to eat it with a spoon.  (1 1/2 stars)

The Lorenzo's special was better. A little more authentic. (3 1/2 stars)

I do have to recommend that you not get it delivered.  I called in and was told it would be 1hr- 1:15 ... understandable for a Sunday evening.  After for an hour and a half I had to call and see what was up... I was told it was on it's way.  Finally, it showed up two hours after ordering.  The driver apologized, but I would have expected the manager to have at least taken a few bucks off the bill.  I also got the wrong change back from the driver when I told him to give himself a $7 tip... could have been an honest mistake
 
So, 50 bucks later with my soggy veggie pizza I felt I had to post on Yelp."}
{"text":"Pizza lovers will adore this family pizza shop.  Dine in or carry home, the pizza is amazing, the cheesecake is fabulous too!  I love the checkered tablecloths and the low key vibe to go with such a delicious pizza experience.  Best of all, it's a great value!  Don't miss out on this great North Scottsdale Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Had Lorenzo's cater the Eagles Super Bowl. They hooked it up with a large pizza, wings, garlic knots and a 3' party sub. It was all delivered fresh and on time. Delicious meal for an epic super bowl. If you've had Lorenzo's then you know what I'm talking about and if you haven't then you gotta get on it. Best Italian food in town!"}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service!! I've eaten here a few times and the food is decent, especially since there are no good pizza places in N. Scottsdale, N. of the 101,  (which is the only reason I've come back because the service has always been terrible if you actually sit and eat in the restaurant) but beware if you do use a Groupon. We ran into some neighbors a few weeks ago on the last day you could use an expiring Groupon  and after the kids started playing together, we ended up pushing our tables together (this was super early around 530pm so there was room to sit near us). We came in separately, ordered 20 minutes apart, got our food 30 minutes apart and then when it came time to pay our bill, they rang us up together (we didn't ask them to) and were going to refuse to use one of our Groupons. After I said I wouldn't pay full price, the young 20-something manager threatened to call the police on me. I told him to go ahead and I was serious. Meanwhile, they had a wait because apparently, they weren't letting anyone else with a Groupon who knew each other even sit near each other. They ended up accepting both Groupons and then I proceeded to tell them I would never come back. Just horrible customer service and no clue how to treat a returning customer. I actually notified Groupon about my experience because I had purchased an additional Groupon that expires at the end of the year and told them I would never step foot in there again and wanted a refund. Thankfully, they quickly obliged."}
{"text":"We took out a sicilian pie, pizza slices and garlic knots and it felt just like home, Queens."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there on a Friday night and had a great dinner.  It was crowded and we had to wait, but the guy who runs the place was very apologetic for the wait and even gave us some garlic knots when we sat down.  It was unnecessary, but a very nice gestrue.  
We had the eggplant pizza and a salad.  Both were excellent.  My boyfrend and I are both Italian and both from the east coast so we know what pizza should taste like.  Excellent all around.  Can't wait to go back and try something else.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Everything made from scratch, family-owned and operated, reasonably priced (including the wines), extensive menu. John our waiter was great and steered us in the right direction throughout our entire meal. It's refreshing to find a treasure like this in far north Scottsdale that doesn't try to rip you off for quality. We had veal parm and a spicy chicken dish that were both yummy. A shared salad was fresh and full of toppings. And the chef had just made AMAZING rice balls! My only regret was that I was too full to try a cannoli for dessert. LOVE this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for early dinner.  Asked if veal was tender.  Was told it was a very popular item.  One waitress, horrible service, dirty tables,  no A/C.  84 degrees outside, felt like 94 degrees inside.  Asked her to turn on A/C and she said she'd have to check with the boss.

Boyfriend ordered pizza, I ordered veal marsala.  Pizza was delivered and finished by boyfriend before I even got served.

Veal was like rubber.  Served over noodles.  Could not taste any marsala wine.

Left disgusted.  It was cooler outside than inside.  Thank goodness I had a Groupon coupon and didn't have to pay full price.

Don't bother going here.  Wait for Tomasso's to open next door."}
{"text":"The food is good (especially the crispy salads and garlic knots) and the portion sizes are large.. However, the service on a Sunday afternoon (2:30) was poor. There was no wait staff to take orders at the tables. The large guy behind the counter was rude.There was 6 of us and overall the food was good and authentic(NY). The only regret was that I ordered the eggplant parmigiana.It was soggy."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ordered pizza here. Simply put, it was awful! It took 1 1/2 hours to arrive, it was cold, dry, the black olives & mushrooms looked & tasted artificial.  I will never order from them again and for pizza in the Grayhawk area, Barro's is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"Wow a little taste of NY and Italy in Scottsdale.  Delicious pizza and desserts. If you're looking for good Italian food cooked by real Italians this is the place."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's has a great lunch slice special. go there at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Great crust and pizza. A little pricey $20 for a 14 inch pepperoni but its the only quality pizza place that delivers."}
{"text":"Place is pretty busy which is more of a testament to the typical Phoenician not knowing what decent pizza is. As you enter you are left with the choice of seating yourself or standing in the middle of the restaurant like a moron. Take a seat at one of the many unbussed dirty tables and get ready for the 5-10 minute wait before you are greeted by the ONE waiter for the whole place. 

The pizza is just not good. I'm not sure who they have making the pizza but he should be fired. The pizza was soggy and watery. I'm not sure if this was because of the canned mushrooms(lol really) or poor quality cheese. I have encountered oily pizza before but watery pizza is a first.

The chicken parm hero was edible that's best thing that can be said about it. The calamari was rubbery and of poor quality. If you are going to use frozen pre-made calamari you should at least buy the higher quality."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went there yesterday evening with my boyfriend (who is a bit of a food snob). The food was great and the service was outstanding. We will definately be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite place to eat.  We are total regulars here, as my husband, who grew up in New Jersey, is a total snob for New York style pizza and Lorenzo's knows how to do it right!  Pasta here is also excellent - I have a special fondness for the carbonara!  And my husband also swears by the Chicken Parmesan sandwiches.  MMM MMM!  I think I'll go there right now!  :0)"}
{"text":"Best garlic knots in town!  I love everything about this place: food, service and I have even used them to cater parties!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and some friends and we really liked it. I can't eat gluten so I just got the salad, but everyone else seemed to love their meals. For an appetizer they got garlic knots which were to die for. My 2 kids and my husband shared the gran-ma pizza which was with marinara, fresh mozzarella, and basil. I tried a little piece and it tasted just like the pizza in NY. I'm from NY so I know my NY pizza. Overall this was a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Lorenzo's because i found a Restaurant.com coupon. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal!  The Greek salad was crisp with a yummy dressing, and was served with fresh-baked, garlicky twist rolls.  Our Chicken Parmesan was cooked just right, and included pasta with a delicious marinara sauce.  Portions were very generous.

We chatted with the owner Lorenzo and he is a very engaging fellow who obviously takes his recipes, and his customer satisfaction, seriously.  We'll be back soon with family!  We are happy that another great family-style pizza restaurant is convenient to denizens of the Pinnacle Peak area.  Coupon or not, try Lorenzo's and mention that Robert sent you - I'm hoping he'll reward me with one of his delish cannoli's!"}
{"text":"good New York style pizza lunch special.  just over 5 bucks for 2 slices and a drink.  Also a good place to watch world cup on a lunch break. ( even though I don't know what is going on)"}
{"text":"This place has some of my favorite pizza ever. The crust is just amazing, the sauce is not too heavy, not too light, and the cheese is melted goodness. Today I had the spaghetti and meatballs and for around $9 it came with a side salad that wasn't like a side salad at all with iceberg lettuce. Instead I was served mixed greens, a few chunks of cucumber and tomato and black olive slices as well. You have a choice of Italian dressing, Balsamic, and one other I can't think of right now. But I am a huge Balsamic vinegar fan so I went with it and I'm glad I did. PERFECTION.

Great service, and nice inside area to sit down and have a nice meal. You do have to go up to the counter to order, but your food is brought out to your table. Hey, it beats paying an extra $5 or so for a tip! But the service and food here is so amazing, sometimes we feel like we should even without waiter service."}
{"text":"This place had fantastic slices and really liked the garlic knots too. We saw pastas and a Philly Cheese Steak that came out that looked so good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was starving after working way past lunch and I stopped for a hero sandwich at Lorenzo's.  I was helped by a man who I felt I was interrupting his day to get a sandwich.  I asked for dbl meat on the hero sandwich and when I got home there was one layer of meat after being charged $11.33 which included dbl meat. Either they missed it or they just put small portions on their sandwiches.  I bad part was my sandwich was sitting on the counter from the person who made it for 5 minutes before he bagged it.  Why couldn't of the guy just called my name.  So much for topping $2 ahead to get it quick.  The sandwich was good but lack of service and no dbl meat made me write this.  I do like their pizza."}
{"text":"Our now favorite Italian restaurant now that New York's Best Italian Bistro closed. Everything that I've tried here has been authentic and tasty. The cheese cake is to die for!

This restaurant is just the right size to afford quick service and open tables.

You will usually see Mama sitting in a booth by the window. Say \"Hi\"."}
{"text":"I popped in for take out on a Wednesday. 4:30 pm'ish. Chance helped me. He was marvelous. I ordered eggplant parm and penne pesto with a side of garlic knots. Chance advised that garlic knots come with my entrees. So I added the spinach calzone. All the food was amazing.  The portions are generous. The flavor was authentic and amazing. The service met and exceeded expectations. I had a beer while I waited. What a delightful outdoor seating area to enjoy a ten minute time out. I can't wait to return, if even to just sit there and enjoy a Peroni."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very authentic NY style pizza.  They're always very nice and fast.  Delicious calzones.  Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"We had to wait 2 hours for our delivery! Pizza was soggy and barely warm and Caesar salads we limp and watery! Obviously we did not have a good experience and no compensations were offered. We will never call them again."}
{"text":"meh. Pizza is mostly bland, very cardboard taste. Delivery times takes almost two hours. My order has been wrong all three times I have used them. Staff on the phone are always distracted when I call and unprofessional, maybe the reason why my order is always wrong. When I brought up that my order was wrong with the manager once, she put a credit on file for me. When I went to redeem the credit, it turns out it was credit for ONE ingredient only. Boy, thanks. I mean, the pizza you got wrong was unedible because of a food allergy and was $22.00, but thanks for giving me credit for $1.85 towards my next purchase (where you forgot to include an additional order of garlic knots.) *sigh* Wings aren't great either by the way. I was excited to move to an area where I would have a local pizza joint down the road but Lorenzos has horribly disappointed and underwhelmed me. Will not be getting any more of my business, sorry."}
{"text":"I have stopped here a few times now for their two slice and a soda for 5.00 special. It is very satisfying, I stick with a simple cheese and a side of hot hot hot wing sauce to spice up my shavings. Let me say however that many people like their buffalo chicken pizza which I'm sure is fantastic judging by overall consensus. I would recommend Lorenzo's to anyone looking for an affordable slice of satisfaction."}
{"text":"Let me starting by saying that I wasn't expecting a mind blowing experience but I was expecting decent. We have limited delivery in our area and we wanted to try something different than your typical fast food chain delivery. Our experience was terrible. We live about ten minutes away and it took over an hour and 15 min get get our order. The caesar salad arrived with dressing on it that was like 3 times the amount of dressing anyone would want on their salad! Who delivers a salad with dressing on it? The pizza was vile. It tasted like soggy cardboard. There was no flavor what so ever and the basil on the too was charred and you couldn't even tell it was suppose to be green. Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Hole in the wall pizza joint, nothing fancy about it EXCEPT their freaking amazing pizza. They have it all! The best pizza that we get there is their ricotta and meatball pizza, it's a must try! Generous with their toppings. Also, another favorite is the Buffalo chicken, it's like a chicken wing pizza, sounds weird but it works! So good.

We're remodeling a home near-by so I always pick up cheese/pepperoni pizza for the guys. Feeds a lot of people!

If you're in the area and need a good pizza, check out Lorenzo's Pizza and Pasta, you're going to love it."}
{"text":"I've been ordering Lorenzo's food since they opened.  While I haven't tasted the entire menu, what I have eaten has been very good.  The pizza is delicious, as well as the garlic knots.  On any given night you will see the many slips hanging for the deliveries.  They wouldn't be so busy if they had crappy food.  

The family is friendly and they all work very hard to provide their customers with great food and service.  It's a local small business that should always be supported.  

The only reason that I didn't give five stars is because I found the pasta with alfredo sauce to be bland.  This is, however, subjective.  You may like it."}
{"text":"OMG - do we love this place!!!!

We went in originally with a Groupon, and have continued to return.  

My husband and I share a Mediterranean Salad, and a basket of bread knots.  Then we each get a calzone, that are out of this world!!!  I get an all-veggie one, he gets an all-meat one.  They usually are so large, that we can eat only half, and bring the rest home.  Occasionally, we just go for it, and eat the entire calzone, in one sitting!  

I get a beer, which is always cold, and my husband gets an iced-tea.
This place is so worth the drive - they use the best cheese in our calzones, nice and fresh, mozzarella, and my veggie one is loaded with lots of vegetables!

This is probably the best calzone that I have ever had.  One of these days, we'll try a pizza, or pasta - but right now, we like our salad and our calzones!  :)"}
{"text":"There wasn't anyone really working behind the counter or in the dining room. You 're just on your own. Tables not cleaned and very dirty. The pizza when we finally got it was burned on the bottom and just very average. We will not return."}
{"text":"We ordered the Caesar salad, garlic knots, mozzarella cheese sticks, fettuccini Alfredo, fried zucchini and cheese pizza. It was aaaaamazing! Seriously the best!
Homemade ranch and pizza sauce...these New Yorkers are the real deal!!
Oh and we had the homemade cheesecake and tiramisu...we were full and happy. Service was great! Watch out! We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm really more a fan of Chicago style stuffed pizza, but Lorenzo's is the bomb. 

We always carryout and typically it's pizza and wings. After frequenting another place closer to our home several times we tried Lorenzo's and it's our new carryout spot. 

Living in Desert Ridge there aren't many good dining options other than Brooklyn's Best bagels which is fantastic by the way. So making the 6 mile trip to Lorenzo's is well worth it."}
{"text":"Generally don't go for takeout, but we were all in a pizza mood.  Decided to get takeout from Lorenzo's and it was sinfully good.  Ordered the everything pizza and the garlic knots.  
The pizza was pretty good; huge slices, lots of yummy toppings and a bit over-greasy.  
The garlic knots were little gems of carb-y goodness.  Dipped in ranch, or marinara, or even plain, I couldn't get enough.  Split between 4 people, one order went too quick!"}
{"text":"Lorenzo's is great Italian food at a great price and I think salad is included with every entree. Tony is always our waiter and he always remembers what myself and everyone from my family eats and drinks. I highly recommend the penne pesto with chicken."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious and a slice or two for lunch is so affordable. You must try the buffalo chicken pizza! Unfortunately, the last time I was in there, there was some inner-company tension going on with an argument in front of paying customers. It was definitely uncomfortable so i hope they can work on customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious Sicilian pizza! I'm Argentinian and I love my pizza thick, I tried other pizzas in the States but since moving to Phoenix Lorenzo's was the best pizza I ever tried. Everything is delicious, the place is very nice and cozy and the people super friendly"}
{"text":"Worst delivery of my life. Pizza must've slid around in delivery vehicle because the pizza is half a pile of cheese and half just burnt Crust attached you can see the photos of the pizza I received. pizza is demolished and the bottom is clearly burnt. Paid a lot of money for nothing. Garlic knots were dry too. Dining in here is good. Delivery sucks."}
{"text":"Good pizza close by at a reasonable price. Lorenzo himself delivered our order and was very customer focused.
Recommend to anyone who likes good pizza!"}
{"text":"Good place to stop by to grab a quick bite to eat...and it's not a wallet breaker either..depending what you get.

I love to sit outside on their patio. I usually always get the same thing - and that is a slice of pizza, a garden salad with balsamic vinaigrette and a soda...all that for $ 6.50.

The pizza is hit and miss though..If Mondi is not there, forget it. If he is there, the crust is awesome and when coupled with cheese...double awesomeness..

The owner is super friendly, but the interior is often super dirty which is why I don't visit all that often and generally sit outside. The guy from Albania who generally works the cashier is super nice while some others have a downright crappy attitude."}
{"text":"Great experience at Lorenzo's this evening... Service was exceptional with very friendly servers , and Lorenzo visits everyone to make you feel welcome .
Their meatballs are the best ever and their  cheesecake is , too.. Both of our meals : Linguine and meatballs and my husband had chicken parmesan were wonderful !

Two very happy customers.

{"text":"Ordered food an hour and 45 minutes ago for delivery, and they don't show up. Call to see what the problem is and they so oh, there was a problem with your food, we are going to remake it. When I ask why they didn't call, they say they were going to. I say forget it, and they don't even care. They may claim that local, family owned makes a difference. I used to think it did, but service is equally important. Unfortunately, Lorenzo hasn't learned that lesson yet and now I have to go get McDonalds for a 2 year old that is two hours late on her dinner."}
{"text":"When you order your pizza in the restaurant, you get an order of charcoal scraped from the oven with your slices. Not the best pizza, not very friendly service. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I've lived nearby for nearly ten years and just visited Lorenzo's for the first time a few weeks ago.  The food is really good and the family is super nice and very honest.  The owner overcooked my calzone, showed it to me, apologized and made another one.  That interaction and attention to detail alone will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"The reason for low score goes to the time it took to get a meatball parm at lunchtime. This should have been a 10 minute event, now 20 min later still no food!

The sandwich is good, the bread light and crispy. All in all good food, just slow."}
{"text":"So my little boys and I found this gem of a place on yelp! The first time we ordered we got it delivered and the delivery guy was SOOOO NICE! He was very personable! The 2nd time we did take Out bc we were so close by and the gal who rang us up was sweet and seemed appreciative of us ordering from them. The place isn't huge but it's exactly what a mom & Pop Italian Place should be!! They have a patio too so next time we may dine in! Ok, third visit - take out again! This time during the day. The kitchen staff and the young man who rang me up were very friendly and said, \"thank you\" to us at least 5 times!! All 3 of my interactions made me feel like they valued my business. Very cool!! 
The pizza????? Omg. Soooooooo good!!!!!!!! We got the Sicilian style all 3 times!!! I also got the Caprese salad twice and it's on point. 
It's yummy!! The portions were really good- not skimpy!!! It's casual and I love it."}
{"text":"Just ate at lorenzos. Chicken picatta and garlic knots are off da hook. Closest ny Italian u can get in north phoenix.  Love this place"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA! And nice staff! I had called barros to deliver a pizza and asked that the pepperonis be in a smiley face for the recipient. They said that they were too busy to do something like that so I called here. They said no problem! They're pizzas and slices alone and big!"}
{"text":"Solid quickie lunch spot. Cracker thin crust with fresh ingredients. More specialty pie selection than other similar opts. Can't beat the value!"}
{"text":"A strong 4 stars for the pizza (if you order a fresh new pie, as the slices for lunch specials looked like had been sitting 30-45 minutes).  Anyway, the pizza I ordered was excellent.  This place though loses a star for the customer service as well as the environment.  Nobody comes up front, they have 1 cheese shaker for like 30 tables, there is food and crumbs on a lot of the tables in a mostly empty restaurant (only 2 tables used for customers), the employees seemed to hang out in back most of the time rather than have anyone at all at the counter, and a few of the table clothes were ripped.  Kind of a sloppy environment.

The pizza though, was excellent.  I would get take-out from them for sure, but eating in the actual restaurant left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Menu has many different options, food is good, decent portion sizes for the pasta dishes. Service was great, very attentive staff. The cannoli and espresso for desert were a great way to finish a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Lorenzo's has much improved!  I have ordered delivery from them again multiple times simply because there is NOWHERE else in the area to get pizza delivery from that isn't a cheap pizza chain, and we wanted some better quality pizza for workers that were doing construction, handyman, stereo, television, etc work on our new home we moved into in November.

They have delivered much faster, and in fact once I was told they actually put my order in front of someone who called sooner because it was a larger order and would have unnecessarily delayed mine.  Great job Lorenzos!

Also, we tried dining in as a family 2 or 3 times.  One of the times there was a Gila monster right outside the door which was exiting.  Service was great.  They were very accommodating with our baby.

We are taking out of town company there tonight.

Didn't give 5 full stars because they are still rude when they answer the phone sometimes - especially one girl in particular that has an attitude, but that's the only think left that I think they really could work on to improve service.  :-)"}
{"text":"Wings are great, pizza is always fresh.  I go hear once a week."}
{"text":"Here's the story; originally from New Jersey I was beginning to think Arizona ..... great Pizza CAN'T be found .....Well I was WRONG. Holy Toledo,  LORENZO'S is the answer . The pizza here is the best I have ever had BARRING NONE. Even New Jersey can take lessons from Lorenzo's . Awesome awesome awesome pizza! Looks as if they serve interesting delicious food here also. DONOT WALK RUN TO THIS PLACE. You my friend won't be one bit disappointed. I am so addicted . I would give it 100 stars if I could. No joke."}
{"text":"The \"full service\" experience at dinner time is lacking.  It's as if they aren't real servers and just want customers tipping on top of the food prices.  No drink refills.  No follow ups to see if everything was OK. Everything slow.  The real kicker was when they accidentally boxed up my pizza to go when it was a dine-in order, and we waited... Waited... Waited and they couldn't understand why people after me were getting their pizzas first."}
