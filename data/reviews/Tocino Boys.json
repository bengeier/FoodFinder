{"text":"This place is amazing! Didn't expect much waking by it, but once I went in and spoke to the owner and ordered some tacos I was blown away! Fresh ingredients, crisp, tasty mean tacos! And only 2.50$ wow this place is perfect! I would so recommend any one to go oh and did I mention 10$ pitchers? This is a must if ur in the area and they have other items too! The super super sandwich which my friend got was on point as well and at 5$ u can't go wrong !!"}
{"text":"Wow, has John here at Tocino Boys ever gotten it down right! I remember when he first opened up and I stopped by to try it out and thought it was good but it never had the wow factor for me. It was good, but not amazing.  But now, holy schnikes, he`s perfected it. I went by the other night and got a Supreme Supreme. It was an absolutely salivatingly delicious sandwich. My buddy ordered the chorizo poutine which was also really good but after finishing the supreme supreme, i just had to go order another one, I wasn`t done treating my taste buds to this delectable treat.  Added bonus, it goes down perfectly with beer! Compliments it so well. Can`t wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"This is Filipino street food with a modern and classic twist.  I would never have imagined that tocino can be made this way because growing up, tocino, or sweet pork sausages, are basically fried and eaten with rice and eggs for breakfast. The idea to make tocino more modern and western is pretty cool. I really like the tocino pork bun. Simple, tasty and classic. The bun, in Tagalog, is called \"pandesal\". This is a sweet soft bun and it's best eaten in the morning...freshly baked and paired with coffee. Mixing these two filipino breakfast essentials is genius and I love the \"secret sauce\" that came with it!   I have also tries their chorizo tacos...and I must say, the veggies are fresh and the sauce is refreshing.   They also have the cheddar cheese ice cream. If you're not Filipino, you probably think this combination is a little strange...but growing up in a Filipino household, kids love this ice cream! Some people even have it with the sweet bun (ice cream as spread)...weird, huh?  Tocino boys is a good take on mixing our favourite Filipino foods and turning into into something creative and new. Tocino boys has a small menu but all of the food are worth a try. The food are reasonably priced. The place is small and service is a little slow since there's only one person working in the kitchen...but you get to appreciate the food because there's always a personal touch to it. And you know exactly who's making it and how it's being made."}
{"text":"What a lovely little joint!!! For those who can't find it, it tucked into Midpoint Bar.  What I love about this place is that the owner is so passionate about his food. Introduced everything with love and guided us in what we had to try!    We had some TACOS- CHORIZO AND BEEF. Was pretty amazing, the shell tasted to fresh and a bit crunchy.   We had the BURGER, and it was so flavourful and massive, there was bacon, eggs and tocino rolling out everywhere.  We had the MANILLA FRIES WITH TOCINO. The tocino is so out of control, the owner here makes it so amazing and it was just cas eats and a good time.  We met some cool people and just had a great time.   Cool thing is, he serves street eats until 130 am, so for those fun nights out, go check this place out and get some MANILLA fries!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried a Tocino sandwich you are missing out. The sweet meat and buns make me question reality. The cheddar ice cream... I'm lactose intolerant but more importantly not eating delicious ice cream intolerant."}
{"text":"Tasting Menu - nuff said. (drops mic)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab some cheap tacos. $3.50. the corn tortillas were decent but I had one that was way overdone so it ruined the rest of the taco. The rest were pretty good. Especially the torito taco.   Tried the bae burger - It was good but with it being 6.99 plus 3.50 for the bacon and eggs ... That's a bit too expensive for just a burger.   The Canadian poutine was good $5, they used chicken based gravy which was def interesting. Haven't made up my mind on how I really feel since I like the OG.  This place is inside La Port. At the back. Service was good but a bit slow (probably my friends fault for talking to the chef the entire time)."}
{"text":"Tocino Boys is like a orgasm factory. Anything on the menu is out of this world. The Tocino Taco literally felt like fucking a unicorn in Magic Kingdom at Disney Land - it is a magical place. Tocino is Queen Street's hidden secret."}
