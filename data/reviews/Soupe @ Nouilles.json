{"text":"When it first opened this place had very good food at reasonable prices now however the prices have remained the same but the quality of the food has dropped.   My last experience (and it will be the last) was General Tao chicken, it was terrible! I've had better General Tao from the frozen aisle and I wish I was joking, but, I am DEAD SERIOUS. It was that bad.   The chicken itself was too hard and the heat was completely absent ... all I could taste was sweet upon sweet there was no balancing of the flavors. The rice ... Just awful I mean how can you mess up plain white rice? It's just cooking rice even I can do that. The rice was dry as hell."}
{"text":"Had to take away a star:( Went to pick up some Pad Thai just a few days ago, when I got it home, the portion was 2 times smaller then it use to be? What happened??? Then the noodles we lacking any sauce, and was totally stuck together. Of course I ate it but I was disappointed,  the last time I had gone there everything was perfection, and the key to great food is consistency, consistency, consistency. I'll be going back hoping it was just an off night. The service is great and I love the coziness of the place. Try it out and let me know how it was:)"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here, and eat once, even twice a week. Until the menu changed and the prices started to climb. It's understandable that a business needs to make money, but the for the amount of food we would order, it just didn't make sense to pay $10 or more for the same dishes that were $6-7 before.  It wasn't only that the prices had gone up, but that the quality of the food had started to decline, and then the portion sizes started to shrink. It just doesn't feel worthwhile to go there anymore.  This was only a personal opinion, the food was still alright, I guess I was just spoiled at how good this place used to be. So for those interested, it is worth giving it a try. They have a BYOB policy, plus the SAQ is across the street, and the staff has always been friendly. So no complaints there."}
