{"text":"Yesterday on March 18th during night time, My sister and I were cruising around the Yonge and Finch area, we wanted to try something different. I wanted to celebrated because i was done my mid-terms. My sister suggested and insisted me to try this new udon restaurant which recently opened. We walked there and tried it out. Honestly based on my own opinion, the food was good but the service was pretty horrible. It was a busy night because people were still celebrating St. Patty's day. Our waitress acted very snobby and rude towards me when i was trying to order. She elbowed me when she was cleaning the table and didn't even have the decency to say sorry. I asked her if she had wifi and she said no with a disturbing attitude. I know for most waitresses, waitressing is not a easy job because i was a waitress myself. I will not be coming back here again, not worth the visting."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 4/5

Food: Their texture of their house-made udon is very different from other places, more chewy and doesn't get soggy in the broths.
1. Original Kama udon: broth wasn't too heavy, didn't taste a lot of MSG, which was really refreshing.
2. Curry Udon with shrimp temprua: liquidy japanese curry, average but delicious.
3. Spicy seaweed ankake udon: (dried shrimp with thicker broth): this one was harder to share because we weren't given extra bowls and spoons to share amongst 6 people. (We didn't bother asking for them because we didn't have enough room on our table for 4 anyways.) You can taste the spiciness from the broth. The broth is definitely thicker than the kama udon, but not creamy. The seaweed were in tiny pieces, hard to get unless you are drinking the broth, which might be too salty alone, but great with the udon.
4. SALMON CREAM SAUCE UDON: One of my favourites!!! I love the creaminess!!
5. MENTAIKO CREAM SAUCE UDON: my other favourite!!! Also another creamy one. I think mentaiko is cod roe? It almost tastes like the seasoning from instant noodles but better. I can also get hints of fish roe in it, but not overpowering.
6. Black sesame puree udon with beef: I think this is the one people come to try. It's pretty good. I can taste the sesame, wasn't too strong, but it was a bit on the sweeter side relatively speaking, so I didn't prefer it as much. 
7. Oven baked udon: cheesy goodness. I really liked all their creamy ones. I can taste the american influence on this with all the cheese!!
8. Seafood yaki udon: lots of seafood. I was expecting it to be more dry, but it was a little watery.
9. Corn Kaki-age: Fried but not oily at all, and so good with the honey butter mayo. MUST TRY APP!!
10. Tako-wasa: Good but nothing special.

Atmosphere:
Small restaurant, but lively. Nice big front doors. The entrance of this place stands out from all the restaurants around the area. Huge bar for people to eat at. I came here on two different occasions, and they arranged the tables differently, more spacious the second time. However, for our group of 6, we were seated a table for 4, which was a little cramped with all the food we ordered to share. Maybe if we each ordered our own udon, it wouldn't have been as cramped. I think normally, they would attach another table of two to our table, but our reservations got messed up. The decor is different from the usual wooden theme I get from other Japanese restaurants. This one is a little more modern.

Service:
Both times I came on a Sunday night. We wanted reservations for 8pm, but we called around 7pm, and they were still able to accommodate the three of us. Second time, we made reservations a few days before for a group of 7 at 7pm. However, on the day of, we received a call saying they double booked by accident, and they pushed our reservations to 7:30pm. The owner personally came out to apologize for the mistake during our meal, which I thought was very considerate. When we got there, a little less than half the tables were vacant., but the tables quickly filled up by 8pm. There were always a couple of groups waiting for tables throughout the night. Second time around, the waiters were quick to respond to us, and our food didn't take long to come. Pretty efficient, considering that they were fully booked. They informed us that they were short-staffed the first time around, so I didn't rate their service from my initial visit.

Final thoughts: Definitely make reservations if you have a big party. Apparently, they have stopped taking reservations for tables of 2 though."}
{"text":"Really overrated and overpriced. $14 for oven baked udon which is basically Alfredo sauce on udon. The spicy pork udon wasn't even spicy and the soup was warm, not hot... Portions are small too."}
{"text":"I visited the same location before and it was another upscale Japanese restaurant. The experience was great so I went there again yesterday.

Apparently it is owned by different owner. I was seated, found the seats are so small, and very close to the neigh borough tables. Very simple tables and chairs like students in a school. 

Lots of young people. The waitress was nice. Surprisingly there is no bento box but have variety of Udon noodles and salads. 

I will not go back as it is not a upscale typical Japanese restaurant, although the Udon is not bad."}
{"text":"The udon was very bland and in general not anything I would go out of my way again to pay for the noodle;  I find the restaurant vibes make up for a lack of taste in their dishes. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the place was packed. Waited 20mins and got seats at the bar looking in to the kitchen. 
Ordered: 
torched mackerel- The mackerel was average, basically the same as everywhere else that might have it on the menu. a little bit expensive for the portion size. 
corn kaki- not bad. basically saw everyone in the restaurant ordered this. I cannot really see why. it was fried nice and all but at the end its just corn fritters. 
mentaiko cream udon - this was good. very creamy and the udon had a nice chew to it. the portion might seem small but it is very very filling and heavy. i like it but not sure if i would order again. 
Ordered a Delirium beer and was surprised to see they actually had it on tap. 
Overall an ok experience. wouldn't mind going back to try some other types of udon but would skip the appetizers."}
{"text":"The udon noodles were nothing special--but the pork belly and deep-fried okra appetizers were amazing."}
{"text":"1) the udon is a must try!! We had the baked udon and black sesame and must say that was the highlight!!!!

2) The ambience and decor is pretty cool. From the fancy front door to the antique lighting, everything is pretty snazzy.

3) love the music that was being played that night. Really fits the mood- very lively and energetic."}
{"text":"I came here by myself. I don't like udon,because it's too thick . But the environment here is elegant."}
{"text":"I came into this place with relatively  low expectations, as my wife wanted to try it.  Apologies on being crude, but how expensive is udon?!  The frozen udon costs $7 for two packs (6pp).  I don't know what fresh hand-made udon tastes like, but this tasted very similar to the frozen kind I make at home.  But they never advertise they make it fresh everyday.

With skepticism in tow, there was a variety of different udon dishes on the menu, but we ended ordering the corn app, a curry udon and the thick soup udon.  The corn was was good, a must try if you like sweet corn.  Onto the udon dishes.  The thick soup was THICK, like miso soup with tonnes of cornstarch.  It had a pleasant flavor, presented nicely.  The real kicker was the curry, that was VERY delicious.  There were different flavors hitting the tongue then going down the throat.  It had much more flavor than Gyugyuya, a restaurant that specializes in Japanese curry.  I guess Korean curry tastes better, IMO."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING! Started out with incompetent and poor service. I was then given the wrong udon dish, but decided to keep it anyway. That night and the day after, I had horrible stomachaches with fluids coming out of both ends, a likely result of improperly cooked pork in the udon."}
{"text":"First time being here after all the Instagram photos! 

Was here with the bride and the maid of honor, casual get together. When I first walked in I love the atmosphere already! The place was around the corner you cannot miss this place if u wanted too! I was greeted once I stepped my foot in and was asked if I'm good with the patio, in my mind I was thinking I thought you'll never ask !! So that got me excited! 

The patio was cute, roughly 4 tables were on the patio and was cute wooden tables and all. After the friends had arrived we started to order, we got the pork belly, Corn-kakage, and the beef sashimi as apps. The pork belly was a bit dry for my liking , nothing too special. The beef sashimi was actually pretty good, but I believe they missed our order because it came after all the entree. Apparently we were served by a trainee and therefore they missed up our order with a different table. And lastly the corn, nothing too special the dipping sauce that came with it tasted weird as in sweeet and vinegar was mixed together. Did not fancy the the 2 apps that much. 


Main course we got 2 udon curry and one salmons udon... the curry potatoes was one of there specialty for the night, the sauce did not amaze me but they did very well with the presentation . The salmon udon was good but too heavy. 

Overall it's a good place for friends to get together but was not amazed with the food. Is it worth a 2 visit, if I'm in area I'll pick this place because I know what type of food they have but will not purposely visit again."}
{"text":"Frozen vs fresh udon.  Age old question like butter vs margarine.  Now I've had udon many times before.  Typically it's the frozen variety that you can get at any asian supermarket and I have to admit they are very good.  Does making it fresh as MeNami does make it better than the frozen variety as Menami claims?  

One way to find out!  Had the udon with tempura as I wanted to try the udon with the brooth without too many flavours to really try the udon.  The udon definitely had a nice bite to it, not soggy and bit firm.  The brooth was excellent if a bit too salty but nice flavour and matched the udon nicely.  Tempura was nice, nothing spectacular.  

The menu had a lot of other dishes that sound very good.  This place looks like they thought about the menu and the dishes complement the feel and look of the restaurant.  So even if udon doesn't do much for you, there are lots of other dishes to try.

So is fresh udon better than frozen?  Looks like I'll have to go back many times to be sure ;)  Oh...and the music is da bomb, love it."}
{"text":"I was a little dubious about this place at first since I've had some pretty sub par ramen around the area but was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the an appetiser with some fried chicken breasts and they were so delicious! It was so fresh, there were juices coming from it and the meat was not dry at all. The ramen itself was quite delicious and the part I enjoyed the most were the fresh noodles. You could tell they were handmade and the owner even came out herself to check with us and let us know that it was fresh. The prices weren't ridiculous either. 

All in all, great service and fantastic and fresh food! We will definitely stop by again soon."}
{"text":"Finally an excellent restaurant on Yonge that I'm actually impressed by. Food is important but the  decoration and general atmosphere is too. These guys have great taste and style.  I ordered the oven baked cheese udon with bacon, shrimp and scallop.  I'll have to say that dish was 10 over 10. it's been a while since I've tried such an excellent fusion food. We also ordered house made sake, again I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food. A great spot to check out while you're in the area and looking for some udon ;)"}
{"text":"I think I expected too much from this place, seeing it weekend after weekend having huge lineups. 
The atmosphere was very cool and instagrammable. 
I like that they had a short menu, I guess only trying to focus on food that they can cook good. The hotpot was okay, I definitely have had better for cheaper.  Nothing really note worthy here... Except oh, I really like their door."}
{"text":"This place sort of reminds me of Guu and Nome-type izakaya places, but a bit more toned down. It's not as rowdy, but there are similar tapas style dishes available. We tried the corn kakiage (fried corn fritters) and the spicy salmon tartare, both of which were really good. The corn fritters were especially a bit weird (in a good way) cause it was slightly sweet, but also savoury. 

Then we ordered two udons, which were definitely not Guu-size -- they were a lot bigger, and I could only finish half of mine. My partner ordered the spicy pork udon, which was spicy pork belly and came with soup, and I ordered the creamy salmon, which was a kind of Asian twist on carbonara. He loved his, and mine was also perfect for what I was craving -- a pasta-style non-soupy, stick to your ribs kind of dish. You can tell that udon is actually MeNami's specialty because we sat at the bar, and watched them constantly turn out fresh udon noodles. The noodles themselves were reeeeeally good and you could taste the freshness and bounciness and chewiness with each bite! 

The food also came out ridiculously fast, and service was great. We'll come back here for more udon, for sure :)"}
{"text":"Food was good but be careful of owner and management. Be aware of their prices. All prices are $1-2 dollars more than on their chalkboard and soju list. Anyways we found out that tips do not go to the waitresses but instead goes to the owners pocket. We asked about the bill discrepancy but we had to wait for manager.  We waited 20 mins still nothing? Keep in mind this is already 1am and we're all tired. So we decided to leave a minor tip. Guess what? The manager or owner ran outside and chased us down to demand a bigger tip? We advised that the tip we gave and your price discrepancy will cover your so called \"tip\". She refused and said because we walked out we agreed on the bill. This girl totally ruined our night.  I will never come back unless they start to share their tips to their waitresses. Best of luck to their workers."}
{"text":"If you love udon as much as I do, this is the place to go to. They make their udon fresh! It's so chewy and yummy! They make their udon in a number of ways, all taste amazing. Their beef and salmon tataki are fantastic. You can tell the chef really puts effort into the quality of the food as well as the aesthetics of the food.

The service was amazing and there's parking conveniently located around the restaurant! 

You won't be disappointed! Yum!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my recent experience

Service: Absolutely terrible. Although we came on a Sunday evening, it wasn't as busy as my first visit. After sitting 3 of us down, they didn't even offer us a menu. I had to go across the restaurant to get a menu for our group. Waving for some service didn't even help (which we did 5 times) as the waitresses seem to avoid eye contact with their customers as they walked by. The table next to us asked for water and had to get it themselves. We had to approach them to give our order. 

Food: Getting the meal was quicker than getting the waitress attention.

Chicken kara-age ($6.50): Crispy and light battered

Oven baked udon ($14): there was more sauce than noodles and seafood combined. 

Curry udon with shrimp tempura ($11): tempura was just as crispy and curry was very delicious

Tonkatsu ($10): not the greatest since they specialize in udon, but the pork cutlet tasted very bland 

Although the food was decent, the service really hindered us from enjoying it. The decor is nice and the restaurant is clean  but I won't make my way to come here unless a friend really wants to go"}
{"text":"Came here late on a weekday. It was decently busy for a Tuesday but service was quick and we got our food soon after we had ordered. 

Atmosphere was hipstery and cozy. Liked how the music wasn't overpowering and that it wasn't too dim. They also had a nice bar area with a great selection of drinks. 

We ordered quite a few things. Appetizers included the pork belly (my favourite app), chicken kirage (could've been more crispy but was very tender), and the beef tataki (thicker and slightly more tough than the usual tataki I get but I liked it better this way and it has a nice peppery flavour to it so it's very refreshing).

For mains we ordered the yaki niku udon which had beef and oyster mushrooms in soup. The soup was simple and didn't overpower the beef or noodles. Although, I found the noodles to be a bit overcooked. Also had the over baked udon which was very savory. It had shrimp and scallop all covered in cream sauce and cheese. Finally, we tried the black sesame pureé with beef, my personal favourite. It was mixed with a black sesame sauce which was a bit on the sweeter side. Very unique and went well with the beef. 

Overall, great experience and will definitely be back. I just wish they served dessert too."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique spot with delicious food and drinks. I'd come back again! Everything was delicious. 

Went here with 2 friends one night to celebrate a belated birthday, though parking was a bit tough to find (it always is in this area) it was a great night. We tried the Salmon Cream Sauce Udon, the baked udon with shrimp, scallops and tex mex cheese, spicy pork udon, Chicken karage, and tako wasa. For drinks we tried the Thai Iced Tea and the Yuzu Mojito. 

The noodles all had lots of flavour and were great sizes to fill you. Be aware, the baked udon and salmon cream are extra creamy. I personally love cream sauce and it had great flavour but for you lactose intolerant people, you might want to just try it and skip eating a whole bowl. The Spicy pork udon had a nice kick to it. 

Appetizers were great, chicken karage was big, juicy and crispy and came with a great dipping sauce. The tako wasa had a wasabi kick to it. I'm not one to usually eat raw octopus but I tried it and I didn't mind it.

The drinks were great, both distinctive flavours and tasty. The thai Iced tea was really really good and had a strong tea taste.

Ambiance was a casual place with cowboy bar-like feel with an asian fusion twist. We were sat by the door which happened to be open that day. It got chilly as the night went on but we just asked the waiter to close the door and they gladly obliged. 

Service was good, we had no complaints. They did ask us to wrap up towards the end of our stay but we had been there for over 3 hours before they did so. All in all a great experience and will be back to try more udon dishes!"}
{"text":"My co-worker treated me for lunch here in April and I would definitely return.

I love udon and the only place I really knew that served half decent udon was manpuku, but wanted to find a new place to indulge my love of noodles.

Udon is the highlight; we had the oven baked udon and the mentaiko cream sauce udon (the latter being a recommendation from the server who said it is very popular with young ladies!). The oven baked version was quite heavy with cheese and I wasn't able to finish it.  During the summer I would probably choose something lighter, but it was still quite cold out and felt like comfort food.  The mentaiko was really good and perhaps even better than the oven-baked!

We also ordered some appetizers but I don't think I would re-order (they were tasty, but pricey).

My friend was Korean and maybe that made the servers treat us extra nice - they gave us ice cream (at no cost!) because we wanted to order dessert but they didn't really have any desserts to speak of.

Overall, the space was very nice, service was quite good and the udon is delicious and unique."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place finally opened up! And it definitely lived up to its expectations :)

Corn Kaki-age & Salmon Tartare (4.5/5): The salmon tartare was AWSOME! It's more like cubed salmon mixed with spicy creamy sauce (?) that sat perfectly on top of the fried wonton wrapper. Thought it was neat spin on the appetizer and is something I'd recommend for anyone! Now the corn kaki-age was a surprise. It's a sweet fritter served with honey butter. Took alittle getting used to at first, but in the end I enjoyed the sweet crunchy deep fried corn :)

Spicy Pork Udon (4/5): first of all.. NOT SPICY AT ALL! And I have a LOW spice tolerance so that's saying something. However that doesn't mean it took away from the dish. The udon itself is long and definitely held itself together (unlike frozen udon) which was nice for slurping. I thought the pork was still well seasoned as to taste it's attempt at being spicy. I liked the seaweed shavings that was served on top, it actually added to experience, but I did end up picking out all the onion.. Did not expect so much in the soup.

Service (2.5/5): EHHHH they didn't seem happy, they did the bare minimum and looked like they could get ticked off easily. They answered our questions about the menu almost reluctantly but it wasn't so bad that I'd complain about it? Overall, below standard service I'd expect to receive at other restaurants.

Cost (3/5): Paid around $26 for the udon, a can of pop, and split the price of the apps with my friend, so nothing to complain about here! 

Ambience (4.5/5): What a snazzy place. Well thought out, however it doesn't seem like a place good for groups. Most tables are for 2 and some for 4. The bar area and the chalkboard menu look great and overall the place felt cool/slightly hipster-ish.

Last note: they have a great selection of beer and sake that you wouldn't want to pass up so definitely come by and try it along with their huge selection of different udons! Can't wait to go back and try their creamy udons :3"}
{"text":"Just cuz I've been craving udon. The place is new, the food is good (we ordered the mentai cream udon and oden and the chefs gave us corn kakiage), the review will probably change over time since I like going several times to check a place out.

But definitely worth it. The udon texture and the... chewiness of the udon was spot on. Definitely coming back to try out the other stuff on the menu. Reason why it's not full stars is that I sat at the bar and those chairs are uncomfortable lol"}
{"text":"The food here is impeccable. I've gone a few times and will always return. Good ambience friendly staff and the food is worth every single penny."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my friend when it recently opened. 

The udon is suppose to be \"handmade\", but it literally tasted like frozen korean udon from the grocery store with miso broth/ dashi added. We tried the karage and beef tataki as apps. The karage was dry, and the tataki was a thick cut of beef (but the wrong cut) so it was chewy. 

I had the black sesame udon. I enjoyed the first two bites and then it got very overwhelming of cream and butter with sesame. 

We literally went home and ordered pizza after. 

Will not recommend this place. HBT is better. 
Though the namanama sake was really good. (Made in the Distillery district Sake shop)"}
{"text":"I did not have high expectations on service based on some of other reviews, but I never would have expected to be fully ignored while making eye contact with multiple waiters for over 5 minutes upon entering and standing right by their host desk.  Also took over 20 mins to flag down someone to take our order (no one tried to come talk or even make eye contact) and never once got our teas refilled. We felt literally invisible as it was pretty clear that they were much more proper and attentive to some other customers - and bear in mind that we gave no attitude or anything whatsoever.

Food was okay. The tsuke tempura udon only had 1 shrimp tempura. The black sesame udon was not bad, but just a bit strange because it was on the sweet side (also had very little toppings). Not the best udon by a long shot in my opinion and not worth the price or the wait, and especially the frustration of dealing with their poor customer service. Truly do not understand the hype. 

Side note: they tried to bring us a drink and a third udon that we didn't order on separate occasions."}
{"text":"As a regular patron in the North York area - primarily in the Yonge/Finch area, my business represents thousands of dollars in revenue.  Why?  I bring about a dozen people with me when I go drinking and they become regular customers as well.  

I have been to just about every restaurant, bar, and business in this area and started to get tired of trying new places.  Menami was one local bar that I wanted to try - I don't go there to eat - and so, on my third visit yesterday (Jan 2) there were two people serving: 1) Caucasian waitress, and 2) a Korean guy.  I saw about 4 tables occupied (probably about 10 people in total in the bar) and I hear them saying it was \"busy\".  The music was a little loud and they had one TV that was on CTV Two (Barrie) channel for some reason.  For 11pm on a Monday night...I guess you can call it that.  I order my first beer and took my time drinking it and scoping out the place and their service.  About 10 minutes later I asked for a shot of Smirnoff vodka.  After I finish it; they cleared it when I went to the washroom and when I came they didn't come to me at all to see if there was anything else I wanted.  So, I timed them to see how long before they came to ask me anything and I even made eye contact with both of them.  They seemed bored and totally oblivious, constantly checking on their phones and the girl even at one point sat down.  18 minutes later, I decided to ask for a beer and the girl (still oblivious) asked me a question which I paid no attention to and nodded my head.

When it came time to pay the bill, I was even more annoyed at the whole experience when I saw that the bill came out to over $20 for only 2 domestic beers, and one shot.  You'd think that they would lower their prices for a Monday night to attract customers.  Terrible experience.  Just some pointers for the people at Menami: never let your guard down, you may never know who might come in.  If it's not the weekend, you don't need to blare the music - there's no dance floor, so you can tone it down a bit.  Change the channel to either a sports channel (Sportsnet, TSN) or CP24.  People when bored, will instantly look at the TV but when you have a boring channel on, they will simply fade out and leave early.

Edit: 7/11/17. Caucasian girl no longer works here.  I have been a \"regular\" for the last 3-4 months now.  I have no doubt that it had nothing to do with the skin colour. But; that being said, the service has tremendously gotten better. I can ask for \"service\" (ie food or drinks) so long as it's not unreasonable. Keep in mind that I probably spend about $1000/month here though. Chai - the owner, has bee beyond excellent in trying to be a business owner but provide customer service. A lot of the regular staff has been nothing short but amazing in turning around the service and kudos go to: Alex, Ethan, James, Hanna, Cindy, to name a few. This is now my regular \"watering hole\" and as a result of the amazing customer service and their goal to provide fresh and quality food equates to a busier bar. If I could retract my rating - I would.  And it would be 4.5/5."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my friend as we had heard good things about this place. We made a reservation for 7:30pm on a Saturday night for two. Unfortunately we were running late so I called beforehand to let them know ahead of time to push it to 7:45. We didn't get to the restaurant until 8pm. They gave away our table - which was disappointing, but we understood as this was a small restaurant. Finally, after waiting about 20 minutes, we were seated at the bar.

I ordered the Black Sesame Udon. It came out pitch black. It didn't look really appetizing and I was a bit turned off due to the colour but it turned out to be delicious and it was really unique (I would have never thought to make Udon with a Black Sesame sauce). It was a bit too sweet for me and I was not a big fan of the beef slices (it reminded me of the beef slices you cook in hot pot). This dish was worth the try though. My friend ordered the Oven Baked Udon which was drenched in cheese and had seafood in it with a cream sauce. It was delicious (anything with cheese is delicious). But it got  very sickening very quickly. She could barely finish it. We also ordered two \"Tapas\" - the Chicken Karaage (Fried Chicken), and the Salmon Tataki. The Chicken Karaage was SO GOOD. It was so crispy and the dipping sauce it came with was amazing! Unfortunately - our Salmon Tataki never came. It was odd as the servers had come by and asked us if we were still waiting for our Salmon Tataki. We said yes, we were still waiting, but it still never came. Nonetheless, we were too full to have it any way. 

We also had two cocktail drinks. I ordered the Geisha - which was a very fruity alcoholic beverage. My friend ordered the Sailor Moon Gone Wild - it literally tasted like a mojito. It had so much lime in it. They made the drinks in front of us and you can really tell they put a lot of time and passion in making it - although the bartender forgot a decorative apple slices piece on my drink and had added it in after he gave me the drink. 

Overall, the food was good, but the service was mediocre."}
{"text":"This has been on my list of to-tries for a verrrryyy long time and made it here during Halloween weekend. 

So of course, tried the corn kaki-age. It was different but didn't wow me to Mars. I really liked how they look a different spin to a fried dish. 

Also had the tako wasa. No surprises here, yummy like many other Japanese places. I would see myself coming back here to try the other appys 

My personal favorite udon of the night was the mentaiko cream sauce udon! Menami does this the best!! 

Also tried the black sesame puree udon with beef, and it really wasn't my thing. It had a sweet flavour to it, reminded me a little like a dessert and felt really odd as a udon. Again, personal preference."}
{"text":"Ramen shops seems to be all the craze right now but so far they've all been overhyped instant noodle meh. Udon sake bar? Well hello! 

Ordered the king prawn dish, apparently it's the dish that got the chef the job and I can totally see why. It's was tasty and wasn't just drizzled in the usual mayo but a twist of chili mayo sauce that worked perfectly with the prawns. Salmon cream udon was a bit too creamy for my liking and reminded me of Alfredo pasta. Tempura okra yummy!

Cozy and trendy place with attentive service. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I haven't been back here since my last review and I have to say the experience is no longer the same, especially when I had FOOD POISONING from my meal this time.

I ordered the black sesame udon and when I got home, I ended up vomiting all night long. 

Aside from the food poisoning, the service here is spotty. They're not that busy but don't allow you to sit wherever you like. The server did not have the best attitude either. 

After getting so sick here, I definitely won't be back to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I loved the tapas here, but was not as impressed with the udon and soups. I think I tried pretty much every one of the appetizers and the ones that stood out were the chicken karaage, korokke and corn kaki-age. 

The restaurant decor was cute and the service was fine."}
{"text":"Second time here, it's the type of place that I'll go to when friends can't seem to decide where we want to go. People don't really complain bout udon and they have enough different style udons to choose from. 

Consistent with the first time I came here I would say the seasoning and use of sauces is spot on. The prices are mid- range, but nothing in particular really stands out but nothing is poor either. 

Presentation and service here is generally good."}
{"text":"Great Oysters & Sliders on Mondays and Wednesdays. Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I love the udons here, very chewy and yumm! Came here yesterday with a date and enjoyed the vibe and great service. Try the Nagasaki Udon and ask for it a bit spicier. For an appetizer, I recommend trying the corn-kaki-age"}
{"text":"I visited with my friend to try their udon. I ordered the kitsune udon to try their noodles. The waitress told me it would take a while because they had to make the noodles fresh.
After 20 minutes of waiting, what I got was a rather simple combination of udon noodles, broth, and a large piece of kitsune. The taste was okay, but it was mostly coming from the seasoned kitsune, and not so much from the noodles. In fact, I didn't think the noodles were as good as they were advertised. I also felt the portion was small for a $11 meal. Overall, my experience was not great. 
However, this places has many other things to offer than just udon noodles, and the atmosphere was great. So I may come back for a drink and to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Was quite disappointed, given the hype around this new udon joint. The udon doesn't come with much toppings (one tempura shrimp for the tempura udon and one piece of chicken for the kake udon). Both service and food quality was only mediocre and quite ridiculous given the high price point of the food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner - thank goodness for reservations, because on a Friday night, it was totally packed!  In fact, our table by the door was literally totally eclipsed by the hordes of hungry people waiting by the doorway.

I almost feel bad then, that they could look at the food coming to our table yet not able to actually eat anything.  Eye hungry?

We ordered the corn kaki-age, smoked salmon with parsnip sauce, mentaiko cream sauce udon, and the oven baked udon.  

Though the fried corn was relatively tasty, I think I was a little disappointed in the honey butter dipping sauce.  After eating my weight in honey butter Calbee, I was expecting the corn to taste exactly like that, but somehow it was a little less flavourful.  Maybe it's the MSG in the chips that makes the difference?  It still wasn't bad though.  

The smoked salmon was a pleasant surprise in that it was literally smoked salmon - as in sashimi salmon that's been blow-torched, aburi-style.

The mentaiko udon was more creamy than mentaiko-y; which completely lost its mentaiko flavour once poked off its basil leaf and mixed in with the noodles and sauce.  Next time I'll be more careful and make sure to scoop up even ratios with the noodles.  

Mmm, udon..."}
{"text":"After a couple of visits, I'd have to say this restaurant is a decent place for udon, but it's nothing special. The tapas are a bit overpriced for what you get, however we did enjoy the karaage, corn kakiage, and korokke (deep fried mashed potato). 

I tried the mentaiko cream sauce udon ($12) the first time, and I enjoyed it. The roe gave the dish an interesting texture and it had a hint of spiciness. On our most recent visit, I had the oven baked udon ($14) with shrimp, scallop, bacon, green peppers, white onions, and tex mex. I basically love anything smothered in melted cheese so this was a winner. 

We came back because it's at a convenient location for us and I like the modern decor. The service isn't great but it's more inattentiveness than rudeness. Hopefully that'll get smoothed out as they go along."}
{"text":"This restaurant is famous of its udon. There is a variety of udon selection. It also has tapas food and a wide choices of beer and sake."}
{"text":"Got elastic band in my udon. Never again guys. Waitress was a bit rude too. Nothing special in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of udon and soupy meals, and this MeNami just hit the spot.  MeNami is on the corner of the street and visible from Yonge and its front doors are these huge solid wooden doors.  The decor inside is dark with rustic wooden furniture and mostly small tables.  

Had the sukiyaki here with udon - it's a bit more soupy than I expected for sukiyaki but the flavour is great.  A lot more veggies than meat and you must be careful not to let the meat sit for too long to avoid over cooking.  A sukiyaki or pot is enough for two to share.

I would love there to be more items on the menu to try.  So far the menu is a bit repetitive with few options for appetizers.  Great place with a good vibe that has lots of potential.  Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Casual dine-in joint that serves a variety of insanely creative fusion food. I stumbled upon here last summer due to the huge doors that grabbed my attention and safe to say I have no regrets. (Makes it easy to find too - very smart designing) 

It serves as a lot of the other restaurants around the area such as HBT or Nome, very loud music and a young staff. It's another one of those places where you can drink and indulge on some finger foods, or even a meal. The servers don't say much throughout the entire stay, but I'm not complaining as long as the food gets to me in one piece. 

I've yet to try out their range of different udon dishes but out of them all I've tried the salmon cream sauce udon as well as the oven-baked udon. And BRUH. The heaviness of the cream sauce and the cheese makes you super full even though the portion doesn't seem to do justice. Out of the appetizers, I've tried most of what they have to offer and needless to say, everything tastes yummy! My definition of yummy: flavourful, fresh, and looks appetizing."}
{"text":"I came with a few friends to MeNami on a weekday around 6:30. We made a reservation, so we were promptly seated. This restaurant gets pretty busy, so it would be wise to make a reservation if you don't want to wait. There is ample parking around the area.

For a starter to share, we had the Convention Grilled Pork Belly. It came with 6 pieces of pork belly with some spring mix veggies and onion to complement it. The taste was good, but I thought for the price (11$) it was not worth it. 

For the main course, we ordered two types of udon. The restaurant is known for their udon, we wanted to try one with a soup base, and one that was cold. We ordered the Yiki Niku Udon (with beef, oyster mushrooms in a soup base) and a Cold Udon w/ Tempura. The Yiki Niku Udon was very tasty, and I especially like the soup base, which was flavourful but not too salty or overwhelming. This was the first time that I had a cold udon, and I actually enjoyed it alot. It comes with a dipping sauce that is very flavourful. The tempura was battered very nicely and had just the right amount. The only downside was that there were only 3 pieces of tempura, with only one piece of Shrimp. It would have been nice to have 2 shrimp tempura.

Overall, I would definitely return to MeNami and recommend it to anybody who like Udon noodles."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service! I went there twice this week. I went on a Thursday evening (7:00pm) and Saturday lunch time (12:30pm) at those times I went it was not busy and I got a table right away. The servers there are friendly. The food didn't take long. It took roughly 25-30 mins to come to my table. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about this place.  Saw this restaurant featured in Toronto Life magazine.  Ordered the beef Niku-Yaki udon and the soup was not that hot and the slices of beef were all lumped together which make it taste tough.  My husband had the regular Kama udon which he thought was just average.  We also ordered the Chicken Karaage which was nicely battered and juicy.  The decor was nice however the service here was poor and the servers were lazy.  Being that this place specializes in udon noodles, I didn't feel that the texture of their noodles were anything close to unique."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I ordered the curry shrimp tempura udon, the chicken karage and the corn kaki age which was all equally delicious. The chicken was juicy and the curry was not too strong and the corn was sweet and crunchy! Menami is a great place to hang out with your friends and family!"}
{"text":"The fiancé was getting a haircut nearby, after we decided to check out what was behind those huge iron fortress looking doors ~ 

We came on a saturday afternoon, around lunch time. It was busy but we got lucky a table just cleared up for us. Their menu had a lot of choices, but not so much where you feel overwhelmed.  This was a tapas styled bar, had a lot of appetizers, but we wanted to try their udon dishes instead.  

{Corn Kaki-age}
So for the first appetizer we ordered the corn kaki-age because I LOVE CORN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.  I expected it to be sorta just like the mayo and baked cheese on top kinda corn. But it came out in 5 \"fried corn cheese balls\". It also had a light sweet mayo dipping sauce. When we bit into it....oh my gawjjjjjj IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I felt like they added cheese to hold it altogether. And that was GENIUS CAUSE IT WAS ALL SO GOOD. A little bit crunchy from the fried cheese, light creamy mayo taste that complimented the corn x 1000000! To be honest I would be happy to just eat 3 orders of this fried corn cheese ball dish!! Highly recommend this to everyone that loves corn and cheese!! 

{Spicy Salmon Tartare}
Was gonna order the takowasa  like usual, but was feeling adventurous and wanted to try more tartare (like my Nome tartare experiance )! So I ordered the spicy salmon tartare. This dish came with deep fried wonton skin chips. The flavour was phenominal! This looks like a simple salmon tartare dish with crushed black peppers and habanero oil, but the flavours are rich and complexed. The habanero oil they used really brought out the salmon! I was surprised that they didn't use sriracha and mayo, which is what I'm used to. But mixed the salmon in habanero oil and adding the mayo on top for you to mix. I loved the aroma of the habanero oil, it really compliments the salmon.  The only thing I didn't like was that the salmon cubes were a bit too big. It was weird to eat giant cubes of salmon on such a small triangle of wonton skins. Nevertheless it was a refreshing dish to our creamy udon dishes! 

{Salmon Cream Sauce Udon}
We both wanted to try the cream sauce udon, so he chose to order the salmon cream sauce udon. When the dish arrived it was interesting seeing the tomato oil on top! I've never seen tomato oil before  The salmon was cooked PERFECTLY! We both were so impressed, it was tender, and very rich with umami flavours. It tasted like it was cooked with garlic which we LOVED. The udon was cooked just right for us. We like it not too hard but just soft enough where it has texture when you bite down When you mixed everything together, the crazy umami flavours from the garlic salmon, the tomato oil, and the cream sauce oh my gawwwwwj! It's delicious! Not too rich either which was very surprising, because of the amount of cream sauce in the dish. But of course if you decide to finish all the cream...that would be a bit too creamy then.  Very impressed with our first udon choice!

{Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon} 
I saw a post of a fellow foodie with the mentaiko cream sauce udon dish and I had to try it!  The mentaiko came on top of a shisho leaf with chopped green onions. I know was meant to be mixed together but it was so pretty. Took me a little while before mixing everything together.... The flavour of this pasta dish was also phenomenal! Although the mentaiko flavour is not really strong due to the amount of cream, but the spicy tomato oil still added a lot of rich umami flavours (and look at that gorgeous colour it adds to the dish!!). I would still prefer more of the spicy mentaiko flavour though.  Like the other cream sauce udon, this was also complexed in flavour!  I still enjoyed this dish very much! The udon noodle itself was also cooked perfectly to our liking. We were very very impressed with this cream sauce udon as well! We were happy we finally got to try out this place for lunch time. Next time I would like to try out their sukiyaki dish!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch last weekend.  The space is really nice and the servers were friendly.  Not sure if it's cause they're new but our server mixed us up pointing is to the opposite sides of the menu for soup based and stir fried udon so what we ordered came out totally opposite (is thought it would be stir fried but noodle came out as soup noodle).  Nonetheless the dishes were very tasty.  Our friend had the black sesame and we tasted it and it was very unique.  I had a beef and mushroom udon that was very fragrant.  My husband had the Japanese Curry one.  We were very happy with the lunch and would go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening around 9pm, the place wasn't very busy and seating was available right away.  The decors and ambiance is somewhat rustic and chic with a bar-like atmosphere.  

Ordered several tapa dishes as well as one of their Udon noodles.  The tapas portions are REALLY small here, which I guess is probably why they called them Tapas.  A little pricy given the $ they charge for each dish.  

The Udon i ordered was like unlike typical udon noodles I've had in other restaurants, it was more like Italian pasta with no soup broth at all.. The taste was kind of blend, and I didn't really like it much...

I have heard many of my friends that liked this place for its decors and food..I would say that the ambiance is above average in a lounge/bar kind of setting, however foodwise it left much to be desired in my experience, probably won't be visiting this place too often in the future."}
{"text":"The owner of Han Ba Tang came up and introduce herself to my table as we were prepared to order. She told us that the udon is freshly made and gave us a couple of recommendations. I am a huge fan of Han Ba Tang and this new venture does not disappoint.

These are what my table ordered from the tapas menu: 
-Corn Kaki-age, smoked salmon with parsnip sauce, albacore tuna tataki, roasted hamachi kama and korokke. We each ordered an individual food item as a main dish and I ordered the salmon cream sauce udon.

All the tapas were really great. The best out of all of them is the corn kaki-age. This dish is very unique and I've never tried deep fried corn before. It is a must try. I wish that the order had more since we each had only one bite of it. Smoke salmon with parsnip sauce and alabacore tuna tataki tasted exactly like seared sashimi. I am a huge fan of croquettes and the korokke was a dish that I really enjoyed. The outside is crispy while the inside was creamy with mashed potato. The roasted hamachi kama was just alright. I think it lacked a bit of salt and flavour though.

For my main, I tried the salmon cream sauce udon. Udon in cream sauce is very good. The salmon on top was cooked perfectly (medium rare-ish) and it was moist. The udon was the main highlight as it was full with flavour mixed with the cream sauce. 

I definitely will be coming back in the future and I want to try the different types of udon."}
{"text":"I saw the great reviews about the cheesy oven baked udon so I had to check it out for myself. The udon itself wasn't any different from what you would buy at the grocery nor was the melted cheddar mozzarella cheese baked on top. The scallops, shrimp & bacon were fine. This dish could easily be reproduced at home. When I'm paying $17 for something I would expect it to taste umami & unique that I myself cannot create.  This dish was very predictable and boring.  This is yet another example of an overpriced and hyped up trendy restobar."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for dinner one time and when i got there- the waiter said he could not find my reservation when i fully left my name and phone number for a waiter that worked there the night before.
So when we arrived, we had to wait for about 10 minutes which was not too long so it was ok.

We ordered the seafood yaki udon, oven baked udon, corn kaki-age & tako-wasa.
The oven baked udon is a bit on the heavy side - so it's better for sharing.
I must say the corn kaki-age was AMAZING !! I would even make my way here JUST to have this dish lol. Their dipping sauce for the fried corn was so unique and tastey! 
It is a must try item from the menu!

Last but not least, they have a secret drink menu - where you can order Thai icetea cocktail (has alcohol). I actually ordered one without alcohol and it still tasted good- there is actually coconut added in it which makes it a bit different from your regular thai iced tea.

Overall this is a great place to go to if you are craving for japanese style udon."}
{"text":"Had a great night here for my birthday, the food was amazing quality. Their seasonal specials were out of this world. I myself had the \"Potato Curry Udon\". And yes, yes they do have a cocktail called \"Sailor Moon Gone Wild\". The decor was very hip and bright which I always love about restaurants.

The only reason it's not a 5 stars for me is that the service was extremeeeelllyyyy slow. It was very difficult to get the waiters attention... The food though was 5/5. I would go back in a heartbeat if it were JUST about the food, but because of the REALLY slow service I might check out some other Japanese restaurants in North York before making it my \"go to\"."}
{"text":"Pros: food is good, servers are cute and they play hiphop.

Cons: the servers rushed to take our order and run off to do their chores (drying off utensils and plates) never came to refill our water or asked once if we wanted another round of drinks or if we were doing ok at all. When we got our bill, all the items on our bill came to be $1 or $2 more than it was shown on the menu and signs. When we brought that to their attention, the server admitted that they haven't changed their menus yet but we can talk to the manager. We waited.. But the manager never came. We paid the bill and gratituity and  told the girl to bring it up to the manager herself, and the difference would be her tip. THEN, she smiled and said that it all goes to management anyway.

That's really upsetting. Don't think i'd come back if a girl willingly told us that. I wanted to speak to the manager about not paying their servers.. But i hope this does more."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday and it was really packed inside but still managed to get seats pretty quickly. The food was really good. Read a lot of good reviews about their corn kaki-age and it did not disappoint. Got their curry udon and black sesame udon and both were very delicious! Portions look small but it was still very filling. It was a little loud inside which makes it hard for conversation, just have to talk a little louder! Also tried their matcha drunken tea and an aloe cocktail. Good alcohol ratio, but on the lesser end. All in all, would come here again to try out some other stuff on their menu. 
Ambience: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I must've passed by this place at least a dozen times without noticing it, they offer tapas, udon, and sake. Hipster decor and a young crowd make it an ideal location to catch up with friends over some Japanese fusion food. The music blasts loudly with popular upbeat tunes, making it a young crowd exclusive kind of location. A friend picked out the place for a mid-week dinner, and it was a full house at dinner time. Be warned that the summer heat has encouraged them to prop their front door open - opt for a table further into the store to avoid sharing your meal with flies. Service is a bit slow due to the staff being somewhat inattentive - don't wait or be shy and start waving those arms. Given the casual ambiance, I was willing to tolerate the shoddy service - though this certainly separates them from a higher rating. Just because they're young and hip doesn't mean they have to act like stereotypical uncaring young folk!

We ordered the corn kaki-age, mentaiko cream sauce udon, spicy octopus soup udon, and seafood stir fry udon. The corn kaki-age stood up to the reviews and tips, with its crunchy texture and sweet corn niblets. The texture contrast is interesting and the deep fried appetizer pairs well with Japanese mayonnaise. When it arrived I was uncertain, but a few bites in I was definitely interested. It's not something I would have every day, but definitely a dish I'll return to get again.

The udon dishes were fusion style that put traditional Japanese ingredients with western style flavour combinations. The spicy octopus udon in soup was interesting, unfortunately my palate doesn't handle much spice. The mentaiko cream sauce was a highlight - the dish comes looking like a classy Italian pasta, but once you dig in you notice all the tiny fish roe in the cream sauce that add depth to the flavour. The sauce clung onto every noodle and didn't feel too heavy. The seafood stir fry udon reminded me of a seafood linguini, where soy sauce replaced the tomato sauce. The seafood was flavourful and there were reasonable amounts of it on the dish, however I wasn't super enthusiastic about it. Nonetheless it was a safe dish I see myself ordering again if I'm feeling conservative with my meal.

There was a selection of sake by the bottle, though I was surprised to find bottles to be hovering around the 750mL volume. With a group of friends I would revisit for sure to try out more dishes, especially the tapas, and give the sake list a go."}
{"text":"A small restaurant just south of Yonge and Finch. Came here for a friend's birthday last year and back a second time now. This place is known for their udon and sake. I ordered the curry shrimp tempura udon, my partner the seafood udon and a fresh fried eggplant tapa. All the dishes were tasty. The only thing I would suggest is to provide larger mussels in the seafood and that's about it. Would come back again for the udon. They're so smooth and silky!"}
{"text":"I visited MeNami close to 4PM on a Sunday so there was no wait and we were able to get a seat by the window immediately. To share amongst two, we ordered the Kitsune udon, chicken karaage, and spicy salmon tartar. The udon was delicious and I loved the fried tofu which was soaked up in the flavourful soup base. The chicken karaage had a crispy, light batter - very tasty. The spicy salmon tartar, served with chips, had a pretty generous portion of salmon and we quite enjoyed this as well.

Overall, I had a great experience at MeNami and will be back for more udon and appetizers!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the neighbourhood! Great vibe, but the best part is the food.
Tsuke noodles and corn kakiage is the best combo on warmer days. The noodles have an amazing texture (not surprising since it is all made fresh on site), chewy and so flavourful. The corn kakiage is seriously the bomb. I wish they sold the honey butter dip in tubs to take home! The service is very attentive but not suffocating. This is my go to place! Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you're getting. A must in North York!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times with my first visit being the best one so far. I would actually say it is a bit closer to a 3.5 star though. 

Specializes in udon which is a favourite of mine however I wasn't as impressed in my last visit. The concept is great considering it's a change up from all the ramen places nearby. 

The restaurant does get busy and also quite noisy. It might be hard trying to find a table if you have a big group so check if you can make reservations. I find it very tough holding a conversation though but if you are here for some udon and drinks then the atmosphere is great for that.  Also has a tv with sports playing usually so another plus. The patio is also opened when it's warmer though not the best place to sit when it's especially windy. 

What I have tried: corn Kaki-age, oven roasted pork belly, seafood yaki udon, black seasame puree udon w. Beef, tsuke udon w. Shrimp tempura, tempura udon. 

Corn Kaki-age decent but there's not enough corn. I don't particularly love this dish cause I feel the batter is on the heavy side so I don't get much corn taste.

Oven roasted pork belly: although not a crazy fan of pork belly as it is too greasy for me. I really liked this dish. The pickled onion and spring mix helped to balance the flavours and grease.

Seafood Yaki-Udon: I think this is my favourite out of the ones I tried. Portion size is decent, flavours work well and good amount of seafood. Usually, I don't order Yaki-Udon but this was done so well, I would consider ordering it again.

Black seasame puree udon w. Beef: very interesting concept. I'm a huge fan of seasame so I was excited to see how the flavours worked. It's a bit thick but flavours werent too strong. I had this during my first visit and I don't recall it popping out to me as something I would order again. There wasn't a lot of beef either.

Salmon cream sauce udon: very true to it's name very creamy but nothing too special in my opinion. 

Tsuke udon w. Shrimp tempura: originally when I heard about menami, this was the dish I wanted to try. Unfortunately, only comes with one shrimp tempura. It is decent but again, it's not super special but overall still enjoyed it. 

Tempura udon: again, one shrimp tempura with two veggie tempura. You can add another one for $2. I had this in my most recent visit and probably because of it's recency, I feel like it was generally more of a disappointment compared to the other dishes. The dish is quite standard and I opted to try this because I've never had their soup udon before. The broth was not warm enough and by the time I was almost done, the broth was cold. Even though I tend to be a slow eater, I have had noodle soup at many other places and that never seemed to be a problem. 

I feel like they do better with their more interesting and fusion dishes so better bet is to try those. If you are a huge meater, you would be rather disappointed with the protein portions however the pork belly had a decent portion. 

I feel like I would still come back because there's no place that has udon as it's specialty but at the same time, it isn't the first place that comes to my mind when I want to dine now."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

I walked past Menami several times and I thought the door and sign looked so cool and decided to give it a try. We were very lucky that day. There was no line-up, however, all the tables have been seated and only the bar area was available. We asked the server and she said the wait time for dining area was 1 hour. I really like the interior design of the restaurant, very modern. 

-- Food and Drink --

We ordered 4 dishes in total:

1. Chicken Kara-age $6.50 (6 pieces of deep fried chicken thigh with shiso mayonnaise on the side); the chicken thighs were still very juicy after deep frying it. I liked how crust is not too oily. The shiso mayo makes the chicken less greasy and heavy. 

2. Corn Kaki-age $5 (5 pieces of deep fried corn niblets with honey butter mayonnaise on the side); This is my favorite dish here, very fun. I don't know how the corn didn't pop when they deep fried it. I like how the corn was very crunchy.

3. Black Sesame Puree Udon with Beef $15 (Udon cooked in black sesame puree sauce with beef, schichimi, green onion, red pepper thread and baby spinach on top); This is my least favorite dish. There was not a lot of beef in my dish. I found the dish too sweet. It taste similar to the Chinese black sesame sweet soup coated on the udon. 

4. Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon $12 (Udon cooked in cream sauce with mentaiko, green onion and spicy tomato oil on top). It taste quite similar to Japanese Carbonara pasta. I cannot taste any hint of spicy tomato oil. However, I like how the mentaiko popped in my mouth and it created a different experience. 

-- Overall --

I wasn't too happy that we were rushed to leave. With 1/4 of pasta left over (for both pasta dish), the server walked to us and asked if we were done. They had some interesting dishes here, but I would probably be back if they have more innovative dishes (at least after the hype)."}
{"text":"First off I'm not Japanese but I work in the area so I thought why not. We got the famous corn which is basically a corn fritter with a cream sauce and it was okay, I wouldn't say it was a must. Service was pretty good- I thought our food took a while to come considering the restaurant was basically empty but that was okay. My husband got the curry udon w/tempura shrimp and I got the creamy salmon udon. Not sure how traditional the above dishes are but they were amazinggg, the creamy salmon was a rich alfredo with salmon and crean onions and they curry udon had an interesting flavor, tempura was okay. The portion size was fairly good, udon was the perfect firmness. Other popular dishes are the baked udon. We got the thai ice tea which was good but holy cow it was $6.00! Next time I go I want to try the seafood hot pot

*If its your first time here: Get curry udon with shrimp as it is the most popular and safest to try"}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0

Service was quick and attentive, but the udon was just alright. Ordered the Spicy Pork Udon in Soup and the Black Sesame Udon with Beef. 

Texture of the udon was not consistent across the dishes - done right for the Black Sesame but over cooked for the Spicy Pork Udon in Soup. The meat itself was a bit over cooked. Also the soup base for the Spicy Pork Udon tasted a bit fabricated, similar to what you would expect from an instant noodle spicy soup base.

I'd say this place is overhyped."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing mind blowing. Just decent. 

But the service was terrible. I left 10% which I had never done before. The servers had a terrible attitude and seemed pissed that they had to do their job. Oh and I had to ask for everything. Like the menu, which the waitress brought over with an attitude. Paying for the bill was also unpleasant. No \"thank you\", \"how was the food\", no communication. She just brought the bill and the machine and watched me silently as I paid. They actually didn't even deserve the 10%. Should have left zero."}
{"text":"This place has a lovely atmosphere that's super classy and casual. The wait time is a bit long, but totally worth it. There's lots of paid street parking around to. We decided to just try a few sake drinks with our appetizer meal. We got 4 appetizers (tuna tartare, salmon tartare, torched saba and kara-ge). Favorite one was definitely the tuna! Would definitely come back to hang out at this lovely place!"}
{"text":"I just went there for Oven Baked Udon and the Nagasaki Udon. Both were very good. The shrimp, squid, and scallop had good, soft textures and weren't hard and tough. Oven baked udon was nice and creamy, and the soup udon had a tasty broth with a hint of spice. Udon texture was good too (oven baked one was slightly better than the soup one). The only down side was that the place was loud as hell. That's the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars.

Quality: 9/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 7.5/10. Overall: 8/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch on a weekday. They have lunch special (free salad or pop) which was nice. Ordered the chicken karaage first- came out hot and crispy. So tender... Mmmm. We also ordered the oven baked udon (very rich!) And the tonkatsu with curry (delicious!). I'd come back for the karaage!"}
{"text":"FOOD: 4/5 - this is certainly the place to go if you're a fan of udon! So many varieties like cold udon, served in soup, stir fried or served in sauce. I love their creative take on the udon. My favorite ones were the black sesame purée udon with beef and the Salmon in Cream sauce. Delicious! The portion is not huge but you could get fillers such as roasted pork belly (yummy!), karages and other tapas. 

SERVICE: 3.5/5 - They have a long wait on weekends and sometimes reservation could be full too. When I was there, our server accommodated us to a more comfortable table since we were at the bar. I thought it was nice of her to do that. Service could be slow at times because there are usually 2 staff members and the place is always packed.

ATMOSPHERE: 3.5/5 - Lively, modern, rustic chic. Definitely a nice place to hang out with friends.

OVERALL RATING: 4/5"}
{"text":"Cute little izakaya-esque place in North York. I really like the decor of this place. Really makes it feel like a young and happening place. The tables were a bit small and cramped but the service was alright. 

From the tapas menu we had the chicken Kara-age: I don't recommend this because it's not really what you would expect. It's more like a chicken meat ball with some spices and not fried chicken pieces. And it doesn't come with the usual mayo sauce which is the best part!! The corn kaki-age was a hit! The fried crispy sweet corn was a crunchy treat and with the mayo sauce tastes like cream corn with a great crunchy kick. The roasted pork belly was meh. I mean it tastes good because it's fatty and it has some spices on it but for the price it only comes with 7 pieces, it's just not worth it. 

I think most people come for the different variety of udon dishes they have here. I tried the curry udon with tempura shrimp, which I really liked. I think the udon in the curry sauce was a great combo. Dipping the crunchy tempura shrimp in the curry sauce was also delish! It also comes with a yam tempura, my fav! Although I thought the batter was a bit thick. 

Overall great atmosphere, great service. Come only if you like some udon fusion dishes. The tapas were okay but I think we ordered them to help fill our stomachs cause all the dishes were on the small side. Defly come back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very busy when I went on a weekday, and tables are so close together that people end up hitting the back of your chair every time they pass by. But besides the layout of the restaurant, the food was delicious. I ordered the Salmon Cream Sauce Udon. Very creamy and very flavourful. I would come back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"The place is so nice and staff is awesome! We we're curious about one of the alcohol on tap (because it looked like sake) so we asked about it. One of the servers (I believe it was the owners son) actually gave us two shots of the sake for free. Thats honestly such good customer service and he did not have to give us two whole shots. Thanks so much! We came back again today to watch the game and thanked him for it! Id recommend this place to anyone, the food is great and so are the prices and location. 

There is no wifi tho: ( but there is parking at the side street after 9pm and main street at 10pm!

Edit: we can't stop coming back here! One of the bartender was so nice enough to make us a drink off menu, it was really good, thanks!

EditEdit: the owner recognized us Cuz we come here so often so she gave us service. She's so sweet!! The squid is delicious, and it is on the menu so anyone can order it"}
{"text":"Menami is the new Korean-Japanese tapa in the Finch and Yonge neighbourhood. It's opened by the owner of Han Ba Tang at Sheppard and Yonge. 

It focuses on different types of udons, hotpots and small tapas. My friends and I ordered Korokke and Corn Karagge to start, they were both quite delightful. 

Our main courses to share were Shrimp tempura curry udon, Mentaiko cream udon and the Oden hotpot. Our favourite was probably the hotpot. It had various ingredients, really quite satisfying on a cold Toronto day. The udons were just okay, you can easily reproduce the samething at home, with the frozen udons from asian grocery stores.

We waited for 45min on a Friday night at 8:30pm. 

If we return, we likely will stick to the hotpots (other tables were ordering the seafood choice, which looked good!) and the tapas will go well with the beer :)

Friendly service, super nice owner!"}
{"text":"Casual feel with yummy food. Tried the corn kaki-age, oven baked udon and the yaki niku udon. The corn kaki-age was crispy and buttery, baked udon was creamy buttery and garlicky, but a little heavy so good for sharing and the yaki niku udon had a great broth. It wasn't too salty or watery which I usually find with most udon. I'm still drooling over the corn."}
{"text":"2 words. TUNA TATAKI. (Wasabi, Soy Sauce, Green Onion, Green Onion Oil, Seaweed ).  I do not like raw fish but recently I started to love seared tuna and at menami it is A-MAZINGGG.  Fresh and delicious and marinated just perfectly, it is complimented well with some seaweed underneath :) I would come back again to have this dish but order 2 to eat as just my main course!

For my actual main I had the sukiyaki (Beef, Napa, Green Onion, Enoki Mushroom, Shitake Mushroom, Oyster Mushroom, Harusame, Chrysanthemum ). It comes in a big pot over a portable gas top and is more than enough for 2 people. I eat A LOT and we had some leftovers!  You can order rice or udon on the side, but I think for small eaters you don't even need to add anything because there are some noodles part of it already.   I expected there to be more veggies than beef but the bowl was actually mostly beef, so this is great news for meat lovers.  The main complaint here is that the beef was super overcooked so it became quite tough, but I don't think anything can be done about this since the pot stays heated as you are eating it.  

Overall a cute casual spot!  They are known for their udon and there's tons of interesting choices on their menu.  I had udon on the side and it perfectly bouncy.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try their black sesame udon."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious udon soups. And an amazing place to grab some drinks. The setting and the selection is optimal."}
{"text":"Wow! This a new Japanese eatery that recently opened up by Yonge/Finch. I really enjoyed the effort that the cooks put into making the food both aesthetically pleasing and delicious! 

I would recommend the udon, tuna sashimi, and the karaage. Additionally, they have a wide selection of cocktails and sakes. I specifically enjoyed the yuzu sake, and I would recommend it to anyone who visits!

The service was great and the servers were always attentive to our needs and answered all our inquiries. I would definitely recommend coming here if you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"First time here with my friends and it was amazing.
We got the Nagasaki, oven baked, and and the udon with curry sauce and mashed potato on top (I forgot the name of it). We also got an appetizer to share, the corn kaki-age, and it was amazing! I wish we could have had more of that.
The Nagasaki udon was a soup based udon with a little bit of spice, with assorted seafood.
The oven baked udon is basically a loaded mashed potatoes but substitute the mashed potato with udon. It gets very heavy about half way through.
The curry mashed potato udon was definitely my favourite one out of the three. The curry was amazing, and mixed with the mashed potato was just mind blowing. It became a sweet whipped curry type of sauce. I was debating whether to get the Nagasaki (because a fellow yelper highly recommended it) and the mashed potato one (since curry and mashed potatoes are two of my favourite foods) and I definitely regretted not getting the mashed potato udon.
If I ever go back I would definitely get the mashed potato one, and I recommend everyone to try that one.
The wait was about 20 minutes on a Saturday night, which isn't bad at all for such a popular restaurant.
We also each got a cocktail, the guns and roses, yuzu cocktail and a new cocktail they just introduced that wasn't on the menu. All three were amazing and looked absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an awesome vibe in the Yonge and Finch area. They are known for their udon, and also has a very nice sake bar. I came on a weekday evening around 630; the restaurant was still pretty empty at that point, so we were seated right away. By the time we left around 8, the restaurant was getting pretty busy and packed. There's metered street parking outside the restaurant on Yonge and Holmes (the restaurant is located in the corner of Yonge and Holmes).

To start, we ordered the corn kaki-age, as this was highly recommended by a friend. It was sooooo good. It was perfectly fried with just the right amount of batter, and not oily at all. But the best part of this dish is the honey butter mayonnaise that it is paired with. So yum! However, I personally found this dish a bit overpriced. It was $5 for 5 small corn fritters. So each piece is $1, and it really is just corn, batter, and mayo for the sauce. 

For the udon, my husband and I tried the Original Kama Udon and the Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon. The udon noodles for both were very good, perfect texture and chewiness. The Original Kama Udon was way too salty though, and I had to drink a lot of tea to subdue the saltiness. The Mentaiko Cream Sauce udon was amazing. The cream sauce was soooo good, I would definitely come back to this restaurant just for this udon!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Udon!!! I'm very happy to find a restaurant specialized in making Udon. And it's in uptown instead of downtown lol 

Located on Yonge st close to Finch, MeNami is on the corner of Holmes Ave with a quite unique door that you will never miss. I made a reservation three days before for six people. We've been given to a nice window view seat,Lucky:)

The appetizers taste good and the price is ok in terms of the portion. The Corn Kaki-age is a must try. I like the crunchy deep fried corn with their sweet mayo. Tako Wasa is a very summer dish with a very refreshing wasabi flavour. I'll say if more wasabi will be even better. Chicken Kara-age is average. Spicy salmon is my least favourite. The texture of the salmon is not bad but the spicy flavour kind of overcomes the fish taste itself.

Their Udon is awwwwewsome!!! Different from frozen udon, the texture of the fresh made udon is chewy and firm. Nice and perfect!My order is Curry Udon with Shrimp Tempura. I like the strong taste of Japanese curry base, with freshly deep fried shrimp. Dipping the tempura into the curry taste even better. Their Spicy Cold Udon is definitely perfect for summer time. Not that spicy but quite refreshing flavour is very appetizing.

Right, you are able to find some popular Japanese beer like Asahi. Their House Sake is not bad."}
{"text":"Omg !! Best best best !!! Trust me, and I'm really picky. I'd give the service and the food 5 stars."}
{"text":"After hearing my brother rave about it, I finally agreed to try this place. Since I was not the one who paid (lol), I don't believe I can give an accurate review on whether this place was worth the dent in my brother's wallet. However, I do believe that their selection of food, quality of food, and service is deserving of 4 stars. 
I've been here about 3 times. My brother is regular here therefore, he knew what to order as soon as we sat down. 
At first glance, this place is very eye catching when you're driving on Yonge Street. After opening the huge metal doors (you can't miss them!), we were greeted. The hostess first said that we would have to wait a bit because of the number of reservations (keep in mind this is a small place as well). Just being hungry, we settled for bar seats. Under the counter, there were coat hooks so no need to be afraid of your coats falling off the stools and all of the place. 
On this visit, we ordered corn kaki-age ($5), chicken kara-age ($6.5), spicy seafood soup ($23), and seafood yaki udon ($13) (Note: my brother ordered everything so I don't remember the exact names of the dishes). 
One thing I did notice different from my previous visits was how the chicken kara-age (basically fried chicken) was made. There was a different texture and outer layer. Still crispy but I think there was more of a \"crunch\" when I first had it. It also looked slightly undercooked but the waitress said that it was just because it was dark meat. Also, I'm still alive so I guess she was right! 
Everything was really delicious and sitting at the bar gives you an insight on how the chefs prepared the meals. It was clean, efficient, and were passionate about what they were doing, especially the tapas chef. 
My brother and his friend also ordered two cocktails - one was the sailor moon and the other was a spiked thai iced tea. He said MeNami probably has one of the best unique asian-inspired cocktails in Toronto and since I was not able to try them and based on his restaurant loyalty, I'm going to have to take his word for it. 
I would come back but probably just share a udon and tapa next time. Wonderful service and food!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite after some much needed soup after a Crazy Night of Booze filled Karoke. Definitely needed something soupy and ran into this place with my trusty Yelp app. The decor and set up of this restaurant is definitely a must see and a lot better than the previous 3 restaurants that used to be here. They have a wide variety of Sake, Soju, and any other liqour your heart desires. I would have tried 2 or 3 sakes but I was waaayy to hungover to keep drinking but hey..thats the way to cure a hangover right? Haha!

Anyways the service was great and the food was even better. I like open concept kitchen and you can see the chefs cooking right in front you. I guess they cannot practice the \"5 second rule\" here...haha! I ordered the beef udon and it was delicious. The protein to carb ratio a.k.a. meat to noodle ratio was perfect and I left feeling satisfied. We also ordered the beef sashimi and tuna tataki, pork udon, and curry udon and all was delicious.

I will definitely be coming back for some more booze and udon next time."}
{"text":"Living in the area, I'm always dragging my boyfriend to try out the latest restaurant! I was really drawn by the unique decor of MeNami and being a noodles fan, I was super excited to try this place! I had high hopes for this place because of the good reviews and being associated with Han Ba Tang (which I love). Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the experience. The portions was just okay but the toppings were quite minimal for the price that they were charging. I was definitely expecting better value. The soup broth flavour was good, but nothing impressive or memorable. I didn't feel that much of a difference between the noodles at MeNami then the frozen udon noodles I get from the supermarket. The service was mediocre as well. I don't think I would be returning given the many noodles options in the Yonge and Finch area!"}
{"text":"Not a place to go if you only have an hour for lunch! Their service was slow and we felt like we had to rush our eating just to get back to the office on time.

We were placed right by the washroom and they had left the door open, so the entire time we were there, I could smell the washroom stench! How unappetizing...

I had ordered the Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon ($13) and I found the portions just enough for me. The Udon texture was good, but the cream sauce was quite heavy and there wasn't a lot of fish eggs, which was a disappointment considering the price.

My coworker ordered the Seafood Yaki Udon ($13) and he found there to be too much dried bonito on it. He said the fish-y taste over powered the seafood taste and he too was not entirely impressed with his dish.

Another coworker ordered a smoke salmon appetizer ($10). That actually looked quite good and she really enjoyed it.

It's unfortunate for these flaws. I really wanted to like this place!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this spot by a friend, and looking at all the photos the udon dishes definitely look nice. Visited on a Sunday at 12:30 pm - I had made a reservation for 3 in case but it was not actually that busy during lunch hours (around half to 3/4 full our entire visit). There is paid parking along Yonge and the side streets, but I ended up parking at Finch Station (free on weekends) and walked less that 5 mins. 

As for food, ordered the Roasted Pork Belly to share along with an Oven Baked Udon for myself. The pork belly came with onions and vegetables, and tasted nice - not too chewy/fatty and the ending taste with the cumin was good but a bit too much in my opinion. The oven baked udon looked like a lot of cheese, but the taste was not heavy at all. Had a decent mix of shrimps, scallops (a bit chewy), and bacon. The udon noodles were a good size and tasted decent for the most part.  

Value wise it was not too bad - $11 for the pork belly (we split it across 3) and $14 for the udon. If anything I wish the portion was a bit bigger (afterwards I didn't feel hungry, but not particularly full either). Service was alright, although I found it weird that they had run out of the beef sashimi appetizer despite it being the lunch hour. It's alright, and I'll keep this in mind if I am in the area."}
{"text":"So I was so excited to try this place out.. 

The music was great . Theres one star 
The corn snack was also good, another star 
And the baked udon was AMAZING , loved it, DO ORDER 

However . 
The hot sake was nasty. 
The raw octopus, never again 
The service :/ they never came to the table to check up, but they would check on every other table that had asians sitting . Thats not cool 
& definitely not appreciated, so we left only a 5% tip & a lady came right away to ask if everything was okay as soon as we only tipped 5%. No. 
& to top things off, someone ripped a big one near us, worst fart ive smelt in my life, immediately got up and ran out, as i gagged 5 times. What in the world... 

Not going back. Thank you for the udon though"}
{"text":"Came here one gloomy afternoon and ordered some udon. Really like it and it wasn't even busy. Love the ambience, service was exceptional, food was amazing.  Had the black sesame udon and curry udon. Both were great and tasty. But the curry udon was really good. Definitely recommend this dish if you love Japanese curry. Also ordered an appetizer - spicy salmon tartare. Love it. I'm a seafood lover so I love anything with fish. Overall a great experience. I will come back to try the meat dishes since I'm no longer pescatarian!"}
{"text":"MeNaMi was my first time experiencing upscale udon. Up until now, my experience with udon was always met, mainly because I was so used to having it at home all the time that it wasn't special. I also really loved Manpuku downtown and wondered, what makes MeNaMi so special? Well, I found out. MeNaMi is udon, but embellished and dangerously delicious (quite satisfying and filling) with unique flavour combinations such as tex mex cheese (think Mac and cheese but on udon... Yes.). Came here with three other girl friends and we ordered 3 udon bowls to share which was a good choice because the portions were big and sufficient for sharing. The tapa was fantastic for sharing (we got the smoked salmon tartare). I also got a drink which was well mixed, I have a friend who swears their drinks are the best! From my one time experience, it was good :) 

In terms of the service, ambience, overall experience... Loved it. They were friendly, accommodating and patient. The playlist was BOMB (I approve of whoever manages the music here). The inside of the restaurant is just as appealing as the exterior with an upscale bar style interior. The dim lighting definitely sets a nice mood for a girls night out or a date night."}
{"text":"Come here if you want udon. I am no expert on udon but it is pretty damn good. 

I am a big fan of their udon that has a crazy amount of cheese on it, making it like mac and cheese, except it's udon and cheese. It definitely appeals to the North American palate. 

Nothing else really impressed me but I come back for the udon."}
{"text":"I tried Mentaiko cream udon ($12) and Shrimp tempura curry udon ($11) -they were decent. There werent as much mentaiko as expected and wasn't as salty. So the flavour was quite blend. And as there weren't any toppings other than literally mentaiko, and just shrimp tempura and curry sauce for Curry udon, you may get sick of the flavour on half way thru the dish. Wish there were other things to chew on rather than just the soft noodles.  However if you like simple minimal dish, it's a good choice!  For me tho, I will try something else.
I also tried corn karaage $5 -this I Loved. I like corns so it was good crispness and sweetness. Would order again!
Atmosphere was good. Service ok."}
{"text":"The Oven Baked Udon contained shrimp, scallop, bacon, green pepper, white onion, and Tex Mex.  This one was extremely cheesy with the Tex Mex on top and full of cream sauce as well.  Since it was oven baked, the surface of the udon when it arrived was a beautiful golden yellow colour from the oven baked cheese.  It smelled amazing too!

There were a lot more shrimps in this than scallops and I liked the bacon slices that were hidden within this creamy udon dish as well.  If you love cheese, you will love this udon dish!  Just like the first dish, I really enjoyed the texture of the udon and its chewiness."}
{"text":"I first learned of Menami a few months ago when I was browsing a database of newly opened restaurants in Toronto. I found their website to be very appealing. They had a playable video of the owner describing the establishment on the home page, the website was very user friendly and the pictures complimented the colour scheme of the web pages well. Menami is also known to have a door that sticks out. Turquoise in colour and grand in size (double doors) with a flashy lit-up sign on top, it's hard to miss.  Then, once you're inside your eyes will start feasting on the trendy decor. Their ceiling lights, wall decor, stools, and other knick knacks were made with two aesthetics combined together: nature and industrialism. Think of steampunk marrying mori-kei. 

Location-wise, this is about a two minute walk from Finch Station, so this would be a good place to get some drinks after work if you're a commuter. 

Their specialty is udon. I chose the seafood udon, which came as a pleasantly portioned dish filled with an above average amount of toppings. The broth was lighter than what I'm used to, which is often a meat-based or dashi-based broth with heavy notes of soy sauce and mirin (think of niku udon).  At Menami, their seafood udon was light, yet very flavourful. I would almost say it tasted healthy, which is often something that is questionable when drinking soups at a restaurant. Nonetheless, I was instantly obsessed with the broth and thoroughly enjoyed drinking every last drop. I usually leave most of the soup when I'm out, mind you.  The udon noodles had a good girth to them to boot, so I will definitely becoming back! 

This place is great for dates or small groups of friends.  The green-blue lighting and decor make this a great spot for an intimate conversation over drinks and udon."}
{"text":"Visited Dec 19, 2016 for dinner for 4

One of the best restaurants in the Yonge/Finch area. This was a really cold night, they had a heater that helped a bit. Our server Amy took the time to explain the menu which was great. Definitely ask questions so you know what you're ordering as Menami has some very unique dishes. 

Pros
Oven baked udon - Very interesting with baked cheese, not for the lactose intolerant. $15 is a bit pricy. 
Spicy pork udon - Tasted great, flavourful broth. 
Curry udon with shrimp tempura - Just a bit of spicyness, not too much. 
Torched saba was also good, mainly because it's torched. I asked if they torched the fish at the table but they don't unfortunately. 

Cons
A bit tough to find parking as it was busy and cold.
Can get a bit loud with people talking and the music. 


Protip -Fresh fried okra - The best dish that I've had here, must try! 

Damage $58 (tax included)"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. The Oven Baked Udon was like an Asian dish colliding with an Italian dish. Udon noodles with Alfredo sauce, bacon and shrimp with lots of cheddar cheese; interesting bit heavy. The chicken karagi was delicious but I wish they would make the pieces smaller; hard to maneuver into my mouth without choking on the fried bits."}
{"text":"3.5* Went here to celebrate a birthday and they were able to accommodate a large party of 15 with a baby. The food was good. We ordered the yaki niku udon, chicken kara-age,  and spicy salmon tar tar. The udon broth was tasty but the add ins were few and far between. The chicken kara-age was good,  well fried and good chunks of chicken. The spicy salmon tar tar was disappointing. Wasn't spicy and little for what you pay for. Will probably be come back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"** Note: Late review as I ate this during November, and only applies to take out option.

As it is finals season, I opted out to visit MeNami (for the first time) in person and decided to stay back to finish up school work instead. However, my friends offered to do takeout for me, which was super sweet and I'm so thankful for that!

I originally wanted to try their Oven Baked Udon, but that wasn't available for takeout since it was in a special baked plate. I ended up with the Seafood Yaki Udon instead.

The Seafood Yaki Udon consisted of mussels, squid, shrimp, onion, mayonnaise and sweet soy sauce, sprinkled with nori and bonito flakes on top. They gave about 5 pieces of mussel, a ton of squid and a couple of small shrimp (not the big pieces).

For take-out, the bowl was different as compared to some take out I've seen. It replicates a ramen bowl (so the bottom is smaller, the top is wider).

The Seafood Yaki Udon was really flavourful, and I mixed the noodles around before eating as all the sauce was at the bottom. I really enjoyed it, and they gave a lot of squids... This dish made me regret not going to visit MeNami in person. I give is a 7.5/10 due to the mixture of flavours and they were generous with the seafood.

Because it was taken out, I didn't manage to experience the service or their appetisers. I've heard good things about their appetisers and hope to visit MeNami for myself to try it."}
{"text":"They've got fried udon, udon in hot or cold soup, creamy udon--you name it! They've also got a number of Japanese tapas and rice bowls to choose from, but none of them truly stood out. 

The highlight of their upon dishes is the udon itself--nice and chewy. The seafood yaki udon was creamy, but I wish they were more generous with their seafood. Their were only a few small pieces of shrimp, mussels and squid. I couldn't even tell you how the seafood itself tasted.

I enjoyed the chicken karaage udon, which was in a cool broth. It was great for a scorching Toronto afternoon. There was a generous amount of chicken, but the batter was too light and not crispy enough, and it became a soggy mess after sitting in the broth. 

We started with the corn fritters, which were crispy and tasted decent. The fritter balls were kernels of corn held together by batter and deep fried. I half expected the corn to be incorporated into the batter, so you get that crispy on the outside and soft on the inside fritters goodness, but I that's just me. 

All in all, my meal was satisfying but not enough to make me return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after hearing great reviews! Located just a block south of Yonge and Finch, this used to be a sushi restaurant that changed owners at least two times and I think this time, Menami will stay for good because it's just that amazing! This is more of a Japanese tapas restaurant serving a variety of unique dishes but specializing in their udon. Of course, I had to try their udon so I ordered the Curry Udon with Tempura. My boyfriend and his brother orders the udon noodle soups and they all tasted delicious. The udon noodles were fresh and silky but I was more impressed with the flavour of my Japanese curry dish. It was fragrant and left me wanting for more! I also tried their beef tataki, tuna albacore and raw octopus all of which were fresh and beautifully presented.

The ambience is hip and relaxing with hip hop music playing in the background. I loved the open concept kitchen and funky design of their bar. It was only a weekend afternoon lunch and it was pretty busy so make sure you make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner today, and it was practically empty with two other tables. This time around, I ordered the oven baked udon because 1) I love cheese and 2) I also love cream sauce. And my bf ordered the original kama udon. My oven baked udon turned out to be very creamy with a lot of sauce, and it had a few pieces of shrimp, one scallop and bits of bacon. 

I found the service to be very attentive..because well there weren't a lot of people to begin with. But overall, great place for udon!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy but I made reservations so we were seated right away. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and unique decor. I really enjoyed the food and service. 

Corn Kaki-age ($5) - this was amazing. We got one order to share among three people. It was so crispy and paired well with the honey butter mayo. We enjoyed it so much that we ordered a second serving. 

The Original Tsuke Udon ($7.95) - this dish was alright. Granted that it is the original flavour, I was still expecting something delicious. The udon was perfectly cooked, but the dipping sauce was just okay. Nothing special, I wouldn't get it again.

Curry Udon with Shrimp Tempura ($11) - I really enjoyed this dish. Perfectly cooked udon paired with a tasty mild curry sauce. The waitress recommended for the tempura to be dipped in the sauce which actually turned out to be delicious. 

Black Sesame Puree Udon with Beef ($15) - I was most looking forward to this. Black sesame sauce with udon, spinach and beef is such a unique combination but it really works. The flavour is sweeter than I usually care for but I didn't mind because it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"With all of the ramen places in the area, it is great to have a really good udon place as an option.  The food is really good and the staff are very friendly.  The waitress recommended that I try the corn kakiage and I was really glad I took her recommendation."}
{"text":"This place is overhyped. While the corn kakiage was pretty good, the udon they are known for falls short. I got the kama udon and it was super duper salty, and barely any broth. The sushi shop I usually go to has better udon. Service is meh."}
{"text":"Located south of Yonge & Finch at Yonge & Holmes, MeNami's bright lights signs and their huge, green door is hard to miss. Udon and drinks are the key things to get at MeNami. 

Food ****
I ordered the cheese udon and chicken karagee. Udon was creamy and delicious while the chicken was crispy and yummy. Seems like portion depends on which udon dish you get. My cheese udon had big portions while my friend's salmon udon dish seemed to be a bit small (especially the piece of salmon)

Service ***
Service is generally decent and friendly. Sometimes you need to flag a waiter down but not that often. Although during busy hours, service is usually difficult to obtain. 

Ambiance ****
Place has a rustic but cozy feel with a half open kitchen and a patio for the summer. Music in general fits the vibe. Chairs are a bit hard but in general it's a fun place to go for a date or hanging out with some friends who are in the mood for udon and drinks

Tips/Closing comments
- Patio is always amazing, try it out if the weather permits, you can people watch a lot
- Order an udon dish"}
{"text":"Came here on  a quiet tuesday afternoon with two friends of mine. We ordered 3 different types of udon, one of the cold udons with chicken thigh tempura, seafood udon and I got the curry udon (sorry I don't remember the names). We also got the fried corn as well as the chicken kara-age (I think?). Everything came out quickly and was very flavourful and reasonably priced. The interior of the restaurant is also very clean and cute. Our server was also quite nice and helpful while ordering. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I don't even know how to spell their name and I can't go back and forth on this app thing haha menami is autosaved on my phone so I'll just hope that it's correct. 

Went there for a girls night. We were lured in by the Sailor moon Goes Wild drink. We came around 6ish on Saturday and were asked if we had reservations. We were lucky bc there were empty tables with reservations for 8pm. We ordered our drinks and some apps.

We tried the deep fried shrimp, the corn thing and some sort of potato thing. I liked everything except the corn thing bc I prefer juicy corn nibblets over dryish corn blobs. It was definitely an interesting concept though.

The drink itself was definitely worth coming for. I would come again for a girls night. I would probably not eat there again just because there are so many other options along yonge.

It was a little loud for chatting, and my friend who used the bathroom told me it wasn't clean loll soooo I suppose those are my only negatives regarding the establishment itself. 

There were many waitstaff in ratio to the tables, so I thought that was nice. Our waitress was very patient when it came to splitting the bill...we were 5 and wanted to split the food 4ways, only bc my friend didn't eat and then we wanted to put 2 of the 4 bills on 1 bill, but there were 5 drinks. It seemed difficult for her so we were thankful that she did that for us. 

Overall an okay place to come try!"}
{"text":"They really need to hire more people, waiting ages for everything. Food is not that great, so salty. My son can even cook better udon than what I hv ordered. 

Never go back."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and we came here to celebrate because we used to always go to the restaurants that used to exist at this location. We had a great time!
Interior design is beautiful! I would recommend making efforts to make it s bit cozier for the winter but otherwise it's gorgeous. Music was AMAZING.
The food options are interesting and all tasted great (from what we had). We shared the curry shrimp tempura dish and the spicy seafood soup bowl for two. It was huge! It came with a mini stove for our table and every bit of soup tasted fresh. Very delicious. All udon noodles are made in house and fresh.
They had a bunch of great beers on tap as well as Korean drinks and delicious cocktails. 
Kevin the head chef came up to us and offered a complimentary dessert and it was amazing. Friend sweet corn cakes and honey butter dipping sauce was delicious! 

Overall we had a great time. Food service and music were all amazing, and overall atmosphere was great. Things I would recommend looking into to improve are menu options but Kevin the head chef even specifically told us he was always working on expanding the menu so it's no concern.

Will definitely be back and will recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my friend. It is like a bar, but serve with good food. There are many options of the drink. We ordered a dish of tuna tataki, very good~ Best place for chatting and dating ~"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while wandering with my friend trying to pick a place for lunch. Was a pleasant surprise! Definitely will go back for the corn kaki-age and seafood udon."}
{"text":"I love the front decor of this place! Not something I would expect to see in the Yonge and Finch area (looks like it belongs on Queen Street W downtown). There are two big front doors and a bright, flashy MeNami sign above them. The interior is also super cute! The lights, chairs, bar area, and wallpaper give the place an overall chill vibe, where you can have a nice meal while catching up with a friend. I couldn't help but snap a few pictures upon entering.

My friend and I shared the corn kaki-age to start. It came with 5 pieces of deep fried corn that you could dip into honey butter mayonnaise. There was surprisingly a strong sweet corn taste and it paired extremely well with the mayo. We even double, triple, or even quadruple-dipped the corn into the mayo because it tasted that good! 

I rarely ever go to restaurants to eat udon, so I was a bit hesitant to try MeNami at first. But after having a taste of the first strand of udon, I could tell right away that it was very different from the frozen ones in supermarkets. The noodles were firm, yet chewy- cooked to perfection (al dente).

He ordered the black sesame puree udon with beef, which tasted exactly like the Chinese black sesame soup dessert! It had a tinge of sweetness to it.

I got the salmon cream sauce udon. There was one big piece of salmon, which wasn't anything spectacular in terms of taste. The cream sauce was delicious though, and surprisingly not too heavy.

Overall, the service was great; my friend and I sat there for a good 3 hours just chatting, and the server kept refilling our tea, without rushing us to leave. I do wish that the portions were a bit bigger, though!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and I will say this... This place is solid. The entrance was this really big older style wooden door (I don't have much art sense, please bear with me). However, I was the noob and saw the \"normal\" door and tried to pull it open. Of course, being the noob the door was locked. So I went through the REAL doors... silly me. Anyhow, once I got in this place is pretty cool looking on the inside. They got these front grille from vintage cars as decor. I love the open concept kitchen too. As an added distraction for me, they got 2 big TVs tuned to any games on. 

On to the menu... It's interesting how they use these clipboards and not like traditional menus. And thanks to other Yelpers, I can see what are the recommendations. 

On to the food: 

Corn kaki-age is a 5/5, should of gotten more. This reminded me of fritters with corn. Not too sweet. Must dip into the sauce.

Okonomiyaki is a 3.5/5, lots of filling within the pancake. However, the sauce gotten a bit sweet? 

Black sesame sauce beef udon is a 3.5/5, the reason being the sauce gotten too thick. I like the udon's texture and the beef. 

Spicy pork udon is a 4/5, quite spicy after mixing up the sauce/soup. 

Atmosphere is a 5/5 for sure. I love the fact they got decent music, but not too loud and the mood is great for chat. From a guy's point of view, bring a girl will be good. 

Service is a 5/5 for sure. The staff looked after us very nicely. Great attitude and all. 

Overall experience is definitely a 4/5 for sure. Will I come back? Yeah! I want more corn kaki-age! Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Originally I was going to give 3 stars because of the service but when I had their mind blowing delicious udon, it redeemed a star. When I arrived around 8pm on a Friday it was quite busy. I put my name and cell phone # on a waiting list to be called. only two people were ahead of me. I went a couple stores down to enjoy a bubble tea while waiting, after I had finished I went back to check on the wait list status. I asked the girl why my name was crossed out. She gave me a dumbfounded look and a look of recognition crossed her face as she said \"oh, sorry, I accidentally seated another girl because I thought she was you\"
This was upsetting since my sister and I were running on a schedule.
Once we were finally seated, we ordered the mentaiko cream sauce udon and oven baked udon. I love creamy sauces and cheese is my life. 

The mentaiko bowl reminded me of an Alfredo fettuccine while the oven baked reminded my sister of Mac and cheese.
I love udon, and when I learned it is made at menami I was quite pleased. Their udon was the perfect combination of firm/chewy/soft and happiness.
The price wasn't bad for two, including the corn appetizer (I love corn) and a matcha sake drink.

Service: Almost all of the servers look like they don't know how to work as one, inattentive, I asked for water 3 times, they would look straight at me as I'm trying to flag one down but walk the other way. Bluntness at its best.

TLDR; Udon was mouthgasmic. Servers need more training."}
{"text":"I only came here once for dinner and then the other times I came during lunch. I would definitely come here for lunch only just because the restaurant is quite small and it gets crowded at night. Every time I come the service has been really good (also it wasn't busy both times I went for lunch). The quality of the food is always consistent. I love the mentaiko cream sauce udon, it can get really filling and the corn kaki age."}
{"text":"Amazing udon place with stylish interior design (including the washroom). Ordered a potato cream udon. The cream on top looks great in photo but also looks potentially heavy. In actuality tho, I downed the entire bowl without pause. The pure-tasting potato cream coats the noodles giving them a smooth texture, as well as adding to the curry broth a hint of sweetness. The price is pretty much the same as any other Raman/noodle restaurants, but the atmosphere here is hard to find anywhere else. Definitely a must-go in Toronto."}
{"text":"To start, staff is friendly and willing to help you without hesitation: from adding a menu item to your meal to informing you whats the best way to enjoy your meal to changing tables, the staff is right on their heels to help.

App: my favourite is the corn kaki-age, deep fried corn accompanied by a rich and creamy honey butter sauce. It really cant go wrong. I would also recommend the grilled pork belly. They use a wide array of spices that pairs well with the pork. The salad and onions that come with the dish adds extra texture and balances the flavours of the spices.

Entree: first off, their udon is well cooked in my opinion. If feeling for something refreshing, go for their cold noodles. If looking for something creamy, the salmon roe cream udon or the seafood baked udon is a good choice. I must warn you though, even if there's nice jumbo shrimp and scallops in the bake, the dish can get very heavy. The spicy pork stew is pretty good as well; a good kick to your throat but still manageable. 

A con to me: their braised short ribs for two is a bit pricey, but the dish itself is quite nice. 

Overall, great place to go!"}
{"text":"Tapas here might be the thing to do, we enjoyed the corn fritters and chicken karage the most. House-brewed sake was good too ;) We sat at the bar and watched the other tapas go out and they looked yummy. I had the salmon udon which is essentially a watery Alfredo udon with nicely cooked piece of salmon. Udon noodle were good and the quality of the fish tipped it into an Asian dish , I would have it again even though it's an odd combo . Much better than anything you get at the Olive Garden and such! SO order spicy pork udon and he did not like it at all, as it was overpowered by too many raw onions on top. I had a taste of the broth after the offending onions were cleared, it was good but not worth ordering. Will go back to try other items would be great to go for drinks and tapas or when you want good salmon udon alfredo;)"}
{"text":"A close friend of ours suggested to try MeNami.  She lives close to this restaurant and she said that it was very good. So we made a reservation to see what the buzz was all about. We got a reservation for the time and date we wanted.  Think this place is not as busy and bustling as before.  

Their paper menu looked like a few hundred people touched it with their greasy paws.  Yuck!! Puhleese!!! Not a very savoury sight.  Time to go to Staples and print some new menus. 

After this sore sight, it went downhill from there.  The food is ok but the price is not.  Found it pricey for what you get.  I had an Udon dish and it was not hot at all.  Seems like it was sitting on the counter for some time. The only saving grace was their Okra appetizer.  This was delicious.  The rest.....mmegghhhh....I can do without.  Don't remember what the rest of us ate, but it's not important.  

The tables were also very close to each other and it's uncomfortable to have a good conversation without the next table partaking in the gossips. 

I gave it a three star because it was a recommendation from a friend.  Otherwise, it was a two star review. 

Next....There are many more restaurants in Toronto to visit."}
{"text":"One of my favourite food places on Yonge. Their signature udon is really good and their cocktail menu is a must-try. Atmosphere is good inside but it could get pretty packed in the evening so it is best to make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"I've been to Menami a few times and my ultimate favourites of this place are the Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon and the Corn Kaki-Age.  
But I'm not here to talk about that.  I'm here to talk about their grapefruit shochu drink, which for the life of me, I can't remember the name of.  Anyways, they advertised this drink of being fresh grapefruit in an alcoholic beverage.  What I didn't know was that the grapefruit was really fresh, like still in its skin fresh.  They basically gave me half a grapefruit and a manual juicer and expected me to basically make my own drink.  I get that this is a gimick and they're trying to make this drink into an experience, but I don't want to juice my own grapefruit.
I didn't pay 8 dollars to juice my own fruit.
I was not impressed."}
{"text":"After seeing Business Insider's video on FB, I caved and gave this place a try. I got the potato curry udon noodles and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The price was fair ($13) considering the small social media hype. It was still on the heavier side considering the cream aspect, but the potato cream, mixed with udon was really good! The curry wasn't overpowering and the udon gave a good chewy and light balance to the heaviness of the cream. 

My friend and I came on a Friday evening and the crowd wasn't that bad. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying out another dish!"}
{"text":"When i came to this store. I had high expectations as it was much hyped and had a lot of good reviews. My first impression coming in was good as the restaurant looked good atmosphere was nice and it was very crowded. The service was actually pretty good. However that was not enough to save the terrible excuse they had for udon. I ordered a tempura udon soup. And my gf ordered a kitsune udon. Needless to say they had failed on many levels. Th udon soup had come out sour. Because the cook made one of the most basic mistakes. As in cooking the Udon in your soup base when its not fresh udon
 . This made the dashi soup extra sour. Any chef knows to cook the udon beforehand if its instant cheap udon, which is what they used. Another mistake was they dunked the tempura into the soup so all the breading fell apart by the time i got it. The udon texture was from obviously not fresh but instant udons you buy at supermarkets and not the good kind either where its fresh and you have to freeze it, but the kind that has so many perservatives you can leave out there. The fact that they screwed up the most basic udon in an udon place is really inexcusable and they earned the 1 star rating. Definitely dont come here for udon. As they dont event grasp the concept of how to cook basic udon"}
{"text":"Affordable, casual, and tasty. MeNami has tasteful decor, a clean menu, but isn't particularly special. I had an unfortunate experience with the service, but the food as alright.

Our server was a Caucasian lady who seemed extremely anxious and distraught. She arrived at our table to ask if we were ready to order, and then sped away after we told her we weren't ready. It took a while to get her attention after that, and she appeared to be extremely stressed and unhappy. There were two servers on the floor, and it's not an overly large restaurant, so I was a little perplexed that she was so stressed. We didn't get a single smile or cheerful remark which irked me a little. Sure, she's busy and/or new to the job. But the job of the waiter is to make the customer feel welcome... which was not accomplished. Moving on to the food... 

We ordered the corn kaki-age, which was delicious. Deep fried corn clusters that had good texture and just the right amount of crunch. Chicken Karaage was next, and I enjoyed the fried chicken. Juicy, hot, and not too much batter. A good go-to appetizer.

Kama Udon - Just your basic Kitsune Udon with two fish cakes. Not much to say here. The broth was alright but not spectacular. 

Spicy Pork Udon - More like a kimchi udon with pork. Average, but the fact that the kimchi taste gets old and tiring after a million bites is a downside. Not much variety to this dish."}
{"text":"Still a very solid option.

I typically come during lunch hours, so it's not crowded or rowdy. The service is still quick and efficient. My usual order now is the udon with salmon and cream sauce. The salmon is really tender, like a sous-vide type of thing. It's kind of a mild flavor that works well with the cream. I do like it better than the mentaiko cream udon. I still think the cream sauce is really great.

I'm not as enamored with the corn kaki-age - the texture's been funny the last few times I've ordered them, almost like the ratio of corn to batter is off. I still really enjoy the texture of the udon, and I still think the prices are high for the tapas. Overall, I'm into it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: This place is a busy and happening restaurant. This is owned by the same owner/lady as Han Ba Tang ( I remember because she is this nice, middle-aged, Korean lady that was also there to serve us when Han baTang first opened.. and then here she is again here when I came!!) The tables are scattered all over the restaurant (can seat 2's, 4's or 
larger table of 6), but there is no private rooms or secluded dining areas. 

Reservation: I definitely will recommend calling ahead to book. 

Food: Yay -- here comes the fun part!! This is a 'fusion\" pasta/udon place! I totally dig iT!
It has my fav style of noodle --- CHEWY UDON, but it also combines different unique \"CREAM\" sauce to give it a similar PASTA type of eating way to enjoy your udon. 
I definitely will suggest to order CREAMY sauce instead of their regular soup udon will not be as special as their different style and flavours of UDON sauce available. 

Firstly, please also order the CORN kaki-age. It is battered corn but so YUMMY and surprisingly very addictive. Too bad I had to share that dish with others at the table!! =( 
ALSO, ORDER the THAI ICE TEA! this is one of the STRONGEST thai ice tea that I have ever had in Toronto. It had such GREAT, bold flavours!!! and this is not even a THAI restaurant!! But definitely order it. It wasn't listed on the menu. I only knew to ORDER it, thanks to YELP REVIEWS that i read beforehand. OMG so good! but kept me UP ALL NIGHT.. it was such a strong tea that I really think that After my dinner meal, it still kept me wired late into the night!! I LOVE IT THOUGH!

Also, Some of my fave udon was: Mentaiko cream sauce (interesting flavour,,, sorta reminds me on those original flavour instant noodles... but addictive flavour to it). I was lucky enough to try a few different udon flavours because we came as a group and got to enjoy ordering a different bowl for each person (sharing it all between us of course!!). 
I can't say i remember enjoying the other bowls THAT MUCH MORE because after eating all the different \"CREAM\" sauces, they all sort of tasted the same after, especially when there was nothing new in the textures as we ate the udon. 
The original Kama and  oven baked udon (unique because it reminded me of a western meal since it had CHEESE) were unique but then when we also ordered a bunch of other udon with cream sauce -- i Cannot really remember what i enjoyed. 

I would definitely come here again. I can't say I have craved eating another creamy udon in  A LONG while because it is not the typical meal I usually want to eat since it just feels too HEAVY. Good thing we had a group to share it with because one UDON order is really too big to finish by one person like me. 

Great spot though!"}
{"text":"Owner was kind enough to offer an invitation for complimentary dishes after the previous \"visit\".

What a difference!  Service was greatly improved.  Periodic checkups to see if everything was okay and water was always full.  It was a Monday night so it wasn't a full house, but was not empty either.

We had the smoked salmon with parsnip sauce and the albacore tuna tataki.  Both were absolutely delicious and was a good starter.  

Main dish was the salmon cream sauce udon.  My goodness was it ever delicious.  Before this meal, I only eat udon with soup.  The description was so appealing that I decided to try it and was it ever a good decision.  Highly recommend this dish.

Absolutely amazing food and will definitely visit again soon."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to Menami ever since it opened but never got a chance. The place was surprisingly full for a Friday night, but the place had a lot of tables that were reserved. I'd recommend reserving beforehand to avoid a long wait. The patio should be decent when it gets warmer.  

We ordered karrage, the corn fritters, oven roasted pork belly, and udon. The karrage was much smaller than expected as was pretty okay overall. The fritter was okay pretty decent, as is anything that is deep fried. I didn't like the oven roasted pork belly, not really flavorful and just overly chewy.  The udon was pretty decent overall. We ordered two for three people. I liked the seafood one better.

We ordered cocktails as well. The matcha cocktail was pretty bold and wouldn't recommend for everyone. The Sailormoon drink was pretty decent. The Geisha straight up tastes like cough syrup so maybe avoid that one. The bartenders were referring back to a sheet to make the cocktails, but it's probably because people usually get beer here. Overall, I thought it was okay. There's probably better izakaya places at a cheaper price and there was no real must have dish."}
{"text":"Perfect for a Friday night. Very unique social restaurant with cute employees. I ordered the mentaiko creamy udon which was Delish and had great flavour. I also had the oven baked udon which I found too cheesy and the corn kaki-age which was essentially deep fried corn nibblets. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick drink (or two). Service was quick and friendly despite the place being  completely packed.

I had the \"dreaming pikachu returns\" cocktail it was super tasty!

And a Sapporo, which is Sapporo so no surprises lol."}
{"text":"There's usually a difference when I eat instant ramen at home vs. eating it in restaurants. Restaurant ramen greater than instant ramen. But....this wasn't the case at MeNami. To reconfirm everyone's comments about it tasting like frozen udon, it does taste like frozen udon. I'm not saying it's bad, but if I'm going to pay $10+ for an udon, I prefer it to taste better than the frozen udon I buy at t&t. 

On a side note, I though the fried chicken was good - juicy and not overly oily."}
{"text":"L O C A T I O N 
In North York on the corner of Yonge St and Holmes Ave. It's the big brown door on the corner. They have quite a bit of street parking. Came in on a Friday night and the waiting area is small, no chairs, and you'll feel the gust of wind when someone opens the door.

//Potato Cream Curry Udon// ($13) OH-EM-GEE This was absolutely delicious!! Who ever thought mash potato on udon was a good idea is seriously a genius. I had my hesitations on this, but am so glad I got it. It was creamy, noodle-ly, and it had a nice mellow curry heat to it. After finishing the udon I drank the potato soup because it was just THAT good (don't judge me).
//Black Sesame Puree Udon w/ Beef// ($15) This too was mouth-watering-ly yummy. It had a strong nutty savory flavor that balances out the potato cream udon. 
//Oven Baked Udon// ($15) This dish was good too, but I might have gotten more than I can chew. I feel like I can make this at home since it has Tex-Mex cheese and bacon bits. It was cheesy and still delicious but the first two dishes blew my mind. 
//Hickory Smoked Old Fashioned// ($15) Wish I sat in the bar when bartender made this because it looked cool from far away. He burned a little bit of hickory and trapped it inside a glass dome with the drink inside. The drink had a good balance of whiskey to ice.
S E R V I C E 
Since we came during peak time service was understandably slow. We had to wait about 45 minutes till a table was ready. At one point we saw some patrons leaving early because the food came out too slow so they had their food on takeout boxes instead. When we finally got seated our waitress was very pleasant and let us know in advance that the kitchen was backed-up. You can tell that the servers were stretched thin because they've been working/walking non-stop. Had to flag down the waitress or whoever to help us with our meal/cashing out. Still they provided pleasant service.
O V E R A L L
Came here solely because I saw a video of Insider Food about this place. Their delicious Potato Udon and Black Sesame Beef Udon were to die for! Even though the wait for seating was long, the food made up for it. Service was good considering it was a busy weekend night. Will return...with empty bellies next time."}
{"text":"The udon DOES taste different here.  It should since the chef was sent to Japan to learn the fine culinary arts of making and serving udon.

The meal was off to a promising start with the deep-fried corn kaki-age (hot and crunchy) and the smoked salmon with parsnip puree (hint of smokiness).  It really helped whet the appetite for the udon bowls.

I decided to keep with the more traditional side of the menu and try the mentai ankake udon.  This consisted of a spoonful of mentaiko (marinated roe of pollock or cod), ginger, wakame, and green onions sitting on top of a pile of udon.  The server would come by to pour this thick transparent soup into the bowl and you are asked to mix the roe with the soup to evenly diffuse it.  Thus every bite of udon is coated with roe and soup.  I found it an interesting udon experience and enjoyed the slithery texture and the firm udon noodles.

I also had bites of the curry udon and spicy pork udon from my tablemate's bowls and they were also quite nice.

I would like to come back and sample more of the traditional udon offerings they have here before I venture over to the fusion side of the menu.

Ultimately, I feel like the prices and variety of the udon bowls almost invite someone like me to have two bowls in one sitting which I may do next time! Bahahaha."}
{"text":"Got the oven baked udon ($15 before tax and tip). It's a good portion for one person! The bowls are big but not a lot of noodles, so you don't need to share between two people. 

I'm impressed with the quality of food. The presentation looks amazing and just like the menu, the sauce isn't salty and the ingredients are fresh! The shrimp (although there's just 2), was crunchy and the udon had nice chew to it. The plates are also so unique! They have cool designs at the bottom that you can see when you finish your meal.

Service is excellent! The staff are so polite and attentive.

Vibes are great though the look and feel throws me off. I'm a little confused by the decor, it seems like they were going for modern with some random accents. There were modern lightbulbs, marquee lights, rustic tree branches, wood panels, gray walls, iron stools, chalk boards, along with floral wallpaper, electic metal displays, green underlighting, old jazzy music and ancient wooden doors."}
{"text":"Left Menami feeling pretty unimpressed. 

Although I do love the decor and music of the place, some of the food and service was subpar. 

To start, we had the corn kaki-age, wasabi octopus (tako-wasa), pork belly, and beef tataki. All of which was a disappointment with the exception of the octopus. The corn was drenched in oil and had way too much batter. Would not pay $5 again for a few niblets of corn. Pork belly was overcooked, dry, and served with raw onions... which was just confusing. Beef tataki was not fresh, and came dark brown instead of red. 

Thankfully I did enjoy the udon. The noodles are so on point, perfect texture and chewiness. Seafood udon was definitely our favourite for the night. Oven baked udon was good, but tooo much cream and cheese for our liking. It very filling. 

I was VERY UNIMPRESSED with the service. It took forever just to get our water refilled and it wasn't even busy. We weren't able to get a hold of the waiter/ waitress and ended up asking the chef for water. One of the waitress was applying makeup in the front of the restaurant and the waiter was on his phone. 

Overall verdict: Tapas are a miss. Udon is good."}
{"text":"I'm still not particularly impressed with Menami, but my most recent visit didn't suck. I got the corn kaki-age and the deep fried eggplant. 

The kaki-age, while tasty, was a tad chewy in an unpleasant way. I'm not sure whether this is because this is the texture of fried corn in general, or because they use cheap corn. The dip that came with it was good, but definitely not memorable. If I recall correctly, the kaki-age itself tasted similar to rice krispies cereal.

I got the deep fried eggplant thinking it would be something more like eggplant tempura. Nope. They took a whole eggplant, shaved exactly one strip of skin off of it, then popped the entire thing into the fryer. Then they topped it with a ton of different toppings and a sauce. While the entire thing was tasty, it definitely wasn't what I was expecting. Not bad for price though.

When we tried to get our bill, the waitress said she would get it, and then began doing other things instead. Then she forgot our bill. Eventually, we had to flag another waitress to get it for us."}
{"text":"Its great that there is a new place opening up and best of all its a udon place which is unique to the area or even in Toronto. I ate earlier but wanted to try this place so my friends and I decided to stop by or drinks. To my surprise the owner from Han Ba Tang was working and she greeted me as she does at Han Ba Tang.

She told me about opening and that they have a udon machine in-house to make fresh noodles for the patrons. The interior is different from Han Ba Tang but nicely renovated compared to the Japanese restaurant that was previously there before. It is an open kitchen concept so you get to see how they make their dishes.

I was recommended to try to the smoked salmon with parsnip sauce. When you first take a bite, it is chilled and the taste is refreshing with the parsnip sauce. I didn't have a chance to try to large selection of udon variations but will return soon to try those dishes. I did, however, try the fresh sake from the tap which was nice given we didn't wanna break the bank that night. They also have a wide variety of premium sake by the bottle that I do not mind returning to help make a dent in their inventory.

More to come with a follow-up review about the other dishes when I return later this month."}
{"text":"Really delicious udon, friendly staff and unique variety of drinks. I tried the plum wine which I highly recommend. Nice ambiance and decor, gets busy so Be prepared for a wait on Friday/Saturdays - but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"In the words of my sister in law, she wanted to \"outsource\" ideas for where to celebrate her upcoming birthday and entrusted me to \"choose\" for her. So in usual fashion, I made her a list of places that I was keen to try and that would be reasonable to go to, and of the list of restaurants, she chose MeNami. 

The decor has a cool rustic elegant appeal to it, with wooden details throughout. I love the marquee sign and the oversized door. I'd passed by MeNami on several occasions but it always seemed packed in the evenings. Luckily the family wanted to have a late lunch, which worked out perfectly because the restaurant was not overly busy. This allowed us to enjoy the attentive service from the wait staff. 

MeNami specializes in house made udon as well as delicious tapas style appetizers. We ordered the corn kaki-age which was lightly battered, full of corn kernels, and served with a honey butter mayonnaise. It was delicious! We also had the spicy salmon tartare with deep fried wonton chips. This was actually a bit too creamy for me and while there was a nice kick from the habanero oil, I would have appreciated some acidity to balance out the fattiness from the salmon and mayonnaise. The pork belly was nicely cooked and seasoned and not overly rich. Our chicken kara-age was served piping hot, with a light crispy batter, and had big chunks of seasoned dark meat. It was one of the better chicken kara-age that I've had. The crispy king prawns were generously sized and also delicious with thin strips of fried taro as garnish.

As it is MeNami's specialty, we each felt compelled to try the udon. Hubby ordered the spicy pork udon (which was not overly spicy but had a pleasant heat from the kimchi to flavour the udon). My father in law and sister in law had the beef yakiniku udon, which was served with oyster mushrooms and thinly sliced beef with a clear broth. They were very generous with the finely sliced onions! My mother in law ordered the dondeki which consisted of teriyaki pork jowl -- the texture of which was firmer and chewy. This came with rice, a small bowl of udon with soup, and a simple cabbage salad (which apparently was refillable).

I wanted a broth-less preparation so I ordered the curry udon with shrimp tempura. Honestly the udon was delicious with the creamy light curry sauce, and I felt could appreciate the chewiness of the fresh-made udon better than had it been soaking in hot broth. After the number of fried appetizers we had eaten, I did not quite enjoy the tempura as much. What I would have probably enjoyed was having the curry udon with kara-age or  pork belly or beef to offset the carb-heavy meal. Perhaps even lightly grilled shrimp might have provided more balance.

It was honestly too much food for each of us to order an entree each after all of the appetizers we had. The appetizers were delicious so I'd probably recommend going with the appetizers and sharing tapas style, with an order of hot pot or udon to share between a few individuals if you don't tend towards big meals. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ordered their cold udon but it was in between hot and cold..some part of udon was still warm. Taste was decent but nothing special to me. Sake was served in a fancy bottle. Service was bit slow."}

{"text":"If that flashy sign at yonge and finch didn't catch your attention enough, the food sure will. After intimidatingly opening those large doors, I realized that there was a smaller door on the side and the large doors are simply for deco.. oops! No biggie, we were welcomed with open arms into this cozy and cute restaurant. 

The waitresses are HOT! Also, kudos to them for wearing mini skirts and shorts when the temperature outside is lower than my motivation in life. They were very friendly and helpful. Service was fast, food was faster. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the pork belly dish! It comes with onions and spring mix and it tastes so flavourful when eaten all together (a tip recommended by Chae of Han Ba Tang as she put the dish down) I also am in looooove with the curry udon with shrimp tempura. I don't even care for the tempura, but damn is the curry ever flavourful!! I was so delighted to taste curry that is not from a damn bag or powder. It is so unique and thick. Perfect with the chewy texture of the udon. 
Corn kaki-age is also a must. I love sweet corn, and this is my guilty pleasure.

The food is so good and the atmosphere is so nice.

MeNami, don't you ever say.. I just walked away.. I will always want you.

No lie, bring me here and I'll probably marry you."}
{"text":"Their curry tempura shrimp udon was delicious. I visited more than a week ago and I still think about it! I'm usually not a fan of udon but this place did something right. I'd be interested in coming back to try their other fusion dishes. My only advice though, for someone who is not completely knowledgeable on udon, to ask your server questions because my husband ordered one (I forget the name) that he thought would have been a stir fry but when it came back it was in a broth. While he still ate it and said it was okay, he is not a soup person so he couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed. Partly our fault for not asking though."}
{"text":"?Corn Kaki-age $5?After seeing countless of pictures of this corn kaki-age, i finally got a chance to try it myself!!

The first bite into it I already knew this would be my staple order from here. The corns were so buttery & sweet. I think the deep fried batter texture is similar to the deep fried blooming onion. Light and crispy. And being a corn-lover I enjoyed every single bite of this dish 

The sauce was good, but for me, the corn kaki-age was seasoned well enough and tasted great without the sauce already

?Tako-Wasa $4?I was really surprised by their portions. Usually tako-wasa comes in a very small bowl and the octopus is chopped in smaller sizes. But Menami's came in a wide plate and the octopus is a lot chunkier

However, if you never had tako-wasa before I actually don't recommend you to try this as your first tako-wasa experience because the slimy texture of the raw octopus might scared you off. The octopus here is a bit softer and more slimy than the ones I normally have at other restaurants. Try at a place where they chop the octopus smaller and have a higher proportion of wasabi roots so there is a better balance of crunchiness & softness (like the ones at Kinka)

?Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon $13?This udon is sooo creamy!! The mentaiko added an extra layer of sweet & salty flavour to the dish. I would like the mentaiko flavour to be stronger though (after mixing it all in you can barely taste it)

Mind you, this udon is pretty heavy though. For me I could get full just eating this without ordering any appetizers *burpppp*"}
{"text":"MeNami is a nice Japanese Udon House in uptown Korea town. Definitely a place not hard to miss with his bright lit sign and big wooden doors. It was quite busy during dinner on a Thursday evening when we went and its also due to the fact they are a small place and have limited seating. For the tapas, I ordered the Corn Kaki age which was corn made with tempura batter dipped in a sweet custard like sauce. It was quite good. From the udon menu, I tried the Over Baked Udon which had shrimp, scallop, bacon, green pepper, white onion and tex mex. It was quite delicious and nicely made. Overall, it was a great dining experience. Staff was friendly and they have a nice cozy ambience. Would highly recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I eat at MeNami regularly. I particularly like their chicken kara-age and corn kaki-age. The chicken is so juicy with a subtle hint of ginger and the batter is on the light side which is such a refreshing change from all the overly battered chicken kara-age out there! 

I also enjoy the torched saba here, it's nothing special but consistently fresh and reasonably priced. The tako-wasa (octupus with nori) is also reasonably price and properly seasoned. The seafood baked udon with cheese is really yummy and super cheesy. We're not big eaters so we can share it between the two of us with an order of chicken kara-age and another app. 

There is street parking right outside MeNami, however, it can be difficult to find a spot during peak eating hours on the weekend and friday nights. 

The music can get loud at this restaurant, which I don't enjoy. You can ask them to turn it down and the one time I did, they did it no problem."}
{"text":"Quite simply, if you love udon then you have to come to MeNami! Fresh in-house made noodles, what's there not to like?

I started with the corn kaki-age which are essentially tempura fritters with corn kernels/ niblets served with a sweet honey mayo. It was good; corn was sweet, the batter was crisp, and doesn't fall apart on you. I had the tsuke udon with shrimp tempura for the main. Note that this ISN'T a warm soup based udon! The noodles were cooked and served lukewarm like pasta, with a separate soy/mirin bases soup/'dipping sauce'. Grated daikon and green onion is served separately and you're supposed to add that to the dipping sauce. I actually didn't know that so was quite surprised when I got it! I would have liked a quick explanation on how to eat this. Anyways! The udon was fantastic - cooked al dente, chewy yet firm. And dipping them was pure slurping heaven. They compliment each other extremely well. There was one piece of tempura and another piece of veggie. They were nice and crisp but I felt like there could have been at least one more piece of shrimp.

I also had the pleasure of tasting the black sesame puree udon (non-soup) which was really unique. Nice and creamy, and not overly sweet. And the thick warm soup of the spicy seaweed udon was rich and flavourful. Seems like all of the udon dishes are great. 

Came here with a party of 6, small trouble getting the table despite telling the guys there we would be in the area, but no big deal. We were willing to wait and had to wait 10/15 minutes tops. There's a great little menu here and I would definitely come back to get more udon when nearby!"}
{"text":"Food it very delicious, especially the spicy pork udon but wasn't a fan of the raw octopus dish because of its weird ginger and wasbi flavouring. Service was very nice. would recommend to come."}
{"text":"You should try the cream udon. This is the best menu!! Nice interior too. Very nice Korean restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I love udon noodles to begin with so I was very excited for this place to be opened. Located conveniently at Yonge and Finch, the bright lights and large ornate doors also attracted me like a moth to a flame. The service that night was pretty good, no complaints. The decor and ambiance feel young and hip. 

We came for a table of 2 early in the evening and was lucky enough to grab a seat right away. By about 7.30pm the restaurant became quite packed and a line started forming. 

I got the fried chicken with cold noodles with a soy dipping sauce. The noodles were nice and chewy and the sauce was umami. The chicken was also freshly fried and was crispy and juicy. The only problem was the portion felt a bit small and I was still a bit hungry. The oven baked udon came out hot and was like pasta in cream sauce was crispy cheese on top, cant go wrong with that. The black samurai cocktail was also delicious, it was really sweet with the Kahlua.

I would go back to get noodles again and to try their tapas"}
{"text":"OMG  i really doesn't want to give a 2 star but I couldnt help! The food and drinks are 5 stars. Value 4 stars. Server were nice. BUT! Our udon waited for more than 45 mins to be ready  and the server never warned as about the time wait. Although they gave us a dish of fried corn balls for free because of the wait. Still I received a $150 parking ticket because the street can not park after 4pm and i was late for 5 mins. I didn't know a quick udon lunch would take longer than 80 min, if i knew the udon took that long to make, ill probably order something else!"}
{"text":"We went on new years eve and we really loved the udon there. The portions were really filling.

We ordered 2 udons and a tapa between 2 people:
Spicy salmon tartare - which was DElicious
Mentai ankake udon - extremely thick soup base, really unique taste
Seafood yaki udon - pretty simple but tasteful soup broth

Lookiing forward to going back one day to try their cheese baked udon and corn kaki-age!"}
{"text":"I have been to MeNami 3 times over the summer and I've got to say that it's now one of my favorites places to go for a meal. I much prefer the lunch atmosphere to dinner. Dinner is busy, loud and service was really subpar. On the other hand, lunch is slower and thus, quiet and more laid back but with excellent service. Udon is their speciality at MeNami so they have a large chalkboard menu promoting their most popular udon dishes and other items hanging right on top of the inner bar. 

My first visit there was during their dinner service and it was extremely busy and chaotic - there was a lineup and wait time to be seated. The wait wasn't too long at 15 minutes. My friend and I were initially seated at the bar where we were able to order from a server within a few minutes. But the bar wasn't very comfy with high top bar stools as chairs, so upon our request, the server moved us to a regular table within about 10 minutes. We ordered the Corn Kaki-age as our appetizer to share and two of the Oven Baked Udon. The Corn Kaki-age was brought out very quickly and it was scrumptious! It was crunchy and sweet and paired really well with the delicious honey butter mayo sauce. However, when the Oven Baked Udon arrived (fairly quick) ... only one was placed on our table. We looked at each other and wondered if perhaps the server misheard and thought we only ordered one appetizer and one main udon dish...for two people. We decided that I would try the Oven Baked Udon that arrived first, just to see how it tasted. Well...it was absolutely delicious. I didn't think udon and cheese would make such a tasty combination, along with bacon and scallops. My friend realized that there was way too much cheese for his liking so he opted to flag down a server to order a different udon dish. The server apologized for the mixup and put in his order of Spicy Pork Udon. Here is where we experienced one of the few cons of MeNami: subpar service from their younger staff and an extremely backed up kitchen. We had to check multiple times on the Spicy Pork Udon because it was taking an extremely long time. The female server we asked had quite a rude attitude when she told us there was long queue of orders before his. I was almost finished my udon dish when his pork udon finally arrived. Upon trying it, he found it not to be spicy at all, which he was disappointed by. I sampled some of his udon dish and agreed. It was lacking in flavour. Sum up for dinner: mostly yummy food but severely lacking in service. 

The next two visits to MeNami were for lunch and the meal experiences were much better. The two women serving customers appeared to be the owners of the establishment, and were very nice and informative when taking orders. They offer a lunch special where you can choose to add on a free pop drink or their house special salad. I'd recommend the salad - it had a tasty dressing and it's a healthy appetizer. My friend and I opted to get the Corn Kaki-age again and to try the Spicy Seafood Soup, which was one pot of soup to share for two people. The Spicy Seafood Soup was absolutely amazing - it was spicy and flavourful. It had shrimp, mussels, and quite a variety of mushrooms (daikon, shitake, oyster). It was in a large pot on top of an electronic cooker placed on our table, that the owner came by to turn on and stir/cook for us. The udon noodles were brought out separately and she even put in the noodles for us. We finished every bit of the seafood soup pot - it was just that good! We even ordered it again for our next lunch there. Sum up for lunch: fantastic food and service to match. 

Definitely recommend MeNami! Their food is cooked fresh, their udon dishes are creative and delicious, and their service is mostly excellent (better during lunch). Can't wait to go back to try their other udon dishes."}
{"text":"3.0 stars
If you like loud bustling younger crowd and udon this maybe the place for you in my opinion the udon is pretty regular stuff perhaps the stacks are better had the eggplant fried it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We arrived at MeNami on a week night, just before 7pm. It was prime dinner time and, as expected, the tables were full at this popular local joint. In lieu of waiting, we were suggested the bar seats which we took. 

The staff were friendly and we were greeted with water and the menu in quick order. The bartender was also very helpful in answering questions and recommendations. 

We ordered a curry udon with shrimp tempura ($11), a kitsune udon ($9), and chichen kara-age ($5) to share. The wait was reasonable with the appetizer coming first. The kara-age was very nicely battered and fried, not too greasy and the meat was quite tender. The udon were up next, both of which were well made. The noodles were just the right firmness and the flavors were well balanced between the ingredients. I must say we were pleasantly surprised. The only thing is the portions being slightly on the small side, but not too bad; I want hungry when I was done, and still had room for desserts afterwards. 

A solid 4/5 stars. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Came to MeNami twice already! Once with my friend and the second time with a few food bloggers and both experiences were excellent.  Tapas are great here!  Great portions to be shared with a group up to 4 people and very reasonable prices. I had the Chicken Kara-age, Corn Kaki-age, Albacore Tuna Tataki, Beef Tataki and Deep Fried Okra.  Out of all the tapas I had, I enjoyed the Chicken Kara-age, Corn Kaki-age and Deep Fried Okra the most.  As you can tell, their fried Tapas are great and the fact they maintain the juiciness of the Chicken really impressed me.  Okra was impressive also, I was never a big fan of Okra but this dish made me get so hooked! Okra fried to perfection with a wasabi kick to it!

Udon, I tried Kitsune Udon and Oven Baked Udon.  I personally prefer the soup base udon more, as they are more traditional and they taste great also! The oven baked udon was good, but I thought it was way too heavy and it occupies too much space in your stomach and prevents you to try anything else.  For drinks I highly recommend the Thai Black Tea, although I wasn't too impress with the coconut flakes on top of the drink, but the tea flavour was tremendous!

MeNami a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"A cool looking restaurant, with some nice looking decor, although there is not a whole lot of seating available. They specialize in udon, and the one I had (beef and mushrooms) was good. The noodles taste pretty fresh and have a nice texture. They also gave a good number of mushrooms although not a whole lot of beef. I also had the chicken karaage as an appetizer however I was not very impressed. Service was pretty slow considering the number of waiting staff and low number of tables. Overall not bad, but wouldn't say it was my favorite place."}
{"text":"Nice cozy hangout for couples, small tables, however, music & food were good. I ordered their fried chicken cold udon noodles, taste wasn't bad, chicken was crispy good, the soup was a bit warm,would be nice if they dump in some shaved ice to make it more refreshing consider being so hot inside... especially in this hot summer weather. I still don't understand why they don't have enough air conditioning, they always have their main door widely opened and the only thing i do not like about it are the flies that come in, which becomes extremely distracting. The location of this restaurant is nicely located on Yonge/Holmes, a bit difficult to find parking on weekends, so I would usually park at the lot across the street and walk across. Worth a try if you're udon lovers!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend on a Friday night around 6:30 pm and definitely overstayed until 10:30 pm. Lol. Busy catching up and ordered a bunch of stuff. 

Food: 
- Corn kaki-age $5 (we had 2, tasty and cripsy with the mayo sauce) 
- Salmon Cream Sauce Udon $13 (good, filling and would recommend. Very creamy and salmon was tender) 
- Oven Roasted Pork Belly $11 (okay but not outstanding, not substantial so prob wouldn't recommend) 

Drinks
- 1 Fruili beer 
- 2 bottles of grapefruit soju, which is surprisingly sweet and good! Never tried before and now my new fav. 

Service was nice, the servers checked up on us a few times, when my friend asked for hot sauce for pork belly dish they asked if the dish was not to their liking, refilled waters without asking. Attentive but not annoyingly so, didnt interrupt us while we were chatting. 

As the night wore on, I noticed the lights dimmed, the music got louder and it became more about the drinks. I really like the atmosphere, it's a fun place to hang out but if you go late at night be prepared to talk louder in order to be heard. Lol. 

Also, just be careful to check the bill at the end cause I think they charged us for 2 bottles of Fruili when we only had 1. I'm not too mad over it given we spent 4 hours there and I had a great time but just a fyi for anyone else."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place ever since it opened last year (was attracted by the huge gate door lol). But I hardly ever go to restaurants for udon so I've delayed my visit till now. 

Corn kaki-age (5 stars) 
I highly recommend this as an appetizer. It's essentially deep fried corn clusters paired w/ honey butter mayo. The texture is similar to fritters but with a crisp outer layer and firm corn kernels in-btwn. It doesn't fall apart on you, and the savory base is elevated by the sweetness of the corn. I would come here just for this side dish. 

Salmon cream sauce udon (3.5 stars) 
The cream sauce resembled carbonara sauce, but while it was tasty, it was a bit too rich & heavy for me. The udon was cooked to perfection though; the texture was firm yet bouncy--you can tell that it's handmade. As for the salmon, it was tender & moist and just the right portion. 

I will definitely be back for their corn kaki-age, as well as to try their cold tsuke udon."}
{"text":"Overhyped! How does this place have 4 stars?

I had pretty high expectations going in after reading the rave reviews and scrolling through the drool worthy pictures. The entrance door was grande, the sign flashy, the décor I would describe as modern industrial meets cabin the woods. The atmosphere is trendy, cozy with top 40s music playing in the background.

My excitement quickly declined as the tapas started rolling out. The tapas were ALL pretty disappointing.

Tako-wasa ($3.5): Octopus was chewy and stringy. Probably been sitting around for too long. Some bits ended up in that gross can't chew this down anymore state... do I spit it out or swallow it awkward situation. Wasabi flavour was good though. I'm a sucker for wasabi anything.

Corn kaki-age ($5): Uhh this is just deep fried corn covered in some dough dipped in mayonnaise? $5 for 5 bite size pieces is hefty. It was greasy and didn't have that much corn. The idea is pretty creative, I'll give them that but I think it could all make this at home pretty easily.

Beef Tataki ($12): Is it suppose to be brown? I later compared my pictures to previous diners and ours looked a lot darker. Saw from where we sat at the bar that it was just plastic wrapped prepackage beef slices put onto the plate. The jalapeno also overpowered everything else. This one did not taste good. 

Pork belly ($11): Prrretty dry and chewy but the dry rub seasoning was great. Would be a solid dish if the pork belly itself was better.

Maybe we went on an off night? None of the tapas were anywhere close to my expectations. I'm usually a can't waste anything, must eat it all kinda person but I honestly didn't even want to finish most of the tapas here.

However, the saving grace of MeNami was the udon noodles! The quality is really good and definitely better than the frozen grocery store variety. It was firm but chewy and the exterior doesn't end up covered in that mushy starchy goop.

Oven baked udon ($14)- VERY heavy. Noodles were drenched in lots of heavy cream, topped with lots of cheese and came with some shrimp, scallops. It was alright. The tapas left a bad taste in my mouth and with that recentcy bias, this dish wasn't able to turn it around.

Seafood Yaki udon ($13)- OH YUM THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD! Perfect sauce to udon to seafood ratio and I enjoyed watching the bonito dance. By far the favourite dish of the night and the only thing I would want to try again. 

In terms of service, I echo the other yelpers that it's pretty abysmal. The waiters all gave off a \"Ughhh I'd rather be anywhere else but here\" vibe. Usually when you establish some extended eye contact with servers at restaurants, you have comfort that you're acknowledged and they realize that you need some service BUT nope not at MeNami.

So yes, 3 stars. 1 star for the lovely décor, 2 stars for the seafood udon. Left pretty disappointed BUT I would give it another shot to try a soupy udon if I was particularly craving udon or forced to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Came here last week with the boyfriend. Very pleased with their food. Their corn kaki-age with honey mayo is AMAZING. We didn't expect to like it much but ordered because we were recommended to, and boy we were very happy that we did. We also got their mentaiko cream sauce udon and seafood yaki udon, which were both very delicious. I will definitely recommend anyone to try out this place, and I will be back soon for sure!!"}
{"text":"In a part of Central North York's Yonge Street (that I like to call North Koreatown), populated with a variety of Asian diners with more or less the same kind of all-familiar barebones comfort experience (and a couple downtown culinary colonialists like Kinton Ramen establishing an eating post this far north), MeNami begs to stand out in the area with its blazing bright sign, giant corner doors, and a hip trendy décor more reminiscent of a Queen West bar than, say, your average run-of-the-mill Korean or Viet restaurant. I guess it is working, as this place has become an instant popular hit--so proud of their cover feature on a NOW Magazine on new Japanese places to eat, they plastered several copies of it all over their windows.

The menu is all udon, all the time, done in many ways, all made in-house. The multitude of savoury to-share appetizers like beef tataki and pork belly helps to get growling stomachs started. The bar is equipped with under-counter electrical outlets, which I guess is useful to charge up mobile devices while drowning in whatever combination of draft sake, beer and soju.

As for the udon dishes, they are served in many ways: cold, in soup, or in some odd gwai-lo kind of way. The 'original' Tsuke Udon ($7.95) has a clean presentation and a nice chewy and salty taste, and you dip it in a soy-based dipping sauce tsukemen ramen style. A bit more on the traditional side, the mentai ankake udon ($10) was interesting too, with its thick-ass slimy broth with a miso soup flavour. What was really fun was their Oven Baked dish ($14), essentially udon that is more like mac-and-cheese than udon, and it is awesome.

Other than a odd mixup with bill-splitting among our party that resulted in a mysterious and awkward check produced for a non-existent person, service here was fairly decent.

{TTC: Finch subway station}"}
{"text":"Came here for the cream udon but it was too creamy (milk and butter are a bit too much, I can't even handle two bites of it). But the fresh ika karaage is definitely recommended! Their corn kakiage is just ok. The deep fried king prawn is fresh! But the winner for sure is the ika because we order the second one even before we finish our first bowl. Yes, it's that good!! We order the tonkatsu and the seafood udon but they are mediocre."}
{"text":"I keep coming back! Service is very fast! Server keeps filling up our water. Food was amazing! We ordered the corn twice because it's that good! We also ordered crispy king prawns to share! A bit spicy but very tasty. Highly recommend the salmon with cream sauce over baked udon! Awesome experience overall!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is surprisingly good. I couldn't believe I had never noticed it, with it's huge over-the-top doors on the corner of Yonge and Holmes Ave., just two streets south of Finch station.

I highly recommend the mentaiko creamy udon, which I stole a lot of from my friend because I ordered the creamy salmon udon. It was really yummy, and you can say that you ate a sack of fish eggs!

The salmon udon I ordered was pretty good too, but I think I prefer the mentaiko because it was different and had a really nice taste and texture to it when you mixed the fish eggs in with your udon.

It is a bit pricey for a small portion of udon, but I think it is worth the experience. Will be returning eventually, but there are sooo many more wallet friendly options down Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a few friends. It was really busy but there was no wait for a table. The servers did not look friendly upon entering. Even when they served us water and menus, they seemed like they were bored of their repetitive tasks. 

Onto the food.
Tako wasabi: I loved this. The tako wasabi had a strong wasabi flavor here which I love. 

Karaage: this was mediocre. I would suggest not ordering this here.

Oven baked udon: this was the highlight. The udon! I was so excited to try this since Yelp pictures of this seems so cheesy and I love cheese. It was indeed filled with lots of cheese. They do not skimp out on cheese on this udon, you can see a lot of cheese on the noodles. It was so good but so filling at the same time. Probably best to share this with someone and order another lighter  udon to share. I will come back just to get this again. 

For drinks we just got soju and beer. The prices are on par with other bars nearby."}
{"text":"This is a hipster korean udon and sake bar. It's a fairly busy restaurant and service isn't great. They are slow at first but once you wave them down to put in your order, the food is quick to arrive. We ordered:
- Tako Wasabi - we always order this when it's on a menu. It was very fresh with the right amount of wasabi
-  Corn Kaki-age - recommended a lot on yelp so we decided to order it. So simple, but crisp was perfect and paired with the perfect honey mayo dip. I could like that dish up
- Black sesame udon - my bf was feeling adventurous but he liked it. He felt like he was eating the chinese black sesame dessert.
- Curry shrimp udon - nothing bad to say about it!
The udon was thick and chewy and tasted like it was homemade. The next time we visit, we will try the basic plain udons!"}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance of this place. Their black sesame udon was great. I just got back from Tokyo and I was worried I was going to be disappointed but I was pleasantly surprised :) I would go back to try their other fare. If only they were closer to Sheppard I would be going here for lunch! I also tried their \"Crispy King Prawn\" - the habanero sauce was spicier than I thought and was a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Their udons are in general pretty good.  Also tried the corn-raage. I feel the other reviews raised my expectation by a lot that the actual dish certainly does not meet that.

Also I wouldn't recommend the chicken karaage. It is the worst karaage I have had so far. Each piece is too big so the inside is still uncooked. The sauce is also not a good fit for fried chicken."}
{"text":"MeNami always seem to be packed, as it was on this Saturday night. 

As we were but a pair, luckily there was no wait for bar seats. We didn't mind. 

The restaurant has a relaxed ambience. The dimmed lights and decor keep the place casual. Although service was slow tonight, the staff were always preoccupied with something.

We ordered : Fried okra, beef tataki, baked udon and their special, potato cream udon.

Fried okra = 5/10. Not really flavoured, the okra was tempura-ized. It came out very hot. It's not anything special, but we like okra.
Beef tataki = 9/10. garnished with green and white onions, the tataki was drizzled in a mildly sweet & spicy sauce. The flavour and the texture of this was the best I've had so far.
Baked udon = n/a I only had a bite of this, as seafood is not my jam. I thought it was good. My friend is a big seafood lover and recommends this. Cheesy and rich in flavour, it will fill you up.
Potato cream udon = 8/10. Interesting combination of creamy mashed potatoes on top, and \"spicy\" curry underneath. I found this delicious, but can see that it's not for everyone. This dish came out cooled. I didn't realized that there was broccoli in the bowl until I reached the bottom.

MeNami has a creative twists suitable for many udon lovers. Fitting for a group of friends or a date, this is a great place to go. Just remember to make reservations."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid, and I'm a regular since one of my friends loves this place. So I can say consistently they have really good dishes.

My favourites are either the shrimp udon (with clear broth) or the creamy mentaiko (heavier white sauce). The corn is also like crack, so yes you should get it. 

I think what makes this place great is the feel of a simple meal with quality ingredients, because too often restaurants either fall into the 'fast junk food' or 'overpriced fancy food'. The foods in this restaurant tastes like somebody put in some effort, it's not easy to replicate at home, and price point is reasonable. That's why I come here often. The atmosphere is pretty chill too so you can come with friends or for a date."}
{"text":"First of all, the service at the restaurant was great. The waiter was willing to show and explain to us what some of the menus were and it made it easier for us to decide what to order. Secondly, the food was really delicious as well. All the udons were served in quite large portions, I was not able to finish it all but it was still very good. The menus included various small tapas that you can share with your friends, and they are very willing to split the bill so it was easy to pay with a group of friends. 

It's a nice place to visit for lunch, but I also felt that it would be a decent hangout place for friends to have drinks and just chill with some hot udon soup on this cold winter day! :)"}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this place to me and told me they are special with their udon. 
Went around dinner time on a weekday and they were very busy. They have bar seatings as well. Very modern decor but a small place. 
What we ordered:
1. Hamachi - it was ok. 
2. Chicken karrage - nothing special 
3. Tonkatsu -the meat was thinly fried which was nice.
4. Black sesame purée with beef udon - the combination is a little strange. It was sweet and savory at the same time but udon itself was cooked just right. Very al Dante. 
5. Corn - highly recommend
6. Pork belly - recommend. The pork belly was cooked just right. 

The owner was very nice. She came out and asked how we like out food. She also own another Korean restaurant around the area. Service was great as well. 
Overall, I would recommend this place and will come back to try their other not so strange combination udon. They also have a pretty big alcohol & cocktail list."}
{"text":"Great service, casual trendy atmosphere. Food was delicious, lots of flavour, and the portion size of each tapas dish was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was lured here cuz my buddy said his fiance wouldn't want him here; too many cute waitresses. Naturally, I coerced him to this place. Or was it the other way around? hm...

It was one of those places that tried a little too hard and became a little too hip. I mean.. How many dangling pieces of salvaged forest wood can one cram into a space? It was starting to look a little bit like a matchstick house about to catch fire any second now. But the vibe is cool and it's a place you can chill for a few hours.

We had an assortment of tapas items ending with one of the udons. The broth and beef kind reminded me of Korean bulgogi. Sweet soy with strong hints of ginger, onions and sesame. It was a simple and light broth and the noodles were okay for the most part but definitely not in the upper echelon of udons; it can use a little more squeak as it was a bit too tender. All in all, it's an adequate bowl of udon. We had the prawns as recommended and they reminded me of a poor man's tempura. The prawns are nice and snappy but the batter could use a little work - not quite as crisp and soggy in some areas. The flavours are a little too pure though there is a dip but it will do little to inspire your taste buds. Next was the infamous corn; a strange creation of sort. Kernals of corn dipped in a very typical batter and deep fried golden. It was neither crispy nor soggy but sorta in between - the taste and texture is kinda... a bit undecided. Not quite sure what the motivation or the kind of taste this dish is supposed to evoke. Lastly, it was the pork belly. To be frank, this was a huge letdown and it's tough to fail the mighty bacon. Somehow, it was lifeless, sad and chewy. I pity the pig that gave up it's belly for this.

All in all, I would say it's a interesting place to chill but the bites are so-so."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice because I love Sanuki udon and it's hard to find freshly made ones in town. 
I have had the cold udon...loved it! It's simple and not fussy. At the same time, I also tried the pork belly and corn fritters. The pork belly wasn't very memorable and the corn fritters was too sweet for an appetizer. The corn itself is sweet and the sauce was mayo looking but had a sweetness. I think it should be paired with a spicy sauce instead. 
The second time I had the tempura udon. Again, love the chewiness of the udon and if you don't mind the tempura getting a little soggy in the soup (or immediately put it on the side to avoid this), the soup is light and not overpowering. 
I had to lose a star for their service. It's a hit or miss and both times, for some reason, the miss part comes at the end when it's time to pay for the bill. The bill was asked and the waitress seemed to have forgotten to come back to see if we need the machine or not. One  time, it wasn't busy at all and we could see the waitress at the back of the kitchen sweeping and cleaning plates. It's frustrating when your paid parking time is up. 
If they paid a bit more attention to service, their ratings could go up higher."}
{"text":"We came to MeNami for an early dinner on the weekend. It is the same owner from Han Ba Tang that opened this restaurant. The interior is similar to HBT - very hipster haha.

ROASTED PORK BELLY (4/5)
This was delicious! Loved the marinated pork belly. It wasn't too fatty, *like*! :)

SMOKED SALMON with parsnip sauce (4/5)
The smoked salmon was very fresh. The parsnip sauce paired surprisingly well with the salmon. 

BEEF UDON (2/5)
There was a mishap with their kitchen for my beef udon... can ask me for details but I'll just leave it at that. The owner was nice about it though! 
I'll still return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The spicy seafood soup for two was excellent. They were generous with the mussels, shrimp and scallops. Also, the broth base was very clean and light with no discernible oily scum on the tongue. It was zesty, had the tang of the sea and was a pleasing, mild heat. 

My guest and I also got the black sesame udon with beef. The black sesame appears as a paste-like sauce that literally drenches the noodles in a deep grey miasma. The texture is delightfully smooth and the black sesame leaves a nutty aroma with a hint of sweetness. While the noodles and sauce were tasty, the beef was neither special or awful. 

Finally, I will come back but will avoid coming in the evenings. While getting a table may seem the issue, I found the fluorescent- nay, neon lighting coming from the tv I was sitting in front of to be nauseating à la discotheque. If I do end up here again in the evenings, I will be sure to be mindful so I am not again left to bask in the glow of a television set. 

PS: As a warning to my fellow AmEx holders, they do not accept our platinum and black plastics."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm and it was about 80% full.  By the time we sat down and had our menus, there was a queue forming.  Tried the Yaki Niku Udon and friend had the Tempura Udon.  The food took a while to get to us - not sure if they handmake their udon in their kitchen, but it did take a while.  The bowls seemed pretty big and the broth for both were a bit different.  Overall, pretty filling udon -- will come back later to check out other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Went with 5 other friends to this place after work. This restaurant specializes in various kinda udon noodles. We each ordered a bowl of noodle and I ordered their noodle with beef in black sesame puree because their pictures looked good on Yelp and I wanted to try something different. The noodle was good however portion was small. Was still hungry after spending close to $20 after taxes on the noodles."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to check this place out because I had heard such good things about it, but honestly I was disappointed.

We started with the corn kaki-age that I've seen being highly recommended in other reviews. It wasn't bad but it was very very average; my friend commented that it tasted like the cheesy corn you get at Korean fried chicken places (like The Fry) and I agree. 

Next we both had udon soups - kitsune for me and spicy pork for her - and that's where things went wrong. The handmade noodles were very good but the broth in mine was way too salty (my friend agreed, not just me), as was the tofu. There also wasn't much to it other than the big piece of salty tofu and one fish cake. My friend didn't really enjoy her udon either and said that the broth had a weird smell to it.

All in all, not one of the better udon restaurants we've tried. Will likely not come back but if I decide to give this place another chance, I will definitely not be ordering any of the soups."}
{"text":"Fantastic udon noodles!

The tsuke(dipping) udon had perfect noodles, firm yet still had that chewiness that udon should always have. The cold noodles are dipped into a sweet soy sauce mix which was perfect. 

The oven baked udon was interesting for sure. Essentially really cheesy Alfredo sauce with udon noodles, a bit of bacon and some seafood. Topped off with of course, the oven baked Tex mex cheese. Fair warning, it's really cheesy."}
{"text":"Update: Recently went to Menami for the third time and it again didn't disappoint. This time we ordered the braised beef short rib One pot. The soup base has walnuts, dates and squash so all the flavors with the short rib went really we together. You can also add udon (two portions) for an extra $3. I think it's great value as it's more than enough for two people. Would highly recommend trying their One Pots!"}
{"text":"Happened to park on the side street right in front of menami. Was walking on our way to ZenQ... And we were feeling for a snack before dessert. Decided to grab a table and wasn't disappointed. Got the spicy crispy prawn which had crispy taro shavings, and a sweet and spicy creamy chili sauce. Salmon tartare was very interesting as well. Both very good. Would come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Their Udon is just the best in Toronto in my opinion. Quiet cheap too, $12-15 for 1 person portion.
A little loud, and sometimes hard to have a conversation with the person accross from me, but the food is good enough to make up for it."}
{"text":"The food was good (albeit pricey ~$20 pp), but unfortunately we were greeted by some unpleasant service. We were late for our reservation so when we arrived, we were told our table had been given away. When asked why we weren't phoned, she replied 'we don't phone because we trust our customers.' -- then why do you need my number in the first place? Fair enough, we were late and luckily still had a table, albeit very cramped for 5 people, but it was unnecessary to be treated with attitude. (And how long do restaurants keep reserved tables for until it's deemed 'late' and able to be given away?) I'm just disappointed because of all the hype and advertising on Instagram to be treated this way. 

I had the Salmon Cream Udon - salmon just barely cooked (like sous vide), pretty good, and I liked the cream sauce. Honestly I don't taste much different from regular frozen udon, but this udon is more soft and less chewy. 

The Mentaiko Udon and Albacore Tuna Tataki were good and I liked the watercress in the spicy seafood soup. Also tried the popular corn kakiage which tastes like it sounds - deep fried battered sweet corn."}
{"text":"MeNami does not disappoint when it comes to udon noodles. Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of these noodles to begin but this place has me enthralled and wanting to come back for more. 

If you are a first time visitor, I would recommend the Salmon Cream Sauce Udon and Sesame Beef Udon. If you like alfredo pastas, the first option is your guy. The sauce is perfectly creamy and the chewy noodle texture pairs well with its (small) piece of salmon companion. The second winner, sesame beef is equally outstanding. The plate has a very unique asian sesame flare to it, I would say its got a harmony of sweet (but not overwhelmingly so) and savory flavors (and well seasoned beef to boot). 

Definitely will return to try to the corn kaki-age, in addition to the two mains above.

TIP: Reservations help as this place gets quite a bit of traffic during dinner time."}
{"text":"I wish there was a MeNami where I live. The food here is amazing and very filling! We ordered the Oven Baked Udon and Salmon Cream Sauce Udon. Both were super creamy and the udon had a nice chew. The taste and textures are different from what anyone would be familiar with regarding udon because of the cream sauce and flavours. We also ordered sake-- the plum sake is very fruity.

The service was good, and overall experience was great."}
{"text":"Udon is probably one of my favourite things to cook at home, so I was interested to try a restaurant's take on the thick noodles. We ordered the salmon cream udon and black sesame purée. The salmon was absolutely delicious. I could've done with a little less creaminess in the udon, but it was still a delicious bowl at a reasonable price.

Service was fast - the store was pretty empty as we went on a weekday for lunch. I love that it has a lit-up sign outside, so you can't miss it driving down Yonge St."}
{"text":"The wait was not so bad. We got lucky as a reservation was canceled so we were seated in no time. You can always sit at the bar too if you don't want to stand and wait. 

Everything on this menu was so yummy! Gotta love udon. We ordered the oden (for two) but we shared it with our table of four and ordered a few tapas and a main dish on our own and it was just enough. I'll let the pictures speak more than words on this one. They did mix up our order but made it up to us by giving us the tapas for free. 

I would love to come back here again to try more tapas, the drinks and perhaps desserts!"}
{"text":"There wasn't really anything that stood out from my experience. I personally felt that it was a bit pricey for the quality or the portion. Perhaps I'll have to try more dishes but MeNami for sure has a great ambiance. Street parking is available and close to the TTC."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend on Friday night, I was surprised how there was no wait line as we got a table right away. They have an extensive sake list, beers and mixed drinks. The restaurant is narrow and quite charming; their decor is rustic/modern. They opened the windows which let a slight breeze come through but I would have loved some AC as well as it was a very warm day. The food was delicious, delicate and interesting. The corn fritters were light and crispy, the cream/mayo sauce that accompanied it made it melt in your mouth. The egg plant dish that we ordered was divine, yes $6 for a piece of egg plant is expensive but the flavours were there. The udon is the star of the restaurant; their noodles are chewy and not soggy/soft. I ordered the udon with tempura. The noodles were divine and they provide you with you soy sauce to dip it in. There were only 2 pieces of tempura, I was hoping for more. This was also a cold udon dish which I wasn't expecting. My friend ordered the black sesame udon with beef. The sweet and salty combination of that dish was very good. I think I would skip the tempura udon next time and order something more exciting. The servers were very kind and attentive. I would love to come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"MeNami is known for their house-made authentic Japanese udon noodles. What separates freshly made udon from frozen is the firm texture it holds and so it is no wonder that the process of making udon requires professional skills and great attention to detail. Not only does MeNami serve udon dishes, they also offers a tapas menu, rice dishes, as well as large shareable items for two.

The restaurant has a great selection of Japanese sake, beer, Korean alcohol, and not to mention they have sake on draft. There is also a wide variety of sake-based cocktails on their menu.

Highlights:

Smoked Salmon with Parsnip Sauce
Convention Roasted Pork Belly 
Corn Kaki-Age
Kake Udon with Chicken Thigh Tempura
Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon

The Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon was my absolute favourite dish of the night! The sauce was creamy which made the noodles very silky and delicious. I couldn't taste the mentaiko and I wasn't sure if I should be able to taste it or not, but regardless these noodles were fabulous! I especially loved how well the udon paired with the cream sauce and I don't think anyone would have thought that these ingredients combined would create such an amazing dish. 

I loved how all the dishes were unique and different from regular Japanese dishes you're used to. I highly recommend this restaurant because you get the best quality food at such an affordable price. Even if you're just looking for a nice Asian bar to hang out at, MeNami has everything you need!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in North York. MeNami is one of the new eateries in the cut that serves authentic hand made udon, served in a variety of ways from bowls of thick soup based noodles to pasta-style cream sauce udon. 

There is also a great list of tapas dishes, such as the Torched Mackerel, Smoked Salmon with Parsnip puree and a variety of fried items. 

The cocktails/sake/soju/beer offerings is also great, and the casual dining room and long bar makes the place really appealing and exciting.  

There's also a secret drink (Thai Iced Tea with Coconut infused milk) that's not on the menu. You can order it with or without whiskey. 

Great first impression of this new restaurant from the owners of Han ba Tang.  

PS: I've been back many times since and have always enjoyed the udon."}
{"text":"Their huge wooden doors and the \"MeNami\" in marquee lights are both eye-catching.  The décor is nice; but I didn't feel I'm welcome here.  The servers here are like models on the runway; they are so cool and offered no smile at all.  Udon here is chewy and smooth.  I had spicy seaweed ankake udon; it came with a few dried shrimps and the gluey thick soup.  The soup didn't come in hot and the gluey starchy thick soup made it even worse.  Tapas are mediocre.  The original tsuke udon is the best tho; have the chewy udon in it's simplest way."}
{"text":"Not good and expensive. Ordered udon with Tempura shrimp and veggies the fried component became Very soggy in addition we ordered udon. Baked with cheese it was very rich and bad"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a hip atmosphere and it's usually quite crowded in the evenings.  I wanted to see what the hype was about and realized that it wasn't the food!  

They serve a lot of appetizers that are seen at an izakaya .. I tried the karaage (fried chicken).  I also ordered the beef/mushroom udon and a salad.  I found everything was okay but nothing really stood out or tasted amazing.  I browsed at other tables and noticed the appetizer portions are really small in general.   The service was also extremely slow, but I think it's because they are understaffed."}
{"text":"Most disappointing Japanese food ever eaten.

I visited this restaurant with my friend who chose this place at it had high reviews on Yelp. 

Service was pathetic, to say the least. Our order was bungled up after being kept waiting for more than 20 minutes finally, when the food did arrive,  it was cold. I cannot understand, if they mixed up the order and then made the food and served immediately, how can it be cold? My friend joked that it must be someone else's order bundled up awaiting its next customer.

The taste was below average,  having eating better food at other establishments. Please do not fall for the four star review, based on my experience it seems Friends of the owner might have given them. Left bitterly,  bitterly disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, I thought it was great! The hot pots are super delicious and huge!!  They're deff shareable. The service was quick and polite. Will deff go back!"}
{"text":"This place makes their own udon and has a great variety of traditional and fusion dishes. Also a great place to catch a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying Menami. I had visited the restaurant at around 10pm and the restaurant was not too busy (maybe 5-6 couples).

The server took our order (corn kari-age), tsuke udon w/ tempura and spicy pork udon. The app came within 5 or so minutes, the entrees however, took more than 20 minutes.

Food was not hot or to temperature, and when the menu says \"shrimp tempura\" they literally mean ONE shrimp and ONE green pepper tempura.

This time around service was lacking, food was not good and I doubt I would visit again."}
{"text":"This place specializes in udon. Our group ordered the seafood and the black sesame udon, the corn karaage and korrokke. The food was good and came out in ample time. However, there just wasn't anything spectacular about it. I wouldn't really go again unless I was asked just because there are so many amazing restaurants in the area that would regularly get a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I came here twice because the food is amazing! 

I call the udon bowls fluffy clouds because that's what the udon texture reminded me of. The udon noodles are soft, but never mushy, springy, but never chewy, and are perfectly content sitting under a bed of whatever sauce you decide to put on.

I came here twice and ordered two different kinds of sauce: salmon cream and black sesame. Both are fantastic. 

The salmon cream reminds me of clam chowder with a bit of salmony flavor. The salmon cream is very mildly savory and complements the udon in a non-palate shocking way. If you like seafood, cream, and noodles, this is your udon bowl.

The black sesame has a bit of a wow factor and is a bit messy for anyone who slurps and wears light color clothes. The black sesame sauce is nutty, sweet, with a hint of savoriness at the same time. If you're a bit more adventurous, likes the taste of sesame, and don't mind getting messy, this is your bowl of udon.

In addition to the bowls, I ordered the pork belly and roasted hamachi gama as an appetizer.

The pork belly was honestly average, The pork skin was gummy and chewy, and the meat didn't have much of any flavor except for some salt.

The roasted hamachi gama was very juicy and meaty. Eating this fish is not for anyone skirmish of bones and seeing an entire fish, but if you're one of the ones who appreciates eating the whole fish (bellies and tails and all), you're going to love everything about this little seriola quinqueradiata."}
{"text":"Was hyped about this place as my friend said there were many cute girls and great food. No comment on the girls but the food was just OK. Appearance-wise, it looks a bit try hard for the hipster vibe (there were some American style car decor, which doesn't match the theme for an Asian bar). Food was alright but honestly, there is nothing special about the udon (it tastes the same as the frozen ones you can find in the supermarkets, doesn't taste made in store or fresh). I tried the sesame udon, it is alright but I think the flavours didn't work too well together - the sauce was weak and lacklustre. My friend got the curry udon with shrimp.. it tasted average at best. Nothing mind blowing besides the fact that you can cook udon like a spaghetti... I suppose that is nice for people who haven't eaten udon outside of a soup before. Of course, we also had to get the corn kaki-age. Finally something decent... but perhaps not worth the price - wish they gave a few more pieces!"}
{"text":"Came with friends on Friday night. We were directed to table seats right away. As we realized the bar is opened up (it was full), we switched to the bar voluntarily. The staffs are efficient and attentive, and our food are served pretty fast. 
We ordered deep friend corn, crispy prawn with crispy taro (love it!!!), and beef & mushroom hotpot! The hotpot could have more veggies and mushrooms, but it had enough beef amounts for two, so we ended up not finishing it.
We really enjoyed the bar atmosphere and selection for drinks."}
{"text":"Tuna tataki was served cold (?) Sauce and seasoning start off well but by the time you finish the plate you realize it's a lot salt. Needs to be served hot with less salt in the sauce Corn karaage was pretty good. 

Udon was decent but unremarkable. Tempura batter was a standout though.

Worth stopping by for lunch or dinner but not a special trip to go."}
{"text":"This is like heaven for udon lovers. I had the Kama noodles and I am just in love with the broth.  It's not too salty with a hint of sweetness from the daikon radish.  I would recommend the convection cooked pork belly, the sauce was superb and served with greens and pickled onions - the perfect balance. I would definitely go back! What even better? It's opened until 230am!"}
{"text":"I walked by this place many times and I have no idea why I never bothered to eat here until now!
Upon entrance, the service has been great from start to finish and they were quick in meeting requests despite how busy they were. 
In total, we ordered five dishes and all of them tasted great! We ate the Tako Wasa ($5.50), the Corn Kaki-age ($5.50), Tonkatsu ($9.00), Okonomiyaki ($13.00) and the Salmon Cream Sauce Udon ($14.00). 
My personal favourite was the corn kaki-age and it is something that everyone should definitely order when coming here! What makes this dish taste great is the honey butter dip that comes with it. The dip compliments the corn very well and is very flavourful.
The portions were pretty big as it was very filling. 
The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the Thai Black Iced Tea ($7.00). It is apparently a popular drink but there was just too much cream for my liking. The other drinks on the menu sounded great so I would not hesitate to try something else.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The placed was jammed packed on a Tuesday night so I highly recommend booking reservations! The atmosphere was trendy and loud, the service was very hospitable as the owner came up to our table for a quick chat at the end of our meal. 

We ordered the Fresh Fried Ika ($8.00). It came out piping hot and was very delicious!! 

Oven Baked Udon ($15.00) 
This was creamy, cheesy and really tasty. I highly recommend trying this dish!

Potato Cream Curry Udon ($13.00)
Curry udon topped with mashed potatoes. The curry was a bit watered down but overall tasty. The contrast of warm udon at the bottom topped with cold mashed potatoes was quite odd to me."}
{"text":"Menami is conveniently located at the corner of Holmes and Yonge with plenty of street parking around. I've been wanting to try it for the longest time after seeing so many good reviews about it on Instagram and Yelp.

It's quite confusing when you get there because there are a lot of doors. The doors to get in are not glass and the biggest set. When you get inside you can see it's not the biggest space around but relatively comfortable with trendy decor.  We went for lunch and there were some people there but it was fairly empty. I imagine there would be many more at night as Menami is a bar.

We ordered the corn kaki-age (because that seems to be the thing to get). I got a salmon cream udon and my brother got the oven baked udon.

The corn kaki-age ($5) was good but not as mind blowing as people made it seem. What was really good was the honey butter mayo! It was light and sweet and overall delicous.. and probably deceptively fattening because it really does feel that light!

I thought the salmon cream udon was delicious ($13). It's not too heavy tasting but it is quite filling as udon is also a heavier noodle. There wasn't too much salmon but after eating a Shiso Tree Cafe where they gave literal slivers of salmon this seemed much better. It was soft and flavorful. There is some tomato oil in there but it's only slightly noticeable. I only finished half! I only had a few bites of the oven baked udon ($15), but it was very cheesy and creamy with some seafood and bacon in there as well. Definitely a heavy dish and heavier than the salmon cream udon - I wouldn't have been able to finish it, but my brother did.

Service was courteous throughout and in the end the total came to about 40 dollars. It's on the pricier side but for what was an overall good experience I felt that it was worth it! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant at Finch and Yonge! If you like ramen or noodle dishes I recommended you come here. 

Tried the corn appetizer - delicious with the mayo. 

Had the seafood udon and the salmon noodle dish! Both really creamy and had different flavours mine was teriyaki flavoured and my friends was like an alfredo salmon udon. 

Recommended if you want to try something different"}
{"text":"I had a very unique bowl of udon at MeNami. It was called the black sesame puree udon with beef, and wow! The bowl is deceptively filling (I assume because the sauce is so heavy), and the flavour was nutty with a hint of sweetness. I'm not quite sure I enjoyed a entrée with that amount of sweetness, but regardless, it was different from the usual and I liked that. One reviewer suggested eating this dish with darker clothing, and she's right: it gets messy even if you aren't a slurper. I also ordered the corn kaki-age, and I'm not a huge fan. The portions were small, the sauce was simple, and it was basically fried corn + dough. Overall, this restaurant was okay."}
{"text":"Menami is a very fun experiment of a restaurant. Lots of fun udon dishes, great hot pots, and a bunch of oddball drinks (spiked thai iced tea!) coupled with some great beers (delirium on tap, what?).

My girlfriend and I have been coming here for months, and I don't think we've ever had a bad experience. That being said, we tend to gravitate towards our fave dishes a lot (black sesame beef udon, mmmm) so I can't say we've tried most of the menu at all. We get them time after time because they do them very well though. The owner has stopped by our table on several occasions just to check in - a nice, appreciated gesture  Overall, I'd sum up Menami as a fun night out with good food and drink. It's not the cheapest place around, but the experience is consistently fantastic, and no one can say that they don't bring anything new to the table!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! And from my first experience they really know how to make a very tasty bowl of udon. Definitely and probably my most favorite place to get Udon noodles. Even though I only tried one of their udon bowls, it was a wonderful first time experience and wish I could try more items on their menu! 

I had gotten the the Yaki udon, I thought it came as a creamy sauce but it came in a soup! But that's ok because the soup udon was very tasty! Good portion and the texture of the udon was made so well! It wasn't overcooked where its too soft and mushy. It had a nice chewy texture and a litte firmness in the noodle. (Yes hard to explain the experience so just bare with me). I also had ordered a side of Karage as well. The karage was very good as well as all the chicken pieces were nicely fried but also very juicy. 

Interesting how the chicken karage pieces all came in balls, very round. Normally alot of times at other places karage just comes in some sort of shape. But here it is served rounded. Very funny to see but tasted wonderful. Definitely want to come back again to try other things on the menu. Can't wait until my next visit."}
{"text":"New trendy spot in NY. It's very flashy but not super snobby. When I called to make reservations for two (not allowed actually, but be 5 or more I believe), the person on the other end was really nice and gave me tips of when they get super busy and when it's not. 

So I decided to get there at 5:30pm on Friday evening (he was right, got seated immediately) and i ordered the corn ball app and the kake udon because it seemed so authentic and traditional. I was really happy with my udon dish (the corn app was a not as crispy as it looked though). The udon was chewy and the broth was delightful and not too salty. My friends udon, however, wasn't as good. She ordered the cream-based udon and after its cooking process, the udon became too soft to eat. 

I think, though, if you come, go for traditional rather than adventurous (fusion dishes)"}
{"text":"The good: creative idea for another izakaya type pop out in the north York district area. The one dish I was impressed with was their corn kakikage. But... That's about it...

The bad: I can't really say the bad, but everything else was just about average for me. I had the curry udon, which was meh (could be better or more impressive), chicken karaage (other izakaya are a cut above), and spicy salmon tartar is about average.

They ugly: I can't believe they sold out of black sesame purée udon with beef... On a Saturday night. This is actually the second time I have been here and it's twice they sold out of this dish. :( quite unfortunate

Neutral: I think this place is more suited for 2-4 people capacity. Big groups have super limited seating. Place is pretty spiffy in design (not sure how to define spiffy? Well that's how I imagine this place)."}
{"text":"I saw this place awhile ago but haven't had the time to go here until recently! This place seats maybe like 30 people roughly? It's a small place and the lights are dim so it gives a chill atmosphere haha. They don't seem to have a lot of staff... so calling them over can be a bit hard. 

The food is amazing! The flavor is so strong and delicious oh my godddd! I had the black sesame puree and wow it was black sesame alright.  It might have been a bit too much but I guess I misunderstood the word puree haha. My gf got the chicken curry udon and the curry was so good. Tasted like an actual curry instead of those ones you make from the packet. We got the pork belly and it was amazing haha! The flavor is deep with em and the green and onion slices omgg. 

For parking try to park across the menami place or park at shopping hopefully!"}
{"text":"This place is good for some hot soupy udon noodles. I seriously love the udon noodles here and can slurp it all day and I'm not even a big udon fan! The cheesy baked udon with seafood was also a hit. Delicious! Asides from udon, the pork belly and corn fritters were also really tasty. Everytime I come here I get those same items. This time we also tried the beef sashimi. It came out more like beef tartar, fully rare and seasoned wish an egg on top. Overall a great hit"}
{"text":"For those of you who looooveee carbs or who can't live without them, this is the perfect little spot for your ultimate twist on comfort food in the form of...udon. 

Straying away from the traditional udon noodles in soup, this place takes a creative twist in making things like the kake udon (udon in the form of a soba like broth) or the heavenly oven-baked udon.  

There are so many varieties of udon there that I wanted to honestly try all of them.  I honestly wish they had a tasting menu where you got bite sized bowls of each one.  At the end, I went with the oven-baked udon.  I would definitely highly recommend that one if you like carbs, cream, and cheese.  It was...heavenly.  

Do also remember to try their tapas.  The corn kaki-age was a cute savoury sweet dish and the king prawns were cripsy.  Definitely eat the prawns with their homemade sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Crispy king prawn is a must! My favorites for udon are the   Curry udon with shrimp tempura, salmon cream sauce udon and black sesame udon. The black sesame udon taste like the sesame drink powder that is not for everyone! I also tried their tako-wasa which is on the salty side, chicken karaage (meh), deep fried ika(basically okra sprinkle with salt and deep fried in a batter), corn kaki-age is good but I like the Thai version better."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never disappointed, love the corn karage, grilled eggplant and of course their udon. I preferred the soup udon as their cream version was a bit too heavy. Was expecting it to taste more like Guy Izakaya version but tasted more like alfredo sauce with cheese. Love the ambiance as it's a mixture of restaurant/bar/noodle house."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place but I was so disappointed as this was known for their udon noodle soup but there was really nothing special about their udon noodle soup at all.  I found the broth to be super fishy when I came here and I was not impressed by their side dishes, which were quite pricey and small in portions. I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and got the Corn-kage and the Oven Baked Udon aka the cheesy monstrosity. The Corn-kage was DELICIOUS and I'm mad it's only an appetizer! Meanwhile, the Oven Baked Udon was extremely boring even though it looked really heavy and cheesy. The noodle were thick and chewy but ya, don't get it. It's not bad but it's not the cheesy delight you're expecting."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend and who told me it was opened by the same owner of Han ba tang.

The restaurant had good service with some of the same staff that used to be at hbt, including the chef would did come over and chat with us about his inspiration behind the menu. 

The food included a mix of udons, dons and izakaya type dishes. We tried the black sesame udon, sukiyaki, pork belly, okra and a few other tapa dishes. Everything tasted great and I wasn't disappointed. I would specifically visit again to try the rest of the udon dishes as I thought they were really unique. They also had a good drinks menu which I didn't get to try but my friends enjoyed. 

The vibe was chill and definitely I think could work as both a nice date spot or with a group of friends

Overall, enjoyed the food, service, atmosphere and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow I was very impressed with this place. It was a Friday night where me and my friend where playing the usual game of \"where should we eat\" and my friend said Memami as an option. To be honest, I haven't heard of the restaurant before then so I was a bit cautious. But me as a foodie was like okay I'm going to give it a try. I was very overwhelmed when receiving the menu seeing that there was so much to chose from. After countless time speculating of what to order, I finally decided on the seafood yaki udon and my friend ordered the oven baked cheese udon. I was amazed of wow well it taste, The noodles taste very fresh and it was full of flavor. After eating half of my udon, me and my friend switched plates. I loved the Oven baked Udon even more! 

The restaurant was loud and cramped, but the amazing food made up for it. I will def go back to try out more of their other items."}
{"text":"Udon madness at MeNami! I'm always a sucker for noodles in the winter so I found myself visiting at least once a month. For my most recent visit, I got to try the corn kaki-age ($5) which was 5 fried corn nibblets with honey butter mayo. This is very unique and I actually really enjoyed it! I also tried their braised short rib one pot ($28) with a side order of udon ($3) to put in. The short rib literally falls off the bone and then melts in your mouth! It was delicious and cooked with pumpkin, dates and walnuts. Definitely worth a try! 

My FAVOURITE udon is the salmon cream sauce udon ($13). I don't know how they make their cream sauce but it's DELICIOUS! It doesn't taste heavy at all, and the piece of salmon is soft and melts in your mouth. My LEAST FAVOURITE udon is the spicy pork udon ($11). For MeNami being Korean owned, I was disappointed by this dish since it was kind of bland (not hearty). It didn't really stand out from the other udon creations. 

MeNami gets pretty busy, even on weeknights since it's right at Yonge and Finch. It isn't a big place and bigger groups would find it difficult in getting a table. Try to make a reservation to avoid the wait times! All in all, would I come back? YES!"}
{"text":"Yea, food is 4 at best. 
Place is a 4 at best. 
I asked one of the servers out. She said I'm a 4 at best. 

I'll still go back, great place for drinks and asian tapas eats."}
{"text":"Menami staff have the patience of saints. Many a time have my party arrived drunk, or out of control. The staff have always been accommodating to our outrageous demands, and our over the top rowdiness. 

The food is delicious but a bit pricey. The location prime as either Starting point for the night or a bridge for continuing the night. 

4/5 would return drunk or sober"}
{"text":"Music is so loud I can't hear that others are talking. Udon is ok. I ordered cream salmon, the salmon is a bit salty."}
{"text":"Fun ambiance (a mix of bar & noodle shop).
Great fusion food and affordable prices. 
Parking is difficult."}
{"text":"Located in the Yonge and Finch area Menami is a great Japanese Udon place. We arrived for a late dinner so we were seated in the bar area, and it was still loud, busy, and just hustling and bustling. Under the bar table there are hooks where you can hang your bags and jackets which is pretty handy. The front doors were unique, and looked like greenish copper doors with a very antique look to it. The Menami sign is very unique as well and reminds me of something from a broadway or Chicago musical lol

Udons:
For the udon we decided to try the Black Sesame Puree Udon with Beef and Oven Baked Udon. The Black Sesame Puree Udon was pretty tasty and was actually not what I expected! Although there was not a lot of beef It was nice and sweet with a rich toasted black sesame taste and I enjoyed it. The beef was good and garnished with red pepper threads and schichimi. The slight hint of spiciness that you taste when you bite into the tiny thin red pepper threads as you eat the sweet beef udon makes it fun and interesting to eat.

As for the Oven Baked Udon that was heavier and slightly more filling due to the cheesy Tex Mex. The sauce is very thick and creamy with shrimps and scallops. The scallops tasted clean, sweet, and fresh with a good seafood taste. The shrimps were fresh and big.

Tapas:
As for the for the sweet tapas we decided to try the Corn Kaki-age which I loved! I love corn, and I love fried things so it was really the best of both worlds. I did wish there was more corn bits though. But overall the honey butter mayonnaise paired well. As for the fritter it was made with just the right amount of fried batter and was not very oily as well.

The Albacore Tuna tataki was served with wasabi, soy sauce, green onion, green onion oil, and seaweed. It tasted pretty fresh and soft. Don't remember much about the smoked salmon with parsnip sauce so it was probably just okay.

The torched saba was a pickled makarel with grated daikon and green onion. The daikon and the green onion is served separately on the side, so you have to add it to the top of the saba and eat it together. Tastes good if you squeeze some lemon juice on it as well.

We decided to wash it down with some Nama Nama fresh sake, and Takura Plum Wine. Both paired well with the tapas and hot udons.

Between the udons and the tapas, I would have to say I enjoyed the taste and experience of eating the udons more. I like the combination of ingredients that they use for the udons, the chewiness of the udons, and the presentation of it. The presentation of the tapas was great, but in terms of uniqueness and overall tasting experience the udons definitely win. 

This place is definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Great location, good vibe, great staff, tasty food. I knocked off 1 star for their price point as they are definitely on the pricy side compared to their competitors and the spacing is tight. One small nuisance is that their music plays at different volumes constantly."}
{"text":"I like the potato cream udon. It is so different from what I had. The fried corn appetizer is highly recommended too.

Their cocktails are pretty good and look amazing."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Toronto NEEDS an udon place!

But meh. 

I've only been once and am willing to go again to try something different. But their udon soup dishes were only ok. The soup/stock needs some improvement. It's weak. 

But I'm willing to go back and try their \"pasta\" dishes like their creamy udon dish."}
{"text":"I don't get why udon has not reached the same phenom heights as ramen because IMO it's just so much better. Disclaimer, my review might be biased because I love udon so much but Menami hit the spot for me. 

We started off with the fried corn balls, grilled pork belly, Hamachi and chicken karage. Corn balls were delicious; pork belly was so, so but the accompanying pickled onion made up for it; Hamachi cooked well and a good basic; but the slightly dry chicken karage was underwhelming and a pass. We also had the eggplant which I LOVED. Grilled tender atop a tangy, sweet sauce and topped with mounds of crunchy strings of sweet potato it was probably my favorite starter. For the udon we got the black sesame beef, salmon cream and a kim chi soup. Starting off, the noodles on all three was springy and chewy just like good udon should be. Of the three though, the best was the creamy one which was rich, decadent and a total treat. My second favorite was the black sesame but my dinner companions didn't enjoy it as much. If you've ever tried chinese black sesame dessert it tasted like that on top of udon. Slightly sweet, it was a unique taste which I didn't mind because I also love black sesame but definitely not for everyone. My least favorite was the kim chi soup udon. It tasted more or less like broth with Kim chi and lacked the spicy depth of traditional korean kim chi soups and for me didn't translate well. 

The portion sizes were decent for the price although the amount of protein in each of the udon was quite small. I docked one star off for the so-so starter, udon protein quantity and the inconsistency between udon quality but I would definitely come back. I'm not sure I would go out of my way or recommend as a must try, but if you like udon like I do, then definitely give it a go!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 5:45pm on a Friday night with many of the tables already reserved and we were able to get a table before the rush of hungry customers came in soon after. Decent and attentive service. Ordered corn kakiage - sweet and delicious corn niblets fried to crunchy goodness. The mayonnaise sauce that came with had a nice sweetness to it - yummy! Spicy salmon tartaré, yummy and fresh pieces of salmon. Sukiyaki had thinly sliced beef with good amount of fat cooking in the broth. The Sukiyaki pot had napa cabbage, onion, different types of mushrooms and glass noodles. Additional add-in: udon noodles ($3). 
Satisfying dinner on a cold night."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype for Menami. We came on a Saturday night; the ambiance is nice, service was average, but the food was subpar. 

They offer house made udon but the noodles were not special and the sauces were lacking in flavour. We got the mentaiko carbonara and tsuke udon, both lacking in flavour. The carbonara completely overtook the mentaiko taste, and it felt like they cheaped out on the amount of mentaiko. The tsuke udon was not enjoyable as the dipping soup did not make the dish tasty - lacking in umami flavours all around. I expected their noodle dishes would be well done - being an udon specialty restaurant -  but they were not. 

We also got a few appetizers, we remember them being okay but the mains were so disappointing it's not worth mentioning the apps. I think a lot of people come here for drinks and the apps. 

Although the appetizers were okay, the udon was not worth it. I would not recommend or come back."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. Tried real udon in Japan and this doesn't even compare. The soba is bland and doesn't have much flavour. I also found my noodles to be too undercooked and hard. Their broth is also too fishy, for my taste. Tried both the cold noodles and hot noodles in soup and didn't like either. The cold noodles also had seaweed, which added to the fishy taste. Also tried the fried chicken and it was ok but it had some fat/tendon and the batter was very eggy. I wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend today. We were greeted right away. 
I loved the decor of the place, I thought the turquoise chairs and the barn wood tables creates a chic/ rustic style.
We ordered :

Corn kaki-age, like so many reviews already on Yelp, yes, it is delicious!!

Korokke ( I like how they spelled this on the menu..) with wayyyy to many k's haha.. 
It is so crunchy outside and divinely smooth and creamy inside.. It was exactly what I wanted on a rainy day:)

Mentaiko cream sauce udon was indeed \"creamy\", but perhaps too thick for my taste. It taste a bit like Alfredo sauce. The flavour was great though! Expect to smell like garlic for days after this udon hahaha...

Overall, liked the atmosphere and the service. Enjoyed the tapas more than udon. Will definitely go back for tapas maybe with a pint of beer also:)"}
{"text":"We arrived around 6pm on a Thursday and there were already a good number of tables filled. Luckily we seem to have beat the rush and were seated right away (when we left at 7:30 there were three parties waiting). The decor is stylish, but also confusing with a lot of random garage sale like items all over the place. There are antlers on the wall and old fashion scales. But really, you don't come here for the decor (the atmosphere however is jumping), you come here for the udon. We decided to start our meal with the grilled eggplant and fried calamari. The eggplant came with a mysterious sauce that tasted like a sweet fish flavoured soy sauce and lots of bonito flakes. It was wonderful and I would definitely order it again. The calamari was the real winner of the appetizer battle though. The squid rings was tender with a light crispy coating and dusted in powdered seaweed. There was something about the blend of all the flavours that seem simple, but kept me coming back for more. Then came the udon. My dining companion and I both got tsuke or cold udon. The dipping sauce comes with grated daikon, ginger and green onion on the side so you can customize, but the sauce is so good that you really don't need it. The tempura shrimp were good, but basically like any other shrimp you'd get anywhere else. The noodles were the real standout of the dish. They are homemade and you can really tell. They taste of the sweet flour that went into it and have a wonderful chew to them. As we sat, we saw plates of cheesy udon and other delicous plates go by and vowed to come back."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and they're always very busy. Better come here on an empty stomach because everything is very filling! Every time I come here, I always have leftovers to take home. 

My favourites are the salmon cream udon and the oven baked udon. It's super creamy and cheesy. For appetizers, I really enjoyed the crispy king prawn, albacore tuna tataki, beef tataki, beef sashimi, spicy salmon tartare, and ricota fries. 

I've also tried the tako wasa, fresh fried okra, chicken karage, mentaiko cream sauce udon and the black sesame puree udon w/ beef which were just okay. The black sesame one was kinda weird in my opinion, since it reminds me of asian desserts. The chicken karage wasn't bad, but guu/kinka izakaya does it sooooo much better. 

The ambience here is pretty nice, it's filled with a bunch of young adults grabbing drinks and socializing or digging into the delicious udon and tapas dishes. It's kind of loud in here and the lighting of the restaurant is on the dimmer side (not that I mind) but it's definitely a little harder to take pictures of your food haha."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and feel. Trending hip hop music playing. Tables a bit too close together and ours was a very wobbly table. I was super excited at the array of menu items featuring mentaiko, but my main dish still left something to be desired. We ordered:

-corn app
-wasabi octopus
-mentaiko udon
-mashed potato croquette
-original udon 

Based on these items alone I wouldn't come back. The corn has a nice texture but was a bit too heavily breaded. The butter-mayo was unique. The wasabi octopus was mild in flavour which was disappointing. The mashed potato was actually really nice - it was soft and smooth inside with a crunchy breaded shell.. with a delightful dipping sauce.. lots of flavour. Probably my fav dish out of everything we ordered. The mentaiko udon was very disappointing for me - the usual saltiness of the mentaiko was drowned out by the sheer amount of cream sauce. All I tasted was buttery cream. It was too too heavy and I could not finish the plate. The original udon was nothing special. They had orange slices in their water pitchers but there was no hint of citrus in our water so I think this is moreso decorative. Their receipts have precalculated tip amounts for 15, 18 and 20%."}
{"text":"Totally recommend this place! Great place for Udon during the day and drink at night!!

This crispy shrimp is awesome! They are gigantic paired with the house spicy mayo sauce is to die for!

The Chicken- Kara-age with or without true tartar sauce is awesome, full of flavour and not too much batter.

The beef Tataki was sliced too thick.. Didn't really work out for me, a little bit too frozen for me.

The calamari taco Yaki udon was amazing, cleaned the plate in a matter of seconds!

The Mac and cheese style seafood udon (oven baked) in a stone pot was perfectly stringy. Jus the perfect amount of butter and cheese.

Braised Short Rib portion was kinda small for the price, but definitely tasted good, 1 order wasn't enough to go around for our table, but definitely worth ordering round 2.

Props to the seafood udon soup base, even though it was MSG

Drinking and eating atmosphere was great, the girls are cute and he bar staff are friendly. My drunk friend kept of taking selfies with the waitress all night and they were cool with it!

Come here and look for Ethan or Dk, they will take care of you!!"}
{"text":"Oh no another Korean guy feels like he must open a 'Japanese' restaurant and give it a Japanese name. This one is a udon (noodle) restaurant that charges for the udon that is \"artisanal.\" We found the udon too coarse and grainy.
I know it sounds funny but the owner might have hit a concept. Who knows? I mean look at Momofuku where (yes another restaurant with a Japanese name that serves something else) charges twice the typical rate for noodle dishes. 
Anyway, since the demise of Bushi Udon and its Danforth predecessor there isn't a dedicated udon restaurant in Toronto that I know of,  but still Tokyo Grill and Fin Izakaya have better udon, at cheaper prices and keep it pretty real to the real thing.
Oh it is easy to forget that service is also subpar because one is so focused on the inauthentic udon. At least try to offer something close to Japanese quality service. 
Joke of the day: Mexican Flavour udon"}
{"text":"My husband loves udon everything and MeNami happens to be known for its extensive udon selections! 

We started off with their corn fritters with honey mayo and chicken karege. The corn fritters are a must get - 5 giant golden, crunchy balls of awesomeness! A bit of savory, a bit of sweet - the perfect starter! Chicken karege - I infrequently order these in restaurants just because they tend to be either overly battered or overcooked/fried (to jerky level). But MeNami's were meaty, juicy, yet managed to preserve the crunchy exterior! Couldn't get enough! 

Onto our mains! As part of their lunch special, all udon and rice dishes were served with either a side salad or soft drink. The side salad was a simple salad (some lettuce and some cherry tomatoes).

Baked seafood udon - creamy, cheesy, pure indulgence (aka a definite calorie bomb lol). Chopped bacon, scallops, shrimp beautifully folded within. Although it was beyond delicious, it was a very heavy dish. Unless you don't want to save stomach to try anything else on the menu, I recommend splitting this dish. 

Tempera udon - served with two shrimp, one pepper, one sweet potato tempera all were perfectly battered and fried. Another solid classic dish. 

Nabi yaki udon - before I had a chance to take a bite, my husband had already eaten all his noodle and drink his soup. Someone was satisfied. 

Overall - couldn't get enough! Can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Lets just say out of all the kinds of noodles, udon is my least favorite up until I went to this place. I checked the other Yelp reviews first before coming here because like I said, I'm not really a fan of udon and Im really glad that I did. Most reviews recommended the baked udon. It is basically like a japanese version of mac and cheese with seafood. Damn it was delicious! It had the right amount of cream, cheese and yes seafood such as scallops and shrimps. I cant wait to go back to try their other take on udon. And now I am officially addicted to udon!"}
{"text":"4.5/5. 

*Same owner as Han Ba Tang. 
*The owner sent the Head Chef Kevin Shin to Japan to learn the noodle making technique. They even imported an udon machine directly from Kagawa to create the most authentic and traditional udon experience for the customers.
*the restaurant also offered a good selection of sakes and Korean liquors, thus ensuring that there is definitely something for everyone here.
*Their Thai Ice tea was incredibly good. The drink consisted of a robust tasting black tea mixed with evaporated milk and topped with fragrant shredded coconut. The overall tea was surprisingly not sweet at all. 

-Smoked Salmon with Parsnip sauce: Thick slices of fresh sashimi grade salmon were served at perfect temperature - yum! The highlight of this dish was definitely the parsnip sauce which complimented the salmon perfectly with its own sweetness.

-Oven Roasted Yam Salad: Loved how the greens were not overly drenched with vinaigrette and the sweet yam had a caramelized coating to it - delicious.

-Udon Chicken Salad: I admit, I didn't think I would enjoy this salad at all but the white sesame sauce really brought everything together. The salad was refreshing and served chilled. 

-Albacore Tuna Tataki: The albacore tuna meat was soft but firm, slightly seared and was incredibly balanced with the punch from the wasabi to a light touch of saltiness from the soy sauce. The dish was light yet flavorful, a great way the start the meal.

-Deep Fried Ika: Each calamari piece had a light, crispy and delicate coating and the squid was incredibly tender. For that distinctive green tinge to it, seaweed was incorporated into the batter to add a slight touch of saltiness to the calamari.

-Corn Kaki-age: I think I found my new food addiction, it's called Crack Corn - I mean Corn Kaki-age. It's dangerous stuff. Yes, this really was essentially fried corn, but these corn fritters were crunchy and not greasy at all. I didn't think the honey butter mayonnaise were even necessary here as the corn niblets were quite sweet already, nonetheless these were highly addictive.

-Beef Tataki: I didn't enjoy the beef tataki as I thought the Jalapeno was quite overpowering.

-Tsuke Udon: I was quite pleased that the udon noodle at MeNami had the perfect chewiness and firm texture to it - I can no longer eat normal udon.The cold noodle dipped into a properly made sweet soy sauce with grated ginger, which had just enough spices to coat the udon with a tingle of flavor. I can imagine this dish would be popular in summer as the udon was quite refreshing and is enough to combat the heat.

-Kitsune Udon: So simple yet so good. The slightly-sweet marinated tofu provides a nice contrast to the gingery broth and the kick of fresh scallions.

-Spicy Pork Udon: I believe the broth for the spicy pork udon is similar to the Kitsune one, however this was definitely spicier - the heat didn't linger in my mouth though - and the pork was well cooked.

-Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon: Udon in Carbonara sauce? Where have you been in my life! The chewy noodles were evenly coated in a rich bacon-infused cream sauce and topped with generous amount of marinated cod roe which gave the udon that salty and briney touch to it.

-Black Sesame Puree Udon with beef: Loved how they incorporated the black sesame with udon - which resembled squid ink pasta. There were also a decent amount of spinach and thinly sliced beef mixed in, and the spiciness from the red pepper and schichimi powder balance the sweetness of the black sesame. Though the dish was definitely unique, I didn't enjoy it as much since the black sesame sauce was on the sweeter side and it was almost like eating a dessert. I much prefer the savoury options when it comes to udon.

-Parfait (green tea ice cream, red bean, corn flakes, whipped cream and pocky sticks): it felt quite short for me as the dessert was incredibly simple. However this is an udon-speciality restaurant and as you can see, they excelled at it so I didn't expect the dessert to be stellar anyways."}
{"text":"This place is Korean. Stay away from beef Tataki. One of the worst.  Got spicy Salmon don. Its hwae Dae bop. 
Decent place if they more known as Korean. Atmosphere trendy"}
{"text":"Great place to go to if you're willing to experiment with Japanese food and try something new. I had the Cheese Baked Udon and it was delicious (Cheese, bacon crumbs, shrimp, and udon noodles). The customer service is great! Overall a great place to eat at. Great atmosphere and vibe."}
{"text":"Love this place! The vibe, the food the service! Their sake!! Its not a typical Japanese restaurant. This place is an experience! Love their oven baked cheese Udon is a must have! Be careful it's served super hot!  Their Corn Caki-Age is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch! 
Had the corn kaki-age, seafood Yaki udon, and the spicy pork udon! Would definitely recommend the corn kaki-age as other reviews mentioned - the sauce is really good with the corn! Also the seafood yaki udon was very satisfying - good portion and proportion of udon vs seafood (mussels, shrimp, calamari, and squid tentacles). 

Service was great and the environment was nice and clean. Overall, would come again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Underwhelming food. Be prepared to pay $10+ for very disappointing udon."}
{"text":"Place was rather mediocre. The udons were not anything spectacular or out of this world. It was decent. Cheese udon is just fattening, not delicious. The appetizers are better than the udon main dishes however. 
Staff was friendly, but not to the point where I would give menami another chance."}
{"text":"This is a new Japanese restaurant in North York, by the same owner as Han Ba Tang down the street. We were seated at the bar and had a chance to chat with the chef. The waitresses and chef are attentive and gave us some good recommendations on food and drinks. The black sesame udon here is a must try! We also ordered the sukiyaki and a couple small appetizers to share between four ppl. The sailormoon gone wild cocktail drink is refreshing and light but a little bit on the pricy side. Overall great food and good vibe, will definitely come back to try other udon dishes."}
{"text":"I split the Corn Kariage and the Chicken Karage with a friend and thought both tasted great ! Loved the corn kariage :) ..It was a bit pricey, but I enjoyed it. I also had the Sailormoon Gone Wild drink, which was okay. Not as magical as I thought it would be. Their soups come in huge bowls, which my other friends had and looked delicious."}
{"text":"The udon was tasty with a nice mouth feel. I had the kake udon with chicken thigh and it was yummy. They say that the udon is made on site, but I couldn't really tell a difference from the frozen udon from the Korean grocery store down the street. My partner had the black sesame udon and got sick of the flavour really quickly.  Neither of us could finish his dish. The servers were nice and we had water refilled without asking. The pace of the meal was nice. No complaints, but I wasn't wowed either. Don't know if I would come back for more, but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Been disappointed with Menami lately. For my birthday on Jan 10th we had a newb waitress who would take someone's order then suddenly disappear for a few mins before coming back to take another person's order. It was super irritating. It took forever getting our meals. My family wasn't too happy with that and they are generally quite agreeable. My brother said he doesn't want to come back again. 

Last Friday Feb 17th, we walked in around 7:50pm and waited in line. No one greeted us and my friend actually ended up writing her name on the list. They were clearly understaffed and the hostess was busy but did keep checking back to make sure everyone was still around etc. We were standing there for 20+ mins when she then told us there were many reservations and a table for 4 would take forever. Wonderful. Couldn't you have told us this WAY before?! I love the creamy salmon udon but I don't know if I ever want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Craving Udon last night and ordered the spicy pork one, take out. Love the decor of the restaurant. Very unique. The menu is extremely interesting and the service was very efficient

The udon tastes superb!

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came here 4 times and am an absolute fan of their udon and tapas. Their menu isn't extensive but I love that they offer a creative variety of udon and delicious tapas. I'd highly recommend their original tsuke udon, very light and refreshing. It's cold udon that's served separately from soy sauce with ginger, sesame, green onion. Aside from the tsuke udon, I always order the stone fish roe rice which is marked at an extremely low price for the portion. I'm usually not interested in squid but I had their deep fried ika here and it was amazing!! The squid was unbelievably tender with a thin layer of batter surrounding. I'd recommend the crispy king prawn and corn kaki-age. Order the drunken matcha tea as well!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere.  Seating comfort was average.  Service was friendly and menu was simple.  If you are there for socializing it's great with a hip atmosphere.  If you are there for food, in the end its just udon noodles.  Nothing that special that you can't make at home."}
{"text":"The food is OK, some unique options, the service is not good, the ambiance is great! We got there 40 min before their closing (based on yelp and their website) and the server wanted us to leave, because they were slow on that night and she said they close earlier when they are slow. Which can be an inconvenience to the customer. I tried their noodle and couple of other dishes, and liked the noodle the most. Creamy salmon noodle was really great! My friend ordered black sesame one and that was also good."}
{"text":"Loved it! There's a variety of udon flavours, with a new modern twist to some of them. The tapas was good, we ordered the Crispy King Prawn-which had a great spice to it. 

Salmon cream sauce udon was really good, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The black sesame pure udon with beef was unique and delicious.

Service was quick but after we ordered they didn't come by to check on us-we had no water throughout the meal.  (Kind of odd when they had more than enough staff)"}
{"text":"Udon noodles here are salty. But all the appetizers are amazing. Very good. The corn and the tartar is amazing. Worth trying. But Udon soup is very very salty."}
{"text":"I havent had a good meal in a long time! Finally menami hit the spot! 

The place has an awesome decor, wooden tables , root chandelier and chalk board menu this place is so hip!
Anyway the door and the signage are both cool too. 
Food:
You get to. Choose from udon, rice bowls, shareable soups, and tapas style (more like izakaya)
We had the seafood udon, it was dressed like an okonomiyaki which i really enjoyed. 
Oden. Nothing bad here pretty traditional stuff.  It was ok. 
We had the corn kakiage, reminded me of the corn puff snacks. Pretty cool
Takowasabi is the usual  flavor ...generous with the nori! 
Saba, a bit on the bland side but still alright. 
Had the tuna tataki, this was really good, it presented well and the seaweed salad was a refreshing. 
Over all i would come back. This place is kinda small so reservation would help."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner and was surprised at how nice the interior was. I mean the wood tree like things on the ceiling were so cool and the floor has different shades to it. 

To start off, I ordered the corn kaki-age and I got addicted right away. By the end of my dinner, I had ordered 3. I also had the cream udon and it was absolutely fantastic. One dish that I wasn't crazy about was the salmon tartare. The thing burned my mouth pretty good. 

Overall, great addition to the Yonge strip. Loved everything about it from decor, service, and food. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"MeNami is a fine place for a meal after work, if you work up at Yonge and finch area. 

I enjoyed my meal there. The prices are not bad and the food is tasty, though nothing mind blowing. There are certainly no shortage of Korean restaurants to visit in this neighbourhood, and i would consider MeNami to be above average.

Recommended."}
{"text":"I've tried about five of their udon dishes and some were better than others. My personal favourite is the Baked Seafood Udon! It has melted cheese on top of shrimp and scallop. Next I would say is the Salmon Cream Udon; and then the Kitsune. I wouldn't recommend the Yaki Beef Udon, the soup tastes like diluted soya sauce. And the Black Sesame was a bit too sweet for what I would want as a main dish. 

Their appetizers fare better than most of the udon. Definitely order the pork belly. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"They have some really interesting stuff here! I love coming here to meet with friends or just dine by myself. The decor is very modern and food never disappoints. It can get busy during dinner time. The service is always fast and friendly.

For the tapas, I've tried the corn kaki-age, eggplant, and beef tataki. All their tapas are pretty tasty so you won't go wrong with anything. My favourite is the corn kaki-age though. Try it, you won't regret it!

For the udon, I've tried the salmon cream sauce udon, seafood udon, curry udon with tempura, and the original kama udon (cold). The salmon cream sauce udon is my favourite out of the bunch. It's not too creamy and the salmon melts right in your mouth. I just wish the salmon piece could be bigger. The original kama udon was pretty forgettable and that I won't order again. Next time I'd like to try the soup udons.

Their Thai iced tea and matcha tropical latte are also very good and refreshing.

They open late too which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the tonkatsu... Definitely get the curry ! Costs about $13. Also try the corn kaki-age $5. Pretty good! It's like a deep-fried corn ball. 

My friends really enjoyed the udon so definitely worth it. 

You definitely need reservations. Otherwise you may have to wait a bit. 

Staff is great and atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"We went to Manami for dinner and ordered the curry udon with shrimp tempura and the seafood yaki udon. The atmosphere was quite chill with a mix of an upbeat sports bar feel with K-pop playing in the background. The service was excellent and efficient. The curry udon was average, typically sweet as boxed Japanese curry but with a hint of spiciness.  The udon was amazing, extremely soft and chewy. We really enjoyed the seafood Yaki udon - a moderate amount of seafood in the dish with a rich, savory  sauce.  We would go back again."}
{"text":"Not your typical Japanese resto. That is the first thing you should know. Tons of menu items are destructed or constructed very differently from your average and that is what makes MeNami outstanding. Come here if desire quality but admire experimentation and the art of food. With that said, ask before you order so you are delighted instead of surprised when your plate arrives! Go someplace else if you're looking for a cookie-cutter Japanese menu.

I've only had positive experiences but I'm here with a specific purpose: to rave about the corn kaki-age. This stuff UNREAL.

It is heaven-perfected corn tempura served with what tasted like honey mayo. It was buttery, decadent, crispy but not too crispy. I'm reading other reviews on the corn kaki-age being mediocre and I wondering if we ate the same thing. It is one of the most satisfying and unique starters I've ever had. Do not skip out.

The restaurant itself is a work of art, it is rustic but modern. Only great vibes here."}
{"text":"The noise level is ok. Definitely a good place to hang out with friends. If you have more than two, it's better to make a reservation before you go there. 

I'm not a Fan for Udon, but they really provide quite a range of selection. It was hard for me to decide which one to order since I used to just choose between yakiudon and tempera udon at other restaurants :/

We ordered corn kaki-age(must!), crispy king prawn, roasted hamachi Gama(pan fried yellowtail neck), spicy seaweed Ankake Udon and Tsuke Udon. These are a little too full for two ladies though. I will for sure come back again for their sake and tataki :)"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Yonge St and Finch Ave E. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
The hostess, servers, and the bartender were all amazing. Our drinks came promptly, and the servers checked on us throughout the night. 

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Modern, hip, and chill bar vibes. I really enjoyed sitting in their patio. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
All ingredients tasted high-quality and fresh. The noodles in the Udon dishes were all cooked perfectly al-dente. Definitely worth the price. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Red Sun - $10.00: sweet and slightly tangy with a hint of lime. Doesn't have a strong alcohol taste, but it was deliciously refreshing. 

- The Swan Song - $12.00: this one has bitter undertones, and is great for those who don't enjoy really sugary drinks 

- Ricotta Fries - $8.00: fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! The creamy Ricotta cheese and fresh cherry tomatoes complemented the fries very well. 

- Seafood Yaki Udon - $13.00: Savoury, multi-dimensional, and my favourite udon of the three we ordered that night. 

- Salmon Cream Sauce Udon - $14.00: Creamy, subtle, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. 

- Black Sesame Puree Udon with Beef - $15.00: Sweet, rich, and tasted like a Chinese Black Sesame Paste dessert mixed with udon. Very fun to try, but I think the black sesame flavour was a little too sweet to be paired with this savoury udon dish. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
A great place for dinner and drinks. The only setback was that the black sesame was slightly too sweet in the Black Sesame Puree Udon with beef. Other than that, the fries, cocktails, and udon were all delicious and exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time about two weeks after a friend suggested it. Great location on Yonge St and close to the Finch Subway. Nice selection of Sakis and imported beers. Service was very good and the food is very fresh and flavorful.  Definitely try the Chicken Karage, its bursting with flavor. I live at Spadina and Front, but will definitely be coming back here again, if you do live in this are its worth checking out."}
{"text":"MeNami is a really great Japanese sake and udon bar by Yonge and Finch. With the large light up sign and big green front doors, you literally cant miss it in the evening. 

At around 8pm on a weekday, the place was already packed with people so my group of 2 sat at the bar. The atmosphere is loud, dimmed, and lively. 

I had a tsuke udon with shrimp tempera with corn/age and my friend ordered a fried chicken udon with this warm sake (forgot the name). The fried corn with the dipping sauce is great! The tsuke don was not bad as well. I do think portions were small but maybe that was just my order since the other udon bowls around us seemed pretty big. 

Service is alright. The girls are always running around but theres a plus sitting in front of the bartender who seems nice and took orders and cleaned up while not making drinks. 

The decor is super cute. Pretty hipster-y and similar to HBT."}
{"text":"Had pretty high expectations as well but it was only alright. 

Suggest they should have a uni cream one, makes it more special. I would suggest the tsuki dipping udon which is kinda chilled but is the correct chewy-ness. The price was really reasonable but sorry just didn't find it that special. 

Salmon cream was alright but uni would have been better imo. I remember the udon place in Hawaii being really good and left me with a craving to come back. This place just didn't seem to have that."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday lunch and wanted to try their expansive udon menu. I always walk along Yonge street and pass by the starry-lit MeNami sign and have always wanted to check the restaurant out.

Once we were seated, I studied the menu a bit before deciding on the Seafood Yaki Udon. On the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the Tonkatsu meal set. The corn kaki-age has been something I've always wanted to try, so I ordered a plate of that as well.

Before our mains arrived, the server gave us each a bowl of salad. It was quite refreshing and tasty. When the mains were served, I initially fell in love with the sweet aroma given off by the udon, reminding me of takoyaki balls and  okonomiyaki. The udon noodles were sitting in a thick sauce with mussels and morsels of squid, all topped with bonito flakes and mayo. I was a huge fan of this dish. It was the star of my meal. Not only was it rich and flavourful, but the mussels themselves gave off this smoky flavour that really complimented the savoury sauce and noodles. 

As for the pork katsu, I thought that they made the dish really well. The meat was tender and not dry at all, and the exterior coat was very crispy. The sauce for the dish was tangy and sweet. 

The corn kaki-age was satisfactory. I found that the corn fried with what looked like batter gave it a chewy texture inside, which contrasted with the crunch you got biting into the kaki-age. I did, however, love the sweet sauce they gave us to dip the bites in. 

Overall, the meal was amazing and I loved the service that they provided to us."}
{"text":"This place has truly changed or perhaps we came in on a bad night. Was here on Friday night, decided to grab some food as we love the udon. 
We felt uncomfortable from the moment we walked in. Got greeted by a hostess or server and got a seat, the music was so damn loud we had to literally scream at eachother to have a conversation. We order a couple of beers and the corn appetizer. 
After the appetizer we thought of ordering an udon soup but were weary of staying due to the loud and obnoxious EDM/dupstep music. We finally flagged down a server and asked her to turn the music down, in which she did.. until the manager who seemed to spend most of his night on an iPad choosing his playlist turned it right back up again. 
At this point we just got the bill and go out asap. 

It's a shame that the place turned into a club. The food is so great and so WAS the atmosphere. Unfortunately probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It's just not that great. Their 'handmade' udon actually tasted very similar to those frozen Korean/Japanese udon you can get from Asian grocery stores.. I know they probably did make them in house.. but to be quite honest, if you were going to advertise yourself for handmade udon, please do yourself a favour and differentiate your udon from frozen packaged udon.  
Personally wouldn't want to spend $15-$20 for something I can make at home. Also their soup base tasted like those instant Daishi powder....

Pretty disappointed.

Let's be logical here, just because the chef learnt how to make udon in Japan... that doesn't automatically make their udon the best in town... 

Ambiance: 4/5
Food: 2/5
Service: 3/5
Value: 2/5"}
{"text":"An udon house with a variety of good dishes at a reasonable price. The place has a hipster, industrial vibe and seating is limited - best to have a group of 4 and under. Visited multiple times on weekend lunch without a reservation and it was often a 10-20min wait. The draw of this place is the sanuki udon, which is made in-house and really springy. They have traditional dishes but I find the \"contemporary\" ones more fun, especially Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon and Seafood Yaki Udon. Oven Baked Udon satisfies mac and cheese cravings but is obviously very rich. For shareables, the Corn Kaki-Age (deep fried corn clusters with a buttery mayo sauce) was pretty interesting

Dishes are around $8-15 for an alright portion size. The service itself is fast and the owner is really friendly and always checking in to make sure everyone's having a good time."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner today. There's street parking right beside the restaurant so that was convenient.

Corn Karaage ($5)
Corn niblets fried in tempura batter, served wth honey butter mayo on the side. This tasted really good - essentially it really is just fried corn. I don't even think it is fresh corn off the cob either, just canned corn. Although it was tasty, it felt greasy and heavy. Quite expensive for what it's worth considering they only gave 5 pieces, each piece was small too. 

Black Sesame Puree Udon with Beef ($15)
For those black sesame lovers, this is a must try! This dish was definitely unique. It's the first time I ever had Black Sesame as a puree served as a sauce to go with udon - it was very delicious. The udon was drenched in the black sesame puree, which was sweet and pastey. The was also a decent amount of spinach and beef mixed in - the beef was thinly sliced, not over cooked and flavorful. Loved this dish.

Seafood Yaki udon ($13)
Originally i was thinking this will probably taste like the typical chinese fried seafood udon style, but to my surprise it was a lot more flavorful. The ingredients were fresh, a fair amount of seafood including squid, mussels and shrimp which weren't the typical frozen shrimps but big ones! The mayo added on top was key - it gave the dish a more japanese touch. 

Prior to coming i was thinking, how good can udon really be? So coming here with no expectations really made my visit extra enjoyable. Service was good too. Definitely would come back to try the other udons!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table here and when my friends and I arrived they only had half the seats I requested available and waited a long time. They had fake blood on the windows I leaned against it while I was waiting. I told the waitress she didn't apologize ( I mean it's not her fault so it's fine I guess ) all she said was \"ohh okay\" awkwardly said \" it just food coloring it will wash off.\" And we all know food coloring stains are really really difficult to come off. So I spoke to the manager and he's like \" it's just fake blood.\" So they did nothing about it. After we got our table we saw at lease 3 more customers getting the fake blood on their clothes and purses. In my opinion they should have offered to pay for dry cleaning. the minimum they could have done was stick a warning sign saying \" wet paint/blood do not lean.\" Especially after I complained about it they should have put a sign up to prevent more customers from getting their clothes stained."}

{"text":"Great decor and vibes. We had the:

THE ORIGINAL TSUKE UDON- Flavourful broth (was my favourite dish)
SPICY SEAFOOD SOUP- Also a great broth just the right spiciness...except they didn't clean the shrimp so it had a unsettling taste
BEEF TATAKI- small portion, it tasted great but I don't feel its worth $12 for this dish at all
SALMON CREAM SAUCE UDON- we ordered this but it never came so we just cancelled it, womp womp.
NAMA-NAMA FRESH DRAFT SAKE - this sake was great, would definitely recommend it. Its not sweet or too dry.

This place is also the same owner of Han Ba Tang ...I definitely will be coming back here to try other stuff off their menu. Overall this place has great potential to take over the North York bar scene like Han Ba Tang is."}
{"text":"Perfect place for udon or tapas lovers. So many different types of udon dishes to choose from (they also offer rice dishes and hot pot if noodles aren't your thing! This place gets extremely busy every weekend dinner, you should make reservations if you're thinking about coming here for dinner. They also have an extensive drinks menu and the bar has lots of options to choose from. Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We were quickly seated and ordered our food. The service was fine, nothing bad and nothing spectacular.

We ordered:

Kama Udon - chewy Udon paired with some delicious dashi broth. The portion is bigger than I'd expected. It was a great bowl of Udon on a cold winter's day!

Cheese Baked Udon - HUGE portion for the amount of Udon and cheese you get. It gets filling real quick! The portion size come with decent amount of perfectly cooked shrimps, scallops and bacon! Unless you're starved, this dish is best for sharing or expect to pack some leftovers home!

While we're eating, we were already planning when to return, it's just that good! I highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Originally I had plans to go to Joey's for my birthday dinner, but I changed my mind last minute and decided to check this place out (since everybody's been talking it!). I thought hey, it's a Thursday night..there probably won't be that many people. So I didn't make a reservation. Boy was I wrong. It appears that someone else is also celebrating their birthday here too! Luckily, we came early and got a seat at the bar area.

The seafood yaki udon was good, but not amazing. It was a bit dry and not as flavourful as the curry udon with shrimp tempura. The curry was sooo flavourful, MMmm! A little bit of spice but not overly spicy. Make sure you dip the shrimp tempura into the curry sauce before you eat it - it's SO DAMN GOOD! 

I also had the Yuzu Mojito - pretty good, but I didn't like the Yuzu too much. Reminds me of the Yuzu water drink my mom made me everytime I had a sore throat. I would have LOVED a regular mojito. 

Overall, the vibe is pretty awesome and fun. The food was great, server was amazing. I'd so come back, but I'm not paying $11 for the Yuzu Mojito again. Only because I'm not a fan of the Yuzu."}
{"text":"Udon was more Korean style than Japanese, it was just ok. Cocktails and chicken karaage was great. I must acknowledge the servers, they were polite and attentive."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE udon - it's my favourite type of noodle, so I was super excited to come here and experience the deliciousness! And it was indeed, delicioso!

Management: We arrived around midnight and was seated promptly since it wasn't too busy on a Thursday night. We got menus and water right away and there were coat hooks - which is much appreciated since the chairs weren't big enough to hang our coats on without it touching the floor. For some reason though, they dimmed the lights after we ordered - not sure if that's for ambience but I think I was the only one who noticed lol.

Cleanliness: very rustic feel with the interior design and I love that! Table was clean and the place looked well-kept.

Service: the server was polite and took our orders on an iPad so there shouldn't be room for error. In addition, the apps came within 5 mins of ordering and the mains came shortly after - not sure if it's because it wasn't too busy but I was still very impressed with their speed!

I enjoyed the following:

1. Corn Kaki-Age ($5):
This was fried dough balls with corn in it and a honey butter mayonnaise - this was very popular in the Yelp reviews so I got it and it DEFINITELY isn't good for you, but I needed that in my life - was crunchy and tart and opened up my appetite for my udon! Try it!

2. Salmon Cream Sauce Udon ($13):
I love salmon and cream sauce so this was a no-brainer! First off, it comes with green onions and sesame seeds usually but I dislike both, which is why it might look like it lacks colour. I believe the salmon was done with a sous-vide which is a tool used to control the temperature of cooking, so the salmon was firm on the outside but tender on the inside - it was amazing! I prefer my salmon a bit undercooked so if that's not your thing, this might not be for you, but you MUST try it! The cream sauce has tomato oil in it, which is a new combination for me, but it gave the sauce a unique aroma that made me devour the udon without leaving a trace!

3. Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich Green Tea with Raspberry Macaron ($5 for one):
I've had this in LA once when I visited little Tokyo there and it was fantastic so I decided to try this special menu item. Unfortunately, this wasn't as good as the one I had in LA. The macaron itself was dry and dry and dry :( the green tea ice cream was basic so nothing impressive. You can try this for yourself just for the Yelp, but I will not get this again.

All in all, this udon place gets a good rep for their udon for good reason - it's just so slippery and firm enough that your chopsticks don't break them when you enjoy. If it wasn't so far away from me, I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their hand made udon. Also tried their beef rib soup (for two) with the option to add on udon and it was PERFECT for a cold night. Amazing customer service, a middle-aged woman (possible owner?) came over and helped us stir the soup as well as point out main ingredients, it was a very nice homey touch, 10/10 would come back just for the beef rib soup."}
{"text":"Came here about 2 weeks ago for lunch ( 2nd visit).  Ordered the Tex Mex Cheese Udon with shrimp, scallop, and bacon and the Albacore Tuna Tataki.  Both dishes were excellent!  The service was quick and attentive.  Will definitely come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"A nice cute restaurant. I think their appetizers are definitely things to try such as the takowasa, okra, squid and corn."}
{"text":"Food here was okay. It was something different compared to other places I have been dining in at. The chicken Kararage was pretty good but overpriced for a small portion you get. The Salmon cream noodles were good, but not something I would like to have again. I will be going back to try their seafood soup for two!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner when it was a hot day so I had the chicken katsu udon! The portions were good and the place was neat and urban. It's s fun place to come from time to time."}
{"text":"Those big green doors and bright yellow lights are definitely an eye catcher to passerby. It definitely caught my eyes and I finally got a chance to go beyond those doors to see what it's all about!

Heads up: definitely make reservation when you have a big group unless you're planning to eat earlier than 6pm. The restaurant fills up pretty quickly so, it's better to be safe than sorry! I made reservations for 5 people however, due to the seating arrangement it was pretty cramped. The table was meant for 4 people and they added an extra chair to accommodate the 5th person... this place is just not the best for large groups I'd say...

As for food, we ordered several dishes:
1) Corn Ka-kiage: Recommended by many Yelpers and indeed, it was very tasty. How can you go wrong with deep fried corn dipped in a sweet & savory sauce?!
2) Tako-Wasa: Raw octopus is something that you don't come across on every menu. The octopus was very fresh and has a good amount of wasabi in there. Not too overpowering, just right. It tastes good as is or eaten with the seawood as it will give it a bit more texture. Best thing about this stuff is that it is only around 3 bucks!!! 
3) Convection Pork Belly: I must say.. aside from the delicious pork belly, I really really REALLY enjoyed the pickled onions. The pickled onions eaten with the pork belly definitely brought the flavour out. It's a bit greasy but, when eaten with the salad, it helps make you feel a bit less guilty. 
4) Grilled Hamatchi: O.M.G. and I thought hamatchi sashimi was bomb. This grilled hamatchi was truly amazing. I enjoyed every single bit of it. So tender and the best thing is.. it barely has bones or fat! (Unlike grilled salmon!) MUST ORDER!! You won't regret it!! I was not much of a fan of the turnip puree it came with though. Quite bland and didn't add much to the dish..
5) Kitsune Udon: Quite disappointed with the udon I must say. Perhaps, I did not order the right one..? I had such a high expectation for the udon since I've heard many amazing things about it. However, this one let me down. Soup was very plain; tasted like soy sauce and water with a hint of ginger. Udon was tender however, its texture and taste was nothing out of the ordinary; very similar to the frozen ones you get at a supermarket. The fried fish-tofu piece was alright, nothing really special; it did have a hint of fishy taste though... 

As for drinks:
I ordered the Geisha and it's such a pretty drink!! Very fruity and refreshing. My friend ordered the Matcha Druken Tea and I tried a bit of it... not sure what to make out of it. At first it tasted like soap... I guess, it's best to say that it's an acquired taste?

In sum, food was great. Vibe and service was good. Will come back to try out their other udons and rice!!"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was terrible. The server (I believe her name was Yeri) had the cold face starting from when we walked until we left. She complained to us about not giving enough tips, kept asking us if there was anything wrong with her service. Tips are not mandatory but are based on the quality of service provided. She even said that herself. She also said that \"Chinese people give 10%+ tips) but we are not Chinese so we don't understand what was the point of saying that. She threw the receipt on the table and left our table saying \"shame on you\". Even though the foods were delicious, my friends and I will not go back."}
{"text":"Good food. Not much variety to choose from the menu in terms of appetizer or entree. Food was a tad over priced. Overall good good and good service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this restaurant that has consistent good quality. Love the decor, but I do feel the menu is a bit overpriced for what you are getting. The corn kaki-age is one of the most popular appetizers, and it is pretty tasty, but I actually prefer the fried squid with seaweed which is lightly fried and not too heavy. The udon itself is nothing special compared to handmade udon in Japan, but is higher quality than your average Japanese restaurant udon. They also have more creative choices, though I feel like they overdo the creamier udons like the mentaiko and the black sesame flavours. My favourite is actually the Nagasaki udon which is a light spicy chicken broth base with seafood. Their hotpots are pretty good too and you have the option of adding udon for an extra charge."}
{"text":"This review is based on 2 visits to MeNami. Both on a weekday Tuesday, one during the hype when you need a reservation to get in anyday and one when you can drop by as a walk in on a weekday.

I like the simple menu of MeNami. An unique menu that differs from all the Izakaya/restaurant in the area.: Their star is the housemade udon. 

I like the freshness of non frozen udon. Yes there is a difference. A subtle different. But if one is paying the same price for a bowl of packaged/frozen udon at other restaurants, why not go for the fresh one with no preservatives? 

I tried the Original Kama Udon ($7.95) and Tsuke Udon with Shrimp Tempura ($10) both which I really enjoyed. I would say just skip the Tempura as the udon is really the star of the dish. 

For Tapas, I tried the Corn Kaki-age, Roasted Hamachi Gama, Tako-Wasa all really solid dish.

For drinks I would suggest to stick with beer (they have Delirium on tap) or Sake. Their cocktails is sweet and weak.

Service though was exceptional during my most recent visit. Both waiters were nice and went out of their way to make sure I have a good time.

I would be back for some more fresh udon. I think this is the only restaurant that offers freshly made noodle in GTA."}
{"text":"As a kid, udon to me had always seemed bland, boring, and uninspiring - yet somehow MeNami has managed to turn it into a fun and delicious food item, so props to them. 

I honestly didn't even care that much about the udon, the main thing I wanted to try here was the corn kaki-age because as I can't help mentioning like all the time, I do love me some corn. The dish was $5 off their tapas menu and came with 5 pieces of deep fried clusters of corn kernels. Honestly, the dish was delicious, the corn was very sweet, and the honey butter mayonnaise added an extra bit of delicious sweetness. So good, but did seem a bit pricey given the portion size and the fact that the dish seemed like it would be so simple to make.

We ordered the oven baked udon ($14) and the black sesame puree udon with beef ($15). The texture of the udon was honestly unlike anything I've ever had - it was chewy, I guess the udon version of pasta al dente, and I really enjoyed it. The oven baked udon is pure comfort food - like a Japanese version of mac and cheese with tons of cheese, as well as shrimps, scallops, bacon, green pepper, and onion. It's definitely a very heavy and filling dish though.

The black sesame udon was very interesting. I could definitely taste the black sesame flavour, but didn't think it mixed well with the rest of the dish, because there was a slight sweetness that was just weird. Other than that there was nothing special in it, just clumps of beef. I honestly think this dish is a bit gimmicky and would not order this again.

I thought the service was good, as our food came fairly quickly. We had no problems getting our bill and they refilled our water once while we were there. Honestly we were in and out of that restaurant in less than an hour. 

Came around 6:30 on a Wednesday night with a friend and luckily we didn't have to wait at all for a table. By the time we left about 40 minutes later though it looked like there were about two groups waiting. I wouldn't mind coming back here to try other things."}
{"text":"Made a reservation as recommended by other yelp reviews, and glad I did! This place was busy for a Wednesday night! Our group ordered the popular dishes- salmon cream udon, baked udon and the black sesame udon. The sauce of the salmon cream udon tasted a bit like alfredo sauce. The salmon itself was nothing too special.  The black sesame was sweet, but not too sweet. The black sesame udon was my favourite out of all three. Definitely need to be a fan of black sesame in order to enjoy this dish. The baked udon is good, but similar to what others have said, it is VERY filling and VERY cheesy. Only order it if you really, really like cheese! 

We also ordered the chicken kara-age, which was pretty average for fried chicken.. nothing really stood out about it. Its still good though. In addition, we ordered the corn kaki-age, which was really tasty and different from how I'm used to eating corn. Its a good change and worth trying, especially since its only $5!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Japanese resto from home. Food is quite ok, will try more next times."}
{"text":"Smaller portions but unique food Japanese style tapas. The creamy salmon udon and baked cheese udon was delicious. For apps the fried corn is a must try!"}
{"text":"Trendy udon restaurant near Finch station!

It's really walkable from Finch station, and the outside has huge doors that you can't miss! The decor is really trendy and stands out compared to a lot of other restaurants in the area. It has more of a cafe-look than a regular restaurant.

There isn't a huge variety of food here - they specialize in udon pastas. The first time I tried MeNami, we got a regular soup udon, and their mentaiko cream udon and weren't too impressed. I also tried their corn kakiage (due to reviews) but I wasn't a huge fan of it.

But I came again the other day and tried their salmon cream udon and loved it! It was a reasonable price ($14?) considering it had a pretty big piece of salmon. It was really filling on its own and we didn't need to order any appetizers or anything. I'd want to try their oven baked one (shrimp and bacon) or the tempura and curry udon next time!

It's not really a place you'd go to regularly, unless you crave udon a lot, but it's a great place to go catch up with friends over food!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to go to MeNami cause I prefer udon over ramen. Since MeNami specializes in udon, I had my expectations set pretty high. The udon according to other Yelpers is supposed to be \"handmade\" but I honestly couldn't tell the difference if it was actually handmade or from the package. I've been to other udon shops internationally, and the quality of handmade udon is unmatched by packaged udon (-1 star).

MeNami has 3 types of udon: soup udon (left side of menu), cold udon (top right), and baked udon (bottom right).

The soup and cold udon is pretty standard and the same that you would see at any Japanese restaurant. One soup udon of note is the curry udon which my friend had and it smelled delicious.

The baked udon is more unique and I would definitely try one these. My friend ordered the salmon cream and I had the black sesame. Between the two, I actually prefer the salmon cream over the black sesame. Black sesame is definitely more unique and worth the try, but its a little on the sweet side for me. I would recommend trying the salmon cream as it was just pure creamy deliciousness infused with salmon!

We also ordered a few tapas (beef tataki, salmon tartare, albacore tataki) - all very standard Han Ba Tang portions, quality, and taste. The salmon tartare is on the smaller side though, so order some other tapas if your ordering it.

Service is prompt, attentive, and friendly and it's super easy to make reservations by phone. If it's the winter, make a request to sit in the back of the restaurant since the tables at the front can get quite cold when the doors open. I think menu items are reasonably priced.

Overall, it's a good restaurant and worth the try. I would come back if my friends wanted to try it, but there's so many restaurants in Toronto that I would probably choose trying a new restaurant than coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here around 6 times - they get pretty busy during weekend nights but I generally never have to wait for a seat on weekdays. The ambiance is classy/chill/cosy. 

Nagasaki udon - MUST ORDER. I only ever order this now and whoever I'm eating with always wishes they listened to me and ordered this instead after trying mine. This udon soup cannot be more perfect. The soup feels clean and light, but still explodes with umami flavours and has just a kick of spice. Comes with a generous amount of octopus, shrimp, squid, mussels, etc.

Curry shrimp udon - this dish tasted a little too heavy for me. Curry flavour is good though and the tempura was done right.

Spicy pork udon - this was a fail for me :( the spiciness just tasted like pure spiciness, not the flavourful umami kind of spiciness that I like and was expecting 

Spicy salmon tartare - an excellent appetizer that I would totally order again. I wish the portion was bigger but the salmon:chip ratio is acceptable haha

Corn kaki-age - deep fried balls of corn. I enjoyed this but woulda liked it more if it was fried in a flat layer instead of a ball!"}
{"text":"MeNami lives up to the hype. After closely observing the patterns of reviews on Yelp, I have safely concluded on the number of dishes we should sample at the restaurant. 

DEEP FRIED Eggplant ($6)
Eggplant, Green Onion, Hana Katsuo, Sesame, Deep Fried Yam, Karashi-Su-Miso
Roasted soft texture of the eggplant, contrasted with the crisp texture of fried yam, immersed in an addictive miso sauce. 

Chicken Kara-age ($6.50)
Chicken Thigh, Shiso Mayonnaise
Typical deep fried chicken goodness with a delicious Shiso mayo twist. 

Original Kama Udon ($7.95)
Kamaboko, Wakame, Green Onion, Tenkatsu
The flavour of the broth is nothing out of the extraordinary. The texture of the udon is definitely better than its supermarket counterparts. Overall, it is good opportunity to sample fresh udon that is no air-sealed or frozen. 

Thai Ice Tea 
Coconut Cream, Thai Ice Tea Powder
Pass. Save your money for another tapa!

Overall, MeNami is a great place for delicious pinterest perfect dinner! Can't wait to try other fresh udon!"}
{"text":"Back for more!! This time around I went back to menami for dinner time. Wednesday at around 6pm. Place was already pretty busy, they had about 4 tables seated already, in a place that's not that large. By 6:30 it was almost at full capacity. I can imagine this place getting much busier in the summer (they do have a patio).

Anyway, probabaly best to make a reservation if you can.

This is one of the several (might I say few) trendy places to eat in the Yonge and Finch area. They specialize in Japanese Udon (would like to say fusion but \"fusion\" is so cliche). You can get dishes like creamy potato Udon (looks kind of cool, wonder how it tastes), Salmon very Udon (an Alfredo sauce udon with Salmon fillet on top) I'd day this is the best value, Sefood udon, spicy udon (for those cold days), and then more.

The corn fritters are pretty popular, but I personally don't like them that much, but almost every other table got them. I'm more into the tako Wasa (octopus) as a snack.

I also appreciate that they served Kronenberg, which is a plus.

The restaurant is on the louder side, so it's not much of a place to have a deep and insightful conversation. But I'f you're looking for for a chill place to hang with some decent music, and good food. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Horrible service. So called fresh udon certainly wasnt impressive. Limited options that werent deep fried. Not returning."}
{"text":"For dinner I had tempura-udon but my new favourite is the corn kaki, very delicious! Next time I'll try other tapa dishes ~"}
{"text":"The cold noodles are a little lacking
Very busy at night
Service good down a little during that time"}
{"text":"Mediocre service but good food and nice decor inside. They've added a nice deck outside (that could use a few plants!) which is also a good option."}
{"text":"I've been three times the past week and i'm addicted.
I've only had the simple dishes like the Beef Udon w/ Bonito soup base (12CAD....its EXCELLENT) and the Beef Short Rib (29CAD for 2 ppl) with side orders of udon at 3CAD each.

the appetisers are all a bit on the small side (especially the spicy salmon tartare) but i really love the udon here, which is nice and chewy."}
{"text":"With so many aspiring places to become the next 'ramen' joint, MeNami really brings udon to the culinary light. It was good, though not amazing. There are many different combinations though, the one I had was not amazing. The soup was very salty and tasted like salt and soy sauce.

My fiance definitely picked the better main dish, the spicy pork udon. It was delicious and she was drinking the soup, something very unusual for her behaviour.

Our favourite dish between the both of us was definitely the chicken karage that was super crispy and delicious. I do wish the sauce that they brought it with was spicy. Definitely needed a kick!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Noodles are chewy and bouncy, full of flavor! Particularly recommend the spicy pork, Texas bake or the salmon cream.

Unfortunately, we had terrible service. To be fair, we did go with ten people; however, despite making the reservation a week in advance, they did not have the staff to accommodate us and it seemed as if they were dodging our table and avoiding taking our food order. They took our order an hour after we were seated and food came about 20 minutes later. My friend ordered a beer which never came, despite all our other various mixed drinks being served half an hour later. After kindly reminding the waitress about the beer, another half an hour later it finally arrives, along with the waitress who finally took our order. 

Will I go back? Sure, but only on a good day when I have the patience to wait!"}
{"text":"Just writing this makes me crave their corn kaki-age. 

Walked by this place during the summer and saw quite a wait outside so didn't get the chance to check it out till now. This place reminds me a lot like Han Ba Tang just down the street actually.

Was told by my fellow Yelp Elite friend that they were known for their Udons so decided to try their Salmon Cream Sauce Udon - it was HEAVENLY. Salmon was cooked to perfection and the sauce was so good! Ugh whoever is reading this needs to order it when they go.

My friend and I were also looking for an appetizer to start and our really nice waitress suggested their most popular corn kaki-age - 4~5 big deep fried balls of corn bits with a mayo sauce. So so so amazing. Reminded me of the flat fried corn sheets they serve in Shanghai actually.

Drink selection was also great, friend had the Delirium on tap and I had their 'Sailor Moon Gone Wild' cocktail which was yes, you guessed it, also amazing. If it was a weekend, we would probably each have gotten a flight or two of sake as well.

I enjoyed this place much more than Han Ba Tang based on the type of food offerings and atmosphere. I am for sure going to come back a few more times and check out other items on their menu seeing all the awesome dishes being pumped out to our nearby tables.

This place was quite busy and not that big so I'd suggest attempting to make reservations beforehand!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spot! I come here way too much but I love the food, simple yet tasty! From their starters to all their udons!"}
{"text":"Love the corn appetizer here. The sweet potato salad was tasty too. As for their udons, it's not bad but wasn't too different from the frozen udons at the grocery store"}
{"text":"I've been to MeNami on numerous occasions and the quality of the food is consistently good. Prices are reasonable for dinner and portions are adequate. The menu has variety but it doesn't consist of too many choices that would make you indecisive. I actually prefer the appetizers over the mains. 

The Salmon Cream Sauce Udon was good, not too salty, but definitely heavy (as any of the cream dishes are). I also forgot I was lactose intolerant so this probably wasn't a good choice for me to begin with (my bad!)

The Okonomiyaki Pancake was delicious and a larger size than I expected. I kept picking at this dish throughout the meal. It tasted good even when it was cold! I would recommend this and the Smoked Salmon Tataki for sure. The Corn Kaki-age was unique! I think I would just come here and order all appetizers!

They have quite the selection for drinks and the cocktails are beautifully made. My friend and I sat at the bar on two separate occasions (I love watching people make drinks). I remember the bartender made a drink 2 or 3 times. He kept pouring it out and re-making it because the taste wasn't up to his standard. This is the type of quality that makes them stand out."}
{"text":"This place is small but the decor is stunning. Got lucky and was seated right away but I definitely recommend making reservations as the place can get very busy especially for dinner time. Had the Black Sesame Udon and Potato Curry Cream Udon. Most amazing flavours that I've ever experienced and the udon was very soft and fresh. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu ! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wasn't mind-blowing but I think this place was alright! They were out of a drink we wanted to try, unfortunately, so we had the seafood yaki udon, the tempura + cold udon, and the chicken karaage all to share. 

The seafood yaki udon tasted great - the sauce is simmered long enough for the seafood flavours to really infuse into the sauce - but the udon was overcooked. The tempura was decent and the cold udon was nice - cooked just right, so that it was chewy. The chicken karaage was nice - crispy on the outside, succulent and juicy on the inside - and the aioli it was served with was nice.

All in all it was a solid meal, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Very over rated. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat and they sat us right next to the kitchen with the boilers and stovetop right in front of us. This should not even be a seat for people, it was extremely hot and there was always traffic, waitresses literally reaching over you to get food for service. I ordered the tempura udon for 11.50. To me this was a giant rip off, it came with one measly shrimp, a slice of sweet potato and a piece of green pepper that I didn't eat because when the tempura coating came off it had black and brown spots on it ( I'm assuming it wasn't very fresh). The broth didn't taste like anything special, and the udon tasted like the frozen packages you can buy at the super market. To top it all off it wasn't very hot- unlike myself. I was extremely disappointed with this place. I am never going back."}
{"text":"From the unique ambience, various sake and alcohol, and specialty udon, Menami delivers a casual yet cool experience with deliciously creative dishes and very friendly service. 

After entering through the large wooden front doors, you're senses are greeted by antler-looking fixtures, a truck front grill, and whitish-grey wooden chairs. If it isn't too busy, you should get seated quickly. 

I had the amazing smoked salmon with parsnip sauce tapa appetizer. As for the udon, I've tried the tempura udon and mentai Ankake udon. The noodles were quite chewy and soup was light. There were many kinds of udon to choose from. 

Menami is great for lunch or dinner preferably in small groups. Evenings are great for enjoying drinks and upbeat music."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good. I came here with two others and the place was full on a Tuesday evening. We gave our phone number and they told us they would call in 30 minutes, give or take. We didn't wait for the call and came right when 30 minutes struck and the gentleman said he was just about to call us...not sure if true or not based on one of the more recent reviews. We were seated and had a female server. I ordered the Chicken Kara-age and Yuzu Mojito. 

The chicken was decent. Fried, hot, what you'd expect. Well worth the price tag. The Yuzu Mojito could have been better....it wasn't as strong as I'd hope it'd be, and yuzu bits kept getting stuck in my straw. Luckily, I sampled my friends' dishes. They ordered Corn Kakiage and Spicy Salmon Tartare. The corn was sooooo good. It was my favourite appetizer of the night. Crunchy, along with the natural sweet corn taste and tart of the sauce was a perfect combination. The spicy salmon tartare's portion was really small, but it definitely packed the flavour. Not worth it though, in my opinion. I also tried the Oven Baked Udon and OH MY GOSH. Cheese lovers and udon lovers truly unite in this one dish. It is the perfect marriage between the two. I wish I got this for myself.... Last but not least, I tried the Salmon Cream Sauce Udon. It was good, but not as good as the Oven Baked Udon in my opinion. Obviously, I have my bias as a cheese connoisseur. 

Service was okay. The server seemed to fill my friends' waters but not mine?"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of udon, this place is a must try. Coming here for the second time, I knew what to expect: a hip interior with loud music and every udon combination you can dream of! 

I was a bit turned off by how loud this place was the first time I came for dinner but I'm happy to report that during the day, the noise volume is considerably quieter and it's easier to have a conversation with your significant other. 

As a starter we got the tako-wasa (seasoned octopus) which you can wrap with seaweed. A nice refreshing start to the meal! 

This time I went with one of their most popular items, Salmon Cream Sauce Udon, after reading all the wonderful reviews on Yelp. This dish is indeed very creamy. The addition of tomato oil definitely helps cut through the creaminess and prevents it from being too two dimensional. The salmon was also cooked perfectly, very tender and moist. In the end, though, I had trouble finishing this as it was almost too creamy. 

My boyfriend got the Oven Baked Udon which was so good. I love cheese but didn't want to get this myself since it seemed a bit much but the few bites I did have were delicious. Worth trying from time to time!"}
{"text":"Was here a while ago on a Friday evening. Didn't have a reservation and was too hungry to wait for 30min. This time we made reservation for a Saturday 6pm, it was pretty empty but filled up after a while. The udon dishes were solid, we got curry udon with shrimp tempora and a soup udon with beef and mushrooms, both were tasty. However, the music was too loud. If that kind of ambiance is your thing, then you would enjoy this place more."}
