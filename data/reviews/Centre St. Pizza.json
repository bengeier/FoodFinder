{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this small unassuming pizzeria. I needed to order a couple of pizzas to bring to a potluck and was going to pop by a well-known national chain, but I thought to check on Yelp to see if there's anything else and this listing got my attention.  I ordered a cheese and a wild mushroom pizza and was completely wow'd.  The crust is the right amount of thinness (my brother compared it to Famoso) - the chewy, stretchy, thin kind. Toppings were just enough to get it with every bite.  Prices were extremely reasonable for this quality - I think another reviewer mentioned artisan style? I will be back - and I will try the other variations too! Was very happy to support a local business!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 stars because this pizza place gave me a confirmation that the shadiest places are the places with the best food. It was a little past 10PM and my friends and I still hadn't eaten dinner yet. The only place nearby was this pizza shop in a very ghetto plaza, where all the stores next to it were closed. I have never eaten such good pizza. It was loaded with cheese and the crust was THE BEST crust I've ever had. I have never felt such way toward a pizza  crust until i had the pizza here. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Let me know if you can find a Calgary pizza that's located outside of DT, and willing to deliver during lunch ;)  Hard to satisfy corporate DT clients, as parking is a huge premium.  This location is run by the husband, who's pretty helpful when it comes to catering value.  Just mention your budget.  Their double toppings for pepperoni & cheese for just $22 10\" is a deal.  With their size, it's geared towards takeout/delivery.  Clean corner location with lots of side street parking but not on Centre Point for obvious reasons.  Amex ok too."}
{"text":"A Perfect Pizza is the best! Service is always prompt and friendly, and the staff are very attentive to your needs. The food is delicious - not just limited to the pizza. The wings are wonderful also. If you're ever craving pizza, it's the easiest place to just come in and order from. They also do delivery. Definitely would recommend to any pizza lover."}
