{"text":"It's true the garden patio is beautiful and the front window area is quaint and lovely but the food is sub-par.  The creamed soup basically tasted like the flour they thickened it with and the salmon was fine, but really quite tasteless. If you \"dine\" in TO you are getting used to all kinds of different spices, herbs and combinations of veggies with every new restaurant.  Definitely a downer for me.

Although, they have a FANTASTIC corkage fee, only $10 per bottle!"}
{"text":"The patio looked nice and inviting but that is like a Venus fly trap luring in it's prey. The food was terrible. Unless you like loads and loads of pepper. We started with green salad-lettuce was nice but loaded with pepper. One of us had pasta which had almost no flavour - except of course for pepper. And the mussels - which didn't have pepper - were left almost untouched. Toronto has a lot of great restaurants so we suggest you skip this one."}
{"text":"The Balsam boasts the best back garden patio in the Beach. A beautifully designed space where every inch has been designed to perfection. The space is relatively small, yet provides an intimate setting in which to enjoy the many culinary delights the kitchen makes a habit of putting out. We enjoyed a plethora of varying appetizers, from mini sliders, to crab cakes, to sauteed shrimp skewers, to rare sirloin slabs with a beautiful homemade Montreal steak dipping sauce. The food was plentiful and came out with rapid fire efficiency. 

We were fortunate enough to celebrate a friends wedding at the Balsam and found the staff attentive, knowledgeable and more than hospitable. A contemporary fine dining experience void of the ostentation that can typify such an establishment. 

Simply put, dining at the Balsam is like eating in your friends backyard, with better food and ambiance, while providing all the comforts of home.  A must stop spot."}
