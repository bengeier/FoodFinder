{"text":"Had craving for vietnamese food so decided to give this new place a try and benefit of doubt after reading all the 1 and 2 star reviews.     We ordered a beef stew on rice and it was like a Hong Kong style borscht soup.  It was not a stew, more like a corn starch concoction. I was very disappointed but my brother ate it anyway because did not want to waste it.   The beef brisket was fatty too.     The pork chop, chicken and beef vermicelli was only so-so.    The only thing that was good was the mango slush.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Tired. Hungry. I just wanted wonton noodles next door but they were closed on Wednesday. This was the closest and easiest option. While eating, I cursed myself for trying. When I left, I was ashamed to have eaten and paid for such poor quality food. For the authentic part. I don't even want to talk about the food. What a nightmare. This is not a Viet resto. Stay away. Don't make my mistake!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater that has gone to many places to eat. And I must I'm really impress for the quality of food!   We ordered a Vietnamese noodles and green curry chicken.   The noodles soup was authentic, though could be hotter. The noodles and raw beef were on point!   The green curry was very very tasty and hot (I'm a weakling).   Overall, my boyfriend and I will definitely return for food!   One less star for the not hot enough soup....."}
{"text":"Love the pho here, it's not like other restaurants where you're going to need to drink a lot of water after. It's a great price for such a big bowl of pho, cheap and tasty. Orders come quick if ordering pho, if ordering rice it will take slightly longer, but not as long as other restaurants I have eaten at. Always go here for pho."}
{"text":"Literally nothing special.  Restaurant is very quiet and empty, even so our service was slow and food arrived late.  Everything tastes ok but soup could use more flavour.  I'd say the bowl comes with quite a bit of noodles even for a medium size (thought i don't see a small size?) and there's quite a few variety of soups including satay, tomato, five spice."}
{"text":"Good phó and even better chili oil, spicy and the perfect aroma for phó! If you're craving a good large bowl of phó at a great price, this is the spot. Their broth was decent, meat was a good portion but their chili oil is what got me to give them 4 stars. I swear if they made this chili oil and sold it I would buy it all the time.   Unfortunately they don't take credit card, only cash or Canadian debit cards ONLY so make sure you come prepared!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese restaurant with a menu that's only in English and Chinese.  Food: 2/5 Broth not very flavorful. Service: 3/5 Very slow for pho. Environment: 4/5 Meh. Washrooms: 4/5 Quite spacious Worth it?: 2/5 Better Vietnamese places around.  Decided to give this place a try when we were in the area. A Vietnamese place with no Viet on the menu should have been a clue it wasn't going to be that great. Everyone decided to keep it simple and got pho with beef.  Being a simple dish to prepare, I was assuming the food would be out in around 5 minutes. That is usually the case when I order Pho anywhere else or even go back home for some of the families secret recipe. We ended up waiting well over 30 minutes.  The soup broth wasn't clear like northern style pho, nor was it flavorful like southern style pho. It was overall disappointing.   What made the whole experience worst is that when I ended up paying for the bill, the lady at the cash rounded me up to the nearest 5 cents even tho I was paying by debit. I wasn't going to say anything over 2 cents but I was not impressed and will never come back here. If you are scamming people for pennies, I wonder what else you are cutting corners on. I almost want to make it a 1 star just for that."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great went here in the morning. Service was extremely slow ! Tables are really close together and the place is small, Would not come back."}
{"text":"It's not bad (but I had better). Pho noodles are softer than other pho restaurants.   I ordered a satay beef noodle, tomato beef brisket noodle and a chicken wrap. My favorite was the satay beef noodle and chicken wrap.   It is a nice take out place, I called ahead and when I arrived 10m later everything was ready.   When i went to pick up 7:45pm, the restaurant only has one table of two and they were getting the bill."}
{"text":"For some reason my dad loves this place for their pho and so does my family, I guess it depends on personal preferences? I don't really like the broth, it almost tastes artificial but not a good msg artificial, it leaves a funny after taste.  The main reason I give this 2 stars is because of the service. They give you dirty looks when you don't tip (i know many asian restaurants do that but im not giving you a good tip if you're not deserving of it ?). There was even an instance where my parents and I sat down but they told us they were out of pho and were about to close?? Excuse me???   So yeah, not my favourite pho place"}
{"text":"I've been to many pho places and this is my favourite by far! Every bowl is very full and they don't skimp out on meat like some of the other places. I always get the medium and can't even finish it. We also tried their curry fish balls and they are amazing as well.  My mom and I come here all the time and love it! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"My least favourite pho place by far. Not only was service slow, the staff appeared to be flustered and hard to get a hold of. It wasn't that busy but all the tables were full and half of the tables were already served. They had trouble with the debit machine as well which added to their frustration.   The broth while super hot tasted more like boiling water than a beef base broth and although there were los of noodles and toppings, I think the price is a little high given the lack of flavour.   I don't think I'll be returning only because there are other places that offer much higher quality food and service."}
{"text":"Location: it's located in a convenient spot where all the nearby restaurants are and the t&t restaurant in the same plaza. Therefore, you do not need to worry about parking since you'll always manage to find it.   Food: it was a cold winter evening and we were just looking for a bowl of warm and hot noodles for dinner. We stumbled in this place and lucky for us, there was plenty of tables available no wait.  My husband ordered the regular bowl of pho with rare beef, brisket, flank... The regular... And I ordered the satay noodle soup.   For one size bowl--they were really generous with the quantity of beef slices for both his and my order.  It was a huge size ( not like your regular s, m, l to choose from).  They get the stars for generosity of the amount of noodles and meat proportion.   However, their pho noodle soup base was really lacking in the flavor. It was really bland. Sadly, it didn't satisfy my craving for a tasty, flavorful bowl of broth.   My order of satay beef noodle soup had a surprisingly different flavor than how I imagine satay should taste. It tasted rather like a Tom yum soup ( because it has a sour kick and a bit of spicy notes). Errrrrr, I don't think I would have ordered satay soup of I knew it would end up tasting little like Tom yum. I can't say it's a full Tom yum broth.... But I may have expected a different flavor.  I do prefer my really flavorful broth more than the bland pho noodle soup.   Thank you for your generous amount of meat though!! It is very much appreciated!!"}
{"text":"Came here again after a long hiatus .. Hoping it had gotten better, got the pork/ spring roll vermicelli - pork was too dry and flavours were lacking. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, after I sat down and got comfortable in this clean, comfortable and.. empty establishment, I checked in on yelp and saw only 1.5 stars.. what? It's plain rude to just get up and walk out, especially when you're their only customer.. so, I stay put and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Good choice! 3.5 stars in total.  The place is comfy and the service was stellar, with a very nice asian lady running the place. She was very nice and made sure everything was ok- drinks, seats and everything else. I ordered the satay beef noodles and I was very satisfied, even though the satay tasted more like a less sour tom yum soup. Still very good! The serving was huge for $7.99 and it was just delicious; the noodles were chewy and tasted amazing. There was so much beef in my bowl that it was endless and I had to give some to my boyfriend because it was simply too much for one gal to finish. He ordered the lemongrass chicken rice and indeed it was tasty! Not bad at all.   I certainly do not believe this place deserves only 1-2 stars! Good food, good servings, good service- it's not my favourite place to eat for sure, but I'd definitely come back if I'm near by. Parking is kind of crap.. so many restaurants and random places opening up in this area and the way they designed the parking lot makes me want to cry. The turns are horrific and there are singular spaces created by blocking off concrete.. I'm so confused! Place some bad (usually asian) drivers in the area, looking for a spot to go lounge at T&T or cha me cha and you've got yourself a nightmare.  Ps. pho mi? Hahahaha"}
{"text":"Pho Mi 88..originally we were not planning to eat here.. we wanted to go to their neighbour Wonton Chai but unfortunately they were closing and not taking anymore business so that's why we ended up here...   At first, I was excited to try this place as I really luv viet food...and am always looking for new places to try...  It's a new place so the atmosphere was clean and new.. when we sat down at our booth..the menu was placed down with tea.. we realized the choices were so limited...there were probably less than 30 items to choose from...I'd always order the viet spring rolls becuz I personally believe this is how I can judge if they make good food or not...and drum roll please.... epic fail....pieces were so little and doesn't taste like viet spring rolls...   We ended ordering the special beef noodle pho... we were literally able to count how many pieces of beef were in there... and the soup base was extremely bland... tasted like water...for heavens sake, at least use some campbells chicken stock...   Nope I'm not coming back until so positive reviews..."}
{"text":"We planned to go to T&T to shop for groceries and decided to have lunch before we went.  So saw a pho place and decided to give it a try.  We were quickly greeted by the hostess.  The place was very clean.  Even the bottles of sriracha and hoisin sauce were spotless.  We got the menu and was surprised how expensive everything was.  Well too late to turn back now so we went ahead and ordered a large pho with rare beef and golden curry beef brisket.  I thought everything we ordered tasted pretty good.  But the price point was high up there.  Probably won't go there again unless we happen to be in the area we were starving."}
{"text":"I've been here only two times but based on my most recent visit it has definitely improved a lot. It was probably the best pho I've ever had in Markham. The beef was nice, tender and juicy, the soup base was very good and they gave us lots of pho. Worth a visit if you are craving Pho in Markham for sure  Food 4.5/5 - I ordered a large bowl of pho with rare beef. The beef was actually rare when it came to me (good thing) which meant that by the time that I ate it, it was not overcooked like it sometimes is at other pho places. The beef was also very soft and tender, so the quality was pretty good. The pho tasted great and the soup base was very flavourful. The chilli oil here was also pretty spicy and added a nice kick for a spice lover such as myself. Overall it was very filling.  Service 3.5/5 - Service could definitely be faster, but it is not terrible. There is only one waiter working at the front, so wait times can get bad during peak hours. Service was good otherwise.  Price 4/5 - Compared to other pho joints I think this place was just a little more expensive? However I was very full after my meal and it tasted great, so I'd say its worth the money."}
{"text":"I happened to pass by here when I went to Cha Me Cha, and it happened Cha Me Cha wouldn't open until 3.  It happened that it's its grand opening, and my stomach happened to start rumbling.  We went in and were greeted right away. The spring roll came pretty fast, and the four pieces were presented well on the dish.  But they didn't have that crispiness.  Next came the green curry beef brisket with rice. The curry wasn't spicy, the beef wasn't tender, but the curry was delicious. Last came the House Special Beef noodle.  The soup wasn't hot and it was kind of tasteless. Meat was overcooked.  Excellent service tho! *10% discount*"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Friday.  The vermicelli were just meh.  The egg roll was dry.  The pork was not tender.  The whole vermicelli looked sad.  The soup noodle didn't flair much better.  Everything was in a broth, so, of course, the meat was not dry.  The broth was supposed to be spicy, but it was way toned down.  I can't eat too spicy in general.  I still found the broth tasted with just a hint of spiciness.    Both the vermicelli and the soup noodle had sufficient portion of noodle, so you would be full."}
{"text":"I was putting this place off due to all the poor reviews but because of Amy Z's review, it gave me more confidence to come here. I ordered the same dish she had which was the satay beef noodle soup $7.99  Service is super fast as I got my bowl of noodle within 2 minutes of ordering. The soup looked like lava and it did have a little kick to it. The vermicelli noodles were like pho noodles but a bit thicker I think. The satay beef was basically rare beef like you would find in pho. The reason for the 4 star is because there was tons of rare beef. Almost every slurp of noodles came with beef. And every time I dug into the bottom of the bowl I found more beef. Plus the beef was sliced super thin and was super rare and it cooked perfectly in the hot soup. The portion of the noodles is a bit small for me but I enjoyed everything about this dish."}
{"text":"I always ordered their large special Pho, the taste is authentic, and you get a bit of everything.  Ingredients are fresh, love the basil leaves they use and it goes really where with the soup.  The price is also reasonable, I would have given this a 4 stars restaurant but they do lack on staff.  On a weekday, there will only be one waitress, believe she is the owner as well, when the place get busy, wait time might not be suitable for someone that needs to go back to work.  On the weekends, there is another old lady helping out cleaning and setting up the tables, but even with the extra person, this place service is slow.  I really like their food, and I hope the owner understand with extra server, each table can do quicker turnaround, and generate even higher revenue.  I have no doubt they will be able to achieve that with the quality of food."}
{"text":"$9 for a 3 item medium pho.. $10 tax and tip included..  3.5 stars... probably one of better pho places..  The rare beef was sliced really thin!!!! Which makes it a smaller portion but tastes better.. it's probably the thinnest I have had at a pho place..  The beef tendon was cut nicely and portioned nicely!  Service was quick!  Not 4 stars because it's a bit pricier then market.. but still. Wet affordable."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 88 is at the corner of the Langham Square plaza so I'd highly recommend going early if you don't want to deal with the nightmare of the small parking lot.  The place itself looks fairly clean and is reasonably small.  There wasn't much of a crowd around noon-hour on a weekday.  I ordered the vermicelli with chicken, which was actually pretty flavourful.  I wouldn't mind an option for a bigger portion though.  We also got lamb skewers, but I wasn't the biggest fan of whatever they put on/in the meat.  My girlfriend got rice noodles with beef and beef broth.  It wasn't bad but neither of us viewed it as exceptional.  The service is a little up and down.  The main waitress we had was wonderful while her colleague was a little rude - she pretty much ignored what I said or asked her, instead opting to talk to my Chinese-speaking girlfriend.  I didn't say anything complex so I'm not sure what the issue was.  I'd consider returning.  Though this place didn't wow me, we'll see what another visit feels like."}
{"text":"Service was good, probably because I was the only one there. I ordered a large special Pho, it was pretty big and I couldn't finish it. The quality of the food though wasn't very great, the broth was bland and the noodles were way too soft. It wasn't just texture, it altered the taste of the noodle too. I think they either overcook their noodles or at least cook it to the edge and have broth so hot it cooks it even more. I think there are better places in Markham for Pho."}
{"text":"Had a craving for pho and wanted to give this restaurant a try. For a Saturday during lunch time they were not very busy.   Service was a little slow. We ordered one satay beef noodle soup and one house special beef noodle soup. Both soup bases were not overly salty which was good. The texture of the noodles were ok but I thought they were a little thick.  Price wise, they are about the same as other pho restaurants ranging from $8-12 for a bowl of noodles.   Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon as there are much better pho options in town."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite Vietnamese beef noodle place!  Their beef noodle is consistently whether in taste of the soup, beef, presentation and amount.  I haven't been able to move onto another item on their menu because every time I come here it is for their authentic beef noodle!  I highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located on Highway 7 and Kennedy Rd. at Langham Square in the plaza with T&T Supermarket. Parking spaces outside the front entrance is limited. I suggest parking in the underground lot.   [SERVICE] - 3/5 Service was average. Our food arrived shortly after we placed our order.   [DÉCOR] - 3/5  Simple, clean, and the place was empty when we came here on a Friday night.   [QUALITY] - 2.5/5 Quality of meat was average, but noodles were a little overcooked and started to stick to one another.   [ORDER] - 2.5/5 - Grilled Chicken with Spring Roll Vermicelli: grilled chicken was average, but not that juicy or tender. In terms of the vermicelli, I didn't like how the noodle strands began to stick to one another. On the bright side, the spring rolls were flavourful, and vegetables were pretty fresh.  - Satay Beef Noodle Soup: nothing too memorable, the satay broth wasn't that spicy, noodles were a little soggy, but raw beef was quite tender   [OVERALL] - 2.5/5 Overall, I would not recommend Pho Mi 88 because there was nothing special about the food, and I would prefer to go to other restaurants in Markham for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Simple little pho restaurant with good portion sizes.  Soup is a little bland but overall, not bad. The beef they give you here is the hot pot beef (frozen and very thinly sliced) so it was nice and tender. The waitress serving us was fantastic! Very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"This is our go-to-spot for pho since we moved up here! We became regulars here and the owner remembers how we like our pho cooked.  She is nice and works efficiently. Overall, this place looks clean and sanitary.  I cringe when I visit other pho restaurants because they are very dirty. We rarely go anywhere else because nothing beats this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pho Mi 88 is another newly open Vietnamese Noodle restaurant in the area.   The interior is nice and clean and staff is welcoming.   The usual menu just like other Vietnamese restaurants so I ended up order a Small House Special Pho Noodle ($7.99) just like what I usually order when I want to try out other Vietnamese restaurants.  I can see how my Yelp friend would be rolling his eyes.. $8 for a Small!!!I guess this is kind of like the price point for most of the places in this area. Sadly, though the broth was served hot it was so bland tasting. Maybe one can argue that it has no MSG but tasteless watery broth was just off.  I might give them another try since it is unfair to base my experience just on one dish. But for now, Pho Mi 88 was just meh for me."}
{"text":"Clean & new place. Mid priced. The lady that served us was courteous. Pho was ok, the grilled chicken was spectacular. Will come back because it is close to me"}
{"text":"Good pho! Nice place, love the plaza here. The service lady is very nice and their menu is easy to read. The pho portion size is huge!"}
