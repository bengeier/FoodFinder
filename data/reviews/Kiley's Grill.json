{"text":"We went there not knowing what the place was about. Our first impression walking in was they did a good job on the decor and the table spacing. We were greeted and seated right away.   The menu had a little bit everything. 101 martinis' is an interesting gimmick. Not my thing however. They had a few steak, chicken, seafood, and pasta options. Plus a pizza and burger section.   The wife had the parmesan crusted chicken with fries and broccoli. I had the fish and chips. Both dishes came with a salad; however the waitress must have forgotten this. She had to come back to our table and ask what dressing we would like on our salad and that was the first time we knew about the salads. The salad came quickly and was a standard dinner salad. Although we both liked the croutons. Unfortunately the main dishes came out before we finished our salads. Better timing is needed there.   Our main dishes were good. Not memorable, but good. The portions were big for the price. The fish and chips were $9.99 and came with three good sized cod pieces and fries. Two lemon slices and two lime slices. With the salad this ended up being a very good value in my opinion. It also tasted good.  The parmesan crusted chicken again was good sized with one big chicken breast. At $10.99 this came with steamed broccoli which was the vegetable of the day (the waitress did not know this and had to get confirmation from the chef) and the wife substituted garlic mash with fries. The meal came with white gravy; however in our humble opinion a marinara sauce would have been a better option. The dish also came with two slices of garlic bread. The wife felt the garlic bread was very good.   We were satisfied with our meals and feel we will go back again. One thing that was very weird though happened at the end. Our waitress came by and noticed we were done and said that somebody will be by soon and then she will have our check for us. 20 minutes later the waitress came by two more times saying she thinks the person was in a meeting. She finally cleared our table and gave our check.   Overall good time just a very weird ending."}
{"text":"I just ate here today, for the first time.  The service is excellent, even the owner took time to come talk to me and was wonderful.  The avacado turkey sandwich was really good.  The fries and onion rings kindof tasted like they had been fried in the same oil as shrimp but other than that all was good.  Very friendly, fairly priced (except for their sodas 2.50).  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Very quality establishment, and friendly place. I went for a major UFC event and it was free to get in the door, which is unprecedented, especially with all the flat screens. Wide open bar, if you live in the area it's worth the trip. I had a few appetizers which weren't anything to scream about, but edible. The tap had about a dozen beers some were local and beyond the standard choices. I will be going back for a UFC event for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for the NFL Sunday Ticket.  Bottom line, Service and Staff was excellent.  From Bartenders to Wait staff, very personable and quick.  Well staffed!  Also, the place is clean and modern... really like the bar!   Why 3 stars?  Well, the bar is only equipped to have one game over the sound system... so you get the main game...not the game you came to see!!  If your main purpose is to see a Football game... this may be a problem for you!"}
{"text":"We found Kiley's on accident.  We were on our way to Von Hanson's Meats and I noticed my car was running hot.  (This was last Saturday - when it was 119 out)  Pulled into the Von Hanson's parking lot, and we decided to get a cold drink and give the engine some time to cool a bit.  Kiley's was in the same parking lot - so it seemed the best (only) choice for a drink.  After hearing the specials (crap beer and house margs), I lamented it wasn't Tuesday or Sunday - when they have $2.50 pints of Guinness.  The bartender offered to honor it!  Woohoo!  We had just been in Total Wine doing a stock up run, and the roommate was interested in the coconut flavored Ciroc vodka - but was hesitant to buy it not having ever tasted it before.  Kiley's had it!  So - coconut soda with lime - WOW for new favorite summer drink!  It was perfect and we're definitely getting a bottle for the house!  We were a bit peckish, so the roommate got and order of wings and I opted for the wing, chicken tender and fry combo plate.  The food was fresh and A-OK.  Nothing amazing - about what you'd expect for typical bar fare.  Some of the menu items were more creative and well thought out - had we been hungrier, we may have gone that way.  All in all, the bartender was friendly and efficient.  The drinks were just as they should be, and it's a perfectly good neighborhood joint.  I don't think I'd make a special trip to Chandler just to go here, though.  Oh - and I was carded!  YAY for me getting carded!  That always makes my day."}
{"text":"well judging from the past reviews on here i had to check this place out and see what it was all about. i will make this quick.  1. the service was great...we were greeted right away and our server was very nice.  2. i ordered some honey habanero wings. they were good but there was no \"heat\" in them at all. we still ate them. like i said they were good....i just wish they were spicy.  3. my son orderd the kids pizza. the pizza was great. of course i always steal bites from his food! did i mention kids eat free there monday thru thurs???? awesome!  4. i ordered a burger. this burger was great! exactly like i ordered it which seems to be a rare thing here in AZ. people are always cooking burgers to the wrong specs..but this place...well...this place did it right! thank you!  5. my lady ordered the philly steak sandwich. she seemed to enjoy it. i took a bite as well. it was ok i guess. could use a little more flavor but besides that...it wasn't that bad.  6. my coors light was cold! gotta love that!  *ok....so i will definitely go back to this place. it had great atmosphere..the food was good...and the service was great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a date night, and were way over-dressed. It seemed a tad run-down to have a 101-martini menu, but the food and service were great. They weren't at all crowded at around 6:30 on a Saturday night.  Of course we had to try the martinis: a Georgia Peach (basically vodka and Dekuyper's peach schnapps) and a Banana Split. It seemed that a large majority of their martini menu relied on the Dekuyper's line of schnapps. I didn't like that they didn't list the drink prices on the menu, but they weren't that expensive I suppose - $6.25 each.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala and he ordered the Chicken Parmesan (the chicken patty was huge - about 6\" round, and fried). On both entrees, the chicken was served beside the pasta, each drenched in sauce separately.   We came with a $25 Restaurant.com coupon and had trouble meeting the minimum $35 food purchase since their food was so reasonably priced. We had to order desert - darn! I ordered the cheesecake with raspberry sauce, and he ordered the carrot cake. Neither were anything special or freshly made - just your standard refrigerated grocery store cakes perhaps.  The food was good and reasonably priced, and it seemed like it might be a fun place to go to watch a sports game.   They have a free shuttle service, which I might try to use on their Wednesday karaoke night sometime"}
{"text":"They have a nice area for live music and they are getting some decent bands to play there -- especially Thursday nights. There is a stage and the sound system is far better than average -- they even have somebody running the sound board and lights.   The dance floor could be bigger but it's better than most places. On Thursday people are dancing until 1 am.  Drinks are reasonably prices. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star is that the selection of draft beers is too limited and doesn't have craft beers."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here twice- both times we never ate there.   The first time we did a delievery order and we were worried that we wouldn't get our food being as it was a resturant that delieveries. We got our food and he had a mushroom/swiss burger and I had the blackeneded salmon and we got the mac and cheese for the little one. We were all impressed by the food.  The second time we went there we did a pick up order and since there was a boxing match on PPV that day and on the tv's they were a little backed up and a little unorgized. They said about 20 minutes for our food but it ended up being more like 30. Overall though the food was great and even our friend who tried out the place has been raving about the burger he had that night. Also, I liked the atmosphere that their patio had..Overall, the food is great and if you get there on a busy night the food is well worth the wait.  They do deliever BUT not all the time..They have a waitress drive the food over to you so it's best if you order for delievery only on the weekdays when they aren't as packed."}
{"text":"I have been to Kiley's with my family since it opened...we honestly really love it! The times that I have been the service has been amazing! As for food, I highly recommend the spegetti! It is amazing and if I correctly recall it's all you can eat! I also try to go with my friend to Kileys on Wednsday's for trivia and Karoke...we always have an amazing time! The drinks are great, the musics great and what we really love is that they play the music videos on the TV's around the bar! My only little complaint is last time we went for Comedy night (Sunday mothers day) the waitress took the sugar off our table then asked if I wanted another iced tea. I said yes but I just ended up not drinking the tea.  I really recommend that every one try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"Went to KIley's on a Wednesday night with my daughter.  We shared some Bacon Burger Sliders, and an order of onion rings.  Sliders were pretty solid. rings were below average.    Hostess was average on personality, but smokin hot in appearance. She had a little bit of that \"I know I'm hot\" attitude, which of course makes her much less hot, in my book.  Place seemed about as clean as a bar, but not as clean as a restaurant should be.  Staff was friendly enough, including our waiter, he just sorta seemed like waiting was not his primary job and he was just helping out.  Did not sample the Martini menu.  ElCorbo"}
