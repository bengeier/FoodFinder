{"text":"Our last stop on the Arizona Brewpub trail.  FATE did not disappoint.  It had the most interesting and varied Beers by far.

Strawberry Rhubarb Berliner Weisse!  A beer that smells like cheese - which I wouldn't think would be a good thing - but what do you know..  So Good.  Try a Chocolate Chili Milk Stout for dessert. Waiter told us that they keep the beer selection pretty fresh - coming up with new ideas all the time.

20 minute wait on Thursday night was OK.  Staff was friendly.  Pizza, Burgers and Salads held the standards well above average bar fare.  Kind of \"out of the way\" in a little strip mall, it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"Nice little spot with friendly staff, good music and great pizza. Had the Rustica and the pepperoni pizza. Both were really friggin good! 
Also had tiramisu for dessert that was absolutely decadent. Food here is fantastic, hands down."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, friendly service! The guys that work there are super friendly, but not annoying. It's a small place so it can get crowded pretty fast.

I really like the goat cheese cranberry salad. The sausage fennel pizza is also very delish.
The toasted mozz is by far my favorite appetizer. I sometimes put my salad in between the toasted mozz. Soo good.

That's pretty much my order every time. I always have a great time when I come here."}
{"text":"McFates had an enjoyable, low key atmosphere, excellent thin crust pizza and pretty darn good beer. Their session IPA clocked in at only 3%, but did not taste thin. If your looking for something you can drink several of and still keep it together, this fits the bill. Their stout and regular IPA were also quite good. However, the Berliner-Weiss was under-carbonated - almost flat. The bartender was very pleasant and recommended a terrific pizza. I will certainly be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Our second visit and everything was wonderful - great beer, food and friendly, attentive service.   Plan on many more visits and will highly recommend this establishment to our friends."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. My second visit re-affirmed my original impressions.  Relatively disappointing as far as breweries go.  As others have noted, a long list of beers but only a few on tap (although they do have guest beers).  I think their beer tastes average at best (but I will admit that this is my personal opinion, everyone likes different things). The menu is limited to wood fired pizza and salads.  I've tried a couple different pizzas and neither was very memorable.  The service is good though and everyone is friendly, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Beers were delicious, a little pricey, but delicious nonetheless. Didn't try the food but it seemed like everyone else was enjoying their pizza."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the beer. Really liked the choc chili stout, but ended up with the hefe as the stout is a bit spicy. The pizza was incredible! We got the rustica which was really good! Excellent service. Omg, the tiramisu was one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"No cider? Really?

Their wine selection is pretty good and the staff was very friendly. Also the place is nicely designed. It gets busy pretty quickly. Can't comment on the food as I didn't have any."}
{"text":"Drove 20 minutes last weekend to get my Fate growlette filled with their new Honey Double IPA.  The bartender said they only had one keg left and weren't filling any to-go orders.  In fact, they only had four Fate beers available and they were only filling jugs with the Sour IPA (which is nasty).  What's the difference if I sat at the bar and had two glasses of Honey Double IPA or filled my growlette with the same amount?  I wasted 40 minutes of driving.  There's a new brewery opening up the street soon.  I doubt I'll be going back to Fate anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times over the last 6 months. Every trip has been a good experience. Pizza is wood fired and tasty. Menu is small but come on, ur here for the beer!. Beer options are always solid. Always something new. Location is tight so seating can be limited. Staff has been knowledgeable and speedy. Solid Option"}
{"text":"First visit review.  Love the atmosphere, decent beer and the best warm pretzel I have either had.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Awsome as always, the pizza is fantastic, service is great.  We prefer the atmosphere of this location over the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and watch the game. Their beer will only get better. Their food menu needs a little work, but the pizzas are solid enough."}
{"text":"Small place but like the people who run it.  Beer selection is ok.  We have tried place a couple of times and each time like it a little better.. we haven't tried the food but it looks really good"}
{"text":"We showed up pretty late on Valentine's night and we were blown away at the tap selection, menu and service. I had two of the IPAs and walked away with a growler to take home. We had a couple of half salads and a plate to share and everything was amazing and a great compliment to the beer. Beyond the amazing beer and food - our server was top notch. She was really super well versed on the entire menu, made great recommendations and really took the time to make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"We went to Fate for the first time tonight and we will definitely be back......soon!!! I went with my husband and young son and we all had different pizzas and they were all great....sausage, margarita and the kids cheese. The beers were also way above par- I had the irish red and it was great! My husband tried several and found them all to be very yummy. Can't wait to go back and try the others. Our server, Alisha was awesome! She was very friendly, attentive and very sweet to my son. Great job and if you haven't tried Fate- you should!!!"}
{"text":"Intéressante microbrasserie!
Les bières sont brassées sur place, variées et excellentes.
Le quartier laisse un peu à désirer c'est plutôt \"style centre d'achat\" comme endroit mais bon... c'est Phoenix. Faut pas trop en demander à cet égard.
Les prix sont très raisonnable et bonne musique!
Je recommande. (4.5/5)"}
{"text":"Best pizza-brewery in town. Customer service is always great. Excellent atmosphere and reasonably priced. Take the time to check out this wonderful brewery."}
{"text":"This local brewery is a must visit!

The Food is incredible. The Breads n' Spreads are simply outstanding and the Chicken Ceasar is one of the best I've had around. The best of the best though is the Popper Pizza - it's lights out!

The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don't have a solid light beer. The cream ale (lightest) takes more like a pale ale with how hoppy it is. Either way I can usually find a good beer from another company on tap, but it would be perfect if they had their own solid light beer."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great food, great beer. DEFINITELY suggest trying it out. we're from out of town, drove by and decided to spend Friday night here. Highly Recommend locals to stop by."}
{"text":"We started out really excited to go to this place, but left feeling sort of deflated about the customer service. 

The decor looked great, background music was a nice indie blend and the place was clean.

When I asked our waitress about the beer selection and that I primarily prefer belgian and wheat ales, she said she couldn't really help me because she only liked hoppy beers since she started working there. She didn't tell me about any of the guest ales on tap (there was an Orange Blossom) or to even help to explain about any of the house beers that would have a low IBU (International Bitterness Units). So I ordered the house root beer. Not bad.

We ordered a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good, but then we waited and waited for the waitress to come around and ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), but she brought us the check (on a slow night with about 12 people in the restaurant) and left before we could even ask her about the desserts. My husband had to go over to the dessert case to get the owner to order our dessert for us. And the tiramisu was really lacking.

Bottom line: For a brewery/restaurant that has been open for more than a few months, I expect better service and consistency than this. Get it together.

Parent Perspective: Two high chairs available (that I saw), two items for the kids' menu and no changing table in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: didn't eat here, just stopped for drinks. Atmosphere was great. Service very friendly and pleasant. Beers were well done. Saw a lot of food going around and I have to say it looked fantastic. Great little place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place ever since the sign first went up, as you can never have too many local breweries.  After eating there, though, I'm a little torn on the rating.  On the one hand, the service was quite good and the place had a nice vibe to it, almost a buzz.  The restaurant is fairly open air and even though we were sat inside, we were close enough to the patio to enjoy this aspect.  In addition, I thought that the food was top notch for a small brewery.  They only have salads and pizza, but both the house salad and the Sunny Side pizza we tried were both interesting and flavorful.  The salad had a great mix of textures and was topped with just the right amount of dressing.  

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the beers and feel that most of the other breweries in town and down the way in Tucson are better.  Their selection was small but not miniscule, as they had five of their own brews on tap and another handful of guest brews.  Neither my wife or I like hoppy, bitter beers-which I find that many smaller breweries tend to focus on-so this immediately cut out selection down to about half.  We sampled their hefeweizen, which we both agreed was underwhelming, as well as one of the light rotator beers that turned out to be nearly flavorless.  Feeling that the American brown would be a fairly safe choice at 36BTUs, I went for a pint of this.  Unfortunately I didn't care for this either, as it was far more bitter than expected and frankly just not that good in my opinion.  

Overall I'd still recommend trying this place, given the quality of the food.  I was mainly disappointed in that it seems to appeal to a narrower group of beer drinkers, but at the same time, I can't dock it too much for this as I'm sure many will find their beers to be appealing.  If anyone has been to Borderlands Brewing in Tucson, I think this would be an apt comparison; personally I can't stand any of their beers but I know a lot of people who love it there."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been here a handful of times and the beer selection is always fantastic. Cool, relaxed local atmosphere. Wood fired pizzas are always an awesome accompaniment to the beer."}
{"text":"I spent the week of Thanksgiving in Phoenix visiting family, so naturally I wanted to try some of the new craft beers being produced in Phoenix.  I moved away from Arizona in 2005 and at that time the craft beer scene was as dry as [insert name of any wash/creek/stream in the Phoenix area here].  I currently live in one of the better known small town craft beer havens, and I routinely visit one of the others up north, so I've become a little bit spoiled when it comes to good beer.

I will not name the other local brewers that I tried prior to visiting Fate, but I won't hesitate to say that I was becoming very disappointed in what Phoenix had to offer in the way of craft beer.  Unoriginal, uninspired, overly hopped IPAs; unoriginal, uninspired, flat pale ales; and drab, flavorless Hefes everywhere.  I had one of the worst Ambers I've ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.  I tried quite a few on draft, some from bottles, and some from cans...all less than impressive.  I had read good things about Fate and as fate would have it (see what I did there?), the last night of my trip allowed me, my sexy beer nerd fiancee, and my sister to make a trip to the brewery.

Fate completely crushed every other brewer I tried while in town.  I started with a flight (Irish Red, Oatmeal Pale, Oatmeal Double IPA, Candy Bar Milk Stout, and a barrel aged double stout), all of them were flavorful, well-crafted, and easy to drink.  I went with a full pour of the Oatmeal Pale, it was that good.  I drank it while eating my delicious wood-fired pizza, it complimented perfectly.  For dessert, I went with a full pour of the barrel aged double stout.  It was definitely the winner of the night for me; aromatic, full-bodied, perfect balance of roast and sweet with just enough of a whiskey kick at the end to prove it was barrel aged.  It was surprisingly smooth for the high ABV.  

Bottom line, if you truly love beer that is well made, tastes like it should, and won't leave you wishing you had just ordered a water and saved the $5-6, you must go to Fate.  They clearly know what they are doing and are producing the best beer I had while visiting the Valley."}
{"text":"Five stars. Beer...great. food....pizza & salad, great. Staff, great. Owner Steve,  great. This is a nice, inviting place w great everything.   Micro brew in house beer. Guest beer (from other micro breweries) wine, wood fire pizza & salad. Happy  hour  4-6 Come see for yourself."}
{"text":"A young brewery that is doing good things. 

The space is decent sized, but I could see it getting pretty packed on the busier days. 

We got a sampler and everything we tasted was good. Nothing really jumped out at me, but nothing made me make a gross face either.

I do agree that they could dive into the realm of lighter beers, but with their size and brewing capacity, they seem like they're just sticking to the sure things as they get off the ground.

Definitely should be a stop if you're in the area brewery hopping."}
{"text":"We decided to sit on the patio by the heater and enjoy our beautiful Arizona weather.  I am not a beer drinker but, after all the reviews I figured I should give a beer a try.  I told the waiter what I was after (not yeasty or bitter, not too strong and a little sweet) He was so patient and brought out a couple of samples.  I loved the hefeweizen and ordered a pint of that.  My boyfriend got their home made root beer which was AMAZING (brought back memories of childhood).  

The waiter was knowledgeable and answered all our questions about the menu.  We decided on pizza and a salad.  The house salad was phenomenal.  Such fresh ingredients with a light dressing and the most wonderful mixture of crunchy and slightly spicy nuts.  I could make a meal out of it and, next time I might!  For our pizza, we got half pepperoni and half fennel sausage.  Both were excellent.  We each liked our own half a bit better so it worked out great.  You HAVE to save room for these little \"cake pops.  They are lollipops that are like a cake/cookie batter with a hard coating on the outside.  They come in many flavors - snickerdoodle, mocha, peppermint red velvet, gingerbread, chocolate coconut.  We got snickerdoodle and mocha and they were both excellent.  The perfect amount for dessert when you are full but still want something sweet.  

They have only been open a week and are still working out a few bumps (the server disappeared a couple of times when we were looking for him) but overall, this was a fabulous experience.  How wonderful to have an independently owned little place like this right in our back yard.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a couple beers and dinner here on a Friday night, and can't give this more than three stars. House beer list seems long but on closer examination doesn't have much variety; out of about ten there are two stouts, two reds, and lots of IPAs. Sorry, but IPAs are a dime a dozen these days, the fallback when a brewer can't think of something more imaginative. The only thing that stood out was an apricot beer that was okay, but too hoppy. The session beer was not good, poor balance - way too hoppy and no malt character at all.

The menu is trendy, full of olives and feta and all things hip and now. We had the potato nachos, which were very light on cheese, meat or anything but potatoes. I had a pizza, not impressed at all but I felt very healthy and cool eating arugula and mushrooms on a dry, cardboard crust. My companion had a salad which was average.

Service was slow and mechanical, the bartenders had friends at the bar who required the vast majority of their attention."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Be prepared prices are high for the food quality. I would compare the food to moderate dining. This place doesn't get to busy, kind of awkward. The beer is always good and drinks are prices fairly well. I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Fate is by far our favorite brewery in AZ. Their beer is among tops in the state. Hubby and I have very differing tastes. He likes super hoppy, I prefer lighter or sour. His favorite is the double Oatmeal IPA. I love the Hatch Chili Cream ale and the Gose they made last year was superb. I hope it comes back this year!  And the Candybar Milk Stout is worth the visit. Can't beat their beer prices either if you ask me.  And we enjoy the creativity with which they approach beer making. Even when their own beer is in short supply, the guest list is more than sufficient. And limited Fate supply should soon be a thing of the past with the new location open. 

I've seen several complaints about the menu. We've always loved the food and tried just about everything on the menu. Of course there will always be items that aren't your favorite so I'm not really sure why people give poor reviews just because they don't like the Irish Nachos? 

As far as service, Fate is our favorite place for service. We are at this point regulars. We know almost everyone by name and they treat us with the same kind of genuine respect and kindness we give to them. The feel is very laid back. So if you're expecting to feel catered to just because it's Scottsdale you will be disappointed. But trust me, if you are a good patron you will be well taken care of. 

Our almost weekly visits will continue!"}
{"text":"Good Stuff.  Excellent food quality and great service.  Bit of a strange vibe."}
{"text":"Small and inviting, this is a great place to grab a beer and a bite to eat.  Their beer is great and the staff is very helpful if you do not know what you want.  The food was unique and quite good.  If you are in the area and need a craft beer fix, this is not a bad place to get that fix."}
{"text":"Overall a very good place!  Nice ambience, good food quality, friendly service.  The owners/managers I believed trained under Tom Hennessy of the Il Vicino and Colorado Boy brewery fame and the quality shows!  Their Pale is very, very tasty but don't construe this as that their other beers aren't also very good because they are.  We had pizzas and were impressed with interesting recipes and proper portioning of ingredients.  Our three kids aged 6-10 were along and made to feel welcome.  This is the neighborhood friendly place you are looking for when you've had enough of the overly plastic feel of Scottsdale!  Bravo and Cheers!"}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews, but was so happy with the beer, pizza and atmosphere, I felt I had to take the time to say, don't miss out on this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Brandon is the best!!!! Try the Zach Attack pizza it is amazing! This place makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"Awesome microbrewery. Great pizza. Great service. Great ambiance! Their beer list and specialty pizzas change and are always incredible! They also have \"guest beers\" which are equally satisfying. Also, try the breads and spreads for an appetizer before you start on the pizza! So many different, yummy flavors!"}
{"text":"I'm a total beer snob from Seattle, and I think Fate is one of the best craft brewers in AZ. Steve and his team make unique beers in small batches, so the list is constantly changing. It has been \"discovered\" so expect a crowd at peak hours, but also expect quality beer. Make a special trip if they have their Imperial IPA on tap - it's their specialty."}
{"text":"What a bad day to try Fate. I've been wanting to check it out for a long time. I was excited to have my cheat meal and try their beers. We show up and a notice on the door says the kitchen is closed due to their refrigerators being broken. Bummer and unfortunate for them. I had come on an empty stomach, planning to eat and drink. Now I'm in a bit of trouble. Luckily my boyfriend had eaten and could drive home. We asked if we could get se food and bring it in since they couldn't serve and we were drinking after all. The answer was a stern no with a bunch of BS added to it. You would think the liability of serving people without food would override having others food in your establishment. Guess not. 

Then there were three guys at the end of the bar. They were three of five in the place. You would think they were hard of hearing the way they were practically yelling at each other to have a conversation. Annoying. We took out tasting flights and moved to a table. 

Another couple came in and were so annoyed by the loud patrons they asked that the music be turned up to drown them out. 

Overalls not a welcoming experience. Trying to take into account what is their fault and what isn't but the customer service was no bueno and that goes a long way. 

Maybe we'll try it again some time...maybe."}
{"text":"The beer at this place is ok. Nothing special to where I told myself, \"Wow this is amazing!\". It was a beer that is beer. The food as well is ok. The pizza is nothing special and isn't as good as you would find at Humble pie for example, which has a cheaper lunch special, you get more for your money, and it doesn't take a 45 minute wait to make a six inch pizza. This place seemed like a great idea but at the end of the day it is just a mediocre place. I don't know how people can rave about it so much? It must be that the people in Scottsdale don't really know what a good craft beer tastes like."}
{"text":"So I've been to this brewery a few times without writing any reviews so needless to say I was slacking, but after my visit last night I've gotta put this on my yelp.

Finally tried their candy bar milk stout and I was not disappointed one bit. Definitely worth going back for, and filling a growler. The taste is pretty spot on with the name, at first my expectations were low because of previous milk stouts that tasted decent, but this one just put all those too shame!!

The munchies came on quickly after that first sip, so had one of their staff pick wood oven baked pizzas. The variety of ingredients on the menu looked a little skeptical at first but just like their beer, after the first bite I was sold! Never had a bad time or experience there and don't see me having one there ever."}
{"text":"Very good beers. They usually have a myriad of their own beers that have great hop- forward flavor. Their food is always delicious. Their food is centered around wood fired pizzas that do not disappoint. And try their homemade chili oil too."}
{"text":"I love that this place is a pinch different from the other local breweries-- brighter decor, a little more open, but still very casual.

The beer selection is great if you're into craft beers. Might not be so much if you're a Bud Light or Coors kind of beer drinker.

If you don't like the beer, you'll still LOVE the thin crust pizza. Must get the Sunny Side-- the capicola ham is delicious and the egg on top is the perfect touch. 

I'd pick this place over Four Peaks any day."}
{"text":"A brand new place we discovered.  The decor seemed industrial chic, yet warm and comfortable.  We ordered a few different pizzas and shared.  I couldn't pick a favorite they were all so good!

But the very best part was the beer.  I tried a few samples before choosing their pale ale with dinner and their brown for desert, some of the best local beer I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Made me want to find a bar called Free Will. Service was, surprisingly, both sluggish and inconsiderate. Beer was just ok."}
{"text":"Visited FATE for the first time last night. To put it simply, this place puts the FATE in fatal. \"Micro\" brewery should be taken very literally. It is a teeny tiny facility with a few tables and only two TVs. I went with the intention of watching a big football game but the bartender absolutely refused to change the station. The typical scottsdale dbag tending bar was extremely aloof and offered zero pleasantries. Upon assessing the first few minutes of my experience there I decided to take my business elsewhere. I look forward to seeing what opens in this location next & I have a feeling it will be very soon."}
{"text":"Fate is an amazing brewery with great food. Try the Twist of fate or one of their phenomenal wood fired pizzas. The beer is out standing and they are constantly rotating in new beers which gives you the opportunity to try new things. The atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. If you are looking for a nice evening or have some free time in the afternoon I HIGHLY suggest stopping in."}
{"text":"In my top five breweries in the Phoenix area. Their IPA are always fantastic and their food is pretty good. Don't know what happened to the hummus at this location though. It seems to have disappeared. 

Recommend this place, less seating than the other location but still a lot of room to have fun. This location is clearly better and the people who work there are nice."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was fantastic. Also lots of beer selections. Service was a bit slow but I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and the drinks are smooth with a great variety to mix and match. This was my first time in and I'll be back to taste other items on the menu.

Server was spot on for service and recommendations.

Highly recommended if you're into the microbrew touring scene."}
{"text":"I came into this brewery yesterday night and sat on the patio. I looked at the menu and saw the \"oh my gatos\" and i loved the name so mich i had to try it. The beer was fantastic. Our server AJ was fun and very knowledgeable. He recommended the jess pizza and it was amazing. This brewing is great our service was stellar. I would definitely recommend this place to all people."}
{"text":"Nice beers, you can tell a flavor profile through the available selections. ZERO complaints on the beer quality and flavor. Fiire oven pizza! You'll pay a little more for it for the size, but hey it's FIRE OVEN.
Limited menu to pizzas n such.
Service was exactly timely.
Happy hour late afternoon has beers for $4.40. DEAL.
I hear happy hour period is a zoo so get there early. I was there late evening.
NORTH Scottsdale vibe.... if that's your sort of thing.
Some people need to be kicked in the balls/cunny to loosen them up.
Maybe I should get famous first I guess, cuz I already have the looks, just no movie credits. .. PUH.
I prefer the approachable friendliness of SOUTH Scottsdale's Papago Brewing and Pig n Pickle. One day I'll come during happy hour party zone, they gotta be better than the sticks in the mud that were there when I was there."}
{"text":"Beer was decent.  Poutine was a disappointment.  Pizza was OK.

All in all, not bad, not great."}
{"text":"Love the patio. Service was excellent. Excellent selection of beers. Nuts and olives were fantastic. Can't wait to return and try out more if the food menu."}
{"text":"$3.75 pints during happy hour, what up?  I thought this place would be bigger, but it's cool just the way it is, strip-mall style.  Feels finished, though it's been open only a year.  They have 6 of their beers, and 6 guest taps, which is plenty for the size of the place.  No bottles.  I really like this place and I see what all the buzz is about in scottsdale now!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, the Jess really good plus a couple Irish Red's!!  Great service from Fez and good music!!!"}
{"text":"Just had a few beers, and that will be the last time I ever go there. The place was very modern and pleasing to the eye, just the way you want your local brewery to be. Bit that's the best it got. The beer was average at best, Nd I drink a lot of craft beers. The prices were a little steep for food and the menu was small. But what made my experience horrible was the guy at the entrance. He was insulting our group as we left and was very unprofessional. So we asked what his name was. He said \"I'm Steve the owner\" if this is true, its the last time I ever visit."}
{"text":"I went from giving 3 and 4 star reviews to just sharing tips, so when I post a review a few things are already evident. First it is a place worth sharing, it's an atmosphere and or menu worth mentioning, and somewhere I want others to enjoy. 
HERE YOU ARE!  Fate brewing North Scottsdale. Please come and find for yourself a little piece of culinary happiness, and a great brew.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Wow! I am a big craft beer guy and Fate brews the best around. Their candy bar milk stout and their double IPA are in my top 5 favorite beers ever. Everything else I have had has been solid as well. Food is very good and service has always been attentive as well. I will be coming back here regularly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. From its relaxing atmosphere to the best food Fate is one of our favorite spots in Scottdale!!"}
{"text":"Good food great IPA the bar tender was friendly. Would definitely go back for another beer and wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Great place.  However, as a Double Oatmeal IPA fan, I really wish this was on tap much more than it is."}
{"text":"What We Ordered:

1 Gingerbread Stout



1 \"The Jess\" pizza (garlic oil, mozzarella, baby spinach, bacon, roasted garlic, ricotta, parmesan)

Atmosphere: A

I love it at McFate's. It just feels so nice and cozy. The bar area is super cool, and we always love sitting at the hightop tables or out on the patio. It definitely has a low-key vibe, and the brick oven always adds a nice warmth and is a visual plus. 

Cleanliness: A

Easy. Not much to complain about here. Nice and clean.

Service: B+

We've been to McFate's Tap & Barrel a few times before, and service has always been awesome. This particular experience didn't match our previous visits unfortunately. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Not memorable at all. Our server was a girl who didn't even bother mentioning her name, and also didn't smile once. I work in the F&B industry as a manager myself - most of my job is literally to smile and ensure people feel welcome and comfortable. Smiling is always something that should happen during a dining/drinking experience. Just didn't happen this time. On another note, she was able to snag us a few leftover gingerbread man cookies from last night's event! That was a nice touch :)

Food: B+

Food is solid. \"The Jess\" is a killer combo of pizza ingredients, and the pizzas are cooked well in their brick oven. In a previous visit, I also tried the Caesar Verde - a caesar salad with some pesto added to it - and it was super tasty. I like how simple they keep their food menu. It's a great way to keep customers happy (and full) while being able to relax and enjoy the true star... the BEER!

Beer: A

My first time going to McFate's I actually wasn't too impressed with the beer. I did a flight of a few random ones, and they were just OK. But then...

Then I stopped by once and got the Candy Bar Milk Stout. 

And it changed everything. 

I'm a huge fan of all things dark beer, and the Candy Bar Milk Stout is absolutely outstanding. Perfectly sweet, with salty, nutty and chocolate notes. It just doesn't get much better. One of my favorite sweet stouts is White Russian Stout by SunUp, and the Candy Bar Milk Stout is right up there with it. Totally killer. 

Sorry - I guess I kind of got off-top for this particular visit. Because the Candy Bar Milk Stout is no longer being brewed right now, I went with the gingerbread stout (one of my servers told me earlier today how fantastic it was, so choosing it was a no-brainer). The gingerbread stout was definitely a good stout, especially for the holidays. In my book it's not quite as tasty as the almighty Candy Bar Milk Stout, but again - still a solid beer for sure. 

Creativity: B+

The only way I give an establishment an \"A\" for creativity is if they do something totally crazy, and that's not McFate's. They are solid all the way around, and while their seasonal beers are definitely unique and delicious - they aren't anything completely nuts. Which honestly, can sometimes be a good thing. McFate's is consistent and dependable."}
{"text":"Visited Fate Brewery on Tuesday for
Happy hour.. Kitchen was out of service, unfortunately,however working in the F&B industry, things break and I can understand that is not always the establishments fault. That being said, everything else was great!! The beers are all very unique and delicious.. The Hatch Cream Ale was unlike anything I have ever tasted before! Service was very friendly and attentive from the bar staff. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their brewery and it shows!. Definitely will be back to try food sometime!"}
{"text":"Really poor service.  Food was ok, but it shouldn't take 60min to get a salad.  The waitress kept forgetting us, and it wasn't even that crowded.  This is really just a bar, so stay away if you are hungry, and especially if you are on your way to a movie or on a schedule"}
{"text":"Fate Brewery was really great experience. We went there for our friend's birthday dinner and they were very accommodating, placing us together and emailing us ahead of time to confirm head counts. When we got there the server was very nice, understanding we wanted different checks and was very fast on getting us our drinks and pizzas. They even set up a different table for all of our pizza selections, since we had so many. 
The wait for the pizzas were very short and all of the pizzas were delicious. I think between our whole group we had each one. My favorite one was the chef's specialL The Honey Bee with arugula. 
Overall the atmosphere was great. Even though it was Fourth of July, they didn't rush us out. Overall it was a great time."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Delicious beer and the food is incredible!
My boyfriend and I decided to try their weekly special a while ago instead of going with the pizza we usually get (the Jess) and are now addicted to the bees knees!!! Bring it back!!! It had arugula, bacon, a specialty cheese, and HONEY! It was incredible! They haven't had it since but went out of their way to make us something similar the last time we were in :D 
If you stop in here you have to get the pretzels they are the best!
Cold beer, hot food, awesome service. 
Very laid back atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Fate Brewing Company is new to the Valley, and I was excited to try their beers. I headed in and ordered a flight. The place is small, but the beer is great! Their smoked porter is one of the best beers I have had in months. Their IPA is pretty great, too. I had the chance to try some of their beers at a beer festival and they were a highlight of our time at said festival. 

They also have wood-fired pizza here. I have had a few different pizzas, and their pizza bread is amazing. Oh, and the dipping sauce. I have no idea what it is, but it is AMAZING! I pretty much want to take a bath in it. So good. 

Fate is in a great location, too. Really excited that a new brewery has opened and they are producing good beer. And how could I forget... CAKE POPS! Yes, they serve cake pops. This place just keeps getting better. If you like good pizza and great beer, check out Fate Brewing Company. You won't be disappointed. When you are there, ask if the owner is there. He's a great guy and likes talking to fellow craft beer enthusiasts. Bottoms up, people!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! The pizzas were very tasty and we are looking froward to try more of them. We got the jalapeño one and the truffle one, so good. 

The beers were tasty, I really enjoyed that they had other local breweries in addition to their own brews. 

The staff were very polite and attentive, we can at the end of happy hour and the place was still packed. The guy running the hostess stand said it would be about twenty, it was more then that and he came to us to apologize and explained that people are done and are just hanging out - almost right after he came we were seated."}
{"text":"Really good food, and great beer with a huge variety on tap.  My only grip is they only had three beers available in cans to go. Wish they had more available."}
{"text":"Fate is one of my favorite Micro Breweries in Phoenix. They have great pizza for a quick bite at lunch. The Mediterranean is excellent with just the right amount of kalamata olives.  The salad I had was great with blue cheese and candied pecans with sunflower seeds.  The real stand out for me is their unique beers they make and tap.  The Candy Bar Stout is just as awesome as it sounds brewed with peanuts, vanilla, and coco nibs. If you drop in to get a growler they have it on tap with nitrous and it's amazing.  The bartenders are always very friendly and willing to answer questions and fill up a growler to go. If you a re in the mood for a more standard beer check out the belgian Dubbel it's very good with everything."}
{"text":"Our favorite local brewery! Very unique beers and it is always exciting to try something new. I love the hatch chili cream ale and the candy milk stout is real good. Pizza is also very good and atmosphere is modern and sleek.  Service always very good too"}
{"text":"Off to a good start...hoping they stay open since others in the area keep shutting down (adios Nimbus).  Beer selection was good - especially enjoyed the Irish Red - and the ambiance was appealing.  Pizza was fair, as my search for acceptable pizza in the valley continues.  Wish there were other options besides pizza.  Overall a good experience - rooting for this place."}
{"text":"The Audi Club of Arizona organized a little meet / greet happy hour at Fate Brewing recently. One of our members had heard about the place and the weather+patio+good brews and chews was the ideal mix. I contacted the manager to see about setting up a place for a group of about 10 people (we ended up with 15). Steve was welcoming and quick to respond. The day of I arrived early and Travis (I believe) guided me to the table, the wait staff was great and gave great recommendations. Individual checks were done without a blink and we all know that can be difficult when a group arrives at different times etc. All in all, excellent experience. The food, the brews, the homemade root beer, and the staff were great. The location just off of Scottsdale road and Shea was easy to navigate and with a back entrance by the additional parking made it even easier. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been working some straight to the point reviews lately so I'm going to keep up with my current trend. Heres the 1,2,3.

The beer is on point! The Imperial IPA was the super star tonight. Just an amazing beer. All of the beer offerings were well made. Good stuff all the way around.

The pizza is MONEY!!! Wood fired, thin crust, fresh ingredients. This is what all other pizza wants to grow up to be! Possibly....the best pizza in Phoenix.Yeah, I effin said it! Loved it. We had a salad too. Great but completely overshadowed by the pizza.

Nice build out, comfortable atmosphere and friendly service. This is a great place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"If your a wife or girlfriend trying to Appease the beer enthusiast that is your counter part I highly recommend Fate! My husband loves the beers and always tries to grab a growler to go :) i, on the other hand, love the pizza. It's the only place in town we've found that pizza is done right! When my mother in law came in from Chicago we took her here and she said the pizza is better than a lot of places back home which is a huge compliment! I'm always the DD when we come to Fate but I don't mind bc the food and atmosphere are that great :)"}
{"text":"Love the beer (Cream Ale is my favorite) and love that they have something new every time we go.  The food is also very good and they welcome special orders which is a nice touch for picky eaters like myself.  The food menu is somewhat limited, but that does not bring my rating from 5 stars to 4 at all."}
{"text":"Great vibe, fun, open, nice bar, friendly staff.  Kind of like a cool, easy going neighborhood hangout.  Beer was fantastic, had the stout and irish red.  Didn't try the pizza, but will be back very soon to give that a try.  We need more of these locally owned (non corporate nationals) in the area.

Went back this weekend and had the pizza.  Two problems, 1-this place could seriously impact my waistline, as the pizza was great!!! 2- this place is becoming too popular, my favorite beer (Irish Red) was out, and wouldn't be back in the taps for another 10 days.  I think they are going to need bigger tanks, for more beer!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible and slow service.

Just a lot of attitude from the waiter, and the beer there is really hit or miss.  Mostly miss.

The pizza is decent, but overall I just found myself really annoyed with the whole experience.  Also a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a neighborhood beer and pizza and/or salad.  We sat at the bar and the service was extremely attentive.  Pizza was hot and fresh and we liked the thin crust.  Also have a nice selection of wine if you are not a beer drinker.  This place definitely has a nice \"neighborhood\" feel and staff works hard to make you feel at home and enjoy your dining experience."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for happy hour on a Monday, and I came and left and very happy man. Typically Monday-Friday 3-6, it was a dollar off tap beers and appetizers, which is pretty much everything I would get here regardless. The menu includes pizzas for dinner options.

Monday at 5:30 was surprisingly empty - yet when we left around 6:30 place was almost packed. Maybe people don't get beers and just get pizza?

For apps my friend shared the Irish Nachos. Basically the happy marriage between loaded potato skins and nachos, this dish I think is the standout on the menu for the reason and the one we'd get every time.

Apparently the menu rotates very fast according to some Yelpers, and true enough I can't find some of the drinks I really enjoyed. I really liked the Export Stout - good hints of a coffee like flavor without too much going on. I had a Hefeweizen I really liked too but it's off the menu and I can't find the name. 

I think this is a really nice place for the area, not as overwhelmed as other places like fourth peaks with decent bites and beers. With Raising Cane's across the street now, Fate North looks like it's headed towards my favorite's in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Clean, comfortable, unpretentious neighborhood brewery. Loved the Bavarian pretzel.  The barrel aged porter is smooth.  Travis is knowledgeable and gregarious. Good place to hang with friends.  Spacious with a good vibe. Love the skateboard truck for a tap!"}
{"text":"Good beer.  I tried the double pale ale which was very good.  Poor, slow service and average food.  Irish nachos are a great idea but like warm and not enough bacon."}
{"text":"So. Damn. Good. Not a single beer we didn't like. Wish it was closer to the west side. Try the Truff Dive pizza."}
{"text":"Every good thing you've heard about this place is true. The staff is excellent and the beer is awesome. Try the Pizza it's the best."}
{"text":"Best craft brewery in the Valley.  And their food is equally good. Love the wood fired pizzas and have tried several of them over the last couple of years.  Don't pass on their house-made chili oil with your pizza - it's very good.  Their house salad is quite tasty and very fresh - I always make sure to get one.

We always sit at the bar and have a great time talking with the bartender, owner and other guests. It's just a friendly neighborhood place.  But we have fun everywhere we go.  It's a matter of attitude isn't it?"}
{"text":"We stopped in this weekend for beer and dinner.  

While the beer had been a solid three stars before it was now a solid five stars (American Pale Ale).  Truly an exemplary example of the IPA style somewhere between the mega hopped American IPAs and English IPAs.  

Liquid Art for your enjoyment on tap.

The food was a solid three stars.  The only downside was the bread was burnt for the bread and spread appetizer."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here because ohso and four peaks were way too crowded. Very limited beer selection but they brew it so that's understandable. They only serve pizza and salads but they were good. Little on the pricey side. I could do 3 1/2 I would."}
{"text":"This is an easy 5 star rating for me. Looking for tremendous beer, awesome pizza and great service? Fate Brewing is the place for you. This has such a great \"neighborhood\" restaurant/brewery feel that invites you in and brings a smile to your face. The employees are all incredibly nice and seem to genuinely be enjoying their job. The brews rotate often, so stop in to see what's on tap or check their Facebook page...they update new happenings quite often. The pizzas are wood fired and have nice a thin crust with very fresh toppings. Nice salads too. Cheers to the whole crew at Fate!"}
{"text":"No complaints regarding the beer itself, but the service could be improved.  Was there on 11/28/2014 with some friends from Fort Collins (O'Dell New Belgium, Equinox, etc.) and had to run down our server more than once to find out what was going on with our order.  I did have their pale oat pale and wanted to get a growler filled, but I did not have a growler with me.  I called today (12/5/2014) to make sure they still had some and was told they did and could fill a growler, but when I got there I was told there was some miscommunication on their part and that they only had one keg left and would NOT fill a growler.  Not sure if it was due to the difference in price if they sold me 4 sinle pints as opposed to a growler, pretty disappointing.  I used to live in Fort Collins and never had this issue with any breweries there.

12/12/2014 - I have to add an update to my original review.  Fate's owner contacted me and has definitely made up for my experience, which I really appreciate his effort to make it right.  Quality Beer, quality food, and quality ownership.

Thanks Steve"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here during my first visit to Fate while getting a salad. But the second time around it was fine.

Food: pizzas are pretty standard, they don't wow me. Salads are good, a tad overpriced but hello, Scottsdale how are you doing?

Service: slow! Every time we came here there were like 2 people serving 10 tables. Everything took forever but I don't blame the servers though, Fate needs to get some more personnel going!

Beer: I am not a beer drinker but my friends do and most of them love it there. So the beers have to be good. Though i tried their house Root beer, pretty fantastic. Loved it."}
{"text":"Beer is good, but the menu is pathetic. I like their Irish red, but they were out of it when I visited last on 7/1/15.

The menu just plain sucks, so don't go there for the food. they need to serve burgers , what beer place doesn't serve burgers? Seriously!!!!!   Need to redo their entire menu and get a new chef or don't serve food at all.  We asked the waitress if the Irish Nachos were good.  Of course her lips said yes,  but her body language said no.   We could so tell she was lying."}
{"text":"Tasty beers and pretzel. Try the Hatch Chili beer. Austin was an awesome server!!  Very friendly environment. Enjoyed the patio with a heater. Wood fired pizzas are delicious. Happy hour doesn't include food :("}
{"text":"Came to Fate Brewing with my Fiancee on July 3rd and Had a bite and a flight. 

Has a bit of a restaurant feeling when you walk in. Regular tables and Bar seats to situate at. 

The brew tanks are sitting behind the glass doors so it still gives you a bit of that brewery feeling when you see them. 

Food: 
Wood fired pizza which was pretty darn good. We had the Rotating special pizza which had Spinach, Bacon, Garlic and Honey. It was surprisingly really good. 

Beers: 
Had a flight of 5 
Oh my Gatos- Golden ale- Very light. Easy to drink, very smooth. Enjoy this outside on a hot day..very refreshing. 

Single Hop Sour(cascade)- Not super sour like sours can be, the cascade hops with the citrusy flavor was a good balance. You do get that hint of  salivating sour feeling while you sip. Really good

Totes McOats- Was hoping for a little bit more IBUs out of this Pale ale. A little bit on the light side but still was enjoying when i was sipping this away. My taste buds enjoyed this one
 
American Pale ale- Really good balance of Hops in this West-Coast Pale ale. at 6.0abv and 66ibus- i was likeing this 

Rye So Serious- Now my favorite out of the 5. the RED IPA, Coming in at 70IBUs, i saved this one for last. If you like IPAs, get a pint of this. doesn't disappoint. Taste it for yourself. 

I enjoyed this brewery and liked the decor/ambiance. If this was in San Diego, i would definitely visit this place frequently. Next time my fiancee and i are in scottsdale, this will be the first stop. Ill be wearing my FATE brewing shirt too!

Keep it up FATE- Hopefully you get your beer distributed to San Diego, i would definately buy."}
{"text":"By far the best beer in the Valley- very personable bartenders.  Tony especially!
Wood fired pizzas are over top delicious!

Go there you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The brewery had a friendly atmosphere, it is a smaller venue and when we went it was absolutely packed on a Wednesday night.  The beer was innovative and I like that they sell growlers of their beers to take home.  The pizza was inspired, especially the item that had habanero honey on it. It was so good I had to get some to dip my pizza in!  The Only reason this place didn't get 5 stars from me is that it was under staffed."}
{"text":"Beer-wise, this is the best brew-pub I've been to in AZ, and I've been to A LOT of them.  The smoked porter was a unique idea, well-executed.  The pale ale had a great aroma and a hoppy character, but not a typical 'me-too' American ale.

Service was very attentive and friendly, though we did get a bit stranded between our salad and pizza course....  The pizza was a very nice thin-crust (not as thin as, say, Lamp's), plenty of toppings, sauce was good.  The aforementioned salad (spinach) was very tasty with a nice dressing and plenty of stuff.  My only quibble would be that a slightly larger menu would be nice -- maybe throw in a couple more topping options and a couple apps.  Focused is good, but just a little more variety would be the spice."}
{"text":"With all the pizza places on this particular corner, I would have expected a new place coming in to be over the top.  The margarita pizza was just sad.  Barely any cheese, made with sauce instead of fresh tomatoes, just an all around bust.  They don't have much on the menu - especially for someone gluten free.  

The wait staff was awesome."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here, but the wood fired pizzas look and smell amazing. I have come for the craft brew, and they do a great job. It is all small batch so your choices change often which is nice. There is a small patio, but the room opens up with garage doors to make the inside feel like the outside."}
{"text":"Was up in the area so stopped to check it out.

Overall good place with craft beers done in small batches. The selection at this time was not my favorite so i am going to have to go back when it aligns more with the kind of beer i like. They had seven diff ones most were too hoppy for me the standouts where the red and sour. They also have beers from other brewers to round out the selection.

Simple and clean decorations and has viewing of the brewing gear, a pretty small place in general.

Menu is basically a pizza place (have wood fired oven) with salads and bar snacks. Not wide offering but good. Pablo honey pizza was a nice change of pace.

So after i go back when they have some more stouts and balanced beers i will review again."}
{"text":"Great experience !  We had a blast, just my husband and I, but the staff quickly became friends!  Wish this location was closer!  Small, but a good vibe!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise while in Scottsdale.  Their brews are extremely well done for such a small joint, and the wood fired pizzas were exceptional.  I highly recommend this micro-brewery and restaurant."}
{"text":"My partner and I stumbled upon Fate yesterday and loved it! We had the Mediterranean pizza, and it is by far the best pizza we have found in the area. The pizzas are 12\" and run around $11 - definitely an affordable lunch! Their hot pepper oil is incredible, too. It's a perfect balance or herbs and spiciness. I had the oatmeal stout and he had the IPA, and we were both pleased. There were quite a few beers on the list that they didn't have on tap, which was disappointing, but it gives us more incentive to go back! The place itself was incredibly clean and sleek, providing a really nice atmosphere that you don't find at most Phoenix area brewpubs. I definitely recommend Fate!"}
{"text":"Cute little local brewery in the always-congested area of Scottsdale & Shea.  Their pretzels are dang tasty and the flights are a great deal.  To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan of their house drafts except for the Strawberry Milkshake."}
{"text":"Great place, well worth your time. Food is good. Price is on par for what you would expect in Scottsdale.

Beer is very solid. The only thing I don't like is that I will often go specifically for their American Pale only to find they don't have it. They have plenty of other quality beers and I have yet to be disappointed but I still want at least 2 or 3 regular standbys for the regulars."}
{"text":"Love this place. Stopped in after an event at the senior dog rescue with another volunteer because Yelp brings them up on the \"Bloody Mary\" list. Our waiter, Fausto, looks as us dismayed because it's Saturday and they are closed Easter. They normally make Bloody Mary's on Sunday and because they will be closed, they did not get any mix. He then goes on a hunt and finds just enough mix to make one drink. 

I happily order a mimosa, my friend orders her one Bloody Mary and we survey they menu while we sit on the patio. The menu looks amazing. Our server is swamped with tables, so by the time he gets back we've decided on a pizza. His suggestions are The Jess or the Con Carne. I don't eat meat so I ask if we can do the Jess without bacon. He suggests half bacon so my friend can have it on hers. Great suggestion so she can still enjoy the full combination. 

We replenish with another round of drinks, mimosas, he keeps the water coming and our pizza arrives. It has baby spinach, ricotta, huge chunks of  sautéed garlic, cheese and bacon on her half. The crust is crispy through and through, no sog anywhere. It was phenomenal. 

After our food, we ask Fausto if they have a dog friendly patio (of course we want to know if we can bring some of the senior dogs over with 'Adopt Me' vests on to relax while we eat and get them out and about). He says absolutely, gives us his name, his managers name, and is absolutely awesome.

Overall we had an amazing meal, a great server, and we will definitely be back and would recommend."}
{"text":"Constantly rotating selection of creative beer and some great pizza combinations from their pizza oven.  Great variety in beer, everything we tried was good."}
{"text":"The beer here is nothing special at all. Most of it is the typical over-hopped, flavorless stuff that a lot of places seem to be serving these days. If it were just a tap room, I'd give it two stars at most. But the pizza is good, the service was friendly and prompt, and it's a nice place. Just don't expect much from the beer and you should be happy."}
{"text":"One of the best beer places around.   The IPAs rock.   I love this place.   Worth the drive.  Friendly staff and awesome beers.  Way to go STEVE!"}
{"text":"Fate Brewery is a great addition to Arizona's local breweries. The combination of yummy fresh food plus beer is awesome, and when you can add cake pops to the mix, well it's hard to put all that happiness in words. The brewery restaurant itself is nice - lots of light, outdoor seating with a garage-type door that opens out onto a patio, view of the brewing cask/tanks, and warm soothing colors. We had:

- Garlic Pizza: Damn good! Flavorful garlic olive oil sauce, lots of cheese, and fresh basic and tomatoes. The crust is really good.
- House Salad: Always impressive when a place that serves beer can also make a good salad. Lots of cheese and other toppings, and everything was fresh.
- The Beer: Pretty good. I was a little disappointed in the Cream Ale because I was expecting a luscious creamy beer, but it wasn't. In fact I thought the Hefe was way more creamy. 

Overall, Fate Brewery is a great place to go with friends or a date or coworkers. The people working there all seemed really nice, and we had a good time there."}
{"text":"I stopped in to see what is new. I was hoping for the milk stout and they have prize winning candy milk stout which I enjoyed. They had an IPA which is supposed to have \"enough\" IBUs. It was OK. I asked about IBU numbers and was told 180 which seems improbable.  It is possible though taste buds can't detect the higher numbers so I shouldn't question it.  This is a good place to stop by when we are in Scottsdale... And we will"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a glass of wine & a pizza. Nice place, staff super friendly, an extremely busy place! But you were well taken care of! Would absolutely go back again & the Pizza was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I have only stopped in here a couple of times and just had a beer both times, but I look forward to trying the food. The beer is great and the Candy Bar Milk Stout is f'n delicious! I'll be heading back this weekend for a growler of that stuff.

Staff is good and attentive. The vibe is very laid back. The kind of place that invites you sit and enjoy your beer.

Next time food, and an updated review."}
{"text":"It doesnt suck, the place and service is average in every way, the food is ok, pizza was decent 7 out of 10!!"}
{"text":"We've probably been here 20+ times on a date by now and I can't say it's ever been anything less than a five star review. 

One of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life. You've got to try their habanero honey oil that they put on pizza. Holy cow. 

This place is one of a kind. Outstanding service. The bar manager is so fantastic...we are always treated very kindly and  entertained. You couldn't ask for a better neighborhood bartender. 

They have wine, root beer, and beer. Fantastic rotating beer menu. My favorite is their American IPA. 

My favorite date night spot. It's my version of serendipity ;)"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for some beers and something to eat and O M G were we blown away. I tried 4 beers and they were all excellent, my favorite though was the Fateful IPA. We also got \"the Jess\" for pizza which was soooooo good! I probably could have ate one by myself it was THAT good. They also have a habanero oil that u can put on your pizza or dip -  make sure you get that shit. This place is awesome and I will totally be coming back with friends soon."}
{"text":"There is definitely something to say about a brewery that is frequented by patrons who work at competing breweries.  Guess they know their business and their beer.  Fate is a friendly place.  A cute bar, tables inside and out.  The staff was AMAZINGLY FRIENDLY and I am so glad we decided to sit up at the bar instead of a table.  Everyone in front and behind the bar helped us in our beer and food selection and they were spot on.  We had Irish Nacho's that are exactly what you would...sliced potatoes with a bunch of yummy stuff on top.  As for the beer selections, there are many, especially if you are a fan of fruity, citrus, chocolatey, sour, or wheat beers (which I am not).  But, it was still fun trying them all.  Check it out...you'll meet all the other breweries employees while you are there."}
{"text":"Slow service. I think they were short handed. The beer and food were very good. Seems like a hip place to be in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been here four times in the past year.  This is a cute little place.  It has a small menu, but it is enough to satisfy your appetite.  This last time we were a group of 13 people and they were quickly and happy to accommodate us.  We sat in the patio area.  Our server was Fausto and he was really great.  This time I had the roasted rosemary potato pizza and a spinach salad.  It was really delicious, but Scott's fennel pizza, smelled like heaven.  I have had that one before, and I know it is amazing.  Several people ordered the potato chips nachos, they looked delicious.  I also had the Irish red beer.  I liked it.  They also offer flights of beer, which some people really liked.  I am just starting to drink beer, so I am not as adventurous with them yet.  I will definitely keep coming back.  It is a very relaxed and casual environment."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing!! I live in Gilbert but I'd drive here any day to come here for dinner!' The Jess pizza and the caprese salad was amazinf"}
{"text":"My husband and I dropped by for happy hour a few weeks ago and this place was pretty good.
Great atmosphere and service. Also, good selection of beer. I was a little sad that they didn't offer a sour beer but I believe I had just missed it by a few days. 
We ordered the pretzel and cheese as an appetizer and a pizza for our main dish. Both were okay but just pretty plain bar food. 
I would definitely go back for the beer and atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"Fate is the best small brewery and restaurant in the Phoenix area!  It is not even close.  Their beers are always flavorful and delicious.  There are usually at least 6 of their own beers and a few \"guest\" selections to choose from.  Always something for everyone.  The food is also excellent.  They could offer sharper knives for cutting the pizza.  That would be my only suggestion.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with a great concrete bar and 2 TV's with the sound off.  A \"garage door\" joins the inside and outside areas together.  My favorite beer selections are the Irish Red and the American Pale Ale.  Both are excellent.  Also anything with Hatch Chili's is pretty good as well.

Fausto is a great server.  If you are lucky enough to get him you will be well taken care of.

I have been to many other craft breweries in Arizona and none are as good as Fate."}
{"text":"The beer is good.  Very good.  At least 4 stars or so as beer goes.  They got the 5th star though for the pizza.  This is quietly one of the best pizza places in the valley (shove your Neapolitan pizza where the sun don't shine)."}
{"text":"We decided to head to Fate for lunch to celebrate my big 3-0 birthday, based on all of the positive Yelp reviews. I'm happy to report that it didn't disappoint. The beer, pizza and cake pops were all on point. Our server was friendly and super attentive, in fact we joked that she may have Psychic powers!! I would highly recommend Fate and will definitely return the next time were in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Fate, the service, food and drinks were all exceptional.  We originally came in just to try the beer but after hanging out for a while and smelling the wood oven we gave in and ordered a pizza.  I am so glad we did, the pizza was one of the best I have had in quite a while.  We had the Con Carne wood fired pizza and the meat was perfect and the fresh herbs tied it all together and rounded out the flavor nicely.  We tried all of the beers that had and all were good.  My favorites were the Single Hop Sour and the Oh My Gatos Golden Ale.  Fun name as well!  If you are looking for a cool little spot with easy parking, friendly employees and great food and beer Fate will hit the spot."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuum. Beer and pizza was awesome! Atmosphere was fun too! The service was ok but everything else made up for it. Our kids asked to go back here twice in once week because the pizza was so good- we obliged!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's at a great location and easy to get to.  From the moment we walk in, we are greeted with a smile and a great attitude.  We've been here twice and each time has been great.  They serve thin crust pizza.  Try the Capicola.  They also brew their own beer plus they offer guest taps, which they change up ever so often.  Everyone is friendly and we love this place."}
{"text":"So after my last review I have been meaning to come check out Fate Brewing again especially their food. So this time around I stopped by and had dinner on a Friday night and as usual this place was packed. I really do enjoy the laid back atmosphere and the chill music. But my taste buds just don't agree with their beer I tried a few new beers and still wasn't satisfied. To me they just don't stick out enough to want to come back not to mention there brick oven pizza is just that and nothing more. Don't get me wrong I am not trying to bash this place and I really want to like Fate but its just not happening."}
{"text":"I may be a tad biased, but in reality the beer is better than most I have tried. The red, cream ale and the specialty brews are the best I have had. The pizza is always on point and you can't beat the staff. You will definitely not want to miss out on this place if you are anywhere close! Here is a quick tip, call, FB, or find out what they have on tap, if they have a fan fav, people tend to drink it up fast!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Fate. Don't always find myself up here, but after recent visits to N. MTN Microbrewery & SunUp I was damn well excited to be walking in. At the bar we tasted a sample of the Single Hop Sour which made my socks roll up and down - twice. Wow. Nice effervescence as well. A sample of the Irish Red - solid.  A sample of the Cream Ale came with an eye roll and recommendation to order the flight. I'm sharing the samples with my wife, mind you. No worries, we are humble people, and he did provide the Cream Ale, which was lovely. But I really really wanted a sample of the Am. Pale Ale. We huddled and hatched a bold plan - go with a 50/50 mixed pint of the Sour with the Am. Pale. We were counting on the Pale to be as awesome as the Sour, and also subdue it some, so my socks only rolled up & down once. Of course the real brilliance was that we didn't need to upset Donny Darko for another sample. Well DD wasn't impressed. He lowered his head as if in pain as he poured. I tried to brighten him up - 'you must get this request often, huh?'
Sloooow painful shake of the head. 'Never'. Well buckle my chin strap if this wasn't a delightfully beautiful collision of deliciousness (and, truth be told, DD made it a 70/30 mix - no worries incentive to come back and experiment). I may never be forgiven by the Beer Gods of Etiquette (or the bartender) for my reckless behavior, but my taste buds keep asking me to go back. Hats off the the brewmaster. Fine selection indeed."}
{"text":"Pizzas were fantastic. We ordered the Con Carne and The Jess. These were brick oven pizzas that really lived up to the expectation. The beers were average but very true to style. I think the Fate-ality was the best. Our server was very good and knowledgable about the beers and local options."}
{"text":"More and more, Arizona is being bombarded by breweries, and it's becoming harder for them to stand out cause, quite frankly, a lot of the beer tastes the same, the food is typical, and the \"unique\" crafts just don't tickle my tastebuds. Fortunately, Fate has a couple of those standouts that would make me want to head back over there...the chili oil and the chocolate-chili milk stout! 

I know, the chili oil? Yep. It's actually packed with great flavor that goes perfectly with any of Fate's carbohydrates (I only tried the flatbread app and potato nachos -- just okay). If you ever had the pleasure of going to a restaurant named Aiello's before it closed, you'll remember their complementary chili oil app. Fate's oil reminded me of that immediately! It's just spicy enough, and it's loaded with delicious chili, oil, and oregano flavor. The chocolate-chili stout was also perfectly spicy! The first few sips were reminiscent of any tasty chocolate/coffee milk stout, but after your palate has been engulfed with it, you start to get hints of spice that build slowly while you venture to the snifter's plinth. Delicious.

I'm looking forward to checking Fate out again, and I'm hoping the service will be a little better the next time (it was busy). And, I'll be sure to try their pizza because, c'mon, I like pizza and beer! 

Salut!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best craft beer tap rooms I have ever been to, if not the best. McFate is an institution in the Arizona craft beer community. 

For context, I started going to McFate (Fate back in the day) nearly three years ago. This neighborhood craft beer pub features excellent as well, the Jess being my personal favorite. 

Moving to the beer now... the beer is incredible, all their beers, but their IPAs belong to a different class altogether. Flip the menu to the back, to find the heavier, hoppier, bigger beer selections. Some of the crows favorites are: American Pale Ale, Fatality IPA, Double Oatmeal IPA (a photo of a double oatmeal IPA in my review). Last year (2016) they started brewing an American Pale Lager (APL) which is probably among my too 5 beers ever. 

This small pub is where they started their operations in Arizona, and they used to brew their beer here. Two dads ago (late 2015) they opened a gorgeous facility south of Old Town Scottsdale, on Scottsdale road, where they do the brewing now. I strongly recommend you to visit that facility. 

Finally, but maybe most importantly, their staff is wonderful across both locations. They're very friendly, very casual and down to earth. One of my favorite breweries in Toronto has staff that is not really friendly and that ruins the experience for you (Bellwood Brewery), so every time I'm back at McFate I really appreciate how friendly the staff is. Special mention to Fausto as his location, who is one of those friendly faces that is always up for a good chat and solid beer recommendation. 

Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Solid beer, solid pizza, solid service, solid atmosphere.  Just an all around solid place to grab a pizza and a beer.  All the reviews on here seem to be spot on so there is really nothing more that I could add."}
{"text":"Fate mixes together two of the finer things in life. Pizza and beer and they do a hell of a job at it. The fennel sausage pizza was great, love the goat cheese. The pesto pizza also a strong choice. The beers are all very good. Love the sours when they are available."}
{"text":"shared pizza and beers with the family and all GREAT things.  We tried a tasting of everything and had additional sours with our food.  The pizzas are incredible and the servers are super friendly.   Real comfortable place."}
{"text":"We stopped in after a movie to check out the \"soft\" opening.  They have it together with friendly and attentive staff.  Pizza was excellent--great flavor and fast delivery out of their great looking wood burning oven.  Their local brews taste great--the cream ale is spot on--also nice guest brews on tap--leg humper hefe is next best thing to a Franziskaner.  Lots of parking in the back--expect this place to do very well.  Simple menu, good value and cold beer!  Check it out--"}
{"text":"Glad to see a small brewery open up in Scottsdale.  Food is great, beers are good if you like hoppy, the brewer seems to have a very heavy hop hand.  A couple taps dedicated to other local brews.  Very friendly staff.  Really glad to see this place open."}
{"text":"Disappointing...a long list of beers that they brew and only 3 were checked as available - what???

Nice patio, friendly service and the wood fired pizzas looked good too, but I couldn't get past the limited types of beer offered."}
{"text":"Great place and Nice staff will return flatbread was excellent"}
{"text":"This brew pub still suffers the pains of a newly opened business. We came for a late dinner after the car auctions and found their beers a bit watery compared to Oak Creeks product, which we'd had earlier that day. Pizza is hand tossed northern italian style and while it has good ingredients, toppings were a bit hard to figure out when they arrived. room is VERY LOUD, lot s of hard surfaces.. hope these guys adjust a bit.. as they say \"it's in their hands\""}
{"text":"I recently paid a visit to a cousin in Arizona for his college graduation and decided to hit up a couple of breweries during my stay. While a good number of them were pretty underwhelming, Fate Brewing Company was the best one I went to.

Fate also happens to be a brewpub, meaning that they also make food in addition to brewing beer. While the large wood-fire pizza oven they had in the back made me tempted order a slice, I decided to stick to the beers and ordered myself a tasting flight.

And boy were they some good beers. While I won't bore you with a complete rundown of the beers I had I'll mention the two standouts: the Suburnt Sour and the Shea Connection.

The Sunburt was one of the better sour beers I have had. Unlike most other sour beers, the Suburt had other flavors you can taste besides the tartness. The Shea Connection was a collaboration brew Fate did with Scottsdale Beer Company and it had a great rye flavor with just a subtle hint of oak.

The tasting room/restaurant had a nice modern feel to it with ample seating. There are TVs on the wall where you can watch whatever sports game they have playing at the time and the service was attentive and friendly.

If you ever find yourself in Scottsdale, Arizona make sure to hit up Fate Brewing Company. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to finally check out the digs....  I like how spacious the joint was.  Although there weren't a lot of us in there, it wasn't too loud, noise didn't carry!  Tony was the Beertender....friendly, chatty chap.  He brought up that they will have a new location April/May-ish...  Looking forward to checking that out since I'm in the EV, so Shea is a haul.  They were running low on EVERYTHING...so no growler fills...  Guess, just another reason to go back.  Thanks Fate!!"}
{"text":"Easy to find, clean, friendly staff but most of all the beers I tasted were well crafted; hefeweizen, pale down unda, Irish red and stout. Well worth the stop. Some food available, wood fired pizza, did not eat though."}
{"text":"Overrated!

Pros: great beer.

Cons: Small menu and only a couple of good things on the menu. The pizza is good only half the time when it is cooked and they have a good chicken wrap. 

This place is strictly a small beer hall."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It has all of the necessities of life and nothing else.  
Each of their beers are excellent examples of their type, the pizza and salad are great.
It's small, simple and perfect.  
Home run!"}
{"text":"Good beer and wood fired pizza, seems like a winning concept. 

I love micro brews, and this place has a great in house selection. In addtion they have a wine list and brick wood fired pizzas. 

The pizza was good, but the dough was a bit bland maybe a bit more water and salt could help this dough be lighter and have a bit more flavor.

My smoked porter was great, nice body, finish and a decent gravity too. 

The walls and floors are all hard surfaces so it can get a bit loud in here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a Wed night. We had a large group so they reserved a few tables for us and extended their happy our until 8pm (ends at 6pm). Our group very much appreciated this generosity! 
I had the Mr. Pineapple beer as it seemed the lightest beer on the menu; they had I think 9 others on the Happy Hour menu. Crisp and refreshing beer. 
My husband and I shared one of the wood fired pepperoni pizzas; I think it was $12. The serving size was great for us to share... others might call this a super sized personal pizza. Maybe about 14\". It was a good pizza; sauce had a nice spice to it. Ours was slightly over cooked but our friends Margarita pizza looked perfect. That's the risk with wood fired pizza's.
The wine selection wasn't all that great and overpriced compared to what I've paid at bars... they really had restaurant prices on the wine (a $12 bottle at Bevmo is $35 here). A friend ordered a bottle of red wine and it was way too warm... in AZ you really need to have all your wine in a cooler; the room temperatures here are just too hot for wine serving. So I'd pass on the wine here and stick with the beer - but hey, it's a brewery so beer is really the way to go.
Interior is industrial looking, I liked it. They have a medium sized patio out front and a garage door at the entrance they can open to bring the spaces together. 
We had really good service too. We will def. be back to this place... perhaps I'll try a beer flight next time."}
{"text":"The service was helpful and super friendly! Went there for happy hour with full intentions of grabbing food as well. That quickly changed about two beers into our shared flight! Glad we didn't get two since we could barely finish the first. All the beers were extremely strong and their stout was legitimately a candy bar taste. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone even though I never tried the food. Much better breweries in the area."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place at all. The beer selection was very limited and the menu was very minimal as well. I would not visit again."}
{"text":"The unique beer selection alone should be enough to lure anyone here.  I never thought a brewery could possibly unseat my all time decade long favorite Four Peaks, but this place certainly comes close.  Service can be a little hit or miss as I've had to go to the bar a few times to get myself a beer.  An issue I have NEVER encountered at Four Peaks in 15 years going there.  The pizza is really good, but the real reason to venture here is definitely the unique locally crafted beer selection."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our visit to Fate. We intended to stop in just to sample some beer, but ended up ordering some salads which turned out to be surprisingly good. Not sure why i was shocked, maybe i was just happy we were able to get a tasty vegan option, with a little substituting. 

I don't recall having a beer really stand out for me, seemed like they were all good, but the imperial ipa wasn't what i hoped it would be. By all, i think they only had 3 of theirs available. So not a whole lot of their own to sample, but he's just a little guy. 

Overall, the place has a good vibe going on and was worth checking out."}
{"text":"Beer was decent and pizza was pretty good. My only advice is to let the pizza sit for a minute as the topping tend to fall off when the pizza just comes out. I enjoyed the DIPA, which was good but didn't get a chance to try the brown."}
{"text":"A great chill place to sit out on the patio and enjoy the beverage of your choice and some pizza. I went here with a group of Yelpers as Fate Brewing was the payoff after hiking Pinnacle Peak on our Hike & Brew UYE.

First of all, the service was outstanding and individual checks were written without any fuss. It was gorgeous day outside for some conversation, drinks and food. I had the sausage pizza with goat cheese sans the mushrooms. That pizza was wall to wall sausage. I unfortunately negated the calories I burned hiking by eating that pizza but my tummy was very happy. The pizza tasted very good and was reasonably priced.

I might have to try some other items next time but to tell you the truth it would be hard to pass up on that pizza."}
{"text":"Well, my husband and I were on the hunt for a new brewery to check out.  He works across the street and had been mentioning we should try it.  We finally got a day off together this past Saturday and decided this was the day.  LOVE the atmosphere first off.  The wait staff we friendly and very attentive. I believe our waiter's name was AJ and he was very helpful and friendly.  We started out with a Lumberjack Rasberry (which was on a special draft) and their Hef.  Uh-Maz-Ing for both.  We also ordered a House Salad to split and a Mediterranean Pizza to split.  Again Uh-Maz-Ing!!  I ordered a couple more Hefs and the hubby ordered their IPA that was on draft and then a Hef to close out our tab.  We were sooooo impressed, we will be back later this week and have even been talking about having my 40th Birthday celebration there in a month!!  WELL WORTH IT AND CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE MORE GREAT TIMES HERE"}
{"text":"Solid craft brewery.  $4 HH pints and nice selection of snacks plus a $13 daily pizza special.  Don't really dig folks bringing big hairy dogs inside a place where food is served - but hey - it's pretty much a bar.  If your into micro-brews - this should be one of your regular happy hour watering holes...  I will be back."}
{"text":"I like trying new things. Its fun and hip. While killing some time before doing side work on a Sunday, I did a Yelp Search and *poof* Fate Brewing popped up. Lets review:

~Fud/Drink~
The food here is pretty urban and \"gastropub-ish\" if you ask me. I had the Scarlet Skillet Omelet (see pic) which was very good. Everything mixed together very well, even if it looks like something your cat yacked up....it was very good. I ordered a bloody beer (they actually name it that on the menu, score) with their light ale.  All their dishes look good, prices are a tad high but the quality is there. Of the crafts they brew, all but 1 was dark or very hoppy, which is why they lose a whole star. The variety simply was not there if you like anything relatively light or refreshing.

Even the ale they gave me was a Pale Ale which, I am not a fan of. It had the traditional PA hoppy kick. It tasted good with my bloody mix in it...but still, where is the variety? The guest beers were also all very hoppy or dark, so even if I jumped over to the guest list its difficult. I know its winter, but not every winter beer HAS to be dark... I am still getting used to dark beers, so I am totally up to trying new things... but give me variety!!!

~Atmosphere/Service~
This place has a hipster feel to it. A lot of ironic items throughout, like the tool bench drawer used to cart off used growlers or old drinks...or some of the chairs which are made out of random materials. The large stone bar-top is inviting and spacious, allowing for a lot of items to be strewn across. A comparable amount of tables are inside, as well as a short-but-sweet patio up front. Service was good, one barkeep for the lot of us at the bar on a Sunday is OK. He was helpful and gave me a couple samples to try. Nothing overwhelming in either direction...nice guy.  It definitely has an open, relaxing feel to it. Really relaxing and comforting place to head over to on a Sat-Sun morning, I feel. You won't look/feel like an alchy if you come in for a drink or two and get some brunch.

~The Down Low~
Good solid spot to unwind, upscale in some aspects, with an emphasis on hipsterism in some areas. Come on down, its a fun place to be as you can tell that a lot of beer enthusiasts come here. They get 4 stars for fun/refreshing set-up, good mix on menu, well made craft beers, and an inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, thought we'd give it a try. Very small venue located in an unassuming strip mall. My initial thoughts were not promising. It was hot and crowded inside. When we finally received a menu, I knew right away what I wanted.  Cuppa Jose Milk Stout, amazing and definitely worth going back for. (Oh, and the AC kicked on eventually)"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week. They always have new beers. Their Table Saison and Imperial Coffee Stout is super yummy. Great pizza and nice service!"}
{"text":"Small gem hidden in a strip center, community tables, first come first serve.  Menu is limited to pizza and a couple of salads and appetizers, but they were all good (had three different types of pizza with a group to share).  They are a micro brew and it was AZ beer week, so the \"theme\" that night was all their beers (other times they have their own plus other brands) we had several different ones. I had the cream ale and it was a good option for me since I am more of a wine and domestic beer drinker :) not too heavy and very smooth.  It was a cool vibe, laid back and not stuffy at all.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Run how a microbrewery should be run! Equipment on display. Limited, but decent food (minus the Irish Nachos...), attentive wait staff, good service with the staff being unapologetic for unanticipated demand in beers leading to limited beer choices. And, most importantly, a welcoming place you could call home.

What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Was it destiny that brought us to Fate? Or did Fate become our destiny?

McFate's specializes in wood-fired pizza and small batch beers with fun names like \"Oh My Gatos!\", \"Totes McOats\" and \"Fate-Ality\". Not a very large spot to hang out so expect the possibility of a little bit of a wait, but the servers were relatively attentive despite being ultra, mega, super busy. 

Personally, I'm a cider gal so I was happy to see that they offer Ciderboys Strawberry Magic in bottles. Which if you have never sampled before, Strawberry Magic smells like a daydream of skipping through fields of strawberries and sunshine (and tastes equally as wonderful)!!

We tried a pizza with half, Truff N Stuff - olive oil, mozzarella, red onion, arugula, shaved parmesan, and lemon truffle vinaigrette and half, The Jess - cheese, baby spinach, bacon, roasted garlic. While Truff N Stuff was good, The Jess was definitely the standout and full of flavor. Yum!

Really pleased with this visit and can't wait to try McFate's - South sometime as well!"}
{"text":"Adding a bit of what else makes a venue special - it's the people and the service. Some of the staff that I've met include Fausto, Terry, A.J., Brandon, Travis, and Summer. Terry has moved on, but he was one great ex-dreadlocked barkeep. I think it was that he had to get married and get serious with life.
Fausto, Travis and Summer are great, they remember who you are, they check back with you regularly, and they remember what you like. 
It's the follow-through when you're delivering an order, whether it's a single customer or a gaggle, a single beer or a feast, it's important to meet the customers' eyes when the product is delivered. There's nothing worse than having the employee set the order down but be talking or concentrating on someone else at that moment. Without that moment of connection, the delivery seems like an afterthought. I've rarely had to be on the other side of the transaction, so all i can say is I appreciate the demands on the employee, but as a customer, that' moment of connection makes me believe that the server knows that I'm there.
The crowd gets bigger as the week moves on. Mondays and Tuesdays are quiet, even into Happy Hour. And by the way, the Happy Hour deals are good.
Fate's my neighborhood brewery, I appreciate the work of McFate and his team for their entrepreneurial and beer-making skills and passion!"}
{"text":"They hit the nail on the head at Fate: the craft beer, artisan pizza, and chill atmosphere definitely make it an enjoyable place to go eat and hang out. I recommend the capicola pizza with the pale ale. Get a flight of 5 your first time, of course."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place, and one of two locations for this brewery. The beers here are well made, clean and free from off flavors. Service was friendly and attentive, I did not try the food!!
I had several samplers of the beer and I can honestly say I enjoyed them all!!
The place is small but cozy, the newer location on Scottsdale Road is much bigger!
This is a stop worth making if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Friendly  and inviting atmosphere. 
Fantastic beers. IPA'S are to die for. 
Killer pizzas.  The model works."}
{"text":"First time to Fate and it won't be my last! We came in for lunch knowing nothing about this place other than they make beer and pizza. Both were very good!  I started with the double IPA being it has a 100 IBU and a specific gravity of 8.5! Nice start! I ordered the Sunnyside pizza and was not disappointed in any fashion. The crust was thin and crispy all the way to the center. If you like the pies at Pane Bianco or Pizzeria Bianco you'll like these just as well (although the dough is not as salty). Also try some of the chili oil. I always like a little extra oil on my pizza and this was just what I like, a little extra flavor and a bump in heat. 
The menu isn't large, which is good, because it allows them to concentrate on what they do best. 
Very good overall including the service."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Fate to open up, I had even tracked their progress a bit while they were in construction phase.

I am glad to say my first visit did not disappoint.

Beers:
Smoked Porter - interesting
Irish Red ale - tasty
Imperial IPA - yummy
American Brown ale - good

They only have one Appetizer which is the pizza sticks.  Basically cheese covered breadsticks with a side of marinara for dipping.  It was good.

Hubby ordered the Rustica pizza - garlic olive oil, artichoke hearts, roasted red bell pepper, capicola, gorgonzola cheese.  Since I am not a fan of gorgonzola cheese, I did not really eat it.  I did take a bite to see how well excuted the pizza was, and I must say I found it pretty good with a great crust.  Even though  I had enjoyed the couple bites of pizza, I stopped because the gorgonzola taste would eventually overwhelm me and then I would hate it.  But hubby loved it.

Cake pops were pretty good too.  Had the snickerdoodle and the red velvet. 

Service was friendly and efficient.

Solid place I will come back to."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed lunch here. Outdoor patio has lots of shady seating. We had the Jess Pizza on gf crust. Garlic oil with motzerella, spinach, bacon, roasted garlic, and ricotta. The crust was nice and crispy. The flavor was great and we enjoyed it.

The salads looked good and I heard they have great beer selection, although I'm not a beer drinker."}
{"text":"When guests are in town, we take them here for beer. The staff is always so friendly and they know how to brew a good cold one. Don't skimp out on the food, their pizzas and bar bites are top notch. I wouldn't change a thing about this brewery."}
{"text":"Their American Pale Ale is one of my favorites, on the order of Sierra Nevada if you like that. They also have a good selection of guest taps as well which rotate regularly. 

Their pizzas are good and their salads generously portioned. So are the pretzels, but I don't often get them cause they are really filling. 

The service here is excellent. There can be a longer wait for a table on busy nights as there are a limited number of seats here in this location."}
{"text":"As the Duchess of McFate I am honored to review them & give them 5 stars! I obviously frequent this gem spot often, making it one of my go to spots for great food, great brews & great atmosphere. I'm never disappointed. Travis & Tony are exceptional employees with an over achieving attitude. We are always greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. As far as some of my favorite brews & bites, here they are (in no particular order) Oh my Gators (brew) Candy Bar Milk Stout (seasonal brew) Green Flash (guest beer) The Jess (pizza) The Con Carne (pizza) Twists of Fate (app) The McFatta Platta (app) & the Caprese Salad. They have a rotating food menu as well as a rotating brew selection, so you are always able to try something new.  My tastebuds crave their delightful dishes as least once a week. If you have never been here, you're seriously missing out! It's worth the commute if you don't live local. They also have a location in Old Town Scottsdale. Give them a shot! I promise you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection. Order pretzel, mustard is outstanding as well as the pretzel. Unique beers like Mexican hot chocolate, horchata and candy bat stouts. All very good."}
{"text":"Great experience... Beers a little too hoppy for my taste, but fun times and yummy pretzel!!"}
{"text":"What a great find. Had 2 different microbrews-one with a hint of banana & the other a lighter shift ale that was super flavorful. Then had great Irish Nachos which were made with thinly sliced potatoes. Also had pretzels with cheese and spicy mustard. Pizza was great. We had staff special Hoagie pizza & fennel sausage with mushroom. All of it was awesome! Wait staff was great. They all work together so we really didn't have to wait for or flag down a server. Would definitely return. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Beer was good, but not over the top memorable. New place had high ceilings that just echoed all the noise of the place.
Good joint, but really loud with some obnoxious college girls talking loud on their phones.  The bartender was more interested in flirting with them than giving good service to people that actually tip for good service....."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - George Michael - Faith)

Well I guess it would be nice
If I could taste your craft beer
I know not everybody 
has got a brewery like yours

But I've got to sip twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you will play 
Because it's on Direc TV Too!

Oh But I 
Need some Pizza
From that hunger cry
Time to pick my fork up off the plate

Oh, When that pie comes out 
With that aroma
Well, It takes a strong appetite Baby
But I'm showin you my mouth

Cause' I gotta have Fate
I gotta have Fate
Because I gotta have Fate, a Fate, a Fate
I gotta have Fate, a Fate, a Fate

Fate is a local brewing company located in Scottsdale.  There used to be life around here back in the days when Devil's Martini existed.  Still some small hot spots here and there; the there is Fate.  The only beer brewing restaurant around; this cute little brewery spices up the night life back into the area.

I shared the olive side and a capicola pizza with a pal.  If you like olives this was a delight.  Nicely dripping in it's own juice with a salty punch to your palates.  The firewood pizza that we ordered was okay I thought.  The crust got dried out quickly and the toppings did the same.  Kept on drinking to finish it off!  

Drinking was not what I did here though.  I'm not a big fan of craft beers, but can appreciate it.  We sampled all their beers and my favorite and also strongest was the Belgo American Tripel.  Strong indeed cause I started to buzz a little after one!  Light weight here!  Anyways, the other beer were strong also and extra bitter to me.  Almost like an IPA which I despise!  All you IPA drinkers can hate...go ahead.  

Overall, the atmosphere is great and the service was awesome.  Drinks were fine, but not my cup of tea and the food was okay. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times recently and have been very impressed with what McFate has to offer. The beer is obviously the main attraction and I'm a huge (yuuuuge) fan of their Fateful IPA (6.6% ABV 85 IBU) and their Hibiscus Pale (5.4% ABV 40 IBU). The bar staff is always more than willing to help you choose something perfect for you and even recommends mixing certain beers to create something magical! 

I've had a few of their pizzas, but the best is by far the Sticky Fingers with garlic oil, mozzarella, Serrano ham, arugula, and habanero honey drizzle. The habanero is just spicy enough without being overwhelming and the honey provides the sweet balance. Service has always been fast and friendly. I'll continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I am not much of beer drinker but I had a lot of them here on Sunday morning for breakfast. Hahaha, I know! I justified myself by adding orange juice first.

First one I ordered was beermosa. Pick light beer and orange juice. It tasted more like fuzzy orange juice. 

If you order breakfast pizza (they add egg to pizza and call it breakfast pizza), two 5 oz beer is included. I picked two of the last one on the list. Stout and Irish something. Both of them were very good, quite tasty, I learned I prefer dark beer. (Just to note, I didn't drive several hours after drinking).

Nice little brewery here with good service and good beer. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes great. The beer however, is extremely bitter, no matter which kind you get. I got a sampler flight of all the beers and couldn't choke down one of any of the samplers. I'm a Stella/Kiltlifter kind of guy, and this beer is definitely not my taste. 

I thought the homemade root beer had to bring some redemption. Wrong again. It was flat. 

Service and atmosphere are good, prices are expeeensive for what you get. Probably not going to return. I can see why some folks like it but it's not for everyone."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews I was glad to finally make it up here. This place a a small, smart, cheerful no-nonsense place for beer lovers to come enjoy some craft beer. I can't comment on the food because I was on a strict liquid bread diet when I came in. But their wood-fired pizzas look good....next time.

I ordered a flight that kept my occupied for a while. I think my favorite was the American Pale Ale, believe it or not. but I also really enjoyed their Irish Red. I also followed this by the Grand Canyon Pils which I thoroughly enjoyed as well.

They have a nice bar area and the servers are great. You can really tell that they are beer enthusiasts themselves and that makes the experience enjoyable. I recommend this place highly if you want to have a beer or two in a friendly, relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best beer in town. Loved this place before they opened the new on, so I'm super happy they're doing well. Quality food and drinks, but a pretty laid back atmosphere. Not wild like four peaks, with a pretty clean an classy ambiance. Still small enough of an operation to know most of the servers by name, and the beer is always solid. Go for the pizzas. They're bistro quality. Love the Pablo Honey and the Jess. 

Simple. Classy. Solid. This place needs to be found more often."}
{"text":"Atmo?  Comfy; neighborhood-y.

Beer?  Tasty.  I had the stout.  

Pizza?  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  A waste of a good wood for the joint's  wood-fired oven. The crust had absolutely no flavor.  Devoid of salt.  No carbon burn from the oven. Flatter than the desert's floor.  No bubbles in the crust.  My pizza came with a sunnyside egg.  The egg was sunnyside decimated and the white was runny.  

And with this review I do solemnly swear that I will never finish a restaurant meal if it is not good.  If the first bite is terrible, back it goes to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I walked in about 6 PM on Friday and this place was packed.  I found a seat at the end of the bar near the TV and I was good to go.

I started out with their Irish Red beer.  It tasted very good and I liked it a little better than the cream ale that I had later.

I ordered the capicola pizza and it was very spicy and flavorful.  I'm not 100% sure I totally like the crust but overall I enjoyed my meal.

It looks like Fate will be a success!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breweries in AZ! Steve and his staff are so friendly and they allow dogs on the patio. I love their belgians, ales and IPAs."}
{"text":"I kind of found the place a bit on the dull side, but it was in Scottsdale, so probably par for the course. Speaking of courses, you can't throw a water scarcity without hitting 2 in these parts.

But I had a flight and the beers were good."}
{"text":"OK beer, but not as good as many other local breweries. Pizza was mediocre so if you go there spend the money on beer, not food."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great beer selection! We ate outside next to heat lamps and corn hole. Everyone loved their food. The restaurant and outdoor area are very spacious! The waitress was great to us!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this brewery and it was very enjoyable.  We got a table out on the patio and enjoyed the warm air and the nice view of Shea!  I ordered a sour and it was delicious, the perfect beer to sip, while enjoying the fresh baked pizza.  The servers were very friendly and more than accommodating.  We will definitely be back again in the near future."}
{"text":"The bartender was prompt but not friendly, he seemed a bit pretentious. The ipa was surprisingly good and my sister enjoyed the food I brought her from the restaurant. I'll be back since her salon is right next door , but it won't be for the sparkling service or conversation."}
{"text":"Single hop sour- the next hot beer for people looking for a change from IPA!  Hatch chili cream is also amazing."}
{"text":"First time eating here. It's small and intimate. We had the cheese sticks and pizza. Both were good, but the pizza was a little salty for my taste. I added some marinara from the cheese sticks which fixed the pizza right on up. I would go back if it wasn't so far out. I live on the West Side of town."}
{"text":"Don't let the roadside appearance fool you. This is a very Worthy Brew Pub to stop at. The beer choices are excellent in the food is way above average. We stopped here in January while on a conference trip. The place was so good we went back a second night that week rather than trying out another Brewery."}
{"text":"My family loved Fate Brewing Company!

We went to Fate for dinner expecting good beer. We got that plus a whole lot more.

As an appetizer we started with the pizza bread. It was a great start to our meal with some red sause and spicy oil to dip it in. Good for both kiids and parents.

My daughters are picky eaters but loved their in house brewed root beer and the pizza (pepperoni and  a rosemary roasted potato). They finished it off with a cake pop. Perfect.

As far as mom and dad - we enjoyed a sampler of five beers. My wife loved the cream ale and the pale ale. I thought the red and double IPA were great as well.  The smoke porter was a pleasant surprise to me. I am not a dark beer drinker but loved the taste of this beer. I can totally see drinking this along side of something lighter next time I go.

As far as food - I had the Molto Carne (pepperoni and sausage).  It had a little spice which I really liked. My wife had a salad with chicken on it. She said the meat had flavor and said she'd eat it again.

The staff was attentive and friendly.  They were knowledgable about the menu and the beer selection. I wasn't at the bar, but the bartenders seemed to have good rapport with their customers.

Bottom line - me and my family will be back to Fate.  If you like good beer, good food, and friendly people - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fate is great for microbrews and brick-oven pizza.  All of the pizzas that I've tried (vegetarian) have been pretty great.  The olive appetizer is also nice.  Lots of microbrews on tap as well as some local brews.  No wait (at least not so far), so that is a plus during the cool months.  I'm hoping this can remain a somewhat unknown neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time back at Fate's, 1st time I really didn't have anything but a glass of water, being DD and all, so I didn't think it warranted a review. 

This time I was with a group of friends, we met up for a Hike and Brew, and Fate Brewing was the placed picked for the brew part of the day.

Our server was Fausto, he was great! Told him I had to be the party pooper of the group and order fast & leave soon, but he didn't miss a beat, took my order and got me my drink! 

Still being new to ordering beers (the number of beers I have drank in my lifetime can be counted on one hand) I checked out the list of beers and went with the Irish Red,  it's a cooper red malted focused with an initial caramel sweetness & roasted dryness in the finish. Now the way I happened upon my 1st beer, which was a stout, someone said they are like coffee, I like coffee, ok I love coffee, so it has to be good right? So this Irish Red said caramel sweetness, yes I like that too, so that's how I picked Irish Red, and I have to say I was pretty happy with my choice. Very good, can't wait to try it again!

I was a little bit hungry, but not enough for an meal, so I ordered off the starter menu and got the Potato Nachos, now in the past when I have ordered potato nachos I always regret doing it because I like thick slices of potatoes covered in cheese and goodness not the paper thin slices, I'm a potato luv fool!  But this time I was not disappointed, it was potato slices, but not thin, but not too thick just perfectly right, covered in mozzarella cheese, topped with BACON, red onions, roasted garlic sour cream & chives. This plate of nachos was out of sight! Before I knew it, I ate it all! So dang good!

Glad to have made it back to Fate's and actually tried some beer & food this time :) Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service starting with hostess and manager.  The pale ale was awesome. Reminds me of Mirror Pond.

Pizzas are very good."}
{"text":"I went to Fate for the first time yesterday. My wife and I had a sampler of five beers, which were not bad at all. However it was the service that really made me lower this rating. 

For example, one of the servers pulled up a bar stool and sat on it for an extended amount of time, talking to her boyfriend, the bar tender, while encroaching on my wife's personal space. 

In addition, the bar tender gave very little attention to my wife and I and wasn't even looking at us when we ordered a margarita pizza (which was ok tasting). 

The business was busy when we went, but with service like we received, it won't stay that way forever."}
{"text":"Love this place!! nice vibe, great food, delicious beer, and AJ IS AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Although my hubby would award it 2.25 stars, I am not as harsh.  I loved my Belgian wit.  It was like Four peaks peach ale minus the peach.  Very refreshing!  We got potato nachos and they were different because they were cooked in their brick pizza oven, but we weren't huge fans."}
{"text":"Well I gotta say I'm disappointed I didn't try this place sooner. Small menu but the main dish served which is pizza was great. Now we only tried one but assuming how good this one was I can only imagine the rest are swell. As far as the beers, well I tried three different ones. The irish red, American brown ale and double oatmeal ipa which were all amazing. Clear looking and very smooth tasting."}
{"text":"great place, great beer!  I would recommend the potato Nachos.  Great food great service.  yum"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! My husband and I ate here about a week ago.  The inside is a perfect mix of rustic and contemporary decor.  The staff was great,  the beers were awesome, the food fresh, and the cake pops amazing. We also chatted with the owner for a bit - he is very committed, knowledgeable and personable.  I hope Fate is around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best milk stout I've ever tasted. Definitely coming back. Pizza was good too."}
{"text":"Double Oatmeal IPA was delicious, and the Red was really great too. There were lots of selections on tap, the atmosphere was great to surround yourself with friends, and the pies were reasonably priced, and delicious. I had the pablo honey- and it was outstanding. The wait staff seemed a bit overwhelmed, but handled it well. Overall, a good experience, good service, and good food."}
{"text":"We checked Yelp driving down from Las Vegas and found Fate.  Was it fate?  We were impressed by prior reviews so took the leap, and are pleased we did!  Fausto, our server, was a delight - attentive, knowledgeable and prompt in every way.  We enjoyed our meal - the margherita pizza was excellent with shredded basil over the entire surface, and the Red Irish Ale was a delight.  The unexpected bonus was their guest brew from Funkwerks in Fort Collins, CO, which was their King Tropic brew.  We had this at Funkwerks taproom in July, 2013, and it was superb, 8.2 ABV, and full of flavor.  It is worth the trip just for this beer alone, but that discounts Fate's Oatmeal Stout - a grand stout full of flavor and delicious from start to finish.  This is a new micro-brewery celebrating their one year anniversary.  Join them and enjoy every bite and every brew!"}
{"text":"Came on the 19th of March, best pizza yet and we've been here dozens of times!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the pizza is delicious. We ordered four different pizzas for group of 7 guys & had two pieces left over!  All 4 were very tasty!  Casual but nice environment"}
{"text":"Had the Truff n Stuff pizza, it was honestly the best pizza I have ever ate. Washed it down with a Buffet Brown, that was one great beer... so I had another.  Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, esp. For Sunday brunch, and GREAT beer. The place is comfy, with a great patio. The glow of the pizza oven radiates ambiance, even in the heat of summer."}
{"text":"Love this little place in Scottsdale!  Fantastic pizza!  Good people.  Servers know their stuff!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Irish Red and the pale ale. Pizza was good and the potato nachos were VERY good!"}
{"text":"Great bar, with excellent service! Didn't get five feet in the door and was greeted with a smile. I sat down at the bar and had instant service, I ordered the coffee milk stout and would recommend to anyone who enjoys a dark beer."}
{"text":"Just a short walk from our hotel this gem was a sweet find on Yelp! The friendly & fast service was outdone only by the delicious craft beer selection and fantastic wood-fired pizza! Go, you'll love it too."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. Let me say for being a smaller brewery/restaurant they are doing it so right. There was not a beer that I had there which I did not like. In fact I loved the ones I had. They were so unique and different.  Also their pizzas are bursting with flavor and fresh ingredients. They also have a secret oil sauce that you can put on your pizza or anything you order that kicks up the flavor. Great place I am already planning a return trip."}
{"text":"OMG this place is the bomb.com! I had a couple friends who used to work there recommend it to me and if I could go back every day to eat their food and drink their yummy beer (without becoming an alcoholic haha), I would! 

Ordered the Oatmeal Crisp which was perfect for the time of year. Light and crisp (as the name suggests). For food, we got the Sow Sweet...... this is TO DIE FOR.  It's a white sauce pizza with prosciutto, fig jam, apples and goat cheese - holy mouth watering goodness! I was so full but I wanted to eat more and then order another to go (sadly I did not). 

The staff there was very helpful and never overbearing. The space is smaller but I don't mind that. There's plenty of seating for bigger groups as well even though the space may not be as big as some of the big box restaurants. 

Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Arizona Brewery by far.  As far as this location the staff is great, friendly, helpful, FUNNY and just plain the best!   One of my favorite things is it's always CLEAN.  I am a bit of a germ-a-phob and if there are signs like unclean dishes, dirty tables and floors or bathrooms - you won't see me back for a second visit.   And I've been here a gabillion times.   The pizzas are amazing; my favorite is the Peggyrita with pepperoni - trying to get it added to the menu as The PeppiRita ;-) I love McFate!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative pizzas with awesome beer! If I was a local I would definitely come back and often!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fate more than a handful of times and have always had a great experience.  Even though their newer, larger location is closer to where I currently live, I always take the longer trip to this one.  

Employees are friendly and the service is excellent.  I love the Pablo Honey pizza.  Beers are always refreshing and they typically have something new to offer each time I drop by.  

Also, the habanero oil that they have for your pizza is amazing.  I love the added kick it gives my pizza as my boyfriend who usually tags along is not a fan of spicy."}
{"text":"Great selection of brews, yummy pizza, and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"One of the best microbrewery in AZ. Wood fired pizzas are amazing and the beer is by far one of the best out there. Steve the owner and Adam the head brewer are always friendly and serve up great beers and food. If you have not been here, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"High end brewpub with great decor, great beer, great food, great service

Went here twice in one day it was so good and had to bring my family here. Modern, wood decor. Beers ranged from good to ridiculous with some beers being the best I'd had all month. Sours, Berliners, ancho chili stouts, pilsner crisp like APAs. House beers dominate the tight tap list, only one guest tap. Sampler flights allowed at 5 at a time served in mini flute and well organized. Food is pretty much all pizza, but what we had was very good. Service was friendly and check up on us quite a bit. Outdoor patio with heat lamps is a plus. Overall, my favorite place so far in the Phoenix area and will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for the anniversary party so I wasn't able to actually take a seat and grab some food - it was way over capacity. I tried a vanilla cocoa smoked porter and it was very heavy and over the top on the smoke flavour. I'm more of a fruit-infused beer drinker, though, and there wasn't anything on the brew menu that catered to that. I would come back on a normal business day to try the pizza or some of the lighter beers, but a brewery with such a small variety of beers and no beer-based foods is not what I'm usually looking for in a brewery - but if you're into trying new beers, definitely check them out. They had some unique flavours!"}
{"text":"As a beer fan, Ive wanted to try this place since it opened.

Even though this place was the backup we didn't end up needing, I seized the opportunity to try it anyway. We were seated immediately and both our servers were attentive an pleasant. This place is gorgeous. Lots of different woods, a beautiful bar, and a view into their brewing room from all parts of the restaurant.

Myself and 2 of my fellow Yelpers opted for the flight +1 (all 6 of their brews featured at the time). My faves includes their Irish red (which I'm not usually a fan of), their American pale ale, and the Saison. Nice, refreshing and crisp. I was not a fan of their hefe, really not. There was a note of something I can not put my finger on that did not agree w/ my taste buds.

If you're a craft beer fan, I'd definitely recommend stopping in for a pint or flight."}
{"text":"Love that they are dog friendly on the patio - they were even kind enough to bring out water dishes for our dogs. Great beer and excellent pizza is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"As a Craft Beer junky I was not overly impressed with the beer. I guess I can thank my West Coast IPA pallette for that. I will give 2 thumbs up to Porter. Big beer but very easy to drink with a great finish...I was impressed!

The food - had Reuben with tater tots and fries - SOLID!

Service - Antonio (Anthony) was spot on - allowed us to take our time and was knowledgeable around the beer menu (a plus coming from a beer snob)

My hopes is Fate brews a more traditional West Coast DIPA in the near future as I am in Scottsdale all the time for work and will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've been there several times and tried many beers, as they're always rotating. Everything is great (the Chili Milk Stout and the Strawberry Rhubarb have been my favorites). The food is also delicious; they recently changed their menu to include more than pizza. It can be a little pricy, but it's a great date spot."}
{"text":"Found these guys on yelp last night and after reading the great reviews and seeing the great looking food thought we would give them a try. Saw on yelp and later their website they were open till 11pm, Saturday's. We got their at 10pm and saw what appeared to be three employees talking behind the bar. There were two customers at the bar and two more seated in the restaurant area. Although the employees looked at us walk in, no one acknowledged our existence. The three of us sat down at a table thinking someone would come give us menus and take drink orders. No one bothered coming over to us or greeting us. After approximately 5-10 minutes we left without ever talking to an employee. They may have decent beer, decent food, but their service is unacceptable and if continues I'd assume even in Scottsdale they'll die off because people have better service options serving similar fare.

We went a couple miles west to OHSO Brewery had a great time."}
{"text":"Fate, IMHO, is the best brewery in Arizona, and currently my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. What continuously excites and surprises me is not just the quality if the beer, but the consistency in excellence. I have been here quite a few (10+) times and have never walked away disappointed. Their beer is always delicious and their descriptions are always spot on. I would recommend a few beers, but chances are they will not be on tap when you are there as they are constantly rotating. The food is the same, excellent and consistent. The Jess and Pablo Honey are my personal favorite pizzas, but am regularly impressed with the rotating special pizzas. The atmosphere is good, if a bit simple. I like that you can see the brewing area but that it is separated by glass. I dig that the taps are skateboard trucks as well. The staff have always been courteous and knowledgeable about brews. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local brewery! Delicious brews and tasty pizza! I consider myself to be a foodie and beer snob and this place is definitely worth checking out. Their Red was really good. Get the beer flight to try all if their beers and then determine your own favorite!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Ashlee was our server and it was fun to visit with her. She knew her beers, is a hop head, and directed me to the Double Oatmeal IPA which was amazing. They had a good brunch menu; I had the classic breakfast pizza and my wife had the bacon and mushroom frittata skillet.

As we waited for our food and I enjoyed the Double Oatmeal IPA, Ashlee brought over samples of the other Fate brews saying she enjoyed talking to craft brew fans and wanted us to taste their other beers as well. I tend toward IPAs and the pale ale was excellent but I was surprised by the red, absent the over-sweet maltiness I've tasted in a lot of microbrews of that style. It was dark but not heavy, with just enough hop to balance the malt or rye. I ended up taking home a growler of the red though I'd planned on a growler of the Pale Ale, both for the variety and because it was so good. Truth be told, I also took home a \"growlerette\" of the Double Oatmeal IPA. The \"growlerette\" was a cool small growler with a flip top that would be reused and enjoyed by home brewers, and is just cool looking.

Matching the beer, the food was very good. My classic breakfast pizza had olive oil, bacon, rosemary roasted potatoes, mozzarella, cracked egg and was finished with fresh herb. It was a nine inch pizza with a crisp crust. The egg, cheese, and potatoes matched well and contrasted with the crunch of the crust. My wife's frittata was also very good and she commented more than once on the flavor of the rosemary roasted potatoes coming through. Hers was served in a small cast iron skillet on a board with pegs holding it in place. The server who brought the food to our table noted our choices and said we were in for a treat. He was right. Ashlee came by and noticed I'd not eaten the crust of the pizza and she suggested trying the pepper oil on the table with the crust. I turned out I cleaned the plate with the pepper oil and crust.

Service, food, and beer were all top notch. In our family we have a tradition of choosing a restaurant for our birthdays and, for the last few years, my choice has been either Four Peaks in Tempe or San Tan Brewery in Chandler. While I still love both of those breweries, Fate will be where I draw my family from across the valley for my next birthday.

Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic.  We tried the margherita and the pepperoni, both of which we loved!  Between us, we tried all their current beers on tap.  My Mom loved the Irish Red, Dad loved the Belgo, and I had a Fate Imperial IPA and a Black IPA, both of which were fantastic.  Especially dug the Black IPA, love to see those!  Our server Steven was so nice and helpful and the manager, Ben, was wonderful as well.  This is a great place to drop in and have a beer, love that you can see the brewing equipment as well as the kitchen, it really adds to the awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My friend and I initially came for Dirty Dogg Saloon, but there was an event so we decided to go to McFate; this place has been on my list for awhile now, so I suppose it was meant to be. We started off with two nitro beers, both were amazing, but I cannot remember the names and it's not on their website. 

I was starving so I ordered the Roasted Grape salad and the Sticky Fingers pizza due to the delicious habanero honey. I ended up ordering a side of it because it was so damn good! And yes, I did have sticky fingers and no, they do not have wet wipes.  Let me tell yah, it was so hard for me to hold myself back, I only ate 3 slices, but I wanted to eat the whole pizza! Gotta watch my figure though. ;) 
With regard to the roasted grape salad, it was fantastic, but next time I will be asking for the dressing on the side as it came mixed in. 

The customer service was excellent - the bartender we had was knowledgeable and hilarious. He recommended I should order the buffalo chicken wrap with habanero honey next time I am in, so I will probably do that next week. 

All in all, this place was fantastic and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice evening tried a few beers and the pretzel app.    Great beers and atmosphere.    Sat at the bar and learned a great deal about the beers and how they make them.   Met some great people that shared other places with us we should try in the neighborhood.   Service was great and everyone made for a nice evening."}
{"text":"Went here and tried the Irish Red that they brew.....Not bad but I have had better. The pizza here though is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Updating my review; 
Fate Brewing didn't blow me away on my first visit, just happened that most of their beers were big and strong. But, I gave them a few more tries and they totally won me over. I've stopped in about a dozen times now and it's becoming one of my favorite breweries to go to. On my first visit, the beers didn't do much for me, but the nice thing is that they are always coming up with new and better brews all the time. The last few times I've come in, they have had some really great pale ales, IPAs and they seem to specialize in stouts as they are some of the few I drink. The food is also amazing; they have wood-fired pizzas that are all terrific and delicious. Also, their happy hour small bites make it a go-to happy hour spot for me. The staff is also very cool, very friendly and happy to let you know about the brews going on and what to expect. So I recommend Fate for happy hour and dinner for a pizza a beer; what could be better?"}
{"text":"Not bad, good ambience for a brewery. It was relevant enough for guys to go grab some beers there and also for young families to come by.

I need to come here more /try more of their beers to give you my opinion.

They have some other beers on tap...orange shanty is nasty...but you all knew that already.

Go for their beers instead"}
{"text":"Pretty good, no complaints. We tried the coffee stout which was great and the IPA was okay.  I just wasn't really blown away by the place, but would go back."}
{"text":"A must !! I have been to all the breweries in Arizona  , and this is the best!!  Arizona is trying to find a beer identify  and these guys here at fate will set the mark!!!

Always great beer"}
{"text":"Walked over from the Hampton Inn for a beer and light dinner. We had some great beer, salad and pizza. Was a little noisy but definitely a fun place. Service was also great."}
{"text":"Come here quite a bit ... Short n sweet; small spot, great food, friendly staff (shout out to my boy Tony one of the bartenders), chill spot but surprisingly I'm not crazy about a lot of the handles. The taps rotate regularly but after all the times I've been I haven't found a draft that I've been crazy about .. The pretzels n pizza are must try. Just saying!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Misty was our amazing bartender. We also found out she was the one that invented the pizza special the evening we went there. So good! We look forward to returning to the fabulous hospitality and a great selection of ice cold beer."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour menu -- only minimal savings off regular priced menu items, but fine. Food is ok. Beer is tasty. Service is meh. Fine if you don't have any questions about the menu, etc. Nice guy but much more interested in talking about anything other than the food or beer. Very nice. But I did come for the food and beer. 

Would I come back? Maybe. There's probably better but it definitely wasn't bad. Just meh. So if you're looking for a meh experience with decent beer and a similar happy hour menu, check it out."}
{"text":"I try not to give a lot of 5 star reviews but this is one of my favorite places for pizza, beer and their even salads. Service is awesome If you go their more than a couple of times the serves will probably know your name and what beer you drink. For beer drinkers the bartenders are aways happy to pore you a sample their beer to help you find your favorite.  Their beer is one of the best in the state and my favorite.  If they have the Nelson Shmelson they rarely do you have to try.  They did expand the menu from the south location still working out a few kinks but good."}
{"text":"Great new craft brewery offering a rotating tap, wood fired pizzas.   Great wide variety of pizzas including a rosemary potato; red peppers and goat cheese; you name it. The day I was there, they had 3 beers on tap including a delicious IPA. I'm curious to have the Saison and Cream ale when they next appear.  Excellent patio as well."}
{"text":"Had the beer flight and the Irish red. Nothing really jumps out as great but the Imperial Milk Porter (rum barrel aged). Need to have one of those. 

Atmosphere was great. Service was great. Pretty funny waiter. Not sure of his name but he had a beard. Great guy. Don't know if I would come back but would definitely have the Imperial Milk Porter again if in the area. Did not try any food."}
{"text":"This place used to have amazing Shroomin pesto pizza. I called from next door in the hair salon to have it delivered which they've done before. I got Mike on the phone. He was kind of a dick about it. He said they were too busy. I walked out of the salon and looked next door since my business at the salon was done, they aren't that busy. Just lazy fucks. Plus, they no longer have that pizza as they apparently changed their menu a month ago. New flash to the people who run this joint, CHANGE YOUR MENU ONLINE!!! Not ever going to this place again for anything."}
{"text":"There are alot of new Breweries but FATE rules. Steve Mcfate has great beer, people and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place!' The staff is friendly and super helpful with the beer selection. We have tried several of their beers and my favorite is hatch chili. It has a hint of jalapeño and like no other beer. 

Pizza is thinner crust and not to heavy on the sauce. We also love beer cheese and pretzels as an app!
Great place to try for beer and pizza!"}
{"text":"Tried to go on Monday at 8pm and they are closed......... It says 10pm on Mondays, and 9pm on Yelp! What's going on????"}
{"text":"I LOVE Fate! 
They have the best pizzas. Who doesn't love a wood fired crust? 
My favorite appetizer is called 'Breads and Spreads'. It is always something different for the spread, last time it was jalepeno jelly and cream cheese. Then for the \"bread\" they give you pita bread and baguette bread. (It is served each time with three different spreads). So delicious. 
The food/beer is delicious. I love the atmosphere, service and the bathrooms are always clean!"}
{"text":"Ok I say this every time, but I do not like to make a habit of giving a place 5 stars in my first try, but at Fate I can't help myself. Everything from the ambiance, food, happy hour, beer, and even cake pops were simply amazing!!,

I'll start with my favorite, beer. We got here early during happy hour and thought that my wife and I would order 2 beers each. So I ordered the Smoked Porter and she had Imperial IPA. Trying these I would say the imperial IPA was really good. 8.5 100lbu. Very tasty! The smoked porter was great too. Not really my thing but with food it tasted good. A little on the over smoked flavor but I respect that. After we had the pale ale and Irish Red. The pale ale was 6.0 and it was more on par of average IPA.  The Irish Red was amazing! A strong but refreshing red. This was my wife's favorite beer. Mine has to be the imperial IPA. 

During HH we ordered the pizza bread very good. Basically cheese bread on their pizza dough. It came with a side of marinara. I would total order it again next time we are at HH

We then decided to order a pizza to share. We chose the rustic pizza which including artichoke hearts, fennel,sausage, gorgonzola cheese. I thought it was excellent pizza! Even better with a craft beer next to you. 

Anyways our experience at Fate was excellent. Id like to add that the service was excellent and liked the layout of the restaurant and the small brew tanks. This place is small but seems like a lot of room at the bar and a decent sized patio.  

Oh one more thing, when we were walking out, my wife spotted the cake pop display. We had to turn around and ordered 2! 2 bucks each and well worth it!! We tried the sinker doodle and peppermint red velvet. The red velvet was the best! A little harder shell but once you ate more they were very moist. Do your self a favor and order at least one on your way out!!"}
{"text":"Dear McFate,

I love you. I live out of state but was born and raised in Scottsdale. My brother and his family are always raving about you. I just so happened to be in town and thought, why not?! Let's see what all this hype is about. Beer: fantastic, so many options. I also love that you have other local brews available. Pretzel with beer cheese: fantastic. Con Carne pizza: favorite! I used to live in Colorado so my husband and I are big on the whole local brewery thing. Can't wait to go back on my next visit in town. So good!!! Also I bought a gift card for my brother- this isn't necessarily a bad thing but I was told they only work at the location they are bought at. It's not a problem because my brother and his family always go to this one but I thought it was odd, but the server did tell us which was nice. Love you guys. I highly recommend to anyone. 

Ps. $5 for a beer- great deal"}
{"text":"Love this place! My friends brought me here for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Oh My Gatos Golden Ale was delicious. For dinner, we ordered the McFate's salad and the The Jess and Con Carne pizzas. Everything was delicious, but my favorite was The Jess pizza. It was the perfect combination of ingredients! 

I would love to come back, sit on the patio and try some of the there beers and pizzas. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Warm and welcoming brewpub!  The beers were good, a nice selection with something for everyone.  Nitro stout was excellent, creamy and full rich taste.  We enjoyed a wood fired pizza too, yum!"}
{"text":"This is a great little hangout for a beer and some good pizza! Love the habanero infused olive oil they give you with the pizza. 
My only complaint is that occasionally I really want a \"guest beer\" and those beers are $1more. But, I understand the reason for that- so I am still giving 5 stars. Friendly, efficient staff at all times. Everyone should stop in and give this place a try. :-)"}
{"text":"A great little craft brew joint. The Pale Ales are spot on and the wife enjoyed the Extra stout. The pretzels are pretty much poetry twisted into luscious goodness with awesome beer cheese dipping sauce.

You could tell there was a strong local following and the staff seemed to know most of them. That's what you look for when passing through. When you find it, you know you found a gem."}
{"text":"In one of those ridiculous desert rainstorms, we walked/ran down the block from our hotel to Fate, where we whiled away the rest of the storm drinking tasty beer and eating pizza bread.

The presentation of the beer menu is a tease here, as they list off all the beers they brew, leaving you salivating, before you realize that only three of them are currently available.  On our visit, two were IPAs, which seemed redundant with such a small selection.  Then I realized they had a couple of other beers which were not on the menu (5 or 6 total, plus some \"guest\" beers from other breweries) and I felt less confined.  All the beers we had were very good, and not weak.  They give you stats (alcohol content, IBUs, etc) to help you pick.  I could see coming back every so often just to check out what's new on tap.

We also had pizza bread, which was basically a medium cheese pizza.  It was exactly what the mid-afternoon happy hour called for.  Speaking of happy hour, we had four beers and that pizza for $18, which is kind of a ridiculous deal.  

I love checking out local breweries when I'm visiting a city, and this place exemplifies why."}
{"text":"Beer was good not great. Service was good. Food was reallllly good. Ambience was great for an Arizona brewery especially when compared to other startups."}
{"text":"Awesome spot.
So busy on a Friday happy hour but it was perfect. Wanted to try the gate beers but the kinds were ones I do not normally like. Tried a few , good.
The brown was great. Inside is sweet and the food looked good"}
{"text":"The beer is done in small batches and makes for a great rotation. If you are a fan of craft beer, you are doing a disservice to yourself if you have not checked this place out.

The only complaint - A more robust kitchen would put this pace over the top.

The owner and staff have always been friendly and responsive.

Right now they have a double oatmeal IPA that is extremely smooth in taste. Not overpowering like most doubles. Also, I am not a huge fan of Hefes, but Fate's does not overdue the clove taste.

Great atmosphere and dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Wow!!! First timers here. 

Sunday \"brunch\" menu, which for $10, includes two 5 oz. glasses of their beer. Server was attentive, and pleasant, and also very patient. Ordered the 6\" meat & potatoes skillet, which I thought was going to be a snack, and how I was wrong. The 6\" skillet was about 2\" thick, and YUMMY! Wife ordered margarita pizza, and it was awesome on site, as well as for left overs this evening. Between the service, beer, price and food, it was definitely a 4+ star.  For the $30 bill between us (we each had an additional beer for $4/each) I thought it was awesome food, reasonable price, and great service, and very conveniently located."}
{"text":"The best in the Valley.
With the explosion of breweries, it is nice to see one that is focused on the beer they produce.  Probably one of the smallest in size and production capacity, but this brewery consistently puts out some great tap offerings.
The food complements the beer perfectly.  A nice small menu that works very well with the space."}
{"text":"Great place to spot by and try. They have a selection of beers that they brew themselves on sight and a handful of beers from different breweries. Some friends got the beer batter chicken tenders and they looked really good."}
{"text":"Well I'm happy to say this place has improved A TON since my last visit. They now have beer descriptions, two TVs and excellent service and food.

The beer was fantastic! 5 tasting flight for $8 is a good deal. Loved the Hatch Cream Ale, the Double IPA is amazing, the Milk Porter is fantastic.  Tried the Sizzurp on the first day of tapping and it's very good but a little sweet.

The Jess pizza is great. Cooked in a wood fired oven. Great balance of flavors.

The potato \"nachos\" are very good too but need hot sauce or red pepper flakes.

Place was hopping on a Friday night. I'll definitely be back. Kudos to Fate for upping their game - big time."}
{"text":"Amazing craft beer and craft pizzas. Candy bar milk stout is my jam. The hot oil is great on everything. Steve McFate and his team hit a home run with this place. Looking forward to their new and bigger location opening soon I believe."}
{"text":"The hubsters and I came here on date night recently. It was around 6:15 on a Saturday night, and surprisingly slow. I had the Cream Ale and it was yummy. The husband tried the Session and Irish Red and liked both. We split the House salad which was bomb, the pizza bread which sucked, and the fennel sausage pizza which was good. The service was lacking until I spoke up and said we wanted some help, and then the guy was super polite and attentive. Was a little pushy in trying to get us to order...dude, just give me a couple minutes to look over the menu, okay? But all in all it was good and we love little breweries like this."}
{"text":"Good gastropub, my only complaint was they were out of their IPA but great service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"friendly staff, excellent food. I had the capicola and jalapeno pizza and a pretzel appetizer. Draft selection is a little narrow which prevents 5 stars, but still very good beer regardless. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoy ourselves here.  We had several Fatality IPA beers and the meat pizza(the name evades me) the service was great.  One of the severs also recommended this habanero oil for the pizza and that was paramount to icing on a cake.  
The only reason they get 4/5 stars is because we had a conversation about better restaurants such as Ruth's Chris steakhouse and that would be a 5 in my book.   Eat here.  Drink here.  Be merry."}
{"text":"Just awesome!  I am sure I over use this word but it is fitting!  They have a huge variety of beer on tap and let me tell you the green chili brew does not disappoint!  YUMMA!  The pizzas are so good, thin crust and creative.  My husband is a meat man so he ordered the sausage which was really tasty and had a big smoke flavor.  I ordered the grape escape because it sounded weird and was the bomb!  Roasted grapes, honey balsamic, cheese...ridick!  Our friend had a salad and whatever that highly addictive basil citrus dressing was I could not get enough!  You have to try this joint!"}
{"text":"Stopped by as our first stop in Scottsdale for a friends vacation! Service was great. Waiter very sweet and accommodating. I got the burger - nothing wrong with the taste but when it comes to price in regards of the size of the patty, very disappointing. Definitely not worth what I paid. Great beer and happy hour but will not be returning for the burger!"}
{"text":"Finally writing a short review after many visits!  Recent Fennel and Sausage Flatbread very, very good.  Service fast and consistent.  Great beers especially the Hatch Cream Ale (great aroma and taste!)  Whenever owner is there he always recognizes you and thanks you for coming.  Nice."}
{"text":"Love this place!Jalapeño biznaz pizza is incredible. The beer menu is awesome. Fabulous atmosphere and an amazing place to have a quick bite to eat. Highly recommended!!!!  

End note: this place truly is the \"biznaz\""}
{"text":"The beer is pretty darn good. I tried the double IPA and the ESP. Both were very smooth and flavorful. The ambience is great, and the bartender was really friendly. Only problem was the pizza was not great - a little too greasy."}
{"text":"Went to the location for the very delicious pizza found an amazing selection of beer that they brew met Misti who is just amazing, she lights up the whole place would recommend five stars wish yelp had a thousand stars because I'd ask for a thousand more"}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic and most of the beers were pretty good.   The smoked porter was my favorite.   The menu is a bit thin and could be due to the place testing out the kitchen.  It would be nice to see more than one appetizer and pairing suggestions would be a nice addition.   A partnership with the BBQ joint next door could add a new dynamic, like braising the BBQ meats with the smoked porter.  The service staff was prompt and friendly, even with a good crowd in the house.  If you've been curious about this place, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere, and awesome beer! Definitely recommend the 'Oh My Gatos! Golden Ale.'"}
{"text":"Popped in with a few friends while visiting Scottsdale for the day and had an excellent beer bloody mary. The mix on it waa great had a nice kick to start my day off right. I tried the standard IPA and it was delicious. Very refreshing and not overly hoppy and heavy with a nice citrus hint! (Perfect for a hot day if you dont want a lighter beer) Also tried a sample of the oatmeal double IPA which is wonderful. Service and atmosphere are nice. I would come back and try the pizza we didnt eat but it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Fairly small place with a small patio. Nice decor. Not many parking spaces because of the other businesses in their parking lot.  Service was very good however the beer was thin and watery and the food was rather small portions. Overall not a bad place but not a great place."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Drinking the Porch Pilz. Great taste. Great finish. 
Lots of outdoor seating. 
Great location
Will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer, great service, a variety of tasty meals and light snacks. Can't go wrong here. Salads, pizza, burgers, sandwiches. Did I mention the exceptional service"}
{"text":"At 74th Street and Shea Boulevard in Scottsdale, a combination of brewery, pizzeria and pub, Fate's emphasis is on small-batch beer and wood-fired pies, according to founder and master brewer Steve McFate. He previously was with Colorado Boy Pub & Brewery in Ridgway, Colo., and promises Valley beer lovers a lineup of rotating traditional favorites, experimental recipes, seasonal brews and casks on tap.

Happy Hour brought me $3 Fate Belgian Saison Farmhouse Ale. Poured a golden colored body, into a rinsed tulip glass. Classic barnyard flavors of hay, earth and spices from the Belgian yeast and crisp malt. Very enjoyable.

There is a rotation of beers from light to dark. I did sample the smoked porter which had a distinctive smoke flavour imparted by using malted barley dried over an open flame. An excellent dark beer.

Fate Growlers were up on the shelves and also now have Growlettes which is 1 liter of delicious beer for only $12 New and $8 to Refill."}
{"text":"I, along with a few colleagues went to Fate based on a Google search...when we walked in, I didn't have great expectations as the place wasn't very busy.  I was the designated driver, so I didn't try any of the beers they had, but the wood fired pizza was amazing!  I got the Drunken Jess...only have one word to describe it...YUM!  also got the 'Twists of Fate'...their hot pretzels and beer cheese.
..oh my were these good!!!if in Scottsdale, you have to stop in...you will Not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We always have a good time here. Delicious food, great atmosphere, and a nice selection of beers. Although the last two times we visited. The beers we wanted to check out were gone but still listed on the menu. It happens, so we're not upset. The service was a bit slow to start but changed after our appetizers came out. Highly recommended to visit here!"}
{"text":"Great to have a brewpub so close!  Have tried this place a few times and each time, just want to turn back around and go back!!
Great beer selection with frequent rotation. They also offer some great offering from other local and nonlocal brewers. 
Staff friendly and beer smart, which is a plus. 
Food menu, although not extensive, is fantastic with their wood fired pies and clever apps. 
Not a big place so try to get there when they open or you may have to fight off other beer aficionados for a table. (We went on Fathers day. Got there when it opened and ten minutes later, they had a 20 min wait).
So I urge anyone who likes to eat and/or drink to try Fate!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Not the typical craft brewpub type of place. They have a pretty large selection of their own beers and great other beers on draft. They are kind of outside the box when it comes to style of beers. Adding a little twist to each one I think. 

It's not all about beer here though. Their food is excellent. I am not a big fan of breaded and fried food usually. McFate's is the exception for me though. The fish sandwich is amazing. The beer batter is light and just tastes so much better than most places. 

If you like great craft beer, but also like high quality food this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I went to Fate last Monday and I want to go back again! 

I had the Pablo Honey Pizza....so good...and to drink I had the Totes McOats. It was the perfect combination. 

Great spot with great pizza and beer!"}
{"text":"Great beer and above average food. I went on a jam packed day and the owner was very helpful in taking care of us. He made sure we got our beers and held a spot for us on the waiting list. After ten minutes or so, we were able to get a spot at the bar. The gf went to find him and let him know we were taken care of and he remembered her name. Again, this was during a very crazy time (Candy Stout) so it was nice. The prices were reasonable and we had The Jess for the pizza. If I lived closer, this would be my go to spot."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out! This will be a regular spot for me once I move back to the area. Great pizza, great beer....no complaints here at all. Well developed flavors in regards to the pizza toppings along with a swell crust made it awesome. Beers with tasty hop/malt blends, skillfully crafted, quenched my thirst. 
All around great place!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and it's a cool small joint. I had the cake beer the last time I was here which was delicious but this time I decided to have food. Not a large menu but the pizza struck me so I got the build your own. Just a plain pepperoni pizza. Much to my surprise it was delicious and this is not their specialty. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe next time I'll have pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Here for a second try.. No Fate IPA at all. Pretty disappointed to settle with the Dragoon, but the Pizza looks good."}
{"text":"**EDIT**

Within hours of my original review (below), I was contacted by the owner of Fate. He apologized for my experience and offered to make it right, and for that, my opinion of this company is vastly improved. It's very refreshing to know that an owner listens to their customers and seeks to improve in areas where they may fall short. You never get a second chance to make a first impression, but the response I received from the owner is certainly a large step in the right direction. 

_____________________
My girlfriend and I are HUGE beer lovers, she works at a brewery and has worked at a few different ones for the past 5+ years. We were in the Phoenix area so she could take her Cicerone exam at Crescent Crown, and we were heading up to Sedona for the next couple days. We visit breweries/brewpubs multiple times every week, and since we live in San Diego I'd like to think that we've seen a lot when it comes to the craft beer scene (I'm not trying to brag at all, just hoping to provide a context to show that we're not new to the idea/business of craft beer). We approach every new brewery with an open mind/palate, and go from there. And so it begins... 

We showed on a Saturday (3/15) early afternoon to find a half-full bar and a decent amount of people at the tables, so we grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartender (guy with dark hair, didn't get a name) told us he'd be with us in a minute (he seemed a little frazzled), so I told him there was no rush and we started looking over the menu. A couple minutes later he comes over and asks how he can help us. I asked him if they do tasting flights (since I didn't see the option on the menu), and he *literally* rolled his eyes, let out an audible chuckle/sigh, and said yes. I was immediately pretty put off, but figured I'd let it slide since they were supposed to have good beer. I asked \"Do we build our own or is it a set number for a certain price?\", to which he replied \"Well what do you want?\" with an attitude resembling a condescending teacher talking to 5 year old. 

At this point we should have left since his attitude was disgusting, but I genuinely wanted to try their beer. We ordered one flight to share and it was brought to us very quickly, which was nice. After the first taste I realized neither of us had water and we wanted a glass to cleanse the palate a little between styles. I asked the same bartender if we could each have a glass of water (a common request?), and he opens the fridge and puts down a carafe of water with two glasses, all without saying a word. I would have settled for a \"here you go\", but the silence was awkward and even more off-putting. At this point, I'm pretty much ready to pay the bill and leave; we're patronized by a worker AT A BREWERY by asking to try their beer, and we're treated rudely for having the audacity to ask for a glass of water. What's the deal with this place?

We stayed, and tried the Single Hop Sour, Hefeweizen, Table Saison, Chocolate Chili Milk Stout, and one more...can't remember (American Amber?). The beer was decent but nothing jumped out at me. I'm not a fan of hot spice/chilis in beer, but I appreciated the flavor of the chocolate against the chili in the stout. That is the only good thing I can say about this place. If I had to pick another, I'd say the parking lot was pretty clean and the pizza oven thing looked pretty cool, so thumbs up for that. 

This was the 4th brewery we stopped at in Arizona (out of 6 total), and it was the only one that literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I blame the service more than the beer, but I preferred the drinks at our other stops more anyways. 

We'll certainly be back in Phoenix (friends and cousins live there), but we will not return here and will not recommend this place to anyone back home. 

As a tip to management, I'd recommend ensuring that your staff talk to their customers like they are adults, not children. Either that, or don't hire workers that are clearly not enjoying their job; they're damaging your brand and only making your competitors look better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. After 1 visit, I just wasn't impressed (with the beer or food). They have a decent IPA, but we had to send one of our appetizers back because the potatoes were burnt. It came out a second time and was still a little too crispy. I'm waiting for something to compell me to give it another shot, but until then... ***3 Stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, and even better beer. Do yourself a favor and go here. Honestly. 
So good, I've gone two nights in a row.
Their Imperial IPA is right up there with the best (e.g Stone Ruination).  Their Imperial Coffee Milk Porter is second to none - real coffee flavor. 
Nice and small, cozy, friendly... love it!"}
{"text":"I'm a craft beer lover and I have a new favorite brewery.

We've been going here about once a week since they've opened.

Their beer is incredible!  I particularly like the slowly rotating lineup of Fate beers.  Some of my favorites so far... the Brown, Imperial IPA, Cream Ale, Irish Red, Oatmeal Stout, Belgian Saison and Pale Ale.

But man can't live on beer alone.  I think that we've tried all of their pizzas, every one delicious.  My favorites here are the... Rustica, Molto Carne, Capicola, Mediterranean and Fennel Sausage.

The staff, friendly and helpful - the atmosphere casual and comfortable.  And for desert, awesome little cake pops."}
{"text":"You must go here! Everybody is friendly. They have the best chocolate stout (forgot the name of it). And, the goat cheese pizza and salad were amazing. Better than the place that's on  Drive ins, Diners and Dives show. :)"}
{"text":"I came here a while back with some buddies and I always would get their flight of beers! The servers and bartenders are always helpful in my selection and you can NOT go wrong with their pizzas! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Beers were solid, loved the Chocolate Milk Stout! Split a margherita pizza which was ok, the chile oil is really nice though. Service was friendly. I would return if it wasn't so far from my house."}
{"text":"I guess I'm one of those people who either hate it, love it, or dont write about it...but this place was amazing!  the restaurant is small but busy. the beer is great and the fire oven pizza is heaven. I was raving about it for days and I literally cant wait for my next cheat meal to go again!"}
{"text":"Great soft opening! Service was excellent. Thank you Terry. Beer and pizza also great. Looking forward to  all the beers.  Met Steve the owner and I'm super excited about all the possibilities!"}
{"text":"We love this place - this comment is specific to tonight. We came in with the Kid, her friend, and her friend from school. Service was a bit slow and when our friend wanted to take a pizza to go - something she asked about when she ordered her dinner - she was told that there was no dough thawed and she'd need to wait another 20-minutes.

Not a huge deal, but this is the 2nd odd thing (pizza's not made right a few weeks ago) that has happened at our favorite local pizza and beer place since the new GM came in.

We will keep coming in because the beer is amazing and we like the food and the vibe. This is merely a quality check...."}
{"text":"This brewery is pretty dope. I like the IPA's but I'd stay away from those potato nachos. Good service, looks more like a restaurant. Overall a good place to chill and drink beer."}
{"text":"Fate Brewing Company caught my eye as I was driving down Shea, so I decided to stop in last night. It turns out it was their soft opening and everything seemed to run very smoothly. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The decor is modern - a bit of the industrial look with a lot of concrete and wood, but it managed to feel warm, not sterile. They have a wood fired oven and offer a variety of pizzas. I tried the margherita and it was perfect to share as an appetizer/light meal. It was a thin crust and the ingredients were very fresh. They have a wine list with regional wines and brew about 5 of their own beers. Most of their beers were described as hoppy, which I'm not a huge fan of, but the cream ale I got was pretty good (a little bitter for me, but I think beer connoisseurs would appreciate it). They also feature other regional brews. Overall, I think this will be a great little classy hangout spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  People are friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming.  The reason for 5 stars for me is the pizza!  Literally the best pizza I've ever had.  Get the \"Jess\" pizza.  Add jalapeños.  BOMB!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite micro brew! Have Been going since they opened, and I absolutely love Fate."}
{"text":"Fate Brewing Company brews small batch beers brewed on location. They have a rotating list of 10 Fate beers and space for two guest beers on tap. When I payed a visit, I ordered a beer flight and tasted five of their top beers that day. My favorite was the Coffee Milk Porter with coffee from Cartel Coffee Lab in the recipe! I took a growler home for the boyfriend to try! 

Travis gave me a tour of the brewery and introduced me to the brewer Adam! He's in charge of beer flavor creativity and I must say he does a good job! He started out in culinary school and found himself interested in brewing. The brewery also has a kitchen that specializes in wood-fired pizza. Yum!

I can't wait to go back and see what beers they have on tap next!"}
{"text":"Pizza is outstanding! Best pizza for a bar I've ever had in my entire life! The beer is just as good, they have a chili beer that refreshing, spicy and absolutely delightful!"}
{"text":"Fate is... well, it's okay.

Came here with some friends on a Saturday night a few weeks back. It was about 7PM and the restaurant was pretty packed. It took a few minutes for a host to come up to us and let us know it'd be a few minutes. We sat outside and it truly was less than a 10 minute wait before a table opened up. Awesome! I had worked all day and was excited (and ready) to order some appetizers.

Unfortunately, it'd be quite a while before that happened. It took at least ten minutes (probably closer to twenty) for a server to make their way to our table. When he did finally get to us, he was friendly enough. We ordered two beer flights and two sodas, the soft pretzels with beer cheese fondue, and the Irish nachos. The beer flights came out decently quickly, along with the sodas. The beers were just all right. The pale ale was pretty good - nice, light, and smooth. The beet beer divided our table, with two of us liking it and the other two (myself included) really disliking it. I chalk that up to not quality level, but more just specific taste preferences. The other beers were pretty forgettable. Not bad, but not overwhelmingly delicious either.

I had been craving a soft pretzel for weeks and Fate's did not disappoint. The pretzels were piping hot and had a great \"crust,\" with a super soft inside. The beer cheese fondue was AWESOME. Nice and hot, just the right amount of beer / cheese. I not only used it for the pretzels, but also for the Irish nachos, which were delicious but lacking a bit. With the beer cheese fondue they were pretty delicious, though! 

When our appetizers came, we ordered our pizzas. It felt like there was quite a lag between when we ordered our dinners and when they ended up coming, and at this point the house had emptied out significantly. My husband and I got the veggie pizza. It was pretty good (nothing overly spectacular). He didn't like the crust (which was buttery and salty, maybe a little too thin), but I did. Our friends got the Popper pizza and liked it, but we all agreed it wasn't anything to write home about.

Overall, I was definitely expecting more. I definitely came in with a mindset of comparing it to Four Peaks Brewing, and it unfortunately did not live up to that standard - in food, beer, or service. I will probably try the new location out and give it another shot - hopefully we'll be surprised and love it next time around!"}
{"text":"Yay beer! Some neat stuff, too. Beet juice saison? Well, okay, then. The Irish red is solid. One of their guest ciders wasn't as described, but it wasn't bad. The stout was hearty and intense. 

Their beer size options are flexible - flights are affordable, half-pints are an option, and you can taste before you decide. Our service was good. The venue itself is a bit blah, but that's forgiveable with the beer and the people.

We liked most of the food. Solid salad, satisfying comfort Irish Nachos, friends liked their pizza. The \"Toasted Mozz\" were just boring. The bread was nicely crispy and the cheese was bubbled, but it was bread and cheese with a grape tomato. Also, that jarred oily mess of pesto was gross."}
{"text":"As I was finishing up my yelp reviews from a recent trip to Firestone Walker in Paso Robles, I was shocked to see i had not written about my new favorite brewery in AZ.

\"FINALLY!  A BREWERY IN NORTH SCOTTSDALE...\" is basically my reaction to Fate Brewery.  One \"fateful\" night (pun intended) when I decided to stop in to try their Imperial IPA, a love affair began that I don't anticipate ending anytime soon.

I will admit, at first, I was skeptcal.  There are so many places that have come and gone...there will always be the places that \"have decent craft beer, for the area.\"  That was my initial hesitation upon opening, and is probably why it took me months to finally give them a try.  I was pleasantly surprised when the beer was one of the best I've had in the valley.

Although the location seems small, it's more than adequate.  Their patio is awesome in the cooler months.  They have enough tables where you never feel like you have to wait long, but never feel like it's too empty.  Personally I favor sitting at the bar, no matter where I go.  Their bar is really cool, and the chairs are spaced appropriately so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the person next to you.

On to the important stuff, the beer.  I've noticed over the past few months, they have done a really good job of satisfying all palattes. Whether you're a hop head, or more of a fruit beer, or maybe something darker, there has been at least one of each on their menu.  I am a hop head through and through, and their American Pale Ale and recently released IPA are my favorite in Arizona right now.  They also often release specialty beers that have never disappointed (for instance, a coffee IPA).

I have only had pizza there, and it was great.  Love the hot chili oil.

The atmosphere to me is the closest you'll get to a \"cheers\" type of bar.  Maybe being from the east coast I'm more acclimated to this type of vibe, but it's small, quaint, welcoming, and inviting.  I have gone in with my husband, with my girlfriends, or sat by myself, and I've always felt comfortable, and have always met really cool people along the way. 

For me what sets this bar apart is the service.  Steve has done a really great job of assembling an awesome team, who remembers who you are, and what you like to drink.  And Steve is such a nice person.  It's fun chatting him up about his beer.

Their social media and website are always up to date, so check regularly to see if there's anything special on.

I think what you do need to realize before going in is, it's a small brewery with a decent size list of oustanding beers.  This isn't a Yardhouse type of establishment.  And you don't have to be a beer expert or beer snob to enjoy it.  From what I've experienced, if you ever have any questions, or want to try anything, all you have to do is ask."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for pizza and beer. I had the Jesse pizza and it was so delicious! I love the spicy oil that they serve with the pizza. Such a great local brewery!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! We were able to stop in while making a trip to CVS to have a couple of beers, they definitely have an interesting collection of rotating ones. 
I liked the sour beer and the IPA the most, the only one I thought was questionable was the beets flavored beer. 
Then again, I'm not a fan of beets and I was not the one to order it, so I can't really say much, other than how popular it was shocked me a bit. 

I really want to try the Jess pizza, which sounds amazing and com back for a few more beers. The pricing was a little high for my taste, but then again I would go to local breweries and spend 4-5 dollars on a pint. 

It's not going to keep me from coming back though. Just maybe more-so after a payday. Lol"}
{"text":"We stopped by Fate Brewing for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner and weren't surprised to find it quite busy.  We put our names on the list to wait for a table.  While we waited, we enjoyed a beer on the patio.  Unfortunately, there was little space between the outdoor seating and the high top counter surrounding the patio.  We had enough room to stand and drink our beers but felt that we were intruding on other patrons dining experience.  I'd love to see a little reorganization on the patio to make the counter area more usable, perhaps even some bar stools.  

We were seated, brought menus and a cute little jug of water for the table.  We looked over the menu and decided on the house salad, Rustica pizza and a Capicola pizza.  We also enjoyed a flight of the four Fate brews available.  

All in all the food was great.  The salad was fresh, the pizzas were unique, delicious and cooked to perfection.  We thoroughly enjoyed the beers.  I loved the Pale Ale and my husband would have sipped on Smoked Porter all night long.

Next to the host stand, there is a cooler housing some of the best cake pops I have ever eaten.  They were more like cookie dough pops than cake pops, if you ask me, but they were amazing!  Snickerdoodle was killer!

There were a few issues with the attentiveness of the servers when it was busy, and our servers menu knowledge was iffy.  Serious five star potential, for the next visit, but until they work out a few minor kinks, I'm sticking with a solid four star rating."}
{"text":"Beers were great. $1 half pint special is great for sampling.  Pizza was above average, but it's always tough to judge a small pizza. Location is not great, but the actual restaurant/atmosphere was an A."}
{"text":"Uber local microbrew hotspot. If you like beer, you'll love it here. Not only do they brew their own concoctions of hoppy goodness, they even support their fellow brewers and include an array of Arizona beers on tap.

The menu is limited, as the kitchen is based on nothing but a wood-burning oven. But trust me, anything you get, is made with TLC and will leave you incredibly satisfied. The pizza -- I love the Jess with chicken instead of bacon -- is perfectly delectable. DO IT!"}
{"text":"I really love their beer.  Pizza is great, too.  Probably one of the best breweries in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group after the hiking UYE (which was awesome, BTW). We were seated on the patio and our server (who was attentive and very good overall) moved heaters all around us so we were comfortable. So why 3 stars? The food we got just wasn't very good....maybe we ordered the wrong thing.... but it was pretty bad. I tried another person's pizza bread and that was bland, dry, and not very cheesy...not awesome. The husband and I shared the The Jess (garlic, spinach, ricotta, bacon, garlic olive oil)....sounds great, right? Well... it wasn't. It wasn't very garlicky and the bacon had an odd flavor. It was, again, dry and kind of bland. I got a side of marinara sauce which helped a lot, but it still wasn't awesome. For beers we had the strawberry rhubarb....funky, but not bad...and the cream ale....not bad, but nothing special. I will say that other people's food looked better than mine, so it is possible that I just ordered the wrong thing, but regardless, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed some happy hour appetizers and beers. I ordered the house brewed Irish red and loved it! My boyfriend opted for one of their guest beets. We appreciate the great selection. We also ordered one of the wood fired pizzas which was great! Thank you to our server AJ for being so prompt friendly and helpful! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch recently and had a great time as usual. The staff is friendly and helpful but also speedy so you can really get in and out for a lunch stop. Loved the specials that they have now- half salad and half pizza for 10 bucks is great. Thanks again Fate!"}
{"text":"Really cute little place in a strip mall in Scottsdale.

We went in around lunch time on a Sunday.  They offer brunch and it looked like the brunch crowd was just leaving.  There was no hostess - just a sign saying to seat yourself next to a pile of menus.

We sat at the bar rather than a table.  The bartender was super friend and he approached us immediately and also gave us a menu that showed their brunch specials.  I am a big fan of bloody marys, but I am VERY pick (to say the least) about the mix used.  He mentioned that he makes it himself and let me try some. It was really good and spicy, just how I like it (I later saw him making it with sriracha).  I decided to have the bloody beer ($5) and my friend had the beermosa ($5).  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the bloody beer and could barely drink half of it.

Also, they only had a few of their beers on tap.  The bartender mentioned that their brewer has been out of town and would be back soon.  I only tried one of the beers (other than that in my bloody beer) and I wasn't impressed.  I would have to try a lot more to make a real opinion about their brewing operations.  They do offer other beers on tap as well.

They offer pizza and have a cool little kitchen area with a brick oven.  We wanted something sweet and were told that they could make something called a \"sweetie pie,\" which was pizza crust brushed with cinnamon and brown sugar, topped with a raspberry compote and topped with a vanilla mascarpone cream.  It was really good!

This place was actually really far out of the way for us, so I am not sure I'll be back.  But if I am in the area, I will stop in and check what they have on tap."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were exceptionally good. The 1st time I was here I ordered the flight, which was six of their beers in sample glasses. I always do this for a new brewery visit. I have to say their beers were pretty good and no complaints were given. I always go for an IPA or APA. The \"Rye so serious\" and \"Toats McOats\" were my favorite. I'd come back for these and that is what I did the second time around. 

When my girlfriend and I went back with some friends and coworkers we ordered two of their pizzas. The first one we ordered was the Truff Diver and as a second option we let them make us a \"surprise pizza\". 

The service was alright. It is more of a laid back type of service and very nonchalant. Everything came out pretty quickly though. Overall a great place for an after work beer and grub. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This is exactly what the Scottsdale & Shea area needed!! (remember when that intersection had lots of boozing options?) 

Get a beer sampler-- you MUST try them all!  De-lish

I appreciate that a brewery finally put some thought into offering wine too!  I love that idea since several of my lady-friends don't drink beer.  (getting the boys to a brewery is never a challenge) 

The wood fired pizza is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"I don't drink so I can't comment on the beer, but the pizza here is the best in the Scottsdale. I tried the honey habanero and it changed my life! lol Also, their pretzels are amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent addition to the neighborhood. Great selections of rotating beers, my favorite is the IPA, plus good pizza pizza."}
{"text":"I came here and had a few beers. Fantastic! My favorite was the belgian saison. Glad to have a place like this down the street from me. But I wished the menu offered more, because I have some allergies, I can't actually try any of the food here. If there were a few more options, this might just become our main stay."}
{"text":"Top notch beer. Excellent food. Friendly staff. Good prices. What else could you ask for?  Fate Brewing is awesome!"}
{"text":"The beer was good and the pizza was decent.I had a couple of brews and tried two different pizzas. Everything was fine and dandy."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, beer was good although I wish they had some good lagers on the menu.  Rustica pizza was really good.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Fate tonight. Living in the Gilbert area I dont make it out this way very often. That will definitly change. The oatmeal IPA had a really balanced hop profile, for 9% abv drank very smooth not boozy at all. Seems to be a local neighboorhod spot, pretty busy for a thursday night. Will add this to my\"destinatiin\" brewery list."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! The beer is absolutely fantastic. I have not had anything here I didn't like. They had an Oatmeal double IPA and it was one of, and this is not an exaggeration, the best IPA's I have had. Up there with the Dogfish 90 minute. The Pizzas are fantastic and the happy hour is incredible. I hope they are around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"*Update/Edit:  Frustrated that they are closed during the daytime.  It's a catch-22 because our group would like to go here but they're not open, so we go support other places.  But then most of the time now we're set on going to our other places, so we don't make the special effort to go to Fate at all when they happen to be open.  Decisions to close like this probably impact a lot of customers because the way you find out is usually by the frustrating experience of showing up for a pint thirsty, hungry, etc. and seeing the sign.  On top of that, some of us sort of forgave them but then honestly forgot about the restricted hours and so we showed up at lunch and got the closed sign again.  We can't be alone in having this happen.*

Flavorful ales can be found here in Scottsdale on Shea, just a bit east of Scottsdale road on the south side of the road.  Cream Ale, Pale Ale, Smoked Porter, Brown Ale - I tried them all and appreciated the pronounced hop influence, especially in the pale ale.

Stunning bar and brewery atmosphere with a modern, high-end feel to it all.  Indoor and outdoor patio seating available.  They might be a victim of their own success though because I can see it filling up quite fast during prime hours.

Wood fired pizzas made in your sight at the back and mine was very good.  Perfect size for a really hungry person or two people to share if they're going to have salads first.  Salads looked tasty but didn't try.  

Staff was incredibly polite and professional, which is something sorely missing in the service industry these days.  They were quick to answer questions about the beers and offered some helpful literature on their house brews.  

Guest taps are available if your tastes lean somewhere else.  Mongo IPA, Scrimshaw Pils, Bruery Mischief, among others were noted.  

Limited parking in the front facing Shea, but more parking is available in the back.  Looks like dinner hours only (for now)."}
{"text":"Candy Bar Milk Stout....Review Over! The stuff of flavored beer dreams. Seasonal. 

But, seriously, we enjoy McFates just as much as we enjoyed it before the name change saga. Their beer is good, and the food is excellent. Wood fired pizzas, roasted nuts and olives, spinach queso, There are two locations and this particular has a limited menu due to the size of the kitchen. The pizza is a staple when we visit this one if we are eating. Love the Pablo Honey (capicola ham, habanero honey, garlic oil) and the hot sausage (fennel sausage, red pepper harissa, goat cheese). At the other location, we favor the Maui chicken salad (orange, pineapple, strawberries, pecans, feta), roasted garlic burger (swiss cheese mushroom burger), and street tacos (pork delish). The only thing we weren't thrilled with was their fish and chips.

The Irish Red, Coffee Milk Stout, Pueblo Vienna Lager and some of the staples we can't live without. There are always great seasonal choices and they have had some good saisons and sours. As usual, I can't speak to the high IBU hoppy stuff, but friends say the IPA is one of the best they can find anywhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to check it out since we were in the neighborhood. Loved everything (beers, food, atmosphere, service) and can't wait to come back with friends. 

My husband and I generally prefer pale ales so we ordered the Single Pale Ale and American Pale Ale. Both were awesome! We had sampled some pale ales at Arizona Wilderness the night before and I preferred the beers at Fate. I would even say that Fate  could easily become my favorite local brew. Looking forward to coming back for the Double Oatmeal IPA.

Food was impressive as well and prices were very reasonable. Menu consists of pizzas, salads, and apps. It was hard to choose a pizza because they all sounded great, some interesting ingredient combos too. Our server recommended the fennel sausage and it didn't disappoint. The sausage had great flavor and loved the pairing with goat cheese!!"}
{"text":"This place actually looked pretty nice inside for a brewery but I was sitting out on the patio with a group of my fellow Yelpers. Even though we were a large party, the service was great. Fate has a pretty limited food menu... just pizza and a couple salad and appetizer options. Most of us seemed to enjoy our pizza. The hubby and I ordered the pesto one and it was pretty tasty. Not the best pizza I've ever had but good. Anyway, it's a brewery so one does not come here for the food. Since I had never been here before I went ahead and did a full flight (4oz pours of all 6 beers) and here are my thoughts on their brews:

Strawberry Rhubarb - This was described as a Berliner Weisse which is a beer style I am not at all familiar with but based on the name I thought it would be sweet. To my surprise, it was actually pretty sour (I now know that is how it is supposed to be). But it really did taste just like strawberry rhubarb pie but just not sweetened... you know that fruity but tart flavor? They completely captured it. Yummy! I liked this one more than I expected to.

Cream Ale - This was my least favorite beer at Fate. It did not have enough flavor or body. I was expecting more maltiness (is that a word?)  I guess if you are a lager drinker (which I am not) you would enjoy it. Probably would taste better in the summer on a hot day.

Irish Red - Almost everyone at the table (myself included) agreed this is their best beer. On the menu it said this had won an award at the Great American Beer Festival in CO and I can see why. Flavor was perfectly balanced. Tasty hops but not too bitter. Just a fantastic beer.

American Pale Ale - I have never been a fan of IPAs but I have recently developed a taste for American or \"West Coast\" pale ales. Just hoppy enough to wake up your palate but not too much that it is intensely bitter. This one had a nice malty flavor to it as well. I guess for a true hop head it might not be enough hops but I really enjoyed it very much.

Double Oatmeal IPA - This one was very interesting. I have never experienced (or even heard of) an oatmeal IPA before. I love oatmeal stouts because they have that nice, creamy mouthfeel to them (yeah, that's right, I said mouthfeel). This one had that same texture but was really hoppy like you would expect from an IPA. I couldn't quite decide if I liked it or not. Next time I'll have to get a whole pint so I can figure it out. They don't have the ABV values on their website but if I remember from the menu this one was pretty strong.

Oatmeal Stout - This style is just always a tasty beer in my book and this one was no exception. I would drink beer this any day of the week. It had a beautiful rich, dark color to it. Also a great flavor and just the perfect touch of sweetness."}
