{"text":"Happy to find this place! The chestnuts are really good. Smaller than usual, but they are sweet and there are no bad (rotten) ones. Small ones are actually better value anyways (they sell by scooping with different size scoops- but make sure it is beyond a certain weight for each size). Roasted so it has a nice toasty fragrance. Love getting a warm bag of chestnuts to snack on!!"}
{"text":"Best chestnuts ~walk inside and smells so good !!   $7.00 for 1 Large cup of chestnuts that come super duper hot that has steam coming out of the bag!"}
{"text":"Fresh hot chestnuts are so good and sweet. Best eaten when they are still warm and easy to peel.   Very friendly service even though I do not speak Chinese. Will definitely be back."}

{"text":"I was heading to First Markham, but went a new way following Google Maps and accidentally found this place. The chestnut is so sweet and delicious, easy to peel off too. I bought $14 first, then went back and spent $56 the next day. I'll definitely come back for more fresh chestnut!"}
{"text":"Best chestnuts in TO. The store is located right behind first markham place in a separate plaza while the mobile \"food truck/van\" is parked at splendid china tower (across from pacific mall along steeles on the south side). I think it's a husband and wife duo operating (husband works the store while wife works the van) but I'm not sure. Both are very nice individuals. They have the proper roasting machines and sell by sizes (S/M/L). I always get large. These babies are best eaten fresh but also taste pretty good once they've cooled down. They used the Vicinity rewards system but discontinued their partnership so now its a rewards system where the owner takes your phone number in his laptop.  If you like roasted chestnuts, this is THE place to check out!"}

{"text":"Their chestnut tastes amazing when it's hot. It peels easily and stays hot for some time. It's a great snack when you are in the area."}
