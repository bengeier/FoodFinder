{"text":"WOW!!! Want to get screwed? Go to Senti in Lawrenceville. Yup, food was ok, but do you really want to pay $28.00 for a 5 oz. glass of wine? Really, a mixed drink for $12, and without any warning, the bill comes to the table. $28.00 for a 5 oz. glass of wine. A bottle that we can buy at the PA state store.
Guys, there are tons of great Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. You don't have to go to Senti."}
{"text":"We really loved our meal at Senti.  Our waitress Kody was awesome.  The salmon was fabulous!  The food presentation was beautiful!.  Franco was very accommodating.  He really takes pride in his establishment!  I loved the vibe.  The decor was contemporary but very comfortable.  I highly recommend.  What a great night."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Senti!  The homemade focaccia bread was out of this world as well as everything else I tasted. My favorite dish was the gnocchi with their house made burrata cheese. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited there with a few girlfriends and all of us enjoyed it very much. The food was all delicious and no one even left enough to take home a doggie bag. Our waitress (Marissa? Can't remember her name) was great. Attentive but not intrusive. The restaurant is very nice. Sleek and modern. Definitely worth another visit soon."}
{"text":"Second time around... 

So I love the decor. So nice, clean and modern. The owner was walking around and helping out and was really nice and professional. Kudos to him. 

The server was young and nice but didn't explain the specials well. Every time he came over it was just awkward. 

Pricing is weird. Salads are almost the same price as the pasta. And the meals are double the pasta. 

Lasagna was way way overlooked and mushie. But had a nice b√©chamel.  

Skipped deserts for the night."}
{"text":"Dinner was fine, but as another reviewer wrote, a forgettable meal. I don't see any reason to have a return visit. We ordered all the specials: beef carpaccio and goat cheese tart for apps, and the lamb and scallops for mains. The beef carpaccio was on the tasteless side and the goat cheese tart was unremarkable. The lamb and the scallops were cooked perfectly, but again the dish was just fine, nothing memorable about it. The descriptions for all of the dishes sounded much more impressive than the actual meal.

The one thing I did like quite a lot was the dessert. We got the tiramisu and the nutella mousse. Both were delicious! So if you go, definitely leave room for dessert. 

We ate inside, but the outdoor patio looks quite nice. And they seem to have a happy hour deal during the week that a drink comes with a free antipasta.  The space is large, and actually felt very un-pittsburgh to me, but I couldn't place why."}
{"text":"We have had dinner here twice now. Both times we felt the food and the service were top notch. In addition, the atmosphere is upscale without feeling stuffy.  The restaurant is a \"cool\" kind of place and it felt very New \"Yorky\" to be here.  It is open and airy and the small bar is even a great place to pull your chair up and have some great wine and a bite. All in all, we feel this place is well worth it to eat here and enjoy the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great wine, food was forgettable. Chicken was a little undercooked, soup was very bland."}
{"text":"Senti has a really cool modern Italian atmosphere. They have a great selection of wine (although most of it is on the pricier side) and a pretty good variety of meals. I had the fried eggplant dish and it was delicious and my friends really enjoyed the lasagna. My other friends tried the gnocchi and were not happy with it though. I also really enjoyed the mixed salad... Balsamic vinaigrette dressing was delicious. Not giving it a full 5 stars because of how nasty the gnocchis were (and I mean it's an Italian restaurant so there really isn't any excuse). 

Would definitely recommend, but just be careful when choosing your entree since there seems to be some inconsistency."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Senti but it was such a let down! 

We got there on a Friday night and there were only three other tables.  Four different servers kept filling up our waters but no one came over to take our drink order for a good 15 minutes.  It was bizarre.

We started with the fritto misto and it was so bad.  It was tiny baby shrimp, calamari rings, and the most pathetic display of vegetables I have ever seen.  It was SO SKIMPY for what it was and wasn't even good.  Then we each had the mixed salad that lacked so much flavor... it was just lettuce no dressing.  I am not a fan of over drenched  salads but this literally had NO dressing.

My husband then got the lasagna... it was a tiny portion and said it was nothing special.  I got the bronzino and the fish was good but the gnocchi it came with was just awful.

I am pregnant so didn't have anything to drink and with this amount of food and my husband having two glasses of wine... the bill came to $150.  Which wouldn't be bad if it had been a good meal but it was terrible.  What a waste of money."}
{"text":"One of the BEST dining experience in Pittsburgh!!! They were courteous, accommodating and the provides the perfect fine dining experience. After a very disappointing reception at Tender, we called Senti in desperation inquiring if they were able to accommodate a large party on short notice. They welcomed us with warm and exemplary service. We were treated like queens and their food was to die for...From the perfectly cooked duck to scrumptious squid ink pasta to the delicious vanilla pudding and donut holes.  The sommeliar was knowledgeable and a perfect fine dining professional.  He recommended the perfect wine for our palettes and did not once allowed us to pour our own wine (as should be!). I'm so impressed with this place that i will shout to the moon and back how great a restaurant Senti is!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night solo at the bar. Interier kind of feels like a swanky hotel rather than a restaurant. 
I didnt order an appitizer or drink since I was dining alone. For my entree I got the salmon entree and let me tell you, I  judge a restaurant by how well their cooked salmon entree is and Senti knocked it out of the park. It was served with sun dried tomato risotto and mixed veggies. It was amazing. Bravo! Then I treated myself to a piece of tiramisu. It was obviously homemade in house and delicious. 
I enjoyed my dinner completely and will be returning to see what else the menu has in store! Great job Senti."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Senti was excellent. Both our dishes were well prepared, service was attentive but not intrusive. Atmosphere is sophisticated but price is reasonable for the quality. This is a very good modern Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"We found Senti through the Burgh Bits and Bites food tour. It was our second stop on the tour and my friends and I were so impressed, we made reservations for dinner on our way out the door from the tasting. 

During the tour, we sampled a small tasting of their gnocchi. Though it was the smallest of all the tastings we had during the tour, it was one of the best. Handmade gnocchi really stands out. I've had it many places and this was one of the best I have tasted. During the tour, the owner also came out to talk to us and tell us about the restaurant and the food. (He explained the secret behind good gnocchi, too!). I found this to be a very nice touch. He noted their automated wine dispenser, which we were all impressed by and wanted to give a try.

Our dinner was lovely. The owner remembered us from the tour and took very good care of us. I tried their lemon burrata ravioli which was incredibly delicious. I also had the salmon which was not only a generous portion but also one the best salmon dishes I have tasted at a restaurant in a long time. We did try the automated wine dispenser and found it to be an added bit of fun to our night there.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for authentic Italian food, handmade pasta, and/or good wine."}
{"text":"Fantastic apps, wine and dinner. Impeccable service, beautiful venue!!"}
{"text":"Even if the food wasn't good..but it is...even if the atmosphere was bland. but.it is not..even if all the staff weren't just simply a joy to deal with...but they are..this place would deserve attention because it's an asset to a community that's striving to make itself better..and that's a plus for Pittsburgh...btw don't forget the free parking in a secure lot across the street,,,you can dine AND watch your vehicle..Lawrenceville I see has now instituted pay parking on the street so dine at SENTI and save!...now as an aside..my Martini was a bit small, and they definitely don't over pour the wine..two fingers more for the price would have been perfect..and perhaps an Amuse Bouche would be a nice touch...but hey this is a classy place with classy people and if that vibe is in your Wheelhouse..you're going to love SENTI.

{"text":"We had excellent service and the food was really great!  The bread was awesome.  Who doesn't love complimentary bread?  It's made in shop and you can order some for take home as well.  Ordered the veggie lasagna and the salmon.  Both excellent.  The tiramisu is literally best I've ever eaten.  Apple tart was the only thing that was blah.  Otherwise we will be back."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have enjoyed it. But last night? Not so much. Our reservation was for 5:30. One member of our party arrived at 5:10 and was told she couldn't be seated until the entire party arrived. Really? You couldn't seat one person out of a party of three until everyone was there? Senti is not the only restaurant that does this and it's very customer unfriendly. But it gets better. We arrive, order a drink at the bar (that's where she waited) and told the host we were all present and would like to go to our table. He takes us to our table, which is only set for two people. Seeing this, he takes us back to the waiting area until they set another place. Shouldn't this have been taken care of while you made the first arrival wait? And why didn't you seat us at one of the other tables that were already set? There were only three other parties in the restaurant at the time, so there were plenty of other tables available. As for the food, it was fine. My grilled radicchio wasn't plated very well, but it was quite good. My duck however was not that good. Quite gamey. Our server was warm and efficient. She also knew the wine list and was able to knowledgeably discuss the wines. So, overall it was a reasonable meal, though we've had better there. But the beginning was not acceptable."}
{"text":"Our dinner was amazing. Every course was beautifully plated, a true work of art. And the flavors were well-balanced. Most plates were noteworthy. Kudos to the kitchen!  The service, though good, wasn't up to par with kitchen. It wasn't fluid, well timed or attentive. It took a while for water, for bread, and for dessert menus. Even with a reservation, the table wasn't ready when we arrived. This isn't generally too disappointing but the team wasn't helpful in moving from the bar to the restaurant when the table was ready. Yes, we'll go back but likely a slower midweek evening instead of weekend."}
{"text":"Great service & great food!

First I want to comment about the service, from hostess to servers were very professionally, well trained staff.  The hostess made us feel welcome even though we did not have a reservation and arranged a table for us in a nice location.  Justin our server and Zach who filled waters and boxed leftovers for us were also very nice and attentive.

We had the pureed vegetable soup with Italian ham (can't spell it) was light and refreshing without being over-salted as is the case with some establishments.  My son had the scallop app and I had the stuffed squash flowers both tasty and well prepared.

We also ordered lasagna and 1/2 chicken which we also liked very much.  Want to try the bronzino next time and also the tiramisu that everyone raves so much about.

This restaurant is an excellent place for family, friends, or a romantic date night.

Looking forward to another delicious meal soon."}
{"text":"We will be back! Lawrenceville needed a place like this. From appetizer to entree....bravo!
Delicious wines and cocktails.  Bright, hip, urban atmosphere sets it apart from other restaurants in The area."}
{"text":"A dinner date location for this past Saturday, my girlfriend and I checked out Senti on Butler Street. An okay overall experience but things just seemed to be lacking experience-wise. 

Location: 
Positioned on the main artery in Lawrenceville, Butler Street sees a fair amount of traffic but Senti does have some parking spots directly across the street in a small lot. Signage could be larger and clearer here as one could mistake this lot for a restricted area. 

Atmosphere: 
Upon entering, you will pass through grocery store style automatic stores which my date and I found odd. They are horizontal sliding doors but have the \"caution\" signage on the center and just set the wrong vibe upon entering. A normal glass door would've sufficed. 

Entering the restaurant itself there is a fairly large bar in front and to the right with modern d√©cor. For some reason it just reminded me too much of an airport bar. 

The restaurant was just too small in my opinion which didn't allow you to really become enveloped in the experience, it felt like we were eating in a medium sized meeting room. Note there is seating outside. The modern d√©cor theme continued throughout which was nice, but I noticed a button missing from the white leather bench and Command Brand-style hooks hanging from the ceiling seemingly for added d√©cor or events. Something just struck me as off for a date-night ambiance dinner.

Service:
The service didn't miss however. Our hostess, runner and waitress were all very professional and well timed.

Food:
Pork Belly: Slightly dry for being a fattier selection of protein. I would have liked to see more rendered fat and moisture. Paired fig was too soft/overcooked

Duck: I have enjoyed better duck as the fat cap here also could've been rendered a touch more which left some chewy segments. Dish also seemed somewhat cool when served. Fried kale was pleasant although could've served less on the plate.

Blueberry Torta: Predictable unfortunately, the crust was a bit too dry for my liking. My date's off-menu buttercake was more satisfying. 

Drink:
Tequila, aperol, grapefruit, sage: Packed the right punch and was nicely balanced"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Food was average at best   Service was sub standard. 
Salads never came. When we told waitress we didn't get salads she was indifferent and unapologetic. The linguine and clams was served with FIVE unopened clams (tiny) and it took a long time for the replacement (glad I didn't let her take my entire plate) again no apology. Best meal was special short ribs. Also very loud. Difficult to hear server."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING in every way! We are from Cincinnati & dine out at this level quite often, so I believe an experienced \"FOODIE\". Thus, a 5 Star Rating... I was surprised at the scope of the menu... many offerings in each category.... Appetizers, 1st, 2nd,& 3rd courses.. Something delicious for everyone.....Sofia's was our server (delightful). We even chatted with Franco the charming owner who stopped by to sat hello. GO. ENJOY! FoodieQ"}
{"text":"Well the girls and I decided to go to Senti to have a little \"Dames who Dine\" situation going on. 
First: They checked out coats (in the dead of winter) which was nice, the owner took us to our seats and pulled the chairs out for us. Our waitress comes over and says \"oh my god! I love your glasses\". So we were off to a pretty great start. 

We asked what her favorite cocktail was and she said \"Towering Inferno\" (i think that was the name). So two of us got that, the other two ordered elderflower/rosemary/prosecco drink. 
She brought us a nice sized plate of bread and butter which we wolfed down in a hurry. We discussed and decided to start off with a cheese plate (if there is one thing I love it's a good cheese plate) and a meat plate that came with some pickled veggies. So we put that order in. Perused the menu a bit more and threw in our entree orders. We also decided on splitting a bottle of wine (we opted for the $40 bottle instead of the $115). 
Our cheese and meat plates came. No one let us know what the cheese were, but that was alright. The meat plate wasn't described too well on the menu so we were left guessing as to what things were. (Meat #1: Fancy bologna, #2: proscuitto, #3 what looked and tasted like capicola, #4 shaved beef jerky, there were some quick pickled carrot squars and some pickled onion and cauliflower (i think).) The cheese was a blue cheese, a brie, and a harder white cheese served with strawberries, some raisin/fig jam thing, grapes, and a two triangles of toasted bread. I'm not going to lie. I was really disappointed in the cheese plate (which the listed price was just market price) and the meat plate (though plentiful) was a bit disappointing too (especially for $30!). The waitress brought us some more bread, what I can i say i love a good bread and butter situation. Those that ordered side salads (Rucola: Arugula, Fennel, Dried Cranberries, Shaved Parmiggiano, and Lime & Fennel Dressing) received them and the salad was alright, it needed a PINCH more dressing and maybe some extra lime to cut the oil. It was decent though. 
Our table ordered the following: 
Filet - Served with a Horseradish Sauce, Roasted Potatoes, Fried Brussels Sprouts, and String Beans
Gnocchi (with red sauce)
Salmon - Honey Mustard Glazed Grilled Salmon with Haricots Verts & Buttered Red Potatoes
Pappardelle with Wild Boar Rag√π
Broccolini Saut√©ed with Garlic

Filet (which is what I ate) - I ordered it medium rare. It came and about 1/2 of it was medium well and 1/2 was medium rare. I was a little disappointed but the crust and seasoning on the filet was spot on so it made up for it. My companions at dinner said \"did you get that medium rare? It looks over cooked four you.\" I was okay with it. The potatoes were lacking a bit in seasoning but very crispy and delicious. The fried brussel sprouts were great (to be fair though I LOVE brussel sprouts), my dinner dates all had to try them too. The beans needed a pinch of salt and maybe a little cracked pepper but over all they were decent as well. I did not like the sauce that they THANKFULLY put on the side. It was too... something. I couldn't quite place it, but it was on the side so i didn't have to eat it. 
Gnocchi - My sister LOVES gnocchi, specifically Casbah's gnocchi. She said well this is an italian joint, I should get pasta. it came and it looked pretty standard. Her review is as follows: It was alright, it was your typical gnocchi, the shape of the pasta was more little tubular things than typical gnocchi. The sauce wasn't very good. It needed some more seasoning or something. It was just really bland and I was a bit disappointed. 
Salmon - My friend got the salmon, she didn't say too much about it. She said it was good. She cleaned her plate and seemed pretty jazzed about it. 
Pappardelle - My other friend didn't finish her food or the broccolini she ordered. She said it was \"pretty good\" and she took the leftovers for later. She had never had wild boar and decided it tasted like \"regular type meat\". 

Two of our four top ordered tiramisu. I tasted a bite of it. It looked house made, like it was cut from a big giant pan. They gave you a pretty hefty slice of it too. The tiramisu was the star of the entire dinner. They raved about how delicious it was, and to be real, it was super good. Some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. 

We got our bill, split it four ways, I'll take care of the meat plate I said. The wine can be split between the three checks if that's possible (it was). 

I got my bill, with tip... $115. (Cocktail, 1/3 wine, meat plate, salad, filet) So definitely not an everyday spot for me. I definitely do not make enough money or would want to try to justify spending that much on dinner weekly. I think when we do this again we'll pick a different restaurant that's a little more budget friendly."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try Senti for a while after reading an article in the Trib. We went on a Saturday night with four other couples and had a great meal. The decor was nice - clean and modern.  My wife and  I both had the scallops special which was awesome.  A good portion and very filling. Others in the group had the roast pork, linguine, and probably something else that I am forgetting. Everyone was very happy with the food - both quantity and quality.  We skipped dessert but regretted it after seeing what others in the group ordered. Luckily they offered us a bite... Amazing. 

We were a little concerned about service because most of the servers we saw looked pretty young but service turned out to be excellent.  I would give Senti a very high rating all around and would definitely recommend it. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch on Father's Day.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Senti is a refreshing experience with authenticity and soul. The immediate impact of the ambiance is open, bright and welcoming. The owner adds to the experience with his genuine warmth. The wine selection is fantastic and you should arrive early to take advantage of their fun wine machine. This machine allows you to taste small pours of potentially higher priced wines. Just enjoy it, it is fun! The food is authentic Italian with fresh pastas and seasonal ingredients. We loved the tiramisu and definitely have the amaro if you enjoy after dinner drinks. The perfect spot for a celebratory experience with friends!"}
{"text":"Everyone who works here is very hospitable, but that being said, it's a pretty classy restaurant. I've been here for dinner twice, and the majority of the crowd look like they just got off work in their business casual/formal attire. 

The food here is good, although portion sizes are kind of small for what you pay for. I love the lasagna here almost as much as I love the one from Piccolo Forno, but the portion is maybe 1/3 of Piccolo Forno's. I was able to devour an appetizer, pasta, and dessert, and still felt like I could eat more food after that meal. 

The food and ambiance are great, but docking a star for prices and portion size"}
{"text":"I live in the building above Senti and wanted to give it a try. My girlfriend and I figured we could walk in this past Saturday night around 7pm but they were booked solid. We were offered the lounge area but fortunately there was a cancellation and we were shown to a table. The service was friendly and prompt. The first thing to come out was some bread. It was a salted focaccia with rosemary and it was amazing. Some of the best bread I've ever had. We both had wines which were good to start off the meal. From there we went straight into entrees. She had the salmon which was breaded, and she said it was excellent. I don't even eat seafood, and the bite I tried was very tasty. I went with the ribeye which was a special that night. It was a pan cooked steak but it was excellent as well. Had a great flavor and was cooked right. The side with the steak was a salad which was just OK, but overall I was very satisfied with both my wine and steak. The atmosphere in Senti was also very nice and modern. The crowd was on the older side but the place had a good vibe. Senti is definitely a great asset to the neighborhood and I'm sure I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Senti is still new. But I can't grade on a curve. The food was just average. Nothing extraordinary . Fine but not worth the 60 minutes it took to plate after the salads were removed. By the time the entrees arrived, hardly warm, we had consumed several bottles of expensive and unique to Pittsburgh Italian wines.
Perhaps that was the motivation. 
The manager seemed unaware as to the pacing and only bothered to say hello once the cheque had been presented."}
{"text":"I very rarely have time for lunch. So I was excited to meet my wife out for a rare mid day date. Senti was the place, contemporary, bright and cheerful. My server was delightful and attentive. It was a Friday during lent so I was pleased to find fish on the menu. My wife had the salmon salad and I had the salmon entree. The fish was cooked perfectly and seasoned in a way that astonished me. Probably the best piece of salmon I ever had.  Bravo, and Keep up the great work. I cant wait to see what the chef will come up with in the future."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time. The food presentation was nice, but was a bit bland. Tiramisu was very good."}
{"text":"Very good new restaurant! The bread is homemade as well as the pasta dishes. I had the gnocchi, and my husband had the lasagna. The wine was very good as well. The highlight of the dinner was the desserts! We had tiramisu, pana cotta, apple tart, and a flour less chocolate cake. Each was better than the last! The restaurant is very modern and trendy. Franco was the manager at Lidias and decided to open his own restaurant. Much luck to him and the team!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday night for dinner with my wife and another couple.  We had reservations for 7:15 and arrived around that time to be immediately seated.  The inside of Sentis is quite interesting and modern.  They have a nice lounge type area with a bar and then a number of tables behind that.  There is also another room that it looked like they were using for a rehearsal dinner the night that we were there and so we didn't really get to see it.

My wife and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the fritto misto.  It consisted of fried carrots, zucchini, peppers, calamari and shrimp and was quite good.  The breading on it was rather light yet crispy and everything was seasoned perfectly.  I was especially impressed that the calamari was tender as most places tend to over cook it and make it rubbery.  Then for my dinner entree I went with one of the specials for the evening which was lamb t-bones.  It consisted of 3 lamb medallions over top of some gnocchi, peas and mushrooms and had some dollops of pur√©ed carrots and a smearing of black garlic on the plate.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and tasted pretty good.  Senti let the flavor of the lamb come through and didn't try to hide it.  The gnocchi was also decent although I think that they were a little denser than i would have liked.  I did enjoy the flavor produced by dragging them through the black garlic though.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Everything that we had was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and was not disappointed! The prefix menu had a salad to start, a choice in entree (pork and chicken or white fish), and tiramisu for dessert. I got the fish and it was so tender and flavorful. My bf got the duck and his mom got the pork/chicken and we all loved our meals. We got the mussels to start and let me tell you, some of the best mussels I've had. Simple white wine sauce. The house made focaccia is super fresh and just delectable. Will definitely be going back to try some of their pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Ambience was nice but my meat was undercooked and they brought it back 20 min later very dry ,not impressed wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Although I bookmarked Senti MONTHS ago, I didn't have the opportunity to dine there until recently. Reservations were made for 4 people at 7:15 on a recent Saturday. When I walked into the restaurant, I was immediately surprised by the decor- floor to ceiling windows, white furnishings, exposed duct work. The appearance of the restaurant is very clean and modern. After looking over the extensive wine list (wow!), I went with a wine I was familiar with while hubs asked the waitress for her opinion. We were both very pleased with our selections. 

Our waitress was knowledgable about the menu and was able to answer questions regarding my current dietary restrictions. I started my meal with the mixed salad. Great start, good size tasty dressing. The accompanying bread was also delicious. For my main course, I decided on the pork medallions which were accompanied by grilled radicchio, white beans and sausage. The pork and the sausage were both cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The beans were a miss for me as I would have preferred a pasta (gnocchi). Service did seem to be backed up most likely due to a large party that was receiving their food before we received ours. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This will be a short update to our first review of Senti. To get straight to the point, the service issue has been resolved if last night's dinner was representative of the place. Service was excellent, and it was the same waitress who severely disappointed us the last time. Now if they would put some California Chardonnay on the wine list they might warrant five stars. I get the point of offering only Italian wines in an Italian restaurant, but the food world should stop being politically correct and come out and admit that Italian whites range from poor to absolutely undrinkable. The reds, of course, compensate, so why not just admit it."}
{"text":"Really unfortunate experience here.  Came for the concept of the wine tasting options but the wine was probably old - definitely not a good representation of quality italian wine. 

The food was very mixed.  The bread and the prosciutto appetizer were good, but anything that actually needed to be cooked or prepared was disappointing. The ribeye steak special was thin and very overlooked (medium rare = mostly gray throughout, and tough). The fettuccini was overlooked and chewy.  Paired with the wine it all made sense together as a disappointment. 

For the price, this place is a huge letdown. If this were a $30 meal for two I would've been impressed but for $200, money would be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the emerging and constantly evolving Pittsburgh food scene. The options are ever changing and pushing the limits. I also love Edison bulbs reclaimed wood and that industrial ambience that every single recent location has.  That being said from the moment you walk in Senti you realize it is different.  It's bright.  It's authentic.  It has a warm Italian welcome of the sincere and genuine owner. 

The menu is legit and is a true taste of Italy with fresh ingredients and home made pastas. The wine list is superb.  The service and setting is great.  

Try the burrata appetizer, the lasagna and the tiramisu.  

This is a perfect location for a romantic night out or a celebration with friends. Yes I will still be interested in that brand new restaurant down the street with a new take on pork and chalk board painted walls but today Give me Senti!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with a friend. I loved the atmosphere. It's decorated chic and modern but, had a more casual vibe to it which I liked. You could wear a dress or nice jeans if you wanted. The prices are reasonable for the area it's located in and for how nice it is on the inside. Entrees ranged from $18-$25. The only thing negative I would say is it seemed like a smaller menu with maybe 6 entrees to pick from. Although sometimes I find it nice to not have so many choices. Overall I would definitely go back. For $43 plus tip I got a salad, entree, glass of wine, and dessert."}
{"text":"Senti ownership deserves only 1 star, but the extra star is for the chef because the food is truly delicious.  I have been twice, once with my wife and another couple and a second time with a group of 5 other friends.

The first time, it took over 45 minutes for us to be seated against a reservation for which we were on time.  The manager did buy as an appetizer and round of drinks but when we sat down the service remained extremely slow.  However, the quality of food and manager's response to our long wait time drove me to giving Senti a second chance.  

When dining with a group of 5 friends, we were sat on time (it was a Tuesday).  The process from the time we sat down until departing the restaurant was 2.5 grueling long hours.  We enjoyed ourselves and filled the long periods of time where we were waiting to order, waiting for our food or waiting for a drink with fun and entertaining conversation.  However, by the time we found ourselves waiting again for the bill, we all looked at each other thinking \"let's get the heck out of this place and never come back.\"

I am a pay for performance tipper with a range from 10% if you are a complete disaster to 35% for an amazing experience with a standard average of 20%.  I was even more annoyed when an 18% gratuity was added because there were 6 of us and I did not get my opportunity to express my discontent via what would have likely been a 10-12% tip, so thanks to Yelp for helping me to express myself."}
{"text":"Arrived on Friday at 7:45 for our reservations. Took about 10 extra minutes to be seated so we appreciated the beautiful art and decor. It was not super busy which was nice- less noise. We ordered the lasagna and salads and were very pleased. Brian, our waiter, was very courteous. The music was at a soft volume and it was mellow jazz very conducive to conversations and dinner. Some contemporary Italian music would have been great. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was very authentic. Lasagna wasn't very tomatoieee. The food felt fresh and prepared with details. 

ThE tiramisu is to die for. I highly recommend trying all the desserts."}
{"text":"Terrible. Poop central. Waited forever....service slow as f*ck at 8p Saturday night. 
For a full size cheese plate if you enjoy 2 pieces of the same kind of cheese (Parmesan) and 8 pieces of prociutto with no crackers..one measley piece of cauliflower the size of a fingernail, limp carrots, pickled celery and a raw onion bulb, then you're in for a real treat! Bone appetite."}
{"text":"Great, classy spot! The owner is wonderful and really makes every table feel special! We started out with salad and split an appetizer. And had pasta for the main course. The pasta was just a bit dry, so we asked olive oil on the side and ravioli was in a broth, which added an interesting flavor profile to the sweet squash filling - maybe a more hearty filing would be better in the future, as the filling was coming out into the broth, leaving just ravioli pasta. Some of the other tables had protein courses that came out, which looked really good. Looking forward to trying this spot again and seeing how they incorporate other seasonal food into classical Italian food."}

{"text":"Went out for a birthday celebration at Senti. The food was an overall 3 stars however the service was well below average and is why I am rating Senti a 2. We had the mushroom pasta, the seafood spaghetti, ravioli, and ragu. The octopus and beet salad were good. But the stuffed calamari was fishy-I would recommend passing on this dish. The seafood pasta was also watery-the sauce too thin and lacked flavor. They were out of the gnocchi. Why not make more? It was only 6pm. 

The service was disappointing and below the level that you expect for a restaurant in this price range. The woman who greeted us from the bar was not friendly. Our waitress seemed untrained and was asking when we wanted our courses brought out. 

She was also not knowledgeable about the wine selection and did not check in us after dropping our entrees regarding our food or drink. Was this because we were a large party and her tip was already factored in? She seemed more concerned with providing her friends at the table next to us a wine tasting. 

We may come back but Senti will not be high our list. Many other great options for Italian throughout the city."}
{"text":"Our appetizer was cauliflower soup, and our entrees were fettuccine and gnocchi. The food tasted good but not worthy of our repeat business. The restaurant was not busy with customers, but the waitress was a little slow in taking our order and bringing out our food and drinks. Dress code is casual."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 8 friends during the Pittsburgh Restaurant week. I would give the place a 3.5
Firstly, the ambience was really impressive. Large windows, clean modern interiors, white wall and modern art. The waitress was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions and took our dietary considerations into mind. 
When we had called, we did mention the restaurant week menu, which was a pretty simple menu: salads, entree and dessert. There were no options between them except that we could replace the kind of meat in the entree. What was not impressive was that they took forever to get our dishes to come out. Almost 30 minutes for the salad !?! Then another 20 for the entree. And the dessert took some time to come out too. Most of us were not pleased that the service was this slow, considering there were hardly any other customers in the restaurant.
That being said, the food was on the impressive scale. Our salad consisted of carrots, oranges and candied pecans, and was delightful. The Farro con Scelta was good too , nothing to call out. I was looking forward to the tiramisu, but was disappointed. The restaurant week tiramisu was a much smaller version of the regular one, with much more cream, and less cake. A friend got the regular sized version and I could see the difference between the 2.
Overall, this place has really good potential to up their game, and make the experience better."}
{"text":"Dry, overcooked food. Slow service. Money would be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful new restaurant! I was pleasantly surprised.  Everything was so delicious, service was prompt and attentive, free wifi, comfy hang out area by the bar, amazing artwork and very inexpensive for the quality of food served.  There is parking across the street.  The desserts are just evil. They are so scrumptious you will want to try everything! The coffee Budino is to die for!   I really like the wine dispenser too, you can buy a reload able card and serve yourself!  Franco has some excellent wines to try.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Lots to like - it feels sleek and cool. Service is impeccable. Cocktails were great and we enjoyed everything we ate - the lasagna is outstanding and they treat vegetables with respect. I'd recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner here tonight with a group of professional women. We had several bottles of wine, appetizers, entrees and desserts. All of the courses were delicious and the staff were so warm, accommodating and friendly. We had a great night at Senti!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best restaurants I have been to.  My girlfriend and I came a little early and sampled a couple cocktails at the bar.  Very well made and the service was tremendous.  The entire staff was top notch. I have to mention the bread, the focaccia bread. I was worried about having enough room for my meal because the bread just melted in your mouth. I ended up going with the duck as my main entree.  Probably the best duck that I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly and a portion size was spot-on. My girlfriend and I finished off the meal by splitting a Tiramisu and a couple of cocktail drinks. I've had a lot of tiramisu through the years and this was by far the best Tiramisu I've ever eaten.  The owner Franco stopped by our table, while at most restaurants managers and/or owners kind of just do the hey how you doing how is everything, Franco seemed to really care about experience and our meal and that we were satisfied. I highly recommend Senti if you are looking for great service and great meal and a great experience."}
{"text":"Senti: A good, but forgettable meal.

A friend had been wanting to try this place and I am always down for something new so was excited to check it out. Most reviews are correct in that the place does feel a bit like a hotel lobby, but to its defense it does feel like a swanky NYC sushi restaurant, which I was totally comfortable with.

The menu looked interesting, but it was the specials that sung to us during our visit. Ordering the Bronzino and the salmon, we also wanted to try a mix side dishes: the bread pudding and fried polenta. We were both pleasantly surprised by both but were quickly distracted with dessert.

The best part of our meal was absolutely the tiramisu. It's honestly the only part I remember because I remember thinking it was the perfect balance of having a coffee flavor with chocolate.

I probably won't go back, except for maybe a glass of wine and more tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I went tonight, and a wonderful time. The decor is one that is very modern, comfortable and very inviting. Being a very selective eater the waitress really made the meal a great experience. From the wine selection to the food everything I tried was a delightful especially the coffee pudding.  You truly get the experience of higher class dining from the ambiance to the quality of food but at a fraction of the price. This restaurant is just a wonderful addition to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a interesting restaurant with a modern flair that is well worth a visit.  Service staff was competent, pleasant, and a little offbeat, which was fine with me.  I liked that they had interesting cocktail specials (all involving blood orange flavor the night we visited).

The pasta was definitely good, but not great, which some 5-star reviews have suggested.  It's not like eating in Italy, but the recipes have interesting twists.  Recommend the tagliatelli puttanesca which was soft, rich, and delivered the right level of puttanesca spiciness.

Desserts were similarly good.

What I liked most about this restaurant was the value of a gourmet experience and the laid back atmosphere.  It's classy, but not stuffy.  One feels welcome to linger and enjoy the whole meal."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner.  Excellent food with attentive waitstaff.  Would defiantly recommend it and would go again.  Highlights were the fish special, lasagna and lemon dessert."}
{"text":"I visited Senti a little while back for my first ever restaurant week experience (I know, crazy) and I have to say it was a great first experience. Looking at the photos on yelp it seemed like a upscale restaurant so we dressed nice for the occasion. I was a little nervous that we may be overdressed because that seems to happen a lot in the Pittsburgh area but thankfully we were dressed appropriately. 

It's a cute little place that doesn't have a whole lot of tables. It had a very intimate, date night feel to it. I would say its a place better suited for parties of 2. Smaller parties would probably be ok but definitely not large parties.

For our courses we got a caprese salad and spaghetti with meatballs and marinara. It sounds boring but it's all authentic italian so it wasn't just your average pasta. I'm not even a huge meatball fan but I really liked these meatballs. I liked that they were smaller meatballs rather than huge meatballs. Something about the smaller ones just tastes better for some reason.

As far as the service goes, I was very pleased. They waitress was very attentive and checked on us periodically. She was able to suggest a wine for our meal that we both enjoyed. The owner was also walking around checking on tables to ask how everything was which is always a nice gesture. After this experience I would definitely like to go back some time and check out the full menu. Possibly my next date night!"}
{"text":"At first I wasn't sure I was cool enough to eat at this restaurant. It's fresh modern take on food is as enticing as it is delicious. I'm so glad I decided to stick around and enjoy a wonderful meal that I will not soon forget. Well done Senti, well done!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and my friends brought me here for dinner, because they come here very often. I started with the beet salad, which was really delicious and creative. And then I had their lasagna, which I was told was amazing and it really is. It's not heavy like some other restaurants and it's just the right size portion.

I finished off with their seasonal tart, which was an apple tart tonight, and again, it was the right size, fresh and delicious. The owner is on-site and very friendly, and the service was really nice.

My friends had the lamb chops, the steak and the special of the night which was Beef short ribs. For dessert they had the tiramisu, the profiterole's and the chocolate bread pudding. They all loved their dinner and desserts."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous meal! With lovely service! They were very accommodating to our party of 8 for a last min change of plans to go. We enjoyed the lovely weather as we sat on their patio and each had such great appetizers, dinners, drinks, and desserts!"}
{"text":"My first time at Senti. I had heard great things so I needed to try for myself.  I was not disappointed.

First its important to note the description on their website, \"authentic Italian food, traditional European service, and modern wining and dining.\"  What stood out to me was the \"traditional European service.\"  Translated, that means sloooow.  Please dont go to Senti if you are in a hurry or have to be somewhere by a specific time.  My wife and I were seated for 2 1/2 hours!  We knew that going in and were perfectly fine taking our time to enjoy the experience.  The spacing of the food delivery allows you to eat slowly and savor the flavors while enjoying your wine.  That's exactly what we did.  

We started off with the cheese plate.  There were 3 cheeses with some crostini, apple & pear slices, a very yummy mostarda and a pool of honey on the bottom of the plate.  I couldnt tell you what the cheeses were but there was something like provolone, a soft white cheese and a blue cheese.  It was perfect all around from flavors to sizes to pairings. 

We skipped salads and pastas and went straight to entrees.  I got the salmon off the menu and my wife got the special wahoo fish.  We also got a side of brocollini.  Ive never had salmon cooked so perfectly or with such flavor (from the honey mustard and dill sauce).  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her wahoo which came on a bed of farro and spinach.   Even the brocollini, which were sauteed with garlic, were cooked to perfection with tons of flavor.

For dessert, my wife's tiramisu was probably the best tiramisu Ive ever had.  I got the Torta della Stagione which was an apple pie that day, with a side of cinnamon ice cream.  The crust on the pie was unbelievable and the ice cream, the perfect complement.  

I will definitely return and would recommemd trying here at least once.  The only negative was the near $200 bill for two of us but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, but the service was really terrible.  Wouldn't go back for that reason. The waiter seemed totally overwhelmed but we had to ask for things like water and pepper repeatedly. The table beside us was there definitely before us and we were done eating our dinner and they were literally having to ask where their food was. No drink refills, no alcohol refill offers and we were not offered desert. Food was fine but too bland to put up with the bad service again."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday, January 27th. 
I moved to Pittsburgh from Manhattan exactly a week ago. My palette was very spoiled for 4 1/2 years. I'm used to giving restaurants outside of the city a little slack because I know it's crazy to expect a place to live up to what I'm used to there. Senti did!

Our server Marissa was great. We both ordered salads that we were very happy with. And the bread is delicious. When my boyfriend and I go to italian restaurants we like to order both the pasta and then an entree. 
I got the truffle butter ravioli and he ordered the spaghetti. They were delicious. We thought about the gnocchi and the lasagna, but when we saw them brought out to another table, we realized how HUGE they were and knew that if we went that way, we would have no room for our entrees. Both of our pasta's were delicious and portioned-well, but small enough that we would be able to keep going.

He ordered the pork which was insanely tender and delicious. I'm not a huge pork fan and I loved it. I ordered the duck which was great and not as fatty as the duck I've gotten other places. 

For dessert he got the last chocolate bread pudding which was VERY rich and delicious and I ordered the tiramisu which I'm not normally huge fan of (I would have ordered the bread pudding if they had more than one, but it was my boyfriend's birthday). 

Our dinner included: 3 glasses of wine, 2 salads, 2 pastas, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. After adding a 20% tip, it totaled around $190. (But I rounded up and paid $200 since Marissa was so great!)

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I am long overdue in submitting a review. I have lived in the neighborhood for the past 14 months (ok-they are a block from my home...) and have loved being so close by to Senti. I have lived in other cities with a great foodie scene, and I travel a fair amount for work, so I am fortunate to try different excellent restaurants.

Senti is an absolute gem. They provide upscale Italian cuisine in a simple , light filled modern space. However, there is not a stuffy feel to the place. The owners set a positive tone for the restaurant: they are warm, professional, and are actively involved in the daily operations of the restaurant. The food is excellent in both quality of ingredients and presentation. The staff are knowledgeable and efficient but down to earth. I admit that I am at Senti at least once weekly and it has become one of my \"go to\" restaurants (along with Morcilla) for a wonderful meal (dine in, at the bar, or to go) in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"This unfinished review is killing me. Yelp ate my first draft somewhere...back there....

Anywho, the long and short:
-Get the soup of the day, skip the house salad. Your money is better spent on the SOTD
-Ask the servers about wine! They have an exceptional knowledge of the wine! We got some fabulous pairing suggestions. (Even though we researched a bit beforehand.)
-Get the Pappardelle with Wild Boar Rag√π, Lasagna is a close second!!!!
-Get the Tiramisu - always

PS: Their fresh bread is delicious. Somewhere between focaccia and sourdough. I know we asked about it and our server was happy to divulge some bread info on it!"}
{"text":"We love this place. It is pricey, so dinner here is a special treat night thing, but the food is fantastic. More frequently, we'll pop in for dessert and drinks, which is absolutely worth it. They have a fantastic wine list and the tiramisu is heavenly.

We stopped in for our 5th or 6th visit this past weekend - for wine, dessert, and espresso after a birthday dinner elsewhere. While some other restaurants will sneer at you or act dismissive if you don't want dinner, Senti has consistently accommodated us and gone further, with excellent service that makes clear how much they value every customer. While we didn't ask this visit, in the past the in-house wine expert (she said she was not a sommelier) has generously spent time helping us explore the wine list, whether we were having dinner or just stopping in for dessert.

We'll continue to return and hope Senti remains a permanent addition to lower Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Dining at Senti was the absolute worst restaurant experience that I have ever had in my entire lifetime. We booked a reservation for Mother's Day brunch. When we arrived a few minutes early, we were told that our table wasn't ready. No big deal... until we waited 45 minutes until we were shoved into a table that was too small for our party because the table still was not ready. For some reason, the manager and wait staff refused to tell the party that there was a reservation behind them. The manager apologized and stated they would \"do something special\" for us. Once we were seated 45 minutes late, we waited ANOTHER 50 minutes in between our appetizer and entree courses. No apology given whatsoever at that point. Three of us god filets, all of which were over cooked and poor cuts. When one of us informed our waitress that the steaks were over cooked, she looked at us like we were inconveniencing her by telling her this. By the time that the check came, we had been in the restaurant for THREE HOURS. Would you think there would be a massive discount on the check, especially given what the manager said? Yep, so did we. What happened? We got $10 off of each filet, seemingly only to do with them being over cooked. No money off whatsoever for how long we waited. I was warned to not try this restaurant and I absolutely wish that I never had. They completely ruined all of the plans that we had for Mother's Day."}
{"text":"While on a visit with my daughter from Miami, someone recommended us this restaurant as a must visit restaurant and area of Pittsburg. We were pleasantly impressed. Before entering we already knew we have being properly recommended. The restaurant is designed and set up in a very elegant modern minimalist manner. The menu was equally impressive and varied enough to satisfy the more demanding appetites looking for sophisticated but affordable, authentic Italian flavors. Food presentation was totally on point. Their wine selection was excellent, and my college level daughter really enjoyed their self dispensing wine bar. But the most impressive part of our experience was the awesome service we received from the entire staff, but especially our waiter Sofia and the owner Franco. From the moment we got to restaurant,  to half an hour before they close; they told us not to worry about that and they meant it. From the foods, wines, to places to visit afterwards suggestions; they could not have done a better job of accommodating and making us feel welcome both at their restaurant and their city. Lawrenceville, the area this restaurant is located in is an up and coming part of Pittsburg with a really cool vibe. We would definitely be back and would highly recommend as a must visit when in town."}
{"text":"I was surprised with a \"happy last final\" dinner here the other week. Boy, what a great place to celebrate something special. First off, when I entered the restaurant we were greeted by the host who made a big deal out of my graduation. That was awesome that they remembered why my partner reserved a table and that they said something so they could share in part of it. We got a table that faced Butler Street and really it was perfect. The snow was falling and those big Windows let us look out onto Lawrenceville with a beautiful layer of snow and the snowflakes coming down. It was the perfect scene for the celebration of my last final of grad school. I really could not have asked for a better place than that. The server that we had was fantastic. She let us take our time with the menu, she laughed with us over my accomplishments, and she gave us some great suggestions on food. Perfecto.

Rucola Salad:
We got a salad to share between the two of us. I was a little concerned at first that it wouldn't be enough but I had nothing to worry about. The salad was filling even when split between both of us. It had little pieces of fennel nice chunks of Parmesan cheese and a very light dressing on it. And I believe cranberries. Very good.

Fritto Misto:
Fried Seafood and Vegetables Served with a Horseradish Marinara Sauce and Horseradish Aioli. This appetizer was also delicious. The serving size was pretty good, but with a lot of fried food I'm sure that I could have eaten more. I liked it a lot more when we sprinkle the lemon over it. Both of the sauces were okay but neither one of them really were my favorite. But I really really loved this dish and I didn't need much sauce in order to be fantastic.

Lasagna alla Veneta:
Lasagna, Veneta Style, House-Made Pasta with Beef Ragu, Cheese and Bechamel Sauce. While this was not my dish, I did get a little bite of it. The bechamel sauce was delicious and something that I was not used to on lasagna. My partner loved it and he is a big lasagna eater. This one that he ordered had arugula baked in it. While he was apprehensive at first, he did state wow I like arugula. Not realizing that are salad had arugula in it also. He liked the spiciness of the lettuce.

Osso Buco di Maiale:
Braised Pork Shank Served with Roasted Sweet Potato, Multi-Colored Cauliflower, Mashed Potatoes and Gremolata. This was fantastic. The pork was fall off the bone and done to perfection. The cauliflower and mashed potatoes with the sauce on top yum. My sweet potatoes could have been cooked a little bit more but they were still really good. I had enough to eat for lunch the next day, that's how big this dish was. It was a perfect dinner dish tha was large enough for leftovers.

Dessert:
We opted out of dessert. Quite frankly all of that food was so filling I didn't think that we could stuff anymore in our bellies. But because it was a special occasion our waitress put one little scoop of honey ice cream in a dish with a candle. I loved that gesture. It is things like that that make me come back to restaurants the extra effort to make someone feel special. And that really did make me feel special. The ice cream was also delicious and I lick that bowl clean.

I cannot wait to come here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but I didn't.   From the dry sausage, bean, and pear dressing accompanying my ok pork to the pleasant but inattentive service to the, IMHO, tacky white leather decor, I just did not enjoy it.   some of the food is ok, but nothing memorable.  The wine selection is nice.  I left feeling annoyed, and when I finally got the waittress' s attention to get the check, was glad to close the door behind me on a totally forgettable dining experience.   I will not return."}
{"text":"Short Version: this place mess up pork belly. If you are a true foodie, you know what that means.

Long Version: We had to much high hope for Senti. From the online articles, reviews to friends' recommendations, we thought this would be another hit spot for us foodies in PIttsburgh. Unfortunately, it was not. While the ambience was nice and I can see the owner's visions in the settings, the food was very disappointing. First, it was not well plated: no art on the plate here :/. Second and most importantly, the food was very underwhelming. My first dish was pork belly with grilled polenta. The pork belly was clearly reheated multiple times and completed dried out and over cooked. It was chewy and hard to eat. I was impressed how much they can mess up a pork belly dish. The grill polenta was along the same scale, very dry due to multiple reheating cycles. For entree, I got their salmon dish. The salmon was good, but nothing special. They re-use the same grill polenta from the appetizer in this dish. It did not go well with the salmon, and again the polenta was very dry and clearly reheated and not made fresh. Lastly, the presentation might be one of the worse I have seen. It reminded me plates from a local diner at 11pm. Overall, for the price of the food, I definitely would not recommend this restaurant. Try Cure down the street or Spoon in  east liberty. There are so many good restaurants in the city at this or a lower price level."}
{"text":"I visited Senti last night for dinner. Before I go to any restaurant, I review photos and read reviews so I know what to expect. I had high expectations since I saw relatively good reviews on service and food quality. However, after my experience last night I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a high standard of food quality. I ordered the breaded chicken breast. It was paired with carrots and a arugula salad. Let's just say, you could have made this meal at home. I received two pieces of breaded chicken strips (yes, similar to Burger King chicken strips), chopped baby carrots, and plain arugula with a light dressing. Chicken was greasy and it was visible on the plate. I give this restaurant one star because the service was good! Our waiter was friendly.  

Very disappointed! Total bill was $90 for two entries and two glasses of wine. Would love to have my money back as the food quality was that poor! 

I love Lawrenceville and Butler Street, but I would not recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"An impromptu girls night out was the goal of the evening...and Senti delivered.  Due to schedules we needed to dine a little earlier than normal, and when we arrived at 6:00 we were somewhat suprised that we were the ONLY patrons there at that time.  Nonetheless, the hostess greeted us happily and seated us in the beautiful dining room.  Within 30 minutes or so there were several other tables in use, and the energy was picking up.  The decor and seating is beautiful, and comfortable, and the staff could not have been more friendly!  

We both ordered a great glass of wine, which was accompanied by some amazing housemade foccacia.  Yep...we asked for more of that.  We decided to stick with the classics and ordered the gnocchi with beef ragu, and spaghetti pomodoro, with a side of broccolini to share.  Both dishes were delicious, the pasta was prepared al dente to perfection and that pomodoro sauce....welll....thankfully we had enough foccacia that none of it went to waste!  
We pushed the envelope a little and decided to try our hand at the desserts.   We had the chocolate bread pudding and while it was good, but not anything to write home (or yelp) about.  Not compared to the amazing pasta dishes that just reminded me how authentic pasta should taste!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.

Came here for Restaurant Week with a group of 7 other friends. When we walked in, it felt like we were going to get a treat. The dining room is bright and fancy and at the time, was filled with many other guests who seemed to be enjoying themselves. The service was friendly albeit a bit haphazard (e.g., forgetting my drink, not being able to get their attention, etc.).

I ended up going off the regular menu because aside from the entree, the dishes on the restaurant week menu didn't appeal to me.

I decided to go with two appetizers: a seared scallop dish and a pork belly dish.

The scallops were seared nicely and well-seasoned. I think they must be working out what they want to put on this dish because the complements were not the ones listed on the menu and didn't quite work for me -- the mushrooms were a bit overcooked and limp, and I (and this is an unpopular opinion) am not a fan of sweet potato but also it did not seem well-cooked. Overall I was ok with this dish.

The pork belly was utterly disappointing. It tasted almost like it had been freezer-burned and was tough rather than tender. It came with polenta that was listed as grilled but was actually fried and it tasted alright but dried out and did not add much to the dish.

I got the Budino al Cafe for dessert. The glazed donut holes were fine though barely glazed, and the coffee pudding was flavorful though was a bit... spongier(?) than I've had for a budino. Maybe this is the style but it was difficult to see how the donut holes would be eaten with this. Also, again, overall ok.

The rest of the table also seemed unimpressed by the meal. Pretty much everything was either not great or only ok. (The osso bucco off the Restaurant Week menu seemed to be one of the better dishes.) Unfortunately (or fortunately?), with the multitude of great restaurants in Pittsburgh, there isn't a reason for me to return."}
{"text":"The gnocchi is divine. It had a braised pork red sauce that was bursting with flavor. The drinks are expensive but creative and strong. Our server was spectacular, even with dealing with our large, loud party of 13."}
{"text":"Restaurant was woefully unprepared for the Mother's Day crowd. 

First, the positive. Nice decor and the food was well prepared. Squash blossoms and scallop appetizer were excellent. Pasta ragu and salmon were well done. The porchetta benedict, though flavorful, was more like 
shredded pork and it was dry.  Desserts were ok, but a bit sweet. 

Unfortunately, the service was painfully slow. It was a prix fixe menu, but they did not have their act together.  What I found inexcusable was when they subbed out salmon for branzino without asking. Sure, the dish was prepared well, but at this price point, once expects the courtesy of being asked. Cannot recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Didn't ask how we want our beef cooked. Very overpriced. Crowded place for gatherings. Service was not nice either."}
{"text":"Saturday evening and they ran out of 2 menu items. Our seats were bumped as each server passed by during the entire meal. Meals were served across our plates while we were eating. Salad lacking anything which would make it worth the price, steak the same.  Trying hard to be an \"upmarket\" restaurant but lacking a lot of the finish and style that would make it so.
Forgot, they had no sugar.  Bit of a worry when a restaurant is out of sugar. Very presumptive to have your 20% already on the check .Will never return."}
{"text":"We went there last night for a group dinner- it was a Tuesday so the place was fairly empty.

We sat down at 7, and somehow didn't get to order until 7:30. Our waiter really seemed more like we were bothering him- as did the rest of the wait staff. We didn't get first course of salad until 8:10, entrees came at 8:50.  I got the gnocchi as did 5 other people at our table and we all thought it was a little less than so-so- though other people did seem to enjoy their food(specifically eggplant and lasagna). Which is why I gave this 2 stars and not one.

At 9:20 we all started asking for checks....which took another 20 min. The first person left the marathon dinner at 9:50.

I don't know if it was because we were a big group (12) or the service is just that bad. I can't say I'll never go back- but I won't be back unless it's for a special event or someone else really insists on going there...."}
{"text":"Steak was over cooked. Food is not good and the restaurant is hard to find. The tiramisu was not properly made, and it is way too sweet."}
{"text":"Second visit to this beautiful space with large windows and minimalist, white decor accented with modern art on the walls. Convenient location with decent street and surface lot parking. Quiet setting, good for conversation. 

The food was...well, just ok. My sweet Italian sausage stuffed squid starter (Calamari Ripieni) was done just right in a generous, nearly entree-sized portion. I should have stopped there and enjoyed the Super Tuscan wine the server recommended. For the second course I chose what I hoped would be a light vegetarian entree, \"Zucca Fritta - Lightly Battered Cardamom Spiced Kabocha Squash and Eggplant Served with Butternut Squash, Wheat Berries, Daikon and Watermelon Radish Slaw.\" You can judge from the picture but it was anything but lightly battered. More like a State Fair style deep fried vegetable. And not at all healthy.

Service was just OK too. Had to pour our own wine after the first glass. Dinner for 4 people with one bottle of ($52) wine came to $222 before tip. Nice setting but not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Ambiance is very nice.  Big windows looking out on Butler Street, great little outdoor area for summertime.  Inside, elegant white furnishings and really comfortable seats.  

The bar has a wine machine--you know, one of those things that you buy a card and can use it to dispense wine and get various tastings.  The people I was with all love it and found it novel--not really my thing; would just as soon order from the waitress or bartender, but I can see the advantage of being able to taste various wines.

Food was good--we spoke to the owner who shared that he grows some of the food himself and sources almost all of it locally.  Service was always great.  Definitely a nice date place or good for a business dinner (which I've used it for a couple of times)."}
{"text":"Senti Senti Senti. Never have I been dissappointed here. A great operation with fresh amazing food. Great wine great drinks and a great owner. Celebrated a birthday with friends last night. This place is one of my favorites. Lasagna, Pork Osso Bucco. Tiramisu cocktails great bottle of sparkling Lambrusco. And a complimentary champagne for us. Great evening"}
{"text":"A new restaurant I'm always going to give leeway on. They've got to have some time to work out the kinks and get into a good rhythm. I totally understand that. That being said, my experience at Senti was totally fine. While I was not blown away, I do see potential.

It's a beautiful space, they've really made it a swanky restaurant. It's pretty big too. there's a decent size bar/lounge area and dining room. It's all decked out in white colors, you kinda feel like you're in Miami, except now it's the dead of winter and anything but.

We had very friendly and attentive service. Our bread basket came promptly, as did all our drinks and food. While my negroni was good, I felt it was a little heavy on the compari and not enough gin. 

My main dish was the swordfish and gnocchi. It was plated beautifully. I'd say my fish was very good and I loved the crispy skin, the gnocchi and sauce fell a little flat. I feel as if there could have been a little more flavor to the dish. 

I was very impressed with the tiramisu. It looks liked it had been freshly made and then sliced from a big pan (a generous slice at that) and it was very good. I like tiramisu when it's more cakey, and that's what this was. 

I'm interested in coming back and checking out there wine selection and seeing how they progress and time goes by!"}
{"text":"Yet another perfect experience at this lovely establishment!!! If you haven't been you simply MUST go. It's restaurant week in the burgh and though they were packed, the food was perfection and service was fantastic! The place is perfection for the nights you just need to be able to trust the chef. Clean yet inventive. I highly recommend the scallops. The wine list never disappoints. I especially love the wine bottles on tap. It's an upscale tasting room in front and restaurant in the back. The decor is clean and modern. I can't think of a better place to grab some appetizers and a glass of wine, maybe it will turn into to dinner."}
{"text":"So, we thought we would be here for a drink or two and dinner, and it ended up being an EVENT.

I don't even know where to begin.

The sommelier was so extremely helpful in navigating us to the correct wines for our taste and mood, and when we hadn't yet hit \"the mark\" on the wine of the evening, she continued to put forth excellent choices. At one point, the manager assisted us with even more insight. 

As for food, we were welcomed with marinated olives and decided upon two dishes for appetizers: the scallops and the mushrooms, both of which were exquisite, particularly the scallops which were perfectly seared.

Our entrees were the steak and pork tenderloin. Here's where we had a bit of a complaint. The steak was AMAZING. Medium rare to a T! Beautifully seasoned and a texture that melted in my mouth, then pair the wine with it and BAM! WOW!
The pork was another story. In fact, we questioned if it was the same chef who cooked the steak. Pork tenderloin medallions over a bed of white beans and chorizo and pearl onions. The tenderloin was overdone and dry, and there were supposed to be figs in the bed. There were three slices of figs. This dish wasn't even in the same ballpark as the steak. 

I would comment on the dessert, but we opted for bubbles. Quite a lovely selection of prosecco and brut, we landed on a brut rose that closed out our evening. My goodness, what an evening. 

It was an absolute pleasure to chat with the sommelier and the owner, and I sincerely look forward to dining here again."}
