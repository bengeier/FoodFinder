{"text":"Incredible Filipino home cooking. I've been there several times and the food never disappoints. The food is high quality and is not greasy. Most importantly the owners are good people. If you are new to the cuisine or eat Filipino all the time you'll enjoy yourself. Just go hungry!"}
{"text":"Delicious filipino foods!!! So glad to finally had gone to this place. Saturday from 1130am to 3pm they serve a delicious buffet of filipino foods. They dont make they same things everyday apparently but everything they had was great. Since moving to Cleveland for a little over a year now definitely miss my parents home cooking & this place just reminds me of home & how there's  always that variety of filipino whenever we have family parties. I was also able to order some halo halo dessert which was so delicious. There's also a store connected yo the restaurant so incase you need anything to make filipino food yourself at home you can purchase it from the store. Staff was great, lots of seats for family, price was very affordable. Definitely will be back here especially when i start to grave my home cooked filipino meal :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few years, but judging by others' recent reviews, I'm glad to know it's still going strong. 

The weekend buffet is spectacular. You are really cheating yourself if you don't go."}
{"text":"I went for the buffet and was incredibly disappointed. For $16.50 I was surprised my fave Filipino dishes were not on hand especially Adobo. None! This is a staple Filipino dish I thought for sure I would get some. I was looking forward to bisteak and none. I heard good things and that both wld be available but didn't have either today. The Sisig is not what I expected, dry and lacking the chillin and calamansi. Just seems they cooked the food fast and were missing the Filipino flavor of onion, garlic, and Patis I was expecting."}
{"text":"Brought a group of co-workers here for a weekday lunch excursion to sample Filipino food for the first time.  I was able to try several of their lunch dishes.  The pork BBQ was thick sliced pork roast grilled, but served cold (not sure if that was intentional or it just came out after cooling down).  Sides included spring rolls and a think noodle dish with veggies (onions, peppers, carrots).  Noodle dish had a hint of fish sauce.  The dipping sauce for the roll was of a sweet chili variety.

In addition to my meal, I sampled both the adobo (tangy) and afritada (sweet) chicken dishes and both were quite tasty.  The Filipino food seems pretty simple in its preparation, with subtle (rather than bold) flavors and a significant use of seafoods as well."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and overrated! You are better off going to any Asian stores like Cams or Shop to Park or Kainan for cooked filipino foods. 

I avoid this place like a plaque for the lady owner will try to sneak a charge or two if she can so watch her very carefully when she is charging you at the counter. At first, I thought it was an honest mistake but when she did it to me a couple more times I knew then that she is a cheat!

I definitely do not recommend this store!!!"}
{"text":"Came one Saturday afternoon to try this Philipino buffet after reading these Yelp reviews.  It was a charming experience- like joining some church potluck with lots of dishes in slow cookers and on the mix of serving plates.  There were over 20 choices of foods to try- and most of them were delicious.  It would be even better if all dishes were labelled, they weren't.  The Wife was a little weirded out because she didn't really know what she was eating at any particular time, but it was mostly delicious.  The fried whole fish was really tasty, but they didn't refill it after it had been picked apart which is  a shame, because it was probably the best thing there.  Also loved the stews and that purple rice cake dessert.  

It was not exactly cheap at $14 per person, but I think that I got my moneys worth and would not hesitate to go back in the future.  Come expecting a little hole in the wall and you'll appreciate it more."}
{"text":"There's no way the buffet is worth $12.95. The selection of entrees are very poor. It is mostly pork. The foods are NOT fresh at all. Not sure who cooks the food but it is definitely questionable. You can tell most of the foods are not prepared daily especially the lechon kawali and bbq."}
{"text":"The Saturday buffet is usually why we come here, it is decent enough. Some of the food is really good, other things are meh. Service is always friendly and efficient. I guess my one complaint is with the store. The prices are very high for certain items, especially things like rice cookers and household goods. I understand the need to make a profit, but it is excessive. They recently(last year or so)started selling beer and that is also too expensive... $3-4 dollars more here than any other place I've seen San Mig or Red Horse. I do appreciate the place considering the dearth of Filipino stores in NE Ohio. One last thing. I would not use the shipping service here, it takes much longer than they claim."}
{"text":"We're new to Cleveland metro area, we moved from west suburb of Chicago metro area, where there are variety of ethnic grocery stores & restaurants. Nipa Hut overall is average. Grocery items above average, fresh produce average. Seafood are all pre-packaged frozen. Several variety of fried fish. Locally cooked food below average, presentation & display of cooked food poor."}
{"text":"why has no one reviewed this place?  argh.

alright, i'll sacrifice myself.

nipa hut is a little bit of filipino happiness hidden on W 130th street. although nipa hut functions mostly as a grocery store, the place's saturday buffet has grown in the last few years from a few tables in the front of the store to a whole banquet room attached to the side.

now, i worked at a filipino bakery/restaurant for most of my adolescent years, and was raised on mom and grandma's ilokano cooking, so my expectations for filipino food deliciousness are high.  nipa hut is one of your few choices in the greater cleveland area, but this place ain't too bad.

favorites: the sour sinigang, crunchy lechon kawali, and peanut butter-y kare-kare.  there's plenty of white rice (no brown...oh well!) to eat with your baon, and a small but delicious array of desserts (mostly rice cakes).  don't know the foods i mentioned?  guess you need to make a visit to the saturday buffet, or if you can only make it on the weekdays, order a la carte.  if you're a vegetarian: i'm sorry, you can have the water."}
{"text":"Why the buffet doesnt serve hot?their dishes not into steaming pan or crackpot at least."}
{"text":"I moved to Ohio from Los Angeles in 2016 and have been craving Filipino food for almost a year now. 
I grew up eating Filipino food because my mom is Filipino, and I know how to make the recipes but they call for specific food items you can't really grab at giant eagle. Nipa Hut delivered so well, 100% authentic, total pinoy vibes just walking into the store, great grocery selections, naynay's cooking!!! You can't really ask for more. 
I wish I lived closer to be able to make it a regular grocery shop, but I will definitely be stopping here for my uncontrollable Filipino needs"}
{"text":"Have only ordered few items for take out , mostly excellent tasting PALABOK  in large pan  that's good for parties . DO NOT  order the KARE KARE: taste is ok but I was expecting more than four pieces of meat for the $35 I paid . Store appears clean and well stocked ."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many Filipino places, and I'm admittedly a harsh critic (1 star for Kapit Bahay in Las Vegas; 2 stars for Isla Pilipina in Chicago), but the Saturday buffet at Nipa Hut is easily the best of those three.  The buffet layout is simple and homey--food is cooked and brought out on dishes--sometimes a little sign will tell you what the dish is, sometimes not.  I wish I had taken better notes, but I remembered a couple of Filipino staples: Chicken adobo, lechon, pancit, menudo, kare kare, dinuguan, shanghai rolls, and whole fish.  I was also really surprised at a big plate of very large oysters, easily big and tasty enough to put a couple of non-seafood specialist places (steakhouses, in particular) to shame.  Unfortunately, there was no cocktail sauce to be found to go with oysters.  Of the dishes, I thought the menudo reminded me closest of home cooking, but I was really disappointed by the kare kare (my favorite dish) which was a little on the bland and runny side and completely bereft of any ox tail (though I can imagine at a buffet those chunks could go quickly).  Some tripe in there would have also been a well-appreciated bonus.  

There didn't appear to be any set menu (like you might see at a run of the mill Chinese restaurant buffet), so there's a little excitement knowing that anything could come out of the kitchen at any time.  It looked like there was also halo halo and leche flan available at an additional charge for dessert, but we were plenty full with the included offerings.  I would have loved to see some of my other Filipino favorites: empanadas, fresh lumpia, and callos.  The buffet lunch for 2 came out to about $28, which in my opinion, for the variety and uniqueness of the food, is entirely reasonable."}
{"text":"This was mine and the BF's first time eating at Nipa Hut since moving to the Cleveland area. He is Filipino, while I am not. 
On Saturdays from 11:30-2 they have an all you can eat buffet of different Filipino dishes. Lots of stews, meat prepared different ways, and seafood as well. A few things I recognized from the BF cooking at home, others were new to me. But everything I had was delicious. Im not gonna mention anything in particular, cause Im told the menu changes each week. However, if you enjoy Filipino food, or are looking for something different to try, I would for sure recommend coming here. 
The only reason Im giving this place 4/5 stars is because a few of the items, such as egg rolls, and a similar item called lumpia, as well as some skewered meat, was cold. BF says thats cause it's currently 47 degrees outside, but I feel a hot plate or heat lamp would benefit them."}
{"text":"Nipa Hut is a full-fledged Filipino grocery store. It has everything a Filipino needs... they even sell Magic Mic karaoke sets! Naks! Need halo-halo ingredients? You're set. Craving hopia? Otap? Pastillas? Sky flakes? Look no further. They even sell San Miguel and Red Horse beer, ay sus!

You can find some of these items at the Asian stores downtown, but this place is probably the most comprehensive of Filipino goods for your convenience. Expect items to be a little bit more expensive here, though. You're paying for the convenience and exclusivity. You can't get Red Horse anywhere else.

They also have a restaurant on the side, but I haven't eaten there so I can't comment on it. I can only say that it definitely passes the look and smell test. Sarap naman!"}
{"text":"My mom is filipino so, I'm always in here buying something for her. I have yet to try the buffet but, I've tried the refrigerated foods like the palabok & the siapio. Both are my favorite & are always very fresh. If you want a refreshing cold dessert, try the halo halo which is made to order. The magnolia ice creams are really good too."}
{"text":"The buffet is great my hubby loved it and he always ask me to go back there! Hihihi and finally found a filipino store!!"}
{"text":"I love hole-in-the-wall-back-of-the-market places like these. Because for it to survive, it has to offer something more substantial than good setting/location/service - good food! I've never truly had filipino food, so I was happy to try what appeared to be a very authentic looking place. How do I know it's authentic? I came for the saturday lunch buffet and I've never had a buffet where it looked like all the dishes were homemade. As if I went to someone house and all the asian grandmas were cooking in the kitchen. And it had a decent amount of people - mostly filipinos eating in the restaurant. Another confirmation that it's legit.  I would love to return and order their desserts (the pictures of the halo halo look amazing!) and dishes off the menu. This place definitely deserves more attention."}
{"text":"I've gone to Nipa Hut three times now. I'm not particularly knowledgeable about Filipino food, but I will say that this place delivers on high quality food nonetheless. The restaurant itself is fairly small, lending to a fairly \"homey\" atmosphere that is very relaxed and comfortable. The entrees stand alone don't offer much of variety, so I prefer to go during their Saturday morning buffets.

The buffet itself is well worth the price. Tea is complimentary, and aside from that the buffet has a wide variety of meats, vegetables, seafood, and desserts. I find it very admirable that Nipa Hut doesn't hold back on authenticity, opting to serve dinuguan and whole fish (with bones) as part of their buffet options. Their spring rolls are very good, and taste homemade as opposed to store bought. The various stews and stir fry dishes are also great, though I can't say I know much about their names or what's in the dishes. The barbecue chicken, while simplistic, is deceptively good, having been smoked for very long periods of time."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmm
Went here with a good pal of  mine, fellow Yelper BJ A. For my first encounter with Filipino food. Expectations were  extremely high. Keep in mind we drove 4 hours into another state to get here. And it was a skiddish ride due to inclement weather. 
Lol. Of course i didnt know or recognize a single dish on the buffet line. It all smelled tempting. But some of the sites were intimidating such as multiple fish dishes that still had their heads n tails on. I did not not opt to try any of these n neither did my filipino friend so no brainer there. 
I thoroughly enjoyed any dish that had pork in it. The roast pork was a hit with me. Grilled bbq chicken skewers went down well. The main fair was garlic rice and i loved that. Best rice i ever had. 
My favorite thing on buffet line was mini pork egg rolls. I ate at least 20 of them
For  dessert we had hola hola. A unique concoction of ice cream beans corn n shaved ice. Was pretty good
Service was great!!!
Was an awesome authentic experience but im pretty sure you have to be Filipino to get the best experience here. 
Im gonna stick to Tacos!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most people in Northeast Ohio only experience the awesomeness that is Filipino cuisine if they're lucky enough to have Filipino friends. Nipa Hut has been around for a long time to fix that, but a lot of people don't realize it's there. I went for a bit of shopping (the market has a trove of interesting specialized foods and imports) and lunch one Saturday. The all-you-can-eat buffet was well worth it, with tons of choices, including the \"greatest hits\" of this exceptional cuisine. Everyone is really nice there, too, and very proud of their offerings. It's a bit of a haul for me, but one I'll be making more often."}
{"text":"This is my Asian go to for home cooks. Convenient and good prices.  A great suburban option if you cant get downtown.  Plenty of variety for your kitchen pantry.  Never had their take out food but hear it's tasty."}
{"text":"A good filapino food store is a good thing to find and reasterant to boot. Oriental stores have a little of everything. this place is focused on the Philippine cusine. The wife is a filapina and loves the place and the food. Also live blue crabs when in season. Freindly and clean"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, ultra clean.  Excellent food, buffet is nice.  Store has all the best Filipino foodstuffs, even specialty ice-cream that's hard to find.  Most importantly, it's FRESH.  You can even order your lechon (whole pig) here and have it made for your parties.  Perfect pancit, adobo, menudo...
Also they sell the awesome, ultra strong \"my shaldan\" air fresheners!  Everyone's favorite Christmas gift (next to Pocky!)
Prices are good."}
{"text":"The buffet is great and the price is very reasonable. Very large selection. I come here to eat the Filipino food that I don't know how to make. I'm Filipino so this is the food my parents would cook when I was growing up. It reminds me of home.  

The grocery store also has all of the ingredients you would need to make any Filipino dish. I always make sure to pick up some mung bean hopia when I go there!"}
{"text":"I came here a month ago on a Saturday afternoon. The dining area is connected to a store. They have Red Horse beer which is cool. The buffet is a good deal for the cost. I think it was around 11 dollars. I tried a little bit of everything that was laid out and enjoyed it all. Filipino food is good. I don't know of any other Filipino restaurant in Cleveland so you may as well come out to Nipa Hut for their weekend buffet."}
{"text":"Nipa hut was one of the best places I ate my entire trip. We went on Saturday for the buffet and it was tops. I loved the adobo, pancit, dirty rice, and bikol. I would say you should eat here. Have a lumpia for me"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this grocery store gets a 4 star... Everything on the shelf is overpriced, outdated and looks crappy. There was this lunch meat can that says \"eat before May 17 2017\" and I was like dude, this is way outdated, are you expecting people to buy that? Plus it costs $5 meanwhile those Asian grocery stores downtown could just cost $2 and not outdated. Also the fresh vegetables (I was looking to buy some baby bok choi) aren't fresh with yellow, dried out leaves. I spent $10 on 2 bags of instant noodles, a lunch meat can and a bag of shrimp ball which was totally ridiculous. Additionally, obviously this place does not have the highest hygene standard. I will never go there again - please avoid this place."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I never eat Filipino food. 
I eat here. I like it. 
It also a grocery store where I can hoard up on my Filipino beers. I don't particularly like Pinoy beers but I do drink them when I'm in the Philippines so when I drink them here i feel it brings me closer to home."}
