{"text":"This is a great place for takeout wings. (I don't know if I would recommend dining in.) I love their sauce! Pretty reasonably priced for what you get. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Bitchy bartender and high prices! They couldn't pay me to come back! Rude and bad service!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my worst restaurant experiences ever and the food was good. If you don't smoke wear a respirator. This place is smoker friendly so if you don't smoke be prepared to gag. 
We all ordered the jumbo fish. They have a fish \"special\". Monster portion of fish, cole slaw, and your choice of fries or mac and cheese for $7.95. It's a Pittsburgh tradition to serve a piece of fish the size of three rivers stadium so I opted to skip the sides. I ordered the fish sandwich only. My co-workers ordered the special. 
My co-workers were charged $7.95 for the fish with two sides and I was charged $9.50  for just fish because I didn't order the \"special.\" The waitress said mine didn't include sides. Which universe does this make sense?  
My co-worker found a hair in his food. The waitress explained that no one there has black hair so it couldn't have come from the the kitchen. We must have planted it. No compensation offered. 
One waitress at lunchtime equals extremely slow service. 
They declined my Am/Ex card. Am/ex said it was operator error. Are you surprised?
I'll eat my own vomit before I'll go back to Mugshots."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars just because it's within walking distance. It's a smoking bar so you'll smell like an ashtray every time. Id tell you about the food, but the kitchen is never open...however I have been allowed to have pizza delivered there to eat and that's a big plus. The bar staff has changed over a few times the past few years and isn't nearly as good. Slow service & poorly made drinks (also priced like your at a very nice place in the city). Often the bar there is a sticky mess, the toilet over flowing, no drinks being served while the bartender sits on the cooler smoking and taking shots."}
{"text":"Great bar, great people. The service is excellent, especially bartenders Tiffany and Teenie.  

Bar food is well...bar food. Hot cheese balls & beer battered fries (I affectionately call crack fries) are my go to. Cold drafts, nightly drink specials.

A bit to much country music played for my taste.  Only down side for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last week for a drink after work. It was cute & clean. They offer a variety of craft beers, mainly in cans. The bartender was kind of rude in the fact that my husband had to ask 3 times for something before she even acknowledged him. She wasn't busy or talking to anyone, so he wasn't interrupting her. Our first round consisted of a shot of fireball, a corona and a Maui w sprite. It cost $16 which seemed over priced, especially for 1 oz shots. 

I don't know if we will return, but it's possible."}
{"text":"We ended up getting a great deal on Saturday.. 25 wings plus a pitcher of beer for $14. That's an awesome deal considering that its like $10 for 12 wings. We ordered the honey BBQ sauce as well as garlic parm.  The honey bbq were fabulous, loved the sauce. The garlic parm wings were okay, but not that great. Every time i've had garlic parm, they  were dipped in a garlic sauce & sprinkled with parm cheese. This wasn't really a sauce.. just a wing with chunks of minced garlic on them and no trace of parm cheese. Oh well.

The 2nd bartender Krista was a sweetie, but like JD mentioned in the tip section, the older blonde hair lady had a mean, bitter attitude for no reason at all. Its a normal bar and everyone seems like regulars. Smoking is permitted."}
{"text":"Barbie is probably one of the worst bartenders I've ever encountered. She has a major stick up her ass I witnessed her verbally complain about a tip another customer gave her. She charged me $11.50 for a double Bacardi and Coke . I pay less than that on the north shore during game time. I will never come back to this bar. I hope they go out of business. With this staff they just might."}
{"text":"This place is a nice neighborhood joint. We popped in for some lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Bar was reasonably busy with a handful of regulars at the bar. We grabbed a table next to the bar. The bartender was our server. I'm not sure of we had the bartender that others have said was not pleasant, but ours was nice to us. 
Menu was decent, with typical bar food. Food was good. I had a turkey club sandwich and fries. Big sandwich and fresh fries. Me likey!!! 
Honestly, my only complaint would be that they allow smoking. As a former smoker, going into a place that reeks of cigarettes makes me want to gag. People were chain smoking at the bar, so it just made it that much more worse. 
I would possibly go back, bc the food was yummy. May bring an oxygen mask though."}
{"text":"Inexpensive everything, from food to alcoholic beverages.  The wings ARE huge and always cooked perfectly - I prefer the \"mixed\" sauce, but they have 18 wet flavors and 7 dry rubs to suit anybody's taste.

The pepperoni rolls are BEST IN THE CITY, BAR NONE, with or without the delicious marinara sauce!!

And for the reviewer who complained about not being able to take home wings on wing night, it says right on the menu NO TAKEOUT.  Shame on you for rating them poorly on a policy which is very clearly stated.

They also have a DJ on Friday nights that plays a \"Name That Tune\" game which includes prizes and on Saturday nights, they have Karaoke Roulette, where you can either sing your own song, or put your friends name in for a song of YOUR choice.  

The bartenders are super attentive and knowledgable in their craft.  

Most of all, the regulars are as friendly as people get - come on in and make some new friends!!

I LOVE this place!!"}
