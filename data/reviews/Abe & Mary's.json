{"text":"The best salads in Canada.  I love the simplicity and healthiness of this place.  Their salad combinations are interesting and yummy.  And the service is very pleasant too.  Great place to stop for a casual bite of take out."}
{"text":"One of my fav place for a salad in montreal! The food is made in front of you so you know it's super fresh and they have the best desert of all time"}
{"text":"One of the best salad bars in the city make your own salad  !!!! Always fresh always good around 11 bucks great healthy Choice"}
{"text":"The \"Ronnie\" salad from their cafe is sooo good! (And it's huge!!) Will definitely come back for more. The smoothie was also super good."}
{"text":"For a quick fast food healthy spot I like to head over tk this gem. Everything is so fresh and healthy! And the staff are super nice plus you can do a little shopping while your there ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy smoothie or a quick salad to boost your mood! Read more about it on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/10/28/abe-marys-food-to-boost-your-mood/"}
{"text":"What a dump! The food is terrible. The service is awful. The clothes are worse.  This is a great place for people with deadened taste buds and color blindness."}
{"text":"So you thought you were going to a salad shop, did you? Well, think again, intrepid Yelpers. This place is SO extra that you need to see it to believe it.   You need to wear it to believe it. You need to pick up their over-sized plastic gun. You need to cuddle with their dozens of random stuffed animals in their dedicated plush toy room. And if you're me, you know you need to buy Lisa Sussman's 'The 100 Best Foreplay Tips Ever!'. Which, thankfully, can be found right across from the cash, next to a 'Wake me up for Sex' eye mask.   There must be over 300 tchotchkes, ashtrays, aprons, books, toys and even a bejewelled hand flipping you the bird - merchandised right in their window.  But despite all this (fun?) madness, the food is solid. The ingredients are fresh and of seemingly high quality. The lettuce wrap we ordered did just what it needed to do (except stay intact while being eaten) and one of our 3 smoothies was quite nice.   Trigger warning: Their 'Tastes Like Ice Cream' smoothie neither looks nor tastes like ice cream.   I wish there was a little more diversity among the staff relative to the clientele. When my privilege flares up I have a hard time swallowing."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is slow ... maybe they need to hire more employees .. the ambiance is wonderful"}
{"text":"Wow! Vraiment une belle place, spacieuse et moderne!! Tout est très blanc et épuré, il y a de la bouffe, des jus et smoothies. Le service n'est pas le meilleur, quand nous y etions il y avait pas mal de confusions entre les tables (qui a pris quoi? Est ce à votre table?! Etc..) A part ca, tout etait parfait, je vous recommande de l'essayer!!"}
{"text":"Located in an ugly, dumpy-looking building,in an ugly area of the city, this place boasts lots of \"exclusives\".  What it really boasts of is cheap-looking, made in China, street/club wear,with HIGH prices. Their top floor has been shut down for now, the outlet permanently closed, and their once impressive toiletries/perfume lines,gone the way of the dodo. They carry the famous English Molton Brown line, but the selection is sooo paltry, what's the point? The small café at the entrance wafts its onion/ tuna/vinegar aroma throughout the store. Elegant! MEH!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend comes from NY and came to Montreal for the weekend  ,just passing on by we decided to stop in and do some shopping . ran up a bill close to 2500. Before paying the bill the owner came in . We decided to ask her if possible she can give us a 10% discount for buying so much . The answer a flat NO normally I would  not take any of the clothes and walk out but we didn't because our initial intension was to buy without a discount ,still very dissapointed and my girlfriend will never go back .  On another note which I posted to Facebook  yesterday we walked into another retailer Intermix which had great things and they had this sign posted in the store spend 3000 and take 30%off and a scale for less spending . So we spent 3000 !"}
{"text":"If I were to be specific I would give this restaurant a 3.7. I throughly enjoyed my salad which was the A&M BLT with honey djon mustard sauce. There was an option to do the typical vinegar and oil. It was 15.50. What was interesting about the A&M BLT was that it came with chicken bacon, not pork bacon. It also came with grilled chicken, tomatoes, and cheese. Realistically, it wasn't that healthy but I enjoyed it. My friend who is an vegetarian opted for the OZ. She immediately regretted her decision. She was not a fan. I tried a bite and I thought it was rather bland. The cashier also recommended the OZ to us. For a salad place, they only have two vegetarian options. A lot of their salads only have one type of dressing - vinegar and oil."}
{"text":"I used to love this store, especially the outlet section upstairs, and have purchased dozens of items in the past.  However, I noticed that the prices started creeping up to the point that I can find the same deals elsewhere, with a larger selection and a better return policy.  As well, they used to have a really friendly, honest sales staff who you could always trust to tell you whether something looked good or bad, even if it meant that they couldn't make a sale. However, I've noticed that most of thee people no longer work there.   What bothered me the most was an experience similar to that of Kathryn, whose comment was moved to the \"not currently recommended section\".  Only once, I realized when I got home that the item(pair of shoes) was defective. I returned to the store, to be told \"sorry, we don't have another pair, goodbye\". No offer of a refund. When I asked for a refund, the manager told me that she would have to send the shoes to their head office for verification, although she acknowledged herself that the shoes were defective. Day after day, I called for follow up, only to be told\"Don't call us, we'll call you\". After a week, I contacted the head office myself; sure enough, the manager had never sent them the shoes or even spoken to them.  I was offered a credit note by head office, until I pointed out that Quebec Consumer Protection law calls for them to repair,replace or refund a defective item.  I did finally get my money back, and have since purchased items of more value than the credit note would have been, but the experience really soured me on the store.  I had the feeling that they  thought that if they ignored me long enough that I would drop the matter. Seems like bad business practice to do this to a regular client. As I said, I do go back from time to time, but buy a lot less than I used to."}
{"text":"The whole experience was not positive hence the 2 star review. Not to get into too much detail..... ordering did not go smoothly. Besides the unorganized wait time and other issues....and the fact they left out the avocado..... the salad was very boring. The whole experiences left me wanting Mandy's"}
{"text":"Food is decent ,,restaurant it self is ok, Seats are comfortable , portions are very small I ask for chicken wrap there was more veggies in the wrap then chicken I guess they are trying to lower the cost of the sandwich so they can have high profit, owner is extremely nice woman , but most importantly SERVICE IS EXTREMELY BUT EXTREMELY SLOOOWWWWW ."}
{"text":"Really nice place! I enjoyed their custom salads cheaper then Mandy's so that's a plus. They also have really great sandwiches and the boutique is really really nice. It gets really crowded during lunch. I feel like they can amp up the protein in their salads a bit more my grilled chicken was almost none existant. Other then that love the ambiance!"}
