{"text":"We ordered 6 wings and a large pizza for delivery and were charged $27.  This outrageous for one pizza and a side.  When the pizza came it was under cooked.  The pizza dough was completely stuck to the bottom of the box, because it was so under cooked.  I will not be ordering pizza from them again."}
{"text":"Falbo's is some of the best pizza, but the Verona location does not offer coupons like the Middleton and Madison locations. Sucks that we had to pay $4 more for the same pizza that the rest of Madison gets for less. What kind of business doesn't honor coupons from other locations?  This owner apparently has ZERO business sense  and doesn't care about customer retention."}
{"text":"Looks like I'm the one to spoil the party of 3-star or higher reviews.  Had to happen sometime...  I've been to Falbo's in Verona twice.  The first time, I got a thin crust pizza.  It was decent, better than Papa John's or Dominos, but nothing to call home about.  I wouldn't turn it down if a friend were ordering it, but am unlikely to go back for it myself as there are others in the area I prefer.  The second time, I got their deep-dish stuffed pizza, and had high hopes for it as ordinarily Chicago-style pizzas are amongst my favorites.  Sadly, this was not to be at Falbo's.  The overwhelming problem was the sauce was much too sweet.  On the thin crust pizza, this hadn't been that noticeable - the sauce was milder than I prefer, but not offensive.  Increase the amounts to what's on the stuffed pizza, and the sweetness became very evident and distracted from the rest of the pizza.  I could still finish it, but I would not get it again.  Much better to just get Uno if you're in Madison, or wait until your next trip to Chicagoland.  Overall, two stars.  You might like it if you prefer sweeter sauces, and the thin crust is worth trying if you don't have a go-to pizza place in Madison.  But skip it if you don't live here.  \"I've experienced better\" describes it fairly well."}
{"text":"Very happy with the quality of the food and service at Falbo's in Verona.  It is not the greatest location or decor but our son loves it.  Good place for kids and we enjoy the pizza."}
{"text":"Best, most consistent thin crust delivery pizza we have had.  We stick with the mediums, sometimes the larges aren't crispy enough in the middle, but that always happens with thin crust delivery pizza.  Toppings are great, and service has always been fast and friendly.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ordered a BLT b/c i just wasn't feeling pizza and it was pretty good. bacon was cooked well and there was a good amount of it. the \"L\" and \"T\" not super fresh but the bread was pretty good.  Had a big tv playing ESPN."}
{"text":"We went there once.  The chefs? were busy talking about something for quite a while.   They have the makings of some good pizza with some good dough and the regular toppings but our pizza was to go and when we got home we found it was uncooked in the center, the crust did not have the best flavor and it was burnt.  We plan to try Avanti's next time.  Falbo has come out in support of the protest as they are on a list of protest supporters.   I raise them one star and will give them another try. Thanks Falbos!!"}
