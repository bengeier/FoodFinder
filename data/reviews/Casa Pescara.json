{"text":"I have to agree with the comment on service. The staff does not know what service with a smile is. There was one waitress last night who obviously did not want to be there. We went as a group and did not feel appreciated. Food is alright, but nothing special. There are many better restaurants in Montreal that deliver on the promise of service and exceptional food. This restaurant misses the mark on both."}
{"text":"Terrible smell,Terrible food,Bad service waitress can't take orders in groups only goes one by one because they can not count.The owner is not flexible in accommodating clients with replacing a choice of food for people with allergies."}
{"text":"I used to love to go to this place.   Nice veal dishes,  excellent risotto.   However, lately while food is still good,   service is awful.  Staff which has changed for the worse seems to hang around people they know and ignore everyone else.  Too bad it used to be good"}
{"text":"Awesome family run restaurant. Go say hi to Elio and his son Sergio in the kitchen. Nice cosy atmosphere. They also do takeout."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real local secret. Open since 1965, the original owner and chef was still cooking in the kitchen on a Monday night at 10:00 when most restaurants were closed. So happy I found it. Amazing food, wonderful authentic Italian atmosphere and friendly, and well-timed  service in English, French or Italian!"}
{"text":"C'est un restaurant familiale d'un âge d'or, pas de musique, atmosphère trop calme et vielle décoration du temps d'elcapone, un conseil c juste les pâtes qui se mangent, n'essayez pas autre chose.  Merci"}
