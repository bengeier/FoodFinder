{"text":"I came here for lunch and was rather disappointed with both the service and the food.  We were a large party of 8, but the restaurant was not very busy and service was still slow. The waitress had to be asked multiple times to bring napkins, etc.. and didn't really check in. Even getting the check and getting out was slow.  The food took a long time to come out. I had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed. They were SO greasy and didn't have a ton of flavor. I got the \"bottom of the barrel\" fries, which did not impress either.  I wanted to like this place, but would not recommend it based on my experience."}
{"text":"Solid joint.  Beer is better than expected and almost as good as advertised.  Food is up to par, but most everything revolves around the beer, as it should.  Everyone owes this place at least one visit.   Hope to be back."}
{"text":"I would go back again for the decor, but not the food. I only tried their summer ale, which was served lukewarm, so I can't speak much for their beer.  For appetizers, we got the traditional pierogies, untraditional pierogies, and the bruschetta. This was my first time trying pierogies, so maybe I'm just not a pierogie fan, but I thought they were unremarkable. I enjoyed the bruschetta and would get it again.   My table also shared a few pizzas - pepperoni, chicken & sundried tomatoes, and the cinco fromaggio. These are way overpriced for the quality, although they are really large pizzas. I would NOT recommend the cinco fromaggio, unless you're craving a thick layer of salty cheese with an overpowering garlic taste. The chicken & sundried tomato pizza was okay, but I wouldn't pay to eat it again. I liked the pepperoni the best - maybe the simpler pizzas are better here.  Overall, I'd recommend this place - it's a cool place to check out despite the average food. If I were to go back, I'd try their veggie pasta, more of their apps, and the beer sampler."}
{"text":"Did the flight, fantastic beers. The place is just awesome in my opinion, cool scenery and I like the feel. Service was a little slow but this was after the ND / Pitt game so it was packed, which may be the reason. Food was good, but I ordered off the bar menu."}
{"text":"This is somewhere you go once.  It's awesome that they've turned a church into a brewery. Throwing the kettles onto the altar: perfect. The beer itself is pretty decent; I'm a fan of the Pious Monk Dunkel especially.  The food is good, but not stellar. The biggest problem is that the menu that they had the last time I went (last month) is *the exact same menu they had when they opened.* Everything on there is good, but nothing on there will blow you away--and after you've been there a couple times and it's the same menu over and over again, you realize that this business is trading on the novelty factor, not making any effort to actually be a real restaurant. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't comment on the beer.    Great conversational location with its being located in a church.  Really neat place to take someone from out of town.  I've never had anything other than their brick oven pizzas, which are excellent with the combinations available.  I also love the hot Gouda cheese dip with pita bread appetizer."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place as its a Pittsburgh legend as far as restaurants go.  I wans't necessarily let down, but I can't see what all the type was about.  The beer was good.  We got one German style beer and one American style brew with 3 types of hops.  Both were great.  We split the tuna appetizer (4 stars) and the black bean soup with cilantro sour cream (4 stars) and a salmon salad (4 stars).   So why three stars?  Over priced for what you get - luckily we were not too hungry our we would have left craving more.  Also, the service was so so at best and the food took more time than usual.   I didn't really like the environment of the outdoor seating either.   Overall, I would return but have mixed feelings about the reputation this place has been able to build for itself."}
{"text":"Great beer, bar tenders and atmosphere, food is decent but not the reason to go.  Very cool space, not ideal for anyone hard of hearing or a low talker.  I'd go back..."}
{"text":"visiting the area from Oregon and this was on the \"if we have time\" list. We were very glad that we made the time. I wasn't sure what to expect but as soon as I walked in my breath was taken away. Growing up Catholic I have been in several churches but not one this old and with an operating brewery inside. It was very impressive! Unfortunately we had already eaten so we just had some beer and took lots of pictures. The staff was very nice and the beer was good too! I would have loved to take a tour to see what they were using the surrounding buildings for. good for you that you saved this old church from demolition and turned it into a fun place without losing the old time feel!!"}
{"text":"What a unique dining experience!!! This place gets 4 stars without even factoring in the food. Add in the cuisine, and it becomes a favorite.   In a city where the weather sucks ass half the year, its important for a place to have an inviting environment. Plus I'm a hardcore Cleveland Browns fan, and its always difficult to find a Pittsburgh location not completely saturated with Steeler shit and I.C. Light. Quite the turnoff!!! Its great to see that the Burgh has some class.   I was only here one time, yet it left a lasting impression. The church is gorgeous. I really appreciate the European mentality: saving the old building and keeping originality while updating and transforming the facility during restoration.   My friend and I split 2 wood fire pizzas. The Artichoke, Spinach, and Feta includes red onion, tomatoes, and parm as well. The Pittsburgh Pierogie blends potato puree, sauteed onions, garlic, and cheddar. Both pies had amazing flavor regardless of the fact that they used minimal amounts of each ingredient. The house brews were excellent too, as if that was ever a question!   I despise the usual Pittsburgh atmosphere, but the Church Brew plays redeemer and keeps me excited for my next visit."}
{"text":"Beautiful former Catholic Church with great architecture and stained glass, service was great, food delicious and fun - a must stop!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best beer in the burgh (though the sharp edge's selection really can't be touched). The pizzas are great (better when they had the southwest).  They'd get all 5 stars if they brought back the southwest pizza. the managers and staff are really cool people too. My wife and I became regulars for a time there and got to know a lot of them.  The desserts are really good too!"}
{"text":"Love the beer here, but the food can be hit-and-miss. In general, I recommend the pierogis and the battered corn dogs. The pizza is ok and I've had many a wilted salad here. The location is really what draws people here though. It's a gorgeous building and I love sitting outside in the garden courtyard. However, as beautiful as it is inside, I think they completely ruin the atmosphere with overly harsh lighting. I feel like I'm in a cafeteria, not a bar/restaurant. It would be so much lovelier if they had softer lighting and more candles in the tables, etc."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is excellent in this old church.  Service has been good both times I have been here.  Food is very good, sandwiches and burger both stand out.  Beer is good as well.  Not a big selection like other breweries, but what is on offer is usually very good."}
{"text":"Beer was delicious. Tried the Celestial Gold and the Pale Ale, would definitely come back and drink these and try the others. It's really a very special setting with the old church, cooler than any beer venue I've been in before.  The three stars is for the food. My friend and I split the artichoke pizza which took about 45 minutes to arrive. Once it was finally brought over we were told that they only have one pizza oven, and since a lot of people had ordered pizzas that night it took extra long. Okay, so why not just tell people \"hey we only have one pizza oven so your pizza will take a while, is that cool or do you want to order something else?\". And then parts of the dough were still dough-y and undercooked. The rest was fine and I do love me some artichoke, but it was one of the more disappointing meals I've had in a while."}
{"text":"This is a classic destination for out-of-towners and anyone who lives in Pittsburgh who needs to entertain guests, but it's worth a drive even if you're just having a local dinner. I love that they have a pierogie of the day, although I confess I've never tried those. They have a varied menu that's executed surprisingly well for a place with so much potential gimmick. The one bummer is the long wait on Friday and Saturday nights. If you show up without a reservation, don't be surprised if you have to wait 30 minutes or more to be seated, despite how cavernous this place looks.  The food is a bit expensive by Pittsburgh standards, I guess. Thankfully I'm now immune to that, as I earn my salary outside of western Pennsylvania... so I look forward to coming back and indulging at Church Brew Works =P"}
{"text":"Beer is just ok as is the food, but the atmosphere is cool (which is the reason I go). I recently moved to Pittsburgh so my out of town friends who are visiting for the first time always want to go to Church Brew Works because it's so unique. I'll continue to bring people, but warn them that we're going for the cool pictures and tongue-in-cheek humor, not the cuisine."}
{"text":"Just ate at Church Brew Works. Very pleased! The atmosphere is wonderful. They preserved the original church as much as possible. Stained glass windows, pews, ceiling, lights, floor. Amazing! The food was great!  I had the pirogies with cream sauce, broccoli, and tomatoes. Everything was perfect. Normally I would think the broccoli was over cooked but it was exactly as it should be in that meal. Also the tomatoes were not cooked but added at the end warming them and not letting them turn to mush. Perfect.  The staff was friendly, personable and helpful Looking  forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do.  That's part of the reason we go back, that and the friendly staff.   It is a great setting, I love the concept and I am convinced that they are on the edge of really having something special.  However, at the end of the day the food is letting down what has the potential to be an awesome overall experience.  Tonight I had the meatloaf.  I'm not a big fan of meat loaf, but as is one of their signature dishes so I thought I'd try it.  Ugkh!  The entire meal was incredibly salty, way over salty.  I mean borderline inedible.  The meatloaf itself was dry and not appealing and the rest of the plate just went down hill from there.   My wife had the Salmon.  Salmon is usually a pretty safe dish, but in this case it was again, a little dry and just not appetizing.   However, the it came with similar sides to the meatloaf and bam there goes the saltiness again.  Our three kids had three different meals, hard to screw up pasta or perogies or pizza.  Well you would think, except the pizza arrived a good 5 minutes after the other meals, was overcooked and again heavily salted.    All in all we want to like this place.  The staff are always friendly, as they were again tonight, and I'll admit to having a soft spot for their Celestial Gold, but we may have to take a break for a while.  Been stung once too often lately to be going back anytime soon.  I really hope that they sort out their food."}
{"text":"The ambiance is perfect... The concept is amazing... However the downside is the not-so-spectacular fusion of flavors in the food. I ordered the buffalo meatloaf which tasted bland and the side vegetables tasted weird and overcooked. The wild boar pizza had no extra kick and isn't extraordinary. The sandwhiches such as yinkasa cheese stake was surprisingly excellent. All in all we had fun dining in this place but perhaps attention to more diligent food flavors is called for."}
{"text":"Lots of beer selection and decent food. I had the bison meatloaf and it was probably the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. My husband had the bison burger and my friend had the bison pizza. They were both very satisfied with their meals. The only criticism I have is that my food was lukewarm when it came out, but it was still very tasty. We also loved the atmosphere. W will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I lived in Pittsburgh! Great atmosphere, and great vegan options! Here are some of my favorites:  Appetizers (Starters): - Hummus with flatbread  Side: - Sweet potato fries with chipotle ketchup  Entrees: - Crispy vegan polenta with roasted tomato sauce - Garden plum tomato pizza (made without cheese) - Artichoke, Spinach, and (no feta--sometimes they substitute portabella mushrooms for no extra charge)  The only cons were the noise (the restaurant is a huge open building with no wall barriers for breakup of sound) and the big crowds on the weekend nights (there is usually a 40 minute wait or so)."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is one giant dupe. You walk in and it looks like an old church, of course. But you sit down, and it sounds like a rec center. Smells like a zoo. Kinda feels like it's still a church and you're just visiting for a church dinner. The beer brewing machinery is definitely just for show. Ordered the rattlesnake pierogis and got what looked like giant eagle potstickers. All food was room temp. I think this place might be Hoss's under a different name. Glasses were dirty, and our server lied to us multiple times. When will the duping and lies stop? Went to look in the kitchen and it was just one big buffet.  Food was just OK that's why I gave 3 stars. Wasn't the worst church food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Very cool ambiance! And tasty beer. No pee on toilet seats. What else matters?"}
{"text":"Its an Interesting location. The food was quite average. the service was good and friendly. They also had their own brew. I tried the sampler and I thought the stout sucked.  Its an ok place."}
{"text":"Always seem to come back here, when in in town for more good tasty beverages and very tasty meal to go with it."}
{"text":"This is the most unique brewpub I've ever seen.  I mean, it's a church with a brew house where the altar used to be.  Wow.  To say that it feels borderline transgressive is putting it mildly.  But then you remember monks have been making beer for centuries and any guilt transubstantiates to awesome.  Because the room is really cool and the beer quite simply rocks.    I decided to order a flight and it's one of the best decisions I've made in a church.  I'd enjoyed the Dunkel the night before at Fridays at The Frick, so I knew I'd like it in all its malty German goodness, but the other beers did not disappoint.  The table favorites were Pipe Organ Pale, the Porter, the Strong Ale and the Mad Mardigan's, with its spicy black malt.  Yum.  Oh, it's pretty loud, the food is decent (good lamb meatballs and hummus) and as others have said, the service could use a little improvement."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. We always bring out of town guests and they always love it.  Last night we had a special experience there. We went for their Oktoberfest Brewers Dinner, a five-course dinner with paired beers. It was wonderful. All of the courses were delicious and the beers were a good match. They started it off with an off-menu pumpkin stout. You could drink it all night it was so good. But, it was just the start. There was definitely a lot of beer to be drunk, pun intended. They also included some of their souvenir glasses at the end.  Sitting down with us was one of the brewers, Justin Viale. Justin was a lot of fun to be with and his sharing of his brewing knowledge and CBW experience added to the evening. The chef, Joe Kiefer, came out with each course to explain it. Great job, Joe.  Finally, we learned these special dinners are put on every other month. We thought this was an Oktobefest only event. We'll be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Two stars because I appreciate someone stepping up to the plate and saving this old architectural gem of a Catholic church from the wrecking ball, even if it does mean there's a giant beer brewing apparatus on what used to be the altar.  One star because the beer I had - their \"black\" holiday brew - was very good, spicy and just the way I like it, and furthermore they had it available AFTER Christmas at a time when many brewpubs (if they bother to be open) will tell you they sold out of their Christmas beers before the holiday even arrived.  This place is also nice and big, probably about three times the size of many other brewpubs we've hit up, so there was no wait for a table for early dinner.   They do ask whether you want to be on the \"bar side\" or the \"restaurant side\"  (the sides are divided by what used to be the main center aisle of the church) without telling you the difference between the two, so I still don't really know what it is except the bar side has a bar and a TV.  Other than that they look alike.  Food choices were rather more meh than I was hoping for, though.  This place specializes in pierogis.  I don't know when pierogis got all trendy, but I grew up in Cleveland, they have been around for decades, and I don't get particularly excited by putting different fillings in them.  Apparently the Church does.  Whatever, I don't care.  They also serve pizza, sandwiches, burgers, nothing too interesting.  Given that I work near Philly, the last thing I want is a cheesesteak made in Pittsburgh.  I ended up ordering a big bowl of the beer cheese soup and wishing they had a more interesting menu.    Our waiter and the overall beer selection were the two weak points of this place.  It only has about 10 beers on the menu.  I was pleasantly excited and surprised when the waiter told me they had all the beers but one, as I'm more used to this and that being  \"out, sorry\" especially during busy holiday weeks.  I did find one good beer to drink, but I tend to like beer samplers with a few small glasses of different beers,  or at least buying one glass each of two different beers per visit.  I didn't see anything on the menu in the line of a sampler; it may be I missed it, or perhaps it wasn't being offered when we were there, but since I see someone below mentioning one, I'm kind of wondering why I didn't see it and why our waiter didn't mention it.  Furthermore, when I tried to order a second beer that was not too hoppy and not a stout, I found that of the three (3) choices I had in mind, all were available only in large size bottles, i.e. not available by the glass but only in a large size meant for people to share.  The large sizes were too much for just me to drink given that I'd already had a pint.  I'm looking over to a bar stretching most of the length of a large church and wonder what is the problem that it can't have more taps flowing and more beers to select from by the glass rather than by the huge bottle?  Very much a bummer.  Also, after the guy brought initial beers and took our order  - a meal that included a small cup of soup for my companion, and just a large bowl of soup for me - Mr. Waiter didn't think to ask me if I wanted my soup now or wait till the \"entree\" (i.e. my companion's burger) was brought out.  I generally need to eat something with my beer (that I already had), and I was hungry.  The guy brought the little cup of soup to my dinner partner, brought me nothing, and then disappeared for like 20 minutes or more leaving me with nothing to eat but a couple slices of bread from the basket.  I couldn't get his attention to bring my soup because he literally did NOT emerge into view for that whole time!  The restaurant wasn't anywhere near full or busy and there seemed to be several wait staff around so I don't know what the deal was.  There was also some weird manager type in shirt and tie standing in the aisle giving the wait staff dirty looks the whole time we were there.    Summary:  Atmosphere and decor A, beer quality A,  beer selection B- , food selection B, waiter C- .   I'd go again, but next time I'll sit on the bar side and see if it's any better over there."}
{"text":"So good! Great food, beer, and atmosphere. The wild boar quesadilla was amazing...I wanted more! We also ordered the beer sampler. It gives you enough to try all the beers and share. The building is beautiful. It's a great space and all the brewing equipment is right in the main area.  Lots to see. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 5 times, over the course of 7 years or so.  I love the concept, design, and atmosphere of this place. I love that they've re-purposed a \"de-commissioned\" church. I love the beers they make. Their staff, also, have consistently been great.  My issue is with the food prices. I cannot believe the outrageous prices they charge for the food, considering the type of food it is (mostly high-carb, basic comfort food and bar food) and the quality of it (just OK). Seems very mismatched, considering the quality and the genre of food. But, maybe you will disagree with me-- see if you can check for their menu and prices online before you go, if you are concerned about spending carefully (many people are, these days).  Definitely give this place a try-- the experience of being there is great, it makes for a unique evening (although noise is a problem for conversationalists, on nights when they happen to be crowded) and if you enjoy beer, those are certainly worth tasting. But if you're watching your money, consider eating at home before going here, and just going for drinks or for something small to eat and seeing friends. The food is not the draw, here-- at least it definitely was not the draw for me. In my world, bar food should be priced like bar food."}
{"text":"For a place known for its beer, the food is shockingly amazing"}
{"text":"EXPECTED BETTER -My wife called in earlier this week to make reservations for today, Valentines Day.  Seeing we were coming for lunch around 1:30PM the lady she spoke to said there would be no need for reservations and it might start to get busy around 3:00PM due to the game end. We got there at 2:00PM and were immediately seated in the back and around 3:00 it started to fill (she hit it on the nose), the noise level was moderate. We started we Lobster Bisque and Beer Steamed Mussels. The bisque was good with plenty of tender lobster, no your traditional tomato base. The mussels were cooked beautifully, but the beer broth made the bitter to the point we could not enjoy the bread for dipping.   My wife had the Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes for her entree and I had scallops with Risotto. The Filet was cooked perfectly, MR with asparagus and roasted pepper on potatoes. The mash was cold!  Unfortunately, the Scallops and Risotto was not cooked correct.  Let me start as I would have sent these back but due to being Valentine my wife dislikes when I have to point out problems.  The Scallops were raw and wound up eat the outside edge of two and took home to cook, only cooked on one side.  The Risotto was over cooked and dry not at all creamy as you would expect, as if it were cooked earlier in the day and sitting in a pot waiting to be served. I guess no one was checking the food before it goes out to be sure all the plates are done right"}
{"text":"For my money, this is the best place to have a beer in Pittsburgh.*  It's a desacramentalized** Catholic church that was shut down during a reorganization period in Pittsburgh's religious history, due to the overall shrinking of the population.  Beer has replaced the sacramental wine and the crucified savior has been replaced with a beer vessel for an altar, but the spiritual feeling remains and the irony of the term vessel is imbued...or I could just be getting a buzz.  Either way, this is an awesome atmosphere to have a drink with a bunch of friends.  And the beer...some is better than others. One of the IPAs was way too grassy-tasting, but I thought the Thunderhead was just about right.  The Belgian Trippel was refreshing, but it didn't have enough bite for me.  I had a sip of every beer they offered, and while none were bad at all, I wasn't blown away.  At the same time, the prices aren't bad, especially for a pint.  If the beer was better, this place would be five stars.    * I didn't eat the food, so I'm totally unqualified to rate it ** I just wanted to use that word in a sentence"}
{"text":"Walk in and be AMAZED  It is unbelievably what they did to preserve this church and still allow you to feel like you are in the COOLEST BAR AND RESTAURANT Great place to bring friends who come to visit from out of town"}
{"text":"I just visited the Church Brew Works for the first time over the holidays after passing it many times in the city and being intrigued with the beautiful building.    The interior definitely did not disappoint!  The sanctuary is gorgeous, with stained glass windows, gothic architecture, and old pews scattered throughout.  I would say the ambiance and beer were 4 stars and the food was probably a 3.5.  (I tried their holiday beer, which was a dark french beer and was quite tasty.)  The appetizer selection was extensive and I really enjoyed the smoked gouda/feta/spinach dip.  This place is also known for their pizzas, so I'd recommend skipping the rest of the entrees and just going for that.  I got their famous pierogie pizza, which was good, but needed an extra kick...like onions or olives, perhaps.  Overall, it's worth the experience and if you need a place for a large group, I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place holds a special place in my food-loving heart. As two people who love irony, my husband and I thought after eloping in Allegheny County Night Court, there would be no better place to have a \"reception\" than a church converted into a brewery. It's a cool space and worth a visit, though it is packed on weekend evenings.  My favorite on the dinner menu -- chicken pot pie! I love that it's not thick and goopy and that the topper is puff pastry and not traditional pie crust. On the pub menu -- LOVE the Southwest Chicken Wrap and traditional pierogies. Husband is a fan of the salmon.   I am giving it a 4 because the service has never been stellar -- typically if you're not sitting at the bar, you have to ask for the pub menu, which has pizza and sandwich options. I don't really get that -- because it's pretty much the old center aisle of the church that divides the bar side from the \"dining room\". But I have gotten a surly hostess (same one) on two occasions. No real greeting, no eye contact. So yeah, if you can get past that, the food is always spot on and tasty in my experience.  Oh! And the smell, it is distinctive. It doesn't bother me -- however, if you're turned off by woody, earthy smells -- you might want to skip.  Hehe, update -- another Yelper read this review and messages me that they actually changed their menu several months ago and don't have Chicken Pot Pie. Bummer to hear, but please note -- I was there 3-4 days before I wrote that review, I went there specifically for it and I didn't bother checking the menu. Our server simply  told me \"they didn't have that tonight\". Wish I would have known they don't have it ever!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my experience and will not be back. It took over an hour for appetizers and they were missing components and the soup I ordered was missing. The manager did not apologize for how long the food took and said my soup was still cooking. Service the entire time was extremely slow. The bartender never checked back on us to ask how our food was or to refill our waters. We asked for the check and it took 20 minutes to get our check. And I never did receive my soup. I just cancelled it. Never will be back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome (well except for the fact that smoking is allowed in Pittsburgh).  Felt very much like it should be in Seattle.  The stained glass and gothicness very much made this place quite sweet!  was kind of a long walk from downtown but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle so I know good beer and Church Brew Works has great beer. Food was really good too and the atmosphere is aweseome."}
{"text":"I have many friends who love this place, and many who absolutely hate it. I am somewhere in the middle.   I really like the pizza.  It is made in a brick oven, and apparently they can only make one at a time, so be prepared to wait if you order one.  I'm also a fan of the spinach dip, hummus, and pierogies. The entrees are a bit too pricy for what you get, so I'd probably steer clear of those and get the bar menu.   I don't drink a lot of microbrews, but I have enjoyed the specialty cocktails. In the fall and winter, I highly recommend the hot cider with spiced rum.   The service here is generally not very good. It is pretty slow and sporadic, especially if you go with a big group.  The most annoying and inconsistent thing about going to the Church is how they handle reservations. They used to take them, but apparently now they don't. Sometimes they will take a \"call ahead,\" which is essentially a reservation, and sometimes they won't.  Sometimes they require your whole party to be there before they will seat you; other times they don't. I wish they would figure out how to deal with this seemingly easy task."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, and very unique atmosphere! The high ceilings and stain glass windows are unlike anything else you'd find at a different brewery. Highly recommend the Banh Mi sandwich, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Everything I have had there has been wonderful. It helps that the building itself is really awesome as well."}
{"text":"Egads the beer is overdone and not consistent. That is of course a picky statement as I expect much more from a craft brewer. The atmosphere cannot be beat, though. This is a must to visit when you come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"+ unique setting, + great brews, + tasty pub food, - noisy  When Catholic Church sold one of their properties in Bloomfield they probably weren't aware that a real good micro-brewery would open its doors in their beautiful church. With the 'Church Brew Works' opening Pittsburgh gained not only a unique pub but also a great eatery.  I really encourage my followers to try their pierogi (Polish dumplings stuffed with potatoes and cream cheese or other fillings)!  Besides, the variety of beers is impressive and overall great. I had the 'Pius Monk Dunkel', which wasn't strong at all but malty and light.  Inside it is quite noisy but you can escape the crowds by choosing a table outside in the former backyard.  + unique setting + great brews + tasty pub food - noisy  Average price for an entrée: $18"}
{"text":"Used to be regulars. Loved the pizza. Liked the beer. Loved the ambience. The kitchen food has never been anything to go out of your way for. After an oven fire, they've been telling us for 2.5 years that the pizza oven will be back up 'soon' but never gives a timeframe. At this point we've given up on returning. The pizza was their bread and butter. I cannot imagine how much business they've lost, outside of us and everyone else we know.  Shame."}
{"text":"Sorry, Church Brew, I'm just not that impressed.  You have the potential to be a seriously hip place, but you're just not there yet.  First off, I know you were a church at one point, but what's with the lingering old-lady-smell?  Not very appetizing...  Second, what's with the tattered menus?  I was kind of grossed out just touching the menu--it was old, stained and falling apart.  Unfortunately, it kind of made the contents look unappetizing, too.  Third, the beer was pretty tasty, but served lukewarm!  The sweet potato fries were served cold and limp!  The service was okay, but felt kind of like Applebee's service--not service you'd expect to find at a Pittsburgh \"establishment.\"    Step it up, Grandma."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, awesome atmosphere (what else could you expect from an old church?).  There are two menus, one for the bar and another for the restaurant, and both are stellar. There is a variety of beer that pair well with the food, and while it can get a little pricey, it's worth it once in in a while for a great night out."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is great if you're an out-of-towner or are a Pittsburgh taking an out-of-towner out for a night. It's very cool inside, as you can probably tell from the pictures. it really is quite a stunning thing to see, but man...that's where it ends.  The whole place smells bad. I don't know of what - but every time I come here, it smells gross. Like an old wash rag or something. Just unclean. The food is nothing special. It's typical middle-of-the-road bar food, if that. Beer selection is fine. I like beer, but I also enjoy a good atmosphere, and Church doesn't give that to me.   Aside from the cool views inside, this place is nothing stellar. Wouldn't be upset to never come here again."}
{"text":"The beer is pretty good, definitely worth trying.  They have some styles that I have not seen elsewhere like a grisette and a dunkel - both very good.  The food menu is actually very impressive, but the execution is lacking.  Someone had the idea for these great menu items but lacks the passion or training to really impress.  It's great bar food, which is good because you will likely be drinking!"}
{"text":"We have gone twice.  The first time we actually got a table after waiting almost an hour.  The food was OK as long as you stick to burgers and pizza.  The beer was pretty good though.  The cons were the service.  Once we actually got sat, the wait staff was very inattentive.  The second time we went we were told that they don't accept reservations on weekend nights.  We couldn't even sit at the bar it was that crowded.  And they told us an hour and a half wait.  For decent beer and OK food, totally not worth it."}
{"text":"As most people say, the decor is great. The beers are also very good, and don't forget to check for special brews. Unfortunately, the food is quite a step below the quality of the beer and the (amazing) surroundings. It's not that it's bad, just lackluster. Other folks have praised their fries, but I'm guessing they haven't been to Eleven, where the fries are amazing: actually hot, crisp and delicious - and I think they are cheaper too!  So, come, snap some photos, drink some beer then eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been away from the miserable place called Pittsburgh for a while in hopes that the new micro breweries would have great selection and great beers, however it was the same old spot (The Church Brew Works) that came through. Coffee Porter and Sour Date beers have been maybe the best two beers I've had in a long time. Being from Pittsburgh and living in Charlotte/Asheville (Beer Cities) these two brews are incredible. This place continues to take the cake even after 4-5 years of time for the little guys to make some noise! Cheers to you The Church Brew Works"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh beer from knowledgeable staff including a rotating stout and amazing pierogies, who could want more. The atmosphere and decor are fantastic."}
{"text":"I have never understood why people are so into this place.  Maybe it used to be better when it was new?  It's basically a giant tourist trap now, or maybe a beer-themed amusement park.  The food is tolerable, though overpriced. The beer is nothing to write home about. The service is deplorable. Once you get over the truly awe-inspiring sight of an altar devoted to beer-making, and the sheer monstrous scale of the place, you're in a cavernous barn with several hundred of your closest friends (not to mention a pair of roving musicians---think German-style mariachis).  This place is *loud*.  The restoration of the sanctuary is beautiful, and the placement of the brewing equipment on the former altar is an inspired choice, but that and ten bucks should get you a burger and a good beer at Tessaro's up the road---so try that instead.  (By the way, while a few previous reviewers have mentioned that smoking is allowed in the restaurant, PA recently (9/08) banned smoking in most public places, including restaurants.  CBW is now non-smoking.)"}
{"text":"About the only way I would step into a church.......to have another drink and eat at the Chruch Brew Works!  If you are in the Pittsburgh area you definitely have to check out the Church Brew Works. It is a beautiful restaurant. It is a redesigned church and they still use parts of the pews and kept some of the decorations. The best part is they replaced the alter with the brewery!   The food and beer was very good. I had the very large Cuban sandwich and it was one of the better cubans I have had outside of Key West. My friends had the bison burger which received rave reviews as well. Since it was a brewery I had to have the sampler. I was impressed with most of the beers. If all you like is commercial crap beer like Miller Lite or Budweiser, don't bother. Many of the beers are strong flavored. My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mint Stoudt.   The waiter was bad, and a bit arrogant, but the food was good enough that he did not ruin the score.   If church served beer and food like this every Sunday, I would have to find Jebus!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food but the beer is great. Huge space, unique. Deserves more stars then it has"}
{"text":"We've stopped here on every trip to Pittsburgh. As a former Catholic school girl, it's kind of a kick to have dinner and beer in what was once a church...and when the sun streams in through the stained glass windows, it's just beautiful. As a vegetarian, I have always found plenty of choices on the menu. Just today had the mushroom. and lentil fritters appetizer, and shared a pierogi pizza and salad for the main meal. Washed it down with a Christmas ale. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I came in with a work group on a Tues night. The staff admitted that they were unusually busy, but to me, it looked like a normal-sized crowd for a large restaurant. Granted, I'm from NYC.  Anyway, they told us it would be a 45min wait for a table. 10min later, a table opened up, but the hostess didn't tell us. We just went and sat ourselves.  I went to tell a server and the hostess we were seated; they said they'll get to us when they can. Perhaps 30min later, the server arrived and took our orders. Drinks showed up 30min afterward, and then food came 45min afteward-- and the food orders were wrong. Some items were missing.  Now, for the food: it was crap. It was horrible, really, considering the location and the hype and the wait. Essentially, the chefs here go for the \"just use tons of fat, sugar, and salt\" style of American cooking.  Overall, it was a terrible experience, from the wait to the service to the food."}
{"text":"Compared to five years ago before I left Pittsburgh and this place was decent, this place has gone downhill big time.  The service was poor and the food was not good.  For instance, we got some type of spinach and artichoke dip and it was very watery.  We asked to return it and they would not let us, nor did they find a problem with the quality of the food.  I would not recommend spending the money to eat here."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Pittsburgh we stopped by church Street brewery and I was blown away by the decor. Been to dozens of breweries but the space was so different but interesting. Our bar tender Danni was nice, had a very appealing face and was very generous with her coasters."}
{"text":"The beer is good and I didn't try the food. But this place has a distinct musty smell. I can't seem to get beyond it. I'm sure it is from the brewing that is happening here but this place smells."}
{"text":"This is an old church that was turned into a brewery.  I think people mostly go here to drink beer, but since we don't drink, we like to go here for the cool atmosphere & their pizza is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Once we got over the fact that we were in a church-turned-brewery... the whole gimmick faded and we realized that this was a pretty sub-par restaurant.  First off, this two star rating is due to the food and service. I hesitated giving it a 3-star because the beers were pretty good. But we're in Pittsburgh and by default, good beers are expected.  - The waiter our group got was seriously one of the worst waiters I have ever gotten. The moment we sat down, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink in a tone of \"I do not want to be here.\" We asked if he could have a moment to look at the menu because it was our first time and asked for one more menu. He walked over to a table with a cute couple and took the menu right off their table and gave it to me without asking the other couple if they were done with it. He then stormed off and didn't come back till way later. When we were ordering food, he gave us attitude for everything and was extremely rude. My friend asked a question and he answered with a sarcastic remark and walked to the next person, never bothering to actually wait or answer the question honestly. When we got our checks, he threw them onto our table. I was extremely annoyed by his attitude towards us, which started before we even spoke to him. I understand that you have bad days and just don't want to deal with anyone, but that is no way to act to someone who is trying their best not to anger you and now completely confused as to why you are treating them like crap. Anywho... rant over. Bleh.  - The pizza was alright. A little dry and not super unique. I felt like it was missing something in flavor. The portions were huge, however.  - I got two beers, the Rotating Stout (which is actually a light beer brewed with coffee and chocolate) and the Dunkel. The Rotating Stout was certainly unique, it didn't have the heavy, silky finish of real stouts, but had it's own unique, refreshing tart with aftertastes of coffee. The Dunkel was smooth and not super strong, again, a good beer to drink. Both beers were great and decently priced, but I would not come back just for the beers when there are other great beer places in Pittsburgh.  The only reason why I would come back is if I had run out of things to show visiting friends or they saw this on a flyer and HAD to see it. Otherwise, there are so many other unique, amazing things in Pittsburgh that I would love to show friends and family.  So luckily, I was in good company because the experience here would've been absolutely miserable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, in part because their tongue in cheek approach to setting up the restaurant.  It is a brew pub inside of an old church.  The confessional is behind the bar and the brewing equipment is on the alter.    However, the quality of the food is what brings me back.  Last time I went, I had the pulled pork.  Wow, the sandwich was huge and quite yummy!  I had a side of sweet potato fries, which were decent.  They have a pretty decent sized wine list and obviously a number of microbrews on tap.    Our waitress was quite attentive, checking in with us regularly and providing refills of water without prompting.  It was quite busy but being a Saturday night, that was not surprising.  Expect to wait a little bit for a table.... you'll enjoy it once you do sit down!"}
{"text":"Great staff, nice selection of beer and great food! They also stock wine & liquor. Very cool atmosphere. An old church built in 1906, how can you go wrong? Seven of us were seated in no time without a reservation. They have a small store with shirts & Church stuff and they also sell mini-kegs & growlers to-go. I would definitely stop back on my next visit."}
{"text":"It's a tourist trap lets be honest. A cool idea having a bar in a church. They brew their own beer which is good and they have creative interpretations of some ordinary dishes but my two experiences here have been horrible.  First thing, this is a microbrewery so when you say you have Jesus brew, ( I made that up) on tap don't be shocked when I dont know what it is. Maybe offer a sample, instead of offering a $20 beer tasting tray.  I asked for a hefeweizen type beer and I ended up getting something that was close to a yuengling   The food was decent but it's really expensive for what it is. The place gets very loud and the seating is cramped.  Overall if you are a tourist this is the place to go. Over priced, average food, but u get to take pictures and tell all of your friends that you were there. My advice go there, take pictures and leave"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere, service and beer was excellent, the German food for the Oktoberfest was not good."}
{"text":"Just came here on a whim, the beer selection was down to 4. Didn't order any food except sampled the pierogies (original) the flavor was bland with the toppings exceeding the flavor. However the staff was warm and welcoming and fast. Seems like a great place to congregate with a bunch of friends. Definitely a place to check out even for its history! Cheers!"}
{"text":"$150 bucks for lunch for 4. Experienced it (nice atmosphere) but NEVER again!! Food was sub-par. Given prices, expected better. Pierogi meal was drowned in extremely heavy sauce. Couldn't recognize the broccoli In the dish as sauce was ridiculously thick.  Smoked baked beans that accompanied the porkchop meal were \"doctored-up\" Campbell's canned beans at best. Our table even joked they had EXACT same color, size & appearance of Campbell's!! Just add liquid smoke flavor, dump into serving dish & charge$$$$. Gross. Cocktails & beers were very good. Service fair. But AVOID food, too pricey & not tasty. Lots of better options in the city."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is a fun place for out-of-town guests because of the unique architecture.  The beer is decent (dunkel is my favorite) but the food is hit-or-miss.  It's better to come here for a drink and have dinner elsewhere.  Food prices are a little high and I've never had anything that I would want to order again.  Pierogies are the best back-up if you have to eat here."}
{"text":"Have been there before. Don't quite remember the cuisine, but this place you should try, to see how it feels to eat in a church."}
{"text":"Beer was great.  Atmosphere was great.   Food was good, Buffalo cauliflower was tasty.  Service was terrible.  They didn't have 2 of the signature beers available...  Beer wasn't that good that it made up for the service.  I'll get beer/food somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I'm so a fan of this place! It's an actual old church with a brewery on the pulpit! The food is good, the pizza's are great, they're made in a brick oven (or taste like they are), the couscous salad is phenom, and the while they have a small selection of brewed on-site beers, it's totally quality over quantity. I haven't had a beer there that wasn't yummy and interesting.   The mango curry was very disappointing, and the chipotle ketchup for the sweet potato fries is lacking any major flavor (the fries themselves are yummy though).  Beautiful decor inside and wonderful quiet beer garden outside. Always a blast!!"}
{"text":"stopped by for a Saturday lunch and asked bartender Megan for a pizza recommendation...15 minutes later we get the Cinco Formaggio with tomatoes and bacon (which she claims as been unofficially dubbed 'the Megan special' by kitchen staff) and we haven't been the same since.  Our pizza bar has been reset."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrible, taking 30 min to get a beer and I've been here an hour and a half with not even an appetizer in front of me. It's a Tuesday night that is a little busier because there is an FOP convention in town.  You should have prepared!"}
{"text":"Really fresh, unique beers. Loved the pumpkin stout. Good food, had the pierogies, very buttery.  Excellent friendly service"}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of a friend. Each of us got the standard flight of beers since none of us had been here before. We had a very friendly waiter, and the brewery is beautiful. I loved that most of the church architecture such as the pipes from the organ and the stained glass windows are still there. The beers are not the most mind blowing, but they were decent. A great place to stop by when visiting pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I visit CBW reasonably frequently, so my comments may be a repeat of previous reviews.  On this trip, I tried the Mad Mardigan's Spiced Baltic Porter, which I liked so much, I had two. I had pirogies and a very tasty salad, and my friend had an (always amazing) pizza.  I've never had a bad meal here, and I love trying the non-traditional pirogies (which usually sound super weird, but are always good).  I love this place because of the cool interior, easy parking, and reliably good food, beer, and service.  Amen!"}
{"text":"The beer here is very good, and brewed in house (or in church, if you prefer). It is kinda fun seeing the beer being brewed where the altar used to be. The food is pretty good, though a little over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good beer selection.  Potato pizza was too starchy. Unique restaurant with a varied menu."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for beer and fries. The service was great and the sweet potato fries were yummy. I would go back again if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place to show visitors to Pittsburgh since it is \"quirky\" and \"unique,\" and it seems to be a hit with visitors - and indeed, the ambiance is quite nice.  However the food quality is sub-par especially with regards to the elevated prices for 4 boiled pierogies or a $13 \"Pittsburgh salad.\"  If memory serves correctly, the pizza is a decent option for dining but it is not found on the main dinner menu.  The beer selection is OK, they offer an interesting sampling flight.  No reservations on the weekends."}
{"text":"A must do one time for the atmosphere and church. Beer is good. Food not so good.  Chose the mussels and was overwhelmed by onions and garlic. Go once because everyone should. But drink only. Don't waste your money on the food."}
{"text":"Yes this is a place for great beer.  Tonight's selection is their Octoberfest.  Smooth, malty, a solid selection.  The food menu is constantly changing.  Tonight a four onion soup made with barley from the brewing process.  My wife and I split a plate of traditional pierogi and one of chicken parmesan pierogi.  Both plates about tapas sized and both excellent choices."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Pittsburgh. Awesome beer, awesome space, and pretty decent food. Love it."}
{"text":"Great beer, excellent atmosphere, good food. Try the musles, and the pizza."}
{"text":"The beer is excellent.  More varieties than most small breweries and served at the exact right temperature.  I liked it so much I spent $20 bucks extra on two six packs to share with friends when my business trip ends.  The food is good, with some exotic ingredients that seem to try to justify $22 for pasta.  A little expensive even for a self-proclaimed food snob.  I don't like to write negative reviews because too many on Yelp expect to be overly pampered, but the Church Brew Works earned it.  Read on.  Be careful with the menus.  We received a dinner menu with $20+ entrees.  After seeing a wood-fired pizza oven in the corner, but no pizza on the menu, our waitress found another menu with food at less expensive prices (in the teens).  This menu included many creative varieties of pizzas on it, plus other interesting dishes not mentioned.  The moral is out-of-owners should ask for the BAR MENU  This isn't the Lunch Menu, Dinner Menu, or the Beer Menu.  Yes, they have four menus."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome pizza, drinks and you can't beat the venue!"}
{"text":"They don't brew a single good beer, menu's very pricey, and a lot of the food is meh.  When I went I had a chicken pot pie that was really good but everyone else's food was lacking."}
{"text":"This is a must see if your in the downtown Pittsburgh area. Attentive and fast service. The ambiance is worth a trip!! The beers were excelent and the food was well prepared. Didn't care for the rattlesnake pierogi, but different strokes as the saying goes. A solid 4 star."}
{"text":"I take all my friends here who come to visit from out of town. It is a neat venue and the food/brew are great. They offer vegan and vegetarian options which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable staff, great beer, great food (possibly some of the best pizza in the city). Nuff said."}
{"text":"Nice location for a brewery.  Everything was good: the beer, perogies and pulled pork tacos.  The ambiance is what makes his place special.  I will be back to try more of their seasonal brews!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not sure I would eat very much here again, other than appetizers maybe, but holy crap I gotta give them credit for turning a \"house of God\" into a \"house of sin.\" Seriously they completely replaced the entire altar section, where all the Jesuses and the saints would have been permanently captured in marble or whatever, with thousand-gallon stainless steel fermenting/storage tanks. Awesome.  The pierogies we had were great, but not very hot. Maybe warm. And then because our table was under some kind of arctic air vortex, the pierogies became cold rather quickly. *IMPORTANT* Make sure you bring a sweatshirt when you go here!  My couscous salad was okay, but it had too much tangy stuff on it. It was a spinach salad with couscous, then it had goat cheese (tangy), marinated artichoke hearts (tangy), and a red pepper vinaigrette (very tangy, and too much of it).  You should probably go here if you come to Pittsburgh, but you might want to just come and order bar food, not actually like for-real entre things. And since I don't drink beer, I can't comment on the brews, but one member of my group had a lighter-colored beer and it looked like she was enjoying it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Neat atmosphere in an historic church, and fantastic food. Had the buffalo burger and an American Pale ale. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Come for the novelty and a few beers.  Food was average and the service both at the bar and a table was very slow.  We actually left the bar and moved to a table in hopes we'd get served because we had waited 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, it didn't help.  We waited another 10 before getting beers at our table.  Sorry, but if I'm in a brewery, get me a beer immediately and I can wait as long as needed for food."}
{"text":"First, the good:  The atmosphere and decor is amazing, it is a huge, beautiful old church and is just such a fun space to visit.  Next the not-quite-so-good:  The beer is okay/average for local brewery swill, but  considerably overpriced.  We'd visit a lot more often and probably end up spending more overall if the beer prices weren't so outrageous.  And finally, the not-good:  The food.  Granted we only tried one item, but it was AWFUL.  We ordered their basket of \"homemade chips\" and they were disgusting - cold, soggy spiral-sliced potatoes that were stale (not crispy) and congealed with grease.  Inedible.   The bartender said that they \"make them fresh every day\" - ours had apparently been made in the morning and had sat around in their own cold grease all day.   We politely sent them back but the bartender didn't seem very happy about it and we spend the remainder of the visit wondering if we were going to have to argue with her about paying for them (as it turned out, we were not charged).   Final thoughts: it's a cool bar, but the novelty has worn off for us. Mediocre beer at inflated prices and terrible food."}
{"text":"Came here on 10-10-10, the Food Network was taping a show and we got free beer, appetizers, it was great. The food was excellent, the beers were all completely different. The ambiance is amazing and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so awesome being in there. It's just so cool. They've converted the pews into tables. There's a gigantic beer brewing thing at the front of the church (think where the altar would be.). Am I the only one that thinks it's hilarious that a church is now a bar?  I love it.  It's just such a unique place and the food is great, I've never gotten anything there I didn't really really enjoy. I've been here a lot but this one meal sticks out in my mind as the best ever. It was simple, a piece of salmon and mashed potatoes and I think spinach on the side. I also had one of the best desserts ever here, an apple strudel and vanilla ice cream. They really have a way of taking simpler menu items and jazzing them up and making them fantastic. Side note - their pizza rocks."}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away when I walked in the door! I LOVE churches AND breweries...really, could it get any better than this?! NOPE!   I tried their sampler beers and I was really impressed, Pittsburgh has some great local beers I must say. To eat I was reccommended the Pierogi Pizza, sounds like an odd combo but I was up for it. To my surprise I really liked it and would reccommend it for those of you reading this. I also had the 7 onion soup which was basically their version of french onion soup, still it was good. My aunt had the seasonal pumpkin soup-holy cow, its like pumpkin pie but soup-amazing!  As I am from Los Angeles, I really take a liking to novelty places like this as we dont really have them here. But if I was a local you'd probably find me frequenting this place. If I'm ever in the area again this will be the first stop I make."}
{"text":"It's cool that they brew their own beers. I wasn't a huge fan of the food and beer, but it is a neat restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Magnificent building!  So thankful they saved the building and provided another unique dining choice.  I've sat next to nuns, I've sat next to priests, I've been to the Church Brew Works with my mom and grandmother...and we all loved it.  Granted I have seen people walk in and spin on their heels to get out as quick as possible after seeing the placement of the brewing equipment, but that is so very rare.   I often have people in town for business and this is almost always on my tour of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food's ok. The beer was uninspiring. Too many other choices to go back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this brewery! They have a diverse selection of beer and it is all sold at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is excellent and so unique. The food was delicious as well. I would highly recommend a visit if you are a beer lover!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Church.  Their non traditional pierogies are almost always a great choice, paired with the pizza and their beer brewed on site, this is a must stop when in the Bloomfield area of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, and the beer was delightful. I got the Millennium Triple, which had the perfect amount of citrus. Next I had the Oktoberfest, which I'm pretty sure I could have drank many, many pints of, but I stopped myself after one.   Now, to the food. The pierogies were a bit too greasy and not as flavor-filled as I've had them (we tried both the traditional and \"untraditional\" which on that day were bratwurst and sauerkraut filled). We also shared the risotto lollipops which were very nice (the sauce was the highlight) and the sweet potato fries which were nothing too spectacular.   But oh, OHHH, the main course. I got the smoked pork chop with the beet BBQ sauce of the Oktoberfest menu, and it was memorable. The sweet sauce and the perfectly smoked chop were an amazing combination. The spaetzle and sauerkraut were exactly what the dish needed to balance out and the portions were very generous.   Dessert we shared German chocolate cake, pumpkin bread pudding, and black forest cheese cake - all were wonderfully done. I really enjoyed the flavor of the bread pudding, very warm and homey, and the texture of the cheesecake was perfectly light thanks to the ricotta cheese.   I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because the appetizers were just an OK-start to what turned into a fabulously memorable meal in a fun atmosphere that I will suggest anyone passing through Pittsburgh check out. I'd gladly return (hopefully in the fall so I can get some more Oktoberfest brew...)"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place. My review would just be that the church part is cool. Makes for a unique atmosphere. But we stopped in to try some beers and they just weren't very good."}
{"text":"The concept is cool. A Brewery in a church. the architecture and environment are definitely there, but it is lacking on really the two defining factors of a brew pub -- the food and the beer. The beer is fine but nothing to write home about. The food is not great and service is slow. Overall it is worth a visit to experience it, but I dont think it is a place I will be frequenting often."}
{"text":"Today I came here and had the best French onion soup I've ever had.   Also great beer. I had the coffee stout, which was flavorful but still light and not too filling. My sister had the Red Wine Barrel Trippel. When I asked her what her rating is, her response was \"great.\" If you knew Rachel you would know that it takes a lot to get a great out of Rach.   Additionally, there was an amazing 90's music mix playing. Doesn't get better than that.   Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Ate there a couple weeks ago- it was pretty fun for a large group. Cool atmosphere, lovely stained glass. Food was pretty good- just had a salad and the hummus appetizer. Everyone (8 people) liked his/her food. Brews were pretty good.   I would've given a four star,  but it was pretty hot in there and did have a slightly skunky smell. Not just from the brewing- more like beer spilled on floor and mopped up with dirty water. Not really bad, but a subtle scent that you'll catch every now and then. I guess if you drink enough brews, then you probably won't care :)  Next time I would probably sit outside."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and have never had an excellent experience.  Let me get the pros out of the way first: 1. The building is very beautiful and interesting. It's worth going at least once just to experience it. 2. The variety of menu items is very good and the descriptions make everything sound delicious. 3. They have a nice selection of specialty pizzas, all of which are wonderful.  Although I enjoy some aspects of this place, I have quite a few issues with it: It's loud. Oh my is it loud. If it is even semi-busy, good luck trying to have a nice conversation at your table inside the restaurant. Every noise happening inside of the place echoes across the entire dining area. People talking, glasses clinking, forks and knives on plates, chairs sliding across the floor, everything. They do have a small outdoor section which is really nice for avoiding the insane amount of noise, but both times I've been seated out there, I feel like the waiter forgot about us for long periods of time. I know it is usually a busy place, but I've experienced far longer delays sitting outside than inside. Out of sight, out of mind I suppose.  The staff do seem pretty friendly and helpful when they come around, despite dealing with large quantities of people and orders during their shift. By the end of the night, as they're rushing around between tables and chairs, you can see it on some of their faces that they just want the insanity to end, but still greet you with a friendly smile when they come up to your table.  They rave about their food and beer, but in my opinion, it is definitely lacking. Everything is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants and nothing lives up to it's reputation. I did mention that the pizzas are delicious, they are, and they are almost worth the cost. Some of their beers are pretty tasty, but just not worth the cost. Nothing really blows me away here.  Groups. The place is pretty large and can easily accommodate a few large groups at a time. On my last visit, I went here with a group of 11 people for a work-related party. We called ahead to make a reservation and they told us that although they do not technically take reservations, they try to work it out so that when one group seems like they'll be leaving, they are ready to seat the next group. It doesn't work. If you're going to try and assume when one group is going to be done before they even get there, why not just take an actual reservation and set a specific time frame? We all arrived and were seated rather quickly, maybe a 10-15 minute wait only. We ordered a variety of pizzas and beers to share around the table. There were about 8 pizzas total and everybody had ordered 1-3 beers in the time we were there.  We were there for almost 2 hours in which the first hour was basically getting us seated, looking at the menu, ordering our food and beers, and waiting for it all to arrive. The next 40 minutes consisted of us consuming the pizza and some beer and having a general conversation and enjoying our time. We were just about to finish the last few slices of pizza and everybody had ordered one more beer when some well-dressed woman approached our table and told us to hurry ourselves because she had another group waiting for our table and that they had been waiting for 1 hour already. She then threw a stack of drink tickets (good for one free beer on our next visit) on the table for our trouble, and rushed away. We couldn't believe it. After the first hour of being seated, ordering our food, and finally getting it served, she had already expected us to be ready to leave because they had another group that wanted to sit. We were actively eating, drinking, and ordering more the entire time we were there, so it's not like we were just sitting there and wasting space.  As I said, we already tried to call and make a reservation, because that seems like the smartest thing to do, but they don't do reservations. They just expect to guess when a group will come in and be ready to leave and then basically push you out the door if their system doesn't work out. After that, we quickly gathered our things and left. Needless to say, I still have a stack of drink tickets on my desk that I haven't used yet. I don't know if I'll go back after that last time. I've never had a great experience when I've gone here and the last time really put the nail in the coffin."}
{"text":"I went to the Church Brew Works on May 25th at 9:30 PM.  I wanted to watch the Pens game with a beer. I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant staff. Right away no one wanted to get a drink for my date and me because it seemed like everyone was cleaning up. If you want to close then don't serve us, but they gave us beers and we took a seat to watch the game. While sitting the manager on site told the wait staff, within ear shot, that it looks like these people will never leave. I can understand wanting to get home, but that's not professional. Then a few moments later this same manager took a panoramic picture of the nearly empty restaurant, my date and me included. I did not want to be in a picture. I was however openly photographed. The wait staff was watching the game, good please do, but why is the manager, who should be setting the example, video tapping the patrons? The entire time we were there, we felt the message that was being sent to us was LEAVE. This is not the first time we have received less than stellar service from a really cool restaurant. What a shame. What a shame that customers aren't more welcome... at a restaurant... Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Had shrimp n grits in past it was great. Last night was not quite as good. They put cilantro instead of micro greens on top. Menu doesn't say cilantro it says micro greens. What if I didn't like cilantro. Shrimp was undercooked. Or sever was MIA most of the time. Took food order was gone. Dropped off food was gone did not check on us once or ask if everything was ok. Dropped check off took forever to come back. I was a waitress for a long time so I know how it is. Maybe a different cook from the last time I visited. Food was luke warm. I was kinda embarrassed because I recommended we go there it was our first date. We enjoyed our time together but the food was nowhere near as good as it was the first time it was there. It's all about consistency. No effort was put into that dish. And for 23 bucs very disappointing! I have a picture but yelp is saying not enough space to post."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant! Memorial Day weekend we had a 6:30 reservation for 8 and we got our table right away. We ordered drinks while we looked at the menu. When the waiter was taking our order one of our group asked him a question about the menu and instead of answering her he said \"obviously you are not ready so I'll have to come back\". Very rude. He finally came back and we ordered appetizers and our entrees. An hour went by and we still hadn't got our appetizers. We asked the waiter and he said he would check on them. Another half hour goes by and still no food. We asked to see the manager and we explained the situation to him and his response was \"I don't know what to tell you. I have been busy working the line in the kitchen\". As it turns out, the genius waiter had put our order in to go and gave it to another table that took the food and left. Needless to say, at that point we walked out. My advice...go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Updating my original review--  on these cold winter days, I strongly recommend the perogie pizza.  It really warms you up.  I think this menu item is much more appropriate to order in winter than on a hot summer day, like what I did last time.  Still five stars, great restaurant."}
{"text":"i don't doubt that many people have bad experiences at this restaurant, because I can see how a lot of the food is overpriced the hosting station seemed to be a little lackluster.  My experience went quite smoothly however.  I went with four people, after our slightly confused looking hostess found us a seat, we were provided with great service.  The service was intelligent, but in a very scripted manner.  The beer was good, great compared to american craft and decent compared to european breweries.  The building is a lot of fun, huge renovated church with shiny stainless steel fermenting silos covering the side wall and the altar.  I chose the special for the night, which was rib-eye finished in the wood burning oven and a cranberry chutney.  It was good, charred on the outside, not overdone and a good cut of meat to begin with.  The prices are high for what you get though, meaning I wasn't stuffed after my meal.  Main Pro: Good local beer Main Con: The smell of the bar, not the fermentation, was fairly strong."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Awesome building!  So-So beer.  There are better microbrews by a long shot in Pittsburgh such as East End and Full Pint.   The Church Brew Works beer is average at best.  The pizza is great, the rest of the food is going to be solid as well.  Of course you go here for the fantastic building, and that part does not disappoint.  This is not going to be your regular haunt, but it's a great place to take an out of town visitor."}
{"text":"A few familiy members were in town to see a Pirates day game and they had gone to the Church Brew Works last year and enjoyed it, so I joined them this year to grab a beer and small bite to eat before the game.  I hadn't been here in awhile since I had lived near Philly for the last 5 years, so I was looking forward to it.      The atmosphere is unique because you're drinking in an old church and because of all of the tanks of brewing beer throughout.  Mmmmmmm.  I had 2 seasonal drafts, Lavender Summer Ale and Ambrosia Ale.  Both beers weren't what I would normally care for because they were light and floral tasting with citrus notes, but on that particular day it was about 91 outside and muggy and they both hit the spot. Not too heavy and very refreshing.                                                    I ordered the Cajun Risotto Fritters for a quick bite and they were very good.  Crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with chorizo and jack cheese.  They were served with Tabasco aioli which was a little spicy and just made me drink my beer a little quicker.  Not a bad thing.      We sat at the bar and our bartender was very knowledgeable and pleasant.  The only negative about our visit was that the hardwood floor near the bar was very sticky.  I don't know why since they had just opened for the day. Maybe someone forgot to clean it, but it was just a minor annoyance."}
{"text":"I would never come back to this place again, because we were made to feel so bad about ourselves today. The waiter walked up and checked the tip as soon as we put down the pen. He looked very unpleasant and asked us if today's service was okay. I was a bit shocked and thought I did a wrong calculation. After I double checked that it was more than 16% which would still fall into an acceptable range, I asked if there's anything particular wrong about it. The waiter replied that he would asked if the service is okay if any customer is giving less than 20%. I really did not know there's an expectation of at least 20% here. I was paying tips in this city 15%-20% for more than two years.This was the first time someone made me feel so bad about it."}
{"text":"10 stars on atmosphere!  Sometimes the food can be a little off, seemingly more so at lunch time, but generally this is an excellent place to go.  Wonderful for those new to Pittsburgh, or to those entertaining those new to Pittsburgh.  This place is wheelchair accessible (husband uses a power chair), including the outside patio, although I'm not sure that the men's room is (haven't been in there and the ladies room is up some stairs I believe).  It really seems like the beer has gotten a lot better over the years too!"}
{"text":"Good food which is the most important factor, obviously. Creative menu- simple but with good variety. Also great atmosphere- who doesn't love unconventional uses for lovely churches? But the service was not great. Our waiter brought us the wrong wine, forgot our appetizers, and generally neglected us. Despite the service I would recommend it overall for the experience."}
{"text":"meh...........as a native Pittsburgher, I think this place is trendy and overpriced.  I'd rather go to Penn Brewery at the bottom of Troy Hill."}
{"text":"Have to say I must of been crazy not to visit this place sooner in my life.  Walked in the door and was just in awe of the atmosphere. Yes, it's just like its advertised...a Roman Catholic church turned restaurant/brewery.   The food we had was adequate. No over portion sizes for Lunch here. Prices were good.   A trip to a brewery without tasting beer is just unAmerican...so we had a few samples. The IPA was hoppy as expected with the bite in the aftertaste quite brisk.  What I found even better was the Cherry Quadzilla, a special beer they make, not always on tap but today it was. Has such great flavor, goes down smooth, cherry/Carmel taste with just a hint of bite.  Could drink it all day, however with the higher than most alcohol content, I don't recommend too much if you have to drive!   All and all it was a great experience. The chocolate moose cake is good for an ending treat!! ( comes with 3 pieces of peanut brittle on the side). For me to say it was good means something because I don't even like chocolate cake!!  Will definitely be going back again in the near future!!"}
{"text":"The beer is great. The service is sometimes good, sometimes not so much. The room is lovely. The food is meh. I've been here at least 4 times and the food has never been more than just adequate. I think the menu ideas  are interesting, but execution is generally a problem. The unique pierogies aren't very good. They don't even wrap them in pierogy dough, but rather wonton wrappers. I'm still waiting for Pittsburgh to prove themselves as the world capital of pierogies.   Basically I wouldn't go here for dinner, but drinks and snacks. The brie with figs and port reduction goes well with beer."}
{"text":"Best micro-brew in Pittsburgh! Building restoration is beautiful. Burgers are great too. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"After trekking from the Andy Warhol museum for four miles, the church of brew was a heavenly oasis. Unfortunately the beer was subpar but the atmosphere is like no other. Casks where the pipe organ was. Angels carrying steins of beer on a fresco.  the food was okay too, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Came early on a Saturday night with a party of 5, including a 6-year-old. Had a wonderful experience in this reclaimed Catholic church.  We started at the bar, where we sampled some of the beers--the Celestial Gold, the the Cherry Quadzilla, and the Pious Monk Dunkel. All were fine, and there's something to be said for having a beer with Saints Patrick and Bridget watching over you...  For dinner, two of us got the price fixe menu, which included the Cajun risotto fritters as an appetizer. Now sometimes with PF setups, each component is a little smaller than the separate item on the full menu. Not here. Another of us had gotten the fritters separately, and there were just as many as in the PF menu. (And they were awesome--light, spicy, crunchy on the outside.)  For entrees, we had the strip steak, the seafood mac and cheese, the pork tenderloin, and plain buttered pasta for my nephew. We were served quickly and professionally, and my God, was the food good. And we were so stuffed that we had to bring home the desserts. (Malted bread pudding a la mode, and it was good for breakfast the next day!) Saints Michael and Margaret Mary were our guardians during dinner, and they approved.  It's not the cheapest place in Pittsburgh, but the food and atmosphere is worth every penny. The place was packed by the time we left, which is a good sign."}
{"text":"Good food, but the beer brewed on site in this former church is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Good beers, equally good pizzas (the restaurant is also pretty nice, but the combination of well-made pizzas and beer is just a lot better). The main issue was to decide who would be driving back. :-)"}
{"text":"The last time I tried to get in, it was so crowded that we gave up and went elsewhere. The pepper beer was terrible, like they fell in the vat with a whole pepper container. The other types of beer have been good. Their pizza was really cheesy and really good. We usually don't order anything else off the menu. It's a good place to go if they're not too busy."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip in town for a few days.Always wanted to con here and I think I built it up way too much in my head. The atmosphere is just what you would expect. It is like a giant brewery hall,which was great!!!.There are a lot of food choices but bit pricy. Only one burger on menu. The beer is what really got me though. I have been drinking microbrews for a good part of 10 years. The 2 beers I had were weak. Now for someone that is typically not a microbrew drinkers, then they will like them. But if you are looking foe beers with a bit of a punch and have have character, this is not it."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp, as I was waiting for a truly inspirational experience about which to write. After Church Brew Works, one might say I was born again.  I was in Pittsburgh for the first time this past week, attending a conference for work. The conference, while worth the travel in and of itself, more importantly provides an excellent chance to reconnect with colleagues from around the country. Thus, I was looking forward to the unstructured time in evenings, and choosing the gathering place for such periods is a delicate art. I ended up spending two nights at Church Brew Works, and it's not as though there was a lack of options. This place is special.  The first night, I went to CBW after dinner. Upon arrival, I ordered the sampler to split with a friend, to get our bearings and at least have a taste of the four mainstays and the four seasonals. The sampler was priced right at around $14 for eight five-ounce glasses. While I was less excited by some brews (like the Celebration), I was amazed by the complexity of both the Rotating Stout and the Four-Grain Harvest Ale. I drank Harvest Ales until they kicked us out that night.  The second night, we headed back to CBW for dinner. This night, I drank Rotating Stout exclusively. Very crisp for a stout, with an awesome smokey finish. I ordered the salmon entree for dinner. For $19, I figured it had to be good. Plus, the drafts were very reasonably priced, so I didn't mind spending a bit more on food. The salmon truly exceeded my expectations. It was perfectly cooked with minimal seasoning and placed atop a refreshing quinoa salad with cucumber. Sauteed oyster mushrooms accompanied the fish, which were delicious. The plate was ringed with a tasty soy reduction to provide salt, which complemented all the items perfectly. I could see how the soy might have been a bit strong for someone else, but I think it brought an appropriate kick to the dish.  I continued to drink the Rotating Stout all night while we discussed the eventual collapse of civil society. Perfect conversation against the backdrop of an altar filled with heavy brewing equipment. There is something post-apocalyptic yet fantastically optimistic about CBW. Perhaps it's the not-so-subtle notion that our reverie should not be focused on a deity hovering in the heavens or a member of the clergy thumping on the pulpit, but rather, toward one another, in a place where the provisions nourish the soul and the communion is about building community."}
{"text":"Great beers, friendly service, cool building, what more do you need?  The food was good to boot, although the menu was a bit limited in certain areas.  The Quatro Formaggio pizza was outstanding as were the Pierogi's.  Had a great time and will return if we ever visit Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Beautiful building makes this one of the coolest breweries ever. But what about the food and beer?  First off, pierogies are stellar. Don't miss these.   The 7 onion soup is as good a French onion soup as I've ever had. Large serving size as well.   My son loved his buffalo burger and fries.   I had the Pittsburgh salad which was excellent.   My wife has the chicken and Brie sandwich and felt that she had ordered poorly.   As for the beer, the Ambrosia Ale and Thunderfoam IPA were excellent. I enjoyed the Pilsner, thunderhop IPA and the dunkel, and the maibock wasn't bad. Unfortunately the trading places porter wasn't to my liking and the IPL was terrible.   Overall this place was pretty great and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great brick open pizzas... my favorite is the southwest pizza  Great variety and taste of home brewed beers.  My friends had the filete mignon and the mat loaf and both were really good."}
{"text":"Just as Soba is THE place for a cozy cocktail + conversation combo, CBW is THE place for party pitchers + pizza pleas-ahhh.  Many, MANY a happy drunken night spent at CBW. Fabulous micro-brews (really, really delicious) + great wait staff (well, most of the time... Props to Joe, my long-suffering long-haired hilarious hero. Always fun) = YAY!  P.S. Sorry about the alliteration. Sometimes I can't keep the dork at bay."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is a Pittsburgh tradition.  Its the prototypical place that you take your family when they come to town and want to personally view the sacrilege of multiple beer vats sitting on an re purposed church altar.    Thus the blessing and the burden of Church Brew Works: Its a great place that embodies Pittsburgh through and through.  Beer!  Wings!  Pizza!  Salad with French Fries!!!  Traditional Perogies!!!  Overpriced and over rated non traditional perogies like turkey dinner and bacon!!!  But its also notoriously crowded on weekends with customers from out of town asking if they are pronouncing \"yinz\" correctly and trying to insert \"n'at\" into conversation.  If you can beat the crowds to get a seat, I highly recommend the pizza and the Pittsburgh salad.  The rest of the menu is pretty hit or miss.  The quality of things like wings, sandwiches most appetizers vary wildly based on how busy the restaurant is on the given night.  Service is unremarkable but good.  Prices are a little steep, especially for the drinks."}
{"text":"I guess it could be a cool experience if you're a tourist since it's different given that a church is converted to a brewery, however as a local it is definitely lacking greatly.  The service was very slow and our food came out cold.  Based on the prices, you would expect more but they don't seem to really get it.  Our waiter continuously forgot things and our dinner experience took far longer than we anticipated as we had to keep waiting to get what we asked for, i.e drink refills, condiments, etc.   Definitely won't be returning as the prices sure don't reflect the level of service that it should."}
{"text":"Wow what a sight!  We went to the church tonight, I know a day early right? Seeing tomorrow was sunday, we figured we would go Saturday and use the time Sunday to nurse our heavenly hangover. The food was fantastic, we had heard the pizza was great and thats what we planned on having. OH NOOOO! Apparently the pizza oven was on fire like the depths of hell! We chose the Meatloaf (YUM) and the Cajun Strip that our server suggested. And oh lord, I pray to god we have food this godly again. Our server, Kelly, was just the greatest, she made great suggestions on beer. Her pairings were absolutely fantastic and I was surprised at her knowledge of beer. All in all this was a fantastic experience I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good,but not completely amazing. The environment and the beer selection are definitely what you're paying for!  The place is stunning and is a great place to meet up with friends.  The service was also really great and attentive!"}
{"text":"I don't know who these people are goofing and gawing over this brew house. While the church interior is impressive that is where the wonder ends.   Not a beer person myself so I ordered a sangria which they were out of so had the bartender made me a mixed drink. My first mistake. It was overly sweet and had no alcohol very college style.   We ordered the Belgium fries that turned out to be soggy hand cut fries that were not twice fried. The white aioli sauce (which should be yellow since it is made with egg yolks) was just mayonnaise that had been dumped with dill and salt  - in other words, it was terrible.   We ordered the vegetable pizza which is a white pizza but no where is that mentioned the the menu. It was dry, dry as dust and flavorless. The crust was really good and would make good pretzels.  And now for the important part. My husband the beer snob was excited to try the beers! First the Coffee beer he thought was average and wouldn't drink again. The second was a Smokey Sour which was just lightly smokey and no sour. Disappointed with the brews he ordered a sample of Inside Out Stout which golden on color and was in no way a stout. Husband said all the beers were just weird and not in a good way.  He also didn't like that the beers were served with a LOT of foam/head.  We can't recommend this place, sad face. Maybe this place is fancy eats for college kids but our tastes have long matured."}
{"text":"This restaurant would have rated 4 stars but for our Server. I've heard about Church Brew for some time and had not set out to eat here, but the restaurant we originally planned had closed. The setting is very nice. The food we had (pork tacos verdes and pierogie saute) was excellent. Unlike the station next to ours, Anthony did not explain the beer list, despite our question about a sampler offering we'd seen on the way to our table and questions about the beer selection. He did not take time with our questions and was inattentive after someone else delivered our food. He never refilled our drinks or offered refills or dessert. I noticed the table next to ours asked for a dessert menu and he delivered it without comment or highlighting and no order was placed. We are normally generous tippers, but Anthony got the minimum 15%. I write this for the purpose of constructive comment. All of this cost our Server and the restaurant money. The Server next to us, on the other hand (blonde/white-haired female) took time with each of the two tables we watched to go over the menu and specials in great detail and regularly followed up with her patrons for questions or refills, etc. She also brought the dessert menu and highlighted a couple items which resulted in an order. The food was excellent and although some light background music and a tad more light would have been nice, I will return with visitors, but Anthony needs a slight tune-up and he will be rewarded for his efforts."}
{"text":"We had high hopes. Lots of friends who had visited or lived in Pittsburgh told us to come here. What's not to love?! Drinking beer in a church? On Good Friday? Cool!  We entered the church around 2pm and it wasn't busy at all but we sat at the bar to do a flight. We sat there for about 8 minutes and it wasn't until an older couple sat next to us that someone served us who was annoyed about being a bartender that day and dude, I get it. I've been in the food industry myself for 8 years. Maybe they were short staffed and this person had to fill in, maybe they don't have a proper day bartender. But still, pretend like you want my money.  After a rushed flight, our bartender ignored us, asked the couple next to us if they wanted anything. They said no, ready for the check so the bartender preceded to then print our check, place it in front of us and then take away our empty glasses.   I guess we were done too? Worst service I've received in a long, long, long time. Being we had never been there before, it would of been nice if someone actually talked to us about the beer. The church is an experience. But customer service is also about experience and this place has not combined both of them.  Also, hella old people in there."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. The food was nothing to write home about, but the beer was good and the atmosphere is cool and laid back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere really is great and well worth the visit. It just feels so naughty drinking beer in a church but hey that's what makes it fun!   The food to me is just okay  for the price BUT the beer is much better! Who needs food when you have a frothy glass of beer?"}
{"text":"On our way back from Baltimore, we decided to stop in Pittsburgh for a day of sight seeing. One of the people that I was with heard about this restaurant so we decided to check it out. Upon entering, I seriously thought that we were in a church. The brewery in a church does seem like a funny punch line though.  I ended up having the salmon, which was great but not the best compared to some other places that I ate at on the east coast. The only drawback here was that I thought the entrees were a little too pricey. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would come here again, but only on a special occasion."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh! This place has good brews and it's in a freaking church! Beautiful windows and the pricing is good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"You really can't do better than Church Brews.  Great food and beer with an atmosphere that is second to none."}
{"text":"It's a neat place. My kids loved their meals (pasta with red sauce and a burger with fries). Hubby enjoyed his beer flight. Overall, the food was mediocre though. We had to send the lamb meatballs back twice for not being warm enough. Pork tostadas also went back for being cold. Grits were really good. Our server was very friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to Church Brew Works.  However, the major issue is the management.  We went on a Saturday night and it was packed.  All of the waitstaff were working their asses off.  But the troubling thing was, they had at least 5 hosts/hostesses sitting up front on their phones.  As a former waitress and even just as a customer, I was offended.  There is no reason they should be that overstaffed with hosts/hostesses doing the job of one person.  A good manager would have these excess personnel refilling water glasses (mine was empty for a large portion of the evening) or clearing tables.    The food was good, especially the bison meatloaf and the beer flights were huge.  I was just really troubled by the dichotomy between the waitstaff juggling at least 10 tables of large groups and the hostesses literally doing nothing."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Good beers and really good food in this cathedral of craft beer. I'll definiitely go back."}
{"text":"Honestly, go just to see the inside of this place. It is absolutely mind blowing. Our bartender, I'm sorry his name escapes me, was very nice and helpful. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Unique location and good food, the flags remind me at my original home (Bavaria), can recommend the pizza and the carrot cake :)"}
{"text":"Have been attending the church whenever I've been in the burgh for the last 9 years or so. The Church is always fabulous! From the spiritual guidance of my pastor behind the bar to the typically wonderful rotating brews to the menu hands down the best place in the burgh."}
{"text":"Instead of being bored in church, I ate boar in Church Brew Works.  This was seriously one of the most unique places I've ever dined and imbibed. The church was gorgeous yet functional as a business. It was the perfect hybrid of a brewery, restaurant and church. The stained glass windows glistened in the sunlight and building dripped with nostalgia and history.   The food also falls into the category of the more unique things I've ever consumed. My husband and I split the Bison Corn Dogs and the Chicken and Boar Chorizo Jambalaya. The corn dogs were like carnival corn dogs on steroids. After having bison, I'm not sure if I can ever go back to the mystery meat of a regular corn dog. They were perfectly fried on the outside and the chipotle ketchup added a nice spicy dip. I don't normally eat ketchup but found it to be absolutely enjoyable. The jambalaya consisted of braised chicken and house made boar chorizo sausage simmered with tomatoes, peppers and onions in creole spices.  It was served over rice. It was flavored really well and I enjoyed it a bit too quickly.   What blew my mind was the Wild Boar BBQ Pizza. I sampled two slices from my friend and wish I ordered a whole pie for myself. Per the description it consisted of slow roasted pulled wild boar, Pious Monk Dunkel BBQ sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese. The BBQ sauce was tangy and the boar had a slight crisp to it.  All the ingredients blended perfectly together.   Having just watched a Travel Channel special that featured Church Brew Works, I was psyched to try the rattlesnake pierogie. To my disappointment, rattlesnake is a seasonal feature.  Apparently everyone asks about it.   Unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed by the beer. My husband and I split the sampler and I found most of the brews to fall a little flat. I typically love IPAs but this one just wasn't doing it for me. Since we didn't love any of the eight beers we sampled, we decided to try the Cherry Quadzilla. That evening it was only sold in a bottle so we ponied up the $16 and went for the full bottle. That was pretty decent. It was about 10% ABV but didn't taste that strong. The cherry flavor wasn't overly fruity but had a very strong presence in each sip.   Like most people I encountered on my Pittsburgh trip, our server was friendly and knowledgeable. My friend has a sweet tooth ordered two desserts for dinner. One of his desserts consisted of blueberry ice cream and a cookie and was new to the menu. She was very interested in his opinion about the new dessert and they had a great dialogue on it.   With all that being said, I would definitely recommend Church Brew Works to anyone visiting or living in Pittsburgh.  My rating is based on a 5 for atmosphere, 4.5 for food and 3.5 for beverage."}
{"text":"It is quite different as a restaurant running in a church... interesting and tasty beers, good food, a little expensive. I can't imagine this restaurant is so popular that even I came there at 9, there were still a lot of people waiting for seat."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  The beer is more bitter and if that's how you like it this is great.  I'm more a blue moon type so not really my taste.  Otherwise it was interesting to see a church turn into a brewery.  Have to check it out."}
{"text":"Went once more with out of town friends against my better judgement. The place continues to slide with service being the biggest negative. Food is sub-par. If you have never been here and are curious, just go and get a beer, check out the cool atmosphere and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is a go-to when we have out of town guests.  The beer is just okay, but the food has always been great.  The space is just fantastic though.  You can't go wrong with beer brewing at an alter!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the beer and the experience.  The brews were quite good -- I had the ThunderHop IPA and Pipe Organ Pale, and both fit nicely into the American tradition, with the Pipe Organ being slightly hoppier than expected, with a nice body and rounded flavor, and the ThunderHop approaching super-hop tendencies but not going over the top.    The space is great for visiting with friends and family, as long as nobody will be offended by brewery equipment holding the place of honor on the altar.  The food was solid but not a revelation, but it does just what it needs to, to not get in the way of the fun you're having enjoying beers in an old church.  I had a buffalo burger that was well-cooked without drying out at all, and the housemade chips were a great touch.  Our server was very friendly and helpful in navigating the menu and the takeout options (mmm, growlers). I don't know about the pricing, because my in-laws picked up the tab, which I'm sure also added to my enjoyment.    If you like beer, or dining for the experience, this is definitely worth a visit while in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! No more!  A group of us (11 total) went (had reservations) for a co-worker farewell lunch.  They had water already at the table when we arrived but beyond that the waiter never ask if anyone wanted a drink ; we ordered our food pretty quickly (at around noon) no appetizers; our food arrived approx. (1) hour later; it was cold.  The restaurant was nowhere near full and did not seem very busy.  The food was mediocre and the experience was poor at best.  The waiter was nice - but not very competent.  To top it off they were brewing beer right behind us during the lunch hour - so we had to continually talk over a loud obnoxious squealing noise at 20-min. intervals throughout an almost 2-hour ordeal.  Just plain rude!!  Seems that management here is more concerned about having enough craft beer for the Friday night happy hour/dinner guests than maintaining an acceptable atmosphere for their lunch patrons.  I will not go back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming beers and lackluster food. And they charged $1.50 for the ice in my bourbon."}
{"text":"I don't know about what some of these other reviewers have had to say, but we went on a weekend at 4:00pm, there was no wait for either the dining area or bar seating area. Our waiter was nice, I don't believe he ever mentioned his name.   I have got to say that the beer selections was on point, the food was delicious. I had the Cinco Formaggio Pizza which was excellent, the wife had the Cubano Sandwich which was very good.   We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the past several years with both large and small parties and while it's a fun place to eat thanks to the novelty of eating in a church, the experience is dampened by the ho-hum food and average beer.  Everything I've eaten here (including salads, sandwiches, and pierogi appetizers) has been okay, never above average.  The pizzas are pretty mediocre compared to what you can get elsewhere around Pittsburgh.  Overall, it might be worth a visit just for the fun of eating somewhere different, but I probably wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for great food."}
{"text":"A great place! We went on a tip from a friend- a great tip! Tasty beer! Food was a little different than typical bar/pub fare- everyone was happy with their choices."}
{"text":"Overall, the food is average. You go here for the experience, I mean how many people can say they've had a beer in a church? The cathedral ceilings, stained glass and the brewing equipment on the altar makes it like no other brewery I've seen before.  Great selection of craft beer. Order the sample for only $12.95 which comes with 8 samples!"}
{"text":"Hello Pittsburgh! The Catholic school girl in me has never been happier than at Church Brew Works. Seriously?! An old church turned brewery...ok, I'm in!   Real talk, this place is bad. ass. From the outside I got nervous...\"oh no, have I led my friends astray? Are we about to walk into mass? All this walking to explore a church\" alas, my fears were assuaged when my party walked into this little slice of heaven and everyone was ohhing and ahhing at its pure beauty. I mean literally, the altar is full of brewing beer! Check out my photos, the floor is still the original and the benches remain as seating options.   Onto the food: hella good. We got the bbq pizza and oh mylanta. Hell yes. So good! And I don't even like bbq pizza!! It came out hot and delicious straight from the oven and it was everything you could ever want out of 'za.  The beer. Unfortunately this is the only reason for that last little star remaining blank...it was ok. Wasn't hop out of my seat and start cheering. BUT the names are all relics of the church life which was pretty sweet.  I'll be back next time I visit for certain!"}
{"text":"I went to the Church Brew Works based on a recommendation from a native of the burgh.   It is a very unexpected and interesting setup.  If you didn't know you were going to a restaurant, you really don't find out until you walk into the 'church'.   I'm a thin crust - brick oven pizza junkie !!  If there is a brick oven in the house, I usually can't resist.  I ordered the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza  - Chicken breast, chorizo sausage, basil oil, plum tomatoes, minus the red onion and jack cheese.  Pizza was good, not great but good.  Next time I will probably try the Buffalo & Wild Mushroom Meatloaf.   I also had the basket of homemade chips and these would have been a whole lot better if they were served warm."}
{"text":"We loved the old church setting and even though we had an interesting Uber ride out here, we settled in for an excellent meal and awesome beer!  We loved the original pierogis.  We've been to Poland and have had great ones, these were great! Felt like we were in Europe with the good food and good beer! Waitress was awesome and helpful with selections.  If we could give four and a half stars, we would because the hostess was unfriendly."}
{"text":"What a cool place to eat and drink!  My Pittsburgh trip was guided by Yelp, and I ended up at an old Catholic church.... ready to drink a lot of beer.  This website really is useful.  We showed up right in the thick of the Friday dinner rush and had a 30 minute wait.  Our server was very friendly and told us all about the beer and food menus.  If you are feeling like a sandwich instead of an entree, be sure ask for the pub menu.   I got the cuban sandwich, and my wife got the bbq sandwich.  Both were okay, but not great.  The beer was pretty much the same.  I got the hefeweizen (and later on a dunkel) and my wife got one of the beers on special.  Again, it was just okay.  Maybe it was just the night I went, but the beer wasn't that cold at all.  I know a little more than the average bear about beer, and that some beers are meant to be served at certain temperatures.... but it just seemed like it should have been served colder.  Again, maybe it's just me.... maybe I got there right as they tapped a new keg.  Maybe they poured my beer in a glass fresh out of the dishwasher.  I don't know.  The real appeal of this place is the structure housing it.  You sit there catching yourself looking up a lot of times during your meal.  I was struck wondering about the history of the place.  Not when it was built, or anything like that, but of all the weddings, baptisms and funerals had taken place here.  How many joyous and sad times.  So, to recap: Service - Very good, Food - OK, Beer - OK, Location - Great.  Recommend.  You gotta check it out at least once, but I'm not sure how often I would come here."}
{"text":"Let's just throw it out now - if I have guests or friends coming to town, this is the top place on my list. So unique, good food, great beverages, and usually very good service.  I have been here many times, for office parties, and just for snacks. I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table, the food is high end bar food (I mean that in the nicest way) and is well portioned so you are always on the verge of finishing or having a small take-home, and the beers are great with an always available seasonal variety along with the regulars. They have a nice outdoor patio for the good weather seasons.   I guess the only thing that is inconsistent here are the servers - we have usually had above average servers but occasionaly you will get one that feels too busy and is just running the food around such that you may wait on drinks. That is how I would capture our most recent visit - sat in the bar area at a table and the server was friendly at first but eventually had trouble coming back to check on us very often.  Some cool things - they give you samples normally if you want to decide on a drink, and if you want to buy a growler to take home, these are a good deal because they allow for cheap future fill-ups on your next visit."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is one of the reasons I moved to Pittsburgh! Well, not completely true, but it is one of the cool things about Pittsburgh for sure. Church is turning out to be a regular go-to place on Saturday or Sunday afternoons for me, with my wife and/or friends. That time of the day on the weekend it is usually pretty quiet (serene?). It can get extremely busy in the evenings, though. The beers are great, the food is better than you would expect (and in its own right very good), and service is usually good too. I'd say on the food front the pizzas are the best. And stick to the basics (e.g., pepperoni). I've tried their bison burger once and wasn't a fan, though kudos to the kitchen for putting out a medium rare burger that was actually medium rare (I find at a lot of places in Pittsburgh that if you order medium rare you get medium instead).  Go to Church. Enjoy. Repeat."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town friends. Excellent happy hour specials & delicious pizzas. There was a period where service was a bit lacking (waiting over a hour for food) but things seem back to normal now. I've been coming here for over 10 years & overall the service is great and you can't beat the ambiance."}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and had to visit Church Works. It's the most interesting brewery I've been to. The food was good and so was the beer. Worth making a trip to this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times, always thought it was decent beer interesting place but good food.  Just had the worst dining experience, bad service and wrong orders......they did pick up the tab but it was to little to late. Never again."}
{"text":"A+ for decor and ambience. The beer and food falls a bit flat. This is the type of place I take visiting friends to since they are wowed with the setting but wouldn't ever really go to with Pittsburghers. Just underwhelmed with the beer.   Ambience: No brewery in Pittsburgh can compete with this one in this category. When have I ever been in a desanctified church where the pulpit is filled with beer tanks?! Some might find it sacrilegious but most people find it entertaining. Plus they have ample televisions around to keep the sports watchers happy.   Drinks: I've had the Pious Monk Dunkel and the Cherry Quadzilla. I'm a big Belgian beer fan but both really needed some love. The Dunkel is average at best, lacking a complex finish. The quadzilla was probably one of the worst quads I've had. Overpowered with artificial cherry flavoring and similarly simplistic in its flavor profile. Really missed the mark.   Food: The only thing we tried were the pierogi. Over lathered with butter and just like the beers, somewhat bland. It felt like average bar food at best.   Service: No issues on this part but nothing over the top either."}
{"text":"The food is mehhhhhhhhh.  They fall into the typical Pittsburgh habit of just oversizing the proportions and ignoring quality.  The beer is good.  Always good.  Nothing special, but definitely good.  There are plenty of tables and plenty of large tables so you can easily walk in with a group of 12 and be seated without a reservation.  Parking is a challenge, their lot is often full.  The atmosphere is underwhelming especially in spite of the fact that it is in a former church.  The lighting is unintentionally dim and poorly distributed.  Reading the fine print on the menu can be difficult for some, and the food doesn't look particularly appetizing because of the lighting.  In addition the acoustics are a disaster.  Even on a slow day you have to shout to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Delicious beer, great facility, tasty food. Food was a little slow, which was not as much of a problem as it coming out not quite hot. The service was otherwise good. I think maybe they were waiting on my companion's meal to plate while my sweet potato fries got cold."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place -  Great atmosphere, the beer was good (tried two of the seasonals - Belgian black which i really enjoyed, and the absolution ale, which admittedly as someone i was with commented, had an olive-y taste)  Quesadilla i split with the GF was very good.  We stopped here to spend time before the reception of a wedding (having just come from a wedding).    We had a really large group that kept growing and it was no problem at all."}
{"text":"The service is so slow! And not very friendly. Neat concept, but man does service need improvement."}
{"text":"I went to a U.S. Food show at the David L Lawrence convention center the day I ate here so I had been picking at food all day, and wasn't that hungry. We went during happy hour so half off appetizers was a bonus we got the spinach, feta and artichoke dip which was just mediocre nothing to brag about.   We got the Pierogie pizza with onions and it was delicious and service was fast. We took most of it home as we had no appetite. I didn't get a beer but their selection was huge and the atmosphere is so fun. My only complaint is having never been there we had to ask a person outside how we go in because it's not very clear being as its in a church but, I'd most definitely go back and try other yummy options I saw."}
{"text":"Came in for late lunch on a Saturday.  The general consensus from our group is that the food is fine, but not amazing.  Our visit was less than 2 weeks ago and I actually don't even remember what I ate.  The beer was good, and the flight is a generous 8 samples.  The atmosphere is impressive, and it made for a fun, unique place to stop while visiting town."}
{"text":"Okay, so everybody loves this place because it's a brewery IN a CHURCH! OMG. And you should go once so that you can walk in, and say that out loud. But the truth is, the food is not that hot (meaning good, it's plenty warm). The beer is good. And it's a good spot if you are trying to get your entire family into a restaurant, because you can make reservations, and the place is huge (also, there's a parking lot and ample street parking). But there is far better food in Pittsburgh. But look, if you're there--go out to the patio that it seems few people know about, get a pious monk dunkel, and the pierogi pizza. It will be a pleasant evening, and you can say you've been to church that week."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works was awesome! Today was the first time I experienced Church Brew Works and I loved it! A lot of different, fun food and drink options! I love the atmosphere! So cool that it's a restaurant in an old church with original parts from the church. I thought the food was wonderful! However, 1 appetizer and 2 meals came out a little cold. We brought it to the waitress's attention and she notified the manager right away. The manager came over apologized, took my sister's meal off the bill and offered a free dessert! The customer service was great! I definitely will go back here!"}
{"text":"I always respected CBW if only because these guys were way ahead of the craft beer revival.  They opened in 1996. Think about how crappy the beer landscape was back then. Yeah I was like 8 years old but if I had been older I would've been faced with the choice between Bud/Miller/Coors or worse. Penn Brewery (opened 1986!) and this place were pretty much the shining rays of hope in a thoroughly uninteresting universe of beer sameness.   So yeah, having a local spot churning out fresh and creative offerings must have been awesome back then.  But now, I'm sorry to say there's just too much out there that is better and readily available. I find the regular beers here too safe and the more adventurous ones to be unrefined in execution or just bad ideas to start with.    Here's what I do like: the atmosphere, outdoor seating, pizzas, and especially the nontraditional pierogi of the day. This inspired me to do all kinds of crazy stuff to Mrs. T's at home. Just throw anything on, seriously. I have yet to find something that tastes bad...sriracha, frank's red hot, dinosaur bbq, sweat & sour chili from trader joes, a million others, it's impossible to go wrong.   But despite this whole Pierogi Picasso thing it inspired, the focus is still the beers, and until I see some better output I can't imagine returning frequently."}
{"text":"I don't drink. I came with friends. I was vegan at the time. They were very accommodating and helpful while I asked questions about preparations and ingredients. I had a good time and good eats."}
{"text":"The food and service are terrible. Beer and wine is excellent.   Food: tastes terrible, portion size is small and price is very high. We ordered the veggie spaghetti ($17) and buffalo chicken pierogies ($18). Mind you, we are a couple who doesnt mind paying a higher price for a good meal. I originally wanted to try one of their wood fire oven pizzas but the only option was to order a large pizza for $20 which isnt an option for a single person. They do have a lunch portion but i was unable to order ir because they dont serve lunch portions on weekends (it was 1pm on a friday afternoon). It took over 30 mins to get our food and they weren't even busy. Both dishes tasted aweful and we only ate a few bites of each before asking for the check. We told the waiter the food was terrible and that we were leaving hungry and he didn't even apologize or get a manager. When we asked for a manager, we were told there wasn't one available. As 2 people who work in the restaurant industry, this was absolutely appalling to us.  Drinks: the beer and wine is excellent. While waiting for our food, we tried 2 different beers and a reisling, all very good and well priced. Although we did wait a long time for each drink we ordered, we didn't mind so much because they were good.   To conclude this review, we do reccommend trying the beer, which is what they are known for, but definitely don't waste your time or money eating here."}
{"text":"We loved it! Plum tomato pizza was great. Larger than we expected at 10 decent sized slices. Turkey and brie sandwich was also very good. Get the beer sampler and try out a whole buncha different brews.  Overall, prices are pretty reasonable too and this old church is super cool inside!   Great, great stuff!   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What an awesome setting-this used to be an old catholic church that got turned into a restaurant/pub. What an awesome and unique place. Anyway- My compadres weren't so impressed with the beer they ordered. I was! I go the Thunderhop IPA and it was very good and I'd recommend for anyone who likes a good IPA. We ordered a couple apps which were pretty good-spinach dip/chips and perogis. My friend and I then split the wild boar pizza. It was honestly one of the best pizza's I've ever had. All around awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Its a brewery inside a freak'n church...it looks and feels really cool inside, pulling up your thinking, not they didn't, but, uh, yes they did.   The beer is not the greatest but still pretty good, it's worth checking out if your in the city."}
{"text":"i realise that going to a brewery and not having beer is rather tragic, but there you have it.  however, the food and service here are great.  the wood-burning oven produces delicious pizzas, and the pulled-pork sandwich was pretty good too.  the best thing, however, about Church is just that -- it's in an old historic church.  the use of the former sanctuary space as a sprawling restaurant and brewery space is innovative at the very least, and rather brilliant at best (having the tanks in the former apse/ambulatory (i.e. the front) is quite visually entertaining).  the ambiance is definitely unique and makes this a worthwhile dining experience.    (be prepared for a potential wait on weekend nights; reservations are only accepted for parties of 8 or more.)"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time very recently. The space is beautiful and noteworthy in and of itself, so go just for that. So neat. I got a fresh, light, lemony beer--exactly what I wanted on a hot summery Saturday. My burger was nothing special, it was definitely not awful, but I had a hard time remembering what I had gotten and I was there about 2 weeks ago. My nieces had the pierogis and they said they liked them, but they didn't look impressive or homemade to me. And the food is not cheap--you're paying high-end pub food prices. I probably will not return for food."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"check it off the list\" places. Unique atmosphere, yes. Beer was fine. Food was overpriced.  The buffalo chicken pierogies and onion soup were good but the $34 steak and mashed potatoes came out cold and before we were even finished with our soup. The waitress tried to charge us for a drink that I couldn't drink because it didn't come out properly. Not what I'd expect for the prices they were charging."}
{"text":"Amazing spot to roll out your weekends!!  Just the scene of a brewery in a church is out of the blue. Their burgers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Drove to Pittsburgh from Morgantown for a day. Chose Church Brew Works for lunch and wasn't disappointed!   Super cool place. I felt like an annoying tourist taking so many pictures of the establishment and food. I had the lamb meatballs as an appetizer, shrimp and grits  for lunch, and the stout to drink. My pal got the salmon accompanied by polenta and some sort of chutney (I liked my meal more). The presentation was beautiful and the food tasted great! I wasn't as impressed with the beer selection though. I asked the waitress about the establishment and the beer and she couldn't answer my questions, but she was was attentive and friendly.   I would definitely come back with a group and to try the different food specials. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"The food is good ... onion soup is great.  Came here with family ...unable to be seated in dining area cane to bar side...not sure why as it was not busy.  Service was subpar. Waitress forgot items.  We didn't get utensils or plates for appetizers until it was nearly cold. Food is worth coming back for tho"}
{"text":"Great Concept, Good Beer but there was nothing making want to go more than once"}
{"text":"Rides on it's schtick! Many better choices in the burg!  I cannot for the life of me understand how this place keeps going. I suppose it's the hype that is made for the tourists that pour in. I think the food is bar food and the beer has some serious challengers in the Pittsburgh arena. Craft Beer is a industry in this town and you can't take it sitting down if you want to keep head and shoulders above the crowd.  I'm not a fan...try harder"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  The pros:  Very pretty, beer is good, relatively inexpensive.  The cons:  Food is absolutely terrible.  In two trips, they served tasteless philly cheese steak (how is that even possible), and a quesadilla that was cold.  When I returned it to the waiter, they brought it back two minutes later, they had evidently just thrown it into the microwave.  Also the food took  more than an hour to arrive.  I will only go here if a group of friends forces me to go, and even then I will only drink.  Please don't bother taking anyone here for dinner."}
{"text":"Good beers, gorgeous surroundings, super cool idea (brewery in a church? Neat!), good food.  There are 2 menus for dinner: the pub menu, for eating at the bar, and the fancier dinner menu. Two people before tip easily ran up a $100 bill with an appetizer, two entrees (nice steaks!) and 2 beers each. Worth it for a special night out (anniversary, etc.). The pub menu is also solid and has standard pub fare - sandwiches, fries. I look forward to eating here the next time I visit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"-What is there to say about this place...it's a brewery built inside of an old church. This place is HUGE! So much space and the bar itself is just massive.  Depending on the time of day, you may get a strong yeast smell which doesn't make everyone in your party happy.  -I got the sampler of course, not much to say all the beers were good none stood out as AMAZING.  I actually preferred their pale ale over their IPA. But the sampler is worth trying.  -The pizza is fantastic, I've been twice and both times enjoyed it very much.  -All in all if you are in the area check this place out, it's got good food, good beer and just the scenery is fantastic"}
{"text":"It is worth the visit just for the historic church structure alone.  The service was terrific, but the food and drink varied.  They were out of the a lot of home brews (this is to be expected).  My friend's pasta was overly salty.  Try the cactus and rattlesnake pierogies over the usual ones.  They are tastier!  My cole slaw side sat in a watery sea of mayonnaise.  But the surroundings were awesome!  See it even if you just sit at the bar for a brew."}
{"text":"I had gone to Church Brew about 6 years ago last time in Pittsburgh. The brew is awesome! They make some good in-house beer. The appetizers with the pirogies and the pizza roll options are real nice and tasty. And they have a decent bar menu to choose from. But their main menu of items left something to be desired. The options weren't great. I had the bison meat loaf one day and lamb bolognese pasta another day. Both very average and pricey. The look of the church is beautiful and you're gonna go here more for the beer and ambiance than you will for the food."}
{"text":"Arguably, the Church Works has the best atmosphere I've ever encountered in a restaurant, as their location inside an old church is certainly unique.  With a pizza oven and a brewery near the old altar, it almost feels sacrilegious eating there.  But in a good way.    Food wise, The Church Works is pretty good, with large portions, and a big and diverse menu.  Their pizza is probably their best dish.   If you're ever in Pittsburgh, definitely stop by, as it's one of the few places I've encountered where you can sin and eat at the same time."}
{"text":"not to be a pooper, but this place was not all it was cracked up to be. the ambiance is fantastic. i mean come one, a brew/pub in a church?? who wouldn't love that? (cept for those ... well you know...). the beer was good, but i thought the food was way too overpriced for what it was. maybe it was the nausea and lightheadedness from several days of long hours in a studio... but shoudln't that make food and beer extra tasty?  overall, i'm glad i didn't miss it, but i don't think i would ever go back."}
{"text":"Heard about this place.  Punched it in on my Nuvi.  Cool lay out.   I love the way yet converted this church into a brew fest.  Great atmosphere but our waiter was absolutely no help picking a beer.  There goes his tip.....fun to visit.  Food was good but am little pricy.  Nice to visit.  I give it this place B+  cause of the waiter.  Must see place in Pitt."}
{"text":"The building is the best part about this restaurant. It's beautiful, and the best use of a church that I've ever seen. The beer is average - definitely nothing to rave about. The staff isn't the friendliest. It was completely dead when I was there, and they barely paid attention to us."}
{"text":"Just OK is as much as I can say.  I don't actually drink, but I do know that this place has a good variety of beers, particularly microbrews that are either created on site or bought from an external source. I think the atmosphere of the restaurant is great for kicking back with a good group of friends over a beverage and maybe getting a bit of pretzel or salad, but that's as far as it goes for me, kids.  As a pizza fanatic, this place did not even blip on my radar of what I would call real pizza. Their pie has all of the markings of any overwrought craft in that the end result is not a celebration of the magical composition of perfect components in harmony. Instead, flavors are contorted, ingredients masked, and mediocrity served. Having grown up in a family that (in addition to pizza) also makes pierogis from scratch, I found their version very fair to midland--just passing. The problem I guess for me is that a regular potato pierogi should not give one heartburn, which I took as a sign of too much grease used in the cooking.   Although the restaurant does provide a nice atmosphere to gather a group, I must add that the last time I met some friends there it smelled keenly of petting zoo. We figured that it must have been one of the grain ingredients for the beer, but it was STRONG. Try at your own risk. :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to come or a meal when visiting Pittsburgh.  It's an old church converted as a bar and restaurant with excellent stained glass windows. The food and service was very good. I would recommend visiting as a unique experience to top off your visit to Pittsburgh. A wide variety of beers to choose from and good food.  Parking is located behind the school which is closed and part of brew works,"}
{"text":"A brewery that used to be a church? Does it get any better than this? They brew the beer right where the altar was. It's pretty neat inside. Still churchy, stained glass windows, etc. Once or twice when I went it was a little humid and smelled a little...funky, but it IS a brewery. It's nothing overwhelming that made me have to leave though. To be honest I don't care for their beer too much, it's more of the idea of this place that I love. But the food IS good, I'll give them that.  I would try to go for lunch instead of dinner, because the prices are much higher after 4pm. It's definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I gave Church Brew Works a star for the novelty of having a brewery in a church and a star for their pizzas. Besides that I haven't been too impressed with their food and beer. It's a cool place to take someone whos from out of town, but don't go expecting a culinary experience."}
{"text":"To start with the positive: the concept is really cool and unique, also a great historical remnant of early 20th century Pittsburgh. This tasteful re-appropriation of a typical old church maintains all of the original design but cleverly incorporates brewery equipment. The beer is decent, as is the pizza.  On the other hand, this place really feels like a tourist trap when you compare the prices to the quality of the food. $17 for room-temperature pierogies is literally insane. For $12-$40 per person on entrees alone, you are better off going to a much better restaurant that actually feels upscale. Every time I've been there, they seem to be out of the beer I want... they are also seriously lacking in wheat beers and vegetarian options.  Like any touristy establishment that feels it can get by on \"cool\" factor alone, this really feels like theme park-level rip-off."}
{"text":"I love Church Brew Works and come here often. They have some great brews and some not so great brews, but they have something for everyone. Their best brews (in my opinion) are the Belgian Tripel, the Mole Stout, the Coconut Stout, and the Dunkel.   I've only eaten off of the bar menu, but I find the food to be consistently good. The pizzas are especially excellent.   The service is sometimes spotty, but the servers are doing the best they can and are good about communicating about delays. There is one bartender who is kind of a jerk.  The ambiance is great. It's a stunning location that was the neighborhood's Catholic church for years. The stained glass windows are especially great. For those of you complaining about the smell - it's a brewery! That's what it smells like when they are brewing.   My only complaint is that they sometimes close early at night depending on the crowd.  The takeaway growlers are a great value."}
{"text":"First of all, you fixed church! Thanks for making the church complete by offering brewsky to yinzers! The food menu here is seasonal. Overall, I enjoy the experience of coming to eat here. I like taking friends to this place. I think it is unique with decent food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting but mediocre beer.  Come for the lovely place,  stay for the people watching. Drink elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decommissioned churches can become the most amazing things, and in this case, it's a large brewery and restaurant.  Super cool interior aside, the service and food here are also top notch.  Onion soup: very savory and cheesy Spinach Caesar salad: quite good! The spinach adds an unexpected depth and deliciousness Veggie spaghetti: one of the best dishes of the night Brewmisu: incredibly good dessert, and eaten in a flash  If I'm ever in the Pittsburg area, this is one of the first places I'm coming back to."}
{"text":"Ok, so you come here for the experience. You're in a brewery in a freakin' church. It's pretty awesome. The brew house is on the altar. The pews have been replaced by tables. And you're drinking pretty good beer staring at gorgeous stained glass windows.   The beers were all very... fine. I wanted a sampler, but stopped myself from getting the 8-beer flight they typically offer and got 4 a la carte sample pours of some of their higher ranked and higher abv brews. To accompany I simply got a cup of the french onion soup, which was really good (and hot, I about burned my tongue and nearly couldn't taste the beer). But, honestly, they could be serving Bud Light (which would be the ultimate sacrilegious experience) and to see what they've done with the place would be worth the $5 Uber ride from downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just so perfect in a novelty sort of way.   \"Let's go get sloshed at a church?\" \"Great idea!!\"  The pizza was great and big enough for two with an appetizer, and dessert was't memorable, but the whole concept of this place just makes me happy.   Our waiter was easy on the eyes too, that might have helped. Drinking and flirting at church, who knew :)"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars for the really cool building and the beer. The food, horrible! We did a beer flight so we could taste several different beers, my favorite by far was the stout. Full of flavors of chocolate and cofee, loved it! The building is really cool, great old church converted into a brewery and restaurant. The food was really bad. We ordered the perogi's to start off, they tasted like the frozen ones you get at the grocery store. Two of us ordered the wood fire oven pizza, both were horrible. no taste at all. I can't recommend the food but I would say worth a visit to see the place and taste the beer."}
{"text":"It's not worth the wait. I don't know why people always say to go here. The food isn't very good (although I've heard the pizzas are decent and I haven't had one). Last time I was there it was later in the evening and there was a mouse running around our section. I think mice are cute, but not in a restaurant. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"As a conference attendee who goes to Pittsburgh once a decade, it was fun to find this local gem that was admittedly a little far flung from the tourists in Oakland and the greater downtown area.   The restaurant is in a beautiful old church, and it has been restored and repurposed nicely to reflect a casual atmosphere. We got there at 5 on wednesday, and it was dead until about 7 when a bunch of people came in. I got the sampler, which is a LOT of beer. 8 small 4(?) oz glasses of local brew are put in front of you, though the names are hard to remember and the waitress went over them too quickly.   Decent food, your typical pub food. The ambiance is really what this location is all about. I would return again for drinks and snacks only, I think."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. The food is a little pricey but very good."}
{"text":"The location of the Church Brew Works is amazing but it's very loud.  The beers are great but the food is kinda meh.  If I go back, I would go only for beers and appetizers."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. I especially liked the pizza. I know they no longer have a pizza oven, but I've always liked the atmosphere so we went anyway.  The menu items we ordered tonight were absolutely terrible. They have very few vegetarian options on the menu. I remember they had better choices in the past. We both ordered the chick pea salad sandwich due to the very limited menu selection.  We discussed leaving before we ordered but were hungry so we stayed and hoped for the best. It was just awful. We each choked down about half of our sandwich. I didn't think chick peas could be ruined. I was wrong. I still feel sick from eating this. The waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever!  The one star is because I love the old church.  We have been there several times and today took out of town guests.    I was not expecting haute cuisine, just a burger and a beer, but will never go back.  Service was slow, menu confusion resulted in a need to place orders twice, entrees arrived after more than an hour and a half missing ingredients, with the wrong toppings and condiments, not at all as ordered and lukewarm at best.  We were embarrassed in front of our guests and nobody who worked there much cared about the terrible service and lousy food.  Skip this one!"}
{"text":"The location would sell the place even if the food and beer were only OK.  The former church is an amazing place to visit in its own right.  Fortunately, the beer and food stand up equally well and made for a tremendously enjoyable evening.  We were in town for a pre-Christmas get away and went to CBW for dinner on a Wednesday night.  We feared the worst when we pulled into the side street and the their lot to see it quite full and figured that were in for a wait inside.  Thankfully, our concerns were unfounded as the place was busy but not crowded.  We sat on the \"pub\" side to the left of the aisle.  Our server arrived promptly with drink menus and quickly gave excellent descriptions of all of their seasonal beers.  I go to a lot of brewery restaurants and one of my biggest peeves are servers who have no clue about the product that they are trying to sell.  It was a pleasure to hear someone enthusiastically describe their beers.  I settled on the Mexican Mole Stout.  It was peppery and complex yet really balanced and enjoyable.  It didn't feel \"contrived\" like many infused beers.  After that, I went on to the barleywine ad have to say it was excellent as well with lots of alcohol warmth, complex malt tastes and very nice notes of the bourbon aging.  My wife enjoyed the SteamHammer very much.  As an appetizer, we couldn't turn down the fired risotto balls.  They were a wonderful treat and I'm going to try to replicate this recipe.  For dinner we settled on the portabello mushroom pizza and it was equally good and adequately portioned.  Highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the top 10 microbreweries in the US, and its a great place to go even IF beer isn't your thing.  All kinds of creative different kinds of pizza and Pittsburgh favorite dishes--all really tasty.  And the atmosphere is awesome.  It's such a gorgeous space to eat a meal."}
{"text":"We were confused on where to enter because it was actually a church.  Its been a while since i had to call the place and ask where the front door was.  Even with the call, I was still confused.  So I went to the building that looked like a church, and went inside.  Then boom, beer flowing the rooftops...ok that's an imagination that I have.  We went down the middle aisle and seated half day the church.  There was beer filters, bars, tables, and tvs.  I wasn't sure if it was blasphemous or simply a restaurant that was renovated in a church.  That's exactly how it is.  Interesting and eerie with a twist of humor.    I ordered the Cod Fish Sandwich which I imagined to be small for only $10.00.  The fish was a bit dry, mainly because I didn't  put any type of dressing on it, so that's my fault.  I don't drink beer...or try not to, so I can't really tell you about the beer.  My coworker liked it.  He had like 10 glasses.  Alki!  service is ok."}
{"text":"We were seated right inside the door, where the hostesses placed the menus. She would walk up a plop ten to fifteen menus onto the table. Robles was that when she did this it slammed into our seating and dislodged us. VERY RUDE.  Never returning."}
{"text":"After starting a new job about 2 weeks ago, my supervisor thought it would be a good idea to go out for a bite to eat and a few beers, as part of my introduction to Pittsburgh and as a way to build some rapport outside of the office.  He suggested the Church Brew Works as the venue, with the caveat that he has found their beers to be rather uneven, their food to be suitable, and the location to be quite remarkable.  I had heard about the Church Brew Works before, and I was eager to try out this restaurant.  My supervisor was correct when it comes to the beer.  I had a pint of the Heavenly Hefe Weizen, which I found to be rather mediocre.  It was a bit watery for my taste, and there was a flavor I couldn't pick out that seemed a bit off.  For our second round, we chose the Pipe Organ Pale Ale.  This brew had an assertive hoppy essence that was quite enjoyable.  It was pleasantly bitter, and definitely the better of the two beers that I tried.  Compared to other pale ales, though, it was simply OK.  We split the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza, which was quite good.  The crust acquired a nice flavor in the brick oven and was crispy.  Toppings were fresh, although I found the grilled chicken to be underseasoned and the chorizo to be a bit bland as well.  I was expecting a spicier sausage.  On the whole, though, the pizza was good.  It was the perfect amount of food for two strapping young men to share.  At $15.50, I thought the price was fair for the amount and quality of food.  The real star at the Church Brew Works is the building.  It is clearly a unique setting, and it was a lot of fun to enjoy a few beers at this location.  For a Wednesday evening, it was quite busy so they have clearly built up a following.  I would certainly return, in search of a better beer from their selection."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not phenomenal.  If you are hungry and want big portions for good, standard, american food, then this is a good place for you. The fact that this used to be a church does give points to the rating. But, this is the ONLY unique thing about this restaurant- the building. Food is good, but not unique.   I am also not a biggest fan of their beer- They serve very German-ish beers. No IPAs, sours, etc. However, this does not take off starts on my rating, since this is my personal preference."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Came here for lunch with a few people I work with.  I was immediately impressed with the place, the atmosphere was great.  All of the foods that our server talked about sounded great.  My co-workers ordered the pulled pork sandwich, the bison burger, and the pierogies, which were all met with rave reviews.  I hadn't been feeling all that great, so I wanted something a bit lighter and ordered the roasted beet and goat cheese salad, which was also fantastic.  I wish I could have ordered some of the beer, but I had to go to work a few hours after eating the lunch, and therefore was unable.  Next time I'm in PIT, that's exactly what I'll do though."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring visitors from out of town.  The ambiance is most excellent and the food is not too bad.    I like the lunch menu better than the dinner menu.  Lunch is a bit more affordable and they usually have some interesting specials on the menu.   I'm not much of a beer connoisseur, so I can't review that end.  However, I am surprised that they do not have bigger tv's in the bar area.  I was once there during a Steelers game and could hardly see the screen from the dining room!  They also have a few good vegetarian options as well, with a more vegetarian friendly lunch menu than dinner."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and helpful staff started out a good lunch. The brews were good and creative. We started with a crab dip, the only disappointment of the experience. I had a Banh Mi Steak sandwich. Good beef with a nice mix of onions, pepper and sriracha mayo for a very, very good sandwich. My wife had the Buffalo Chicken Pierogi, it was excellent.   This is a don't miss near the strip."}
{"text":"Came here for beer and to taste the wood fired pizza. We were impressed seeing the wood stacks and what appeared to be a chef/cook picking fresh herbs, but then...... We asked for samples of beer which your only allowed (2) mmmmmmmmm they have (9) beers on draft but you can only sample (2) we tried a couple and not too impressed with any but settled in the pale ale and then ordered their take on a margherita pizza, it looked like a traditional oven cooked fast food pizza, but it actually tasted worse, so disappointed, looking over the menu it appeared this place has something amazing to offer but they did not. The dough was like eating cardboard, just awful, like frozen pizza that was burnt on your home broiler and then a week old!! This place has ambiance and everything in place to be amazing but someone needs to take control and make that happen. Ordered the Gouda Grits after sending the pizza back. They were chunky and some under cooked areas and made me think they were reheated. Not creamy at all. Flavor was ok tho. My friends ordered a pepperoni pizza. It was drowning in grease. Pic attached."}
{"text":"The food here is probably 2/5 stars, but the view is amazing.  Maybe it's just because I'm new to the Burgh, but how cool is it to walk in to a church and see the light gleaming in from the stained glass and landing on half a dozen polished brew tanks?  It feels so wrong, but looks so cool!  I would definitely come back here to show visiting family and friends...probably not on my own though--at least for the food."}
{"text":"I've been to lunch and dinner here and I quite like it .The setting is marvelous ,there is parking in the back and the beer is good if not outstanding.I like the food , in particular the pizza.I do suspect you need to show a little care when ordering because while I've always liked what I ordered here you could probably hit some loosers.Any way if you're in the wonderful and still underrated City of Pittsburgh,this is a must."}
{"text":"I like Church Brew Works and I would go again in a heartbeat.  If I want to be 100% honest, I would say their food is not the best. It's not bad, but it's not spectacular, it's just OK.  BUT, they more than make up with the breathtakingly beautiful location, the selection of beers, and the friendly service.  Even after the kitchen screwed up my friend's order twice, they still get a thumbs up for service, it was that good.  I got the flight, and I found a few beers that I fell in love with, and bought a growler.  A great place to visit when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and atmosphere.  Their beer sucks there is really no other way to say it- I just do not like it.  Since they brew their own you may want to try it I recommend the sampler so you can get a small taste of each beer.  Love the atmosphere and great for large parties. An old church turned into a brewery neat concept and great place to take out of town guests.  You can sit in the bar and order off the pub menu or the dining room which has a more upscale dining menu. I always ask for the pub menu as it has the pizzas and sandwiches on it.  Recommend the pizzas which they cook in their brick oven. You can't go wrong with the pierogi pizza and they also offer their homemade pierogis as an appetizer.  The pulled pork and turkey with brie sandwiches I also recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant is gorgeous and you've got to go at least once during your time in Pittsburgh. My husband and I were happy to have been seated quickly on a busy Saturday night. But that didn't make up for the very long wait to receive water, then beer, and then nearly forty-five minutes for an appetizer, at which point we left. It's a loud environment and not particularly intimate, if that's your thing. Great for groups, good beers. Food, so-so."}
{"text":"Decided to come here instead of our regular Rock Bottom. They have no wheat base beer. Beer is ok, Dunkel slightly ok. I had an expensive meatloaf dinner entre, smaller portion and slightly better than what eat'n'park serves. The server was not interested much in waiting. I would suggest Rock Bottom to people any day."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Good unique selection of beers.  Have been here several times. They have delicious pizzas. However, order pizzas during the weekend if you are in by around 6 or are prepared to wait at least an hour.  No, not complaining definitely. Forgot to add their waiters are very courteous too."}
{"text":"One of the more interesting places I've ever eaten.  Was out of the way from downtown but well worth checking out just for the chance to hang out in an old world style church that was turned into a brewery.    Good range of beers all made in house.  Try the cherry beer if you like your beers really strong.  Overall a really cool place but I had to take a star off because the pizza oven was broken, and I wanted to try the pizza there.  Ended up with bbq flavored pierogies which actually worked pretty well."}
{"text":"I give them an A on creativity and a C on execution. The hall seemed more like a cafeteria then a restaurant. There is little privacy and too much reverberation. The beer is really good which wins most of the stars. The pierogies..., let's just say that they were hard to finish. This is a great place for a tourist but not a local favorite."}
{"text":"If you want to see a Roman Catholic Church turned brewery, then this is your place. There's seating for two up to big groups, and the ambience is positive and energetic. The beer menu is extensive. The food portions are a bit pricey for the size; the food was decent. I would only come back to show someone new to the joint."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents a couple of weeks ago. The beer is awesome with lots of selection and good prices for being something with more character than your Bud Light or Miller Lite.   We were there on a Saturday night but the service was good and our server gave us just the right amount of attention. Enjoyed the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Short and sweet: Go enjoy a brew and order the buffalo cauliflower.   For those detail oriented yelpers: My sister and I need food before our next city. We had extra time to kill so we ended up here after a recommendation by a friend. We have a church to brewery in Indianapolis, let's just say it does not compare!   The entrance to this place is almost like a stop and pause moment. The architecture in the building is still so beautiful! They kept so much of the original features that is truly makes it a one of a kind place.   The beer I ordered wasn't my favorite, but I'm not basing any of my review off of that. It was a time where I thought I liked pumpkin, ordered a pumpkin stout and could not drink it. The buffalo cauliflower is hands down the best buffalo item I've ever had. I crave buffalo sauce in everything imaginable and that hit the spot!   The service was great while we were there! We did notice the manager scold our waitress for texting in the bathroom. It was a little odd to hear the conversation but she was doing a fab job so it didn't really matter.   PARKING! Free parking behind the building   Next time: Order buffalo cauliflower, no blue cheese, add side of ranch. Of course don't make the mistake of ordering a pumpkin stout again."}
{"text":"it's the typical looking church but with big beer tanks on the alter.  i was unaware of the outside seating so we made our way to the bar area and grabbed a bar table.  the service was a little slow and it was dead in here for a friday night.  we grubbed on a pepperoni pizza and some beer.  neither were amazing and the place was a little pricey for a pittsburgh joint.  it's worth a stop in to just check it out.  will it be a favorite of mine for years to come?  naaaaaaaa."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of unique food but let me tell you... Best pizza in the burgh. I accidently found this out last night. Little pricey but great historic landmark."}
{"text":"Very cool little venue. The food is a bit pricey but the beer selection isn't half bad. A bit drafty inside since its an old church but I was fine with it.   Their menu options seem to have expanded to be a bit more experimental. Like it.   Definitely not going to find traditional \"bar food\" here - but they do serve refreshing twists on some Burgh favorites."}
{"text":"On a weekend trip to PA, we spent a day at Kennywood and then headed to Liberty Ave and the Church Brew Works. My sister and her boyfriend had taken my folks a while back and we had heard about this old Catholic church that had been converted into a brew pub and restaurant. So a day at the amusement park required a good, cold beer to close things out.   Now the idea of drinking in a church seems somewhat sacrilegious to one who grew up evangelical Methodist. In my home church, you don't drink - or at least you don't admit to fellow parishioners that you enjoy what Ben Franklin called the \"nectar of the Gods.\" So to walk into a holy cathedral to get our drink on was weird, but I was so glad we went.  The church is huge. This place must give \"overhead\" a run for its money. It's a beautifully maintained church, with much of the decor intact. Pews for bench seating, the altar rail, lights, Windows, no crucifixes, Marys or Saints, thank God - perhaps that would be too much.   The menu was a little foodsy-artsy, but not too expensive (for foodsy-artsy) and it was tasty. I had a turkey & brie sandwich that made me very happy.  I am not a beer connoisseur, so I can't really judge the beer, but I liked mine, Ian liked his, and my sister and Brad (Brad brews his own  award-winning beer) liked theirs, so I'd say that's great.  Why not five stars? Well, I have to say we had the bar menu, which was reasonably priced for the food. The other side of the church was the \"restaurant.\" I think if you charge much more for the same kind of food in this noisy of a place (old churches echo a lot), it would be a bit pricey for what you end up getting.  But for the bar menu and beer - a job well done!"}
{"text":"Definitley worth a visit. The atmosphere is obviously the best part. A brewery! In a church! With the brew kettle on the alter!   We got a flight to taste the different beers, which is a good deal considering the size of the samples.  We each liked about 1/2 the beers we sampled. Only one was unanimously considered bad- the rest were just a personal preference thing.   Food ranged between \"eh, pretty good\" to good.  Pizza- good, but SUPER greasy Alligator plantain pierogi app- best thing we had Meatloaf- pretty good  Bison burger - pretty good  Mashed potatoes and fries - mmm!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times. I really like the atmosphere. Very unique. I am not crazy about the food. It is usually oily and bland."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while in Pittsburgh for the day. Aside from the novelty of a brewery being in a church, the experience was not good. The service was incredibly slow and inattentive. I ordered a $20 \"speciality\" pizza (chicken & sun-dried tomatoes) and was extremely disappointed. It had no flavor. There was no sauce of any kind, the chicken wasn't seasoned, and the so-called sun dried tomatoes were dry and flavorless. After delivering the meals, the server never checked back. Our drinks were refilled as he handed out the checks. The only positive thing I have to say is the bread and garlic herb butter were tasty. Would never go back and quite frankly, wish I hadn't have gone in the first place."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and it has always been a good experience. Every time we come to Pittsburgh, we make it a point to come here for dinner. We usually would get their pizza, but they no longer have pizza. The last time we went, I had the veggie pasta and my husband got the buffalo chicken pierogis. I loved the veggie pasta, it was very flavorful and filled me up, but left me not feeling too full. My husband really enjoyed the pierogis and other family members we were with had them as well and really enjoyed them. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is crazy awesome.. Feels like a church when u walk in... Beer is good nothing crazy.. Service is up and down ... But still don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop...  in a church setting.  Not like hofbrauhaus, however it is still a very nice place to go. The ambience however is kind of odd, but if you like beer, it is worth a trip definitely."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment.   The three of us (me, wife and son) arrived and were seated immediately. This was, by far, the best customer service of the night.   It took a few minutes for our waitress to arrive. \"No big deal.\" I think. The restaurant is busy (but nowhere near full) and its early - we have time.   We decide to put our son's order in immediately. He takes longer to eat and usually requires some coaxing, so I am fine if his meal arrives 10 minutes earlier than mine - it creates a nice buffer for everyone.   A few minutes later my wife and I place our order - soup and pirogies for her, meatloaf for me.  Our beers arrive. Our sons meal arrives. Everything is going smoothly. And then nothing happens. We wait. And wait. And wait. No updates from the server. No checking in. Nothing.   We are pretty patient people. We understand things can get backed up. We try to enjoy our drinks while our son reads his Highlights magazine and chomps on fries (he thought the Mac and Cheese tasted funny - and I agreed). After nearly half an hour my patience is at an end. My child is done eating and starting to get restless and we don't even have soup, let alone entrees. I flag down our waitress and ask if my wife's soup is at least coming soon. She pulls out her notepad and stares at it with wide eyes and rushes off.   By this point the tables around us, who are larger parties and arrived after us, are getting their food. Many of these other tables having ordered the same items we had ordered.   The soup arrives and our waitress tries to leave without a word. When I ask if our food is coming soon she informs me she will find out. \"The kitchen is backed up.\" we are told. (Not too backed up for other people who ordered the exact same things after us?)  Finally our entrees arrive - nearly 45 minutes after our sons. No apologies. No explanation.   At this point I flag down a manager. I don't like talking to managers. I am not a complainer. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but at this point I was extremely frustrated.   But here is where things get truly bizarre. As my wife and I calmly explain our frustration, it becomes clear that the manager is more annoyed with us than anything.  We ask for boxes. We get our check. No words. No acknowledgement.  And because one more dumb thing needs to happen, we find that there is no pen to sign the check - just an eyeliner pen. What is happening!?!?  The manager comped our entrees, which seemed appropriate, but that wasn't the goal. We wanted an apology. We wanted an explanation. If you read any of my reviews, I am generally pretty positive and forgiving - but this was just too much.   Here's the thing: I normally LOVE Church Brew Works. The beer selection is great and the food is really solid.   Tonight's meal was a disaster. The food was good, the service was poor. It makes me sad to say that we won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"What an amazing building. The flight of seven beers was fabulous, 35oz. Glad I shared. Food was amazing. What a great place to stop for a nice night of food, drink and conversation."}
{"text":"In fide vivo Filii Dei, qui dilexit me, et tradidit semetipsum pro me.  My real life is the faith I have in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me. (Galatians 2, 20)  Yes, I had to look that up. I would check with the website before venturing over here, as they have funny hours of open/ closing depending on the day. We were there for Sunday lunch and had a great time. The food was great, everyone loved their brew and I got to revisit my Catholic school past.  The ambiance is absolutely spectacular and the wait staff very attentive.  Also, there is plenty of parking behind the Church, so don't sweat the street parking"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here one night a few years ago.  Our get together here was the last night of my trip, so it has lasted in my mind as a memorable landmark.  At the time I was astonished to see such an interesting setting.  What an amazing place, reminiscent of steam-punk and religious vestibules.  There are organ pipes and pews and there is no place like it in Boston.  So by the end of my little night I was too tired to fight the allure that still today I yearn for.  Church Brew Works is on my must see list for the next trip I take to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Don't come here for Brunch.  They should stick to what they're good at which is beer. They advertise that they serve \"brunch\" however their \"brunch menu\" only had 3 choices which were all sub par, very overpriced, and poorly proportioned. It's really hard to mess up brunch, but they managed to."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars, I would. Tasted 8 of their 10 beers in a sampler and really enjoyed all of them, which is rare. Highlights were the winter Saison (which was not very saison-like- more of a vanilla winter ale) and stout which had a nice smoky flavor. Food was above par for a brewery with good local flavor. I tried the perogies which were great as well as a fairly basic but good turkey, Brie, and cranberry sandwich. Staff was very friendly.The highlight (apart from the beer) was the amazing setting- an old Roman Catholic Church. I am not much for church tourism (as a Jewish girl) but this one is well worth a visit. Formal confessionals now sell merchandise. This place is a must on your visit to Pittsburgh breweries."}
{"text":"This place had it all.  The ambiance was amazing, as it felt as if you were either in Germany at a beergarten or in a church about to go to Sunday Mass.  We chose the beer sampler and it was phenomenal with all the different flavors in front of you.  We chose the chicken wings for an appetizer along with the non traditional pirogues.  The wings were great, but the pirogues left something to be desired.  For the main course, I ordered the cheesesteak, which was one of the best I had ever had.  Overall I would love to go back to this place and try some new beers along with a different meal.  I would give this a 5 for the beer and a 4 for the food."}
{"text":"The architecture is beautiful and the beer is awesome.  Food is good too, just a little over-priced as some others have mentioned.  The huge downfall of this place is the service.  I've been here on multiple occasisions and the staff is always rude and cold.  I'm not sure if it could be because I'm in my young 20's and maybe they are nicer to \"adults\", but never-the-less, service should not be compromised depending on the patron.  They always seem to be in a generally bad mood, and extremely bothered at any simple request like getting me another beer!  I'm sorry I thought that was the main part of your job.  Anyway, I would probably never come back here if the beer wasn't as good as it is and if I wasn't a beer enthusiast, simply because of the terrible service."}
{"text":"Finally, a pilgrimage that makes sense! If church had been like this when I was a kid, I might not have ended up an atheist. Here, the blood of Christ is a luxuriously smooth Porter, his body a crispy-yet-chewy-crusted pizza straight from the oven and his last temptation a S'mores cheesecake with toasted marshmallows. So sidle up to the bar, commit the deadly sin of Gluttony, and do your Hail Marys all from the comfort of your barstool.  This review is an amalgamation of experiences from two visits on consecutive days: 02-27-11 and 02-28-11. The first night I decided to have more bar food type fare. The second I decided to drop my 30 pieces of silver on a few of the fancier items on the menu. I have tried to break up the review into Atmosphere, Beer, and Food ratings, as Church Brew Works seems to fill more than one niche.  The outside of the Church Brew Works remains perhaps unchanged from its original lineage as a church. A tasteful sign with gothic lettering announcing it true purpose is the only hint as to what lies within. The building itself is a gorgeous red brick church with heavy wooden doors.  Stepping through the doorway to the main hall, you're immediately struck by the gorgeous, spacious surroundings. Everything seems as original as possible, from the stained glass windows, to the paint on the weathered walls. The owners seem to have gone to great pains to preserve the condition of the church as much as they possibly could. The bar and much of the seating is made from the original pews; the brass tubes of the pipe organ sit inert and silent on the mezzanine.   Added to the original, traditional accouterment are the latter-day additions: Delicious in their sacrilege, gleaming copper brew tanks occupy the chancel front-and-center, previous home of the altar. Apropos; what better deity for a brewpub? Storage tanks for the final product serry behind the bar; Low half-walls divide the nave into discrete sections without being obtrusive or breaking the flow of the room; a restaurant, like a church, is meant to be a place of gathering, socializing.   As I went during the night time on both visits, I deprived myself of the joy of seeing the refulgency of the stained glass windows lit up by the sun. I can only imagine how gorgeous a dining experience that would have been; light streaming down from backlit iconography onto my food. As it was, I was tantalized by a hint of the possible glory: a rogue streetlight illuminated the face on one of the stained glass windows, perhaps staring at me disapprovingly for drinking in a former house of worship.  As it was, I felt the restaurant was a bit dark. Perhaps the owners could consider installing lights to light the stained glass windows from the outside during the nighttime? Indirect lighting to illuminate the ceiling, especially of the chancel where the brew tanks now sit would give an awe-inspiring sense of vastness to the room. Right now it just seems rather gloomy during the night.  Adtmosphere / Space: An easy five stars out of five. Completely unique surroundings treated respectfully by the renovation. A word of warning: This is not the restaurant to take someone for a quiet, romantic date. This space revels in boisterous celebration and group fun.  As impressive as the space is, we're here to talk about the food, aren't we? Any divine inspiration therein? Deliverance from insipid cuisine? Read on.  I enjoyed two brews at Church Brew Works, polar opposites of one another, and both superb. The Celestial Gold is a very light, hoppy beer. Here in Texas we would refer to it as a 'lawnmower beer'. Effervescent and light on the palette, but with just enough sting from the hops to let you know something is there. Very nice.  The Pepper Porter celebrates the darker forces in the universe. IT is heavy and brooding; decadently smooth with next to no aftertaste, and has very little carbonation, just an ever-so-slight caress of bubbles on the tongue. This porter has replaced Samuel Smith's as my favorite.   Of the limited selections of beer I tried, I felt very happy with them both, and they are in the upper echelon of microbrews I've tried. This is a solid Three-point-seven-five out of Five, but let's round it up to four. If I hadn't been to Portland and immersed myself in the country's finest beer culture, it would have been higher.  Wow I've almost used up my 5000 characters already. Please petition Yelp to allow more.  Pirogi: Excellent, just like great grandmom used to make. Pizza: Chicken and Chorizo. Good but not great. Ice Cream: WONDERFUL malted vanilla with Cinnamon sauce. Some of the best I've had! Buffalo Ribeye: VERY good. The sauteed mushrooms were a highlight.  Overall: I wanted to like the food more than I did. The owners clearly had faith in their space and their beer to bring in the customers, but as we all know, faith without works is dead. A disappointing but still solid three stars out of five. I will go again, but for reasons other than food."}
{"text":"This brewery is a true Pittsburgh gem. It's always a must to bring guests from out of town to see this place. My favorite beer there is the Pipe Organ Pale Ale. It's hoppy but not too hoppy. The other ones I've had are the seasonal stouts and pumpkin beers which weren't that good. They lacked flavor and body and tasted a little watered down. Stick to the regular beers. Food is a little overpriced but if you do get food, try the pierogis or pizzas. Also be prepared that you may have to ask for the pub menu with the pizza and sandwiches on it. I guess they want you to spend more money on their lunch entrees. Don't be fooled - I learned this the hard way. The pierogi pizza is great. Be sure to go between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday for $3 beers during happy hour. I most recently came here on a Saturday at around 3:00 and it wasn't busy at all but service was still really slow. It's also freezing inside. This isn't a place I frequent often except when guests from out of town are here. I still give it four stars though because a brewery in a church is a brilliant idea and their pierogis are delicious."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Pittsburgh this was the first place my friends took me, and I loved it!  It really gave me an awesome first impression of how unique and interesting the 'Burgh really is.  The Church Brew Works is actually an old church-- amazing!  The microbrewing equipment is right on the altar!  So irreverent, much to my delight!  We were seated in a section where I'm sure pews used to be, and had lovely views of the original stained-glass windows and open cathedral architecture.  The beer was really great-- I tried a dark wheat and an amber, both really excellent.  We had pirogies, which seem to be popular around the area, and they were really excellent.  I then moved onto a pasta dish with different veggies in a light tomato sauce which was really great too.  Definitely check this place out!  And Pittsburgh natives, bring your friends here when they come to town!!"}
{"text":"Solely based on the quality of the food and service, I would have given CBW 3 stars; however, it's CBW and a Pittsburgh mainstay (and a great way to introduce family and friends to the city). While at times it's tough to hear your dinner mates because every word bounces and reverberates off of the insides of the church, you tend to forget this while you enjoy the general splendor of it all. I have at times had significant trouble with the service, however the food is pretty good and the beer is better than average- I give the place props for plopping a brewery right in the middle of the church. We call that sticking it to the Man. And I will continue to provide my support."}
{"text":"Great atmoshere, great food. Just walking into the church Brew Works and seeing that they grow their own herbs and tomatoes in their own garden made me think this was Someplace Special. It was. Food was hot tasty and served in reasonable time."}
{"text":"The third piece of the trilogy - read my other reviews - is this microbrewery-turned-church, the last one of my three most favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. With Catholic background and dwindling population and culture, Pittsburgh has lots of old church buildings that are converted into a completely new venue. One of the other places is called Sanctuary, which is a three-story club now, and it's quite awesome inside. This place, when you walk in, imposes the brew house that's sitting where the altar used to be. Above the setup it has a Latin phrase that went something like \"our god, eternal light...\", and the angels flying around in the stained glasses are smiling down on you with bottles in their hands. I don't know what will happen to the religious state of mind if a devout Christian walks in here. Maybe it will explode. But I think it's awesome that instead of tearing this structure down they decided to add a spin to the place and make a great use out of it. It's part of the memory of the community - not that I was part of the specific neighborhood, but still - and you should be able to live with the changing times and at least be thankful that most part of what the church used to be is still providing people shelter and utility.  Anyways, back to more important matters. The setup makes you feel you're at an indoor beer garden. The echoing of chitter-chatters are somewhat unique because there's no church music or bar music playing in the background. So imagine you're a monk and you step into the dining area of your monastry, except you're in the 21st century. Food: excellent, the large pizzas are quite massive and massively tasty so be prepared to share it with at least one other people (two guys should share one, or three girls, or four kids... you get the idea). I think the pizza guy Their other food was also great. Beer: fantastic. The most memorable one was their dark ale, which they roast the malt enough so that the color is darker and the flavor is, duh, roasty, and grainy. I wonder if they sell their bottled beers in other states too. Again, I miss you too. I'll be back someday."}
{"text":"I think half the Yelpers who wrote the reviews of this place only did so just so they could make Catholic church jokes. Stop with the Catholic jokes guys. Nun of them are funny.  See what I did there?  Anyway, I have a confession to make. I haven't stepped into a church for a very very long time. I'm not a church person. What I am is a beer person. That's my holy water, so when I heard of a brewery housed in an old church I had to check it out. This location started out as St. John the Baptist Church  in 1902, and converted in 1996.   First impression, the place is stunning. The former chapel room was magically transformed into a spacious beer hall. The place is HUGE. The interior is definitely worth a look and a photo exhibition. Murals with angels sharing a pint, large copper tanks behind the altar, amazing stained glass.  It was difficult for me to pick a beer I wanted to start with. The beer menu is very IPA laden,so I picked the Nut Brown Stout being a fan of darker beers. This beer completely turned me off to trying any other brew here. It was served warm and it had the appearance and taste of swamp water. I think I made a big mistake and ordered the worst beer on the menu. I had wished I had started with the sampler of eight 5oz pours, just to decipher where this breweries talents lie. It is not with stouts, let me tell you that.  For food, we started with the traditional pierogies. Fantastic. Simple. For our entrees we had the Shrimp and Grits ($23.50)- which were pan sautéed shrimp simmered in a cajun cream sauce. Served with creamy smoked gouda grits and micro greens salad. The shrimp were tiny and not worth the price of the entree. We also had the Shinkasa Cheesesteak ($12) which is the kobe beef cheesesteak. It sounds great on the menu, in person it is overcooked kobe with provolone on a gigantic roll. Looking around me, I think the meatloaf is the item you should order. It was popular and looked appetizing.  The best part of the meal, was the dessert. The brewmisu featuring lady fingers that were dipped into a coffee-wort (wort  is the liquid extracted from the mashing process during the brewing of beer or whisk) reduction and layered with fresh Mascarpone cheese. It was large enough to feed four, and it was so light and moist.   This place should be on your Pittsburgh bucket list, the beer is not my favorite, but doesn't mean this isn't a fun spot to grab a pew and chill with your friends. I would come back for the brewmisu though if I lived here, that could be a bad habit..."}
{"text":"Been several times now. Great service, helpful staff. Try the beer sampler very fun and educational.  Menu is good but not too exciting. The deep fried Brie is excellent for an appetizer.  Large portions at fair prices. Can get a bit noisy when busy.  May not be great for people with small kids.  Too bad the stained glass windows are not lit from the back (outside) would add volumes to the evening dining experience."}
{"text":"We have been going to Church Brew Works, probably since they opened off and on for years.  The beer has always been good, as well as the food.  I always get excited for Oktoberfest and the Wiener Schnitzel Holstein.  Could not wait to get there again this year.  Sorry to say, the cutlet was thick, and overcooked in the deep fryer as were the potato pancakes.  My husband and I still looked forward to the bread pudding for dessert.  It was as dry as the desert!  The waiter was kind enough to take the bread pudding off the bill, but when my husband handed him a $20 and asked for change, he thanked him, did an about face and walked off with a more than generous tip that was not deserved.  Needless to say, this place has turned into a tourist trap that we will never again return.  There are plenty of good food and beer establishments in the area, with much better service."}
{"text":"Wonderful venue full of interest and ambience. Beer sampler of mostly hoppy ipa seasonals and standby offerings is the way to go when you bring out-of-towners to try. Food is good but inconsistent. We have had the gourmet wood fired pizza several times and each time the crust and toppings are coming out under or overcooked and portioned differently. The mussels are perfect each time. But had to request bread to dip in the beer and garlic sauce which is heavenly! Philly Cheesesteak is brimming with steak and goodies. Beet salad is delicious as well although beets not wood fire roasted as claimed on menu. Onion Soup is mouthwatering in aroma and undeniable savory flavor in it's broth and cheese/bread top. The bacon/perogie pizza was doughy, rushed, with undercooked bacon. Food is pricey, more than normal pubs but balances out as you remember you are dining in a unique repurposed landmark."}
{"text":"A church converted into a restaurant, making good use of abandoned pittsburgh real-estate. The beer is amazing, especially the cask-conditioned ale. Over time the food has become quite horrible or I have tired of it, either way it's bad news. The spinach/cheese/artichoke dip is quite good, and the cheese pizza is one of the best I have had, especially after several pints! Basically a good novelty restaurant to take large groups of out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"I couldn't try their beer when we went, so this is more of a review on their food and location.  It's different.  We were visiting and friend brought us here.  The food wasn't anything special (we had sandwiches) but the location was interesting.  Worth a visit. Seating was quick."}
{"text":"This one rates pretty high on my list.....  It has some of the best atmosphere of all time.  Yeah, there are huge beer vats where the alter and crucifix used to be.  The holy water is still there.  You can dine in a pew.  The bar is set up right outside the confessional (remind me to throw in another Act of Contrition, it's only been about 10 years since my last confession).  AND if that's not enough, the beer is actually tasty and the food is surprisingly much more creative than the usual pub fare.  They even throw in a couple of Burgh favorites, like the pierogie.    I really want to go back, but don't have many reasons to venture to Pittsburgh......."}
{"text":"The Church Brew Works is a really cool concept, with an expansive church converted into a brewery, bar, and restaurant. The first time you walk in, the sight is very impressive and also a bit unsettling, with big beer tanks up where the altar used to be. The food is generally quite good, with some dishes better than others. The food is on the pricier side, but is a great deal if you go for Happy Hour. Happy Hour runs until 6:30pm and offers half off appetizers. 2 appetizers are more than a meal, and so it is a great deal when you go that route. The pierogies and bruschetta are amazing. The mushroom and lentils balls are less impressive. We had a great, friendly waiter last time we were there and really enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"The church brew works is that place you take your out of town family member or friend that's never lived in a real big city or seen anything out side of the inside of a TGIFridays/Chilis/Applebees.  It's a great idea, an old church that brew beer and serves food.  The menu is typical of any middle of the road place.  The food is typical of any middle of the road place.  The drinks are fine, but it's not really a mixed drink place... OBVIOUSLY. It's a beer place, and I don't care for beer so I'll refrain from passing judgement on the beer.  The staff is great. Great great great. They have always been friendly and helpful and very kind. The outdoor space is nice and is great on a spring afternoon.  Not all the doors in the front open to enter the space, so be careful and don't walk into one like I did, I'm a klutz. I'd go back if someone REALLY wanted to. There are better spaces for the same thing with (in my opinion) far superior beer/food choices. What can I say I'm a sucker for food trucks and sour brews."}
{"text":"I love to go here on special occasions.  The beer is great and brewed right in front of you where the alter used to be.  The food is good, a tad bit expensive but worth the amount paid.  Can be a bit hard to hear at times due to the openness but o well.  You are there for the atmosphere.    It is a fun place to go and the people that work their are very friendly.  Recommend it to anyone that wants to have a good time at a different style of restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here with a group tonight and had a great experience! The bartender Heather was so kind and sweet and really knew the beers! I started with a flight of 7 beers and it was good. I then ordered some food, as did my friends, and everything was delicious! We were all very impressed with the food! I personally had the pulled pork tostada and a pepperoni pizza. I don't recall what everyone else has but we were all raving about how good the food was!  If you've never been here before, you'll be impressed with how cool the place is. It's a former gigantic church turned into a brewery. It's so neat!"}
{"text":"The Church Brew Works was the first restaurant I was taken to on my first visit to Pittsburgh.  I was immediately inspired by how the original structure was retrofitted to take on the functionality of a brewery/restaurant.  Actually, Pittsburgh does a fantastic job repurposing old and/or historic buildings into new, cool, or trendy sites - such as restaurants, bars, and apartments.  It is something that I love about this city.  Anyway, back to the Church Brew Works - very enjoyable experience.  It is a cool place to take out-of-towners, which explains why my friends saw fit to bring me there.  The atmosphere really does lend to the experience, with the brewing equipment placed at the altar adding to the fun.    Beer: I am tough to please when drinking beer as I have always leaned more toward cocktails, but an ice cold brew after a long day can be very refreshing.  My favorite beer here was the Celestial Gold, with a 4.0 ABV percentage, it goes down very easy and is light enough to enjoy with your meal.  If in season, it is never wrong to go with an Oktoberfest either.  Food: The pierogies - start with the pierogies.  The Traditional Pierogies will hand you a vintage Pittsburgh food experience, plus, anything sauteed in butter can't be bad - right?   My entree from my first visit to the restaurant is no longer on the menu, however I'd recommend the Church Brew Works for beer, appetizers, and atmosphere before moving on to other bars in Lawrenceville or elsewhere.  Though if you come across a chicken sausage sandwich on the menu, I would not pass it up - it is great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Church Brew Works. The atmosphere alone is enough to keep me coming back, and the food is also good! It's loud, so be prepared speak up when chatting with your friends. The acoustics in a beautiful old church will do that - but dining in such a unique environment is worth it.   If you visit you'll notice that the confessional booths have been repurposed, as is the pulpit - which now houses brewing equipment.   The menu is always changing - there are staples of course, but it seems like every time I visit the chef has found a new spin to put on an old favorite. Make sure you ask what the \"Untraditional Pierogi\" is. I've had a few, and I was lucky enough to visit when they had rattle snake pierogis (which were delicious).   Another little known secret is the espresso bar - so if you happen to prefer coffee over beer, grab a shot of espresso! It comes garnished with a little bit of spiralized lemon peel. I'd never had espresso this way, but adding the lemon peel to the espresso was delightful and really brought out some different notes in the espresso that I hadn't tasted before. I definitely will try it this way again!   The pepperoni rolls are also good if you're looking for bar food, as is the Buffalo burger.   Oh, and save room for dessert. The resident pastry chef is extremely talented. I had an AMAZING apfelstrudel (apple strudel) that is possibly one of the best things I've ever tasted. It was a light fluffy puff pastry, perfectly golden brown, with some kind of crumb and apple filling, topped with ice cream and a delicious vanilla sauce. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"What a great concept! I would love to buy an old church and do what they did but kick it up a notch. We weren't too impressed with their food and beer selection. We tried their perogies and didn't really feel like finishing them. I got the beer flight and liked a couple but none really stood out. The place has huge potential and a lot of novelty but it just wasn't what I expected..."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my travels, this place is fantastic! The bartender Chrissy was wonderful and was a nice enough to comp me my drink because my food took a little longer than expected. I had the zucchini noodles with chicken added on top it was delicious. The beer selection is great, I had the blueberry hefe and a pilsner..name escapes me. If you are Pittsburgh this is a good place to stop at! The inside it's absolutely gorgeous with the stain glass windows!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! This place will be common stop every time I'm in Pittsburgh. It's a beautiful old church atmosphere, with a full dining experience. The pierogies were delicious, and the service was superb. I highly recommend stopping in to have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Went here after popapalooza and I was not impressed...the food was meant to be fresh and almost unique and I'll give them that it was.  I ordered the lamb meat balls which were in a red sauce which was good and ricotta cheese which I liked but my girlfriend said was dried out and the lamb meatballs were good until the third one at which time it had a crunch that reminded me of enamel off a plate I could not find what it was but it was gross...I also got the nachos and the pork on the Naxos was really dried out and had an unappealing BBQ sauce flavor and it also had fruit chunks in which gave it a Hawaiian feel but did not go with the dried out pork and horrible BBQ sauce flavor....we also got bison burgers which were also dried out and I did not even get my lettuce and tomato on my bun which was on the menu...I had also asked for mustard and ketchup and they had no yellow mustard just a really spicy one and grey poupon...I won't be coming back...my girlfriend had the pierogis in a cream sauce and she said she loved them but as for the others in the group I can't speak for but they didn't seem impressed...for the price I could have had two meals at a better restaurant...."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff was extremely nice. The brewery is literally located inside an old church which provides a very unique, gothic type of feel. The beer wasn't spectacular but the services was. 3 star for beer + 5 star for service/ambiance = 4 star rating"}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever friends come into town.  The beer is awesome, the food is really good, and the service is typically very good. This is truly one of my favorite places to eat, drink, and be merry in Pittsburgh.  Plus ....turning a church into a brewery is sheer genius."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is always a fun experience. It's really neat to see a restaurant and brewery in what used to be, and still looks pretty much, like a huge church. The beer is decent and the food is good. The couple of times I've been there, the service has been just okay though. The last time I was there with a big group, and I know that's not always what servers like to see coming through the door, I did feel like our server acted a little peeved with us the whole time I were there. But hey, if I worked at a restaurant where the management refused to provide full-time employees with paid sick leave, I might be a little peeved too (looking at you CBW management, I really hate the idea of getting the flu from a someone serving my food who couldn't afford to take and unpaid sick day).  The food is usually pretty good, and the atmosphere is really fun. It's definitely a place you'd enjoy if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Maybe not somewhere I'd make a regular go-to though.  (Seriously management, paid sick days for your employees would be great..think about it!)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor is amazing.  I tried a few of their beers and I recommend the Celestial Gold.  Their food was only average but eating and drinking inside a real former church makes up for that.  Service was also.out of this world.  I visited on a weekday afternoon for a late lunch and had no problems.  The only minor gripe is that its too dark and at the bar there is.no TV or anything.and you are stuck looking at their serving tanks."}
{"text":"First impression, quite an awesome building.   I walked through the front doors of the church (flashbacks/guilt kicked in automatically) to a camera crew. Apparently the Food Network was filming some sort of show because of their pierogies (which is pretty cool).  It was a bit hectic inside so we decided to take advantage of the weather and sit in the courtyard.   The outdoor courtyard was nice and cozy. I have been in better ones but I have definitely been in worse ones.   Food: I got the a Mediterranean salad, although I was a bit hesitant because it was $16 with shrimp.  The old man was footing the bill so I went for it but was a bit underwhelmed when the salad came out.  For $16 I was excepting a Mediterranean island on my plate...but no. My sister got the pierogies which were decent.  They were a bit cold by the time I got to them which was my fault. My dad got a fish sandwich which was the best thing on the table. Crunchy, flakey, moist (eww)   Drinks: Solid beer list but I opted for wine tonight. It was a chilly night so I went with red. One glass of Cab Sav and one glass of Zinfandel. Delish.   Pros: Architecture, Great drink list, outdoor seating, nice but awkward waiter, changing specials  Cons: Strangely expensive for random items, cheesy plastic furniture on patio (really? you spend how much money on redoing the venue but you couldn't throw some wrought iron furniture into the mix), food took a bit but I think that was because of the Food Network event.   Overall: Will go back. I think I will just get some apps and focus more on drinking my meal."}
{"text":"I mean. This is ok. The atmosphere is great, the whole converted church to brewery thing is cool. The food is not vegetarian friendly. Very few options, and really the food is only alright. So go for the beer not the eats."}
{"text":"They should hand you a tunic and a lantern. The space is gothic and massive.   Beers are serious and food is very consistent.   Not all that creative though and slightly pricey."}
{"text":"We were visiting home when we decided to check this place out.  I can't believe that my husband and I never visited while we lived in Pittsburgh!  Church Brew Works is a very cool place with a lot of history. I love that the outside is unassuming and still looks like a church other than the sign in front. Inside is expansive and beautiful. The middle section has plenty of seating and there is a long bar along the left side. If we hadn't eaten right before going there, I would have loved to have tried the food but this trip it was exclusively drinks. The staff was friendly and no one looked at me like the crazy person I was as I looked around at the amazingly detailed art with my mouth agape the entire time. Beers were fresh and delicious and true to their descriptions. Definitely recommend this place to locals and visitors alike!"}
{"text":"(06/14/2011) A great place for visitors and locals alike. I was there with a group of coworkers. The space is amazing, how can you not love a brewery in church?!  Hope your dining companions are not easily offended (the place has been desanctified, BTW).  The beers are robust and flavorful, perhaps a little too much for some (hoppy, malty, yeasty).  The food is good to very good, but not inventive; local takes on your standard bar fare (Pittsburgh-style salad, spinach dip, cheesesteaks, meatloaf).  A couple of nice surprises:  the Untraditional Pierogies, Cajun chicken, mildly spiced; Lemon Scented Quinoa Salad (with Bibb lettuce, cucumbers, red onion, cilantro, peas and lemon-sesame dressing), tart dressing, pungent with ginger, nice crispness from the diced vegetables, great foil for the mild grilled shrimp.  The Shinkasa Cheesesteak (Morgan Ranch Kobe beef, grilled onions and red peppers, and melted provolone on a baked roll) was above average for quality of meat, but just ordinary for a sandwich as a whole; needed some condiment or accent (acid? heat? crispness?).  The Poblano Mac 'n' Cheese was a nice mac 'n' cheese, creamy and cheesy, but only faintly heated by the poblano.  Great atmosphere for groups, service was prompt and civil.  A great time was had by all."}
{"text":"This place has to be home to the worst server in all of Pittsburgh. We were visiting friends in the city for the weekend and they wanted to take us here for lunch before our flight home Monday. The hostess was very sweet and sat us promptly, but it was over 10 minutes before a server came over... As one of us was making his way to ask the hostess about it, our sever came over and asked if we gave our drink order to someone yet. We told her no, that no one had come over yet. She apologized and told us there was a big bereavement party that had her behind. My wife ordered a beer of the beer menu the hostess gave us,  but our server said that wasn't their beer menu, took the menu away and gave us a piece of paper with a few beers on it, what?. After ordering our food and drinks at the same time our appetizers came before our drinks came, then she asked how our app was not even realizing she hadn't brought the drinks yet, then gave us an attitude when we asked. When our food came one of the orders was wrong, and she rolled her eyes at US because either her or the kitchen screwed up. We had to track her down several times for drink refills, and she was just miserable and unpleasant the whole time. When our bill came there was a meal on there we didn't order, we asked her to take it off and she said she couldn't because the managers were in a meeting. I suggested (previously working in restaurants) that she split the bill and put that one a tab by itself and have the manager delete it later, like if the table was getting split checks - she told me she couldn't because the tab was closed out. What?? How was it closed out if we hadn't paid yet? Unless she screwed up and did that by accident. We then explained we had a plane to catch so could she get this done and she said no, they were in a meeting - which wasn't too far from us. We then told her if it wasn't done in 5 minutes we would go into the meeting ourselves and talk to them. Low and behold - a few minutes later we finally had our correct check! We really enjoyed the ambiance of this place, the food was very good as well - but of you get sat with Jonalyn ask for another server! She was horrible."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! My kind of church. The food, the beer, the physical plant. I can truly say it was a religious experience. Repeat after me. Pumpkin Chorizo Fritters. OMG. Manna from Heaven. The beer is solid. A nice variety of styles. Pizza is top notch. I especially like the alter as brew-works. An old RC church, with the original stained glass windows and original pews as the booth seating."}
{"text":"Delicious dunkel"}
{"text":"Long story short: Great beer and food not too bad. Not great but something you taste and be like, oh this isn't half bad but probably will not order again.   Beer: 5 stars. My friend and I got their beer sampler - $12.95 as of 2017! Came in 8 different kinds. My friend loved the IPAs and I loved a pale ale and lager. I wish I wrote the name of the lager because it was something I would drink everyday!   Food: 3 stars. Or maybe 3.5 since 3 sounds too harsh. We got bar foods to go along with the beer: fries, nachos, and pierogis. Foolproof bets for food. But fries were little stale, nachos had a ton of chips and not too much toppings, pierogis were decent but nothing to write home about (I mean pierogis never can be bad. Lk that's their definition almost).   Decor/ambience/etc: THE REASON YOU GO HERE. It's a church. With beer. I think that's the selling point. It's really pretty inside. Worth going when you're in Pittsburgh on a visit."}
{"text":"Excellent beer. Beautiful church. It's definitely a destination worth visiting. Food isn't bad, but I think it tends to be a bit expensive for what you get (but not overly expensive). The acoustics of the church make the restaurant quite loud.  The great beer and atmosphere give this four stars."}
{"text":"Upon walking in the vaulted ceilings, stained glass, and brass brewing machinery really are a beautiful site to see. Like many other reviewers commented - the environment is pretty awesome. The food and service were pretty great--the meatloaf was delicious while the pierogies were only mediocre. Obviously there was a wide selection of self-brewed beers available. While portions were large the food and brews were a bit on the expensive side. Fair warning: When we went they were brewing something and the place had a definite hopps and cabbage smell...a smell that remained on us for a good 2-3 days. Nonetheless I'd recommend this place to anyone in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Worth a stop. The building makes this worth a trip. My beer wasn't very cold and the food was decent. For the area I feel this place is lacking with all the competition. Would I go back? Yes."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular if nothing more than the atmosphere.  I was visiting Pittsburgh with some friends and they recommended this place very highly.  It didn't disappoint.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and we were seated right at our reservation time.  Even though it was a Saturday night and the place was packed, we received amazing service.  I would recommend this establishment to anyone visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Loved the building and the set up here. The food was great and the atmosphere was an added bonus. The service was good as well, but very slow for a Monday. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"My fish was excellent once it was cooked after being sent back twice.   I like sushi, but not when it is still transparent in the middle.   Little disappointed with the menu as well.  I guess had I gone only to drink I may have been happier"}
{"text":"If you have never eaten here, you should go just to see the inside of this old church turned brewery (unless you think that kind of thing is a sin). The place is amazingly beautiful. Even the bathrooms are pretty. The beers are great, some are a little too hoppy for me, but most people like that kind of thing. The pizzas are also great. Most of the entrees I have had could have been better. I would stick to beer and pizza or pierogies here."}
{"text":"Great beers! Mussels were fantastic. Pierogies lacked a bit of flavor. Cheesesteak was okay. Parking is minimum but it's definitely a great experience; they did a beautiful job keeping the traditional and making it their own"}
{"text":"While The Church Brew Works offers a very unique visual aesthetic the sandwiches are only worth the three star review. The experience was pleasant over all but if it's strictly about the food this was a moderate letdown. 3/5 it's worth the visit but there are better options food wise in the surrounding area!"}
{"text":"The interior is gorgeous; a high-ceilinged church with the stained glass and mason work in tact. However, the hummus was just average and both of our side order of fries were SO salty that it honestly made our mouths wrinkly like when you swim in the ocean for an hour; disgusting.  I had the pulled pork and it was dry, so either it was not slow cooked or it was slow cooked and sat as the juices evaporated around it.  It's a shame that such a cool building has such crappy food. Since it's a brewery I kept feeling like they should serve German delicacies but the menu is a hodge podge of pseudo pub food and not very good. A shame."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and architectural features of this building are quite outstanding.  Upon entering you are greeted with vaulting ceilings and sweeping arches.  However, what Brew Works offers in looks, it lacks in service.  The beer selection was outstanding, but it took 20 minutes to get the first round and another 20 minutes for the refill.  After this happened, we politely asked for our bill and took our leave."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works was one of the highlights of my visit in Pittsburgh. The church where they've set up shop is in excellent condition, and the huge amount of space inside is all used effectively.  The entire place was packed when we visited on a Saturday night around 8:00. They had a large number of draft selections in an equally large range of styles, all available in taster flight portions. Our server was quick and attentive, the prices were reasonable, and the overall setting was comfortably between calm and lively.  Parking was easy to find just down the street and we found seats at a table near the bar right away."}
{"text":"Beer in a renovated church is so wrong.. but so fun!  We unintentionally (and luckily) hit happy hour at Church Brews. 4:30 to 6:30pm! We ended up trying quite a few of their happy hour items on their menu.  $1.50 per slice of pepperoni pizza (or cheese)! Tried potato pierogies for the first time in my life! Ate buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing and ranch dressing! And tried their beer sampler! 8 different beers :)  Our waitress was fantastic and the place grew crowded quickly. Good food, good service, and the atmosphere is one of a kind. My pictures say more than my words for this yelp review - be sure to check them out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful...I mean, where else are you going to see beer brewing on an altar, and a bar in the confessionals? The perogies are awesome, and that's high praise from someone from the south who didn't even know what a perogie was till a few months ago."}
{"text":"Let's just say this... you're drinking beer in a church.  Doesn't get much better than that.  The Onion Soup was great as well as the Wild Boar BBQ Pizza.  Can't beat the prices either."}
{"text":"Super fun place everyone should visit at least once.  Their beers were flavorful and not \"hop-y\".  The cheese plate with cured meat is a must. I could have had that as my meal."}
{"text":"Quick update. To be frank, this happened a little while ago. I was just so stunned I couldn't even write it up immediately.  A manager contacted us after we posted our Yelp review and offered us a gift certificate to entice us to give them a second chance (see my previous review for the whole story of how bad the experience was). Nice move! Restaurants should take note that this is the correct practice for \"service recovery\". Unfortunately, they botched their second chance.  The manager recognized us, even though we didn't mention we were there for service recovery. He apologized about our prior bad experience and thanked us for giving them another try. We did not see him again after that.  While we were in the middle of eating our appetizers, our server brought out the entrees again, saying \"I didn't want them to get cold\"! That's the exact same thing that was the problem last time! Are you telling me that you know that we're in there explicitly to give you a second chance because of poor service on our prior visit, at your insistence, and then you go ahead and do the exact same thing that we complained about in the first place? That is the one thing they should have had figured out this time. Also, it's not like we're particularly slow eaters or anything.  They don't seem to understand: the food is going to die on the table just the same as it will die on the pass. The point of coursing a meal is so that we get the entrees at the right temperature when we're ready to eat them. If you don't want the entrees to die, don't fire them so soon. This is basic food service stuff, folks.  It's one thing to botch the coursing once. It's absolutely astonishing that they would do it again after explicitly asking us to give them a second chance for that exact problem. Wow."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works provides a traditional beer hall atmosphere in a transformed church.  For a local craft brewery, Church Brew Works does offer some very tasty options on draft and what I would consider to be the best beer flight in Pittsburgh - in terms of tasting experience.  From a brewery standpoint, Church Brew Works certainly does not disappoint.   From a food perspective, the brewery provides the standard pub options that would be expected.  There aren't many stand out options on the menu, but it is certainly not difficult to find something to hold over ones appetite between pints of the enjoyable craft beer.  The food selection leaves more to be desired, however, the food taste pairs nicely with the beers on tap. This is certainly a location where the drink rules supreme and the food merely follows.  A great location for an evening out with friends or for private events."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works was the first restaurant in Pittsburgh at which I ate. I was going through my soup phase and just had a bowl of the potato leek soup. It was delicious and I've liked Church Brew Works ever since that day.   I am not the world's biggest fan of beer. It's okay, but I've only found one type of beer that I really like (and have only found in one German restaurant in Philadelphia). I'm not going to judge the beer, though my boyfriend and beer-loving friends like the Celestial Gold most of all.   The food is good. Usually I get the pierogie saute, but when I'm feeling like eating a little healthier, I get a salad. The salad is okay, but the pierogie saute started and continues to inspire my love of pierogies. Yum. The ambiance is great. A friend of mine commented that this is the only church in which he prays - a beer hall, to the God of Beers.   I'm not giving Church Brew Works 5 stars because it's not, to me, perfect. It's good, and I've had a number of consistently good meals there, but it's got a long wait, the parking lot sucks, and the salad is good and fresh but not awe inspiring. 4 stars is solid though."}
{"text":"This is a must when visiting Pittsburgh! For one it's a craft brewery in an old church which you won't find anywhere else. Secondly, the beer is delicious. At last, the food is divine! Located in Lawrenceville this brewery and restaurant has amazing food and beer while enjoying the beautiful church. I'm not religious so this doesn't bother me one bit but looking at the other reviews it appears it has bothered some people giving it bad reviews for no reason. People! This was going to get torn down if it weren't for the brewery purchasing it. If you don't like the concept, don't go. Period. Okay rant over! The feta, spinach, Gouda dip is delicious and addicting. The pierogies are scrumptious and I eat these every time. The pizzas are also delicious and if I had to choose one I couldn't they are all good. The beer! Love the pipe organ pale ale! All the other beers are good and you must try them! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this place from other friends so for my Mother's birthday I figured we would give it a try. It was OK. I feel the food is WAY over priced for what you get, not to mention the menu is very small. The beer was alright but our waitress said she was new to Pittsburgh so she forgot some of the references to the beer, and one keg kicked so we weren't able to taste a full sampling. I'm glad we got to experience the place, very cool architecture and great atmosphere but the food was so-so, I feel like there are many other places in Pittsburgh were the food is much better for a lower price."}
{"text":"I have been talking about going here for a few years now. We are somewhere visiting in Pittsburgh every couple of months. Finally made it a stop while visiting at West Penn Hospital.  The Church Brew Works is an amazing establishment. You will just walk around in awe of the structure, the stained glass, and the brewery equipment. Quite a repurposed old church. Have your phone charged because you will likely snap dozens of pictures and selfies throughout the building.  The beers were great. Several craft brews to choose from. A couple of really nice IPAs. They had some stouts and a porter, as well as a few others.  The appetizer that we had was good; pulled pork nachos. But just good, not great.  The sandwiches were just okay. The four of us each had something different. Everyone said the same thing.... it was just okay.  Dessert was not really that good. Tasted like a frozen box cake. No real flavor to it.  So if I were to offer a suggestion, definitely stop by to see the Church Brew Works.  Have a couple of beers, and just have an appetizer or two."}
{"text":"I went to Church on a Sunday.  The Sunday before Labor Day to be specific.  It was packed.    The service was slow and our waitress explained that they were severely understaffed in both the kitchen and the floor.  They didn't expect it to be packed.  I don't know why they weren't prepared, but they weren't.  The server then explained they were out of all pizza, all pierogies, both soups and other stuff.  I thought that was a little ridiculous, but at least they still had beer.  The beer was actually the best part.  I tried a few of the craft beers that are brewed in-house.  Or should I say in-church?  I thought the beer was delicious and had a lot of flavor and variety.  It was very good.  After at least a 1/2 hour wait after ordering the food arrived.  I got a chicken pot pie.  It was chicken, fresh vegetables and gravy covered with a crust.  It was excellent.  The experience was as pleasant as it could be.  I can't blame my server for waiting an hour from sitting to getting our food.  But I can blame the management.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and I'd try this place again when I return to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Really cool space. We only stopped in for a drink so I can't comment on the food, but the beer was good. They offer flights of 8 beers - I don't remember exactly how much it was, but I'm thinking in the $12-15 range, which isn't bad at all, because they were rather large pours. This was enough for my husband and I to split.   The food menu looked good, so I would definitely go back again to check that out."}
{"text":"As far as drinking beer in a beautiful church goes, I give this place 5 stars. The stained glass is gorgeous and the atmosphere is pretty cool. Other than that, the service is just ok, beer is ok, and the food wasn't so great. My salad was a bit messy, and my boyfriend's chicken sandwich was extremely undercooked. If you're hungry, I would go elsewhere to eat, but if you're just stopping in for a beer it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"4 stars for the building: How cool is it to have a church for beer, with a big primary fermenter in the choir area?  (I didn't go over and check it out, but I think that's what it was.)  Only downside is that they did very little in the way of sound design, so you're surrounded by a constant roar with even a moderate crowd - not good for conversation.  2 stars for everything else:  Beer's really not that good.  It tastes like they're rushing it - the alcohol and sweetness taste like homebrew that I open too soon, before all the flavors have settled down and the more complex ones have developed.  It makes sense to do this as a small, maybe undercapitalized, brewer, because those tanks represent a couple of thousands of dollars of malt and hops.  Best to start getting a return on them ASAP instead of keeping them stored away for a couple of weeks to finish up.  (I've tried several, but their bottled stuff comes across the same way.)  Food is all over the place.  The $9 fish sandwich is a thin slab of freezer cod fried and served on a 12\" grocery store Italian loaf with no toppings at all, and I had to ask for an extra sauce cup of Tartar sauce to have enough for any semblance of flavor.  (This was the first time in a long while that I've left food on my plate.  Granted, it was a lot of bread, but I wasn't full: I just didn't want to swallow any more of the sandwich.)  Sweet potato fries were okay, but my friend's French onion soup was actually pretty good.  Service was par - nothing special, but no complaints.  Last upside is that they do take credit cards, which is, unfortunately, not a given in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Really cool place. The minute you walk thru the doors you can't miss the brewing equipment where the altar use to be. Really wide selection of beers and got to taste 3 different ones and they all had great taste.  We had the Buffalo Cauliflower and it was fantastic.  I tried the Bah Mi Steak sandwich and it had a great flavor and was a very unique taste. Really like it."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. It's a great place to bring out-of-town guests because the menu would please anyone but also has Pittsburgh-related items like pierogis. Locals love this place. It's huge and always packed with people. The beer is fantastic but they have a full bar so you can order whatever you'd like.  I usually get something fun off their special menu, they sometimes have some interesting pierogis."}
{"text":"The environment was very untraditional since its a vacated church. The food options were a good reflection of what's popular in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Pot Pie, which was good. However, I wasn't particularly impressed with the food."}
{"text":"First timer at The Church Brew Works, and I was disappointed to say the least.  To begin, the building is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! But for some reason, they felt the need to hang tacky, poorly designed flags everywhere which so cheapened the ambiance.  We ordered 3 different types of beer: the Octoberfest, the Oatmeal Stout, and the Brett Ambrosia. The beer menu is confusing and not helpful. The seasonal beers were not described at all, and some of the normal beers had \"if available\" after them. - note that I got the Octoberfest after being told their trippel was not on tap, and my dad chose the oatmeal stout after being told that they were out of the seasonal coconut bourbon stout. You are a brewery, & this is not okay in my book.  The beer was not terrible, but not fantastic. Nothing I would ever order again. The stout was not complex or full bodied at all. The Octoberfest was also fairly bland and forgettable, in my opinion. I'm not a fan of bretts, but you might like it if you are.  The service was terrible. The waitress seemed clueless and awkward. She answered with an \"I don't know,\" more than once with no offer to try to answer questions, had no idea items were unavailable until after we had ordered them, and was incredibly unprofessional. If she was new, I could've looked past this, but she made no mention of being a new hire.  Finalllyyy... The menus and food. The menus are awful. Very poorly designed and so confusing. The pages are falling out and the books are tattered. As far as I'm concerned, if you're charging $20+ for entrees like pasta, this is unacceptable. The choices on the menu had no rhyme or reason. Half were Italian and half were German, with a sprinkle of whatever else.  The food was mediocre. We only got a few small things because it didn't seem worth the money, and the service had us wanting to run out the door. The spinach smoked Gouda dip was okay, but nothing incredibly memorable. The German potato salad was decent, and the soup was alright. Prices were way too high, in my opinion, for what they were serving, especially when they seemed to not be able to get much else right.  Overall, I was sad when leaving. This is such an incredible location with an amazing ambiance, but they killed it for me. Bad service, mediocre beer, and overpriced food made me not care if I ever came back. Wasted potential."}
{"text":"This is the best brewery that I've been to in the USA. Plus the customer service is great and the food! You have to try it yourself. 1 word AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and good food. Cool atmosphere as a retired church. If they could limit the acoustic echo it would improve the experience."}
{"text":"This place is great! Excellent atmosphere (it's so unique, you simply MUST try it), great beer choices (awesome sampler), cool food choices (and everything we had was good, not 5-star dining [come on, this is a beer pub], but definitely GOOD).  Our waiter was attentive and the musicians in the kilts with the accordions were darn entertaining (especially singing happy birthday to the entire venue)!  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and even took home some souvenirs.  We are definite fans!    (Please ignore all the people who complained on this site, but didn't take the initiative to bring it to the attention of Church Brew Works so that they could rectify it immediately - the night we were there in September, the manager must have come by our table two or three times just to check on us - he was the one who actually took the initiative to get the musicians to play my guy a birthday song when I told him why we were there [his birthday] ... use your adult voices and say something next time you start to get that \"I'm not happy\" feeling - guaranteed a manager would want to fix the situation immediately. No one wants unhappy customers \"yelping\" dramatic negative reviews without the opportunity to make it right on the spot.)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times on my work travels in Pittsburgh and it is my favorite place to bring coworkers for a beer and meal. Last time I went I was on a diet, and picked the Vegetarian Spaghetti. The \"noodles\" were actually zucchini and the \"marinara\" was made with beets and served with Falafel \"meatballs\". It was very satisfying and I didn't miss the meat at all. Its a great atmosphere and a must do in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Is there anything more wrong their drinking beer at church? Yeah my pure enjoyment of the debauchery, why did my beer taste so much better in a church? Wine never does. And not only was my brew delicious it was priced right, my 2 fantastic pints were between $2.50 and $4.50 and both on point.   So as far as grub... It was way overpriced. We had Pierogies, which from my understanding are unique to the Burgh, they were delicious for four $3.25 for potato and cheese and $7.00 for Sausage and sauerkraut which was amazing. I had the Jambalaya which was pretty good, but not $18.00 good. So while the food and drink was good the price needs help, at least on the food.   Beautiful Church by they way I hope you heathens enjoy drinking your wicked brew in it as much as I did."}
{"text":"The positives of this joint is the beautiful setting and atmosphere, but the place gets so loud you can barely hear. I've been here many times because it's a bit of a cultural phenomenon, but I've never been satisfied.  The beer is decent enough, but in the saturated market of microbrews, pick something else.   The food is okay. I've tried a variety of dishes here, and all fall flat. The perogies (tried many kinds) are okay, still a bit bland. I'm not sure how you mess up a buffalo chicken salad, but they've figured it out. Almost none of the $18+ dishes even come with a salad, you have to purchase them individually for like $5.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"WOW!  Hidden gem of Pittsburgh.  This is an actual church turned brewery. If you like beer and good food, you need to get your rump-de in this place.  The aromas when you walk in are incredible."}
{"text":"My 2 cousins and I visited today and were glad we did!  The food was great and so was the beer!  And the idea of a brewery in an old church with beautiful stained glass windows is brilliant!"}
{"text":"I always want to love it here.  While CBW had *ahem* an excellent brewer for a period of time, I regularly stopped for a beer or lunch while walking to the Strip for summer grocery shopping.  That said, the food is great, the ambiance is great, and the beer is back to mediocre-at-best again.  It still is a fun place to take out-of-towners for dinner, but take them somewhere else for beer."}
{"text":"I travel for work a fair bit. In some cities it's easy to find tasty, unique (non-chain) places to eat; others not so much. So, when my colleague said, \"I heard about a brew pub in an old church,\" my response was, \"Say no more--I am SO there.\"  It did not disappoint.  Was it mind-blowingly delicious food? No, but it was tasty and enjoyable as far as road food goes.  Was it the most amazing beer I've ever had? I don't know--I'm not exactly a beer snob. Was it a great place to kick back some beers with a colleague and a business partner? Definitely.  Sure beat eating in the hotel restaurant, or a mega-chain which is guaranteed to be uninspired and uninspiring fare.  As we left, I noticed they have a veggie patch out back. It's too early in the season for me to benefit from that garden, but I'm sure it makes its way to the table later in the summer, and that earns them an extra star in my book."}
{"text":"It is a must-visit for those new to Pittsburgh. Yes it is a brew house restaurant built into a church. It is breathtaking and you have to go see it for yourself. It is a spiritual experience.  Food is also amazing. Every dish we got -- crab dip, Pierogies appetizer, Pierogie Sauté, Wagyu steak, grilled salmon salad, brewmisu  -- was tasty.  And the beer selection was very impressive! I especially loved the chocolate lager.  This is a landmark restaurant and it rocks in every way!"}
{"text":"So cool! Beer was good and pretty cheap. I'm sure there are some folks who don't approve of this place but I think it's great, we had to see it to believe you can drink in a church. They could spice up the decoration a little, there's a lot of potential for murals and cool decor but  the interior is pretty plain and simple considering the funky concept"}
{"text":"To start off, make sure you know there isn't just one menu. And make sure your waiter/waitress tells you and addresses that. We sat there waiting while the people who got there after us enjoyed almost all of their meals. Came to our attention that there is another menu a pub menu with lots of other options. If that wasn't agitating enough when we got our food an hour after ordering it it was lukewarm at most, and easily identifiable that it had been sitting and re warmed in a microwave due to the burning plates and cold food. The waiter, who seemed to be new but wasn't showed no sympathy or empathy and so we got the manager who took off the cheapest items on our bill. Still paid a little over a hundred dollars for 5 people who got cold meals. So if you're in Pittsburgh looking for an expensive meal don't expect to get the expensive-like service here. You might as well warm up a TV dinner at home and save your money."}
{"text":"This was great! We were a group of 7 women (nightmare table) and the service was great. Loved my cheesesteak and enjoyed a flight of beers. The atmosphere was one of a kind-have to see it if you're visiting."}
{"text":"Pros: The food. The unique beer. The service. The atmosphere.  Cons: Nothing!  As a tourist to Pittsburgh, I simply had to check this place out. As soon as you walk in, the first word out of your mouth is \"Wow!\" They really did a great job restoring this church, and making it into a bar/restaurant.   I went here once for dinner and once for lunch. I tried four different beers. All had their own special flavor. The chicken quesadillas have a very unique taste to them. They're definitely not your typical quesadillas. A bit of a kick to em.  This is the perfect place to go to if you're visiting!"}
{"text":"How much fun is this place?!?  I'll tell you.  It's loads of fun.    First things first: a big thank you to Pitt Yelper Kat M. for suggesting husband and I come here on our trip to the 'Burgh.  You were right, we loved Church Brew Works!  If you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.]  For two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.    Our brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.  Aaaaa-men."}
{"text":"just like a real church, this place was built on false promises. if you're a beer lover, a beer aficionado, just avoid. avoid. the beers are mediocre. intermediate homebrew level at best. cool location, weak beers I didnt want to finish. actually I drank just enough to leave without having to explain why...and I never \"leave a man behind.\" menu describes their dunkel as \"tasting like a lager should.\" pro tip: dunkels aren't lagers."}
{"text":"The novelty of the setting can only carry your experience so far. The food itself was sad and frustrating - especially considering the price of some dishes.  As I looked over the menu, I noticed one consistency: most dishes sounded very ordinary or even boring except for one or two incongruous ingredients. It is as if they are trying to make everything different or special by adding an arbitrary distinction.  My dinner started with the Seven Onion soup. Arbitrary Distinction #1. Are onions really so varied in flavor once cooked in broth and cheese that using seven varieties will create a nuanced dish? Well, it was decent but no different than French Onion soup anywhere else, made with six fewer onions no doubt.  After the dinner menu failed to pique my appetite, I ordered the Turkey and Swiss sandwich from the pub menu. It arrived on pumpernickel slices, plain and untoasted like an elementary school lunch. This brown bagger of a sandwich consisted of dry turkey crumbles paired with greens and red onion but no moisture. The occasional taste of cranberry? Arbitrary distinction #2. I found myself painting it in ranch dressing and sucking down water just to be able to swallow without choking.  One table mate ordered the mussels dish. I noticed him rubbing the white sauce from the meat onto the garlic bread and I soon realized why. After biting into the bread with the sauce, I found myself being force to spit it into a napkin. The white sauce was so salty, bus loads of Jewish tourists could float on the surface of it. The bread was harshly peppered. They were inedible.  Another table mate's dish included a lemon aioli (#3) that was runny and astringent, as if flavored with Pledge Multisurface. Another had the southwesty wrap (I forget the name) and only ate the insides. The reason was a tortilla that was spicy enough to choke a person (#4). Want to dip your fries in my chipotle ketchup (#5)? I'll pass.  I'm glad that the service was attentive because my palate needed those four water refills. Some advice, Brew Works? Pick a dish one at a time and refine it. Make it delicious. Your food doesn't need novelty condiments and bizarre pairings to be unique and memorable. It just needs to be good."}
{"text":"This place is great! Brews and pizza were excellent! The coolest thing about this place though is the location. It's located in an old church with the pews still being used as seats for booth tables! They were brewing beer right on the church stage. This was my first time in Pittsburgh and this was a great place to eat and see in an awesome city."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and enjoyed ourselves both times. Pierogies here are great and a consistent theme. Pierogie pasta? Check. Traditional pierogies? Check. Daily specialty pierogies? Check. Pierogie pizza? Check. The last time I was here we had the traditional pierogies, they were fried perfectly and served with onions and sour creme. We also enjoyed the dry rubbed pork pierogies with a sriracha sour cream. The flavor was amazing, but they weren't cooked as good as the traditional. Lastly we had the spinach feta and smoked gouda dip. I really enjoyed it, but there wasn't enough dip vs. the amount of chips provided. I really didn't get a feta taste, the gouda and spinach worked well together. Obviously this place is beautiful on the inside and it's a unique place to enjoy dinner. The alter area consists of the brew tanks, the confessional is a liquor cabinet, the chairs are repurposed pews, the list of creativity goes on and on. If you aren't an alcohol drinker, the house brewed birch beer is worth a try. The service can be hit or miss, not amazing, but not terrible. My biggest complaint is pricing. I would say the food prices run a little high given the portion and quality. Not by much, about a $1 on appetizers and $3 on entrées. I will return again when I am in town and look forward to trying new items.  *The pizza oven has burned, but should be back up and running 9 months."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5 stars Beer: 4 stars Food: 3 stars  Service: 4 stars  DH loved the beer, he tried almost all of them (!). I had a glass of wine (very overpriced, $7 for a glass of flying nun - the whole bottle costs at $8 at the state store! Pittsburgh steak chicken salad was tasty but made with mostly iceberg lettuce. DH had a cheesesteak sandwich was he said was good.  All in all, I would recommend this place to try at least once!"}
{"text":"Holy wait times! It must be amazing! Alas, no. Great concept, for sure. I love the idea. Beer was brewed by monks in monasteries, right? It's also got great architecture and all that. But the place smells terrible, it's really (really) loud. And there is no air conditioning. We were there on a hot night in June and it was very warm and stuffy, and humid as well. The ladies room was not very tidy, which is a pet peeve of mine. Anyway, our server was nice (Shane) and he was knowledgeable and helpful enough. They were out of my husband's favorite Church Brew Thunder Hop IPA which was a disappointment, but he enjoyed the recommended substitution. The appetizer we ordered was the lettuce wraps and it was fine. It had chicken chunks that were a little dry, so I didn't really enjoy it all that much.  My husband had the shrimp and grits, which he devoured, so I believe it was good. He said it was very spicy and tasty. I had the salmon with roast  pepper mashed potatoes and it was good as well. While the food was fine, it just wasn't great. I was expecting something really different or super tasty and this was not it. It was just average. This was the second time we tried to come to this restaurant and given the wait times (75-90 minutes!?) and the letdown of the shabby interior, bad smell, dirty facility and LOUD place, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"The city of Pittsburgh is horrible. I can't stand it. But if anyone were to ever visit the city, I would beg them to go to Church Brew Works. Get the fried pickles! They're awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my kind of place - an old church with a lot of gothic architectural detail, converted into a bar and restaurant with their brewery equipment upon the altar.  I can dig it.  My room mates and I went here for a celebratory meal, this being my first week in Pittsburgh.  Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.  We ordered the brew sampler (the dunkel and the stout are definitely my speed), which included some seasonal beers.  I'm looking forward to what they might brew this winter.  Additionally we ordered the Spinach, Gouda & Feta dip as an appetizer and it was nothing short of spectacular, I highly recommend it (comes with pita triangles).  We shared a Chicken & Andouille pizza which tasted good with its high quality ingredients, including fresh tomatoes.  Whenever you feel like chillin' in a church, sippin' a brew (which for some people might be every Sunday), this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have previously loved this place, but after my most recent experience, I may go elsewhere.   Maybe it was just a bad night, but the waitress took forever to take our order, there were only four of their beers currently available, there were bugs everywhere, and our waitress didn't may me and my friend barely any attention since she was also waiting a table of a large group (more food=more tip). I don't ask for royal treatment, but isn't it common courtesy to stop by once and ask how everything is once you've gotten your food? The food is okay, but overpriced for what it is. I'm not a picky eater at all, but I don't want to pay that much for something I could get for way cheaper at a regular bar.  That being said...it's pretty."}
{"text":"Restaurant/brewery in an old church you say? I'm intrigued.  Church Brew Works gives you some really good food in a cool atmosphere. I'm not a drinker so I can't report on the brews. Had a pasta dish with shrimp. It was very good. I think all of us really liked our dishes except for maybe the couscous salad. Didn't try the pizza but some of those looked really good.  We had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a seat but in part because we didn't mind waiting and didn't feel like hovering in the half of the restaurant with open seating. They take reservations for groups of 8 or larger. Prices are a little on the higher end, but so is the food. Main dishes are in the 15-25 range but they are filling and taste great. Good, knowledgeable servers.  My only real complaint, the very poorly marked front entrance. FYI, it is the center door at the front of the church, which seems logical but when you are there, it is not easy to tell."}
{"text":"It's a church... yes. It's a Catholic Cathedral... yes. It's a gutted Roman Catholic historical landmark made into a brewery/restaurant ... yes.  The crucifix was hauled off and brewers were put in place. Soooo sinister. Food was 3.5 but i really just wanted to come here because it was so awkward. I'd prob come back just because it is unique."}
{"text":"Given my penchant for sacrilege, this was right up my alley. Steel tank on the altar...yeah. We sat out on the patio cos it was a great day, and had their cask conditioned ale. Their food was pretty good. The french onion soup was fine and the buffalo meatloaf was very good, particularly the grilled vegetables. We also had the homemade potato chips which I really liked. A fun and funky place."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a late lunch. We loved the atmosphere. We split the Cuban nachos which were great but could have used more sour cream. I ordered the pierogis, I highly recommend them. I asked for samples of beer and the waiter was very accommodating. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Water into Beer  On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the beer was gone, Jesus' mother said to Him, \"They have no more beer.\" \"Dear woman, why do you involve me,\" Jesus replied, \"My time has not yet come.\" His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever He tells you.\"  Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind the Jews use for ceremonial washing, each holding from 20 to 30 gallons. Jesus said to the servants, \"Fill the jars with water,\" so they filled them to the brim. Then He said to them, \"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.\"  They did so and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into Beer. He did not realize where it had come from although the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside and said, \"Everyone brings out the India Pale Ale first and then the Pale Blue Ribbon after the guests have had too much to drink, but you have saved the best till now.\"  This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed His Glory and the disciples put their faith in Him. (John 2:1-11)"}
{"text":"What!? Eating in the lord's house? This place looks pretty cool. The food was okay and not that special, everything was good just think I can get the same food, same quality and a lower price elsewhere. I don't drink but I was told by the people at my table that they have some really good booze.  The waitress was very very very attentive and answered all our questions on food and different brews."}
{"text":"I wish I love d the Church Brew Works, but I don't. I like it, but don't love it.  Atmosphere gets an A. It is pretty cool the way the brewery and restaurant sit in a church. Out of towners I'm sure love this aspect of the restaurant.  Food:  good. Not great. Hummus is decent. Bruschetta decent. Had the mussels most recently. Good. I've had better. Frites...eh. Run of the mill.  Beer: I want to love the beer. I really do...but I'm always underwhelmed. I even bought two bottles at a charity auction years back and one I spilled out. I'm a craft beer lover. I like them all...stouts to wheats to sours to saisons. I'm just never totally impressed when I order a beer here. I will say it's better on tap than in a bottle.   I also think it's overpriced for quality and portion.   All in all will I return to Church? Yes, but I will most like be part of the Easter/Christmas congregation."}
{"text":"I was just reminded to rate Church Brew Works after reading another yelp review that mentioned the smell of the place. It is very obviously caused by the beer they brew there, but it reminds me of being in a barn. Not a barn with dirty animals, but an old barn with lots of old hay all over the ground. It's not CBW's fault that I can't handle that smell because that is a side effect of brewing beer within a restaurant, but I can't do it.    The only other con for CBW is that I don't like some of their beer. Let me be clear, *some* of their beer is not for me, but I've had a few that I like, and if you're unsure you can always order samples. Every time I've been to CBW the staff has been great and they are more than willing to bring samples (and take pictures of you and your best friend who is visiting from out of town.)  All of the food I've eaten at CBW was good, but the desserts were really GREAT. The most memorable dessert experience involved splinting multiple desserts (something seasonal and another off the regular menu), and BEER ICE CREAM. Beer. Ice Cream. Do I need to say more? It was better than expected.   One last note- I hate saying things that are even slightly negative if the restaurant has done nothing wrong, and Church Brew Works really has a lot of things going very well for them, but me being \"sensitive\" (or something) can't handle inhaling barn-like fumes while eating.    Everyone else I've visited CBW with has been 100% okay with the smell (and everything else they have to offer.)"}
{"text":"I really loved the place.  When the hotel shuttle pulled up, bf didn't notice the sign on the corner and said \"Are you sure this is really a restaurant?\"  It was busy inside, but we were able to get a seat at the long, winding bar. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the bf makes up for that.  His favorite pour was the Xtreme Thunder Hops.  I took a taste and it was so hoppy, it felt like an assault on my tongue, but he likes that kind of thing. I had a glass of wine and the Cajun Risotto Fritters appetizer. Wow, they were great.  Altho I will say that considering they're just little fried rice balls...$8 for 5 or 6 of them is a little steep.  Due to the church interior, it can get very loud inside, with voices bouncing off all the walls.  I just loved the interior of the building. Just a gorgeous place. Our bartender was a sweetie and we met some nice people to talk to at the bar.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Personally, Church Brew is one of those places I never venture myself, but I always take visiting company to...  I mean, it's a brewery...  in a church, and a beautiful one at that.  Relative to beer, Church took a major hit when its head brewery ran down the street to open his own gig (on my list of beers to try!).  Thus far, it seems like the quality of their brews hasn't been majorly affected, but CBW is one of those places that I either absolutely love or absolutely hate their beer.  A monthly rotating \"blast furnace stout\" (different flavors/methods of brewing) always presents an interesting drink, and their Cherry Quadzilla is good if you like fruity interpretations of Belgians.  Thunderhop IPA is that staple of the bunch, and a good representation of the type at that.  Relative to food, Church is generally also hit or miss here too.  Most of their food is average, however their pizza (particularly the wild boar) is extremely good (just be prepared to wait an hour plus if the oven gets backed up).  Overall, I'll give Church the nod as it truly is a unique gem to the city (one that's gotten a lot of national attention, including Brewpub of the Year), but it falls short of a five considering its roughness around the edges and a lack of consistency."}
{"text":"There's nothing like having a brewski at church...  After going to Phipps Conservatory, we headed to Church Brew Works because I like the idea of drinking at church. This place was converted from a church to a brewhouse. I'm not sure what denomination it used to be. Inside, they put the vats of beer at the alter and the pews have been replaced by tables and a bar on the side.  We ordered a pitcher of Celestial Gold, a light malty beer and an artichoke, spinach and feta pizza to share. I thought the pizza was all right and the crust was very thin. All I know that they used a very large communion wafer.   This place is a cool to check out if you are in Pittsburgh. I wouldn't mind back here again for the beer, but  will probably stay away from the pizza and try something on else on the menu."}
{"text":"So cool - the church setting is definitely one of a kind. They have a bunch of unique beers on tap so I would highly recommend ordering a flight to try a variety of 8 selections.   Service is hit or miss and I could see how this place would become overly hectic when busy. We came on Christmas Eve when there was next to no one dining. The portion sizes are humongous - the chicken jambalaya was a bit on the salty side but had a great kick to it.  Worth a visit just to check the place out and grab a drink."}
{"text":"My experience was pretty tricky to review.  We entered and were really impressed with the atmosphere and then sat down at the bar and ordered some beers.  They all came out warm!  The bartender even said something about them being warm and they were unsure as to why that was.  She said all but one beer on tap was warm, and then offered a couple bottled beers that we could have.  After about twenty minutes they were all magically cold again so we tried some.  Between my group of 4 we tried pretty much all the beers and weren't really impressed with any of them.  The atmosphere of Church Brew Works is excellent, but the beers are not that great.  The food all sounded good, but we didn't try any.  If I'm in the area again I may come back to see if they have any different seasonal brews, and maybe try the food, but based on what I've seen so far I don't have particularly high expectations."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING.  I really enjoyed it.  I went to Church Brew Works with a party of 17 during lunch.  It was relatively empty on a Monday afternoon - I was surprised by that.  Being inside of a Catholic church that isn't a church anymore is kind of trippy.  It's definitely an interesting experience.  As I already mentioned, I loved the food.  Every single member of my party had nothing but fantastic things to say about the food...the service, however, will keep me from ever returning.  Which is a pretty major thing to say, but our waitress was really frustrated she was assigned our table and had no qualms about showing it.  We made reservations in advance so Church Brew Works knew we were coming, we didn't pop up out of nowhere.  Still, it seemed we were ruining a perfectly fine slow Monday for our waitress.  The poor new girl, who was left to deliver our food by herself, was so new to the restaurant that she couldn't identify which dish was which.  At the end, after growing frustrated with any requests we had (which was for a lemon in a glass of water) to not bringing out any water for those who requested it, our waitress threw a tantrum when the leader of our party signed the check but accidentally took the wrong copy with him.  She nastily replied that she couldn't believe he wouldn't leave a tip and harassed a few of those left behind.  At least three members of our party complained to the manager.  It was a series of unfortunate events, but what Church Brew Works accomplished was turning away 17 potential repeat customers.  A few others in my party mentioned they'd had similar experiences where the food was phenomenal but the service was horrendous.   Is Church Brew Works worth a try?  Sure, you won't be disappointed in the food but don't expect polite or even indifferent service."}
{"text":"Excellent beers and very cool decor. Having a great time. I have never been in a Catholic Church and not fallen asleep"}
{"text":"Cool location in an old church. I was underwhelmed by their beer, but know many people that enjoy it. Maybe being from the Midwest with some of the best breweries in the country cloud my expectations. Great for larger groups as it's a big space."}
{"text":"Menu has a good variety, appealing to many individuals.  Always curious what the Non Traditional Perogies are each time we are there.  Fun atmosphere; however, the meal/food service can be slow @ times."}
{"text":"What a delight to stop by on my trip to Pittsburgh! My friend and I stopped by to try the beer and maybe an appetizer endemic to the area. 3 hours later and 6 beers in we tried the traditional pierogies. It was delicious and even though it was cooked it tasted very fresh. However what I really want to review is the beer. As recommended by our bartender we tried the goh-suh, and it was exquisite! Tasted like a combination of mimosa and margaritas, which to me is a delightful experience. I highly recommend The Church Brew Works!"}
{"text":"Ok, let's just state the obvious... the place is awesome. One of the best experiences of any brewery or restaurant i've ever been too. I mean, who DOESN'T want to drink beer in a beautiful and historic church?  Now that that's over with, I wasn't impressed by the beer, or the food, but overall it's worth trying just for the experience."}
{"text":"Love the church brew works.....food is differnt and unique...went there with a group of freinds a few weeks ago - fantastic.....trufully not a beer drinker  - but my husband said the beer is amazing ...love this place"}
{"text":"I have been to Church Brew Works several times over the years, and must have never yelped about it. I have even lived within a few blocks of it for the past 3 years.  I will say this, it is not the Church Brew that I remember.  The beers are OK- from their usual rotation to whatever sort of seasonal they are churning out. I had the Millenium Trippel, and my girlfriend had the coconut stout. Both were reasonable.  Our appetites were slavering, having just circumnavigated the downtown looking for somewhere to park for the Jazz festival, yet leaving maligned due to the usual parking issues of downtown Pgh during an event. On the way back, we figured we had not been to Church Brew in a long time, so it would be just the ticket.   They had an insert with southern/ creoleish dishes as the specials. This really got my tastebuds raring to go, as I love spicy southern food. To start, we had the alligator peirogies, and for entrees, the Cubano, and the Pulled Pork.  The peirogies were tasty enough, but I really did not get anything related to an alligator out of that. Hide I been blind, or blindfolded, I would have assumed they were regular peirogies with a bit of chutney on top.   My girlfriends Cubano was a huge disappointment. This is the second time we have tried to get a Cuban Sammich somewhere and left thinking \"WTF\".  This sandwich is about 1) Well toasted bread 2) A good slathering of mustard 3) an evenly spread layer of crunchy pickle and 4) meat.  In that order.   My pulled pork was flavorful, but no world beater by any stretch, and was paired with rice and beans minus anything to complement them in terms of flavors. Dont get me wrong, I think those ingredients go together, but some extra spices or textures would have made the dish superb."}
{"text":"When this first place opened it was fantastic.  Over the years it slowly lost it's luster.  It is a large and cavernous space, which is great for large parties.  However, it always looks empty, even if there is a decent crowd in there.   Service has always been mediocre and they could do a little revamping of their menu to compete with all of the other craft brewery places."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time here. I had the Buffalo burger and she had a lime chicken sandwich. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted great. I also had a flight of beer which I enjoyed greatly. Caitlin R. our server also went above and beyond. She was very helpful and offered suggestions to other local places that we should check out. The best of all this place also had a parking lot...which seems a rare find in Pittsburgh. We would gladly return here if we take a trip to Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Inconsistant. I've been a few times and have had some great meals and some really poor meals served cold. The pierogies are pretty good though a bit expensive for what you get, the sandwiches are good and good portions, the entrees are all a bit higher priced for what you get.  One thing that's been great every time I have gone has been the beers, decent selection of great craft beers."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance to my house, and Im glad to finally have a neighborhood church Im down with. This is a great one of a kind concept and is a brew pub set up in an old church. The service was prompt and we were seated right away. Im an IPA lover, and theirs is one of the smoothest IPA's I've ever had. We started off the meal with the regular pierogies appetizer. They were delicious. Kind of reminded me of a good quality tortilla the way the dough was crispy on the tops and topped with onions and sour cream. For my main course I had the buffalo meatloaf, and it was hands down the best meatloaf I've ever had. The meat was robust and flavorful and I don't know how they did it, but it seemed to have a grilled crust on the outside of each piece. It was amazing. The mashed potatoes were a bit strange in their texture, almost like grits, but still very good. The gravy was excellent as well. I highly recommend church brew works and will definitely be back here again especially since its right up the street!"}
{"text":"We traveled to the Church Brew Works in the pouring rain, & it did not disappoint. The energy of this place alone is worth experiencing, especially on a slow day. I decided to sip on their own Sunday Morning IPA, which lifted my sunken spirit. It was a 5.6% ABV. Excellent ratio of Hops to Malt. Perfect for a rainy Sunday. We also ordered the Lamb Meatball Trio Appetizer. The portion size is on the smaller side (3 balls), but the delicacy makes up for it. Nothing short of spectacular. The locally sourced Lamb was cooked to perfection. The Ricotta & garnished Sprouts paired delicately with the Vodka reduction sauce itself. The Meatballs literally melt in your mouth.. savory to say the least. I couldn't have asked for a better salvation on such a dreary afternoon."}
{"text":"This is  a pretty sweet place.  When you walk in you kind of have this wtf moment and don't know what to think.  It's a church, but they're brewin' brews at the altar.  Kind of messed up, sort of.  Though, let's not lie, you know it's pretty cool.  The food that I had was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We had the feta cheese/spinach pizza which had a generous amount of vegetables and crust that was just a tad bit undercooked for my liking, but still decently tasty.  The appetizer (perogies) and desert (blueberry ice cream and chocolate mousse) were all excellent.    I'm giving this place three stars, because while I think it's solid, I don't think it's all that it's cracked up to be.  The beer selection doesn't look all that extensive, though I suppose you'd like it if you're big into craft brews.  The food is somewhat pricey and from what I had, I could think of a few other places where I'd rather eat for the price I'm paying.    Then again, I'm weird and this is just me.  This place is a Pittsburgh tradition, I suppose.  Try it out at least for the ambiance.  It certainly is interesting..."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere!   Wide variety of hand crafted beers.  The French onion soup was spectacular!!  We also had the spinach, feta and Gouda cheese dip.  It was good but not enough dip for the amount of chips given.  All in all, a very good lunch :)"}
{"text":"This is such a cool idea - make an old church a brewery! They actually left the stain glass, bench seating at entry way, and the alter in the front which displays their equipment for brewing their beers. I want to start off mentioning the service here which is impeccable. They are very attentive, good sense of humors, and the manager came over to our table and asked how every thing was going. Now the food is really good, but I didn't care for the beers so much. I like wheat and fruity beer so I just don't think this was the right brewery for me. We ordered the buffalo pierogies to share and they were probably the best pierogies I ever had! Also, since it was my birthday, they gave us a big piece of chocolate mousse cake with peanut brittle for free! Even if you aren't hungry or thirsty, this place is worth a visit for the ambience alone!"}
{"text":"If you have time to spend here and are looking for a casual place to eat, feel free to stop by and pay a little extra for the experience. Nothing went wrong during our visit but I don't believe we will ever eat here again. The place is awesome to look at and view but you pay a pretty penny to be able to look around with some small portions. The beer was great and I would consider coming for just a drink but our food was nothing to rave about. I purchased a salad that I ate 1/2 of and my boyfriend got a dish that was too small, we ended up getting food again later! Again, not the worst place but it's a pretty steep price for the experience."}
{"text":"I am a Catholic and had no problem walking into this place!  Um, that is until I walked down the aisle and began to get that eerie feeling...like I was at a wake or something.  To be honest, it felt weird but I enjoyed myself.  The inside of the church was awesome...especially the tank setup at the altar and to the left of the aisle.  I went to Church Brew Werks over the winter and do not remember what I ordered for dinner, but I do remember what I ordered to drink - STOUT!  I had two of them and my co-worker had the sampler along with some pale ale, I believe.  I remember the beer being outstanding.  So much so, I took a growler back to the hotel and put it into my luggage to bring back home with me..."}
{"text":"Shitty.  I stopped by at midnight on a Saturday and was surprised to find an almost empty church.  Although technically open till 1am, our server made it pretty clear that they did not want to deal with customers anymore.  We ordered a beer each, all of which were pretty good but not exceptional.  Overall we felt very unwelcome, and were appalled at the rude service.  Maybe it was just a bad night, but I was far from impressed."}
{"text":"Drinking beer in a church? This I had to experience. Several of my friends were also former alter boys and felt a bit of guilt, just for a minute ;)  From the outside it still maintains the facade of the former church, nothing changed except for a sign of restaurant's name, and even that has been made to fit with the church. When you do enter inside it really has an amazing ambiance. The stained glass has been kept and some of the pews as well. The large brewing casks against the wall and in the back fit well with the cavernous interior.  They had some great choices of their own beer and priced very reasonably considering the microbrew quality. I chose the stout which had chocolate tones with a bit of coconut, and no kidding the first sip I had made me think I was drinking a Mound's candy bar!  They had a choice of choosing from their dining menu or their bar menu. I chose the BBQ chicken slaw melt. It was a a good size chicken breast that was juicy topped with cole slaw, and melted provolone cheese, and bacon :) Yum!  It seemed everyone else enjoyed their meals as well, although the buffalo burger seemed a tad small.  Our server was great. He even brought individual checks for our group of 10.  Although it's not in the most convenient location it is well worth the trip to go out of your way to get here."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Didn't have the beer since we had to drive for 2 hours.  The waiter was impossible to understand. A mumbling whisperer who didn't have any info on the food or beers.    Had a Rueben, ice tea followed by banana bread pudding. The food was okay not phenomenal.  I might try it again but not on. Sunday at noon"}
{"text":"Amazing building. Decent food. The server was helpful and attentive without hovering. Oats Mcoats brew was outstanding. Great first stop in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had pirogis as an appetizer and they were greasy and unappetizing.   I had noticed that salads at other restaurants I had tried looked wilted and disgusting and so I had been avoiding ordering them even though I'd been dying for some veggies. So I asked the waitress about the quinoa salad at Church Brew. The waitress assured me that their salads were fresh and top quality. She seemed very offended that I would even ask about the quality of the salads.   What she brought me though was a wilted mess slathered in dressing. Some of the leaves were downright bad and had gone brown and squishy.   The quinoa was unbelievable. It tasted like old refrigerator."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But...the food got average. I don't drink beer. And it is SO loud that I can't enjoy myself. I'll go if others really want to, but it is not on my top 10 list at all. It was also odd. If you sit on one side you get one menu; the other side another and you couldn't order off of the \"other\" side's menu. That seemed very weird to me.  When they first opened their pizza drew you in. Now, it seems secondary. And...and this is a big one...if you do order a pizza and they are particularly busy, you could wait a long time for your pizza. It seems if you are known for your pizza, you would perfect the timing of it better. Again, good food. Interesting atmosphere. But, just too loud for me (maybe I'm just old!!)."}
{"text":"Again, I apologize for coming across with only negative reviews, but I'll only do this if my family's experience has gone from good to bad.  It's a matter of principle.  We used to LOVE the pizza at his place.  Driving downtown to the Church Brew Works, just to have the Southwestern pizza, we were met with a stale smell as we were seated far in the back, away from all the others (because we're a gay married couple or because we have multi-racial children?).  When we asked about the pizza, they told us that they no longer served it because their ovens had caught on fire.  So we got up and left.  For pete's sake, FIX your ovens or make them fire-safe to begin with.  Sigh.  Not returning."}
{"text":"Service can be slow. That's the worst thing I can come up with. Most of their dishes are VERY good, the remaining are alright. We've never been offended by anything we've ordered. The beers are also very good, and the birch beer is GREAT! A unique and beautiful setting to be certain, but the food and drink hold their own."}
{"text":"Nice place, go there for the beer. The food is ok but nothing to write home about. Portions are small for the price. Kitchen is kind of slow."}
{"text":"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned...I think.   Well, I'm not sure where sampling beers on a Sunday afternoon at a micro-brew located in a former Catholic church necessarily fits in the whole scheme of things, but I felt I was violating some type of rule, code or commandment. Regardless, Church Brew Works had been at the top of my Pittsburgh to-do list since I heard about it last summer and I was checking it out, regardless.  Since I've never tried their beer before, I decided to order the sampler, consisting of eight different 5oz brews for $12.75. But after doing some quick math, I realized I needed to address my growling stomach first to avoid any unintentional purge-atory (rim shot). After looking through the variety of menu options, I decided on the lunch version of the Garden Plum Tomato brick-oven pizza. Aside from being crispy and tasty, it turned out to be the perfect size for one person.  Anyway, back to the beer. Sorry. There were four year-round samples consisting of Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkle (+), Blast Furnace Stout (+) and Pipe Organ Pale Ale. There were also four seasonal brews consisting of Red Nebyllek, Coffee Dunkel (+), Thunder Hop and Oktoberfest (+). It was a great mix of all different types: light, dark and everything in between.  Regarding the interior, I love how they've kept the original structure, including the pews, fixtures and woodwork, mostly the same. Plus, you can walk up center aisle, which divides two separate dining areas, to the front of the church where large, copper brew tanks sit on the front altar. It's sort of weird, yet cool, to see.  Spending lunch here was a fun and pleasant experience and I was glad to see so many other people \"congregating\" here as well. Okay, okay, I'm done.  (+) = liked"}
{"text":"Beer selection is great and one of the most generous beer flights around. Apps are great when you're looking for late night bites too."}
{"text":"They brew the beer on the altar -- enough said!   Seriously though, this is a cool restaurant with tons of indoor seating in addition to a nice outdoor courtyard. The food I've had here has been good and they have a nice selection of beer. Definitely worth trying if you've never had dinner in an old church! Try the pizzas -- they're excellent."}
{"text":"This place is extremely cool.  Yes, it's in a big old church.  Yes, the beer is great.  I've had limited food here, but what I had was very decent.  I need to re-visit, and when I do, I'll write more.  Give it a try and tell us what YOU think."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing.   Big old Catholic church repurposed as a brew pub with vats where the alter was.  It ended up looking like an old german beer house with long benches for communal-esque enjoyment.  I Went with the pub menu, though they have quite an extensive regular, i guess, menu.  Buffalo burger was perfectly cooked, med rare, and tasty as can be.  Grabbed an excellent dark beer I don't recall the name of and I was happy as can be.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to venture back here and try some other fare next time I'm in Pitt."}
{"text":"I truly believe this place is overrated. Although we were seated outside, the inside had an odd stench to it-- almost chlorine-like. It was off-putting and had we not been seated outside, I would have requested that this happen because I could barely breathe. Has anyone else experienced this?  The food was decent. I got soup, and we also had wings and my husband got a burger. I believe we also got spinach artichoke dip too, which was pretty tasty. I had a bloody Mary, which was also good, but I'm just not sure what all the hype was about. Sure, the inside is neat, but it's mostly just an old building with a high ceiling. Sitting outside, it was decorated with the flags of different countries, which was a different touch.   Our waitress was good and explained the different kinds of peirogies they had. The ones I wanted (the peirogies of the day) were sold out. Dissapointing. I might give CBW another chance in the future, but it would take some convincing. Personally, I'd rather eat in a shack with outstanding food than in an old church with sub-par food, but that's just me. ;)"}
{"text":"Church Brew Works doesn't just brew some darn fine beer, they also offer a beautiful establishment to enjoy your crafted beverage.  It's a lovely, open, repurposed church that is always busy.  The waits can be long, perhaps unbearable especially on the weekends.  This last stop we lucked out and scored a couple of seats at the bar.  At first we were sitting in the corner which isn't very comfortable or warm, but soon were able to move dead center and really have a great view of the institution and the people.   I prefer IPA's and their ThunderHop IPA definitely gets my stamp of approval on what a good IPA must contain.  Nice hop, great bitterness but without being too fruity.  I also like their Oktoberfest which they still had on tap.  The Christmas beers can be tricky sometimes they are just too spiced with cloves and whatnot but theirs isn't bad.  Definitely a good stop for a tasty beer.  I haven't tried their food yet but the venue is perfect for a small gathering of friends to sit eat and drink.  I would recommend reservations especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"The Church itself was interesting. And my hubby loved his beer. But the food was mediocre and overpriced -  we were there for Dinner on a Sat night. Had to ask for bread bc we waited so long for the food and we saw other tables had bread. It was very loud. The stained glass and pews were interesting, but the other random pictures on the walls didn't make sense. Fun to go once."}
{"text":"I went back to the CBW this weekend (after a rather long absence) for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. I'd heard they'd gotten progressively less nice in comparison to the other wonderful dining options now available in the area, however Kyle loves their beer and I was curious to go and see if they'd stepped up there game at all. I can now say I think the Lawrenceville competition has been rather good for them. Things that bothered me on my last visit when compared to the numerous great experiences I'd had previously weren't issues any longer.   The service was great from start to finish, unlike the rather awkward experience I had there before taking a break. I'd always loved coming to the CBW with out of town friends or on special occasions for slightly less greasy pub food, and in that aspect I think some of their menu changes are working well! The new chicken options are delicious, and the pulled pork looks way better than what I ordered last time. I went with the Maui chicken sandwich on this visit, and the massive slice of grilled pineapple was a nice touch. There are also some vegan dishes that seem promising.   For drinks we got the beer sampler on this trip, and it was such a great deal. Only the Christmas ale was lacking in character. The other seven beers were wonderful. I don't think I'll get anything other than the sampler in future honestly. I do hope the CBW continues in this promising way. It's such a fun place for visitors or on nights when I'm craving certain beers, and I'd hate to see it go downhill."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works - proof that God is a beer drinker.  The food is good, but for me it's usually just something to munch on while I drink.  In other words, I don't really go there for the food.  I've never had a disappointing food item.  The pizza is out of this world and the appetizers and daily specials always have something interesting that catches my eye.    While the food is good, the beer is better.  I find myself a fan of their seasonal offerings more than the signature brews which makes me sad because I keep having to find a new favorite.  Ask for samples if you're not sure.  But if you find something you really like that's a seasonal, get a growler before you leave.  My overall experience here is that the bartenders are better than the waiters.  In other words if there's only two of you, sit at the bar.  You'll likely get better service."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. The beer was okay tended to be on the bitter side of things. Bread pudding while buzzed is pretty top notch though. They use their pious monk beer in the cinnamon creme drizzle over the ice cream and pudding."}
{"text":"Sweet place, but a little sacreligious with the distilleries on the church's diases...  Ergo, it's an awesome time!  The micro-brews are cool, and I'd recommend getting the seasonal ale!  The food is on par with high end chain restaurants, their appetizers are out of this world though!  It's wallet friendly, but not so nice to the arteries!"}
{"text":"The fries are the perfect combination of crisp and salty and, of course, they are served with Heinz ketchup. I enjoyed sipping on the Pious Monk Dunkel, but wish I had tried the Pumpkin Stout. The Chicken Sausage Sandwich had a bit of a spicy kick to it, but the kick was tampered by the aiolis that coated the soft sweet bun."}
{"text":"During a weekend trip to Pittsburgh with several beer aficionados, we had to try Church Brew Works! It certainly is a sight to see. The beautiful stained glass windows, high ceilings, seating from the original pews, and brewing equipment featured on the altar all made for a very unique brewery experience. The beer, however, was only OK. None of the beers on the sampling list wowed any of us. My husband did like the Tripel, which was purchased in a snifter-type glass.  We had a few appetizers to compliment our beer. The buffalo cauliflower was seriously delicious - I will be trying to replicate that on my own very soon. The untraditional pierogies made with rattlesnake and cactus and corn salsa were good but nothing special. The rattlesnake was ground and tasted like any ground meat.  The two downsides of the atmosphere were that the tall tables near the bar were very close together and the women's bathroom had a very bad smell, probably resulting from the carpet in the sink area.  As one person in my group said, people come to this restaurant for the experience rather than the beer or food."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant quite frequently, if my husband and I get a chance to go out on a date we usually pick this place. In fact it's the restaurant he took me to on our first date.  The food has gotten just OK since I first came here almost 10 years ago.  The menu items don't seem to change much like they used to and the pizza was one of the best menu items and there is still no pizza oven so you can't even get that anymore. I brought my daughter here for our girl night for her birthday just this past weekend and I'd have to say it was the worst experience I've had here. The food this time was terrible, the server basically forgot about us and I had to say excuse me to her about 5 times before she came over to give us boxes and the check so we wouldn't miss our show at 8pm. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be making this my go to restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars. We had the spinach dip and cheesesteak, nothing at all special and it was well overpriced for the quality. Decor/space: 4 stars. The ambiance is great, we loved the original stained glass. Cleanliness: 2 stars. It looked clean, but the smell was unbearable. Not sure if it was old building, moldy smell or from the brewery, but yuck. The food may have been 5 stars, but the smell was just too much."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome, as it's not every day you get to dine in a church...and that's what makes this place so unique. The atmosphere is just cool and so different from any other place, if you're a first-timer it's hard to pay attention to others at your table.   The food actually isn't too shabby, either as the menu is very accommodating for varying palettes and even the gluten free. Plus, they have a more than adequate beer selection along with some good, mixed spirits as well.   All in all, come for the atmosphere, bring some friends with you, and take in some good eats...with a few \"beverages\" to wash it all down in the house of the good Lord above!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food is ok.  Beer selection never really seems to fit my taste though."}
{"text":"I am not a huge beer drinker, I came here for the food. It wasn't anything out of this world, but what is to expect out of a brewery. From what I hear from beer drinkers is that their product is great.  Cool set up in the place."}
{"text":"This is weird to say but the desserts were amazing, the best part of the meal. The dinner food was good, nothing over the top, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. The dessert is worth a special trip!"}
{"text":"It's beautiful to walk into this brewery.  Total hipster concept, but lots of fun.  The beer, pizza, and dessert were phenomenal.  I am remiss that I did not purchase a case of the dunkel and bring it back to Baltimore.  I am deducting a star because the wait staff was not particularly friendly.  The hostess was nice, but the others seemed either rushed or inattentive."}
{"text":"This unique venue is situated in a repurposed church turned brewery/restaurant. They feature all their own beer with a diverse selection of beer styles. Utilizing the open floor plan of the church, its almost a communal feel to the dining experience.  A brick oven sits atop of the altar on the right, while there is seating for about 20 on the center \"altar\".   As far as their beer is concerned\"You're Killin Me S'mores\" is excellent and their double IPA is smooth and refreshing. In true brewery style they offer flights so you can sample a variety of their brews.  The brick oven pizzas seem to be their specialty.  However we opted for some of the more upscale entrées. My wife had the Wagu beef with was very tender and flavorful for around $34. I chose the T-bone with sweet mashed potatoes.  I was not as impressed with this cut of meat as it was a thin slice steak and seemed to have been frozen. Bummer, but the sweet mashed were phenomenal.    It seemed as though most dinner parties were ordering the pizza and had i know about the T-bone I would have opted for a different selection.   Overall this unique brewery and restaurant was good and they participate in NoWait which is great as we had a 45-50 min wait."}
{"text":"I think the environment is so creative and fun. The entire restaurant is made of wooden throne-like chairs and pews, and the altar has been turned into a mechanical brewery!  I've only been there a few times to take my visiting friends there and it's a fun experience for them. I'm not sure about my friends, but honestly, I can't say that I've ever had an amazing meal there. It's not terrible by any means, but I never leave thinking, \"I have to come back, like tomorrow.\" However, the beer selection is it's highest point for sure. I have always been extremely satisfied with the different brews I try every time.  The service is good, and the employees have always been knowledgeable of their menu and beer selection, and have always been very speedy with their service. There is a somewhat limited parking lot behind the building. I've never had trouble getting a spot but on it's busiest nights it might be a hassle?  Overall, you must go at least once! But I probably won't be convincing myself to go anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town guests.  My best tip for you is to ask for the bar menu, the food is better, and less expensive.  The Pizza is delicious and creative.  The decor is impressive, although I find the lighting a little too dark.  This place has excellent food and wonderful beer.  Great for groups.  There's additional parking in the back, but I often park on the street."}
{"text":"This place is COOL.  The only micro-brewery located INSIDE a church in the country, according to their brochure.  We'd likely change religions if we lived in Pittsburgh.  $15 to sample 8 different beers, and they are generous 5-oz pours.  We went home with 2 growlers.  There's something for almost every taste."}
{"text":"Pretty good range of pretty good beers with not bad food in an attractive building.  I love the symbolism of expropriating religious imagery for more productive purposes.  But the place has been around awhile at this point, and the concept and the staff seemed to have waning energy.  Closing early on a summer Saturday night seemed a bit lame as well."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I was at Church Brew Works and my visiting Aunt and Uncle suggested it, since it is very close to where I live.  We arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the place was more than half full.  My Uncle ordered a flight and was disappointed that there were no stouts or stout-like beers amongst the offerings.  I ordered a root beer, and guess what, no root (birch) beer.  Wah wah!  My Uncle got a bowl of onion soup and pierogies, my Aunt (I am apologizing as I write this) ordered the Pittsburgh salad, and I ordered the quinoa salad.  I think of the three, my Uncle got the best lunch.  The pierogies are an appetizer but he received a fair number and he said they were v. good, along with the soup.  The Pittsburgh salad was the same as any salad you could get in any bar in Pittsburgh and at $17.50, severely overpriced.  My guinoa salad was a huge disappointment.  Quinoa was a garnish not the star.  The \"mixed greens\" were nearly all iceberg lettuce with a few v. small pieces of spinach.  There were about a teaspoon of corn and a teaspoon of black beans and about 6 grape tomatoes cut in half along with a few pieces of onion.  The \"dressing\" was about 8 dots around the plate.  So the salad was dry.  This was $13.50, again not especially tasty and overpriced.  Next time I will stick to the buffalo meatloaf, which really is quite good.  Service was good, she was capable but nothing spectacular.  Church Brew Works makes good beer, it makes predominantly mediocre, expensive beer with a few stars on the menu."}
{"text":"They did a wonderful job melding a brewery into an old church. One can definitely appreciate the intricate architecture thats gone into this place. There is detail in every nook and cranny to catch the eye. The beer is unique in taste and there seems to be a beer for everyone. There are other drinks if you arent a beer drinker and its even kid friendly as well. The food is not the boring norm. The homemade pierogies were delicious and the lamb meatballs with vodka sauce and ricotta are a welcome change to the taste buds. The chicken jambalaya was only slightly spicy but was packed with about a million different flavors. Even if you manage to try everything on the menu,  they have specials which feature unique items like rattlesnake or bison which is definitely not the norm on other restaurant menus."}
{"text":"How can you not like a restaurant that was remodeled from an old church. Large, antique organ, yet steel drums play in the hall. You sit at the bar with a range of in house brew, seasonal for all and a menu to match. Came here specifically for the pierogie special which happens once a year to be alligator. Spicy, unique, delicate. So happy. My favorite part of the process was that I was able to ask them via twitter when this pierogie was being served and received an answer in 30 minutes! so exciting.   What a staple of the Pittsburgh community, food and drink scene."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decent brews make this place worth a visit.  It just looks great, and the beers, while not the best, are good and inventive. Mint-milk stout? Not my favorite, but I love the attempt.   Beer prices are decent too.  I'd recommend coming in here and grabbing a drink or two at the bar.  There is one TV, but this is a more relaxed, family and/or dinner atmosphere.  The food is hit or miss.  The 7 onion soup is awesome, but at $4.50 a cup, it better be.  The pizza are pretty good, made in a wood fired oven.  The crust comes out doughy, but not too thick.  I had the chicken and chorizo pizza, it came out with huge chunks of chicken breast and a tiny dusting of the smallest pieces of chorizo I've ever seen.  The service was really slow all around here; took a while to get both drinks and food.  Far too long considering it wasn't even crowded when I visited.  Bottom Line: It's a cool place that warrants a visit. There are some good beers, but expect slow service."}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Pittsburgh!!!!!!!  Church Brew Works is the neatest restaurant I've ever been to. Talk about re-purposing an old, unused building! Let this be an example to all cities with churches (and buildings of any type) that are sitting unused and/or derelict. This restaurant gives \"re-purpose\" a whole new meaning.   Only downside with re-purposing a building like this is the acoustics. Because the walls and ceiling don't have any shock absorbancy, sound is not absorbed and it gets *very* loud in here! We came here late at night, 9pm on a Friday. It was packed and loud. The way tables and booths are laid out gives every party privacy without putting up huge dividers. It's reminiscent of being in a mess hall or what I think of a dining area to be like in Henry VIII's court back in the Middle Ages. Just an openness you don't get in most dining experiences.   The church has pews, stained glass and a pulpit area, which has also been re-purposed into a brewing station, which may or may not be considered blasphemous!   The food was very good, though a little on the stodgy side. I made the mistake of eating some of a pierogi appetizer that my companions ordered, forgetting that I had ordered the special that night which was cheese and potato pierogis. Way too heavy; I would have been better off eating a salad. I also tried some of the spinach and cheese dip, which was incredible!!!  Of course, the main attraction is the beer. And boy, do they make good beer! I had the Octoberfest, which seemed to be the most popular. It was the best I've had. Also tried the pumpkin beer, which was delicious, as well!  Can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Church Brew was excellent for grabbing a drink and watching a game in a unique environment. We were in town for a wedding and enjoyed the afternoon before the ceremony watching some college football in this beautiful church. Service was quick and attentive, and we enjoyed the pretzel with our beer. I must say -- even the bathrooms are cool. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Have been here many times food is very good, great selection of their beers. A fun place to gather. Out of town guests loved it!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend's birthday- trying to think of some place that will make him and his mom (who can be pretty picky) happy. I mentioned CBW and since it's been about 3 years since we last visited, we decided to check it out. It's a great place to take family who have never been there- the fact that it is a brewery in a church makes it a unique experience before you even order a drink or food item. Do not fret because it is in Lawrenceville- it's not in the hustle and bustle of Butler Street and they have their own parking lot. There is also straight parking available if need be.   The church itself is huge and it's beautiful. I LOVE that they were able to save this building and use it in such a creative way. Upon arriving, you have a choice between sitting in the bar area or dining area. We chose the dining area, but did ask our server for the bar menu as well (the pizzas and sandwiches were listed only on this menu). Since it has been a while for me, I decided to order the sampler- which allowed me to try 6 different beers. One complaint is that their beer menu is a little confusing to read and the paper they place the beers on do not state each beer they have. Our server named off the beers she gave me, but by the time I made it to the seasonals, I could not remember the names of the beers. Next time, I know to drink the seasonals first, when the names have not disappeared from my brain. Not to mention, their samplers are expensive- $9-$10 for 6 little beers. Although, I do have to say that their beer was pretty decent! None of their regular brews were strong and they all were easy to drink. Although I appreciated those qualities, I would have appreciated a little more complexity in their taste. One of the seasonals I tried was their thunderhop, which REALLY impressed me. Anything with fruity notes and hops, I usually love and this one was no different! The flavors were perfect.  My boyfriend wanted the corn dog appetizer to start. Three huge, fresh corn dogs were presented to us- with a spicy ketchup and a honey mustard on the side. We really enjoyed them and could tell they were homemade by their quality. For our meals, I ordered the pierogi sauté (potato and cheese pierogis with garlic cream sauce, tomatoes, broccoli and fresh herbs), the boyf ordered a steak sandwich with fries and his mom ordered the traditional  appetizer size pierogi. My original choice was the Caribbean chicken wrap, so long as the chicken could be warm, instead of chilled. My server explained that could not be done- which led me to assume the wraps were premade, which turned me off.   I was really impressed with my pierogis. The sauce was creamy and not overpowering with garlic, the pierogis were perfect and the broccoli and tomatoes were fresh and delicious. The fresh herbs brought all of the flavors together, making the entire dish absolutely delicious. The only odd thing was that the tomatoes were cold- which was a little offsetting. My boyf was not impressed with his steak sandwich and said it tasted like \"steak umms\". After looking at the steak, I would guess that he was right about that. He didn't hate it though and was able to eat it- but wouldn't order it again. His mom loved her traditional pierogis and raved about them the whole meal.   Our waitress gave us two boxes for our meals and even wrote what our dishes were, CBW and the date on each box. I found that to be extremely awesome and helpful!   Overall, I think this place is famous for their pierogis, pizzas and beer and I probably won't steer off of that path. Our service was great, the food was delicious and the beers were good- it was a very good experience.  PS--if you sign up for their e-mail mailing list, you get a free CBW pint glass! Pretty sweet deal!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful beer in the best room in the city....not to be missed.  Make it a point to get the bread pudding for dessert...and get it with the cinnamon ice cream, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"I'm crazy about their pierogis and bratwurst! I've sampled a million things like steak, lamb, French onion soup. shrimp and grits, buffalo cauliflower... I keep going back to my favs. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, I've been slacking. You need to check it out even if you aren't a beer drinker, it's still great :)"}
{"text":"Our feeder, who art in LoLa, Brew Works be thy name. Pittsburgh Salad come, my hunger be done. Ranch on fries as it is in heaven. Give us bruschetta, on tasty bread, and delicious basil pesto, as we ingest those made just for us. And deliver us some bread pudding, for thine is vanilla, the raisins, and the tasty forever. Amen.   For serious tho, best Pittsburgh salad ever. The breaded buffalo chicken was outstanding, filled with dark leafy greens, fresh sliced carrots and extra ranch on the side without even asking was a bonus.   My wife ordered the bruschetta and it was a showstopper. The bread was so good and through some black voodoo magic didn't get soggy the whole time even though it was covered in pesto, fresh ricotta and tomatoes. She also got jalapeño pierogis which aren't really my thing.   Finally the malted bread pudding with vanilla ice cream al a mode was a knockout punch.   Parking was easy and we got a spot by the front door. The atmosphere is super cool as its a beautiful old church that's been remodeled in such a way that it organically integrates the restaurant without feeling awkward. The server was good and attentive, also accommodating of our little munchkin who needed a spare plate and spoon.   I seldom give 5 stars to restaurants but this place earned it."}
{"text":"Just went back, still in awe of the place.    Wanted to throw my vote behind the smoked gouda spinach dip.  Quite tasty."}
{"text":"Let me start out with saying... when I order a wrap from a menu at a sit down restaurant, the only time it should be cold is when I am digging into my doggie bag the next day at lunch. Although it was tasteful, why was it cold?!?!   The only beer here worth your time is the seasonal xmas ale. The rest is meh.  And the server? HORRIBLE. He was completely rude to me the whole night. Even my boyfriend brought up that he was short. And I am not talking height here. I was a server once, I understand one gets \"in the weeds\" so to speak. But this guy had a snood comment for everything I tried to say, which to him, was only trying to order.   I think my issue with this place is I think the concept is so good that I want it to live up to it's expectations. Sadly, it does not."}
{"text":"One of the most striking restaurant settings I have encountered is the Church Brew Works in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is located in a former Catholic church and a large one at that. St. John the Baptist Church opened in 1907 in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Lawrenceville. But in 1993, with the consolidation of several Pittsburgh parishes, the church was closed and deconsecrated. The church building was purchased and repurposed as the Church Brew Works, opening in 1996. The renovation of the building retained many of its features, including the stained glass windows, a side chapel, the wooden floor, and the altar reredos. Tables and booths replaced the pews and brewery vats were placed in the altar area.  Entering the restaurant continues to give the feel of entering a church. It is a very striking picture and the size of the enterprise is surprising. Does the food match its setting? I'd say it does. We arrived for lunch and were seated nearly in the middle of the former nave. First off was a appetizer of Untraditional Pierogies appetizer. This zesty turn on the Polish (and Pittsburgh) staple featured chicken and a salsa topping. I ordered a Buffalo Burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and Susan the Traditional Pittsburgh Style Salad. The salad included grilled chicken, but Susan asked for it without the traditional French fries mixed in. The Buffalo Burger (made with Buffalo meat) was great! Cooked to a nice Medium and very tasty and juicy.  On a second visit, we came for dinner. I ordered a House Salad to start and Pierogie Sauté as a main. The Pierogie Sauté came with five pierogies in a cream sauce tossed with with broccoli and tomatoes. It was delicious! Too, it was not as heavy a meal as one might imagine.  The restaurant also has pizza and other very interesting sounding main dishes on its menu. As it is a brewpub, a number of draft and bottled beers are available, with featured brews listed on a chalkboard.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Very cool idea repurposing the church building into a brewery. Went with a group of 5 and everyone liked their drink. Had the beer sample flight, which was fun. It allows you to try their more popular beers before deciding on one to commit to. People in my group liked it. I'm not a beer fan, so I had a mango sangria, which was tasty. They do have a good number of non-beer choices for those who aren't beer fans. We also got two pizzas that were pretty scrumptious.   The good food/drink and the unique atmosphere make it somewhere worth checking out. I'm pretty sure this will be one of the places that I will be bringing friends visiting me in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It may feel slightly...different...dining in the middle of a church -- but if it's no longer being used as a house of worship, I think the restaurant is a wonderful use of a beautiful building that might otherwise be abandoned or no longer exist. (Read: I don't think Jesus minds. Just my opinion.) I love it here, and I try to convince my family to go every time I come home (I'm from Pittsburgh). We usually start with the spinach, feta and smoked gouda dip, which is delicious -- so rich, but so good. The hummus and wood-fired flatbread is also quite tasty. I normally order the grilled turkey and watercress salad, which has the most delicious cranberry dressing -- I always want to buy a bottle of it. The dried sweet potato curls are the perfect accent, too -- they add salt and crunch. All in all, this is an excellent meal salad -- it's hearty and filling. The staff has always been attentive and friendly, in my experience."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh, a group of us went to this restaurant. The food was good. I had the lamb meet balls and servers like of the features brews. My friends had the pierogis (polish dumplings). I tasted one and thought they were good. The room is loud and there is a lot of energy, so prepare yourself. It was a fun experience!"}
{"text":"The Church Brew Works in the former St. John the Baptist church on Liberty Ave is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere.  I've been here for lunch, dinner, happy hours, and special events (birthdays and wedding rehearsal dinners).  I don't even know where to begin.  They keep the place immaculate, and there really is no pun intended here.  It's gorgeous.  The atmosphere is unique, one could even say post-modern.  I could gush about the pleasure of having a tasty meal under a vaulting, airy ceiling with sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows... so I am.  I was raised Catholic in Pittsburgh and attended both the school and the church of St. Kieran's right up the road from here and, although not particularly holy myself now, have been broken hearted by how many of the gorgeous churches in the city were shuttered by the ruthless bishop, who ironically seems to have followed me to DC...  that's to say I think shutting down the spiritual centers of the inner city when they need them the most is more sacrilegious than turning one into a gorgeous restaurant and repurposing the building.  I digress to an absurd degree...the gouda dip appetizer is to die for here.  I crave it often  it's that good.  The pizza is truly delicious, and the Pittsburgh salad with chicken and fries on top is so much better than one could ever imagine just by thinking about that combo.  I get it with ranch and use it sparingly because the chicken is so flavorful and juicy.  Really, nothing here is bad - I've had the pierogies in many of their various daily forms and could easily make meals out of them they're that good.  They're \"real\" pierogies.  Delicious.  The chicken wrap was equally delicious, though I'm not sure if it's still on the menu.  Everything is fresh and simply seasoned but still tastes very sophisticated.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The Pious Monk beer is a must.  A must!  But if you don't drink alcohol, try their birch beer or ginger ale.  They make it all right there.  The ice cream is so good - I don't remember what's special about it, they use something left over from the brewing process like the sugar or something, but this with one of their absolutely delicious cups of coffee is the perfect way to end your meal.  Amazing.  I hope you'll love it.  Another place I'd recommend without reservation to out of towners - when I bring friends home to PGH with me I take them there and no one's been disappointed.    Oh, the outdoor patio is wonderful!  It's intimate and comfortable."}
{"text":"I will start by saying we didn't have anything to eat. However, the beer was good and the atmosphere was incredibly unique. Worth a stop."}
{"text":"Where can two babies and families go to eat a dinner without feeling like they're ruining everyone else's night?  Besides Applebee's.    The casual but darn cool atmosphere of Church Brew Works was a pleasant surprise for us out-of-towners.  We couldn't stand the wait for the restaurant side but, turns out, the seat-yourself bar side had free tables, the same menu and table service.  Sweet!  I ordered the Pittsburgh salad - a salad with french fries which the natives said is a Pittsburgh thing.  It was tasty but not particularly interesting besides the fact that there were fries on it.  The cheese and potato perogies we ordered were yummy as well.  The service was very nice.  The food wasn't outstanding but it was a nice change from some chain restaurants and pretty good overall.  My friends and husband enjoyed the beer and I hear good things about the pizza.  We were there for a while and didn't feel any pressure to leave as long as we kept ordering a beer or two."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, nothing too special but everyone was happy. Very fun atmosphere and really interesting place to go! I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Nice to see people not letting buildings with so much beauty and history to go to waste. They offer a nice selection of beer m, with an option for everyone. The food is diverse and creative as the space it occupies. Every bite offered a new layer of flavor in the buffalo burger, the house made chips were crisp not soggy as some can be that offered a flavor explosion that did more bite with every bite. Truly excellent quality food, beer and service.   Make it a must, on your Pittsburgh to do list.  Leave room for dessert. We had brewmisu, bread pudding and frozen peanut butter pie, they are worth saving room for."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place!  The food was really good the service was ok.  We got flights but the server didn't know a whole lot about the beers....kinda important at a Brewery!!  She was polite..but you kind of expect a knowledgeable.  We bought a couple pint glasses to take to some friends..........and specifically asked if the one we were purchasing would come without the sponsor logo that was printed on the table glasses...and were assured that we would get glasses with just Church Brew Works logos...but, low and behold our serve grabbed and wrapped up to of the table glasses that has another business logo on them....she was kind to wrap them up..but we then didn't discover the mistake until we were home in Ohio.....we did call the rest. and they went out of their way to ship us two new glasses!!!!  That was VERY nice.   So, our experience was not bad by any means...and with a little more time, I'm sure our server has learned the details and is providing not only friendly service, but now is much more knowledgeable.    We definitely recommend you give it a try.  The Church atmosphere is awesome, fun and a great job at re purposing!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty unique! The floors, stained glass windows and ceiling artwork were all restored to the original beauty. The brewing vessels are on display for viewing while you eat.  We ordered the cheese plate, which came with three local cheeses; the appetizer traditional pierogies; and the buffalo chicken pierogies! The pierogies were amazing, but the buffalo chicken pierogies may have been the best combination meal I have ever tried! We also ordered the beer sampler: it came with 7 of their homemade brews! Not a beer connoisseur, but I thought they were pretty unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Had not been to CBW in years,  Some old friends were back in Pgh and eager to visit as they are beer fanatics.  I'm not a beer guy -- scotch is my drink -- so I didn't go for the beers.  I was there for the food.  The pro:    - Service is good.  Attentive, prompt, friendly and very competent.  Even on a VERY crowded Saturday night when the place was absolutely packed.   The con:  - Bland and poorly done food.  The soup was tasteless.  The bison rib-eye was all gristle.  Wilted lettuce on the salad and if there was ANY dressing on it, I couldn't taste it.  The fries were typical dive-bar fare.  The only exception were the two pizzas at our table.  Both were very good.    So I guess if you're looking for great beer and tasty pizza, this is your place.  If you want good food, done well, head somewhere else.  HINT:  We had a reservation but were told that we'd have to wait about 30 minutes \"until our table was ready.\"  We saw a bunch of empty tables in the bar area and asked if we could wait there and have a drink (or three).  When the server arrived, she said that we could order from the full menu in the \"bar.\"  So if you're stopping by and the \"dining room\" is packed, head to the bar and have dinner there.  No difference!"}
{"text":"Personally, I love the Church Brew Works Happy Hour!  Half price appetizers with the exception of a few items and great brew prices. Their small beers are 12 oz, regular 16 oz, happy hour beers are 14 oz.  So normally a thunder hop IPA that goes for $4.21-12oz or $5.61-16 oz is only $3.74-14oz.  They have pizza by the slice for around $1.50.  I also have had dinner there numerous times; it's all very good.  Great restaurant, really cool place."}
{"text":"Forgive me Father for I have sinned. Thou shall not skip Church on Sat nights. I pray to the Brew Tanks of the Alter.                         Amen.  Sampler Tasting(8/$12+)  Celestial Gold, Pipe Organ Pale Ale, Pious Monk Dunkel,  Rotating Blast Furnance Stout, Belgium Style IPA,  Thunderhop IPA, Licorice Mint Lager.  Thou shall not lie.  I like Celestial Gold and Thunderhop most. Licorice Mint Lager be sacrilege to me tongue. Interesting place to booze. (+0.5 star)"}
{"text":"I've heard people talk of this place and thought to myself that I must go here one night.  The deal was sealed when my mom had told me she saw on national TV that it's one of the best places to eat in the Burgh.  She was salivating at the thought of a pirogi pizza.  So when my mom came down to cash in on her Mother's Day gift, my sister and I decided to bring her here to eat first.  There was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  Walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  And there is one about to happen.  When you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  You can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  Depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  We chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  Also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.  After looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  My mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  Sister decided on Yinzer Cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  And I couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  I also got a side of Belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  These pirogi were amazing.  I was a bit worried at first when I saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  The Belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  My mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  My sister's Yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  It's just a cheesesteak...Pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.  The service was top notch here too.  The server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The hostess when we walked in and I asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if I did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.  Everything in here is interesting to look at.  While we waited for our food, we just looked around a lot.  Each of us pointing at various items throughout the building.  Even the bathrooms were nifty.  I, however, cannot speak of the brews.  As I was driving, but I'm sure I will be back to partake in one or more."}
{"text":"Would give 4 stars for the location, ambience. .quite unique idea..converting an old Church in to a brewery restaurant . 4 stars for craft beers..I MUST  Confess. ..no pun intended. ..food sucks..I had the buffalo meatloaf, it wad served too dry over baked. My wife ordered the wayu steak..,was cold when served. ...kids had pizza, it was bit burnt too salty...disappointed .."}
{"text":"One of many microbreweries sprouting up in Pittsburgh.  Unique bar built in renovated Catholic church.   Food is good.  Beer is great.  Brewing in a confessional may be a ticket to hell though :)  Protect your soul, drink slowly.  Bless me father ..."}
{"text":"We were told our table would be ready in 10-15 minutes. No problem. Told the hostess we were going to the bar and to let us know. 25 minutes later nothing. Went back to ask when our table would be ready. She said she thought we were staying at the bar. WTF??? Finally was seated and started to review the menu. A lot of strange dishes. Wild boar for example. No waitress came by to greet us or take a drink order. After 25 minutes we gave up and left. Complained to the manager. She was very nice and offered to rectify and address the service situation, but we had decided to leave regardless. First impressions. Now I'm stuck with a gift card."}
{"text":"The place is excellent. Really well done inside. Untraditional perrogies were very tasty as was the beet root salad. The flight was well worth it and the sign up membership for 2 free glasses was worth it. Would recommend for the experience. Some food like the burgers looked basic though although based on viewing only."}
{"text":"April 2011 Finally made it back to Pittsburgh and Church City Brew Works. It is still delicious. This time I had the chicken slaw melt and fries with beer cheese sauce. My friend had the watercress salad with shrimp, she loved the house dressing and was tempted to lick the little container. So it was that good. For dessert we had the coconut cake and raspberry ice cream. Turns out it was basically a coconut cupcake and ice cream. Still good just unexpected. It was also very spongy. Service was great and ambiance as fun as ever."}
{"text":"Pros: if you like beer the get the flight. It's $15 for all. And they're good.   Pro: BEAUTIFUL. and historic. Must see for tourists who like to drink.   Cons: I went on a Sunday afternoon and received very slow service. Perhaps they are understaffed at this time. I sat at the bar and only one persons was working. We waiting a long time to order and for her to check on us so we could ask for napkins about ten minutes after we got out food.   More cons: the 'pomme frites with sriracha mayo' are made well but SOOO salty. I got nauseous with the saltiness and used napkins (my own since we waited forever for someone to get napkins) to wipe off the salt. Make sure you ask for less or no salt if you order.   More cons: wifi is spotty"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere if you haven't been to something like this before. The old church is definitely something you don't see transformed into a brewery every day. The staff was plenty friendly, and knowledgeable enough about the numerous beer offerings they offer. The beers I tried were all good. The menu has some really intriguing offerings, and you can tell it was designed by an innovator chef. The dinners I had themselves were somewhat average, and not necessarily executed well. The crag dog appetizer had good flavor but I got significant shells in almost every bite. The jambalaya was also really interesting but the rice has numerous undercooked, crunchy pieces that made it difficult to eat. Honestly, you may be better off going to the pub and getting some of the pretty good bar food items, like a burger. Overall, cool place, decent food, good beer and reasonable prices make this a worthwhile trip to make for people visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Okay, it smells weird in here - musty church + beer brewing? But the atmosphere and the awesome beer and food make up for it.  Pierogies are awesome, the pierogie pizza is good (is it sacrilege that I want to add bacon or sausage to it?) The seven onion soup is heavenly as is the bread pudding.  As for the beer, I can only comment on the Millenium Trippel because once I had it, I did not want for anything else. It was that good.   Minus a star for Pepsi products....(when I ask for a Coke, tell me you have Pepsi so I can change my order. I can tell.)"}
{"text":"The Church Brew Works has a fantastic atmosphere based on the idea of turning an old Catholic church into a brewery. The venue has a large area to seat its customers for dinner where the congregation previously sat in the church. They also have a bar located in the back left of the establishment.  Unlike our previous trips, we sampled their food menu as well as their beers. While dining, we sampled their Italian Perogies, gumbo, French onion soup, and buffalo steak. Everything was good and had good taste. However, not the best I had through my experiences.  The beer was fantastic. As an IPA lover I sampled the hoppiest beer they had in house and was happy with the brew.  In summary, this is a good microbrew and restaurant in an extremely creative atmosphere. Your dining experience here is more based on novelty than quality, but I'd surely recommend joining the \"congregation\" at this church!"}
{"text":"I can drink beer in church!?!?! That is the appeal of Church Works, drinking in a church converted into a brewery. The pierogis.....delicious. That is what I want to eat every damn day. I was pretty bummed the coconut beer was not available and instead tried the licorice flavored stout (sorry, poor memory and I can't remember what it was called). I wasn't too fond of it and my sadness over the coconut beer was probably pouring into the beer. My gf and I snacked and only had the pierogi, side salad, and beers but we mostly went to say we drank beer in church.  And there are PEWS in the ladies's restroom!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a little over priced. But you pay for the fact that you're eating in such a neat atmosphere. I had the Buffalo chicken ravioli and man oh man was it delicious! Super spicy, so if you don't like heat I wouldn't recommend it. But I loved it ! And our waiter was a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"I'd probably give it 3.5 but I'll give them the bump. The service was good. We had a party of 16 and the waitress did a fantastic job.   The atmosphere is in a huge old church in Polish Hill. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork with fries. I thought the portions were a tad small but that's ok.   The beer I had was their Irish Red. It was excellent. I'd highly recommend it. The other people at my table enjoyed their beer as well. All the drinks looked delicious.   My only slight gripe was we were there for a birthday and brought our own cake. They cut our cake for us but then charged every person in the party $2 for doing so. So, that's $32 for cutting the cake and putting it on a small plate? That's crazy. I think that should be free considering we dropped close to $800 as a group. Oh well."}
{"text":"Very awesome place. Historical landmark. Almost felt kind of weird drinking at a church! I liked it though! Nice beer selection, had the traditional perogies & buffalo cauliflower. Both were good but very oily and filled with salt.   It took a while for us to get served but our waitress was the sweetest, and made our experience great! I would definitely recommend this location for anyone traveling to the Pittsburgh area looking for something different to do."}
{"text":"Okay so once you get pass the fact that you are drinking in a church, you will be amazed on how great the food is and how cheap the drinks are. I order the pepperoni rolls and pulled pork nachos. Both were equally fantastic. I really enjoyed my time there, the atmosphere and vibe was very laid-back. Also they have TVs so you can watch sports. There custom crafted beers are what really makes this place a must go."}
{"text":"Awesome place to put a brewery. We were lucky that our hotel's shuttle would take us there and pick us up, because getting a cab on a Saturday is, apparently, impossible.  Food was... Meh. Beer was decent (I didn't love most of them). Service was also OK. She wasn't wonderful, but she was fairly attentive."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here! Who wouldn't want to drink in an old Catholic church? I wasn't too crazy about the beer, so I only had one. The food was pretty decent. I had a chicken wrap that was served cold with a vinaigrette and it was tasty. I also had rattlesnake pirogies. They were weird. There were two lively gentleman playing polka music which was entertaining.  This was a solid place, and I liked it. I would go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The layout of the restaurant is super cool cause they literally took a high-ceiling church building and transformed it into a brewery!   Very family-friendly environment even for younger kids because the bar section is partitioned off a bit to the side. Extremely spacious with friendly staff and service.   The food is affordable - a bit on the pricier end but for the quality of food that you're getting, it's definitely worth! Would recommend this place to others!   *Came here for a company recruiting event (they know what's good!!)"}
{"text":"My expectations were shattered.   This place has the best potential ... NEVER realized.    The ambiance was sad.  They could do so much better. The service was just ok. The food was awful. They only brew 3 beers, and only serve those 3 on tap.  We had the daily special perogies.  They were grose. We had the 5 cheese pizza.  It was slightly burnt, and the bottom was all icky black from a dirty pizza oven.  So it tasted like burnt crust dust.  This place looks like it'll be cool .. don't get fooled."}
{"text":"I was going to give them a 3, but then I remembered how delicious the beer was. The Octoberfest especially was soooo good.   Food was delicious! The thai chili wings were some of the best wings I've had. You MUST try the wood-fired pizza.   Atmosphere is awesome, but the service on a Saturday night was pretty slowww. I would definitely go back but not on a Saturday if I wanted to sit down and eat dinner."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, and the room is difficult to carry on a conversation in.  The building is neat."}
{"text":"Really neat atmosphere. We had the original pierogis and they were delicious. We also had the bbq nachos - would probably not get those again. I agree with other reviewers that when you first get there it seems as if the staff is a bit confused what to do if you didn't make a reservation, but we got seated pretty quick so no big deal. I don't think I'd make this a regular spot but a cool place to bring someone who is visiting Pittsburgh for the first time."}
{"text":"The pierogies are great. After that it's pretty standard bar food. Not bad. Not great. Lots of good beers which are hard for me to rate honestly as I am more of a bourbon type. The concept is the best thing about this place. Worth going to probably not worth going back."}
{"text":"I came here during a business trip to Pittsburgh. I'll admit, it felt sacrilegious drinking beer in a church and moreover, a beer called \"unholy matrimony\" (one of the seasonal brews). The novelty of the place is that it still looks very much like a church inside, with the exception of brewing vats taking the place of the alter and a brick oven replacing the bishop's throne, etc.  The service from our waiter was excellent (comped us free soup because our food was taking longer than expected) and the hostess was very accommodating in trying to get us seated as quickly as possible (the place was packed).  Definitely try any of the brick oven pizzas. Our group of 8 ordered all of them and no one was disappointed.   Bottom line: CBW has tasty in-house brews and excellent brick oven pizzas even the most pious of protestants will enjoy."}
{"text":"Staff very friendly-we showed up with a group of 8 on a busy night with no reservation and they could accommodate us! Knowledgeable servers, good beer, generous portion sizes. Church setting is impressive -nice atmosphere for casual dining."}
{"text":"There is a definite unique vibe in this place.  Having a brewery/restaurant in an old church is pretty interesting and makes for a great atmosphere.  The food here is pretty good.  There are some interesting items on the menu.  Pros: Great location Private parking lot Food is tasty Service is always good The Brewmisu dessert is fantastic  Cons: It can be a bit pricey for the type of food The beer is good, but not fantastic Because it's an old church the smell of old wood sort of envelops the air  All in all, it's a fun place to visit.  If you have family or friends from out of town, they'll enjoy the uniqueness of the place."}
{"text":"The building= 5 stars  Drinking beer at a church= seems a little blasphemous but a unique experience (4 stars)  Service= The waitress was NO help in explaining any dishes or what was popular, and we didnt have enough place settings at a large booth for only 4 people (2 stars)  Food= nothing special at all...maybe I should have waited the hour and a half for a pizza, but my stomach wasnt down for that.  I had jumbalaya, my sis had some sandwich, and we got perogies which were somewhat tasty (2.5 stars)  Beer= asked for a glass and gave me a pint...Just wanted to try it because I was at a brewery, and I didnt even finish it.  (2 stars)  Ambiance= had this weird, hoaky vibe to it that I couldn't quite explain. (3 stars)  Overall, the only thing this place has going for it is the fact that you can have beer in a church...and the building is historical."}
{"text":"This bar is about 11 miles outside of the city.  It is an interesting concept to be brewing beer on the alter!  The beer was all good and the food was great pub type food.  Pizza was crispy with a light crust.  Pierogi s were tasty!  This place is huge!  The stain  glass windows were beautiful.  I am glad I got to see this place.  There are better pizza spots in Pittsburgh so I don't think I'd go back there for pizza but it's definitely a place to check out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. Cool atmosphere and HUGE. We ordered 3 appetizers: spinach and artichoke dip, chicken lettuce wraps, and the mussels. The dip was incredible and not runny and oily like it can be at a lot of places. The lettuce wraps were good and had a lot of flavor but the portion size was dinky to the extreme. Like a tiny little condiment bowl of chicken. The mussels had good flavor but were cooked too long.   I then got the seven onion soup bowl and it was AMAZING and my boyfriend and I shared a pizza-the mushroom and pesto one. The pizza was so good and perfectly cooked.   We each had several beers-mostly Oktoberfest and their IPA. Several so they were obviously worthy of multiples.   Next time I'd really like to check out the outdoor area-it looks really beautiful."}
{"text":"I was staying in downtown Pittsburgh for work and had Church Brew Works on a list of places I wanted to visit while in town. I am glad I made the trip! It's set up really beautifully inside with the stained glass windows, the vaulted ceilings and the original organ.  I ordered the beer flight, which I really enjoyed! And the buffalo cauliflower - I am not a huge fan of blue cheese, but it was the perfect pairing with the buffalo sauce. Very delicious!  If you have the chance It is worth visiting, even if only for a quick drink!"}
{"text":"Always on my list of places to take people that are not from Pittsburgh.  The best things to get are beer and pizza (on the bar menu) for sure.  They have full dinners as well but they are a bit pricier and maybe it's just me but I feel like a trip to the Church Brew Works is not complete without the pizza!  The beer is also quite good.  They have a few that our always on tap and then do seasonal beers as well.  The coolest thing about this place of course is the fact that is it an old church.  You would not even know it was a restaurant if you happen to miss the sign in front (not on) the building.  They left almost everything as it was.  It still feels like you are in a church.  You still walk through the vestibule when you come in from the street and church benches are still used for seating.  Such a cool place, you have to see it."}
{"text":"This place is over rated and just not good.  More of a tourist attraction than a good restaurant. Beer is good.  Food here is expensive and they use sub-par ingredients.  Many other options nearby in Lawrenceville that are top notch."}
{"text":"The food is good, but it's not worth the price. I ordered a pork chop which was a little dry but had good flavor. It was paired with some pretty good polenta and slices of poached pear. We tried the perogies on special which were roasted garlic, black bean and tomato with a chipotle aioli. It was 4 dry and fairly flavorless perogies, very disappointing. We also got the steak on special which was very good. The house grits were very flavorless and lacking cheese taste. I had a Manhattan that was on special, pretty good not the best. Also the titos mule was good but very sweet. We had a couple beers that were good so I suggest trying their beer. The atmosphere is the best part. I suggest going here for beers and maybe appetizers but not dinner. Very pricey."}
{"text":"This place is huge. Our friend recommended it as one of the better breweries in town and then mentioned that it was in an old church. We were sold on that. We got there and the place is just enormous. The tanks are set up at the altar and are the first thing you see. We were seated in just a few minutes and everyone found something on the menu that they liked.  I had the Chapple sandwich (chicken apple bacon sandwich) and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich. The Chapple was tangy and delicious. The perfect taste for a sandwich of that makeup. I upgraded the fries to sweet potato, and was a little disappointed with them though. They were seasoned a bit heavily with just salt and pepper. (lighter seasoning and cinnamon is never a bad choice for sweet potatoes)  The beers were excellent. They were out of the Pipe Organ IPA, but we represented most of what they had on draft and everyone liked what they got -- Thunderhop IPA, Dunkel, and Cool Guy IPA.  On a final note, we were a little dissatisfied with the time it took to flag down our server after we had finished to pay for our meal. Other than that we were very pleased with the service. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I've tried to love this place. I went back after a lackluster first experience (summed up by \"liked the beer, hated the food\"), I thought their menu looked great, and figured I'd try it again. To start, the service was awful. While FOUR hosts/servers chatted about their weekends, we waited about 10 minutes by the \"wait to be seated\" sign, until we finally flagged someone down. \"Oh, I thought someone already helped you\", they responded. Nope.  We met some friends for dinner, and ordered some beer. The waiter (a different individual from the four at the front) dropped his pen into my beer. And did not offer to replace it. I was not happy, but figured hey, it won't kill me...the beer was okay, not great. We'll blame it on the ink.  We ordered appetizers, bruschetta and a lentil mushroom ball. Both were very tasty! Our friends ordered sangria (delicious), and cask ale (also very good).   My husband got the shrimp and grits, which was smoky and creamy. I ordered a beet salad with roast chicken, and my friends got a cheese pizza we all shared. The chicken was RAW in the middle. I don't mean \"a little pink, could have been cooked more\" ... I mean could have still probably been revived by a skilled veterinarian. I sent it back. The waiter looked surprised and apologized. A manager came over and said \"the kitchen usually cooks the chicken all the way\"...well I hope so! He did not charge me for the raw chicken, though they did offer a replacement, which I declined.  Thankfully the pizza was good, so I didn't leave hungry.  They did not comp the beer, or offer anything other than a VERY halfhearted apology. I'm disappointed by the service, and incredibly disappointed by the food. Offering a customer raw chicken, without a reasonable recovery and very sincere gesture is pretty unforgivable.   I gave one additional star for our dinner companions' experience, which was decent, even though ours was awful."}
{"text":"This is such an awesome place to eat. It is in an old Roman Catholic church. The atmosphere is great, and the food is just as good! I ordered the brick oven pizza, and it was delicious. The beer is pretty good as well. On all the glasses, it says, \"And on the eighth day, man created beer.\" I love it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has steadily gone downhill in the past few years, at least by my experiences. It is a go-to spot for inventive vegan and vegetarian options, as well as Pittsburgh salads and sandwiches. However, it seems as though the portions have gone way down and the prices have gone way up. I was appalled to learn that they upcharged $6 for salmon for a salad. I am allergic to their pre-marinated chicken, so I didn't really have a choice. I was expecting a big bowl of greens and a nice portion of salmon, but it was pretty meager. The salad, in the end, was $19.5! For a pub-style salad! I had 2 drinks as well, and my bill, before tip ended up being $35 for just me. That's a bit ridiculous for this style of restaurant.   My friend did enjoy her zucchini noodle \"spaghetti\" with lentil, mushroom meatballs! It was a fun twist on a classic favorite and vegan to boot! However, it wasn't enough to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"This place has everything going for it - the ambience, the food, the price and the great service. The beer was fantastic. I enjoyed the play on the concept of having the brewing tanks at the altar, which contributes to the fact that they consider beer to be truly the most important part of this place. I had a Belgian style beer which has a slightly higher alcohol percent (11%) but it was absolutely delicious! Our server was very good with describing what the beers tasted like for us (I am not the kind of person that justGETS it from the name, but I don't like very hippy tasting beers). The Trippel was also delicious. Couldn't get to the chocolate vodka cocktail but that sounded heavenly. Food was great, they do a great job with the perougies so that is worth trying for sure. Their portobello pesto pizza was brilliantly made!! Thank you wood-fired oven!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is 1 of a kind.  Maybe it's because I'm Jewish, but I've never seen a Church with a Brewery inside.    Additionally, the architecture is unbelievable.  The jambalaya was delicious, but a bit overpriced (given the type of restaurant, in my opinion).   Alternatively, the wood-fired brick oven pizzas never disappointed!   The beers always satisfied my picky craft-only-beer-drinking boyfriend.  The service wasn't always 100%, but it never hindered us from returning with high hopes!"}
{"text":"For the life of me, I don't understand some of the less than positive reviews on here.   It smells like a brewery? It is a brewery! You didn't like the beer? Did you try all 12 on tap? The place is more than accommodating with samples, they want you to find a brew to your taste!  I particularly love their Oktoberfest and Maibock.   I have eaten at CBW several times and enjoyed each meal. I tend to eat the appetizers, pizza, and sandwiches, as opposed to the entrees. Very much enjoy the food and find it to be very consistent.   The service is always on point.   No I don't work at CBW, I am a local who eats and drinks there every couple months, and values this unique neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I saw Church Brew Works on some sort of Buzzfeed-type list which coincided nicely with a visit to Pittsburgh happening a week later, and so I decided to give it a shot.  I figured the chances of me catching fire in a deconsecrated church were much lower than in a regular church, and there was beer. Check and check.  Overall?  Novel, but overrated.  Everything from the exterior of the building and the faux-billboard sign to the bar and brewing equipment in altar/sanctuary area inside the church is a bit of a head trip to see and experience, but once you get past the novelty of it all, the food and beer itself is pretty average.  A colleague I was visiting in Pittsburgh put it best by saying 'it's a place you only visit once, usually with friends from out of town'.    A group of colleagues and I visited Church Brew Works on a Wednesday at 7pm, and the beer wasn't the only thing that was hopping here (it was pretty busy).  We were seated immediately (reservation), however it took us about 20+ minutes to get the first round of drinks after we ordered them.  I don't know what took so long - perhaps he had to climb all the way up to the belfry to fetch them? Regardless, instant strike one. They have about 15 beers to choose from - 25% seasonal and 75% fixed) and you can also order sampler flights of up to 8 beers. I sampled 4 or 5, and really didn't find any of them to be very impressive.  The rotating coffee stout I ordered was pretty boring, although I did enjoy the pale ale.  Unfortunately it took me another 20 minutes to get it after ordering.  Seriously, what's the deal with a brew pub not being on top of drink orders?  Strike two.  I will say that despite the delay, our server was very friendly and helpful.    We ordered food, and I got the bison corn dogs (yum!) and the boar jambalaya (meh).  I've never eaten either meat, and I was happy for the opportunity.  The corn dogs were breaded and cooked perfectly, and came with honey mustard and ketchup condiments.  The jambalaya was not very impressive.  Actually, it was boring. It was more of a rice dish than an actual jambalaya, which was disappointing. My friend really liked the pierogies, and all of the desserts were well-received.  I liked the bread pudding that I sampled off of someone else's plate.   The server split the check 10 ways for us without asking, so that was a nice plus. I found some of the dishes to be a bit overpriced for what they were, but perhaps you're also paying for the novelty of it all? (and maybe the heating bill for a church in late November).  I recommend visiting this place for the novelty, but a place with 'Brew Works' in the name needs to have better beer for me to give it a better review."}
{"text":"Finally! A church serving something other than stale bread and red wine. How novel! Go for a drink or two and the aura of being in sin, but there are better beers and food to be had elsewhere in the area."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! I have been in PA  since Sunday and finally decided to venture out and try something local. I came across this place before and was curious so here goes. Walking in felt really weird due to being a church but once I got inside it was awesome, so unique! I decided to sit at the bar because I was there by myself and the place is huge and probably one of the craziest places I have been before. i started with their crab dip, not my favorite but it was still pretty good then I enjoyed two of their beers, an IPA and a Pale ale both tasted great. The bartender was very friendly and provided good feed back on places around the area and the beer they had. I really wanted to try their buffalo perogies but was so full from the beer that I took them to go, I am SO glad I did that! Just finished eating them and they were everything I hoped they would be! If I were in town longer I would definitely come back here to try different food and beers!   * a little on the pricey side BUT at least the food, beer, service, and experience made up for that so if you dont mind spending a little its worth it :)"}
{"text":"I got here on a Thursday shortly after they opened, around noon. Parking is around back, there is some on the street but not much.   Took a seat at the bar and had their lunch burger special, it seemed like it would be spicy based on the menu but wasn't too much burn. Overall the burger was good and made a nice meal. The beer is all brewed on site and I tried a couple drafts. The Thunderhop IPA was good as was the Absolution Ale."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and fabulous bartenders.   It's a little loud on Friday and Saturday nights, but as long as you're alright with that bit, you'll love this place as well."}
{"text":"Good food great atmosphere as long as you don't mind being in a church... or a place that used to be a church"}
{"text":"I was back here over the holidays and I feel like I really needed to update this review to distinguish my previous rating about the food and the beer. First off, once again I tried several of their beers. Their rotating stout was a chocolate-mint and I found the mint flavor absolutely undesirable. I also tried a seasonal brown and was thoroughly disappointed. However, they did have a bottle-only IPA (the Thunderhop) that was drinkable. But once again, I would rate the beer  2 or 3 stars.  However, the food was absolutely phenomenal. We started with the hummus (good) and the spinach, feta, and smoked Gouda dip (phenomenal). Then for my lunch, I had, literally, the best French onion soup of my life. For anyone that makes it to the Church Brew Works I cannot say enough that you MUST TRY THE FRENCH ONION SOUP.  I also tried the nontraditional pierogies, which, were a green chile, cheddar and chorizo. These too were excellent.  So overall, the beer is a bust but the atmosphere and food make this place worth of a rating bump."}
{"text":"We just spent a weekend in Pittsburgh and heard from several people that we had to try the Church Brewery!  I'm glad we did.  We went with a good sized group (7 of us) and sat outside - initially.  We ordered a few beer samplers and hummus to start - hummus never came, but we didn't care b/c we also got the special perogies.    Then - the rain came - the manager opened the fancy-shmancy awning....to no avail - the rain kept coming down harder.  Just as our server was bringing our entrees - we were making our way inside to avoid the deluge.  Fortunately we had no problem getting an inside table to enjoy our meals.  Our vegetarian friends weren't impressed at all with their meals (it's definitely more meat-friendly of a menu).  However, my partner and I shared:  appetizer perogie, crab cake entree, and a side of poblano mac and cheese.  We ate every last little nibble - and it was all fantastic.    The beers were very good too!  All of this was just capped off by the beautiful architecture and decor within the old church.  Next time we're in Pittsburgh, we're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Great atmosphere. Good selection of craft brews!  What a great idea of putting a micro brewery in an old church."}
{"text":"The beer is great.  The location is amazing.  The atmosphere is the best around.  There are huge, shiny, copper beer casks on the altar, as if to offer their delicious beer to the gods.   Or something.  The pierogies are delicious.  The rest of the food is hit or miss, but when it hits it is great. And of course, it's a brewpub in a church, which makes it memorable, hilarious, and fun."}
{"text":"This was definitely a cool experience. It was once a church, turned in to a brewery. We were with kids, so it is very kid friendly. They had high chairs and it was comfortable. The place is so cool looking. You can take pictures up by where the altar once was which was neat. The beer flight was great so you got to taste all the different beers. I like the lighter ones. The heavier ones were a bit much for me, but that is not my thing. There is a description for all of them. The food was good. Pierogies, mussels, fish, etc. A nice variety. Good prices. The atmosphere was very different which made it great. It is street parking but we didn't have a problem with that."}
{"text":"Pros: great food (love the un-traditional pirogies), great beer, great service, cool ambiance - it's not just housed in a church, but a pretty impressive-looking one if I do say so myself. My dad got a kick out of waiting in a pew to be seated.  Cons: no smoking in the pub area (although I understand not wanting to damage the church with prolonged cig exposure), and a bit pricey for the quality of fare. They try to straddle Pittsburgh food and NY sophistication to middling success.  I always bring out-of-town visitors here for dependably good food and beer with a bit more excitement than is found in most of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Is a place where you feel  welcome give you a sense of relax is a warm place and invite you to calm down . impress me that most  people give respect and talk low. For what is to be a church is now a landmark historic place  of Pittsburgh but now is a restaurant . Overall good food."}
{"text":"The most outstanding thing about this place is the feel.  When it first opened, it was too well lit, and had antiseptic tables.  Since then it has begun to capitalize more on its clerical provenance--dimming the lights and making it a bit mysterious.  This is very much a fun/interesting place to eat.  I think that the food is decent, and the beer very reasonable in quality.  Ultimately though people come here for the overall experience.  We had some friends from Chicago come here to visit who were very Catholic, they had a great time eating there (although they felt like they needed to go to a confessional)."}
{"text":"They have a good beer selection of which they make themselves. They had rattlesnake pierogies the first time I went.  Interesting to say the least but had a nice kick and enjoyed them. The pierogie pizza is awesome. i  have been there twice now and will make it a point to return."}
{"text":"On a personal level, when this place was still a church, my aunt got married here. It's also where my dad had his First Holy Communion.  And walking through those thick wooden doors, Church Brew Works still retains the elegant, ornate beauty of a church, with pews as booths and the alter being home to the brewery equipment. A lot of the original stained glass is there too. It's breathtaking.  One drawback to the atmosphere is the constant echo of conversations. It can difficult to hear people talking at your table if it's busy.  Service is good, but it can be damn slow, especially if anyone at your table orders a wood fired pizza. Expect at least a 30-minute wait from the time you order. They're tasty, but a pain if you want to get in and out fast. Pierogi fillings are often novelty and overpriced. (I think at one point they had shark meat stuffed ones?) Not my favorite when there are many, more traditional pierogi options in the city.  Sandwiches are OK and desserts are decent, particularly the bread pudding. I ordered the seasonal pumpkin bread pudding to share and it was awesome. It was very decadent with layers of flavor.  I've never had the beer, but they also brew pop. I once was a huge fan of the birch beer, similar to a root beer, but the quality has gone down over time. It was once more flavorful; it's tasted more watered down during more recent visits. They usually brew one other pop. One time it was cherry soda. Another time it was cream soda.  It's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone. The food is OK, but not particularly memorable."}
{"text":"A great location for a brewery!  Literally a converted church with pretty good beers.  The flight is a great way to try most of their beers and a pretty good price. We were able to relax there for a couple hours without a problem.  Only had the pierogi shut they were pretty good!"}
{"text":"Went over the weekend, and I'm still having fantasies about those Buffalo Chicken Pirogies! We went on a Sunday evening and got seated within seconds. Our server was phenomenal, super sweet & attentive. We both got beer, and split the pirogies & pepperoni roll and days later are both craving everything we ate. We will definitely be back next time in Pittsburgh! Glad we checked it out."}
{"text":"So so cool. Great repurposing of an abandoned church. The stained glass windows and pews make it hard to believe that this is a working brewery. Not only is the site awesome, but so is the selection of beers. A must see stop for any beer fan."}
{"text":"Worse service I've had in a long time.  Food and beer are meh especially for the prices.  Stop in and take a few pictures or at most at happy hour and move on.  Relic from the 90's craft beer boom, needs new owner and management ASAP."}
{"text":"My prayers were answered - BEER!    We arrived on a Saturday Afternoon for lunch and some beers.    I had read up on this place and was pretty amped to drink beer in a church.    I had read many good things about on Yelp.  I like this place but was not overwhelmed (more like undewhelmed :-( - I had high expectations)  There is nothing wrong with the establishment and i will go back.  They make their own beer in this big church.   I ordered quite a few and found the beers to be \"okay\".   My Pitt Native friend mentioned to me that his favorite beer was not currently available so I will need to revisit and rewrite my review.  Food - We ordered a couple of small pizzas.   The first pizza we tried was the Pirogie pizza.   It was pretty much flavorless (pizza, no sauce, with mash potato dumpings, covered with cheese)...   I had higher expectations.   The second pizza was pretty good.  Please note in Pittsburgh - there are some good pubs that serve great pizza - this is not one of those pubs.  All and all - nothing was bad but nothing was great.    I will be back and try some more items and rewrite my review."}
{"text":"Coming back to Pittsburgh with my boyfriend after 2 years, this is the first place I took my Pittsburgh naive boyfriend. Best. Idea. Ever.   We got there around 6 PM on a Friday night, just barely avoiding the rush. As you walk in, you are struck by the contrast of a bar in a church. It is exactly what it sounds like and it takes a moment to absorb that fact. The stained glass is gorgeous and gives the place an authentic gothic atmosphere.   We had gotten the house beer which was light and hoppy. I am not a huge beer fan but even then, I still appreciate the taste. Never tried pierogies, we had gotten the pierogi appetizer as well as a pierogi pizza. In his words, \"pizza has been ruined forever\".  The best part is that we were able to get free beer glasses by signing in on an app (I am blanking on the nape of the app but it is advertised on the tables). Definitely ask about it!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day. I had the shrimp etoufee, which was a little pricey for lunch at $13.50. I was hoping it was going to be a decent size portion, but it was on the smaller side. It was pretty good, but it was small and there wasn't much shrimp in it. I had a feeling it was going to be a smaller entree, so I went ahead and ordered a side of fries to get started. I should have asked first, but I didn't, and go figure, the fries are frozen (ie, not hand-cut). Personally, I feel, restaurants at this price range should be serving hand-cut fries standard. They do have Frank's hot sauce though, which is a plus always. I did not have any beer this day, so this review is only for the food. Service was decent, though I did have to ask for water a couple times before I got a refill at one point."}
{"text":"Very cool place.  We visited there while in Pittsburgh for work.  Good beer and food."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with great service. It is huge and something amazing to see. Good was great and the beer was cold- loved the sampler."}
{"text":"One of the neatest places I've ever been!  It's amazing how they transformed a church into a brewery/restaurant and still were able to keep the decor.  It is awesome in there.  Great food and the beer is awesome!  Good parking.  Good service!  Definitely a great place to eat in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"3.5 is about right. The first time I went to Church I was not at all impressed with the pork chop I got--it was dry and bland.   On subsequent trips with friends, I got the Jambalaya and the tomato/basil pizza, and both were pretty good.  The pizza was a nice size for the price, the chips and the beer were also decent.  However, the waitress did not pay attention at all it seemed.  I finished my water and did not get a refill for the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"Love yourself enough not to drink here.  If you have to dine here, do yourself a favor and only order a pizza--the pizzas are actually quite excellent.  Why the single star review?  This place has EVERYTHING going for it, all the ingredients for an awesome restaurant are there, and yet the Church Brew Works still completely fails.    Their beer is awful.  I know a thing or two about making beer and here it the thing:  You need to hire a brew master experienced enough to know WHEN beer is finished, and I can also tell that this beer is 'messed around with' too much during the brewing process.  get a better brew master, seriously.  NONE of these beers taste finished.  Not one.  At best, the IPA is kind of alright.  the rest of the beers just smell like urine, and they dont taste much better either.  oh--and the restaurant STINKS inside.  its the yeast they use for the beer, but it's off putting.  The last time I dined there, I ordered the meat loaf and it took forever to come to the table and when it did arrive, it was cold and it had sat so long in the kitchen that a skin had formed on the gravy.  Yuck.  our waiter was an asshole.  Very patronizing, to the point where I almost said something.   I WANT to like this place.  I really do.  It's lovely inside and it always seems like its going to be great when you first walk in.  Every single time this place dissapoints me."}
{"text":"Most overrated place in Pittsburgh, in my opinion. Their beer is nothing special. Neither is their food. And their service is routinely awful. If you're looking for a cool, unique Pittsburgh experience, I'd recommend Fat Heads or Hough's over this ANY day."}
{"text":"I want to rate the food excellent and the service terrible, but I'll round up, since the atmosphere is cool.   The food was wonderful. Everything we got (especially the pierogi of the day, which was avocado, potato, cheese, and chives, I think) was great! The guys enjoyed the beer they drank (I don't drink beer), though they were out of a lot of the beers they tried to order. My Hawaiian mimosa was yummy, but getting my second one took a lot of work. My friend actually went to track her down after it hadn't come in ages and we hadn't seen her. It's a neat restaurant and I'd go back, but apparently their pizza is really great and though it's still on their website, they do NOT have pizza at this time. Their oven burned. Not sure if they're going to have pizza in the future or not.  Also, many of our menus had extra pieces of menus for food that was no longer available that day and we only got 2 of the menus with the sandwiches on them for our entire party (6). Another area where the service lacked in addition to the poor waitress."}
{"text":"In my opinion the food is terrible. They got rid of the pizzas -- the one good thing on the food menu. I usually take out of town visitors here because it's worth seeing, and the beer list is decent, but do not go for the food."}
{"text":"So far it's very crowded and not much seating for people waiting. My first thought is that the hostess was pretty rude and self-righteous. However, it did get much better. The food was delicious and the wait staff was friendly. The only complaint was that it was very crowded like We were on top of the party in the table next to us. And the food did take a pretty long time to get there. Overall the food and beer was great and it was a very cool atmosphere and once in a lifetime experience dinning in a converted church."}
{"text":"When visiting Pittsburgh with my boyfriend, our plan was to walk everywhere, but after hearing about this place, we were curious enough call a cab and head out there.  And it was totally worth it.    For a business that is founded on an incredibly sacrilegious setup--a brewery in a church--the entire concept is carried out rather tastefully.  The church is highly preserved and still very beautiful.  Yes, you might be sitting on a pew while drinking your beer, but the waitresses aren't walking around in nuns' habits or anything cheesy like that.    They offer a beer sampler that includes all their regular brews and seasonal taps.  There was a nice variety of dark to light beers.  None of them were out-of-this-world amazing, but all of them were quite good.    Only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is the location.  You feel a bit out in the middle of nowhere, which isn't always ideal for a night of drinking.  However, I'd highly recommend this place otherwise."}
{"text":"I usually hate \"I wish i liked this place\" reviews, but CBW is an exception. A great concept and set up, but three main aspects fall short: beer, food, and service. This place is the opposite of don't judge a book by the cover. More like dont judge a cover by the book"}
{"text":"food was OK and the service was fine. the ugliest cherubs ever on the walls (i know that, that is totally irrelevant but, once we noticed them we couldn't stop laughing). any way it's a nice place."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the beer. Great place to meet up with friends and have some good beer and food!"}
{"text":"Wow this was an amazing location.  The soaring ceilings and brew equipment on the alter were fantastic.  I was in town with some buddies and they told me I would be impressed by the layout here, and I was.  We sat in the bar (which still took a few minutes to get a seat in) and had beer and a pizza.  First off the pizza.  We had the southwestern, I think, and it was really good.  It had a great balance of sweetness and spice and was loaded with tasty veggies.  Now what we really came here for was the beer.  I went ahead and got a flight of 5 oz of all 8 of their offerings.  The three house beers were good, especially the dunkel, but nothing to go crazy about.  The IPA they had going was very good.  The other 4 beers they had were kind of different.  I can't say they were bad, but not something I could handle a lot of.  The had a Mole Stout that was pretty spicy on the lips, two spiced Christmas beers and barleywine.  All 4 packed a lot of flavor, and had their merits in smalls doses, but you'd have to really like them to have a full pint of any of those.  All around a great location with good food and lots of interesting and good beer."}
{"text":"Gastropub 101 (GP101) - A term I've coined to cover the vast amount of restaurants opening up these days from coast to coast. You know the ones, a hand full of appetizers usually including wings as the main offering, overpriced burgers and sandwiches that you can make much better at home, and dinner offerings that proclaim over the top creativity and deliver forgettable plates of protein and starch with some bagged \"fresh\" vegetable of the day.  Another feature of this new breed of dining experiences is that they look and feel like they're either a chain or want to be a chain imitating the business models of the Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, TGI Fridays etc. without taking the time to develop an actual good service and food plan upfront. I subscribe to the begin with the end in mind philosophy but you have to create a good product and reputation before you go big. And don't worry, I don't consider the examples stellar places to go but I do frequent them from time to to time because of their slightly elevated level of \"didn't suck\". My best experiences are and have always been the mom and pop's places that now join the ranks of the minority in any food scene theses days. Seek them out, give them credit where credit is due, and keep them alive through your patronage.  As a consumer and Yelper I try to give an honest opinion of my experience so you the potential customer can have enough information to go or not to any particular establishment. So now you know what I mean by GP101 you'll understand upfront that while there may be some variation in the place that is noteworthy the restaurant itself didn't suck, wasn't great, and was forgettable in the end.  I attempt to rate by service, ambiance, and quality of food with a clear understanding that the industry's operational tempo can change from day to day depending on a dynamic set of variables we call the human condition, todays great service might be tomorrows bad service just like all of us have off days so do restaurants. You can bet your bottom dollar that if I start off with the place sucked then it really sucked as I'm usually a kind yelper and look for the good over the bad.  Church Brew works: Service - inconsistent but pleasant Ambiance - Unique and interesting (Only reason for the 3rd star) Food - Forgettable but the beer is good"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!! Had a buffalo burger...A little dry, prolly cause it's buffalo.... Maybe mix in something with a little fat to give it some much needed juiciness... Still overall a great time!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  Church Brew Works has been on my list for months and we had some friends come to town so it was a perfect time to go.  The building is neat.  It is an old church and when you walk in the building has many of the old church features.  We ordered some beer which were really good.  (I would give the beer a four star!). The place was packed so service was really slow.  We got some fries to snack on while we waited for pizzas and sandwiches for 40 minutes.  My husbands chicken sausage sandwich was not good.  The pizzas are really big, with a thick bread-y crust.  I got the 5 cheese pizza.  It needed something.  Nothing special about the pizza. My friends got a chicken pizza which they said was fine.   I would definitely say this place is more a mediocre restaurant than a pub.  I'm glad I went to see what it was all about but won't be going back.  I liked fatheads on the south side much better!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by this place from the start, a church converted into a brewery, what a concept! It's definitely a cool space, worth visiting if you're a local or visitor. Now on to the beer, many of them were very good and many were not. Beer is certainly all about personal preference so I won't cloud your head with my judgement. I do suggest that you try the sampler because you get to try around 8-10 beers and then focus on your favorites after that. The Food...certainly not the area where they shine in my opinion. I tried a few bites of pizza and while it was spicy (which is nice), it was mushy and just pretty bad overall. I had the Pierogi Sauté for my meal and I enjoyed the pierogies but the sauce and other added elements missed the mark a bit and didn't really add anything to the dish. Definitely a spot worth checking out because it's  a cool space, but maybe eat before you go and just plan to sample the beer."}
{"text":"The glass of ParaWeise and Bazaar Berliner were some of the best beers I've ever had- so summery and nuanced! I was surprised and delighted to find the pizza comparable to New Haven's best, honeyed and garlicky with a great crust, and the nontraditional pierogies were outstanding. What a welcome to Pittsburgh! Voted some of the best on my website, Foodette Reviews."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, we liked the pizza. Unfortunately on our return tonight we Were disappointed to find out that the pizza oven was no longer there.  We tried a beer flight...I wasn't too into the flavors, kind of harsh to put down. I had a buffalo chicken tender Pittsburgh salad..which was basic overall. If it wasn't for the tiramisu we ordered, I wouldn't of been impressed with our visit. The \"brewmisu\" was very good..we are on the hunt for the best tiramisu in the burgh.  This one is up there with Lidias."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is an amazing brewery situated in a former church that has great pizza, great food, and  great beer."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great food. Can be a little packed on weekends, but the wait is always worthwhile. Small outdoor seating area for the summer months is very quaint!"}
{"text":"The building is beautiful. A brewery in an old church. The beer was good, and the service was great. Our bartender was personable and quick. There was a strong odor from the brewing process"}
{"text":"Just for the chance to have your meal in an old church this place deserves 4 stars. Yes the food is decent too - ranging from 3-4 stars. I have to say with this though that we shared appetizers only. All in all a fun place to try out for sure. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"i have to say, this must've been the most interesting renovation project when it was conceived.  i would've loved to have that as a design challenge.    our experience was low key as we were here rather early (6pm-ish) before the crowds.  we were seated in one of the \"pews\" in the nave with a central view of the apse, whose altar worships brew kettles.  along the left side of the aisle is the bar area, and i think the transcept areas had additional seating.    the beer was really affordable...had to be the lame-ass pittsburgh tourist and order traditional pierogies, which at first sight and bite seemed heavy and tasteless but actually grew on me.  the hummus dish was a bit much with the bread a bit over baked.  the food was excellent, and i would definitely go back with friends if i lived there.  faster service and exceptional food would've brought it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"For a place that is so beautiful in appearance, I really wish they had the service to match how it looks!  We order from here for work once a month or so, and on occasion, friends have had birthday get togethers and dinners there, so I have gotten to experience the Church Brew Works many many times.  This most recent time, it was a debacle to order a takeout order... and when it finally did get taken and we picked it up, much of it was wrong... it was basic stuff that was completely wrong which made it worse.    Consistency is important, and I feel like as of late, there is none here.  I also feel like some of the quality has gone to the wayside.  Hopefully they will step it up and become the place that they once were!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time this past week while visiting Pittsburgh. What an amazing idea-a brewery/restaurant to a huge old church. The place is so big, just viewing is an experience. The beer and food are very good. My family had a really nice lunch and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place with friends during a bachelor party and was thoroughly impressed. The vibe of the place is awesome (would love to come back for brunch), beer was great, and food was fantastic; at least the late night limited menu we saw.   Highlight = Pierogi Pizza. SOOOOOOOOO good. We got one. And then got two more to go. Cheese, mashed potatoes, onions.... It shouldn't work on a pizza, but it totally does."}
{"text":"Kinda like if a BJ's Restaurant/Brewhouse got their hands on an old church. Food and their beers are on par with that sort of chain. Servers are great."}
{"text":"Had a flight of beer. It was well explained and great. Cool experience and everyone should go here while visiting.   Also they have these amazing potato cakes. It's a must visit."}
{"text":"Probably better off skipping this place next time I visit but had to see the place bc a huge church turned brewery is a really cool concept.  A few of the beers here are ok.  The bartender initially was sort of a douche.  Either he confuses rudeness with having a personality or he was nearing the end of his shift and just DGF and it fails to reflect well on the establishment.  The girl that took over for him 20 minutes later was much more personable.  A couple of tasty beers here but fewer than other breweries in this town.    What is really absurd is that the bar-keeps I talked to completely agree that the beers suck, but the place opts to serve the shit rather than dump it and just brew something better.    Tried a beer sampler.  Four regular beers and four seasonals.  I liked the Celestial gold, and the Pipe Organ Pale Ale  The thunderstyle(i think that was the name?) IPA, some licorice mint concoction (sucked), the early summer brew \"confessional kolsch\" (again, i think that was the name) were not my cup of tea.    Behind the bar was a mess.  Wet floors, a clusterfuck of tangled hoses, multiple Dish/glass racks stacks all over the place, wet floors, dusty display of glasses....just a general unsanitary/under-managed feel. That made me & my bro think things like the kitchen....which we cannot see....would only be worse off.  Eff-it, we wound up ordering a little food. Very little food.  Spinach-feta-gouda dip. That was pretty ok."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazingly beautiful use of an old church. Beer is delicious and varied. My dinner was off-the-hook yummy. Great wait staff, great service! I love Pittsburgh and I'm glad this restaurant and brewery is here!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is better than the food or beer and it is QUITE expensive. Seriously though, it is almost breathtaking when you walk in the door. A huge church renovated into a brewery/restaurant...what a sight! The altar is very impressive, full of giant beer tanks. The stained glass is beautiful and they even have a few of the confessional rooms used as storage behind the bar! Definitely worth stopping in for a drink, but there are much better places to get food.  We had the cheesy spinach dip as an appetizer and that was pretty good, although a small serving. I was very excited for the brisket...which turned out to be under-cooked and very rubbery. I didn't even eat half of it. I was able to sample some platters that others with me ordered. I was impressed with the Buffalo Meatloaf. The Pierogie entree was very good but was almost $20!   The best part of our dinner was our server, Ally. She was pleasant, energetic and patient with our indecisive party of 8. She was very knowledgeable about the different types of beers and made great suggestions for our table.  As far as the beer goes, Thunderhop and Unholy Matrimony are pretty good...Not sure if they have a happy hour, but if they do, that would be a great time to sample their beers, take in the sights and then head somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Was able to snag a table for 8 in the opening seating section (left side) on a Friday night after hearing there was a 1.5 hour wait for a table in the reservation section (right side).    Since this was our first visit, we ordered the beer flight, which came with a healthy portion of 8 samplers, and I had my usual White Russian.  For dinner, I ordered the gluten free version of the Veggie Spaghetti, which came with sautéed mushrooms on top instead of the fried mushroom meatballs and was deemed very tasty even by my meat-and-potatoes-loving significant other despite the dish's ghastly healthified name.  I asked for a side of steamed broccoli, which the server offered to order on top of the Veggie Spaghetti dish as part of the gluten free substitution to avoid an additional charge.  My SO had the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and fries.  The saucy and tender pork was delicious with the creamy coleslaw.  We loved the raucous atmosphere of the restaurant, and my German other half waxed poetic about the lederhosen-donning live polka band.  He said that this was exactly the type of restaurant you were likely to stumble into in Germany.  And even though the beer wasn't our favorite that we've had, we were impressed by the obvious quality of their process and the presentation.  The food is definitely several rungs above traditional bar food, both in taste and in plating.  Our friends' dishes looked tasty as well, the Buffalo Meatloaf in particular, which came piled on a bed of mashed potatoes and made us both a tad jealous.  I know what we'll have to try on our next visit."}
{"text":"This is an old (and large) Catholic church turned brew pub in the late 90s.  Often noisy and crowded, but still a good standby if more upscale places don't suit your fancy.  The menu is solid American staples plus hand-crafted pizza and in-house beers.  The beers run a little too hoppy for my tastes, but they're still enjoyable.  They used to sell nice logo-bearing frisbees here, early 80's Wham-o grade, \"near professional\" models, quite nice.  Not sure if they still do."}
{"text":"We've come here sporadically over the years as you really can't beat the atmosphere.  The food prices have increased significantly over the years, so the quality to value proposition might be a bit askew.  I had the buffalo chicken pirogue dish and it was very spicy.   Large serving and tasty, impossible to finish. The Kobe beef cheesesteak was good, but honestly, there have been far better ones for far less.  The meat and cheese board was good, but pricy at $16.95.  The beers were both good...Irish ale and a jalapeño/chocolate infused porter.  All in all, it's good, not great and a bit overpriced.  Some guest taps to add more beer variety would serve them well.  I'll add the obligatory alter photo."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch this past weekend. This is the best church on the planet. I enjoyed the Pittsburgh-y cuisine and beverages amidst an altar of beer.   We wanted to try as many of the beers as possible, so we opted for the 8-flight beer sampler. There were a wide variety of brews in the flights. Some seemed a little off, but we generally liked most of them... I think I liked maybe 6 of the 8 samples.  Opinions on the food were mixed. The traditionally-prepared pierogies were tasty enough, but drenched in too much butter. The sweet potato fries were good, not great, and came with a spicy chipotle ketchup. My friend ordered the Cajun risotto fritters - I just had one bite, but I thought they were delicious. Others ordered pierogie pizza and didn't love it; I think they were expecting pierogies on top of the pizza, but as it turned out, the whole pizza was like a giant pierogie.   The service didn't bother me, but I think some in our party were displeased. The kitchen screwed up a few things, and the food runner was pretty unhelpful (didn't mention that plates were really hot, claimed she \"just brings out the food\" when we had an issue, etc.).  But whatever. It's a brewery in a church. Thou shall not make minor complaints."}
{"text":"The guy who hosted us knew about all the great places in Pittsburgh.  He took us here for lunch, and I could not have been happier!  The food was AMAZING!  I did not have any beer, so I can't comment on that.  The building is just beautiful.  Service was not anything to brag about, but everything else made up for it.  I had the potato pierogies with alfredo sauce - perfect choice, like big ravioli.  :)  I hope I'm able to find some place that serves perogies here in Columbus, Georgia.  I would really love to visit Pittsburgh again one day.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place.  Oh god, this place.  I went here expecting great things, but alas, I was disappointed on all accounts.    My date and I had the brew steamed mussels to start, and they tasted sour.  I LOVE mussels, and these were some of the worst.  This was the highlight of our meal.  We then went on to split the shinkasa cheesesteak, and the pulled pork sandwiches.  The steak sandwich was a desert in my mouth, with very little onions and peppers, and no sauce offered.  The pulled pork was ok...but once again, topped with almost no slaw, and very, very skimpy on the sauce.  The final nail in the coffin was the fries.  They were so cold, I couldn't even touch them.  The ambiance is even worse!  Just a dull, loud hum for the entirety of your meal, in a space that seems like they're just jamming you in wherever they can fit you.  I asked if they could turn on some music, and I was told there was music playing.  Whats the points?!  Service was friendly, but inattentive.  This was probably the only thing I could say was decent about the meal, because even though she didn't really check on us very often, she seemed busy, so it's understandable.  But yeah, I won't be returning to Church Brew Works."}
{"text":"I found the church-like ambiance, with the original pews and stained glass windows, quite fascinating. This wonderful building is now an active brewery, with much more than pub food. The service, I must admit, was just okay."}
{"text":"Ben Frankin was misquoted as saying something along the lines of \"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy...\" Well, it turns out he was talking about rain, and it's effect on grapes, and how wine is proof that we are loved... but that is all beside the point.  Three things I am \"In to\"-- Ben Franklin, beer, and churches.  I loved the atmosphere here, and would take the time soak it all in again if I had the chance. The whole theme really had me at hello. I've seen the whole revival of an old church space into something of a place of drunken debauchery done before, it's pretty popular in trendy European neighborhoods, but the Church Brew Works has toned it down a notch to make it accessible and enjoyable without being cheesy. I think Ben Franklin would have approved.  The brew selections were nice, and along with what I sampled, I thought I got a fair deal for what I paid.   The thing that made this a three star was (and I hate to say it) was the service. Our bartender had an easy job. We were two thirsty people on a Thursday late afternoon, but still, she seemed unenthused at helping us quench our thirst. We made it work, but without even cracking so much as a smile, or offering any suggestions or sharing any history of the place, she slid our drinks across the counter only after we flagged her down. I am hoping that she's had better days before and since.  My conclusion is, I'll be back. Next time for food, and anticipating some better service."}
{"text":"Surprisingly last night was my first visit to church brew even though we have lived in the city for about 4 years. We finally had a night to go out and do something so I thought it would be nice to go eat somewhere different.   The beer here was very nice. I ordered the Celestial Gold. I'm not a huge fan of dark beer so I thought this would be a great option and i really enjoyed it! Bobby ordered the Polaris Patersbier which is explained in their menu blonde belgian beer with minty/hop aromas and a herbal/pine finish with a little bitterness.. woah that explained it perfectly. How do they do that? I stuck with the same beer and next he tried Pious Monk Dunkel . It wasn't his favorite so he ended with the patersbier :) i noticed a few people ordering the beer sampler (as well as pictures of it on yelp) I did not see this advertised in the menu and totally forgot about it. Maybe next time :( (Where was this located in their beer menu?!)  For appetizer, we ordered the traditional perogies. The onions were perfect! I could have had them as a side dish.   For dinner, I ordered the southwest chicken wrap and upgraded to sweet potato fries.  To be honest, the fries were not hot at all which was a real bummer because i LOVE sweet potato fries. Everywhere i've went, the restaurant served the fries with a honey cinnamon dip. CBW served with a chipotle ketchup. Dont get me wrong, it was a nice twist on ketchup, but it did not go with sweet potato fries at all. Seriously. Who thought sweet potato fries and spicy ketchup went together?   Bobby ordered the shrimp & grits.... DELICIOUS. I was skeptic because It seems like a light brunch affair, not dinner but it was very filling and was made perfectly.   For dessert, we ordered the frozen peanut butter mouse cake. It was okay.. nothing too special.  I found service to be average. The GM was walking around so happy and peppy asking tables about their meal. Also, when walking to the restroom all of the other servers seemed happy and great with their tables. Our server Ashley put no enthusiasm into the night and kind of seemed annoyed when we asked about the different beers. Also, our dirty appetizer plate sat on our table the entire meal even though i put it right on the end and Ashley stopped at our table a few times. It was a little awkward especially because i used to serve and a big tip is to clear the table when you see dirty plates. Whatever..   Service, my crappy sweet potato fries & the mediocre dessert are stopping me from the 4 star review.  We enjoyed the beer though and atmosphere.  im sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"The beer is just ok.  Service at the bar was slow.  We had friends in from Berlin Germany and it took us 30 min to get seated.  Seems as if they don't have many servers and on a Friday night, well that's a fail.  After we were seated we were ignored for a minimum of 20 minutes.  After watching other people get seated around us and their drink orders taken we got up and left.  I told the manager about how bad the service sucked, which in case you didn't know is a reflection on you.  He offered us appetizers and something else but kinda seemed annoyed because of our complaints.  I don't want your charity I just want served.  I would never return here for mediocre beers and crap service ever again.  Also if I owned this joint I would fire your manager that was working on 11/25/16 around 4 pm."}
{"text":"It's a novelty place for sure. Beer is good, food is decent. We went on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch and service was fair. The place is beautiful with all the stained glass windows...great atmosphere. We got some appetizers but the pizza also looked good. I wish they had more of a store but maybe that will come?"}
{"text":"This was always a \"must see\" when I had visitors in town.  I never loved the food, but the atmosphere is what makes it.  Oh... and the beer.  So this was a must stop for a night cap with co-workers while back in town for work.  I love all the ales - the amber I had last night was very hoppy with a good bite.   Being catholic, I always kind of feel a little sinful here, which is very thrilling!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was not too busy when we stopped by, so we did not have to wait long to be seated. The waitress could have been a bit more attentive to us so that we did not have to wait throughout the service. I ordered the pierogie pizza. We thought that the food tasted mediocre. I fell for the publicity that the restaurant gets for being inside a former church. We will not return."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. We don't have anything like this in Southern California. Good breweries, yes, but no converted old church breweries! Hahaha. Came during Oktoberfest time and loved their Oktoberfest beer. Even my gf who's not a big beer drinker, loved it too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The beer and food are always good. The service is good, and the setting (a former church) is extraordinarily unique."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!  We stop here every time we visit friends.  Awesome building with awesome food and beer.  I usually get the Steak salad.  I haven't found one any where else that comes close yet.  It may be the fries on top or the best ranch dressing around.  It could be the beer too!  The Pilsner is great.  Wish they had an amber but I'm not complaining.  We have also had the pizza which ask anyone...I am not a big pizza person, but it was very very good.  Brick oven pizza that is hot and delicious.  Hoping we get to sit outside this time.  Large private area with a hop garden.  Really cool place to stop and grab lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere--my family and I sat up at the altar and it was a great area to sit. They had an awesome selection of beer and I enjoyed mine, even though I'm not a beer connoisseur, my uncle who is was very impressed by the selection. I don't eat bread or pasta, so that kind of narrowed down the menu for me. I ordered paella and really enjoyed it. It was a tiny bit too salty for my taste, but I really enjoyed it other than that.  The atmosphere was so awesome. I can't wait to go here!"}
{"text":"They brew their own beers here!  CBW is a microbrewery and restaurant inside the architecturally beautiful (think stained glass windows and high ceilings) St. John the Baptist (former) Church.    I'm not sure if we stopped by around Happy Hour or not, but our plates of pierogis, mushroom/lentil fritters, and beers were $3-$5 each!  Taylor, our waiter, was very sweet and recommended their pumpkin ice cream, which we could not pass up on.  CBW is such a unique experience and the only pub located inside a historic church!  I'm definitely stopping by here the next time I'm in Pitt!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring out of towners for a unique experience. The beer is good, the food is slightly above average and a little overpriced, but the main reason you come here is for the ambiance. Very beautiful building and an awesome setting for a brewery. Definitely worth stopping in once or twice a year."}
{"text":"The setting is truly breath taking. And by breath taking I was feeling unsure if I should drink or not. It felt bad but yet so good too! The food was okay. The beers were great, so many choices! They will let you sample before you decide to commit! I would go for happy hour and probably only order appetizers, I wasn't impressed with the food otherwise.   It's such a cool atmosphere even though it's somewhat strange to be in a church drinking."}
{"text":"Although it's been awhile since I've been here, I've visited a few times on various occasions in the past.  Needless to say, the atmosphere is definitely the most unique aspect of this place.  As others have mentioned, the place is a decommissioned Catholic church.  The seats are pews, and the brewing apparatus is located where the altar used to be.  For this reason alone, it's probably the most unique place in PGH to grab a drink.  Having said that, I've generally been underwhelmed by the quality of the food here.  Although I can't recall details because it's been awhile, it just hasn't wowed me, whereas I would expect it to be gastropub-quality, given the atmosphere and the price point.  Fortunately, every time I've gone, someone else has picked up the tab.  As for the drinks, you're pretty limited if you're not a beer drinker, like me.  They do have a few wines to choose from, but again, I haven't been blown away by any of them. At a microbrewery such as this, I understand that beer is the star of the show, and I expect to be limited in my drinking options, but I would at least hope that the munchies would be good.  Given the popularity of this place with out-of-towners due to its novelty, I'm sure I'll be back at some point, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, based on my experience."}
{"text":"Hit this place up on a weekend trip to PA. First off, let me explain that up until 1996, this place was a church and a beautiful one at that. Even though they brew their own been on the former alter, store their liquor in the old confessionals, and make their pizza pies where the old organ used to play, they kept all the stained glass, high ceilings, and rose window from this place. While I did feel somewhat sinful eating and drinking there, my experience here was excellent.   We had been drinking all day, so that did not stop there. Nice mix of homemade beers from pilsner to stout. GF ordered a french onion soup that was delicious. Table ordered a white pizza with chicken and spinach which was decent. Customer service was excellent here. I joked with the server that for working at a place like this, her penance would be that she had to carry around the extra heavy menus. She agreed on commented how it was tough with 10 toppers. The mgr, Phil, saw I was wearing a Chicago Bears shirt and start making fun of it with another employee. Of course, I started jawing back and forth with him. He came over to the table and was very friendly. He comped a round of drinks and I asked him where I could buy some of their pint glasses (see photo, glass says on the 8th day man created beer). He came back with 4 glasses for our table on the house. Saved me the trouble of having to steal them. haha.   If you can get past the place that this place used to be a church, you are in for a treat at this place. I would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"This place was so cool!  I didn't even realize it existed and we actually only randomly stumbled upon it on our way from Lawrenceville into the city.  I'm so glad we found it!  The bartender was so nice and friendly, the atmosphere was super cool, and it's so big and spacious inside!  I can't wait to go back!  We got a couple of appetizers which were really tasty (get the pierogis!) and I like that they have a full bar since I'm not a huge beer drinker.  I would highly recommend checking this place out, it's worth seeing!"}
{"text":"If the prices weren't so high, I would have given this restaurant more stars.  The environment is beautiful.  Much like in churches of the time, you aren't sure where to look because there are so many beautiful features.  The menu is extremely unique with everything from run of the mill pastas to pizzas to alligator pierogies.  And the food we tried was great.  But the prices are quite high for the food you get, especially considering they are double most other brew pub restaurants in the area.  I ordered the pierogi pizza at the recommendation of several Yelpers.  I can see why it was pricey - it was HUGE.  I wish they had size options for the pizzas as this pizza could have easily served three people.  It is a good thing I loved the pizza as I'll be eating it for the next three meals.  My husband had the pasta in peanut sauce and thought it was very tasty.  Again, the portion was HUGE.    We had both ordered appetizers and would not have if we had known the food portions were so large.    The french onion soup was fantastic but the wings were nothing to write home about.  I ordered the peanut sauce version and expected them to be tossed in the sauce.  Instead, I had plain wings with a side of the sauce delivered.  I did dip them, but tossing the wings adds to the flavor because some of it soaks in.  I'm not sure if all of their wings are served this way or just the peanut sauce ones, but it seemed strange.  We were originally hoping to try some dessert, but with the giant portions, we had no room left.  In all, an enjoyable experience with good beer, food and service, but a little to pricey to be more highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am a fan though the smell is something to be aware of. I went for lunch and the food is fantastic. I did sample a couple of beers and they were very tasty. We got great service as well. I would not do another lunch for fear that smell may linger on me long after I leave. I recommend trying this place when you are interested in a good night with your friends.  I would not take my wife (read girlfriend for you single folk) here although she may want a pizza or burger brought home..."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! Their seven onions French onion soup is my favorite! I crave for it always, no matter where I've ordered the soup no one else can compare! The also offer brick oven pizza which is splendid!"}
{"text":"Funny little place, this restaurant. I can save you most of the review about the fact it's an old church converted in to a restaurant - other reviewers have covered in depth. Novelty aside, some of the dishes are misses, but most of the items we chose were spot on.  ATMOSPHERE: (Psst... it's a church :). You'll get just what you expect for decor - an abandoned church, the altar \"desecrated\" by a massive hopper and other brewery equipment. The church aisle is largely untouched, while the sides are made into a dining area (using old pews for the booth sections. While most of the church components are largely in tact, I felt myself dissapointed that they didn't do MORE with the church theme - the organ was broken, for example, the menu's could have been like hymnals, the plates to look like offering dishes, the dishes named after hymns or had some reference to church / holy ingredients / so on. That said, you absolutely still get the picture of eating in church, to the point serious church goers might be offended (we weren't).  FOOD: There are some gems on this menu, and some unimaginative stinkers. Luckily, we listened to others and stuck to the bar menu, although many of the \"premium\" dishes looked very good walking by (very small, but still appetizing). We had:  1 - Spinach, Feta & Smoked Gouda Dip - It was \"fine\" tasting, but I expected a revelation (pun intended), and what we got was a spinach-artichoke dip in disguise that you can get at any chain restaurant anywhere. Our first impression was a dull one with this... they need to amp up the feta / gouda aspect, or do something more to make this dish stand out from others.  2 - Traditional Cheese Pizza - REALLY good... some genius brought a wood fired pizza oven into the church (come on - there's a marketing concept about flames here they missed...). The sauce was flavorful, the cheese-to-dough-to sauce ratio heavenly, and the crust was perfect thanks to the wood-firing. I dreamt about this pizza days after we left... good thing for me we live in Illinois or I'd be a heifer!  3 - Cinco Fromaggio Pizza - Good. The menu didn't say anything about sauce, so I guess I expected the traditional red. This pizza comes instead with a green basil-pesto sauce which, for us, was much too sparse and didn't have enough of a punch of flavor. This left the pizza quite dry (especially with the feta and powdered parmesan cheeses), and while we enjoyed the cheese combo, found ourselves sneaking the kid's cheese pizza instead the moment they were full. Considering the Cinco is a \"premium\" pizza, it's a shame that standard cheese kicked its butt.  4 - Church Works Brew beer flight - Must try, do not miss it (you simply cannot go to a craft brewery and NOT sample the wares... it would be a sin!). Plenty of drink, enough variety to keep you interested, and the different flavors / styles are worth it!  SERVICE: The table service was great. Our waitress was a sweetheart, and catered to our children in a way few servers do (taking their order instead of ours, talking to THEM about what they were doing in town, where THEY were from, etc.).  She made menu suggestions, brought drinks quickly, refills for kids and adults as soon as we were empty (The result was a very enjoyable evening for them - happy kids = very happy parents = great tip.  Side note - the bartender's service was less than friendly. There is a SMALL gift shop behind one corner of the bar where you can get t-shirts, 6 packs of the beer, etc.... while I appreciate the need to serve customers sitting at the bar, and there were several, I took GREAT offense to him telling me that they were more important... I believe his exact words were \"one minute --- gotta take care of the paying customers first\"... Listen bub - when someone walks up and drops more than $100 on the \"gift shop\", screw the guy on the stool and his $4 beer. (holy crap, you say? We bought a number of mini-kegger beers to serve the party of 14 at our final destination-week in VA Beach). Bottom line, our last impression was this  bartender and his poor attitude, and he should be ashamed of himself.  VALUE: All jokes aside, if you want good value you're going to have to be smart about the menu. We ordered from the bar menu only - as other reviewers warned, the dinner menu was very high pricing with very small portions. What we paid for what we got was worth it and then some... if we'd have ordered the dinner entrees, I suspect I'd feel differently.  If you are anywhere in the general vicinity of this place, stop by and check it out - you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The food was awful. The beer was ok. The setting was awkward. I got a \"chapple\" and it was dry and almost unedible. The house beer is all pretty ok, but the church setting was very strange. The waitress was nice but kind of dull. I probably won't come unless drugged."}
{"text":"So sad the pizza and the old menu is gone.  I really liked the pizza here and now the menu is long, fancy with lots and lots of greasy food.  Tho, last time I was there, I had a good salad tho with pretty much no dressing."}
{"text":"What a cool place! We were totally taken in by the gimmick of the brewery in a church. It's a gorgeous place and much more relaxing to visit for beer instead of prayer. We split a tasting flight and the beer was quite good. We also had a hummus plate which was not great, but hey, you win some you lose some. Overall, pretty sure God is smiling down on this place."}
{"text":"An old Roman Catholic church turned into a brew pub/restaurant? Yes, please!  I love it!  The huge stained glass windows, pipe organ, beer!  It's pretty awesome to look at, and it has great food and beer.  Ok beer first.  I did the Celestial Gold.  It's a pilsner beer, that tastes like a lighter version of Magic Hat's #9.  So, yeah, pretty darn good!  For a starter I had the Cajun Risotto Fritters, chorizo, peppers, onions and cheese fried with a spicy sauce.  They were very good.  For my entree I had the Shinkasa Cheesesteak .  It was Kobe beef with peppers (no onions for me) and provolone.  The sandwich was perfect.  Delicious and not greasy.  Overall it was a great experience.  I will return next time I go to Pitt."}
{"text":"This Place is awesome! They have Great beer and amazing food!  A must go to place in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Food is fine - venue is awesome, but I HATE the fact that they aren't supporting paid sick days. WTF is that?"}
{"text":"Beer in a church? Sure! This sweet place is a beast for pizza, suds and a great atmosphere.  The pierogi pizza is something to take advantage of, as are any one of the craft beers.   Service tends to be slower during peak times, so it's probably best to just get a pitcher to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"I get it, they have a really cool concept and it's a great tourist-y spot, but I have never really enjoyed a meal there.   The inside of the church is beautiful but the ambience feels weird to me. They don't play music (at least not while I've been there) and it really throws me off because I feel like I can hear everyone and everyone can hear me because of the acoustics of the building. Also, I just think some background music is crucial while you're out to eat--it sets the mood!   The service here is decent but it almost feels like a chain restaurant rather than a funky, local brewery. Last time I was there my server didn't know much about the beers, which I thought was weird. They do have good pizzas and the beer selection is good but I think everything is over-priced (probably due to the tourist-y factor.)   I've taken people from out of town there twice, hoping to show them a good time at a fun local spot but was disappointed each time and wished I had gone somewhere else. It's not awful, but definitely doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion."}
{"text":"By some twist of fate, my Uber driver en-route here happened to be openly religious -- of the \"witness to all potential non-believers\" camp. He didn't seem pleased by my destination all too much. And I'll admit -- it did feel kind of sacrilegious to imbibe in an old church, but also kind of neat...and certainly abnormal.  I'd say come here more for the photo ops and atmosphere itself rather than beer quality. It seems like a cool place to hang out. I met an old friend for happy hour and it served as an ideal, chill location to spend some time catching up. Happy hour specials = half-off prices. Our server recommended ordering drafts over tasters or a flight. I chose their mango wheat beer, which was...what you'd expect from a wheat beer. I didn't order any food.  I think it was a nice place to experience once, especially as a first-time visitor to Pittsburgh, but I'd give future priority to other breweries."}
{"text":"A disappointing and Dog-Unfriendly place  After a 400 mile dog friendly trip, I was greatly disappointed to come to downtown Pittsburgh for my second visit to the Church Brew Works.  As a lover of beer, this place was a treat on my past visit.  This trip was different, as this time I was traveling with my four legged companion, a 10 year old and gentle cattle dog.  I was excited to see in an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,   \"No doggie bag needed\" the below was quoted by the owner of the Church Brew Works \"Hey, do we ever have dogs on the patio?\" Sean Casey, proprietor of the Church Brew Works, called out to a staffer when contacted by phone. Turns out they have, for the past two years.  Driving up on the overcrowded facility, I could tell it had changed from the last time I was there when it was a quaint and nearly vacant place to enjoy a beer.  I went in while my girlfriend and pooch waited outside. I kindly asked if the \"rumor that the beer garden was pet friendly\" was true and quicker than a dog, the wait staff barked back \"NO IT IS NOT\"  I get it, a policy change, but for someone that had planned a long road trip with this place being the highlight, a barking waitress was not appreciated.   Many dog-friendly websites list the Church Brew Works as being pet friendly, and the internet makes it hard to control fact from fiction, but here in a print newspaper, the place is listed as pet friendly.  If you change your mind... That's your choice, but train your staff to offer pet friendly alternatives... Heck, take it a few steps further, first Google your place and \"pet friendly\" and work on changing the report to \"no pets allowed\" 2nd Why not be proactive and put \"sorry no pets\" and 3rd why not do something really customer service friendly... How about find other proprietors that are pet friendly, print them out and hand them to potential guests instead of slamming the door on them and sending them away... Doing these things keeps customers instead of alienating them.  I have to give props to someone who got it right ... Atria's Restaurant by PNC Park.   They welcomed poochie in, gave her a huge bowl of water, and catered to us as we set outside and enjoyed beer.  They were not even listed as \"pet friendly\" That is why they got my vote and a great tip, and Church Brew Works... Well I think Iron City could do a better job at making beer then you... At least their beer is Union Made with love instead of served by cocky short tempered door guards for wait-staff!"}
{"text":"This is an old church that has been made into a brewery. The inside is spacious and well decorated with stained glass windows. It's set up with a bar and high top tables on the left and dinner tables on the right. There's also outdoor seating. They have parking in the back but it gets filled quickly.  They have about 8-10 beers on draft. My favorite is the celestial ale. It's light and crisp, and great for people that don't really like beer. They do flights as well but every time I go they are missing a few.   Food is just ok. Nothing extraordinary. They do make homemade chips, when fried right they're delicious, but sometimes they are stale."}
{"text":"Was totally pumped to be here and the look of the church didn't disappoint. Although it seems a little tired. Like they need to inject some energy into it because it could be awesome.  Staff also was tired or lacked energy you could tell. All pleasant, but kinda like they had been up too late the night before.  Bar area is crowded with tables. I would try picnic table approach, maybe simplify the menu with a few items you could rock, and bring in the millineals!  We had two pasta dishes and an appetizer. Not bad, not great. Also the beer was fair in my opinion. There was a coconut porter I think that was good. Didn't make it to the IPA because we were bored and it was a slow Monday night. Love my beer and have had more varieties than I care to mention on here. Probably not good enough to go back too unless I was a first time tourist.  Beer glasses were cool though!"}
{"text":"Long wait, good food, good beer. Nice atmosphere, bit over priced.  Service was just okay."}
{"text":"If you're going here for great food and great beer then you're not going to be happy. The food would not be bad if the prices were cut in half but they charge you a premium price for buffalo wild wings quality it's simply not worth it. We had the beer fight with 8 beers and felt that it was actually a good price for what you got but the beer was all pretty bland and left a lot to be desired and they apparently love IPAs as the menu is laden with them. All that being said it's a cool ass place and I'm happy I went but I would not go back a second time. I imagine this is a tourist trap and locals do not go here as its just not very good food or beer."}
{"text":"I don't get the attraction , This place has a cold not so friendly atmosphere. The food was ok , but kinda pricey. didn't look very clean or sanitary considering it was a CHURCH !  I'll just go back to Mario's in the south side."}
{"text":"Just nothing that exciting. I'm not a beer person so this is mainly food related."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works has an interesting ambiance in the setting of an old converted Church.  The beers are quite good - the Celestial Gold is their classic.  Food is slightly overpriced for what it is, but I suppose the cost is in the overhead of such a surreal environment.  It's a good place for happy hour, but doesn't quite meet the mark to be a true dining destination in its own right."}
{"text":"Went here once and had an okay experience. Went again when my sister was visiting and was not impressed at all. My buzzer was broken so we am were sitting around for a while until someone finally came and grabbed us.  We got the nachos as an appetizer and it was mostly dry chips with nothing else. I wanted to say something but since I had a visitor, I decided not to.  For my meal, I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was super fatty and bland. Took forever to get silverware from the waitress too which should be standard?"}
{"text":"This place is very, very cool. The decor and the atmosphere are so unique, the food is delicious and there's beer! What more could you ask for? Oh, that's right, the staff is over the top friendly, too. Would highly recommend to any out of towners... This is a must when visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with a group, but go for the experience, not the food. The beer is pretty awesome usually - I love their Trippel and had a combo IPA/stout the other day that I liked too. Take away their growlers or 750ml are great values.   Traditional pierogies are really yummy, and I get them every time. Also enjoyed the onion soup. Friends had pizzas but they're nothing pretty to look at and I didn't try them. I had the filet mignon because I was feeling extravagant, and for under $30 it might have been a steal. But the medium-rare I ordered was grey throughout (not that I was surprised, Pittsburgh consistently does not know how to make beer to order). Our waiter had absolutely no time for us, or I probably would have asked him to take it back or off the bill. All bitching aside, I enjoy going to this place, will go again, and will tell my friends to go. It's a necessary experience."}
{"text":"I expected the Church Brew Works to be all about the church and the beer.  Much to my surprise, the food was as good as the beer, which was outstanding!    We visited on the Saturday before St. Paddy's Day and got seated before the place started getting crowded.  Service was good and we look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"1. Awesome, awesome concept. Loved how the alter showcased the brewing  2. Variety of award winning beers to choose from - definitely wished we ordered a flight instead. 3. Mussels for that day was absolutely delicious. I couldve easily ordered and finish two more plates. 4. Yinz cheese steak was pretty good, never had one with coleslaw and fries inside but a great compliment to the meat 5. Beer buffalo wings were delicious, not soggy with sauce or too dry. 6. Seats were old school pews"}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once.  I loved it.  I had a spicy artichoke pasta.  It was a vegetarian dish.  I have been meaning to go back, I love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nice varied beer selection of a wide variety of styles, and a really interesting atmosphere since it's in an old church.  I didn't eat so I can only comment on the beer."}
{"text":"Very cool venue 5 star.  We tried 4 of the brew.  The oatmeal stout tasted a bit light, the IPA was good, the Belgian was quite good but no one liked the XMAS brew, good thing we only had a tasting glass for that one.  The 2 women split a salad and were happy (nothing special) and the 2 guys had a barbecue pizza (very tasty). If they don't give you the pizza menu (if you look like tourists) ask for it. Good beer and pizza, stick with that."}
{"text":"First visit to the Church Brew Works and can safely say it left a lot to be desired.  Had the Oktoberfest and the IPA and the schnitzel for dinner.  The beers were average, as was the main course.  The ambiance is phenomenal though."}
{"text":"The Church Brew Works is one of those places where everyone has been and everyone raves about...but I just do not get it. I guess part of the reason I don't really dig it is because I'm more of a cocktail gal than a beer fan. Aside from the fact that it is a brewery and I'm not really a beer drinker, the food is only so-so. I got a perogie dish with chicken and my friend got salmon. Her salmon was ok and the same goes for my perogie dish. We shared some homemade chips with a beer/cheese dip before our meal. The chips were really good, but the same as any place that serves homemade chips, and the beer/cheese dip tasted like chicken broth. It lacked anything special. The atmosphere is awesome, and it would be such a cool place for a classic Pittsburgh rehearsal dinner or similar event...but the food is just ... eh. The atmosphere is the only redeeming quality that I can find.   Also, our waitress was (I can't find a nice way to say this...I'm sorry) kind of annoying. She called us both \"Hun\" and \"Sweetheart\" the ENTIRE evening. It felt like those words are a verbal tic of hers...Every other word was Hun or Sweetheart. Her nails had been painted weeks ago...because there was a horrid spot of nearly gone green nail polish on every nail. It only takes a minute to remove nail polish, and when working in an industry that involves putting your hands in front of people it is worth either repainting them, or leaving them clean. The \"I painted my nails a month ago and haven't gotten around to repainting them or removing the polish\" look is NOT ok. Ok...I'm being mean. I'm sorry...but both my friend and I noticed her nails and her verbal tic, and we were both annoyed by both.   All in all, it's somewhere that all Pittsburghers have to go at least once to see the awesome building, but don't have high expectations...it's just ok."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Visited on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed a few beers that Church Works has to offer and the hot crab dip! Bartender was friendly and extremely knowledgeable. We ordered off the pub menu and grabbed seats at the bar. A neat experience (I had never been) and definitely worth a trip. The altar alone will blow you away!"}
{"text":"Been here many times, a great place to take visitors, as it's built in same style as many churches of the era. Menu is diverse American. I've had pizza, pasta, pierogies, and salads. Today we had sandwiches. My mate had the Italian Beef sandwich and LOVED it, with fries which were average. yes he's had Tooties and likes them too. Our friend had the bison burger, and added sautéed mushrooms. He ordered medium rare, which I believe is tough to accomplish in a smaller leaner burger, the guys didn't agree. We both had sweet potato fries with the spicy ketchup, quite delicious. Nice change of pace. I enjoyed the mushroom cheesesteak! Just as it comes- very tasty. At first arrival, I thought the sandwiches may not be that great due to the bread not being grilled or toasted, but they were just right- soft accompaniment to the perfectly prepared flavorful ingredients. The guys enjoyed the  $3 special on Oktoberfest pints, and I'm a fan of root beer so I tried theirs and it was pretty good! Desserts are also good here, I like the decor/ ambiance of the church pews, my favorite is the ladies room :)"}
{"text":"WHOA. Beer- in a church?   Sign me up.  I think I read one of these reviews and I have to echo the sentiments of it- great idea- poor execution (on the beer.) The food was amazing and the seating was super cool. I wanted to break out into an Alleluia when I chomped into my pirogies- and even more so when I had Todds- why didn't I ever consider serving pirogies  with Alfredo, broccoli and bacon (and seven pounds of butter)? Not sure- but they did- and it rocked.  The dessert was superior too- chocolate mousse somethingorother and some sort of cheesecake- peanut butter maybe? I forget- but it was also super awesome.  Now, I'll half take back what I said about the beer- the beer was tasty BUT stouts aren't really supposed to be cold...and certainly aren't supposed to force sweat on the glass form."}
{"text":"We've only been to Pittsburgh twice and we've visited this place both times. I mean, a church converted into a brewery?! That's just awesome.  I greatly enjoyed sitting in a pew and drinking a beer, plus every beer I've tried has been great: the first time I visited I chose a red ale and the second time I tried their winter ale, plus I tried my partner's tripel belgian and our friend's IPA.  On our second visit I ordered a zucchini pasta dish, which was spiraled zucchini with mushroom and lentil falafel-like balls and tomato sauce, it was pretty good, but way too salty and they should seriously cut back on the amount of salt they use in that dish. If I were reviewing just my dish, I would give 3 stars, but since the concept is so cool and the beer is great, 4 is fair. We also ordered pita and hummus and that was delicious.  I'd definitely go back, but I wouldn't order the same meal again."}
{"text":"I am a fan, of the architecture and ambience of this building, and the stone oven pizzas. I'm not a fan of their average beer, food prices, mediocre service.  It's a great place to bring in out-of-towners. To me it's a seen it, liked it, move on."}
{"text":"Everone goes for the beer and the food I go for the Moscow Mules and the view. I have tried the beer and the food and both are ok.  No matter how many times you go you always spot something you never noticed before, it is a beautiful place. Why not 5 stars.. it always smells like an old well... but after a mule or 2... who cares... lol."}
{"text":"The beer is okay but this is NOT a good representation of what pierogis should taste like.  The cook is clearly not Eastern European at all and just pretending to make a hunky menu for the Polish Hill community. I wish it was better but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Darren took me here before I joined Yelp, and I liked it as much then as I did the other night.   The Coconut Stout beer was scrumptious.   Our server Megan was all-around awesome.   I loved the Wild Boar Quesadillas and the Belgian Fries with that superyummy lemon-caper aioli.  My Chicken Madrid was excellent. The braised chicken came with sofrito, smoked pineapple, crispy polenta, and a salad of fennel, radish and celery. So good!!!   Darren and I both shared the Chocolate Mousse Cake and the Malted Bread Pudding with malted chocolate ice cream, and they were each amazing.   We never smelled anything funny. The interiors are huge and gorgeous and resemble a chatty dining hall.  If this place is a \"tourist trap\" (and I don't understand the debbie downer reviews it's been getting lately), I am trapped! I love Church Brew Works and recommend it a bunch."}
{"text":"I suppose I'd prefer to give it 3 1/2.  It's a great place - the atmosphere is unique, and it's huge.  The food is pretty good.  I've never been blown away, but I've also never been totally disappointed either.  Their pizzas are one of their best 'bar' dishes.  Their perogies are pretty tasty too.  I had their buffalo meatloaf once which was really good, but you need to ask for an extra side of sauce because it is a bit dry.  During the October/November season, they have apple cider spiked with Captain Morgan which is possibly one of the best drinks I've ever had there.  Their bread pudding is also very good, but very large."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come to this place for a while and I finally got to about a month ago. The beer was just OK but the atmosphere was really cool (being in an old church and all) and the food was actually fantastic! My fiancee and I got the bruschetta and the corn dogs and they were both amazing. I definitely recommend coming to try a flight of beers and their food!"}
{"text":"GREAT beer but I think the food is over priced. It is absolutey beautiful and at least go one time to experence the total unique-ness of the place :)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Sunday afternoon and it was fairly quiet. We were seated immediately, the waiter was friendly and attentive. We ordered drinks, I got a stout and some non-traditional pierogies. I enjoyed them both very much. Since I drove, I only had the one drink. My girlfriend and I ordered the bison meatloaf and my buddy ordered the pork chop. My girlfriend thought the meatloaf was awesome, but my buddy didn't like his pork chop, based on his difficulty cutting into it, I could see why.   The ambiance is what did it for me. I had a quiet, relaxing, and peaceful dinner with a couple of my favorite people. I loved the stained glass and other decorative details in this old church.   To sum it all up, this is a case where I wished Yelp gave us to use of half stars. I'm reluctantly giving this place 4 stars, it's hard to ignore my buddy's experience with his pork chop.   The beer, service, and ambiance is great, the food menu is just OK depending on what you order."}
{"text":"Immediately this brewery scores so many points for its unique setting.  As the name suggests, this brewery is located in a former St. John the Baptist Church.  You would never know from the front that it was a brewery.  In fact, when I approached I was convinced that the smaller building next to it was the brewery and the large 8,000 square foot building was an actual operating church.  I was totally wrong.  The entire church is the brewery.  As you walk inside there are pamphlets like those you might find in a church, but these tell all about the brewery.  The inside is set up as a church too!  The tables are set up where the aisles would be.  There is a church organ in the back and beautiful stained glass windows along the side of the structure.  In the front, in place of the pulpit are the huge brew tanks.  To continue church theme, they have beers such as Celestial Gold, Pipe Organ Pale Ale and Pious Monk Dunkel.  The building is really beautiful and one of the most remarkable backdrop for beer drinking.  I sat at the bar and had a beer flight so that I could sample as many of their beers as possible.  On this particular day there were eight for me to enjoy.  My beer coaster had the motto \"On the eighth day man invented beer\".  I appreciate when a proper beer establishment like this one also posts a giant board with the name of each beer as well as the ABV and IBU of each one.  The beers were all superb and had a nice twist on the norm.  The wit beer had all kinds of spices and the porter had a hint of coconut to separate them from the usual suspects you may find at other bars.  Church Brew Works sells growlers, bottles and even mini kegs.  They also provide a sweet stainless steel growler option.  The food was terrific too which is always enjoyable to pair with beer.  And it was not the typical greasy \"bar food\" fare, but actual \"restaurant\" food.  I had the opportunity to try my first ever pierogie and it was super.  Church Brew Works is easily in my top ten of overall worldwide breweries.  Meet up as SFLHops to the next beer event at http://www.meetup.com/Craft-Beer-in-the-Tri-County-Beer-its-Good-for-You/"}
{"text":"Great craft brews. Outstanding food. A tad too noisy during prime time, but not enough to dock points.  Tourist trap? Far from it. Places like this (and D's) make me wish I lived in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I am an out of towner and we heard this place is all the rage. And it is!!! The beer selection was extensive (if you like IPAs, this place is for you). I was impressed by the waiter's knowledge of each beer. My other half got the beer sampler, an excellent way to try a little bit of everything. As far as food goes, everything I tried was delicious. My favorite was my entree - potato and cheese pierogi with garlic sauce (I also opted for the addition of pancetta). I couldn't finish it all, but I so wanted to! I was stuffed. If we visit again, I will probably be trying the pizza from their bar menu. Last thing - how cool to turn an old church into a brewery!? Thumbs up for originality!"}
{"text":"Extremely unique venue with great food.  I would advise coming in regularly to try the seasonal beers as they tend to run out quickly."}
{"text":"came here on a trip and i found this place on yelp. it sounded like a fun place to try. The food was average, i actually found myself liking the buffalo meatloaf more than the kobe beef i ordered. i got the beer sampler, and they were out of a few of the beers. it was fun, and loud which i actually liked."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend of mine while visiting Pittsburgh.   We were driving down some street and I noticed this old church-style building with a big sign that read BREW WORKS outside. On a spur of the moment decision, my friend pulled the most illegal u-turn to pull into a side street while we went on a new adventure.   Inside, I couldn't decide if I was walking into Sunday mass (this also happened to be a Sunday that we went) or if it was a restaurant. All of the original stained glass windows are still in place, and where the alter used to be is where they now have all of their beer.   We sat at the bar and ordered a sampler platter of beer to try. It came on this cool place-mat with descriptions of each beer that we were drinking. The bartender was very nice and helped us with every question we could come up with.   The food was alright. Better than average I would say. But it seems like you don't come here for the food so much as you do the setting and for their beer. It was an awesome experience that I wish I get to experience again the next time I am in PA.   Plus, we got our picture taken for the local newspaper for a story on this place! Couldn't get any better than that! Definite recommendation in my book"}
{"text":"What a cool find! Went to brunch in Lawrenceville and decided to walk down Liberty to save the Uber cab fare. So glad we did! At first glance, it just looked like a run of the mill church. We almost walked clear past it until I saw the flags waiving with BREW on them. Immediately decided that this needed further inspection. Such an amazing/beautiful space. The beer was great. Didn't have a chance to try the food since we were still full from brunch, but if we make it back to Pittsburgh, we will definitely need to make a second stop."}
{"text":"get sloshed in a.. church.  heck yeah!  whoever thought of putting a microbrewery in a church is a genius.. try the 5 spice beer.  food is not bad.  stay away from the pittsburg salad.  french fries on top of salad is not a good combination.  come on pittsburg.. u can come up with something better than that!"}
{"text":"You come here for the cool setting in a church. Do not expect fast service, quality craft brew or stellar food. Came with a large group of 8, called ahead for a party reservation and was sat 10 min after. Not bad. Service was slooooow, sloth slow. Took 20 min for anyone to even look at us/take our drink order. Food was alright. Friend ordered ribs and grits, food was lukewarm and grits were very lumpy. All the food was very overpriced. Got the sampler, beers were whatever, not memorable. But the setting is cool!"}
{"text":"Tourists always want to come here, and it's a very impressive building and a great renovation to turn a church into a brewpub. But the food and service are just average. The menu is pretty large, but your best choice is in the pizza options, which tend to be fresher and more flavorful than the sandwiches and entrees. Beer is decent.  Plus: A large space with big tables.  Minus: noisy, chaotic, slow service  Plus: They always have peirogi (usually traditional plus a rotating nontraditional pierogi)  Minus: Not very good food (a friend of mine ordered this \"pierogi casserole\" dish that was super greasy and overcooked).   If you want to take your out-of-town guests out for pierogi, I recommend Butterjoint instead, they have excellent food and drinks."}
{"text":"So, my review is not really indicative of the quality of the food, although if I were reviewing that, I'd probably give it like 2.5 stars. Thoroughly average fare, really. The beer is nice, but nothing to get too excited about. Moving on.  I ended up here with a party of 12, celebrating a co-worker's impending move to California. I ordered the grilled salmon with polenta, and it was ok. Again, nothing special, until I took my second bite of polenta and felt something crunch in my mouth. Since polenta is not supposed to be crunchy, I did a double take and took the crunchy thing out, rather than swallow it. This turned out to be an excellent decision because the crunchy thing was actually a piece of glass. Not only that, but when I cut into the middle of the polenta again (on the grounds of \"this merits further investigation\") I found *another* piece of glass! Right there in the middle! Not huge shards (about the size of my pinky nail) but big enough to cut internally if swallowed. My co-workers and friend that I was with were all witnesses to this.  I'll give CBW credit for handling this about the way you're supposed to: as soon as I told the waiter, he told the manager, who came over and was super apologetic. Obviously comped my meal (I got replacement food) and drinks, and offered me dessert to take home. That's great and all, but even greater would have been just not finding glass in my food. I can see a completely different scenario where I accidentally swallow it and have internal injuries, or even just cut up my mouth; that story doesn't end happily for anyone involved.  Most places you go, you don't expect this to happen. Doubly so for a place that charges $20 a plate. If that's the level of diligence that goes into food preparation at CBW, I don't think I could ever recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is certainly novel for the location and experience.  The old church building is beautifully maintained, and the brewery truly utilizes the space well.  It is worth at least one visit, just to see.   However, I'm not impressed by their beer. Their flagship brews are okay, but dull in flavor.  I have visited twice now, and both times, several of their rotating/seasonal brews had run out, leaving me with a limited menu of their flagships or less-preferred rotating taps.  I opted for the Pumpkin Stout and was pleased, but not blown away.  It is incredibly heavy and I only enjoyed about one half of the glass.   I've never tried their food, due to iffy previous yelp reviews.  If you do plan to eat, allot time for seating.  This place does get very crowded during peak dinner hour."}
{"text":"Lately I have been frequenting the Church Brew Works because of visitors coming into town and because my office really likes to order lunch from there.   This is what I have found. Since I am in summer work out mode I tend to eat salads and protein a ton. What's better than a Buffalo Brgr! I get this as my lunch every so often. Juicy, lean, flavorful, bison, cooked medium well! No bun with a side of broccoli. It keeps me full, tastes wonderful and powers me up for a P90 workout!   I also LOVE the Pulled pork sandwich and Cuban! I did like the pulled pork better when they served it on a pumpernickel raisin bun!   So lets talk fire brick oven pizza! I like simplicity so the mozzarella, basil is my favorite! Pair that with the beer sampler and you have quite a nice Saturday afternoon couples outing!   The last time I went to dine with my family we all ordered different items then shared everything! We had the shrimp carbonara, crispy vegetarian polenta, and the Buffalo and wild mushroom meatloaf. The carbonara was creamy and bacony, just as it should be. The meatloaf was super juicy and had a very good flavor, my dish the veggie polenta was tomato based and just ok, It is perfect option if you are vegan or watching calories!   I just love bringing out of towners here, the majestic space and the ambiance, are unmatched. Be ready to become infused with a hoppy humidity! There is also a cute outdoor patio that is very inviting. Everyone in Pitt should frequent here!   On a side note, I had ordered a pizza to go for my family the day we went since they had helped me move. It ended up being burned on the top so check your to go's! Management was extremely accommodating and hooked me up with a pie when I brought my friend for the sampler! Thanks Brew works!!"}
{"text":"Sippin beer and church pews in the bathroom. Sounds weird right?    We went here for a staff dinner our first night in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere was visually awesome.  So many things to look at and the beer was amazing.  I will say if you intend to take advantage of the specials of the day, you should plan to get out earlier in the evening."}
{"text":"Sacreliscious!!  A brewery in a church.    God is proof that Beer loves us and wants us to be happy."}
{"text":"I lived down the block from CBW for three years, frequented often. I think the food is pretty good, the atmosphere is nice, and the beers are delicious. However, I recently went back a month or two ago and the pizza menu was no longer. I was pretty bummed about the fact that the main thing on the menu that I loved was no longer available. Especially when that was a HUGE draw to eating there.   Anyway, it's delicious, people love it. I just wish the 'za was back."}
{"text":"Gorgeous building that makes for an experience in and of itself. Solid beer choices, all brewed in-church (get it?). Pirogies were solid and BBQ sandwich and sweet potato fries were delicious. Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Rightfully so, there is an extremely long wait for Church Brew Works during peak times.  The Saturday night we were there, it was a 2 hour wait.    Make sure you stalk the bar patrons so you can snag a table in the bar area...those are first-come-first-serve!  The service at Church Brew Works is like any other bar...it varies with the server you get.  If you are a beer fan (and c'mon, who isn't) you gotta try one of their specialty brews.  The drinks were fantastic as well as the food.  All in all a fun experience!    And I didn't even have to confess my sins (thank God; pun intended :-)."}
{"text":"Congratulations, Church Brew Works, for making it on to the opening scene of the movie 'Zack and Miri'. You looked great in that shot, as usual - beautiful and confident. You do the city of Pittsburgh proud.  As for my 3 star rating, I just don't think this is the place to go for good food. For a cool place to drink and chill with your friends, this location is okay. And, of course great for tourists and returning ex-locals. But, it's definitely not somewhere I'd go regularly to grab a bite and gulp. If you do need to order something, I'd recommend the pierogies.   Church Brew Works is like the movie star that doesn't have to impress on things that matter (like food) because they have the looks and fame already."}
{"text":"I really like this place and am a frequent patron on my regular trips to Pittsburgh. The brews are fresh and the selection is awesome. The food is typically good pub-grub...nothing exotic but hearty and tasty. The decor maintains the beauty of this old church...terrific stained glass work.  Probably an extra half star if the bartenders that worked here were a bit more interactive. The wait staff is pleasant and helpful but the folks behind the bar generally act as though they're doing you a favor drawing a cold one...what's up with that? The space can tend to 'echo' a bit but a nice place to spend an hour or two with friends."}
{"text":"Our lager,  Which art in barrels,  Hallowed be Thy drink,  Thy will be drunk,  At home as I am in the tavern...  Ok, now that that's over with I do have to say this is by far the coolest brewpub I've ever been to. Granted, it's a long way away in PA, but thankfully I get to take regular trips to get my pierogi and church fix.   Not like I really needed a church fix.  Anyway, here's my lowdown: - Get the beer sampler and then choose the beer you want. That is, of course, if you don't already live in Pittsburgh and don't know what the hell kind of beer they brew.  - Then get the IPA. It's hoptastic.  - Order some pierogies. There are two types - unusual and usual. Why get usual? Go for the unusual.  - Then there's a pierogi pizza. If you're getting the pierogi appetizer you probably don't need a whole pizza. But I'm real tempted to go back and try it because honestly, pierogi pizza. Some Italian Russian is spinning in his grave.  - Skip the pulled pork sandwich and beer cheese. Neither is all that good or special or memorable.  Oh - and make sure you use the bathroom. I don't know about the men's room, but the ladies is awesome. It's like a choir green room in a bar! A BAR IN A CHURCH! AH!!!!!!  And the booths use the pews for chairs! Gar! I love this place."}
{"text":"Tourist trap - avoid.  So, I knew this place was going to be a tourist trap just by the concept - it's a brewery set up in a church.  But okay - let's be honest, the idea of drinking in a church is pretty funny - so we came here with lowered expectations... and it still wasn't great.  So - the service was pretty good and there's free parking... that's where the good points end.  We didn't grab any food here - but we sampled all the beers.  Nothing stood out and they sold out of their IPA.  Bleh.  The church itself was pretty unremarkable.  There are some stained glass windows, but it's pretty dark and unexpectedly muggy (I guess it makes sense considering all the brewery gear inside an old church).  I usually don't rag on places for decor -- but let's face it - you only come here to drink in an old church.  The odd mixture of old church, Pittsburgh sports flags and brewery equipment behind plexiglass wasn't too appealing.  I think they would have been better off if they doubled-down on the church concept - instead, it feels like a theme restaurant.  Once again, AVOID.  The beer sucks and not worth the trek."}
{"text":"The quick rundown:  - Pretty decent selection of pretty decent beer. Nothing mindblowingly amazing, but above-average across the board, at about the price you would pay for an American macro elsewhere.   - The pizza is quite good; other than that, everything is respectable but I don't know that I'd call it 'good.'  - Relaxed atmosphere, interesting setting.  - $13 filled growler is an absolute steal.  From a general food-centric standpoint, this rates at a 3.5. For people who enjoy beer greatly, this is closer to a 4."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and they were really hyping this place in the days leading up to our visit.  Maybe they'd built it up waaaaay too much for us because although I wasn't disappointed by the food or beer, I wasn't driven to ecstasy like St Teresa of Avila.  The architecture of the place is the main draw here - it's a restaurant/brewery built in an old church and that's really the most fun part.  Once you're over that, it's a microbrewery & restaurant plain and simple.  The food was good - I ordered the pierogies because 'when in Pittsburgh...'; those were fine, but... I was focusing on my delicious Celestial Gold beer.  My wife had a pork-chop encrusted in chorizo which could've been interesting but was rather boring.  The entrees seemed expensive to me.  Maybe not though... maybe that's Pittsburgh prices or something.  The beers were pretty good - Knowing what I know, I would probably just skip the dinner next time and just come here for drinks and the pub-grub.  Did I mention the beer was really good?  It was really good.  One minor annoyance was the extremely long wait for the check - there was probably something wrong with the register because even the waitress mentioned she was sorry for the long delay."}
{"text":"Such an interesting and mixed experience.    Atmosphere: Very cool.  Your booth is a pew.  The interior is gorgeous.  Its awesome.  The Service: Quite underwhelming.  Waited a LONG time before we saw a server.  When he eventually showed up he was good, but he was obviously milking a big group for a big tip while we sat and waited.  The Food: Delicious pot pie, decent cheesesteak sandwich, underwhelming perogis.  The Beer: Had one great \"Fresh Hop\" ale and then one kind of lousy Pale Ale (weak carbonation).  I'm glad we went to enjoy the experience.  If service improves it would be an excellent destination."}
{"text":"This was one of the coolest breweries I have ever been to. The atmosphere is incredible. The seating is made up of pews and old chairs from a church, the stained glass windows are breathtaking, and they have the brewing equipment set up at the church alter. On top of the atmosphere, the beers were delicious. I am a fan of dark beer, and the two that I tried were great! My husband had the flight, and he really enjoyed it as well. The 7 onion soup was phenomenal, and the pierogies were pretty tasty. The pepperoni roll was a bit different, as it was deep fried, but despite the untraditional take on it, it was delicious. I would love to return here again when I am in Pittsburgh for my next visit to see family!"}
{"text":"I've been to CBW a few times and to be quite honest, it's always been mildly disappointing. The best part about it is the building, which I always get a kick out of. This last time I was there, the service was so bad that I don't think I'll be going again.  Our group went there on a Saturday at about 4:00 and it was packed. Since we had 7 people, the hostesses suggested we eat at the open bar table, so that's where we sat, which was our biggest mistake. They seemed to have only 2 servers working the bar area. The only time we saw ours, she was running to get to our table, but we never saw her working any others, so I don't know if she was truly busy or just slacking. She apologized a lot, but service never improved, it was just laughably slow. One of my friends took to ripping up the cardboard coasters out of frustration and hunger, another joked about creating a Yelp account just to review the terrible experience.   Our meal took 2 hours and all we got were pizzas, salads, and appetizers. We all had our cards waiting for about 15 minutes by the time our server brought the checks over and we tried to hand them to her immediately, but she ran away while we were calling out \"Wait!\" and \"Here you go!\" It took another 10 minutes for her to come back for them. The dining side of the restaurant seemed to be moving just fine, so some blame for our experience probably lies with the hostesses, who encouraged us to take the hightop at the bar rather than wait for them to pull tables together to fit our party.   The food varies from fine to good, the portions can be small for some of the specialty items (my friend's crab dumplings app was 4 pieces, one without any crab and was $10), the beer is not very good, expect the Dunkel."}
{"text":"This place is a must see. It's all about the experience really. Walking through the doors of a once Roman Catholic Church for dining is truly unique. We never forgot that we were dining in an old church. Beautiful building inside and out with stain glass and pipe organ nestled in the back of the church. The beer was fantastic! The food was very good but the menu was not what I was expecting. They didn't have the normal pub menu choices but that did make it unique. The beet salad with honey vinaigrette and goat cheese was good and the Cajun sweet potatoes were the best I've had.  Main complaint was parking was hard to find on the weekend and the food was pricey. The beer was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Took our out of town family here over the Thanksgiving holidays and they enjoyed the atmosphere but the service left something to be desired.  Our waitress seemed a bit flighty/distracted and we thought it was due to the crowd but found out later that we were only one of two tables she had so not sure why she was struggling.    It took a while for beers to be replenished and in one incident she said that they were replacing the tap for the IPA and when we followed-up with her about it when no beer arrived 15 minutes later, she said she would ask but then stopped herself and said that she remembered they ran out...What?!?!  I was thinking to myself at what point where you going to mention that and that's an important detail to remember when there's a table of thirsty individuals waiting for beers.  Needless to say, that's where the night ended.  For food, we ordered the \"featured\" pierogies which had a thousand island dressing with mushroom filling.  It was suprisingly good - I didn't think thousand island dressing on pierogies would be good but it worked.  Also ordered the spinach, feta, gouda dip with the \"oven-fired\" flatbread but was disappointed as the flatbread was cold and didn't seem \"oven-fired\" at all.  The dip was \"meh\" - not that great.  We also ordered the pesto mushroom pizza and four cheese pizza which were very tasty.  More than enough for 5 people to share."}
{"text":"One of the most interesting dining options which is a historic landmark. Great history, large menu and great staff."}
{"text":"Had a great afternoon meal at The Church Brew Works yesterday. On a previous trip to Pittsburgh we had tried to eat there but found not a single spare seat and did nothing more than peek in the door. This time we arrived around 2pm on Saturday and there were plenty of seats available. I won't speak to the coolness of the actual space as I'm sure many others before me have done a great job. Only thing I will say is how cavernous it is but yet you feel cozy - the low lighting helps lend itself to that mood as do the bright stained glass windows.  We started with the pierogi's of course (un-traditional). These were a mix of kielbasa, potato, and onion on the inside and on the top a mustard and horseradish sauce. Wish I had ordered more because they were gone way to quickly! I ordered the lunch size (9\") Portabello Pesto pizza and Dave ordered the Artichoke, Spinach, and Feta pizza. We both preferred the Portabello by far but both were yummy. Andy had a Char-Grilled Buffalo burger with spiced fries and said he enjoyed it.   Dave and Andy ordered the Pipe Organ Pale Ale and the Celestial Gold. Consensus was for the Celestial Gold. Andy also ordered a bottle of Quadzilla - a Belgian Style Cherry Wheat and I found it similar to Lambic (one of two kinds of 'beer' which I do drink) and very tasty.  Overall - I would recommend it to friends/family and hope to go again.  PS - I think it's funny that there were 33 votes for Alcohol: None in the survey :-P"}
{"text":"this place.  this place is just..  well its just awesome.  went there for the first time a couple weeks ago and i'm sorry that i'm just now writing this review, because i can't remember the name of the bartender, but let me tell you about what i DO remember - this guy was incredible.  he honestly made our experience unforgettable and because of him, we will most definitely be going back.  I didnt eat any food, but the 2 people i were with got pizzas, and they seemed to enjoy them.  then of course, there's the beer.  now, i'm not a huge beer drinker, but if i was, this place would be my go to.  sure there are other great places to grab a local (or not-so-local) beer, but how many of them are brewed and served inside of a church?  The inside of this place was incredible.  I loved how they kept the church feel to the building, but then, of course, there's all the beer.    This place is just a really great, different kind of place to go grab a drink and some food, and, if your lucky, arguably the best bartender in PGH."}
{"text":"I took my friend here for her 21st birthday tonight, and we had a great time! This was such a cool restaurant/brewery. I'm so glad she mentioned it, otherwise I may have never found this place hidden behind the old church exterior.   I had the cranberry mule, and my friend had some kind of specialty beer. Both drinks were perfect. We also ordered the pulled pork nachos, and beef brisket sandwich. The food was delicious as well. I would like to note that the nachos were extraordinarily delicious. They had this slight tropical twist to them with the sauce and the pineapples on them. I've never had nachos like such, but it complemented the dish beautifully.   The exterior is so deceiving... you would never guess there is a beautiful restaurant hall inside. I love how they kept most of the old church images and style while adding their own Pittsburgh twist with the brewers.  Also, I'm thankful for the parking lot behind the building. There is little parking on the street, and it saves the hassle of searching for parking."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience here. My mom was in town visiting me and my boyfriend, it was her first time in Pittsburgh and we wanted to take her to get some pierogies. I'd heard so many good things about this place and was really excited to try it for the first time. The restaurant itself is beautiful, the old church that it's in is gorgeous. Our server was pleasant enough, but after we were seated there were immediately problems.   The first issue was that the plates that were brought out to us were dirty, like very visibly dirty with dark marks on them. We got new plates brought out to us, but we were really surprised that plates that dirty were given to us in the first place. When the pierogies we ordered were brought out to us, they were all cold and, on top of being cold, they were flavorless.  The manager who came to speak to us didn't seem particularly caring about what happened, he just offered to bring us new pierogies and didn't seem particularly concerned or apologetic about our experience. We just wanted to go at that point and so we paid for our drinks and left without eating. We ended up buying some of the Mrs.T's pierogies from the grocery store and making those at home and they were much much better than the ones we were served at this restaurant. Very very let down overall and I will not be back."}
{"text":"A fun place to go with a big group of people.  GREAT selection of beers.  I had the pierogies last time I was there and they were excellent.  Also tried a bit of someone's pizza and it was excellent as well.    Can't beat a place that has great food, beer, and interesting atmosphere."}
{"text":"For people into the basics here it is short n' sweet:  Location/Building: 5/5 Beautiful. Unique. Interesting. Very open and airy. A distinct smell of yeast and a mix of delicious food smells.  Service: 2.5/5 I'm horribly disappointed by our reservation not being a reservation at all and really rushing our meal which had originally intended to go from around 8pm - 10pm.  Food: 2/5 While it was not bad food by any means, for the price I could make entire meals with far more flavor. The portions were big, but even big portions of mediocre food isn't all that great.  Beer: 5/5 Outstanding. I will definitely be back for more beer, and maybe I'll allow the food another pass.   The details:  I went to the Church Brew Works for the first time last night. I pass it twice a day 5 days a week and I've been curious for ages as to this fabled fine eatery and brew house within a church. I have to say though, maybe my expectations were too high.   The entire point of going was for a friend's birthday gathering. An initial party of maybe 15. She had called days ahead and they said they could accommodate us. Upon arriving we were told it wasn't actually a \"reservation\" so much as a \"request.\" Regardless of the fact that we had told them how many, what day, and the exact time DAYS in advance. After sitting for 15 minutes we down graded the party to 12 as some people hadn't shown. We grabbed some Pumpkin Stouts and waited another 30 minutes before downgrading to the 9 of us that had shown up and we still waited nearly 10 minutes more.   Being under some time constraints this really put a damper on the evening. Although after the almost 50 minute wait we walked through the restaurant which is lovely with gorgeous high ceilings, a festive air, and a glass wall behind the altar through which you can see some of the brewing happening. We were seated on the altar which provides an amazing view of the entire restaurant. Our waiter was efficient, friendly, and apologetic for the wait. We had quick service and refills as often as we needed them. The food though, this is where I was really turned off from ever coming back for a meal.   They have two menus; a regular and a pub menu. The regular is very pricey and the pub menu is moderate to somewhat pricey. We all ended up ordering from the pub menu and while the food tasted good I don't think it was worth the 8$ - 12$ a pop. At all."}
{"text":"Do you have friends in town and want to take them to some showy Pittsburgh haunt (ok I have to call it touristy even)? You can't go wrong with the Church Brew works: quirky atmosphere for a brewery with the high ceilings of a cathedral and the filtered light from the stained glass. Decent selection of seasonal beers but nothing to knock my socks off. Back in the day they had a lavender girly girl kind of beer that was special but I haven't seen it lately.  Now it should say something that it never ever crosses my mind to go there to get a pint unless I have newbies in town."}
{"text":"Beer was good but food was just ok.  Ordered the Gouda dip and paella.  Dip was luke warm and paella was over spiced."}
{"text":"Amazing!  What a unique location for a brewery.  And they saved the church from demolition.  The beer is really good.  Tried several and they were all tasty.  A great place."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place, though it's not for the regular menu so much as the \"bar\" menu that they have.     I would say that their steak sandwich made with Kobe beef is one of the better (though not best) steak sandwiches I have had.    It is amplified even more when combined with one of their beers (more on that later).       The second item I am a big fan of is the pulled pork sandwich, the sauce on this sandwich is house made using their Pios Monk Dunkel.   I just had this when I was here last week for the first time and I will definitely be back.    Alright....so really the thing that puts this place up on the list....beer....in a converted Catholic Church.   I know it's a gimmick....but it works...and the beer is great, I have historically been a fan of their seasonal stouts, or if you are looking for a consistent beer always on the menu check out the Dunkel."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the lesser known gems of Pittsburgh. The inside is absolutely gorgeous and it's more upscale than I expected the first time I went there. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I can say the food is amazing.  My only reason for giving only 4 stars is my drink was too strong."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Detroit, and this was the first place that we stopped at since I hadn't been here in over 10 years. The service was horrible. It took 45 minutes for them to bring our food, and all we had were simple things that wouldn't take long in the kitchen. The service was horrible. Once the food was brought, it was nothing that was impressive. It tasted like cafeteria food. If you come here, it's definitely for the ambiance, the beer, and the pizza. Very disappointed with the desserts and appetizers as well."}
{"text":"This place combines unique ambiance with great food and drink. I'd seek it out next time I am in Pittsburgh!  I went here for the first time during happy hour with a few friends. The amber ale was fantastic (better than the stout IMO), and I've tried a ton of good beers being from Colorado.  They have a lot of good options on the menu, but they had me at pierogis! The traditional pierogis were delicious - just the right amount of crispy edges and delicate filling. Next time I'll try the non-traditional version or the buffalo pierogi entree!"}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is more of an experience than a restaurant. The food is good but certainly not the best I've ever had. However, the beautiful scenery makes the trip worth it.  The tall cathedral ceilings and stained glass are breathtaking. The beer is pretty good too. If you're not a fan of hops though, it may not be for you. Also, They do not carry ciders. I'm hoping they carry 1 or 2 types in the future because it would widen their base.  They used to offer pizzas but this no longer is the case. I wish I could give this Venue 5 stars but the food, although good, could improve."}
{"text":"I've wanted to visit Church Brew Works ever since I first heard about it several years ago from my family. Craft brews in a unique atmosphere is right up my alley, so I was psyched when a recent trip to Pittsburgh to visit \"my people\" allowed us to visit.   The weather was perfect, so we opted to sit in the outside garden, but we retired to the inside for a final beer so that we could enjoy the gorgeous interior.   We started with the spinach and cheese dip, which was fine, and came with some unremarkable tortilla chips. My baby kale salad was pretty good (with homemade ricotta and nicely grilled chicken) and the boy's pierogi sauté pretty solid with a tasty sauce that made the dish.   Church Brew Works seems like a great place in the neighborhood for friends to get together - it was even semi-busy on a Wednesday night. We definitely enjoyed our trip and got some beers to take back to Philly."}
{"text":"I had a Philly which was okay, but next time I'm getting a pizza! The environment is really cool, very unique idea"}
{"text":"The beer was decent, but the ambience was AWESOME! They turned a Historical Catholic Church into a brewery! It was super cool because it felt like you could be in mass one minute and drinking a beer the next. Must see!!!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. Our waiter was pretty outgoing but at the end took forever to give us our bill. He's got the right attitude but when there's only 5 of us in the entire restaurant, it should not take that long to bill me out.   The inside decor is beautiful and very spacious. The stained glass and the rest of the interior was fascinating to look at while we ate lunch.    The food itself was also not very appetizing. I went with the Bahn Mi Steak sandwich, which had sriracha mayo on top of the sandwich inside of spread inside. Made it very difficult to eat. It also had basil which I could barely taste. Not enough meat for the high priced sandwich and the fries were very bland. Their tripple was a very tasty beer. They do have a huge beer menu, but unfortunately none were available. Overall I wouldn't be returning."}
{"text":"Now this is my kind of church!!  I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing when I made my first visit earlier this week!  It was a real church, serving food and beer.....and I loved it!  We had the wood-fired pizza and some Celestial Gold.  Beer was good, and pizza (Spinach, Feta and Artichoke) was excellent.  Service was good as well.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Way to create customer loyalty not taking a To Go order at 9:02pm when your kitchen closed at 9:00. Well done!  I love your food and I live in the neighborhood but will most likely start ordering take out from other places instead of CBW like I have been every other week for the past 6 months."}
{"text":"When I lived in Iowa, I would come to Pittsburgh to visit my girlfriend. One of the first places we went out to eat was here. We got a pizza and a microbrew and both were simply amazing. I flew back home reminiscing about the perfect crust, the chewy and substantial cheese and the sauce which exploded with flavor.   Since then, my girlfriend (now wife) have come back numerous times. Only problem: we can't remember what it was we ordered that first night. By now, we have tried virtually everything on the pizza menu, and all are very good--well above average--but we have yet to have a repeat of that first experience. Perhaps it was just the magic of budding romance that made everything taste so good.   At any rate, we bring out of town friends here often since the space is so neat--high ceilings and pipe organs towering next to glossy stills. The beers are complex and classy--a must try."}
{"text":"Interesting place, a few ok beers, but chef needs to step up his game. The fettuccine was closer to infamous than famous."}
{"text":"When you grow up catholic you either keep to your faith or try everything you can to escape it. The latter is me. But a church that's been turned into a brewery...that I must see.  My husband and I arrived at opening so we basically had our pick of where to sit. We chose the bar in front of a beautiful stained glass window. We decided to share a flight of all their regular offerings (see what I did there?) and of their special brews.  The beer here was average, no one in particular made us crave a full pint. But the room is beautiful. I loved that most of their stills were on the alter, a sacred space if you will. Surprisingly, it wasn't loud when it got busier. Maybe it was because everyone automatically speaks in hushed tones in a church, or maybe they did some fantastic sound dampening.  We sadly won't be returning, but we do recommend it to people who have never been for the experience alone."}
{"text":"Let's just say this place was the first time I could say \"I'm going to Church!\"  I love the whole concept of turning an old (and beautiful) church into a brewery!  The ceilings are so high and the whole floor plan is just open.  You can see every corner of the room and it's so inviting.  One tip a friend offered is to sit on the bar side to get beer specials and a cheaper menu.    We actually had a fairly large group so it was impossible to find seating for all of us at the bar on a Friday night around 8:30 pm.  Instead, the hostess accommodated us with a long family style table in the corner and we were still able to order off the bar menu!  I started off with the Pious Monk Dunkel, which was an exceptionally smooth and tasty lager.  I followed up with a spiced ale, which was surprisingly pleasant and fitting to the season.  Many of us tried the Buffalo Burger, which they all raved about and made us all wish we had ordered the same.  Love this place and hope to return to try some more brews and the Buffalo Burger!  Note: there is also outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very neat environment, good food (particularly the pizzas), and works for a romantic evening or a family dinner."}
{"text":"My review for Church Brew Works is solely on the beer experience since I did not have a chance to try the delicious looking food.  Ordered the flight to get a taste of what Church Brew Works was all about, but I was not impressed at all.  The flavors were underwhelming and flat.  The rotating stout was the only one that was halfway decent.  However, one does not get to drink beer in church very often!  And in a beautiful church nonetheless.  So, the experience alone is worth a visit.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll have to try the grub..that meatloaf looks heavenly ;)"}
{"text":"I actually have Catholic guilt for not reviewing Church Brew Works until now as I've been here countless times over the years.  And Catholic guilt is appropriate for this venue as, obviously, \"Church\" Brew Works is located in a very old Catholic Church.    When you walk in if you're Catholic, by habit, you'll want to dip your hands into the Holy Water holder that is sans Holy Water.  But your eyes will immediately go to the old altar that now holds large vessels that are brewing and fermenting some pretty great beer.  That being said, be aware that you're going to smell some pretty strong malty-sweet aromas from the brewing.  On my most recent visit it was stronger than I would have preferred.  But no fear, we were able to sit outside, which is like transforming yourself into a scene from Harvard in the late 1800's.  The little courtyard patio outside is two levels surrounded by brick walls covered in ivy.  You can sit with a small group or bring all your friends and grab the picnic table with the long bench.  Either scenario is going to be great.  Onto the food.  Oh how I love the menu here.  I always want to go for the wood fired pizzas because they rock - and there are so many culinary treats to choose from like pierogie pizza or chicken and pineapple or wild boar BBQ.  That's right, I said Wild Boar and I'm not lying.  Amazing thin crust wood fired to perfection.    The menu typically has a salmon or some sort of fish but what you can always count on is a delicious pierogie option.  You're in Pittsburgh and Church Brew Works does their pierogies right.  On my most recent visit I had buffalo chicken pierogies and truth be told (we were in church so I cannot tell a lie) there wasn't a crumb left on my plate.    If you have friends in town visiting Pittsburgh for the first time or the tenth impress them by taking them to Church Brew Works.  Because I guarantee that they'll go back to their hometown and will tell all their friends about this awesome treasure.  Amen."}
{"text":"\"On the 8th day, there was Beer!\" Ya gotta LOVE ChurchBrewery! The stained glass is beautiful, the seating great for large parties and the brewing kegs are at the alter! I really enjoyed their dunkel monk beer the best, it went perfectly with their tasty wood fired pizza! The Perogie of the day appetizer is a \"must\" order! Great spot to bring out of town guests for good beer and a tasty short variety menu of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. The only disappointment was there was no \"steak salad\" and that is an item I miss most from my old home, Pittsburgh... though they sell a Pittsburgh salad... their offering is with chicken and  the fries, of course! So close!! So, I ordered a steak, sold at a hefty price to try to make my own steak salad, it was very small, not worth the high price tag,. Oh well, I suggest you stick with pizza, it is very tasty, everyone agreed on that!  Service is great from the hostess to The servers! Our server was beyond helpful always checking on us and she even split our bill, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Yeah neat they turned a church into a brewery.  Yeah neat their beer is somewhat good and fresh, but to be honest, not all what I'm into.  I did drink the Monk Dunkel for a while (taking home minikegs) when I lived up the street, but now that L-ville is full of great craft beer, I could take this place or leave it.  Heard they recently bought another church, down the street from me in L-ville, and are turning it into condos.  Meh."}
{"text":"Every Pittsburgh resident must go to Church Brew Works at least once. My husband and I have also enjoyed taking friends and family members to this unique establishment. At first, I wasn't sure what to think of a pub located within an old church. As a church-goer myself, I felt that I may be breaking some sort of 11th commandment by drinking there. However, I felt much better when I arrived. The restaurant has done an amazing job of maintaining the beauty of the church while creating an all new environment.  I've enjoyed all of the drinks that I've ordered here but particularly like the Cherry Quadzilla. One complaint would be that they always seem to be out of a beer listed on their permanent menu, which is very annoying. Someone in our group always seems to order an elusive beer which leads to frustration when it's unavailable.  Though a little overpriced, I've enjoyed the traditional pierogies ($6.50) and pizzas ($13-15.50). They are descent, but by no means items that I couldn't find somewhere else for less. I have never tried any of the entrees. Entrees range from $15-34, which all seem overpriced. Though the restaurant is cool, I don't think it's fine dining enough to charge more than $15-20 for entrees.  During my last visit in September, our food took nearly an hour to come out. Every second that we waited felt like a minute due to an unhappy baby being with us, but I did think the wait was a bit long for having just ordered appetizers and pizzas. Note to self -- don't dine there on the weekends if you want to be in and out within an hour.  Though I recommend visiting this restaurant at least once, it's excitement and novelty really lies purely within the location. Enjoy this restaurant with visitors, but don't expect it to become your go-to weekend spot."}
{"text":"We didn't eat but the beer was really good; Pious Monk and Celestial Gold. The atmosphere is amazing, you'll have an awww moment as soon as you walk in. The bartender, \"the old dickhead bartender\", was awesome and made the experience even more enjoyable. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in an old Catholic church which gives it a great atmosphere. The menu is full of great comfort foods. They offered pizza with pierogi toppings which I didn't order and it still haunts me to this day that I didn't get it. It's like my white whale......damn you church brew!"}
{"text":"This place is mayhem on a Saturday night.  We somehow managed to wrestle a tall, four-person bar table right upon arrival so the killer waits and crowd didn't affect us much. There is the waiting list for the restaurant side (right), and the free-for-all that is the bar (left) side. Every man for himself, regardless of how you slice it.  We had the pierogis and 'Belgian' fries to open, and split two pizzas amongst the four of us. The peirogis were excellent; the fries were just fries with a dish of aioli - i guess aioli makes them Belgian. One pizza (pierogi again) was solid, the other struggled with flavor - so much so that I can't even remember what was on it. The crust on that one was also undercooked, with the edges burnt (oven temp issue?). We also had two flights of the beer sampler, and those were excellent. I was checking out non-pizza items all around us and can safely say that the food is probably not great across the board - it looks like a lot of straight up, low-end bar food. That's not horrible, but just advice for the eating side of the world. It's a pretty cool place if you don't mind crowds and noise. Certainly worth a visit."}
{"text":"Every time I leave a church I feel guilty. But today, after leaving Church Beer Works, I feel proud. I tired their Oktoberfest and their Dunkel- both excellent. Go in, have 8, 9, 10 beers, then go back to work. Your day will be made complete. 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool. I heard there were murals on the walls and was sad to see they were painted over with plain blue coloring. The beer was all watery and a Miller Lite drinker's craft beer. The menus were super confusing. There is a beer/drink menu. A restaurant menu and then a separate pub/bar menu. Some items are duplicated and some are on one and not the other. We were given all menus and told anyone can order from any menu...I'd rethink the layout and condense it to 1 menu. The food was mediocre.  The appetizers came out cold...cheese wasn't even melted on the nachos! Our entrees were decent -pizza, steak and potatoes, burgers, chicken wrap, seasonal winter salad. Not the hype I had heard about."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Such a cool atmosphere to be in an old church thats been converted into a great Brewpub. Definitely recommend taking a trip here to grab one of their rated beers, and some good food (Especially the Pierogies)"}
{"text":"The BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich is simply amazing, and the apple coleslaw is the perfect addition. The rotating draft lists are also a great. The atmosphere is unique, and still holds many of the elements of the church, making it a cool place to eat. The dinner menu is slightly pricey, but the sandwiches are very reasonable for the great taste."}
{"text":"Creative beers in a unique, beautiful space. They were on the leading edge of the Lawrenceville revival and so the neighborhood has bloomed around them."}
{"text":"The novelty of  brew-pub in a church is definitely fun, but the food and beer isn't anything special.  The beers are your standard brew-pub selection - light ale, red, IPA, porter, and several seasonal choices.   It's possible you'll find something special, so try a few.  The entrees are a big disappointment - all are prepared ahead of time and just assembled for service.  It's cafeteria food served on nice plates.  They clearly stopped trying years ago.  The bar-food and hand tossed pizza looked more promising - I'd try that next time.  When they ask if you want the dinner or bar side of the aisle, choose the bar."}
{"text":"The only reason worth going here is to ogle the scenery. It's a one-off tourist event, and I don't discourage out-of-towners to visit because everyone loves to drink beer in a fabulous church. However, this is not a place for locals. The food is snooty and over-priced. Head over to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern if you want some good pierogies.   The beer here isn't bad but you have to suffer through the insufferable waitstaff to drink it. Head to Penn Brewery for a good Pittsburgh brewery.   Overall, walk in, look around, get a beer at the bar if you must, and take off for greener pastures."}
{"text":"I am going to  be honest! I find it extremely rude that they actually converted a huge pretty Church into a Brewery.When i visited this place the first time i felt horrible.I felt extremely guilty with the huge brewers placed where Jesus is supposed to be standing and the seats and a huge bar behind and all the chairs well arranged for dining!!     My friends love this place for their good beer and they almost starved themselves to eat the pizza which they claim to be the best pizza ever.But i would also give them credit for being creative and  for having good food and drinks.Thus the 3 stars and -2 stars for being rude .HMPH.     PS-I am not religious nor am i a Christian. Some thing's are just hard to digest.But kudos to your creativity!!! :)  -Smriti"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Totally gorgeous and unique.  Something different if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp and grits...the best I've ever eaten. The salad came in an awkward shaped bowl that wanted to tip over; very difficult to cut (and $6 is a bit pricey for a small side salad).  Great staff, very attentive."}
{"text":"I have a bunch of friends who've been to the Church and I've seen it on several \"must try\" brewery lists and I will say that I would probably enjoy a pint of dirty mop water in that beautiful setting, but if the food and beer were served anywhere else, I don't feel like anybody would have given it a second thought.   We tried a flight of eight beers including a red, IPA, porter, sour and a Dunkelweizen and none of them really stood out, although I probably would have gotten a pint of the sour (by default) if it was later in the day.    Our pizza seemed undercooked and really saucy.  Every time one of us picked up a slice, it went limp and all the cheese slid off.  My French onion soup had a pig glob of cheese in the bottom and cheeseless croutons floating in oil on the top.  My side salad was OK, but pretty basic (at least it had romaine and not iceberg lettuce).   Five stars for the location, three for the beer and two for the food..."}
{"text":"Our meal with the Church Brew Works and Restaurant was a mixed bag.  Plus: My husband's beer was good  Minus: The in-restaurant brewed Birch Beer was watery and mediocre   Plus: The ambiance was great and the building is beautiful  Minus: We had numerous flies around our table  Plus: The vegetarian options were delicious and the brick oven pizzas were great.  Minus: Our waitress was absentee and forgot our waters and my drink when bringing the rest of the tables' drinks. It just seemed like there were too few waiters for such a huge restaurant  Overall, the food and beer make it a great place to bring visiting beer fans, but they could make some minor adjustments to make it a place we'd like to go on a regular basis.  ------------------------------------------------ Update as of 10/18/2009:  I'm increasing my rating by a star because of a followup visit. Our food was delicious, our guests were impressed with the decor, and our waitress was wonderful."}
{"text":"Church Brew used to be a favorite restaurant. When I lived there it was my default place to take out-of-town visitors.  I try to get there at least once when I visit.  The food? Still fantastic. I got one of my favorite pizzas to go (most of it even made it back home).  The service?  The waiter was awesome.  Perfectly attentive without being overbearing.    So what went wrong?  Simple: They keep the handicapped bathroom locked.  The regular bathroom has steps inside.  This is not good for people who have problems with stairs, or in mobility devices.  So they built a separate handicapped bathroom near the front end of the bar.  When I found it locked -- with no sign on the door other than something saying something like \"Please leave this for our handicapped customers.\" -- I assumed someone was in there.  Handicapped people get used to waiting for the handicapped stall.  Sometimes places install baby changing tables in there, and in a crowded bathroom there's no reason to not use the handicapped stall if nobody disabled is waiting.   Yeah, sometimes jerks use it when it's otherwise empty for stupid reasons, \"I like the extra room\" being one of my all-time favorites.  But usually it's no big deal.  Yet after standing there a few, painful moments, one of the folks at the bar informed me that \"nobody has gone in there\" and \"I think they keep it locked.\"  So I hobbled back to the hostess station and asked for the manager.  Eventually a woman came over and identified herself.   I told her that locking the handicapped bathroom was unacceptable, this is not making this \"accessible.\"  She informed me, in a tone that implied that boxes of rocks have greater intelligence than me, that they keep it locked so that \"only handicapped people can use it\" and that this is done \"for the benefit of the handicapped people!\"  I tried to point out that requiring someone to ask for permission to us the bathroom is not accessibility.  She asked if I needed to use the restroom, and when I said, \"yes, that's the point!\" she told the hostess to unlock the bathroom and stalked away.  Although I walk with a cane, not all disabilities are visible. Do they do a health check?  I can see it now, \"I'm sorry, you don't look disabled, go to the regular bathroom!\"  After spending 10 days fruitlessly trying to find normal, accessible housing in Pittsburgh, so I could move back home, this was the crown on the crap king.   Apartments that advertised \"disability access\" but had steps going to the door had nothing on being told that we disabled people need to be protected from the big bad scary able-bodied people using our place to pee.  Thank you, Church Brew Works, for being the symbol of Pittsburgh, The Most Liveable City For Everyone But The Disabled."}
{"text":"Came to Church Brew Works on a Saturday night in early May 2016 to grab food and drinks. Since this is so close to my place in Lower Lawrenceville I had high expectations, but they were easily let down.   Ordered sweet potato fries and pierogi appetizer. Sweet potato fries were cold as ice , and the pierogi appetizer didn't really hit home either.  Partner ordered a beer that was decent on tap , but everything else was lacking. Just seemed like some fancied up bar food , and maybe hit a miss that night with the kitchen. Haven't been back since and don't plan to be.   Hopefully others experience better food , that's hot and warmly served."}
{"text":"umm, a beer hall in a church?  that's even better then a club in a church:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limelight  Interesting choices of beer, great pizza, and a decent menu of dinner choices."}
{"text":"My friend's English department had a small get together here.  Pretty awkward setting of religion with drinking.  It sorta is strange but get over it.  They ripped out the pews but kept some of the chapel windows, etc.  It's not easy to find and my friend circled around until he actually found the church.  Not too well in marking the brewery and need better signage.  Food was average and beer was okay.  Go there for the weird factor and less on the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.  We started with the \"Nontraditional Pierogies\" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.  We also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.  For an entree we had the \"Cinco Formaggio\" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.  We also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.  Our server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!"}
{"text":"It's a spectacle- Good beer and that's about it. Could use some upgrades*  *there is a bizarre cheese/seafood/vomit smell in there that almost turned our group away. The food was 50% good and 50% bland. To top it off, our waiter was obviously not happy to be working and gave us a shitty attitude at every opportunity. Church Brew Works, get it together!!!"}
{"text":"Had a large scale event here and they catered to our needs quite well. Love the food, and love the beer."}
{"text":"The food is just okay here, and the service is usually just average.  I've given this place several tries, and the atmosphere is the best thing about it, and even that wears off a little after your first visit."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the Burgh, this place has yet to let me down.  I love that they have a specials page in the menu, so I make it a point to order something from it every time I visit. From chanterelle soup (with a nice story about the owner picking the mushrooms himself), to the Octoberfest pizza, to the bolognese lasagna, to the special pierogis - nothing on this menu has disappointed me in the least. I like that this part of the menu goes along with the seasons as well, it keeps the food fresh and keeps me on my toes when searching for dinner.  On a special note, the pizza here is definitely underrated. The crust is fantastic and you can actually see the pizza station tucked away in a corner of the church, so you know exactly what work goes into making such a delectable dough delight.  Along with the food, the beer is good as well. One of my pet peeves is a brewery that makes a watery stout (see: rock bottom), and thankfully the beer at the Church meets my expectations. Their seasonal/rotating beers are a great way to switch things up as well, and I have found myself contemplating the finer points in life while enjoying many of their brews.  If you hate good food and good beer, the setting itself is worth a visit. On my first visit, I couldn't believe that this place is actually just a church that was renovated to a brewpub. Stained glass windows - check, pipe organ - check, pews for seating - check. This place has it all.  So go for the food, beer, and atmosphere, get one of the specials and a new beer, and leave happy."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars, but my husband (the craft brew expert) loves this place.  In fact; we usually entertain out of town guests here.    The building is beautiful and it smells like brewing beer.  I just wish the menu lived up to everything else.  The food is good, but that's it.  Just good.  The beer is great and it's a quirky unique place.  Defiantly worth checking out."}
{"text":"First and foremost one must recognize that this is a micro brew that serves food.  The food is good, but it is something you do while you drink beer so you don't drink too much, which you may because they really know what they are doing!  However, of all the micro brews or beer taverns in the area, they have the best food.  It is strange to drink and eat at the \"Church\" Brew Works because I am certain my grandmother took me to mass there as a child from time to time.  But I digress...  The beer and staff are great.  If one of the brew masters are there, which they usually are during the day, please ask them for some samples and suggestions.  If you go in the evening it can be a lot of fun.  The bar can be crowded, but the environment is always pleasant.  Sample many different brews and enjoy a nice bite to eat.  Be sure to take a growler home."}
{"text":"Talk about a one-of-a-kind place, a church that was converted into a brewery. Pure genius! I was told about this place before visiting my friend in Pittsburgh and made it a must stop.  I feel like this is a place you find in some town in Ireland and England, but I think it's a good fit in Pittsburgh. I wish DC had more places like this and less of the wine/tapas bars variety.  I really like how the owner kept the original decor of the church intact and didn't try to alter it too much.  This place is more than just gimmicks, it's microbrews were delicious and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went there with two other couples on weekend getaway.Service was awesome food came in reasonable time.Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I've been to Church Brew Works several times and will say it was very impressive on my first visit. However, each visit after I was less and less satisfied. First of all, it is a spectacle to see. The Church itself and stain glass decor is beautiful. The brewing equipment on display at the alter is in plain view and for anyone into brewing it is fun to look at. I mean, they turned a Church into a brewery!  If you are even remotely curious, I suggest you at least go for a drink and look around.  Speaking of drinks, that was my main draw as my love for craft beer put a big bullseye on this destination. The first visit I did a flight which had their standard 6 or 7 beers like Pious Monk and Thunder Hop along with a rotating tap or 2. I believe the flight had 8 decent size samples for $13 or so. Now that first visit was great and I took all of the beers in. After a few more visits I can say that only the Pious Monk and Thunder Hop are memorable.  The rotating tap is usually decent but the rest is not very good for my tastes. I enjoy IPAs and full body beers. These to me lack flavor and just come off as average domestics.  No complexity and watered down.  If I go back I will stick with what I know I like and see what the rotating tap is. You can get growlers to go for a very reasonable price which I've done before.  One nice summer day I was in and sat on the patio which is very nice and enclosed with flag decor. I ordered a Dark N' Stormy (dark rum and ginger beer over ice with lime) and I must say it is the best thing I have ever had at Church Brew Works!  And the best Dark N' Stormy I've had anywhere. I don't know what they do but they should keep doing it.  The food much like the seating is split into two distinct categories. Pub side and Dinner side. Pub is more traditional bar foods and is cheaper where Dinner is more upscale and a jump in price. I generally go for Pub side seating on the left (dinner to the right) along with that menu since it's usually a quick stop for drinks. I've had dinner as well but in my opinion it is all small portioned and very bland though the presentation looks very nice.  The last few times I've gone I have skipped food all together.  I should also mention that they have oven baked pizzas but again, small and bland. But they look nice.  I'm just not impressed by the food options verse price compared to other breweries I've been to.    The service has always been top notch and friendly. The place is clean and huge so there is hardly ever a wait unless you have a big group. It is definitely somewhere you should check out for yourself and make a decision. Worthy of a trip just to say you've been there and see the spectacle but there are better brewery choices in the area."}
{"text":"Service was great, beer great, atmosphere was amazing! Food was not good. I had mussels and the sauce they came in tasted really odd. I would've eaten half of it and just left it alone but I couldn't even eat 2 . The server was very nice and took it back and got me something else. I got the pulled pork which  was just ok, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and decent local craft beer. I had the Cherry Wheat and the ThunderHop IPA which was my favorite out of the two. I hear there pizza is good, but I was traveling solo for business and was not up to the challenge of eating the entire 14\" pizza.   One down side, there wifi connection was weak and went out several times over the two hours I was there."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend and had a great time. I ordered a flight of beer and really enjoyed the cucumber beer. We also ordered some nachos and pierogies."}
{"text":"Good stuff first:  the interior is beautiful and they reused a lot of the old church in the restaurant/bar.  There is so much to see, it's almost like a museum.  I could wander around in there for hours.  The idea of it is great, but....  I thought the prices were high for what is just spruced up bar food.  Most of the menu was greasy and fried foods.  The service wasn't outstanding or helpful either.    Parking was great.  Free and right behind the building with a short walk around to the front of the building.  Realistically, this is a great place to go once or for just a beer.  I don't think I'd go for a meal again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Pittsburgh.  The beer is awesome and where else in the city can you get a good bison burger.  Oh yeah...it is housed in an old Catholic church which gives it a great atmosphere.  If you're in the 'Burgh, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"i was brought up catholic, so it almost seemed sacrilegious for me to be guzzling  beer in a former spiritual sanctuary.  however, i thought the beer was good (the hef was my fave) and the interior is impressive. definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"Unique setting with a pretty darn good menu. I had the Pittsburgh Farmhouse salad and it came topped with fries! My colleague had the pork nachos and rattlesnake pierogis. She shared her nachos with me and they were great. She said the pierogis were so so. We shared a beer flight. Wish it had come labeled because trying to remember 8 beer names was difficult. The building itself is gorgeous. Definitely would recommend it.   Note: not sure if this place has a handicap accessible restroom. The one I used was not."}
{"text":"Pierogi pizza is amazing!!!! They ran out of traditional pierogis which was a total bummer but then we saw the pizza. It was more satisfying than pierogis on a cold rainy night. The red leaf side salad was tasty but over dressed and didn't come with the blue cheese the menu promised. The special pierogis of the night were not amazing because the butter added in unwelcome sweet flavor to the jalapeño, cheddar bacon yumminess. The beer was great and the interior of the place is fun. A large brewing system sits on the alter and is  quite beautiful. The reason the place did not get 5 stars is because honestly out service sucked and the fact that they use styrofoam to go containers. The waiter did not greet us, tell us specials or attend to us. At one point when we were finished (napkins on plates) for a few minutes waiting for the check he was in the corner watching the game."}
{"text":"Give us this day, our daily BEER!  A brewery?  In a church?  This is MY kind of religion!  When we walked in, I was surprised by the decor.  They definitely remodeled, but they re-used a lot of original fixtures.  I was too excited to sit in a booth made from old pew benches.  There is no altar at the front of the church.  Brew tanks and other equipment take its place.  The aisle is just that.  An aisle, which divides the restaurant style seating and more casual high-top table bar seating.  We were here on a Saturday afternoon, and the menu showed several different brews.  Unfortunately, they were out of several drafts.  The menu became a little frustrating when we saw that they do sell their beers bottled, but only certain varieties.  They do sell their beers in growlers, but only in certain varieties, some of which they were out of.  So we both started with the Cherry Wheat and ordered a dessert to share (banana bread with peanut butter ice cream).  I really liked this beer, although it was the only one I tried.  We both finished our beers and ordered a second round of drinks.  We asked about our dessert, but the waitress said she thought we said we \"didn't\" want it.  Oops, okay, it'll just be a few minutes.  My Mango Sangria kept me occupied and happy while I waited.  Perhaps the most surprising thing about Church Brew Works is that they have a cocktail menu AND the cocktails are really damn good.  A lot of time passed before we got our dessert.  We had to ask about it at least twice.  Apparently, the kitchen hadn't prepped it for the day yet, and some other chaotic goings on.  The waitress apologized profusely, and then the manager stopped by our table to apologize and inform us that we would not be charged for the dessert.  The service at CBW is great, even if there are snags like low beer inventory and missing desserts.    We did not try anything off of the food menu, but there was a large party at a table nearby that appeared to be really enjoying themselves.  I would definitely visit again if I were in Pittsburgh, and I'd recommend it to all of my beer & travel loving friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love that place! We used to live in Pittsburgh. Now whenever we visit pittsburgh we have to go there! Great place, fantastic pizza and tasty beer!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for a meal. The building is absolutely beautiful. The food was good. I only tried the traditional perogies and a regular pepperoni pizza. The pizza was delicious but I wasn't a big fan of the perogies. They were a little to bland for me."}
{"text":"Beer in Church - a bit sacrilegious and I'm not even a religious man....   J/K  That whole novelty wore off quickly....  Beer was decent - Food (had a philly steak) was plain BAD.   Better question is - how do you really screw up a steak sandwich?   Wife had a fish sandwich that I think had to be in their freezer since the day the place opened.   Hummus was actually decent and they served it with fresh flat-bread.    Just another sub-par Pittsburgh restaurant.    I will say that the Pizza that made its way past our table looked and smelled delicious - if i do go back, I would head straight for that!   I would also say that the dinner menu was a bit on the $$$$ side for food that could not hold up to your better dining experiences.  Proceed with caution!"}
{"text":"loved seeing the gardens on the way into eat.. loved the building.. food was great.. our waiter was awesome and so was my Moscow mule and the buffalo chicken ravioli and the tiramisu for desert.. would go back.. a little pricy but was paying for my daughter.. which we got appetizer and deserts.. and a drink so I should say average price."}
{"text":"We were in town for a Pens game, and decided to come here afterward for some dinner. A friend of mine is a Carnegie Mellon grad, and suggested we hit this place while we were in town.   As a recovering Catholic and beer lover, I LOVED everything about the venue. They left so much of the old church intact, from the holy water fonts to the stained glass to the light fixtures, and even used pews as the benches. The brewing equipment (well, some of it, anyway) was up in the altar area. Some people might see that as sacrilegious, but i thought it was fantastic.  I'll be honest, I wasn't thrilled with the trippel I ordered (it was a little too sweet and bubbly), but my friend's stout was really good. I brought a six pack of the dunkel home for my boyfriend, who is a brewer himself, and he likes it.  For dinner, my friend had the pot pie, which I tried and loved, and I had the crab cakes, which were also good.   Definitely check this place out if you're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit that we went at a rather obscure time-- 2ish on a Wednesday afternoon, so the crowd wasn't really \"hopping.\" I, by no means, would consider myself uber religious, but walking in and drinking beer in this old church felt a little...off-putting at first (and was then replaced with a tinge of awesome?). Beer and meal were OK. We had an order of pierogies for an appetizer, which was the highlight of my time there. The service was great. Overall, the experience was a C+-- I think I would be more inclined to try a new restaurant than come back, but certainly no one would have to twist my arm for a reappearance. I definitely think a fun crowd would make up for the shortcomings I found."}
{"text":"Pros:  1. The brewery is located in a gorgeous church. I mean, it is really really pretty. The novelty of eating & drinking in a church is pretty great.   2. The brews served up are so delicious they could make a monk cry. If you love a good local brewery with a consistently good reputation, church brew works is a shining star. Fortunately, the brews are bottled & you can buy them around town in cases & six packs. I have drank multiple sampler cases of all their various ales, ipas, ambers and stouts, and loved every single one of them - that's saying a lot. I can be particularly hateful about subpar beer.   Cons;  1. The wait staff appears to be trained in assholism, to a degree that I have often been discouraged from going here. Too many times I have left swearing never to return for the abuse & neglect. Once I sprained my ankle here on some slippery stairs. Instead of offering me an apology and a bag of ice, as a decent person might, or offering a number of their lawyer in the event of a personal injury liability claim, the waiter was a complete dick & tried to up-sell me on an expensive bourbon shot, \"for the pain.\"   2. Some of the food is mediocre, but none of it is a good value. I am a person who loves garlic, but you have to wonder why you can't taste any other flavors in so many of their dishes. The food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag. They have a tempting \"pierogie of the day\" dish -- don't fall for it, it is disgusting 99% of the time. If you have to eat here, try one of the pizzas. Vegetarians have limited choices here. Vegans will starve.   3. Church Brew Works brings in people who would otherwise never venture to Lawrenceville, and gives them a totally mistaken impression of the neighborhood. This is not a place where you befriend folks at the next table. The majority of people here are not like you. And you should be happy you are not like them.     Despite all this, it is a really really pretty church! Good place to impress parents & in-laws from out of town. Office ladies who live in the suburbs will eat this up. Your wait staff is likely to deserve less than a 10% tip, but if you are like me, you will be guilted into leaving at least 15% because the universal good tip karma requires that you pay it forward."}
{"text":"Go for the ambiance and the beer. If this place had better food, it would earn that 5th star. don't get me wrong, the food is decent (especially the personal pizzas), but it's nothing special.   What is special, like the other reviewers point out, is the venue. Set in a former church, the owners were wise in leaving the stained glass in place and in turning the alter into the location of a micro-brewery. And the brew is definitely worth it. They have a selection of staples that are all quite tasty and also rotate some seasonals in. I forget the one I tried, but it was delicious...and I'm not even a big beer drinking.  If you're swinging through Pittsburgh, give this place a try. It's pretty special."}
{"text":"This place is so quirky it's great. Pittsburgh is lush with old churches and buildings. It's so sad that many are run down but I'm glad this one has been re purposed into a brewery. The local craft brews here are very tasty. I recommend the lagers, they are light and compliment the meal very well. I ordered the buffalo chicken pierogies and they are exactly as they sound! So good! Not too hot but they are def worth it. Once you are done eating be sure to walk around the church/brewery. There are lots of cool pictures to be had of all the fermenters up near all the stained glass art of Jesus. The one down side to this place is it gets kinda touristy."}
{"text":"Great space, have seen this church brewery concept done in other cities. Beer is great, but they should try to put more love into the food. Overall, the food choices and flavor were very mediocre, comparable to that of a chain like Applebees."}
{"text":"My friend raved about this church-converted-to-restaurant when she visited Pittsburgh, and it sounded interesting enough that we came here on our first visit of Steel City.  It was amusing to walk into the 'church' to find the microbrewery situated on the altar, the pews converted to seats for dining, religious-esque stained glass windows, and national flags hung below the organ.  We arrived there on a Saturday evening with no trouble getting a table indoors (they have a patio outside as well).  Service was fast.  I had the \"Pious Monk Dunkel\" that was pretty easy to drink for a dark beer.  My company had the \"Coconut Stout.  While I'm not a big fan of stout, that one was somewhat easy to drink.  We shared the watermelon cerviche, which was somewhat bland and not the best quality seafood used, but then I had the brown sugar glazed salmon with spinach and sweet potato mash that was pretty decent.  This place is known for their pierogies, so we also got that.  It was good but maybe a tad too much cream and butter.  Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.  Out-of-towners should certainly give this place a go."}
{"text":"Despite the disaster that was my break up with my ex last summer, I still keep coming back to the place we first met in person- CBW! I ridiculously love their Thunderhop IPA and it is always my go-to beer if none of the seasonal varieties peak my interest. I'm not a fan of the Celestial Gold but my (new-er) bf, who is not much of a beer drinker and prefers wine or mixed drinks, enjoyed it and said it's \"perfect for non-beer drinkers\". Since I last reviewed any of the menu options, I have sampled a lot, hence the need for an update!  As far as apps go, the Spinach, feta, and smoked gouda dip is  great for sharing and has that oozy, cheesy \"comfort\" taste to it. This is always a winner in my book, particularly because gouda and feta are my two favorite types of cheeses. The chips are, well, just chips. Maybe warmed pita bread would be a tastier substitution to the chips in the future. The bruschetta is also a solid appetizer to share. The ratio of toppings to bread (which usually annoys me when ordering bruschetta because I constantly feel like I'm left with either a lot of topping and no crostinis or the exact opposite) is perfect!  In addition to the wild boar BBQ pizza (which will always be my favorite pie at CBW), I've also had the pleasure of enjoying the Artichoke, spinach, and feta pizza and the chicken and sundried tomato pizza. Both were very flavorful and served pipping hot right out of the oven. The ingredients were very fresh and evenly distributed throughout the pie. The sundried tomato pizza I enjoyed actually was \"on the house\" because the bartender (such a quirky guy but well-meaning) clearly forgot to ring in the order (the big clue was when it had been 25 minutes and he asked what we had ordered again). Being the pizzas here are a bit on the pricey end, I greatly appreciated this generosity particularly considering the inconvenience as well.  I've also had the opportunity to sample some of their sandwiches, and I was pretty impressed with those as well! I've tried the Buffalo burger, the chicken and brie sandwich, and the pulled pork sandwich. The buffalo burger, cooked to a perfect MR, was so flavorful in it's natural juices that I did not use any condiments or have any add ons (like bacon or sauteed mushrooms or onions-perhaps next time since all of a sudden that sounds amazingly delicious!) With the chicken and brie sandwich, I loved how the brie complimented the granny smith apple slices on the sandwich! It was cheesy yet not overly so-very delicious! The pulled pork sandwich was very tasty too-particularly the BBQ sauce which I believe to be the same used on the Wild boar BBQ pizza! And just a general statement on the atmosphere-pretty freakin' awesome! How many people can say they have drank beer in a decommissioned Catholic Church?! For that fact alone, you should take my word and check out CBW for yourself!"}
{"text":"In 2014 this place was amazing. The pizza blew my mind, the atmosphere was beautiful, and the beer was tasty. In 2017 my experience has been very different. The atmosphere is still beautiful and unconventional, but the food has tanked. I ordered nachos that turned out to be kind of cold and sad. My brother got a cold cheesesteak that he described as his least favorite cheesesteak he has ever tasted. The beer is mediocre and tastes metallic to me. The staff is still friendly, but I will sadly no longer recommend Churchbrew to visitors anymore. It seems as if it has turned into a touristy stop and they no longer care about food quality."}
{"text":"Ambience was amazing. We were seated quickly on a Saturday night. Food however very disappointing. The \"Belgium\" fries were soggy and pizza was cold and doughy.  We spoke to manager and he didn't seem to care.  Come for the beer and atmosphere but not the food."}
{"text":"Q: How do you get this guy into a church? A: Serve beer and ensure that there will be no pedophile priests. Zing?  Beer replaces holy water. Meat replaces that one Jesus guy's body. Bartenders and servers replace alter boys. Brewing equipment replaces the alter. Tipsiness replaces enlightenment. I have more.  Walking in, I could not help but feel like I was in the presence of something holy. By holy, I mean holy shit, beer. We had a flight of seven 5 oz beers, most of which were pretty goddamn good. Although CBW's beer is nothing to necessarily start a religious holy-war over, I can't complain. Their rauchbier, Belgian IPA, and Belgian tripel were good enough for me to want to drink them post-resurrection. Their mint stout was a bit of a miss, but I cannot judge them for their sins. Call me a heretic if you must. But dear lord, the bison delmonico, tenderloin medalions, seared sesame tuna with cabbage, and bananas foster bread pudding made me want to convert to eat here all the time, but alas, I do not live anywhere near this fine establishment, nor state. Oh, and our waiter was great. By the end of the meal I felt like he was the Joseph to my Jesus.  If ever you immaculately conceive the idea to get some beers and require the body of a dead animal in your stomach, go to Church. Halleluiah. Jesus serves."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. great food. great selection. good beers brewed in house. polite engaging staff. I have never had a negative experience here."}
{"text":"Cheap beer, neat setting, lots of seating but fairly quiet on a Saturday night around 11pm...I was pretty hyped in coming to this place but the vibe there was just too quiet and they didn't really have a lot of beer selection, altho they did have their own brewery in the background"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Church Brew Works in Pittsburgh, then you are missing out. The restaurant, as its name states, was once a church. I never saw the church in action, but I assume that it was a beautiful space because it is now. The large cauldrons where the beer is brewed is in the pulpit making for a spectacular scene. The booth-style tables incorporate pews so you feel as if you are at the last supper. Yes, Jesus is in the air.   I ended up getting the Black Bean Hummus and Zucchini Pasta with vegetables. The hummus was very good, but the pita bread was very oily. The pasta dish was beautifully presented and tasty.   I will certainly be back here if only for a drink; but, will end up having dinner as well.   The service was also excellent I failed to mention."}
{"text":"Beer selection is great obviously and the environment is like nothing else, but when it comes down to it, the food disappoints."}
{"text":"The food and the beer are both above average.  There are better places in Pittsburgh for both, but Church Brew Works is well worth the trip if only for the ambience and experience of eating in a converted church.  And the food and beer is good enough that I have found myself here many times."}
{"text":"Don't drink, so I wasn't expecting to like this place. Was pleasantly surprised! Beautiful architecture and didn't smell like a frat house-yes, it smelled like beer, but it was very subtle and pleasant. My boyfriend and I shared a bruschetta appetizer, which was alright-it had pesto, tomatoes, cream cheese-but was a little bland. My main course, the buffalo pierogi sauté, was fantastic! Creamy, delicious. Not nutritious, of course! But awesome. My friends enjoyed their drinks and my boyfriend sampled a few beers, which were decently sized and everyone could try them!  Unfortunately, the service wasn't the best. We had a server named Andrew, who was pretty decent, but we had to tell him at least 2 of 3 times to get us water, to get other orders. My friend had a coupon for a free pint glass through an app of hers, and we told him at the end of the meal, 20 minutes passed, and I went to get him. He'd completely forgotten. Besides him, this was a wonderful experience and I'd love to come again!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and usually everything is good.  Last night was the first time I had something I didn't like. The \"Pittsburgh Steak Sandwich\" I didn't like it at all and I love cheese steak sandwiches. The onion soup was great and so was the pizza."}
{"text":"You think its just a novelty having a restaurant and brewery in an old church, but its actually pretty great. Really good food and fresh brewed beer."}
{"text":"The service, food, and sadly, the beer were just mediocre. I waited a long time to get my beer and my food came out cold.   I would go back solely because of the concept and the atmosphere with lower expectations."}
{"text":"Good beer and a lot of options. I tried their 20th anniversary something (forgot the exact name) - it was pretty good. Nice staff !"}
{"text":"This is definitely a must see brewery! I don't know the genius who thought it would be a good idea to use an old church as a brewery but it works! The inside is incredibly impressive; beautiful stained glass, high ceilings and great wood work. Plus the bathrooms are nicer than any brewery you will ever go to haha. We didn't order food but everything that walked passed us looked good and I've heard nothing but good things from friends who have tried their food. A lot of people seem to like the pizzas! I tried the tasting menu for their brews, which is a great deal at $18. I will be back for another round of beers and hopefully some food!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. Our party of five ate on the pub side since there was a longer wait for the fancy side. We feasted on puffy pierogies, meaty wings and such fantastic pizza. For a drink, I had a soda (I believe it was brewed there) with vodka which was a good choice for me since I don't drink beer. This place is a bit pricey, but you've got to think about the costs that you rack up when you set up shop IN A CHURCH! Super Holy Hell, I will definitely come back to this place the next time I'm in PGH! I was actually bummed that Zachary wasn't with me because this place would have blown him away!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit just to have the experience of drinking beer in an old converted Catholic Church.  They brew the beer right up on the alter and the seats at the tables are made from the original pews!  As someone who grew up going to Catholic Church it was definitely a disconcerting experience at first to go into what looks like a Church to drink beer.  They brew their own beer and have several options you can try and you can get a sampler to try them all.  Their beer is good but not amazing.  The food is also good and they try to be really creative with things sometimes.  For example, last time I went I had rattlesnake and cactus pierogies which were on special!  That was my first time having rattlesnake and it was pretty tasty.  Their menu is a pretty eclectic assortment of things from Cajun to Italian (pizza, pasta) to traditional Pittsburgh items.  But it is a little on the pricey side for the quality of what you get.  Some of the portions are larger than others."}
{"text":"Love the Brewworks, especially their pizza, their pierogies and their watercress salad with salmon. Oh, and the beer. Thumbs up!! My only suggestion is that they improve the lighting in their courtyard to something more subtle. There's just too much glare at the moment."}
{"text":"Good, more than decent lunch/sandwich bar food food, great beer.  But the atmosphere is absolutely 5 stars of wonderful.  The church is spectacular, and the patio is lovely too.  Seeing hops growing on the walls outside really makes a point.  This place does beer well.  And the site itself is just wonderful."}
{"text":"I took some out of town friends to Church Brew Works for dinner.  I would have given 5 stars, but we really wanted to order pizza but were informed that there was over an hour wait for pizza. So, I went with the Tuscan Cheesteak with fries instead.  It was pretty delicious.  I didn't know what beer to get, so I ordered the beer flight.  Definitely worth a try.  My out of town guests LOVED the place and raved about it for days afterward. Overall, I thought it was a great place."}
{"text":"It's sacril-icious."}
{"text":"\"When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie\" the pizzas son delicioso!  The crust has a soft inside but a crispy outside. By far the best pizza I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Sad to see this place go downhill. The beer is the only thing still awesome about this place. The last two times I've been here, I've had horrible service AND not so great food. I ordered a chicken cheese steak expecting a large, cheesey sandwich (I was very hungry) and I got a giant bun with the tiniest amount of filling. I was so disappointed. I used to love this place because of the novelty and atmosphere but I can't say I'll go back anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Our server was excellent. He was well informed about beer and menu, and everything came out promptly without ever feeling rushed. Try the buffalo meatloaf or shrimp and grits.... But are delicious. If beer isn't your thing, get the mule in a copper mug!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites.    The beers here are some of the best around.  The Church itself is very cool.    Get one of the Pizza's, I really like them.  Beware that the beers are on the strong side.  Might want to take a taxi of you plan on drinking a lot.  Service is usually adequate, not stellar.  Prices are in line with other places of similar type.  Parking lot a bit small."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple beers and appetizers a few weeks ago with my family. We all tried a different beer (I cannot remember names) and we all enjoyed each one. No one had a complaint.   We ordered the pierogies and my dad got the jambalaya. The pierogies were cooked in butter with some onions and served with sour cream on the side. They were browned nicely and had good flavor. They lacked some seasoning. The jambalaya was good, I'd order it again in the future.   The service was awesome, our waitress continuously checked in on us. She knew all the specials and every question we asked she could answer. I wish I could remember her name because she was great!"}
{"text":"We were wandering around when suddenly, the skies opened up and the rains came down. But I looked back and there it was---the Church, calling to me.  We went inside and as others have stated, it's a beautiful place. A few things that brought down the rating for us: (1) They were out of a bunch of stuff and the stuff they had was just all right. (2) We didn't want to eat a real meal and the bar food we got was just okay. More like MEH. I would be willing to return with more/better stuff on tap and possibly to try a real meal.  Our bartender was pretty good. The prices were GREAT. I'll teeter between 3-3.5 stars and if I ever returned, I'd give a real go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Had been here years ago. Hasn't changed. Just as good as I remember. It's an old church (built 1903) that was converted into a brew pub. Wide variety of craft beer styles and solid food choices from sandwiches and wood fire pizza to full entree. I had the Celestial Gold beer, an appetizer of pierogis (amazing if your a pierogi fan and I am) and a pulled pork sandwich with a beer based BBQ sauce. The atmosphere is fun. Old stained glass, beer vats among organ pipes. Pews that are used to create the booth seating. A unique place with great food and craft beer!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great atmosphere. Great beer. Okay, the food is good or very good, not great, but the pizza - Great. I never believed I would like a pizza with cheese and sauce only. No other toppings. Very strange for me, but I LOVE it here. The crust is exceptional. And remember, the other food is very good, also. Don't forget the outdoor dining area and the gorgeous bar. The wait staff has always been very friendly and helpful. All first time visitors should try the sampling of beers."}
{"text":"A gorgeous building and atmosphere provides a unique dining/drinking experience.  I had the Buffalo and Wild Mushroom meatloaf last night. Maybe the nature of the beast, but I found it quite dry and not my idea of what the consistency of meatloaf should be. Chocolate cake dessert was very good. I also had their self-brewed non-alcoholic Birch Beer which was good (kind of like root beer).  You would think that a church would be designed to maximize sound traversal, but somehow this church seems to deaden sound such that you can maintain local conversation even when busy."}
{"text":"Great for beer. Great for the atmosphere. The food is average. Someplace to bring out of town guests. The church is beautiful. Fun to experience every so often, but not somewhere I'd go all the time."}
{"text":"I had some of the best cheese pizza of my life here. The garlic level of the pizza was absolutely perfect. There was soooo much garlic, but still not too much! The beer was also delicious and the ambience was super cool. It has a similar feel to haufbrauhaus without the kitschiness."}
{"text":"I love Church Brew Works! As a native morgantowner, everytime we have guests from out of town, we feel the need to do a Pittsburgh day and inevitably end up here. Of course it has the coolness factor of being a converter church, but the food is pretty tasty too.   I suggest with going with one of the pizzas. They are large enough for 3 to share (10 slices - I think) and our favourite is the mushroom. Of course, they also have an amazing beer selection. If you can't decide (which I never can) try the beer sampler. Its HUGE (I think its like 8 sample as opposed to your usual five). My favourite out of the lot was the Christmas blend, which was gingery but not sweet.  Dont forget to take selfies of the giant stainless steel vats of beer at the \"altar\"."}
{"text":"I love the setting and I understand how it can be intimidating for religious people. I am Christian but I am  not a Puritan. Church is a building and if you use it  for beer obviously is not a church and it becomes a brewery.   They have great variety of beers and good food.  I had the pious monk dunkel with 5,5% and my husband the  had lost love stout. We are big funs of dark beers.  The service was excellent and the place is really big."}
{"text":"Great brewery/restaurant setting in an old Church!! Awesome surrounding, awesome food, and great beer!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place for the atmosphere but past that I expect to get what I pay for. I like the beers here and the food. But come on who pays $12 for nachos with barely any meat or toppings. Didn't even get that much chips amd still didn't has be enough toppings to really enjoy them."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and clean. The beer, my hubby and I got was delicious. But the glasses were so small and over priced.  The customer service was okay. Hence the 3 stars. I would recommend coming though for the experience."}
{"text":"Oh no.....this is now a fallen angel of a formerly heavenly restaurant.  Seraphim and cherubim must be weeping....what happened?!   This has always been my go-to spot for out of town friends....and was again last night.  Alas, it will be no more.  Service was spotty, the food was extremely disappointing....even the drinks were off.  Let me 'splain.  The Moscow Mule I confidently ordered wasn't even a glimmer of what one SHOULD be...not even a sprig of mint, let alone muddled mint.  Sigh.  Tasted like vodka (well, you couldn't actually taste it, WEAK drink!) and tonic with a sliver of lime....sheesh.  Where was the ginger beer?  They even make their own ginger beer...or maybe they don't anymore.  The Pittsburgh salad?  Come on.....the fries on top were fine, but the rubbery, melted mess of cheese covering SPROUTS (dear Lord, sprouts on a Pittsburgh salad?  Mon Dieu!).  The grilled shrimp were more like previously cooked, warmed up rubbery (again with the rubbery) things.    At my recommendation, my companion had the buffalo meatloaf which was dried out on top of dry mashed potatoes.  I used to CRAVE the buffalo meatloaf, dream about the moist, mushroomy wonders of it.  No more.  Even the bread was just boring sliced Italian....what happened to the wonderful multi-grain bread they used to make?    Apparently thiere is new management or a new kitchen staff.  Please, bring back the former glory that the angels used to spread their wings and sing over....until I see that sight over Lawrenceville, I won't be back.  So sad."}
{"text":"How does a restaurant close for a private event? I will never go to Church Brew Works ever and will tell everyone I meet in Pittsburgh to never go there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but average food.  Coupled with the less than stellar neighborhood and this was a once and done for me."}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner the Brew Works had been recommended by several others as a place to check out while in Pittsburgh. I really like visiting breweries, and I love food and old buildings, so what's not to like? We stopped in just for a beer, as we had eaten earlier and didn't have a lot of time. The venue is breathtaking; it's worth it to come here just to enjoy the space and the stain glass windows. Definite plus that this old church was saved from demolition. I didn't order any food, but based on those around me it appeared that the prices might be a little high for what they offered. I had a stout, which was pretty good, and my partner had the doppelbock, which we agreed was just okay. There were no prices for the drinks on the menu (which drives me crazy) and the chalkboard menus behind the bar were too high to fully read. I think if we could have seen the IBUs on the menu for the doppelbock then it wouldn't have been our first choice, since we are not hopheads. They don't have many of their beers available in bottles or cans, so we settled on their Celestial Gold as a gift/souvenier for my parents.   I'm definitely glad that I visited this place, and I think that it's worth the time if you're in the area. Now that I've seen it though, I don't have a huge desire to return. I think it would be neat if they played up the church atmosphere- some old choral music playing over the speakers instead of classic rock, but maybe that's just me. I will say this; it's great to see those brewing tanks up on the alter where they belong!"}
{"text":"Incredible venue for taking our guests visiting from out of town -- church turned brewery/restaurant.  Parking lot in back and on-street parking available.  Nice selection of brews plus other libations if you, as I, are not into beer.  Menu is very unique -- ostrich/boar/pizza/chili/pierogies  among the offerings.  I selected the pierogies with tomatoes and broccoli.  Definitely satisfied my taste buds.    Bass and accordion players played and sang \"Happy Birthday\" to several patrons, while toasting their beers, as well.  It's a lively place that definitely still has the looks of a church with organ, stained glass windows, and pews abounding.  Bottom line -- it's fun and tasty.  P.S.  As of this post, scan QR code from table sign, sign up for email and get free glass. Sweet!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the atmosphere, 3 stars for the food. The food wasn't bad, but it just wasn't great either. I want to echo what many other views say about this place just trying too hard to do too much. The menu was alllll over the place, seemed like they were trying to touch every type of cuisine.   They need to find their vision with food, hopefully it'll be simplified!   The openness of the bar is amazing, I wish more old churches would be be converted into places like this!"}
{"text":"Truly bad food.  I hear the pizza might be edible.  Atmosphere is cool, though, no kidding.  Maybe go for beers."}
{"text":"A brewery in a church?  Interesting and unique for sure. I first heard about this place two years ago during my residency interviews.  Two years later I made the visit, on my first night of what will be at least four years in Pittsburgh.  So how did my first visit go?  Food (5.0/10) = Before I moved here, I did some research on foods unique to Pittsburgh.  One of the items that kept popping up were the pierogis.  As such, I was excited to order pierogis as my first dish in this city.  So what exactly did I get.  Hmmm.  I saw four pillow-like objects that looked like Chinese dumplings, but a little larger.  They sat in a pool of butter, and topped with a big ass dollop of sour cream.  Hmm, ok....so now to find out what juiciness awaits on the inside.  Mashed potatos?  Wait a second...what the hell is this? A blob of fat laying on top of carbs stuffed with more carbs, all swimming in a pool of fat?  My attention was then redirected to my friend who had just ordered the pierogi pizza.  Using my imagination, I visualized a thick crust pie with chunks of dough and mashed potatoes as toppings.  I was almost correct.  It was essentially a mashed potato pizza.  Now this concept is great if executed properly.  In fact, a pizza joint in New Haven, CT called Bar pretty much perfected this (Bacon, mashed potato thin crust pizza).  However, the pierogi pizza fell flat.  Just carbs on more carbs.    I also ordered what I thought would be a turkey breast sandwich.  I received grocery store deli turkey meat (the slimy processed kind that swims in sodium nitrite preservative inside a plastic container) in between two dry pieces of bread.  And this sandwich costs $9-10?  Where's the actual real turkey breast I thought I paid for?  Needless to say, the food was a big disappointment.    The only thing that I can say positive things about is the beer.  Great beer selection.  Hell, it's a \"brewery,\" so better get the beer right, right?  Ambiance (8.0/10) = Certainly a unique set up.  Beer everywhere. Stained glass.  You can pray to the beer gods here.  Service (8.0/10) = Our waitress was great.  Allowed me to sample several of their beers before selecting one.   Was attentive.  Overall Opinion = A cool place to check out at least once.  Beer is good.  Food is meh.  $9-10 for a crappy sandwich worth about $1,...hell no.  No amen to that abomination."}
{"text":"We had a nice time here with friends last weekend. Food was decent and they had a nice variety on the menu. We had the non-traditional perogies and buffalo cauliflower for appetizers. My meal was a Farro salad and hubs had the lettuce wraps. My girlfriend had the lamb meatballs which she loved and her husband had the perogie sauté. Everybody was happy with their food. The vast beer menu was lost on me just because I'm not a beer drinker. The guys really liked theirs tho. I prefer a cocktail but I wasn't impressed by the Moscow Mule I ordered. My friend liked it so I passed it over and switched to a Tanquerey and Tonic which was made just right. This wouldn't go down on my list of favorites but it was solid and an interesting setting."}
{"text":"Drink of this beer, for it is my blood. Eat of these pierogies, for it is my body. Do this in remembrance of me.  AMEN.  In the land of Pittsburgh sits a beautiful church that was decommissioned and tanks of beer were placed at the altar to be exalted.  Thank you baby jesus!  Church Brew Works & Restaurant is an amazing place. I suggest checking out the website to really see what this place looks like.  It is sorta like a beerhall inside and they have an outdoor courtyard in the back which is equally beauteous. They brew lots of yummy beer and the munchies are primarily German influenced.  Eating pierogies and drinking big glasses of beer was just like heaven. The only sin was this flavored creme brulee, which tasted burnt and just awful.  On the way out, friends and I saw a humongous slug on the landscaping retaining wall trailing a nice snotty line behind it."}
{"text":"Great beer!   Horrible food!   The pizza was the only redeemable food and they no longer serve due to a fire from the oven.    Take away a growler and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Omg I have been in Pittsburgh for 5 years and last time was my first time at this place. Yes it is a church but the set up is really nice especially for accommodating big groups. The Long Island and dragon spirit are both very tasty and the carribean wrap, spinach dip, and shrimp entree are yummy and our service was awesome. Very intriguing place or shall I say brewery in an historic church."}
{"text":"We had an amazingly fun time at this architecturally pleasing venue. It was packed, but we were seated right away. The waiter was very helpful in answering all of our questions, and our food came hot and delish!  I had a bowl of French Onion soup that was savory with just the right amount of melted cheese on top! Next, was the bison burger that was cooked to medium perfection. So much to see and the place was hopping with families and couples. Great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really cool its in a old church. I had a burger and my friend had pizza. There food was really good. There beer was good too. I would definitely go back here. The customer service was great. It can be a little pricey but its definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"RJ and I came here specifically for the poutine, only to be told they took it off the menu a few months ago.  We were here the day of the Flyers/Penguins stadium series, and were told 45 minute wait but it only took 1/2 hour to be seated. Our server told us we just missed the huge crowd and came at a good time. We had high hopes, except we hardly saw him and he didn't check back to see what we needed. We didn't have silverware, plates, or the water we asked for. We sat so long waiting for our order, another server told us she would bring menus and take our order. I ordered rum, pineapple and grenadine which was great (some bartenders make it terrible) and only cost $5. RJ ordered rattlesnake pierogies which had good flavor except for the rattlesnake part. He liked them, but I thought the texture was gross, like a stringy refried bean. I had bison meatloaf which was fantastic. It was very juicy, I was afraid it would be dry. The potatoes and zucchini were cooked perfectly. RJ had roasted lamb which was full of fat, and very disappointing especially for the $30 price tag. The location in an old church is interesting, but doesn't make up for mediocre service or overpriced lamb that shouldn't be served with all that fat."}
{"text":"Best mussel sauce ever! Dunkel beer, garlic, butter and mustard! Pretty great! No pic! Was hungry!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer ... and in a church.    Loved this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  A little disappointed they took the pizza oven out of the pulpit, but their pizza is very good.  Friends were disappointed that flights were preselected only."}
{"text":"This is a great place for bar food and some beer on tap. The menu doesn't have any healthy options so you are stuck ordering a cheese dip but its just that kind of place. Church Brew Works is a Pittsburgh favorite, especially among the tourists."}
{"text":"The beer was decent. Everything else was mediocre to awful. The first issue is that they only offer the dinner menu on Sunday so you're paying top dollar for a really disappointing meal. The single best plate of food served to our party of three was an a la carte grilled chicken breast and black bean salad we ordered for our infant. I ordered the seafood pasta. The sauce was flavorless, the shrimp was overcooked and the crab meat was loaded with fragments of shell. The service was similarly bad. Our waiter just didn't seem remotely interested. Pittsburg has many good and interesting restaurants. You don't need to pay ninety dollars for lunch. Almost anything would have been better."}
{"text":"What GREAT samplings you get on the beer flights! :) how can you beat a church for the perfect ambience to drink alcohol in? :) its hip, but still kept the traditional trappings of its religious past without the mass :) appetizer was awesome, a bruschetta that was definitely unique and paired well with he signature beers. I am impressed with beer selections for a micro brewery! The place is spacious (think mass church duh). Parking is accessible in the rear and the service was solid!"}
{"text":"This is a nice brewery in a cool, ornate, renovated old Catholic church.  We liked all of the beers we tried.  The stained glass is all still in place as are the Holy Water Fonts and pipe organ.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  It's a big place with a lot of seating and it is very popular.  There is a large, free parking lot behind the building which was once a Catholic school."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!   I must say I'm not big on beer so I wasn't very excited to go here for dinner.  Being new in town we were excited to try this place once we heard it used to be a church turned Brewery.    We sat at the bar and got the best service ever! Our bartender ( I don't remember her name but she was tall, skinny with straight blonde hair) was AMAZING!!! She happily pointed out some of her favorites and helped us guide our way through their menu.  We ordered their 5 cheese pizza and added Spinach and Pepperoni.  It was so good! I can't eat to much tomato sauce things so it was nice that it was a garlic and olive oil base.  We also ordered their side Caesar which had homemade dressing.  Yum Yum!  My partner ordered their beer sampler and I got the Moscow (Something...damn it I forgot the rest of the name.) But it was vodka, ginger beer and a little lime.  It was so good I'm going to try and make it at home.    All in all this place was yum yum good! And she even gave us some tips on places to go around town.    Great place, Great service and yum yum food!! I'm going to be back sooner than I'd like to admit!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit the Church Brew Works ever since seeing it featured on the Food Network show Outrageous Food. In that episode, they featured the restaurant's \"rattlesnake pierogies\" I was disappointed to find this was not a regular menu item, instead they offer either \"traditional\" or \"untraditional\" pierogies- on the night of our visit the untraditional ones were Bufflale Chicken style, and boy were they good! I still want to try those rattlesnake ones though...  I also had the onion soup and the bison meatloaf which were both delicious, especially the meatloaf. My spouse enjoyed the jambalaya which was nice and spicy. As to the beers, there was a decent selection of styles from lager to dunkel to belgian to stout....and our server accomodated our request to sample some of the brews before deciding. Our favorite of the night was the Thunderhop which had a wonderful hoppy flavor.   As to the ambiance- well I think it is well worth a trip if you are in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is a converted church complete with stained glass windows and wooden pews (ok they are not the most comfortable seats but it adds to the effect!) and where the alter would have been are the giant beer tanks.  We found the service to be very prompt and our server answered all our questions concerning beer and food.  I thought this restaurant was a good value for the money. Dinner for two was just under $70 before tip- and our meal included 4 pints of beer, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.   Visited August 2011"}
{"text":"Neat concept but lacking in execution.  Wait staff seemed disinterested.  He seemed to want to be anywhere but here.  The food was ok and the beer was towards the low end of what I would expect from a brew pub.  This is definately a place to check out once for the unique concept of a brew pub in a church but is not somewhere I would return for a second visit."}
{"text":"Great Pizza in the bar area. Beers are first rate and the fact that the kettles are behind the altar lend some religion to the whole process. A must visit restaurant."}
{"text":"Good service. Popular place, so there was a long wait. Good place to people watch. Good for families and groups. Nachos were soggy. Spinach dip was cold. Arancini was average. Southwest chicken wrap was also average. Good beer."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visits here. The interior is simply stunning and spectacular with the significant features of the original church (including the giant wooden doors), still intact despite its conversion to a brew pub. Brewing equipment is beautifully displayed in what was the alter area. Oews were replaced by tables, chairs, high tops, stools and a bar. The center aisle divides the traditional dining and bar areas. In contrast to the inside, the outside courtyard-style patio is subdued and relaxing on a nice evening. Service is always good, even for larger groups. I've found all of the food to be reliably decent and the specials are often a good call if something on that first page of the menu jumps out at you. Some beers are better than others and recently I found the cleverly named Pittsburgh Post Grissette to be a nice summery beer without having too much of a fruity taste. The fact that their website isn't updated with the current draft list is a little annoying though. A quinoa salad special proved to be awesome. A coconut chicken special featured delicious golden brown chicken, though the jalapeno couscous was disappointing as it didn't have even the slightest bit of kick and likewise the pineapple salsa was little more than tiny chunks of pineapple. The fact that they feature Dave & Andy's Homemade Ice Cream is a reason to always save room for dessert. Another disappointing thing on a recent visit is that we were looking forward to food with recently foraged Chantarelle mushrooms as the restaurant just sent out an email on the topic the day prior. There were no menu items that included this fungus, but our water was very helpful, looked into it and said that the kitchen was still doing a shrimp pasta that had a sauce with the Chantarelles in it. The dish was delicious, but lacked any taste of these seasonal shrooms."}
{"text":"Food is just as good as it was a few years back, but service is just terrible. If you want slow service this is the place to go. Used to be a regular here but no more!"}
{"text":"I wish I could post separate reviews for the beers and the experience. The beer is great. It's fresh. Based on the quality, I presume CBW is a craft brew pub. There is an interesting selection of rotating beers. I will definitely attempt to acquire more CBW beer in the future; unfortunately, I don't think it will be at this venue.  To start, it took about 10 minutes to get the attention of one of the bartenders. That's just too long especially when everyone is ordering just beer. Also, the bartender brought us the wrong beers. We ordered the belgian tripels, and he be brought us american barleywines. I should have noticed from the color and said something immediately, but I decided to give it a shot with the likely chance that I was wrong. Upon tasting, my suspicion was confirmed; however, I really enjoyed the style, so I didn't ask the bartender to correct it. I'm glad I tried something new, yet it shouldn't have happened this way.  The atmosphere is very similar to Hofbrauhaus'. It's very loud with a eclectic clientele; similar to Hofbrauhaus, there are many family casually dining. one big difference is that no one is dancing on their seat. I would also assert that folks here appear to be less drunk which I'd attribute to the smaller serving glasses. Also, there didn't seem to be a beer garden."}
{"text":"Yes, you've got cool decor and a cool building and you make your own beer, and it's good beer. But the (granted) one time I was there, and got a beer at the bar, the service mas miserable. The worst service I have ever gotten. We were met by a smarmy bartender who after pouring our beers proceeded to ignore my friend and I as we tried to flag him down to order another beer and then when this proved unsuccessful (a check had magically appeared in front of us) attempted for at least 15 minutes to flag him down so that we could pay and get the hell out of there. Not a fan. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place- it's great for dates, gatherings and family outings.  The beer is excellent and the food is exceptional, especially the vegetarian options.  Get the pierogi.  The old church is a total trip.  Make sure to go to the bathrooms while you're there!"}
{"text":"I took my wife there for our anniversary. We usually visit The Church Brew Works a couple times a year. The food and beer was always phenomenal every other time we visited. This time we went at about 4:00 PM on a Saturday. The restaurant was only about 2/3's full. The first thing we noticed was everything from the front doors, to the chandeliers, to the bathrooms, were very dusty, dirty and dingy. There were spider webs hanging from the ceiling in the dining room. We were almost afraid to eat there.       My wife's appetizer came out 10 minutes after mine and was over cooked. Our dinners were overall well below average for the price. Our favorite entrees were definitely not the same. The flavors were not what they were before and the portion size was too small.     The bar tender was drinking beer behind the bar which seemed very unprofessional. It seems like this restaurant is under new management and they have lost their good chefs. I think the owner needs to watch \"Bar Rescue\" on Spike, because this place is in trouble."}
{"text":"I love beer, craft beer to be specific. When I visited Pittsburgh I had to make a visit for top notch craft beer. Unfortunately did not have enough time to visit Fat Heads during my visit, but Church Brew filled my need for craft beer.  I loved the setting, some might think a church being converted into a brew house is wrong, but they really have done a nice job here. It is definitely a prettier setting for a brew house than I am used to.  The waitress we had was really nice and suggested that we go with a sampler since we were trying various beers. This was a great idea and let us sample all the draft beers they serve. I enjoyed all the beer I sampled, some more than others, but they were all tasty.  As a visitor to Pittsburgh unfortunately Church Brew Works is in what appears to be middle of nowhere, but it was well worth the cab fare."}
{"text":"bless me, yelp, for i have sinned.  it has been far too long since my last confession...  i confess that i wasn't that impressed with church brew works.  oh how i wanted to love it.  i mean, it's a brewery. in a catholic church. their brilliant and creative adaptive reuse of the building should earn them at least four stars (and you thought i was going to make some comment about my jaded catholic upbringing and how awesome it is to throw down in a church) ;)   so then, why the three stars? the service was less than... eh.   i listened to our waiter mumble out the description of the beers and specials like he was reading the sunday obituaries.  not a great start to the meal.  and the food was just... eh.  it's trying to be 'nice restaurant food', but all it is is glorified bar food at restaurant pricing.  and not necessarily good bar food at that.    so given the lack luster review, why would i ever go back... 1) it's close to my house, so i can bike home sloshed if need be  2) the beers are pretty tasty (especially the pious monk dunkel and the millennium trippel 3) like the good catholic i was raised, everyone deserves a second chance and lastly, 4) the real reason... i can now tell my mom and grandma that i went to church this week without a guilty conscience"}
{"text":"Definitely a hopping place when I visited, and it's coils to be able to eat and drink in a church.  I was told to go for the pizza but was told the oven burned down once I arrived.  Everything on the menu seemed pricey so we went with apps. The pierogi's we got were good but nothing too impressive given the price.  We sampled several different beers which were good but nothing that stood out as a beer I would want to buy and bring home. All in all decent but not so sure I'd go back given Pittsburgh's other options."}
{"text":"If you're in Pittsburgh, definitely put this place at the top of your to-do list!! It's amazing in every sense of the word. I mean, it's a brewery in a church... Does it get much cooler than that?   Myself and a couple of friends had a few hours to kill last Saturday, so we decided to stop by Church Brew Works. It is, by far, the best way to kill some time or have a delicious sit down meal.   Since we weren't really interested in ordering a meal, we decided just to sit at the bar. Immediately after sitting down, the bar tender handed us drink menus. I'll admit, I'm not the biggest fan of beer. (Sorry beer fans!) So I instead tried on of their February specials: Forbidden Fruit. It was a mix of champagne and pomegranate juice. It was delicious. I also tried the sangria... Best sangria I've ever had in my life! My friends and I decided to order a beer sampler. \"When in Rome...\" Right?! Like I said, I'm not the biggest beer fan, but I'm optimistic about trying new things. The sampler came with 8 beer samples, and the bar tender explained every single one of them to us in detail.   By that point, we were all feeling a little hungry so we decided to order some small appetizers. I ordered the bruschetta. Very, very tasty bruschetta. Maybe they could have chopped the cherry tomatoes a little smaller, but that's my personal preference. We also ordered some pierogis. If you come here, for the love of all things good and holy, ORDER THE PIEROGIS!!!! They were, by far, the best pierogis I've ever had in my life.   Needless to say, but my friends and I left with full stomachs and tastebuds fully satisfied. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Has a wide good selection. We got the alligator perogies and spaghetti squash,. Both were pretty good. Alligator perogies were mild tasting-- couldn't really taste the alligator but it was fun to try. Their stouts are very tasty. Overall, it's a unique place to experience!"}
{"text":"The idea is great-I love to see Catholic Churches transformed into breweries. The service was slow and mediocre. The food was terrible. The beer was potable at best. They need to re-evaluate their model."}
{"text":"Food is 3.5-to-4 stars. Pleasantly surprised by the non-meat offerings, including spaghetti made of zucchini with lentil and mushroom \"meatballs.\" But the ambiance and beer put this place into 5-star territory. An altar of brewing equipment? Amen! Great spot for tourists or infrequent visitors to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Left before ordering, was seated at a 2 top table next to a column right outside of the kitchen. When asked if there was anyplace else to sit was told no. Yet could see 2 other empty tables. Guess they don't want my business."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very unique. Very cool. Beer is average. My sesame tuna was good. The wife had jambalaya - good. My oldest ordered the ribs - excellent.  My youngest ordered the Wagyu steak - horrible. We must of missed the part on the menu where they add a cilantro pesto sauce to it. My family doesn't like Cilantro (too soapy tasting), but that wasn't even the issue. $34 and it was the toughest piece of medium-rare steak I've ever eaten. I can cook a much better steak at home. I would like to add that the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I came to the church brew works not to enjoy their brews (sadly I am not quite the right age); however, I did get to chow down on some of their food.  This place is real cool on the inside.  They didn't even strip out the pews; they turned them into booths.  It was real cool.  First, we got a little (and when I say little, i mean little) appetizer of nontraditional pierogies.  They were buffalo chicken pierogies.  I think they were like $8 bucks or something, and there were only 4 little pierogies.  I mean they were delicious, but there were only four?  Kind of a rip off.  For our meal we got the pizza.  It was also great.  We got the plum tomato pizza, and the cook even added our request of mushrooms on it.  My only suggestion is that they should let you get different sizes of the pizza because we wanted to try two different kinds of pizza, but we couldn't because the pizzas only came in the one large size.    I would defiantly go back to this place to get another pizza.  I cannot wait until i am 21, so i can try their home brews."}
{"text":"Not trying to throw this place under the bus. It has a really cool atmosphere and the beers are good but everyone raves about this place and I don't understand what the hype is. You can grab a good beer that is even made in house from other locations that are just as good if not better. The food is fine but parking outside is a little tough. I wouldn't say stay away from here but I also won't tell you to go here before all else."}
{"text":"Good Beer and Good Pirogies, what else could a connoisseur want? Having this all in an old church makes it that much better. Whenever I'm in da Burgh I make it a point to stop here.   Just go there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed by my overall experience here at Church Brew Works. My date and I decided to of course get their home brews even though I saw they made Dark and Stormy's, which is my favorite drink of all time. We got the buffalo pierogies, which were amazing! We also ordered the southwest wrap and it was good. I would certainly come and order those pierogies again...any day! I really enjoyed the beer and the fact that i was in a church made it that much more fun! I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"OK - I love this place.  Not because the food is the greatest (although the cinco fromaggio pizza is wonderful, the buffalo and wild mushroom meatloaf is very good and the French onion soup might just be the best in the city), but because it is such a great atmosphere.  It is an absolutely beautiful space.  However, for religious patrons, it might feel a little sacrilegious.  But for drunken heathens like me, it's great fun.  I always take out of towners here because it is such a unique space.  The beer isn't bad either.  I love my agnostic mother's comment, the first time she walked in the place - \"This is beautiful.  They should do this with ALL of the churches!\""}
{"text":"I'm waffling between giving this place 3 or 4 stars. Hell, it's a brewery in a church. Okay, its audacity earns it 4 stars.  Someone told me that Church Brew Works is one of those places you must take out of town visitors. It took me two and a half years to see the place for myself, but I have to agree. It's beautiful with its stained glass windows and high ceilings, but it doesn't take itself too seriously.  I enjoyed the two brews we tried, the Celestial Gold and the Pious Monk. The traditional pierogies we had as an appetizer were also great. The service was friendly and prompt, and our waiter saved our party of two from making a huge mistake and ordering a pizza AND another entree. Don't do this. One pizza for two people is plenty. It could probably feed three people just fine.  Unfortunately, this place slips into 3-star territory with its pizza. We split the Southwestern, which had a chipotle-tomato sauce, corn, cheese, and red onion. Interesting flavor combo, but the pie should have been cooked longer. The center of the pie was also too thin, which meant that the tip of each slice always fell apart when I tried to pick the slice up and eat it.  I'm not a churchgoer, but I'd visit this particular house of worship again for some beer and pierogies."}
{"text":"A very good brewpub. Unique and beautiful setting and tasty, interesting beer. Food is hit or miss. I had excellent onion soup and good pizza. Fries were a bit soggy, and the server was okay but not great, getting confused about what we had ordered a couple of times. Overall, very good, though!"}
{"text":"Found this place through the happy hour app! Where according to the bartender Eugene, the special is \"half off most\" of the beers and appetizers, except the specialty (high alcohol) brews, untraditional pierogies, and mussels.  For someone who used to only drink mixed cocktails and completely write off beer, I've been on a mission to change my ways by finding good beer.  I had two beers, pious monk and their pale ale, and split an order of traditional pierogies. The 4 pierogies were served on a spread of sour cream with sauteed onions and scallions. Altogether it was only ~$10 which made my day!   Be sure to ask for Eugene/Gene, he was a character who made me really like this place and the experience. Ask for him!"}
{"text":"So... this was a recommendation to tryout while in Pittsburgh.   The ambiance is awesome. The church is absolutely stunning and huge! It's set up so nicely. I love that they kept different parts of the church but incorporated the brewery in a unique way. I mean I would definitely check it out just for the views.   We were quickly sat and our server was nice. She was relatively helpful to picking things out on the menu.   The food was good but I wouldn't say the best. The kids meals were huge and my kids enjoyed them. My husband loved his food, especially the French onion soup. Mine was good, but came out sort of cold.   The prices weren't bad. There's parking behind the church or on the street. They have a shop within the restaurant where you can purchase different items."}
{"text":"The place itself is AWESOME, I mean come on you get to drink beer from an altar. The aesthetics are all there but the service is lacking and the beer is mediocre. I enjoyed their porter but all the others were very lack luster. We got the perogis and buffalo cauliflower both were really good. I actually think the service wouldn't be so bad if the place wasn't so big. There is so much space for a small staff to cover."}
{"text":"Sean & Staff, Autumn & myself totally enjoyed everything off your food menu as well as the great Brew's. Was a great experience, & i was reluctant to go. I'm a transplant from Md. & i  have never seen  anything like your great establishment, and will recommend The Church Brew Works to anyone & everyone ! Just another reason why I love this great city of Pittsburgh, & that I'm proud to say is home. See you soon."}
{"text":"This place has legit beer and good food.  The atmosphere is a little noisy, but it's a fun place that I'll definitely re-visit!"}
{"text":"We had heard really good things about Church Brew Works so we were dying to check it out. We stopped in for lunch and immediately loved the atmosphere but the food and beer were just so-so.  We started off by ordering the beer flight which only came with 7 beers instead of the usual 8. Neither of us thought that the beers were that impressive. If I had to pick a favorite, it was the Pious Monk Dunkel but I didn't love it. For lunch, we both ordered sandwiches with fries and while they weren't bad they also weren't great.  Overall, you go because it's a brewery in a church and it's a cool experience."}
{"text":"Cucumber beer was light and drinkable. Doppelboch was toasty! But Dunkel was unnecessarily bitter.   Chocolate moose cake was the bomb, and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food, good beer, amazing place to just relax. Good place to enjoy some beer in Pittsburgh. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is just cool.   I love these church converts into new and different uses. Takes a beautiful structure and breathes new life. Church Brew Works is a large, open hall of eating and drinking. And drinking many fine brews. I really love CBW beer, and often buy cases at local beer distributors.   So aside from the interior awesomeness of the church, there is ample outdoor seating that is just lovely in the nicer weather. Atmosphere-check.  The food is very good, but in my opinion a little pricy. The best deals are sandwiches or their wood fired pizzas. But still a couple things bother me. Like if you want sweet potato fries with your sandwich - its a $2 up-charge. But if you look at the prices on the side orders menu the price difference of regular fries to sweet potato fries is only $1.50. It just kinda makes it seem like they are trying to get more money from you than is justified by their own menu. Another example would be that the lunch serving and dinner serving of Jambalya are something like $8 in difference but the portion size does not change or is negligible. Just doesn't seem right.   Aside from the pricing everything I have has there is very good. A lot of good drinking food...hearty, and very often interesting.   Service is really good here. One time we had to wait before someone got to our table, and we were comped some drinks. I thought it was really good customer service, very appreciated.   This is a good place for large groups, also a good place to bring visitors who might appreciate good local beer.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and full of beer.  I ordered fried Brussel Sprouts.  People are friendly.  Oh yeah... It's in a church."}
{"text":"This place is a must see! You can have beer...in a church! It's so beautiful! I couldn't stop looking around. The beer was good too!!"}
{"text":"What could be better than drinking beer in a place that used to be a church? NOTHING! I love to be sacrilegious as much as the next beer swilling fiend and this place hit the nail on the head. Church is giant, and full of people, but don't let that detract you. The wait staff are very efficient and the food and drink are worth the wait. It's always a great time in the Burgh and I can't wait to visit church again!"}
{"text":"This is a super cool venue to grab a beer and food! Unfortunately the beer and food are not as great as the venue. Often, I have had to settle for a second or third option as they tend to run out of food."}
{"text":"I cannot speak to the food here, but drinking beer in a church seems so wrong and so right at the same time.  We sampled 3 or 4 of the beers brewed in house and they were all wonderful. One of the Belgian Style Ales (I forget the name) was absolutely delicious.  Along the same lines as many other reviews the service left a bit to be desired. Oh Church Brew Works I wanted to give you 4 stars but servers that get salty because we aren't ordering food? Minus 1 star. I mean c'mon the name of the place has Brew in the name. Maybe we should've stayed sitting at the bar...  Regardless, an awesome place to check out simply for drinking beer in what used to be a church!"}
{"text":"Been here a few time. Food, beer and service is usually good however today was the single worst experience Ive ever had in a restaurant.  Sat down with my family and there were 4 guys next us.  3 were fine the 4th was practically screaming. half hour into it, I cant take it and call the waiter over. Waiter tells me \"he isn't drunk, he is just an A-hole\".  Nice...  Anyway, another half hour passes this guy is so loud, we cannot carry on an conversation at our table. A few more F-bombs and more stories about him and his mommy issues and we call the manager over. I have kids here and there are are other tables with kids near by. He was not appropriate for children. not at all.  Manager comes over and does NOTHING. Yes, its sucks to be a manager on duty when stuff like this happens but you need to deal with it. Guy did nothing.  So, the 4 get up to leave and the tables around us all cheer and clap.   At this point,  the manager sends the waiter over to offer desert or beer on them. really didnt want to stay but the kids did so we ordered 2 deserts and i had a beer. get the bill and find out the manager meant 1 desert for the table.  So generous of him.  The manager on 12-26-16 working at 1pm needs fired. How is it fair to us to spend a whole lot of money to be miserable because he wont do is job.   I would post the pictures and videos but its probably not allowed."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Church Brew Works yet! This place is phenomenal, and I immediately recommend it to anyone who likes beer. While the atmosphere can be overwhelming for me, their food and brews are top notch and a favorite of mine. I will often buy their beer from local distributors.   The Church itself is a beautiful building and quite the spot to convert into a brewery. Pious Monk Dunkel and Thunderhop are my two favorites for different reasons. Pious Monk surprised me the first time I drank it because I was expecting something so much heavier, but it's surprisingly light for a lager, and it allows you to enjoy all of the flavors it imparts. Thunderhop is just a dream come true for hop lovers, plus the art on the bottle is pretty awesome if I do say so myself.   While their menu is certainly a pub menu, it goes above and beyond to provide options for all kinds of needs - whether you're gluten-free or vegetarian or like to chow down on quality meat-based entrees."}
{"text":"Atmosphere. Came in to check this place out on a Sunday night around 8. Crowded af, but able to find seats at the bar since people sit there until they're called to an actual dining table.   Very spacious and airy, but loud loud loud.  Food: didn't have anything to eat here except beer and the brewmasu. I forget the name of the draft, but it had hints of passion fruit. It was tangy, but overall average.   The brewmasu was really good. Couldn't really taste any beer, but it was light, airy and not too sweet.   Service: worst part of our experience. It was a busy night but they only  had two bartenders.  The minute we sat a bartender asked us what we wanted, but we didn't have a chance to look at the menu so we asked for a minute. Unfortunately she gave us 15-20 minutes and disappeared. A male bartender came by, apologized saying it was busy, but then walked away and didn't come back for another five minutes. I paid for the beers and then we later ordered the dessert. Then when we asked to pay for the dessert he charged us for two beers and the brewmasu. We rectified the situation, but yeah, services was a mess and was severely lacking and it made our stay longer than it needed to be.   Pretty much, come here for the vibe and just to say you've been in a brewery that was once a church. That's what we did and it was an a-okay experience."}
{"text":"Having waited nearly two years to try Church Brew Works, I was sorely disappointed by the food and beer, but overwhelmed by the atmosphere. There's really no comparing the atmosphere to anything else - it's in an old church, of course, and the high ceilings and stained glass windows are overwhelming. Unfortunately, my burger was subpar, and I've never really enjoyed any of CBW's beer - the fact that it was on tap from the brewery didn't help. Furthermore, my waiter was incredibly odd - lame jokes, and all, which detracted a bit from the experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful church! Amazingly massive place to have a huge group get turnt (yeah, I said turnt). But the service is completely lacking. God shall smite this restaurant if they don't get their service together. Also, pricing per ratio of food is way off. Nachos are basically what I would make at home, only I pay $$$ for a small portion of mediocre food. You'll be left with lots of chips and nothing to dip them in, which is ungodly. The atmosphere makes it worthwhile, as does the beer list, but the options and service take this place straight to hell (Slayer's South of Heaven opening riff starts now). God is dead."}
{"text":"Ok, this place has such a mix of reviews that I know they can't be all true. Come on, give me a break. If I hadn't eaten here on numerous occasions, I wouldn't know what to think. Some days the beer is fantastic and some days it sucks? I think NOT!    I think that the ups and downs noted are just a matter of individual taste . . . or perhaps, lack of.  I say . . .go try it for yourself.  The fact that it is a restaurant and brew works that has been put in an old church is worth the trip alone. Worth it just to see what can be done with a great old building and a little imagination.  Try the beer. Have lunch or dinner. See what you think. Don't let a few misguided souls scare you off.   I've usually found that when a place has so many reviews that are so across the board it is because some folks get out of their comfort zone . . . they begin to get uncomfortable when things deviate. Or when you put them in a church.  Well, I'm here to tell you that good food comes in all sorts of shapes & colors & flavors. Of course, so does bad,  But the one thing I know is that . . .  it can't be both.   Which review to believe?  None! Go try it for yourself!  So my vote is for 5 stars. I have never been disappointed in the food or the service . . . and by jove, the atmosphere is as close to heaven as you are going to get in a Brew Works!"}
{"text":"Cool location, our waiter was super nice. We got the beer flight sampler and left with a good buzz to finish our afternoon and start into the evening. We didn't get any food however everything that came out to other tables didn't look too appetizing"}
{"text":"I very rarely give anything 5 stars which should go to saying how much I liked this place.    My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday shortly after they opened while on a road trip. We were kind of apprehensive based on some of the reviews on yelp but since this was the only brewery open on Sunday we figured how bad could it actually be.   To our great surprise it was amazing.    The service was top notch The food was great and very original The beer was well balanced and while they had some simple flag ships they also had some amazing experimental brews. The space....Whats there to say about a church being turned into a brewery other than AWESOME!  If you are ever in the area make it a point to stop in and check this brewery out. They have been around for 17 years so they are not just jumping on the craft beer crazy but have put years of work into perfecting their brand and beer."}
{"text":"Now you won't find Friar Tuck swigging away the mead at CBW, but you'll be sinfully delighted to partake in a little yourself. And no, you won't hear Handel's Messiah here, just the hiss and pop of the stills. The smell of hops and barley has long ago replaced sacred incense. Imbibing home crafted brews has since supplanted conducting elaborately scripted and ritualistic rites.  And the monks would doubtlessly have had it no other way.   Places like this really bring out my inner apologist. So come to CBW to see brewing, consuming and selling alcohol in a sanctuary. Then buy a shirt, have a shot and flirt with a waitron.  The owners have truly gotten back to the whole point of Christendom."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for work and one of the local guys suggested we try the Church Brew.  I'm not very familiar with Pittsburgh, but this place was somewhat out of the way.  It didn't have many interesting things around it.  Basically it's a bar/brewery built into an old abandoned church.  The place has been restored and is truly beautiful inside, with gorgeous stained glass windows, church pews, alter, and of course dining tables.    We sat down and I watched as 4 of the waitstaff walked by without acknowledging out existence.  It turns out one of the waitstaff that ignored us, was our waiter.  Eventually he stopped by and took our drink order.  I ordered the Mexican Mole Stout, which was pretty good.  As the name suggests, it is a stout with mole spices.  I like stouts and love spicy food, so this was a must try.  As I said, it was good, but far from refreshing, so I suggest a glass of water with it.    After some time, our waiter again decided he should stop by and take a food order.  We both ordered the Shinkasa Cheese Steak because I was after all in PA...not Philly, but PA nonetheless.  When it finally arrived the sandwich was very good, but overpriced at $11 for it's size.  The fries portion was also small, but they were not that great anyway.  We waited again for the bill after completing our meals.  I would have actually ordered another beer because I wanted to try another of their varieties, but our waiter never returned.  My review gets 3 stars mostly based on the very cool setting of a brewery being in a church and the Mexican Mole Stout being tasty.  However the food is overpriced and the service was poor.  Cool place to try once, but I wouldn't consider this a \"must see\"."}
{"text":"Being able to eat in an old church is worth the experience alone! We literally had lunch in an old pew, with enormous brewing machinery on the altar behind us. It was holy.  The service was really great, even though it was really busy we were sat quickly, and our waiter was attentive.  I thought the food was pretty good, we got the vegetarian pirogies and a pasta dish that was fresh and tasty.   They're known mostly for their beers that they brew in-house, but it was too early for us to get started drinking. People near us had ordered the beer flight, and from what I could tell it seemed like a great value, so it's still on my list to go back and try next time I'm in Pitty.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot, but maybe trying to go at an off hour to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. The interior is so cool and it's great to just look at it. I got the pierogie saute and it was one of the greatest dinners I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I'd like to comment on the food, unfortunately I was unable to actually eat here because apparently their pizza ovens have been down for a month or so.  Yes, there were other menu items, but I went specifically to try the pizzas and since they were not available, I spent my money elsewhere.  I may have eaten something else, but I was especially annoyed that we had to wait to be seated before being informed about the broken pizza oven.  Be warned: Call to make sure they actually have their full menu before you actually stop in."}
{"text":"Let me break this down for you...  Food: 4 Ambiance: 5 Beer: 2 Service: 3  I think I was the only person who really loved my meal, which made me sad. Our appetizers (pierogi of the day and risotto fritters) weren't that great so I wasn't expecting anything amazing from my dinner. I ordered the cranberry, turkey and brie sandwich. It did not disappoint! It's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, but the fries were less than tasty.  Friends shared the southwest pizza and said it was so spicy it was inedible. Normally I would say it's too bad they ordered something spicy and it was too spicy, but the menu didn't even mention it being spicy or they wouldn't have ordered it! Other friend had the PGH style salad, about which she didn't have much to say and the boyfriend had the Cubano and said it was mediocre at best (surprising, as he loves Cubans and they're rarely bad).  The ambiance was awesome! I loved how evil it felt to eat in a one-time church that was used to brew and serve beer and spirits. It's really pretty inside, and has a nice feel.  The German-style beers I had were watery, too sweet or too lemony. Pretty disappointing considering since they're a brewery! Maybe I'm just too demanding, maybe I'm just like my father (couldn't help myself) when it comes to German-style beers.  Our server was so rushed that I felt badly for her. There should have been someone from management helping her with her tables. It was probably just an off night, but it was a little disappointing nonetheless.  If I lived in da Burgh, I'd probably come here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I certainly won't make it a \"must eat\" place when I'm visiting."}
{"text":"Before Reading please note my review is mainly based on the service and food, as I did not try beer. I did try their wine and I was pleased with bottle pricing and taste so if you are just looking to make a pit stop for a drink consider this a 3 star review. If youa re looking to eat pass this place up. A couple of basic issues first there is little to no parking neighborhood or in the lot in the back if you are going on a weekend night so plan ahead. This is ok I can deal with it if I love the place, second I was supposed to be seated with a large group but my friend and I would have been split up due to the pew seating. This was ok it was our fault for being late. We chose to sit in the bar instead of wait for our own table. So we get in the bar and service at a table was super slow we get our wine within 10-20 minutes of sitting which is fine but I think the food took 55 minutes for two sandwiches. The food was just bleh not high on taste after that wait and the hype I have heard I was hoping for more. But it is just another chain resaurant hiding inside a church (let down). I got the philly cheesesteak sandwich my friend the crab cake because we were hoping for something quick and filling. Cheese steak was just ok bun was too big and lack of  generic cheese sauce made it dry, no sauteed onions or peppers ( again let down.) My friend had the crabcake sandwich and they had not put any sauce on it. The waitress did bring her a tiny bit of sauce as it was supposed to come with sauce. Here is the kicker the sweet potato fries we both paid  $2.00 extra on top of our 15$ sandwiches for are from Sam's club! Hahahaha I have to laugh because if you're going to serve me precooked fries which I am sure a lot of places do don't charge me extra and at least try to make sure they are wedges or something. Throw a cajun spice rub on but don't barely heat them they were super cold.... and buy them at Sam's club. If you're one of hte most hyped breweries in pgh! People notice these things lol. At least it provided me with a good laugh. So all in all 4 stars for atmosphere yea its a cool place young attractive crowd, but I am a food lover 1-2 stars for food, 3 stars for drinks. Part of town is tricky to maneuver at night. I would pass and try another brewery in town because food and beer are lovely when done properly together and maybe church brew works needs to build a better kitchen."}
{"text":"There's nothing else like it East of the Mississippi.  Food is average to pretty good ...  But you are going for the beer ... beer is top shelf.  Ambiance is top shelf.  If you don't like this place, there is something wrong with you."}
{"text":"I felt like I might be struck by lightning walking in, but the cool interior would have made it worth it. If you're in the area I would stop for a bite or beer just to see the layout of this place. You'll never see another restaurant or brewery like it. I unfortunately didn't try a beer since I'm not much of a drinker anymore, but I did give the perogies a shot. I will say... I was disappointed. They tasted like a hard pot sticker and I am used to a perogies absolutely drenched in butter moistness. I didn't get this today unfortunately. They weren't bad, but I've just had better pretty much everywhere I've had them. Do give this place a try because it is a very cool old church building.   Ps. Pricing is a little on the high side."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Not surprisingly, this restaurant and brewery is a pretty bizarre and fun experience! To be honest, I'm actually glad that they managed to preserve the beauty of this structure, versus tearing it down, and to use it for something that continues to bring joy to folks. It sure makes for quite a dining event.   In terms of the overall experience, I can say that it about lived up to my expectations, which were modest but optimistic. They are generally packed with customers, and we were there on a particularly busy weekend night, so just a warning not to expect a speedy evening at this pub. But the wait staff was friendly, helpful, and as prompt as possible considering what they had to work with in terms of clientele volume.   We came for the beer and, unfortunately, I would say that I wasn't a huge fan in that respect. None of them really stood out to me as having that interesting of a flavor. I also tried the mead and was not enamored. They do make some decent mixed drinks, though.   The food was nothing overwhelmingly impressive, but it was surprisingly vegetarian-friendly with some actual effort behind forming the dishes, which is honestly pretty unusual for a pub. I did try the traditional pierogies, which were not the greatest but definitely were tasty and quickly devoured by all. The main attraction for me was the veggie spaghetti, which I gobbled up happily. Usually I would expect to find a meal like this to be not all that filling, but wow did this dish satisfy! I appreciated the variety of vegetables in the dish, and the red pepper pesto was quite flavorful. Ultimately, while this was typical pub food in quality, I appreciated the effort that they put into making unique and flavorful vegetarian dishes, so they get bonus points in my book there.  Overall, this was a fun, unusual dining experience that made for great conversation amongst our large group of hungry, diverse diners. It's a solid place to go with a mixed group when you want a fun, relaxed vibe in a unique environment."}
{"text":"I originally rated Church Brew Works back in 2013.  This was after a few visits both just to sit at the bar and to have dinner.  Four years ago I was less of a beer snob and the Church had their pizza oven.  I am updating my review after two visits in 2017.  My wife, daughter and I visited shortly after they lost their brick oven for pizza and were underwhelmed, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but after my last lackluster visit I cannot keep staying positive.  Some friends were in town and wanted to find a place that would both accommodate the 7 of us and not be a chain.  Since we had kids we had to sit on the right side of the church, which is now \"fine dining\".  We tried to get the bar menu after looking at the menu, but were told no.  It was awkward sitting at that table for 10 minutes just starring at the choices.  We had no one come greet us and ask us about drinks, we just sat wondering what we'll have for dinner.  The menu consists of a mishmash of high end and try hard.  Pierogies, ribs, steaks, and pastas ranging from $15-$30 a plate.  Nothing jumped out at us....it was sad.  I was just about to ask if everyone wanted to just leave when finally a server asked us if we wanted some beer.  My good friend got the coconut stout and my wife the Pipe Organ Pale.  Both were good, but in Pittsburgh standards today fell flat as there are much better options.  We ended up staying and got the pork nachos and spinach roll for apps.  The spinach roll was tasty, crispy, and satisfying.  The nachos were good enough to pick at, but again were average like the beers.  The kiddos all got their chicken fingers and random sides.  My daughter wanted sweet potato fries, but that's a $2 up-charge....so another words a $10 kids meal.  No way.  My wife split the full rack of ribs and while they were good, I again didn't want to gorge myself on them and will not be back to have them again. I miss the pizza, the allure has worn off, and the menu is an expensive mess.  Sorry to say, but after years of recommending the Church Brew Works I will no longer. It was fun while it lasted."}
{"text":"Always love the Pious Monk Dunkel at PNC Park. Today I'm loving the Christmas Ale w a Pierogi Pizza. Yummy."}
{"text":"Several recent visits.  Church Brew Works is not maintaining its level or service, not the appearance of the place from the outside.  As noted before, the flower beds are weedy, plants/trees need pruned, trimmed and cut down, the back parking lot is just a mess.  While I used to consider this a \"show place\" for new people coming into town, I no longer do.  It is, from the outside, shoddy.   Inside, it maintains itself okay but on the last two visits, the service staff seemed distracted and focused on working the tip -- and not particularly knowledgeable about the craft beers on the menu.  Place feels like it is coasting now.  Meh. I've experience better.  Indeed, for a GREAT experience, go to East End Brewing --- service is fantastic, beers are great (easily beyond CBW), and they continue to evolve.   Sorry for the comparison but it is what it is.  CBW is off the \"show me something of Pittsburgh\" list now.  f8 and be there."}
{"text":"This was the most hyped place of the trip i went on and it did not deliver. All of the beer they had was pretty bad. The mint chocolate chip stout was horrible, no one could finish there sampler of it. There perogies were meh but there pizza was pretty damn good.   Service was horrible. The bartender was an ass and our server said maybe 2 words to us. And there was an hour wait at the door and a hour wait for the pizza once we ordered. And of course they wouldnt seperate our order.   This place it a tourist trap. Stay away."}
{"text":"Didn't get food but greatly appreciated the Happy Hour and the fact that I could relish in the feeling of drinking delicious beer in a church after too many years of Catholic school. Mrs. Paddock-Kaminsky this is for what you put me through."}
{"text":"Visiting from Milford, Ohio.  My husband was very excited about checking out this place.  WOW!  Beautiful!!  I took a ton of pictures, loved reading about the place.  I'm not a beer drinker but my hubby says the IPA was good; the others he tasted were not as memerable. I felt like the food prices were too high.   The experience was great:)"}
{"text":"Awesome decor, a must try for fans of Belgian beer and great food to go with it. I bought a bottle of a Belgian quadruple cherry and washed down a very balanced shrimp and grits. Their pumpkin and chorizo risotto fritters and beer cheese soup were awesome. My girlfriend had a salmon burger with fried Brussels sprouts and sundried tomatoes - really really tasty and balanced. Liked it so much, we grabbed lunch the next day on our way out of town. If I lived here, I'd be back every week. These folks have it all down from decor to beer to food."}
{"text":"I really usually like the Church Brew Works but last night, maybe a fluke, was just not up to snuff. I had fun because of the people that I was with but the food and service was just lacking.....  We had a group of 5 people that wanted to go out to dinner and hang out on a Saturday night. Fran, one of the friends, called the restaurant and asked if they took reservations. The lady said that they did not and it was first come first serve but gave no indication of how long that could be. She said, \"I am sure we can get you in soon.\" If you hear something like that you just assume that the wait is not that long. Well....we got there and the wait was an hour and a half or more. Waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhtttt??? Why wouldn't you say that over the phone? Not impressed at all. But we decided to stay. The only good thing is that the left side of the Church Brew Works is no reservations. So, if you were wily enough you could just wait for a table to open up and hope you get there fast enough to grab it.  Good news, I'm like a wily cat and grabbed a table, before they even cleared it, and we were seated 20 minutes or less after we got there. Big accomplishment! So we sat down and ordered some drinks and just looked over the menu.   That is when the server issue started. Our server was no where to be seen throughout the entire dinner experience. And even to get the check took forever. I did not see many servers and even saw two managers helping out so I just assumed they must have been short staffed.  But that and not being told that there was that long of a wait bumped them to two stars.  Food: Cup of French Onion Soup: This was actually really good. This soup was really well made and was not salty at all. It had a great flavor to it. I really enjoyed the croutons and the melted cheese on the top. I wish there was a little more cheese and less of the croutons but overall it was well made.  Lettuce Wraps: Diced southwest rubbed chicken breast tossed in a soy ginger reduction. Served with julienne carrots and zucchini noodles in an Asian sweet and sour sauce, crushed peanuts, and bibb lettuce. Umm...the chicken was served cold. The chicken was not warm it was cold. That is not something that we were expecting at all. When I think lettuce wraps I usually have had the chicken hot/warm. Not these one they were served cold. The chicken was also in chunks and not ground. I am on the fence about that. While it was easier to handle not many people could share this dish because the were not many chunks.   Side salad: This side salad was huge. I was impressed with the portion size. The blue cheese dressing was also on point. I enjoyed this the most.   Pizza: Wild Boar BBQ Slow roasted pulled wild boar, Dunkel bbq sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese. The pizza was so salty it was almost inedible to both Chris and I. AND it was $22. Nothing about this pizza was good. The pizza had too much sauce on it so it was floppy and each slice fell if you lifted it. The cheese over took the pizza and was choking. There was not a lot of the corn or red onions to counter act the taste of the bbq sauce that was not appetizing at all. And the boar was too salty as said before. I ate one slice, Chris ate one, and we ended up giving a $22 pizza away to someone who said they might want to eat it. Ugh... disappointing for sure.   I know they are good! I know I have had really good experiences here. Yesterday was just not one of them. If I go back I just hope that I don't have to write them off completely."}
{"text":"sweet place. its a must see in my opinion. the only downside is that they dont post the prices of the beers. my brother was having a rough day and when he couldnt see the prices it like sent him over the edge and he cried a little. Anyways, the beers heavenly and the atmosphere is divine."}
{"text":"Fantastic setting.  Wonderful service.  Good food - but not great.  I've been here three times now, and the place is consistent.  It's a very satisfying place to be - great setting (albeit a bit loud due to the beer brewing setup), great people.  Good food (not divine but definitely tasty!) and the beer is pretty good quality - a tad watery.  Overall, though, I'll be back again, I'm sure, because it's just such a fantastic experience overall."}
{"text":"If Church Brew Works is declining in quality, I can't see it, and apparently neither can most area diners as this former place of worship was rather bustling yesterday evening.   Megan, our server, was phenomenal, I still couldn't detect any of the \"foul odors\" other reviewers have complained about, and our food, from starter to dessert, was uniformly excellent.   For instance, our duo of appetizers were faultlessly executed. Unable to decide upon The Wild Boar Quesadillas and their Belgian Fries with Lemon Caper Aioli, we opted for both.   The quesadillas included the titular protein along with black beans, scallions, cheddar, and smoked gouda, making for a starchy, acidic, sharp, campfire creamfest within flour tortillas, the rich yet lean meat of the primordial hog permeating the triangles in domineering chunks. Red pepper sour cream and salsa verde colorfully garnished the rip-snorting opening dish while also adding twang and sting.   The Belgian Fries were served in a portion that rivaled that of \"The O\" in terms of size and in twice-fried crispiness, the tart aioli adding a brackish, olive-like decadence Oakland's institution would find a tad too gourmet.   After looking through both the dinner and pub menus, I put my finger on the Buffalo Meatloaf despite it creating some redundancy in my meal with the inclusion of roasted pesto potatoes, but with that sautéed mushroom medley adding savory heft, and the roasted tomato demi-glace playing the role of ketchup brilliantly, I barely minded. Even those cubed spuds themselves climbed out of the doldrums (I never get excited over roasted potatoes) simply by being brushed with that arcane Genovese sauce of crushed garlic, basil, pine nuts, olive oil, and Parmesan. The weight of the steakhouse-worthy dish, however, was successfully carried by the two Stonehengian slabs of coarsely ground Buffalo that were as sweet and Earthy as the grass of the plains yet carried with them a moisture that belied their leanness.   Dessert was a tornado tag-team brawl pitting Kay and I between their Chocolate Mousse Cake and Malted Bread Pudding. Served in halves, the kitchen must have instinctually known of our intention to swap and share. The sublime cakes were mortared (martyred?) by a weightless mousse and were baptized in a ganache that artfully bled down the sides of each, making them into the most elegant lunchbox treats ever realized. Alongside the cakes came amber shards of briny peanut brittle that not only countered the cakes' silken texture with their crunch factor but also complimented their subtlety by bringing the bulk of the sugar.   The bread pudding was a bulky french toast imbibed with beery flavors and topped with chocolate malted ice cream (a collaboration with Dave & Andy's ice cream parlor), turning the dessert into quite the ode to a la mode.   CBW has lost none of its culinary allure. Like rock 'n roll and hip-hop (and of course my beloved heavy metal \m/ ), it is here to stay."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight.  We ordered their pizza roll appetizer with spinach artichoke dip that came with tortilla chips.  Hubby ordered their buffalo chicken pierogi sauté and I ordered their mushroom meatloaf.  We ordered their bread pudding for dessert and got 2 scoops of chocolate cookie ice cream.  What's hot - The atmosphere.  Very unique.  Not often you can find a church that's been converted to a brewery. - Flavor.  The taste of the food was pretty decent.  I address some of the quality issues below, but despite that, the flavor of the food was good.  Not bangin, but good. - Menu variety.  There's something for everyone, which is helpful.  They have vegetarian menu options, too.  Their drinks selection is pretty cool, especially because they brew their own beer.      What's not - No reservations.  We came with some family and they tried to make reservations, but they wouldn't take it.  Seems impractical that they don't take reservations, especially if you have a decent size party. - Portions.  Our waiter told us that the spinach artichoke dip was a good portion that could feed the 4 in our party.  Dudes, not the case.  The dip was in a small bowl (prolly 1-2 inches in diameter).  It most definitely was not a good portion. - My meat loaf was dry.  When I would cut into my meatloaf, the pieces would sometimes fall apart. - The buffalo chicken pierogi sauté didn't have the chicken meat in the pierogis.  Hubby and his brother expected chicken in the pierogi.  Dudes, the menu specifically has an untraditional pierogi dish listed on the menu.  The description on the menu wasn't good enough and it's misleading.  While the pierogis were still good, the menu was misleading. - Brother and his gf ordered frozen peanut butter pie for dessert.  And dudes, it was seriously frozen.  As in, it took serious effort to cut through the pie in order to eat it.  We get that it's a frozen pie, but you shouldn't make the customers work so hard to eat their food.   - Service.  Once we paid for our check, our waiter didn't come by.  Our group stayed to chat for a little while after we were done.  For me, the mark of good service is when the wait staff check in on you after.  Cuz dudes, who knows if there may be another order coming?  Final answer Willing to come back, but not a first choice."}
{"text":"A true place of worship I can get behind.   Church Brew Works is an old church redesigned as a brewery. A place I can truly pray at. Forgive me father I have sinned, I drank crappy commercial beer at the stadium earlier.   The place is huge. Find a seat by the bar though and you'll be in good hands. Or grab a table if you want some grub. The menu is quite extensive. They have some award winning beers on tap.   This is a great place to come with a crew of people.  Come find your inner spirit and have it wake up to Church Brew Works."}
{"text":"Wonderful pirogues and beer. Certainly the best church food I've ever had =). Seriously though, it's nice that a building that was going to be torn down could be turned into a thriving establishment that is one of a kind to the beat of my knowledge."}
{"text":"Just came home from a very disappointing experience at Church Brew Works. My husband and I have been here many times over the years with large groups and by ourselves with no complaints. Unfortunately this time the service was terrible. We ordered and waited 25 minutes before our server came to our table and asked if we wanted another round of beers. No - I wanted our dinner. We asked if my Seven Onion soup was coming and it became pretty obvious that she forgot to put our order in. Our dinner finally came almost 45 minutes after we ordered. She never acknowledged what happened or apologized. We had to track down a Manager to explain the situation. While she did remove both of our entrees from our final bill, no one (server or manager) took responsibility for the poor service or said they were sorry. We will not be going back. Steer clear of Church Brew Works if you are looking for an actual service experience when you go out to eat."}
{"text":"Just visited Church Brew Works for the 2nd time and I was  just as thrilled as the 1st.  The beer is good and the food will surprise you!  Love that they converted a local historic landmark!  Very cool atmosphere from the beautiful stain glass to the pipe organ.  Wait staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept, but nothing too original here. In Pittsburgh, there are bars, condos, concert venues, etc that were all once churches. The beer is great - get the munk dunkel, skip the mole stout - and you can take home a pony too!"}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars in every way. It's worth the trip just to see an honest to goodness cathedral converted to a beautiful brewery and restaurant. It is truly a marvel.  We were just in the city for one night (family of four from Philadelphia passing through on our way further west) and I am do glad we spent it here. We had: hummus, wings, buffalo burger, pulled pork taco, and pulled pork tostadas, and shaved asparagus salad (yes we were hungry and put kids are growing!) The only thing that was just ok was the hummus (it was fine but not great)--everything else was great. We also sampled: cherry quadzilla (very different and tasty) Kenya coffee pale ale (unexpected combo that worked).   Service was friendly and attentive and knowledgable. Crowd was nice. Comfortable having a family there but not overrun by kids and families.   Try this place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! I went here for dinner 2 weeks ago with my sister and had a great time. Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly, but we never felt rushed (despite our very slow ordering and eating). We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich and thought it was delicious.   The only flaw was that we each ordered a beer samplers flight and I found all of the beers to be extremely heavy and dark. There were several beers in the sampler flight that neither of us liked one bit (and we have extremely different tastes when it comes to beer). Overall I prefer lighter beers and there were non of those so the flight was a big let down. If you like the beers in the flight then its a great amount of beer, but if you don't like the majority of them, it is really tough to finish. [The beer flight includes 8 12-oz beers - see picture.]"}
{"text":"Very impressive menu. The gluten-free menu was actually enticing. The pumpkin risotto fritters was an amazing starter. The house-made chicken sausage patties were flavorful, and a perfect texture, and served with sweet potatoes and apples.  Husband greatly enjoyed the buffalo meatloaf. Beware however: although the house-made fries start out gluten free, THEY ARE NOT COOKED IN A DEDICATED FRYER. Depending on your sensitivity level, this could cause a reaction. Home made vanilla ice cream, with home made caramel sauce was a great end to the meal. Oh, yeah.........DH loved the beer flight, too."}
{"text":"5-star experience! If anyone knows me knows I love a good happy hour, and Church Brew Works has an incredible happy hour. Half off almost all the apps on the menu and a plethora of beer and wine specials. Drafts are constantly rotating so there's always something for everyone.   Our server was amazing, she was so pleasant and attentive to everything we asked for. Extremely knowledgeable about every menu item we could think of and had impeccable timing.   I don't think I've had better perogies in Pittsburgh. Full of flavor and cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and soft and steamy on the inside. Pepperoni and spinach rolls were also unbelievable. Get here now, don't let the altar and stained glass fool you. Amazing dining!"}
{"text":"After a long while of considering going to the church brew works, I was invited by some friends to go.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed by the wait staff not being able to comprehend a simple drink order such as a Pepsi.  After I received my meal I have to say their portions of their dishes are very mismatched.  I would not recommend going for food, maybe a beer, but not food."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh, so I figured this would be a good choice for my first \"yelp\".  Plenty of other folks can go into the history of the building and you can get those details from them, I just want to rave about the food and the BEER.  Church Brew's beers are some of the first brewed-in-Pittsburgh selections we tried when we moved here and they're still among our favorites.  Especially fun is their stout, which is made a little differently each batch and usually features some special ingredients (gives you a great reason to try it every visit).  The food is wonderful and combined with the tasty brews and the unique atmosphere, it's no surprise that for lots of people this is one of those \"take anyone from out of town when they visit\" places.  In fact, some employers take interviewees there to show the place off as one of the cooler things about Pittsburgh.  The portions are *generous* so if two average-appetite folks want to make it from an appetizer through to dessert (especially with some beer) consider splitting an entree.  Definitely consider splitting dessert, especially if you order the bread pudding (our personal favorite).  Also, in addition to their more german-influenced dishes, the Church Brew Works offer some unique and tasty pizza pies.  It's worth noting that the pizza menu is served an hour after than the kitchen closes, so it's an excellent option for late dining.  If you've never been and you pass through the Pittsburgh area, don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Thank you, Brett, for another fantastic experience (even though there was no pizza...haha). We drove four hours and could NOT wait for our pierogie meal when we got to town. We brought family for their first time and they loved it too. I wish I had thought to take more pictures. The bread is soft and fresh. The hummus has just the right seasoning. The pierogies have no competition. Add in the ambiance and terrific staff, and you have to equation for a perfect night out."}
{"text":"Summer of '02. I don't know if it was planned but Al Roker's Microbrewery special was filming there. I was eating and drinking and the film crew stopped by and asked me a question. \"How does it feel to drink in a church\" and I replied \"I'm not religious so it doesn't bother me\". National TV and I couldn't think of anything clever. Looking back I should've said \"god wants you to get wasted\", which still isn't clever.  I was on TV one other time at a beer event in Chicago. They asked me how I was and I yelled \"I love Germans!\" It was a german beer festival."}
{"text":"I like the digs. The catholic in me is all, \"oh I feel so guilty for eating in a church,\" but then I'm like, eh it's okay food so it's okay in general.   We got a sampling of the beers they had to drink over the fourth of july. Some were good, some, like Heckbrosia?something to that name, were a little on the \"Oh, they must be testing flavors, right?\" side.   The food was decent, not quite as impressive as the decor or varieties of beer."}
{"text":"The atmosphere gets a 5. Visitors love it here because it's literally an old church, and they have *barely* changed things to make it into a restaurant and bar. They still have pews and an alter and stained glass. Plus, the vibe is great. Very laid back and friendly. Beer flowing.  However, it's hard to review Church with a single rating because it's two different things...well, almost three: a brewery, a bar, and a restaurant.  The brewery (4/5) Church brews a bunch of beer, and they are all quite good. Two of my favorites are the Millennium Trippel and the Ambrosia Ale. When they are pouring these two, I rush over because they rock. The Ambrosia tastes like beer plus champagne. Seriously. You must try it. If you like a Belgian, the Trippel is awesome. Plus, it's pretty high ABV so you'll feel mighty nice after drinking it.  The bar (4/5) The bar area (the LEFT side) is a little chaotic because it's first come, first served. On Friday and Saturday nights and game nights, there are very few seats and it can be a long wait to get food. However, given the proximity to the beer, you get faster beer delivery. Also, the primary menu over here is the \"Bar\" menu, and I personally prefer this menu. It's got your typical bar food, like the wings or the fries or the hummus, and they do good bar food! If you eat pizza, get a pizza. Their pizzas are great and huge!  The restaurant (2/5) This side is a good place to go if you need to bring the kiddos. While you get your food much faster, it can take forever to get a beer. One time we didn't even get our beer! If you side on the RIGHT side, you must ask for the bar menu. The salads and entrees are okay, but there are much better places to get this type of food. Unless you really need a salad, stick to the bar food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Definitely a place to take out of town visitors due to the \"wow\" factor it has when you walk in the door. Love the stained glass windows, the beer garten quality it has to it. Just a unique place overall. Their waitstaff was attentive although a little clumsy when pouring water, but whatever. The only thing I really cared about is that they didin't spill my drink. I ended  up ordering their beer flight which will definitely leave you toasty.   For my entree I ordered the Heirloom Tomato salad with I big honkin' piece of salmon, which was perfectly cooked. Their dressing was just perfect with this combination. My husband ordered their cheese pizza which was absolutely huge, so be prepared for left overs. Oh and for appetizers we had their peroguies which were pretty solid.   I'll definetely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but the beers and ambiance are the focal point. CONS: It is incredibly loud; and, food takes too long to come out. PROS: The beer is fresh and tasty; and, the church itself is gorgeous."}
{"text":"I've been to this pace a few times the food isnt bad, but I've never had anything so good that I would order it again.  I got the pork porterhouse dinner, the pork was over cooked not to tender, it came with two patotoe pancakes they were really good.  I did have  the white mango sangria to drink. So good I had two!  This place is really cool inside, because its in an old church, lots of people take pictures when they walk in. They get really busy here if you dont come earlier for dinner on weekend dont be surprised to have an hour wait!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is terrific and truly one of a kind. If nothing else, this place is worth a visit just for the experience of the interior. As for the food, it's good but nothing exceptional. I had a house salad and an order of the traditional pierogies. The pierogies are just how I like - crispy and buttery! If you order an entree size pierogies, the sautéed ones come in a creamy, Alfredo-type sauce (not my jam, but my group seemed to really enjoy them). We also tried the Spinach/Gouda/Feta appetizer which was good - but again nothing to brag about. I think I'd like this place more just to sit in the pub area with some appetizers and drinks. On a weekday evening, it is usually pretty empty, but on a weekend I've seen it pretty packed."}
{"text":"I have so wanted to drag my boyfriend here for months.  After a trip to the Zoo, we ended up here for a very late lunch.  I work with a guy that raves about the place.  Of course, he likes to drink beer.  The setting is amazing.  You have to go to check that out at least once in your life.  You can spends hours trying to take it all in.  BJ reported his brew to be okay.  He had the Pittsburgh Pierogie Pizza with potato puree, sautéed onions, garlic and cheddar cheese.  He never leaves scraps, but did on this occasion.  So, I'm sure that's not saying a lot for the pizza.  I sampled it, it was tastey, but also very dry.  I opted for the Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich.  The pork was pretty much tasteless, and I failed to taste any BBQ sauce.  Also, the ciabatta bread was pretty tough.  My sweet potatoes fries were good and they should be since there was a $2 upcharge for the little suckers.    Maybe we ordered the wrongs things.  Or maybe dinner is bettter.  All I can say, is once is enough for this girl."}
{"text":"For years...and I mean YEARS, I've heard of it, avoided it, and never had the least curiosity about it. It seemed like a waste of a ginormous building, and hype, hype, hype.  Plus, not being a beer drinker at ALL, the 'Brew' part certainly wasn't going to draw me in. But this past week, someone that I've been playing dueling restaurants with took me to Church Brew Works to see what it was all about.  Well, I guess it's pretty cool, if you're a tourist, a beer drinker, or don't mind busting a bank account on one meal.  The atmosphere is kind of cool in a kitschy way. Take a building once used to drain the soul, and turn it over to something that FEEDS the soul (or at least the liver). Not only is the enormous brew machinery on the altar a very cool replacement for bleeding martyrs, but it finally gives da burgh the centerpiece of worship that is befitting them. In addition to the apse-de-brew, all of the seating has been created from the old pews. Even the menus reflect old church programs.  Speaking of atmosphere and menus...I don't eat atmosphere, as I've pointed out in many other reviews. I ultimately go to an eatery to EAT. So after five minutes of taking in the 'atmosphere', I delved into the menu to make a selection.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the offerings, and I definitely was not impressed with the prices. If I end up planning my meal according to the menu prices, I've gone to the wrong place. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. We both chose a steak with cheesy potatoes and a corn salad, that was in the $15 range. My friend chose the 'beer sampler', which was like ten small glasses of beer that were supposed to be drunk in a specific order.  So our order was placed, and now on to sucking in more 'atmosphere'.  And I DO have to say that whoever places the orders for the wait studs in this place has impeccable taste in dark featured hunky real looking men. I was ready to take communion at any moment, or study up on what it means to be an altar boy.  Ok, atmosphere over, on to the food. The steak was cooked the way I liked it, and was very tender and flavorful. The cheesy potatoes, which I firmly believe are the leftovers from stuffing home made pierogis, was very pleasant and tasty as well. The corn salad, I could have used a few more words on the menu, or a heads up as to what all was in it, as onions are not my friend. I also think they could use a little better aim when putting it on the plate, or not use it as a sauce to top everything else on the plate, which seems to be what the aim was. I really didn't need the corn salad on the steak, or even dribbling over the potatoes.   On the whole, except for the potential acid reflux from the surprise onions, the meal was satisfying and pretty good.   Then came the dessert menu, and my friend opted for coconut cheesecake, and I had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu itself was great. My suggestion would be to drop the kind of fakey tasting chocolate poo blobs decorating the plate. They did nothing to enhance the flavor of the tiramisu, which would have been absolutely perfect by itself.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, the meal was good, and my friend liked most of his beer (with ten of them, it's naturally going to be hit or miss). The atmosphere was pleasant and not TOO over the top 'sports bar' video screenage, and the eye candy just kept walking back and forth.  But once again, I am drawn back to the high pricing, which is what will prevent me from becoming a regular. I'm not even a fan of being treated when the prices are that high. And as I said...if I'm choosing my meal by price more than by desire...I'm in a FTLT situation.  I can see how the place would appeal to a tourist, or to a black and gold anniversary dinner.  But as a regular haunt...not so much."}
{"text":"They play on the fact this place used to be a church. You can drink in the pews and there are beer kettles on the alter. It even has that old church smell. Their beer and food are good. The location is a little off the beaten path, but it's worth the trip for the experience."}
{"text":"A friend had told us about this spot and I'm glad we came! Literally a church converted into a brewery. We stopped by around 11 on a Saturday night and the place was absolutely dead. I guess it's more of a restaurant.   So we returned for brunch the next day. The beers were great. I was pretty impressed by the food too. I had a fabulous quinoa salad and my husband had a pizza with some amazing sauce on it.  Would definitely recommend. Just don't go too late!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Old church and high school (St. John the Batist) in the Bloomfield section of Pittsburgh, which now smells like a brewery.  Decent food and decent draft beer, but they were our of (real) IPA both times we visited.  They peddled something they called \"Belgian IPA,\" but it didn't have enough hops to taste.  They were out of their real IPA both on tap and in bottles both times we visited, about a week apart.    The atmosphere, food, and beer are all better than average, and that's a strong triad.  They also have sweet potato fries.  Despite the deceptive (deficit) IPA availability, we still ended up going twice during a 2 week visit to the \"burgh.  MEL"}
{"text":"I had SUCH a great experience here. The drinks were delicious and the food was great too! I was apprehensive about trying the pirogies but they were delicious and I am a very picky eater. You must try the flight if you like beer because they give you tons! The wait staff was super nice and the environment is so cool! The place is beautifully set up and the atmosphere is great. Also, when we got the bill I was shocked! Great prices for all we got! 40 bucks for 2 drinks, meal, and dessert. This is my #1 suggestions if you only have a night in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"What. A. Place. In all the cities I've eaten in, i have never come across a more unique venue.   The beers were great (try their IPA) and the food was better than described to me. The buffalo cauliflower is a must have. Will turn the biggest carnivore into a believer. It is spicyyyy- completely doused in buffalo sauce.   The shrimp and grits was decent but definitely not served southern style. The short ribs were comforting and the kind of dish I'd come back for when it's snowing outside."}
{"text":"Hungry for a late-night bite to eat after visiting friends and their brand new baby, we headed to Church Brew Works.  I'm a little obsessed with old historic buildings repurposed for new causes.  While it probably started with the old firehouse converted into mansion circa The Real World: Boston, I've always liked the idea of living or working in a historic place.  Church Brew Works, as its name implies, is a brewpub in an old church.  You're definitely struck by the unique setting when you walk in.  While the beer is great, they're also noted for good food.  We were starving, so we started with the Bison Corn Dogs, served with honey mustard, pickled veggies, and a chipotle ketchup.  They felt like saltier, meatier versions of state fair corn dogs, and I liked the subtle kick from the ketchup.  My absolute favorite part of the visit was the brick-oven pizza.  We chose the Garden Plum Tomato Pizza, which had garden plum tomato sauce, basil, garlic, olive oil, and some really fresh mozzarella.  The whole pizza tasted super fresh, and the ratio of cheese and sauce was spot on.  My favorite part was the crust.  They are used some beautiful dough here, because it was pretty much my ideal consistency for pizza... chewy, with a fluffy crust!"}
{"text":"Went here when I was first visiting Pittsburgh because I thought the concept was interesting. Walked in and was excited to see that they preserved the church look. The drawback is the drink and food menu. It reminds me of an ok pizza and brewery chain in California. Just wasn't what I was expecting, which could be entirely my fault. Will probably not be back here now that I live in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"What can be funnier than getting wasted in a Catholic church? At the site of the former altar stand large, gleaming stainless-steel brewing vats. Beer is the libation of choice, as five fresh-brewed ambers and ales are available at any given time. Other non-alcoholic drinks are also made in-house: namely, ginger ale and root beer. Furthermore, there's homemade ice cream using malt from the beer.  * The pizzas they serve are fantastic."}
{"text":"The inside of this place is really fun and unique, a really cool idea to convert a church. They have brewing tanks at the front which was quirky and fun to see. This place is huge with tons of bar and regular seating. Their rotating beers were good, we got 4 over our time there and enjoyed aspects of each one. They all had a unique aspect to them with different flavors and we really enjoyed that. The pricing for a beer was amazing but we are from the DC area!  The menu was large and things sounded good. We ordered perogies, the were only slight warmer than room temperature which was a huge disappointment. They were ok if they would have been heated properly, we wanted to experience a traditional dish and were let down. There was a huge amount of butter on the plate under them, not sure if that is traditional. The sauteed onions were also cold, the sour cream was served under them instead of on top/on the side for some reason.  What made it worse is that we were really early for dinner, only a few other tables were occupied when we ordered and a handful of people at the bar. Service was friendly but nothing special.   If I lived in the area I would go back for beer and the fun atmosphere but skip the food."}
{"text":"This is my first time going here. It was weird to enter the restaurant because we were unsure which of the doors to enter, but apparently you could enter any door. When you walk in you're like \"woah it's a f***ing church\" and then the smell hit me. I am not a beer person so I don't know if the onsite brewing had anything to do with the smell but, even though it was faint, it wasn't a good smell. After sitting there, my party and I, eventually got use to the smell. The architecture of the building was all left the same, so it was neat to look at while you were waiting. Our service was good, no complaints there. He was informative and patient and helped my sister with beer selections. He was able to recommend one for her, since she doesn't like beer all that much. The wait for the food was a little long, considering there wasn't a lot of people dining at the time we where there. The pierogies I got were f***ing awesome - can't curse in a church (; The fries were really good as well, which I snagged from my dad's meal. Oh, if you come here you should know that all the beers are made there and you cannot find outside companies. However, they do have other spirits offered from the bar. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Driving around Pittsburgh in search of the quintessential Pittsburgh dining experience, we motored past the Church Brew Works and had to stop. A church? An altar mounted with brewing equipment, producing luscious beers worthy of the Viking gods?   We hit the brakes and parked the car. I've never spent more than a few minutes in a church save for the requisite dull hum of a wedding ceremony, so I was rather amazed at the scale of the place. The literal cathedral ceiling, tables as far as the eye can see, a lone pizza man plying his trade just to the right of the altar, where beer was in process before being transferred to kegs or bottles and served at the restaurant. The church, oddly, has the feel of an Eastern European brewhouse; outside of the setting, it doesn't have much character or charm.  We ordered perogis and pizza. The perogis were good, but the pizza wasn't anything special. The crust was too sweet and too short, the sauce lack brightness or vigor, and the cheese just sat there, holding the whole thing together. The beer really stood out as the star of the show. I had the summer special hefeweizen, and my companion had the IPA x2. We loved them both.   This is definitely a must-see for anyone passing through town. Come for beers and atmosphere, but plan to have your dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"You walk up the stairs as if you are walking into Church on Sunday AM... and then all of a sudden.... BOOM it is a REAL LIFE Brewery in a CHURCH.  We had to wait a long time for a table at the prime of weekend dining -- 8pm Saturday night. Whatever, that is normal. No stars deducted for the hour and half wait.  The food was average, I was socked that they could get away with charging $15+ for dinner. I came for the atmosphere, not for the food.  The beer was great... what I expected for a brewery.... Creative names, good selection.  Great touristy place to visit.  FYI this place was EMPTY by 11pm when we left... Come for a late dinner?"}
{"text":"Whether it's a seasonal brew or my go to Celestial Gold, I always have a good beer.  The pizza is always phenomenal, I usually get the pesto pizza, but I've had numerous and they are all great!  To top it all off, the setting is just plain old awesome."}
{"text":"What a neat concept - a brewery and restaurant in an old church. Feels so wrong but yet so good.  Not only the ambiance but the beer is why you should come. As for the food, it is mediocre and a bit bland so would suggest passing on a meal there. If you are looking for a quiet spot too this might not be the place for you as the noise does echo throughout the building."}
{"text":"I love going to the Church. The ambiance alone is worth it. The beer is made fresh on the Altar and the Pizza is amazing. I recommend the Pirogi pizza with bacon."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is one of my favorite destinations in Pittsburgh. Easily 5 stars for ambience as the repurposed church is gorgeous and offers several interesting seating locations. The beer is excellent and should please both craft lovers and casual beer drinkers. What I admire most is that CBW could probably get by with mediocre food because of the location and beer alone, but the food is also incredible. I've had variations of a cheesesteak several times and have always been impressed. They also have great salad and pizza options too!"}
{"text":"If all the churches are set up with a couple of beer brewing tanks, I bet you my friend would go to church every week....   Church Brew Works just look like a church from the outside. I definitely got fool by its exterior appearances. But when I was walking down the aisle, I know I have come to the right place!  I am always really into churches, love all these stained glass windows, the stone vaulted ceiling, and the Altar.   Sitting at the benches sampling a beer flight of 8 ($12.75) and eating some Traditional Pierogies ($6.50) was definitely enjoyable experience.   I definitely will be back for the beer, beer is definitely better than food?!   Ample parking at the back of the Church, make sure you have a designated driver!"}
{"text":"I was told that this spot was a \"must try\", but that's probably not the case if you're not a huge fan of beer. The food menu wasn't the most impressive thing I've seen, and the burger I ordered was good, at best. But the beer selection there is unmatched by too many other places. And it's very interesting the way they've transformed the church into a brewery. Ultimately, it's a cool place to check out just to say you did it."}
{"text":"great food. one of the most unique locations i have been to. beer is above average. the whole experience is amazing. I will always be coming back to this place, unless they turn it into a church again....."}
{"text":"Beer was good Food was decent but not extraordinary.  Converting a place of worship into a brewery is the best thing I can think of doing to a house of worship."}
{"text":"Whenever someone comes to visit Pittsburgh this is where I take them. The space is as unique as you can find anywhere. The food is delicious and creative and the beer has never let me down. They are always updating for the season and keep a nice roster of old favorites and new creations when it comes to food and drink. It is not a cheap place, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Beer on a pedestal, at first it sounds very pittsburgh-y. But after skimming the main menu and receiving four very lonely pierogies on my large plate, I'm thinking the owners were pushing for a french brasserie rather than a neighborhood beer happy joint.   I will say that the waiter was great and the architecture and lighting is beautiful. Unfortunately you can see the poor pizza boy slaving away in the corner to the right of the brass tanks, stuffing dough into the wood-fired oven, trapped in a metal cubicle of cheese and toppings.  In the ladies room you can imagine the place where the anxious bride awaited, with her gown on the faded salmon carpet. More renovations await as well I hope."}
{"text":"You can't beat the atmosphere in this old cathedral. The food is decent and attitude of the staff can be hit or miss, but it's generally pretty good. But the building is the focal point. If it were anywhere else they would need to take the service and food up a couple notches.  We came in an hour before closing  (which is 11 pm) and the host was not happy to see us, but our waiter was cool and made up for it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The best part is obviously because it's an old church and really pretty inside! They also have really good food and awesome specials like rattlesnake pierogies and plantain sandwiches. Yum!"}
{"text":"I LOVE CHURCH! I heard a lot of good things about this brewery. Granted that I am not a beer drinker, i decided to check it out since the food critics on here made it seem good. I'm happy that I listened. The decor is kind of shocking because it is a church indeed w/ beer everywhere BUT once you try the food, all of that goes out the window. One word: AMAZING! Church is a place that is cool to hang out on a Weekend night w/ friends to just kick back & relax. I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"A completely different experience than a few years ago! I'm not sure if they changed the chef, but whatever they did it's a great change. For appetizer we got the artichoke dip and it was perfectly delicious. I had the cheesesteak sandwich, also yummy. I should have gotten the brick oven pizza, I stole a piece of my dad's and it was soooooo freaking delicious! It was a special occasion so we ended up getting desserts to split between all of us and everything was perfect. Tiramisu and the chocolate cake are a must, make sure to save room!   It was a great experience and we will definitely go back! Oh yea.,. And you're dining in a church! Awesome atmosphere, an experience like nothing else in Pittsburgh. Definitely a must if you have out of town guests."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous place. We chose to eat on the patio out back, which was a good call due to the slightly-loud interior. Such a lovely and unique dining spot, with great food and an awesome beer menu.   I loved my super-fat salad, with fries, melted Jack cheese and buffalo chicken tenders on it; my favourite when-in-America dish, indulgent and tasty, with two buckets of dressing on the side. The perogies were pretty nice, well-filled and solid. I also really liked the spinach dip with smoked Gouda, as a shared appetizer.   Note that this place is out in the middle of nowhere, relatively, so plan ahead; we waited for a cab for quite some time."}
{"text":"This place is such a unique restaurant. The atmosphere is truly amazing and it makes for a fun dining experience. Church Brew Works has both great food and great drinks. The servers really know the menu and are great with finding beer pairings to match your food and your taste preference. I always make sure to grab a meal here when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"What a fun experience! I don't know if I've ever again say that I got to drink beer and eat pizza \"at church\".  You walk in the place and it's basically an old, beautiful church, stained glass and everything - turned restaurant. Everyone at our table started with drinks. I can't remember the name of my drink, but it was something like coffee liquor with cinnamon. Came with whipped cream on top and decorated with an actual cinnamon stick. I'm a sucker for cute drinks, and for coffee, so this was awesome. I'm not a big beer drinker, but I liked the IPA that others at my table got.  The pizza was also delicious. One was chicken and pineapple - pretty good. The other was artichoke, spinach, and feta. LOVED that one!  I recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area, just for the experience!"}
{"text":"Controlled chaos. Two words which pretty much sum up my Church Brew works experience .    When you first walk in it is complete chaos. You cannot tell how to get a table, where to wait, or what to do. I strongly recommend the Yelp waitlist before you go.     Drinks were ok. But Word to the wise!! if you order a Moscow Mule, they will take your drivers license to make sure you don't steal the copper mugs. I suggest to just get the drink in a regular glass.      The food was Hit and miss. We ordered the homemade potato chips, which were burnt. We had a basket of fries, which were greasy and tepid.     My quesadilla, however, was great. It was a shrimp and avocado quesadilla with some kind of pineapple salsa relish on the top. The fresh jalapeños in the pineapple salsa complemented the shrimp and avocado inside the quesadilla wonderfully.     A great restaurant for hipsters who  drink IPA beer. Way too chaotic for date night or for a family night out."}
{"text":"The setting is gorgeous.  The beer is good.  And the jambalaya is nice and spicy."}
{"text":"My wife and I have really wanted to go to church for awhile now.  Church Brew Works that is!  We even came here earlier in the year but it was so busy that we couldn't find a place to sit so we left and went somewhere else.  This time we lucked out and found a spot at the bar on a late Saturday afternoon.  Unfortunately our seats were at the very corner of the bar next to a cold wall.  The bartender didn't greet us at first but she did give us their drink menu.  We ordered our drinks and a little bit later a few more spots in the middle of the large bar area opened up and we moved and felt a lot more comfortable there.  I felt overall that the bartenders were good too and provided good customer service to us.    It's a really beautiful place in inside.  The atmosphere was great and it really enhanced the drinking and conversation experience with my wife and I.  Which is key in a marriage right?! It was very enjoyable once we got settled in.  We didn't get to try any of their food but we did have an imaginary dinner.  We picked out a few things that we would eat if we would have dined here and when we eventually come back.  It's a good food menu.    My wife loves IPA's and she found a good IPA to drink here. She had their ThunderHop.  They still had their Oktoberfest out so I ordered that for my first drink.  I've had it before in a bottle and I really enjoyed it and it was even better as a draft.  For my second and third drink I ordered their Christmas beer.  In the description it mentions that it was like eating a cookie but it wasn't sweet like that.  I tasted a sample at first and it was a good winter beer taste and not sweet.  We stayed here for a few hours and really enjoyed ourselves.  If you can get here when it's not too busy that's the best time to go.  Like I said the first time that we tried to come here you either had to wait a long time for a table or stand to wait for a bar seat.    So if you want to have a good time at church come to Church Brew Works and you wont be disappointed!  Church Time!"}
{"text":"Love the beer and unique atmosphere. This really is a one of a kind place that I highly suggest coming to if you like beer. The building is an old church and declared a historic landmark. They brew a variety of beer here, which makes it a fun trip for a beer lover. Typically I think the food is good, however I never had a dish that I would specifically make the trip for. On my most recent visit the service was inconsistent however the waitress was very nice. If it gets pretty busy the noise can carry oddly and make it hard to hear. They have something on the menu for everyone but it can get pretty pricey for some items. I like that food items that have some Pittsburgh flair to them, which really adds to the experience. Also, the bar has seasonal cocktails and offers mixed drinks and wine in addition to their in house brews."}
{"text":"Hey there fellow Yelpers!!  If you are in Pittsburgh, this place is just incredible. Let's start with the place itself. The church was built in 1903 and is declared a historic site. Inside, most of the original decor of the church remains. The old church organ pipes remain in the balcony of this historic site and what I like most is the stained glass windows. By the way, most of these historic Catholic Windows site above huge steel drum vats of custom beer.  I haven't decided if this is sac-religious. . The old altar holds several vats of beer and the actual system that creates their brews.  It is amazing. I have pictures to share.   Now, the beer!! I tried a coconut and strawberry brew. Now, this was not some sweet concoction and in fact it wasn't served with a normal tapper and keg system. It was a pump system that was served a little on the room temperature side and it was fantastic. This craft local brew was not sweet, it was dark but not heavy and had a nice nutty aroma to it. I'm no beer connoisseur, but I loved this experience and the fact that it was slightly warm made my beer tasting experience very enjoyable.   The food: We ordered pizza. Now, you might be thinking, really??? Did I mention they have a wood fire oven!!!!???   Yes, they do! And the big thing is this. The pizza is great!! Phenomenal. Unreal!! Out of bounds as Guy would say. Now, we created a cool concoction.  A pepperoni, green peppers, and lamb sausage pizza.  The green peppers were cut thin, which I enjoyed as it was not too much of the peppers and just the right amount. The lamb sausage was incredible. This was one amazing pizza!! Seriously!! You will not find a better pizza. My colleague at work never had pirogies. Really? Dude, you are kidding me? So, we ordered two apps, traditional and Pittsburgh-ized. The non-traditional had a horseradish based inside and were amazing!!  Now, at this point you might be thinking, this review is pretty great, why just 4 stars? Well, dessert was awful!! We each ordered bread pudding which Had a bourbon sauce with it.  The bread was some crappy frozen concoction that was simply awful!! I didn't think the dessert justified dropping this place to a 3 star. I thought that was unfair.   Bread pudding is one of my top 2 desserts.  You have some flexibility with me when it comes to preparing it but this was clearly a crappy joke of a dessert.    Please, please, please make your own from scratch. It isn't that hard and you can do so much better.   Yelpers, despite the dessert disaster, this place is an absolute must see and experience!!! Trust me!! Order the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Voted Pittsburgh's best eatery many years in a row. This old Roman Catholic church turned brewery/restaurant had great ales and specialty brews, an extensive wine list, a huge vodka selection and the best menu in western Pennsylvania. The brick oven pizzas are incredible with imaginative toppings.  Try a sampling of all the beers including the bottled fresh Thundergod IPA, and the Pius monk dunkle. All of the stained glass windows are intact and all of the tables and bar stools were fabricated from the church pews. The outdoor patio area reminds me of eating outdoors in Germany. One is completely surrounded by red brick ivy covered walls. I've had friends from New York, Vancouver, and Toronto visit Pittsburgh and I've taken them here for dinner and they all had a great time. They also have said that the Church Brew Works is a one of a kind place and only Pittsburgh could pull it off."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people and we had friendly, fast, and attentive service. Prices were a little high. We got the Fried Pickles and weren't expecting pickle spears but they were still good. We also just had to try the Rattlesnake and seared Cactus Pierogies. Yes, you hear that right! They were actually pretty good, and I'm glad to say I've tried rattlesnake and liked it! For the entree I got the Potato Pirogies with Buffalo Chicken ($25 and there was about 5?)  The Pierogies were good but I don't think the buffalo sauce wen't to well with it. They seemed a little on the homemade side but $25 is still crazy to me for that. There was so much seating in here I don't know how the kitchen does it."}
{"text":"The beer has made a huge improvement! Try the coconut milk stout, it's amazing."}
{"text":"What a cool concept. I like what they did with the place. The beer was delightful and the food was tasty.  I recommend the pierogies they are really yummy."}
{"text":"Some parts of me really loves it here, but I will tell you after my last experience I'm not sure that I will go back. The ambiance is really cool, so there's that. It's a unique experience being in an old church drinking your beer. With that being said, I do enjoy their beers! If only they put that much love into their food. It's also one of the convenient places to go in the city because it has a parking lot. Anyway, our waiter had a pretty bad attitude and our food took FOREVER! After waiting for about an 1 1/2 hours we finally got our dinner at 9 pm. Mine was decent, but another member of our party ordered a hot sandwich was straight up cold. He politely asked to have the hot sandwich he ordered and the waiter unhappily took it back saying they will remake it. Well their \"remake\" all of a sudden came back out a minute later clearly microwaved because it was still cold in the middle. We all just continued on with our meals at this point because we were hungry. For the cost of the food this is just ridiculous. After the super slow service and being there way longer than we wanted and needed to be we were ready to leave. There are so many better places to eat and drink in Pittsburgh these days and Church brew Works has not kept up with the level of competition in the area now. So I'd head elsewhere to spend you money because the food and service is not worth it here!"}
{"text":"The service here was terrible and the waitress was pretty rude to is the whole time and made me feel uncomfortable about wanting the whole menu after they went to only pizza and beer. The pizza was okay but I want impressed especially since it took a really long time to come out and we were almost the only people there. Scenery is great though in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Pierogies and Sweet potato fries, awesome. Beer, good. Flight was good to order with nice sized portions. Location is original and a must visit while in Pitts."}
{"text":"I have been to Church Brew Works twice now when visiting friends in Pittsburgh and I wish that I could magically transport this place to New York.  It's a cool concept, but I can see how it could have gone horribly wrong and been really cheesy - thankfully, this is not the case at all.  I absolutely love the feel of the restaurant, especially the stained glass.  The servers are knowledgeable about their beers and happy to offer suggestions (I went with the excellent Celestial Gold).  We started out with pierogies, which were nothing short of phenomenal - order them, they are a life-changing level of good.  I also had the Shinkasa cheesesteak (Kobe beef, grilled onions and red peppers, and melted provolone), which was quite tasty.  All around a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Great venue. Hence the 4 stars.  2 hour wait?! I had high expectations for the food. Food was nothing spectacular. Had the mushroom pesto pizza, which was good. Again, nothing special for the price and wait for a seat. I was excited to try the curried pumpkin soup with spicy shrimp and cilantro crema. I was hoping it would have been more pumpkin than curry. The curry was a bit overpowering so I felt like I was literally eating curry. :/  My beer was delish and worth it. Home brews and brewed well! I think they're all great."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to check out Church Brew Works; the idea of a restaurant housed in an old church is very interesting to me. Unfortunately, I felt that my expectations were high and the atmosphere and experience fell short in the end.  I came to Church Brew Works with a couple of friends on a Friday night. We were expecting to have a long wait, but as a pleasant surprise we were able to be seated right away. As I mentioned before, Church Brew Works is inside of an old renovated church, which is a very hip idea. If you look up towards the altar, you see all of the brewing equipment for the beer. I like that the owners made an attempt to preserve the original feel of the church while also renovating it to a point that it feels new and interesting. At the same time, I feel that the decor could be a little bit more extensive. The owners had a major opportunity to make this one of the coolest and trendiest restaurants around, but I didn't feel a wow factor when I walked in.  We decided to order a couple appetizers, as we weren't extremely hungry but were looking for more of a snack. I will say that the food is a step above the traditional pub food I was expecting. We ordered the pork tostadas, the gouda and artichoke dip, and the French fries. The tostadas were a little cold when they arrived, but the flavors were nice. They kind of had a zesty Mexican taste to them. The gouda and artichoke dip was probably my favorite app that we ordered, and I would get it again. I do wish the dip was bigger though, as we had a lot of chips left over at the end and no dip for them. The French fries were surprisingly pretty good, and they came with a roasted red pepper sauce on the side that we all enjoyed much more than ketchup.  Overall, the food was better than I expected but also a bit pricey for simple small appetizers. I love the idea of the restaurant, but the execution was a little lacking for me. I don't think I would necessarily rush back to Church Brew Works anytime soon. However, I have heard very good things about the pizza here, so I would like to come back at some point to try it out!"}
{"text":"I enjoy beer.  Real beer.  Not the watered-down megabrews that so many people somehow enjoy.  I've currently had only 6 of Church Brew Works beers, but they've so far been very underwhelming.  I will keep trying in the hopes that I can find a winner and bump up the star rating.  On that note, I don't think I'll ever be back for the food.  My table of 7 started with a pizza...and probably should have stopped there.  One friend got a steak hoagie that was basically salt-crusted, another got jambalaya that was oversalted and inedible, my girlfriend got a sandwich that was average at best, I got an overcooked buffalo burger...you get the idea.  And it's definitely not cheap; for Pittsburgh it's more on the expensive side.    If you go, ask someone what the best beer on tap is, give it a go, and get a pizza.  Skip the regular menu."}
{"text":"Heard about this place for a while, and finally got the chance to check it out.  The atmosphere of the Church is very fun.  It's like a German beer garden.  We went on a sat and it was fun and loud.   They have about 7-10 different beers to try. It's all open so all the beer tanks are inside the main seating.  No comment on the food though .  It's a really cool addition to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The staff here is super friendly.  The beer selection was really good too. The food was amazing! We sampled a little of everything but the onion soup was absolutely ridiculous good."}
{"text":"Pierogi pizza. Need I say more? I love the overall \"comfort food\" feel of this place. The grandeur of the venue paired with just an incredibly filling menu will leave you feeling very, very full.  Perfect for a large group, but try to make reservations, since it fills up on weekends. Beer flights allow you to try the different brews. And be sure to snap some photos on the BEER ALTER! No really, their stainless steel tanks of beer on the alter. Truly a Pittsburgh institution, and a must for out-of-towners."}
{"text":"Their beer is great, no denying that.   Food is not. The pierogies all taste like Mrs. T's and often take the \"oh it's a wacky pairing\" approach that justifies skimping on both flavor and portion size. Eight dollars for four pierogies is hilarious.   Also they sued the city over having to give their employees sick days. So if you want to risk your server, bartender, or cook being sick but not being able to take off work for fear of losing their job, it's for you!"}
{"text":"Just got back from Pittsburgh for work, and enjoyed many of the restaurants the city had to offer.  This one especially, which we visited twice on our one week stay. Yah, one can say it's sacriligious to drink beer in a building that was once used as a Catholic Church, but I think God has a sense of humor too! The building is beautiful, stained glass windows, and the alter used as a brewery.  The restaurant brews their own beer on site, and has many options, ones I've never tried before. I ordered a beer similiar to a budlight. The food is delicious!! We had the spinach dip and pita bread as an appetizer, and the vegetarian pizza and fish sandwhich as entrees. Both were very tasty and the portions were humungous. Definitely not somewhere to go if you are on a diet, even if you order a salad, everywhere in Pittsburgh they put french fries on their salads!! Weird. The service was great both times we went. Very helpful and informative of the city and the restaurant. I even purchased the beer glasses that said \"And on the 8th day, man created beer!\" I would defintely recommend this place if you are ever in the area, and feeling a little adventurous :-)"}
{"text":"Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.     I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.  We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.    When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)   After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes.   The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.  No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).  FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.  I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.  Oh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.     First and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.   There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great. Pizzas are ridiculously good. Beer is great. Pious monk dunkel, all I have to say. Seasonal and special brews are great, too."}
{"text":"Excellent way to convert an old church! Beautiful inside and awesome food. Great wait staff. Only downside a little noisy. Did I mention it has great beer!"}
{"text":"There are so many amazing tasting rooms and breweries popping up in Pittsburgh and Church is holding steady with their service, food and some of the best beverages one could want."}
{"text":"The first time I planned on eating at this restaurant, there wasn't a parking spot for miles. We drove right past the place and went to Hofbrauhaus instead. Much better choice. The second time I came here, there was a parking spot and a shorter wait time but the food was mediocre and the service was terrible. The food took forever to come out and the waiter probably checked on us twice. This restaurant really doesn't live up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Good food and beer - what more could you ask for! Sampled all available beers, cheese plate with meat and chicken and brie sandwich. All good."}
{"text":"First of all these guys are like the pioneers of the Pittsburgh craft beer movement.   Cool concept, good beer, and decent food.  I remember coming here last time I was in the 'Burgh 5 or 6 years ago and I feel like I had a much higher opinion of it that time around.  Not that there was anything wrong this go round I just feel like the gastro pub scene has really stepped up its game in the past few years and these guys have remained pretty much the same.  Worth a visit if your in town for a few days, if for nothing else than the photo op of the fermentation vessels in the alter!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people really love this place, but I can't stand it.   I literally can't go there anymore because of the smell. I know it's because of the brewery and the yeast they use for the beer. But ugh....I can't shake it. I smell it when I come in, I smell it when I eat and I smell it on me after I leave.   It's such a shame too because the place is just gorgeous! Obviously, it used to be a church and they've kept a lot of the original stain glass windows. Even the pews and tables you sit at are originally from the church.   I.just.can't.take.the.smell.   Also, I'm not really a fan of the beer they brew. I've tried it a bunch of times and it just never seems to stand out for me. The food is not bad either. I've had the pizza's, which are offered in a variety of different types. I seriously just can't take the smell.   I'm sure I'll get talked into going again sometime, but hopefully it's in the summer when I can sit outside. The outside does have a great set up. Plus, you don't have the smell.   I'm sure the point has come across the smell wasn't there I'd probably not mind the place. It doesn't bother my friends as much as it bothers me, so maybe I'll just chalk it up to having a strong sense of smell.  I'm totally ok with that when it's good smelling things, I swear!"}
{"text":"Amazing bread pudding best I ever had.  Beautiful stained glass.  Wait staff was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab a beer or three. Beer sampler was the way to go, every beer on tap and  3-4 oz each. Food was not a bright spot and staff at the pub side was a bit overwhelmed and unfocused."}
{"text":"Twister, a fantastic movie showing the true power of mother nature along with the splendid acting of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. Who can forget the moment they survived an F5 tornado due to the sturdiness of a belt. I am 99% positive leather belt sales skyrocketed in the tornado alley region that year.   Who knew that the sometimes dastardly mother nature was also able to make an appearance within Pittsburgh itself? The Church Brew Works is a twister of dark Belgian flavors and delicious edibles making for a destructive good time in ones taste buds.  Like the dark clouds rolling in during a storm, the Church Brew Works has dim lighting which really works with it's church like atmosphere.  Last evening I tried the southwest wrap which really was a cyclone of flavor that dances along the roof of your mouth and slides into your stomach to make a splash of satisfaction. The sweet potato fries refuse to be bullied by its larger counterpart, the cyclone and make a bold statement of sweet goodness that will in fact explode on ones tongue as it creates fireworks of sensational prowess (Yes I said prowess).  But alas I bring you to the beer. The decision was made to try the seasonal due to the festivities that are afoot with Christmas. The Biere De Noel is a lightning storm of electric charged bolts that will pierce through the frowns of any person to find them joy despite their Grinch like nature. The only issue with this storm of a beer is that you will want more than you should have. A designated driver is recommended on this twister of a tale my friends.   In conclusion, twister is a great movie but more more importantly The Church Brew Works is the sequel. That is all."}
{"text":"The church itself is absolutely stunning and it blows you away as soon as you walk in. The food is good, not exceptional but good - try the Mexican pizza if you are a vegetarian. Our party was split on whether or not we liked the pierogie pizza. The beer is nothing to write home about - but everything else made it a great spot to stop by as we drove through Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great place great atmosphere!  Was a Sunday afternoon so was fairly low key but loved the atmosphere inside (not to mention the a/c, a necessity for me being from Seattle).  Food was great - only complaint is I ordered a beer that was supposed to be some type of \"blueberry\" beer - didn't taste a hint of blueberry, only beer.  Friendly staff and nice place."}
{"text":"Called for a reservation on Saturday at 2 in the afternoon..was told they stopped taking reservations for the day. Decided to take a shot and go there at 530 and was able to get seated right away with no wait and plenty of tables open. Ordered some samples of bear and food. Food came before we received our beers that we chose after trying the samples.  Was told that certain bears were not available in bottles later to find out after dinner they were. Ordered a bottle to go and it took 20 minutes to get to us...then another 10 minutes to have our credit card get taken for the bottle of beer....the food was cold as well and the soup was not hot but pretty warm.  Nope.. Sorry you lost us as customers."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place to anyone who has not been here yet. The venue is quite unique as you can imagine, and it is an experience you don't want to miss out on whether you are a local or just visiting the area. I tried the pizza last night, and it was very good, as were the appetizers I have tried in the past. The service was also good. That being said, I would not make this place my go-to spot unless you tend to regularly go out with large groups. The venue is the best part of the experience, and there is no need to re-experience it on a regular basis."}
{"text":"A lot's been written, so I'll try to be brief.  I was here on Saturday with a couple friends, place was packed but found ample seating at the bar.  The space is gorgeous, high ceilings, organ, pipes, stained glass, etc.  This place has outdoor seating, however I always seem to forget.  It has delicious brick oven pizza, with fresh sauce, and perfectly cooked cheese.  I only wish their crust was thinner.  The wine selection sucks, but the spirits offered are pretty ample.  They won't offer samples of the cask conditioned, which is okay because all there beer is pretty good and they offer samples of all the rest.  The stout was below average.  I had their \"kobe\" steak sandwich, for $11,,, really?? \"kobe\"?? Either way, perfecty acceptable sandwich and the sweet potato fries are a nice touch.  Friend had the salmon, she said it was delicious and cooked perfectly.  We tried the brie, which was about c level brie with nice breading and figs (nice touch!), the non-traditional perogies were no good, overcooked, overpriced and underflavored.  The service was better than most.  The bathrooms were big enough, with no lines that I saw, which was surprising with so much beer being drunk,,, Oh well, I guess it's not possible for me to write a short review.  There's always next time."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I was just there last night and ordered something so genius. Perogie pizza. It was amazing! It took about 20-25 minutes but it was so worth the wait. If you like perogies you will probably love this pizza. Plus the atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome and different. It's a cool place to go that's unique and fun with all their beer selections!"}
{"text":"It was our second trip. We make it a point to eat here now when in town. The food is as good as the atmosphere and their craft beers are a must if your in town. The service is fantastic even on super busy nights (this trip was a slower night). Try the cheesesteak (better than anything I had in Philly and I grew up in Delaware and lived there for 30 years). One tip is to expect a wait of 45-60 minutes on a normal busy night."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Church Brew Works. The collapse of the steel industry in Pittsburgh left quite a few parishes without a congregation and led to the creation of this very unique brewery. How often do you get do drink beer in a church? The fermentation tanks are literally at the alter. Something about the combination feels so wrong that it is right.  Apart from the atmosphere, the beer here is great stuff. Grab a sampler to try them all, each had its merit. It's looks like you can grab growlers and mini kegs as well. Certainly worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful. The architecture is to die for. I love that they took an old church at made it a brewery. It is SO large and such a fun environment. I love that you can see the brewery at work here.   Their service was very friendly where we had up to 3 bartenders helping out. We absolutely loved their beer. I LOVED their sour and newest beers like the Berliner Weisse ad the Bazaar Berliner. They also have a Tropical Paraweisse which is scrumptious. Absolutely make a stop! It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is one of those places you go to just to say 'Hey I went to this brewery which is inside of a church!' Granted I didn't eat here, but it seems like traditional sort of fair. Me and the other half came to grab a beer and a martini. Good prices, nothing flashy. It was fun to take a look of the remnants of the past, but I don't think it would be a place I would come time and time again. It was a fun stop, and I recommend just to grab a drink and take a look in"}
{"text":"Great beer selection (including a draft on Cask) and overall moderate to good quality of their own crafted beers.  Beer prices are fair.  Location isn't great, but the interior / decoration / idea of a bar inside a church is tremendously appealing.  The stained glass windows and rustic feel of the old building really separates church brew from it's local Pittsburgh competition. Food was mediocre and overpriced.  Worth visiting for a drink, but I would likely pass if just looking for food."}
{"text":"Came here during a business trip in Pittsburgh.  It's definitely a site to see, regardless of whether or not your a beer fan.  The old church building is cool and they have off street, free parking.  I went right after a business meeting so I made it there for happy hour.  I sat at the bar and had some spinach and artichoke dip, 2 slices of pizza and a sampler of their beers.  By far my favorite brew was the Tripple.  Nothing else really stood out.  They had another section for more formal dining.  I was wearing jeans and dressed casually but I didn't feel out of place in the bar.  The staff was not very friendly and the bartender spent more time talking to coworkers than helping people.  If I lived in Pittsburgh this is not a place that I would frequent, however if you're passing by it's something really unique that should not be missed."}
{"text":"Started off date night with a stop at the Church. My husband and I hadn't been there for awhile and were really interested in the seasonal and specialty brews. The bartender was able to provide a flight of most of them, which was not standard - very appreciated.   The beers were unique, but not awesome, and one of them came in a glass that hadn't been rinsed thoroughly; it tasted like dishwasher soap. We both know beer, and this wasn't right. It wasn't some kind of cilantro beer or anything.  We ordered the homemade chips, which were delightful, before setting off to the next destination."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Pittsburgh. I friggin love the ambiance, the beer, the food, and the service. Never, never, never had a problem. I love pierogies and they make awesome ones. Everyday they have a special \"untraditional\" pierogie. Get them!! The boar quesadilla was pretty good and so was the cinco fromaggio pizza. The staple beers are great. The Cherry Quadzilla is amazing and the staff will usually tell you three truth about the quality of the batches. The Sour Piet is also very good if you like sour beers. I've only ever been here in the winter but the winter seasonals have been good. I'm so glad somebody did something with this church. It's gorgeous on the inside and I heard a rumor that the bar is made out of the old pews. Of course where the altar of is where the magic happens. Finally their loot is cool looking. I really like their design on their shirts and glasses. Hafta to check this place out."}
{"text":"Beer are good and the atmosphere is excellent, a must see as it's in an old church converted into restaurant & brewery. I was not impressed with the food. The French onion soup was too salty, although the fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Cool venue but the food was WAY overpriced for the quality. Cost $95 ($80 + $15 tip) for 1 app, 2 entrees, 1 side, 1 dessert, 1 beer and 1 cocktail. Ordered Rattlesnake and Cactus Pierogie app; it was very bland and fairly boring for as exciting as it sounded. Shrimp and Grits entree was so disappointing. $25 for a cold schmear of flavorless wallpaper paste with 8 shrimp plopped on top. Drizzle on some \"Cajun\" (NOT!) sauce and a crapton of some sproutlike plants, and there you have it. They should have read my review of \"Reel\" in Woodstock, GA for a lesson in how S&G should be done! Dessert of banana bread pudding tasted like it was made a few days ago and popped in the microwave.   Our server, Brett, was super. We waited about 10 minutes after being seated before anyone talked to us, but I think that was due to the hostess, since Brett came over to us immediately after seeing us then talking to her.   Beer was great (as it SHOULD have been, seeing this is a brewery) and the cocktail was fun. Seriously though, the highlight of a hundred buck dinner should NOT be the booze. Just sayin'!  Oh! And while the entrance is handicapped accessible, there are 6 stairs INSIDE the restrooms to get to the stalls. WTF?  Bottom line: Go somewhere else. Like Burgatory at Robins Crossing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. On the outside it looks like it is just an average church. Then, you walk inside and discover the beauty it really is. It is a brewery and restaurant. The beer was ok, but the real star was a dish my boyfriend and i got on the suggestion of a friend: the buffalo chicken pierogi. What a masterpiece! The buffalo chicken sauce was so creamy and the right amount of spicy. The pierogi were just right, too. Also, the bartender was super nice. Need to go back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding beer, great staff, and the food was 5 star!  This was our first food stop in Pittsburgh, for 3 days.  May even come back here tomorrow...!"}
{"text":"The Church Brew Works has a lot to like. The church architecture gives it a special ambiance. I used to live in the Czech Republic and CBW reminded me of some of the old buildings there which had been turned into restaurants and pubs.    Their beers are good. Their hefeweizen and (currently) their coconut stout are exceptional.  Everything else? Sort of underwhelms me. The food is pricey but the quality is sub-par. I've been there several times in the last year, and tried everything from the soups to the sandwiches to the pizza.   Yesterday I had the lobster bisque, some of my friend's thai wings, and a slice of the mushroom pesto pizza. The bisque wasn't worth the $7 I paid for it. The wings were good, but not great. I thought the pizza was salty and rather bland tasting overall.  I've had other pizzas that were better in the past (from the CBW), but again. They aren't anything spectacular.   The service really varies. I've gone there during a weekday and had to wait forever. Other times, the waitstaff was spectacular.   So in a nutshell:  Positives: Good beer, nice environment.   Negatives: Food quality and price."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of time and this place is definitely a unique spot in Pittsburgh. A fun place to take out of towners or if you're looking for something a little different. Besides how loud it is on a busy night, I enjoy the atmosphere inside. The huge, old converted church lends itself to a restaurant better than you think it would. The alter was converted to the brewing area and the rest of the place is filled with tables and old church pews for some of the seating. They have a huge bar on one side and a wood fire pizza oven on the other. They also have an enclosed patio area for the nice weather.   The downfalls of this place are not in the fun decor but in the food and drinks. Everything I've consumed other than pizza is just .. okay.  They only serve the beer they brew in house, which limits the variety and quality you can choose from. When it comes to food they do have a lot of different options, but everything is divided on 2 food menus then a separate drink menu. Our table is always filled with tons of giant menus and it's just crowded. During our most recent visit we ordered chicken lettuce wraps and sweet potatoes fries to snack on. They were both good enough, but the lettuce wraps were $12 for a very small amount of chicken and some veggies to put in the wrap. The pizzas are definitely one of their best dishes, however due to a recent fire they will not be serving them for quite awhile!"}
{"text":"I have to give the owners the award for the most creative place to put a brewery and restaurant.    I am big into craft brews these days and this place looked like my kind of church.  Reminds me of my favorite church, the Church of the Bloody Mary.  But wait, this is about beer...  The place is huge as you would expect from an old church and a Catholic one, no less.  I stepped in on a Friday afternoon between lunch and dinner time and the place was quite dead.  So I settled in at the bar.    Some of the beer tanks were located right behind the bar which was on the left side of the \"church\".  The rest of it was in the old altar.  The old pew areas were converted into table seating areas for the restaurant.   They even used the old pews for some of the seating. Very creative.  As for the beer, they had 10 beers on tap which is a lot for a craft brewery.  I started out with a sampler that included 8 of those 10.  All of the beers were served almost warm.  Well it was hot outside and I was looking for a cold beer so I guess the church didn't come with refrigeration or maybe that's how the Catholics liked their beer - warm.  Anyway, none of them really impressed me.  So I was looking at the beer menu and saw the Cherry Quadzilla that I had not tried yet.  That is not part of the sampler because of the higher alcohol content.  They let me sample this and that was the beer I fell in love with here.  I am not normally into fruit flavored beers but there's something about Cherry beers that I enjoy.  Never had one I didn't like.  Just wish they had the Thundergod IPA on tap that some of the other reviewers mentioned.  Oh well.    I didn't stay to eat here but their menu looked interesting.  The perogie dish is something I would like to try someday if I ever make it back here.    For beer, I give this a 3.  Because out of 10 beers, you'd think I'd enjoy more than one.  For Atmosphere, I give it a 5.  Who would have thought to put a brewery in a church?  Rating average...4."}
{"text":"We recently took a group of 12 girls here. The waitress was very accommodating and let us have separate checks. The food was a big let down. The portions were very tiny and nothing tasted fresh. I also was surprised by the prices. The salads were $15-$18. I was really disappointed because I used to really enjoy this place and love their pizza."}
{"text":"Church Brewer Works is a very unique restaurant with excellent services. Food is excellent and delicious. Beer is pretty good, too.  My only complaint is that there are very few selections for lunch menu."}
{"text":"This place is great. It is cool how they turned a church into a brew pub. The pom frites are awesome and the pizza is good."}
{"text":"The ambience is awesome, but I thought the food and beer were really lacking.  We had the rattlesnake (the special) and potato and cheese pierogies.  The crust was  thick and chewy--not my favorite pierogie crust.  The fillings weren't great either.  The rattlesnake was similar to chicken in taste and blandness.  The potato was lackluster as well...I've had way better potato pierogies from the grocery store.  My husband tried the beer sampler, and while he found the beers pretty agreeable, I couldn't find a single one that pleased my taste buds.  I normally like wheat and slightly fruity beers, so that could be why...take my beer opinion with a grain of salt.  My entree was the mussels, which were cooked in beer.  Sadly I didn't enjoy those because the beer they were cooked in had a bitter/hoppy taste...meh.  My friend's pizza was pretty tasty, so I think pizza is the way to go for food here.  It was an interesting place to check out while I was in town, but with average food, service and pricing, I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and appetizers. Got the flight, edamame, and bruschetta. Beer was decent, edamame was out of this world (if you love garlic, you'll love the edamame), and the bruschetta and nicely done and refreshing. There were a lot of people taking pictures as the brewing operation is front and center."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works is a really cool bar/restaurant, and I dont think anyone can depute that. If you take friends and family here they will be impressed with the venue.   The food for the price is a little underwhelming other than their Pizza's. They are pretty delicious for the price so I would shoot for that when going here. The beer is pretty good I am a fan of the Pious Monk Dunkle and a few of their other beers.   Last time I was here the order time on the Pizza's were about 45 min - 1 hour so it took a while but I think they were just overly busy that night, so I think I can forgive them for that. The waitress was apologetic and nice so it wasn't a big deal.   Overall I like church brew works. It's a super unique place with good Beer and Pizza. You have to give it a try at least once."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food but the beer was NOT good. It tasted either watered down, or super bitter and not in that good dark beer type of way. I supposed there had to have been a reason why it only cost $13 for 8 4 oz. samples.  Despite the bad beer, I still give it three stars because it was still pretty awesome - the brewery itself, that is. How many church-turned-breweries will you get to visit in your lifetime? Come for the atmosphere but don't get your hopes too high about the brews.  Tip - free parking in their lot around back."}
{"text":"Located in a beautiful old church my eyes always have to adjust going inside to the dark interior.  When they do though, I am not disappointed.  The vast church has been carefully turned into a great restaurant and bar.  The staff is friendly, the food is good and beer is cold.  The reason to check out Church Brew Works, aside from the great pizza, is the beer.  This micro-brew has the tanks on the alter and a wonderful selection of local brews.  Also, it is a steal to take home a growler filled for only $7 for 4 pints.  Definitively a unique place worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have to hand it to the interior architects who designed the conversion of this old Catholic church into a restaurant.  It is a trippy, surealistic place.  The stained glass windows are intact and the hop vats (is that what they're called?) are up where the altar once was.  Yeah, there was a bit of sacrilige going on.  But that's fine with me.  I had a business lunch there and had a half southwestern chicken, hold the chipotle aioli, with a balsamic vinagerette salad.  It was tasty though not spectacular.    Service was adequate but not particulary attentive.  I'm giving this a four star mainly because of the ambiance.  I've been in converted church establishments before (London, New York and Salinas CA) but all of those places removed much of the religious iconry.  Not Church Brew and Works.  For those who have an issue with this, I'm glad the place wasn't razed and replaced with condos.  Check this place out.  It's a trip."}
{"text":"Church Brew Works, as the name suggests, is a church turned brewery. This is apparent when you enter this beautifully adorned church and see the brewing equipment front and center on the altar. Walking past the pews and extravagant stained glass windows with a beer in hand almost feels blasphemous, but after a few sips you are reminded that this is just a really cool concept and a way to preserve a true work of art (both the building and the beer).  They had a great selection of your standard pub food and prices were reasonable. The beer was very tasty and they had a range of flavors at many levels of alcohol (Jack Skeleton was our favorite). The nachos were good and well-portioned and the in-traditional pierogis were also tasty. Service was good as our waiters were friendly, attentive, and provided some great recommendations on beer. Between the ambiance, beer, and food, you cannot go wrong and this is truly a different experience worth trying out."}
{"text":"Food was good. Took a big party here and they accommodated us nicely. It's hard in Pittsburgh to book large parties with some of these restaurants. The staff made everything easy. Of course the party was very impressed with the atmosphere. Even my very picky friend enjoyed it here."}
{"text":"Great prices, if you come early you're seated quickly. Good service. Awesome beer samplers. Perogies are yummy but the best was 7 onion soup, even the bread and butter. Live polka music right now!"}
{"text":"The food here is hit or miss.  I have had delicious dishes (the cheesesteak) and other not so great dishes (buffalo burger was dried out).  The beer is why I keep going back.  Their Gold and dunkel beers are the two I typically get.  If you have never been here the atmosphere and church setting are unique.  I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a fellow out of town conference attendee, and loved the idea of a brewery in a church a la McMenamin's Chapel Pub in Portland, Oregon, so we grabbed a cab and headed out.  The restaurant is indeed housed in a former catholic church and for that gets 2 stars. Seating options were outdoors or indoors; bar or restaurant. We selected the restaurant which we later learned has a separate menu from the bar seating. This is important, since the restaurant menu doesn't offer the pizzas which were pretty much the best thing there. I mean that in a good way, the pizzas are similar to the kind you might find in northern Italy, in fact it might have been the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Also recommended: the spinach, feta and gouda dip. The menu was interesting and we enjoyed the bison and mushroom meatloaf, wings  and several types of perogies, but the dip and pizzas were the high points for us.  The beer was excellent. We ordered a sampler and then each had a pint of our favorite. The Dunkel was a winner as was the seasonal hopless Ambrosia. Really fine beers for all palates. While not cheap, the prices were reasonable for the quality of food and ambiance. Service was excellent, and in later conversation we tabbed our waiter Shawn, \"Porter Laureate\", for his artfully accurate descriptions of the various beers.  I would return here if the opportunity should ever arise."}
{"text":"I came here with my lovely trainer who was super excited to be bringing me to a church turned brewery restaurant. And frankly, so was I! Apparently, they no longer allow churches to be sold with their interior decor so this place is truly one of a kind!  First off, this place is huge so you don't have to shy away from bringing large groups. They have a small lot behind the church so do consider carpooling. You are literally walking into a church and then walk into a large brewery instead. It is really fun! There is an earthy smell to the place that I liked (kinda like beets!) You can also see some of the cook stations like the pizza and oven dishes right up by the altar!  I tried their celestial gold beer and I highly recommend it for those who enjoy lighter beers.  Now to the food. I am not a German food eater and I was new to the cuisine sans dessert so be warned. I have been told German food is an acquired taste and can go wrong if you are not familiar with it. We started off with the perogies and I loved them! So soft and tasty. When we asked for an entree recommendation from our waitress, she said the buffalo pasta was one of her favorites. Loving the safety of chicken and pasta and buffalo sauce, I ordered it. The description said buffalo cream sauce with crumbled (blue/feta?) cheese on top. I am a sucker for creamy sauces. Well, I could not get through 4 bites of anything more than the pasta in this dish and I was trying really hard. The cream sauce appeared to be plain buffalo sauce that was congregating at the bottom of the paste discussing their very liquid form. The waitress was kind enough to exchange it for an appetizer of potato cakes and dessert.   Potato cakes needed some seasoning. Their frozen peanut butter cake was perfect though.  Granted, I stayed away from their traditional plates. However, my trainer had the braised pork chop with sauerkraut and that wasn't appetizing either.   The customer service experience here was great. Our waitress was attentive and we never had to waive her down for requests (this was before and after returning my dish by the way). The hostess was also super friendly and nice. The manager also came over to apologize. I really hate when I catch a managers attention since I am not at the restaurant to make a scene so it was nice for him to come by but definitely not necessary so kudos to their crew for that.  If you come here, expect great beer and a good time."}
{"text":"It's fine, but not my favorite place. I feel like it's always crowded and the food is average."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum.   Great little place for lunch. The atmosphere is beautiful.  Our table ordered a pierogi pizza, Childs meal of grilled chicken, a steak sandwich in a wrap, and basket of sweet potato fries.    It was surprisingly very quiet at lunch time. We were seated immediately. The lunch menu is short and easy to navigate. We decided to split the fries and pierogi pizza. Not a healthy meal but it was delicious. We really could have done without the fries but I'm glad we got them and had to take home leftovers.   The real star of the meal at CBW is their kids meal. A grilled chicken breast w a variety of side choices. We chose the black bean salad for the kids meal side. It was gobbled down quickly. I am very pleased that there are options other than fries and apples on the kids meal. Way to go CBW!   Food was excellent, will return again. And again. And again."}
