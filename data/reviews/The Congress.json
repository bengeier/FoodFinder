{"text":"This is our favourite spot at Yonge/Sheppard to take in a Leafs game. A few big-screen TV's, a (free) pool table and a great selection of imported tall boys. The bar has a very friendly vibe ... a \"Cheers\" kinda feel. The menu is limited; however the wings & fries are excellent (other options include chicken fingers, chicken pot pie and pepperoni pizza). The staff are very friendly too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best quality of service and price, this is the bar to go. The best chicken wings in Canada. Friendly atmosphere where the owner really care about its costumers."}
{"text":"My favourite bar in North York. For whatever reason Yelp thought it necessary to withhold my previous review. Goofs. Anyway, the bar is located in between Sheppard and the 401 and actually doesn't have a sign, just red paint over brick. The lighting inside is black light which is pretty cool. Thursdays are the best for music as they got a DJ come in that plays the greatest in old school hip-hop.  You actually have to be 21 to get in as the owners don't want drunk kids coming in. It's basic bar grub like wings and rings which are absolutely outstanding as I know the owner uses fresh oil for it. Makes a world of difference compared to other joints in the neighbourhood like St Louis or whatever.  Pints are pretty five bones a pop like Sapporo and Moosehead. I go here primarily for the regulars to watch and banter about hockey and UFC. There is also a free pool table and the leather couches are pretty comfy too. I make a 3 km to get here as I won't justify $7-8 for a pint of beer when I get can get the same thing plus better food at Congress for less."}
{"text":"Hell no... lol I am absolutely convinced that every positive review here is a relative, or recent prison cell-mate of the owner, lol.    I live quite nearby and based on the positive reviews, I decided to pop in and catch a Jays game.  My visit lasted 30 seconds, which was long enough to nod to a couple of otherwise homeless / recently-paroled guys at the bar, survey the 1986 rear-projection TV that sat in front of two shredded sofas that were too ripped-up to stay in the '73 Rambler they came out of, then mumble a quiet apology to the seemingly-friendly owner, who was yelling at his kids as they played on the sticky carpet, and seemed just as surprised to have a client walk in as the rest of the \"clientele\".  Don't.  Trust me, just don't."}
{"text":"Sorry to the owner, but this bar is in need of a serious Reno. Awful atmosphere, I love dive bars, but this place is just grimy. Bartender is a nice guy, but you can tell he just doesn't care about the place. Price is Right and wings are just ok. Free pool is no substitute for  a general sense of cleanliness, a little face lift would go along way."}
{"text":"Congress is a very local bar with a friendly atmosphere. The sofas look like they were stolen from the common room of a college dorm and free pool on a table salvaged from the junkyard. There is usually only a single beer on tap, so its quite sufficient to order by just saying 'a pitcher'.  The place has a couple TVs to catch the latest sporting events and the bar often runs an NFL pool in the fall. Overall, its a nice place to hangout which is out of the way of some busier places in North York."}
{"text":"Legit dive bar. Low prices and no ironic artifacts. The owner is friendly and the regulars are ready to engage in bar talk."}
