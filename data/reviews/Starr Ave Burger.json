{"text":"Very disappointing. Went today for lunch about an hour after they opened. Condiment selection did not look fresh, lettuce was mostly brown, pickles and tomatoes also looked quite sad. While waiting for our burgers, saw lady behind the counter 'tossing' the lettuce with tongs in an attempt to make it look fresher. Burgers had a burnt taste to them and were actually charred in places, bacon was cold. Fries were hardly warm and tasted old. They did make a fresh order of fries when we brought them back however the original order of fries we received should never have been served to us in the first place. This used to be our fav burger place, last 2 visits prior to today also disappointing and after today we will not be returning. 

We do not recommend this place something has changed.  We are rating one star and giving it 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place recently and found the food (Starr Cheeseburger and Fries) to be adequate.  The staff are not really super friendly, so it's iffy as to whether I'll go back or not, since burger joints are a dime a dozen."}
{"text":"The best place for a burger in Whitby. Great burgers, fantastic fries... one of my favorite spots.  The only reason why I can't give them 5 stars is that I don't particularly like their gravy.   Aside from the gravy, everything I've tried on the menu is great."}
{"text":"Regretfully declined over the past few years. Still a neighbourhood gem but the age old debate of Starr Burger vs. johnny burger (2 mins south) is tipping towards the latter. Consistency is an issue; daytime cooking crew produces much better product than weekend/evening kids."}
{"text":"I was with my family tonight 6/14/2015 and was disgusted with how the owner handled a situation with the young man on cash. First of all the young man who took our order was so sweet and very professional. Then the owner came out and began \"correcting\" him in front of the customers and other staff. Very poor and unprofessional. The poor kid was embarrassed. Our family frequents this establishment regularly and we will never eat there again. We will not give money to a business who treats the staff with no respect. Truly disgusted by the owners attitude and lack of professionalism."}
{"text":"Always loved this place and its never let me down.

Delicious onion rings, large portions of a burger, have veggie burger options, many toppings, they have ice creams (that are great), a wonderful environment (space), and nice service. One of the best burger places to go in Whitby, and even Durham region.

Worth a try, and you'll probably be back."}
{"text":"The place is empty. 

The kids who work there are atrociously rude. This young girl who works there with strait brown hair, short and very skinny (has a baby face) was incredibly unkind to us. My friend was placing his order and she was  hostile towards. He is a really sweet guy! She asked me a question and I said pardon and she shrieked ketchup  mustard or mayo!  When we were waiting for our meal they kept laughing and looking at us. Was so unbelievably rude. I have no idea why they treated us so inhumanely. I asked her something about the sauce and she looked at me like I was stupid and yelled tzatziki and started talking about me to this blond chick. I've never experienced this level of audacious and cruel service in my life. 

Our buns were cold and our burgers were covered with black filth. They seemed to snicker at us behind our back because they were serving us burnt burgers. 

Their fries look disgusting and are loaded with salt. Since the buns were not toasted they become soggy in a matter of a few minutes and I couldn't even finish this soggy mess of a burger and their deformed appearing fries that looked like they were diseased grossed me out. 

Go to Big Boy Burgers - Their customer service is excellent and I don't mind the fact that they only take cash anymore because this level of horrendous behavior which really makes you feel humiliated and worthless is completely not worth being exposed to and to top it off the food is total crap. They do not care about providing you with delicious food or even friendly service - they joke around and laugh at you. I left despirited and I know I will never ever return there and will without hesitation inform people who I know (and I know a lot of people in whitby) also about my experience. I am also going to post on urban spoon just in case somebody misses this post. I believe in being kind to people and this behavior when combined with the abominable food just makes me sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"I get the appeal for this burger joint, it looks authentic, been around forever and caters to the right market without confusion.  I've eaten here a few times as I feel most places must be given chances over several occasions, over a long period of time before making judgement.

It's ok, not the best, certainly not the worst.  However, burgers although a good portion, are not great, the fries are ok, the onion rings have too much batter and are extremely greasy (worse if you get take out as batter and oil make the rings soggy).

As for value...decent, certainly reasonable.

So, it's not bad, might be for you, for me I've had better, comes down to taste and expectations."}
{"text":"Great Burgers,fries and especially the Onion Rings!
Never had a bad meal. Everyone loves this place.
Handmade everything, what's not to like?
Not a fifth star due to service issues on occasion. Nothing too bad just can't justify 5 stars.
Recommend having the Steak on a kaiser!"}
{"text":"Lots of  grease from the burger n onion ring. the batter of the onion ring is way too thick, oil is old n that's all i can taste."}
{"text":"If you want a REAL burger, this is the place to get it!  Lots of choices, grilled fresh!  This is a great place for a burger and fries!  Probably the best in Whitby."}
{"text":"We've been to Starr Burger before, but yesterday I was reminded of why we only go there about once a year.  My wife & I took our two young boys there for lunch, & waited an appropriate amount of time for our food (about 10 minutes, as there were several people ahead of us).  The food was definitely disappointing, especially considering that they seem to be perennial winners in the \"Best Burger\" polls in the local newspaper.

My Starr Burger (no bacon or cheese) was very dry & almost tasteless, which is strange, seeing as how they're supposed to be made of fresh ground beef.  When you ask anybody to describe a good burger, nine times out of ten, the first word used, is \"juicy\".  My burger was so dry that I had to use my root beer to wash it down (normally, I don't touch my drink until I'm done eating).  The burger toppings were pleasantly fresh & tasty, but let's face it, nobody goes back to a place because their toppings are fresh.  The burger is supposed to be the star of the show, & this one was a huge letdown.  Dry, bland & understated.  Not a good statement piece.

Their fries may be fresh-cut, but all I could taste was the starchy, potato-whitener they use.  The fries were also very bland & tasteless, again, very disappointing for \"fresh-cut\".  I would rather have frozen fries that taste good than fresh-cut fries with no taste.  A good french fry shouldn't need ketchup, vinegar or any other condiments if they're hot & they're made properly.  McDonald's has the best fries of any fast-food chain, & they're frozen.  If you can't figure out how to make freshly-cut fries without using a ton of potato-whitener, then maybe you're in the wrong business, or maybe you should just use frozen fries.

My wife's grilled chicken sandwich was so salty that she could barely eat it.  I'm not sure what seasoning they use on their chicken, but they were obviously a little too heavy-handed while applying it.

There were a couple of highchairs available for use, & when I grabbed one for my 19-month-old, I noticed the plastic buckle on the safety strap was broken.  I went to grab the other highchair, but it had NO plastic buckle on it.  It's not the worst thing you could find in a family restaurant, but it definitely doesn't help their case, either.  The decor & the 50's diner motif is neat, but if you're going in the fall or winter, be sure to wear a sweater.  I don't know why, but it always seems drafty in there, even when you're not sitting by the door.

It seems like I'm always disappointed when I leave Starr Burger, & the next time I'm craving a burger, I'm going to Johnny Burger.  They might use frozen burgers & fries, but at least they actually taste good, & it's a better value."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of speculation over whether or not the burgers are home made or not, and honestly Im not too sure myself. However, what I can say is that taste-wise, the burgers are very delicious! If you are looking for quality service, Starr Burger is for sure a great place to be. Great for kids and kids-at-heart as well!

The buns can be a little small, and though they may have their flaws, if you're looking for a full-bodied, beefy experience that is worth your coin, Starr Ave Burger just might be the place for you! ;-)"}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Evah! Get the Starr burger - especially with cheese and bacon. Huge, good char, and tasty! Fries are awesome too!"}
{"text":"My two star rating is because the staff are very friendly.   However the food, as most people mentioned,  was a pile of grease.   I got the Starr burger meaning it was homemade and thus a few dollars more.  I cannot understand why this is an option (homemade or not).  They should choose one or the other.  The burger wasn't bad but wasn't particularly great.  Basic patty, nothing special.  The onion rings were a thick batter and drenched in oil that tasted as if it's been around since the place first opened.  I definitely will not return.  I was hoping maybe my experience was different but in reading yelp and google reviews it appears that this place enjoys serving over-battered piles of grease."}
{"text":"Best burger place in Whitby!

They just renovated it, it looks pretty nice.

Definitely go there, buy a burger, get some delicious fries, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love it here. The burgers are very tasty, they  also sell Kawartha Dairy ice cream. I like sitting on the patio in the summer and eating poutine. They renovated around a year ago and it looks great. Starr Burger has great employees and makes good food."}
{"text":"Was absolutely starving we passed this place and decided to give it a try. Prices are decent, fries are fresh cut and amazing, burger was fresh and flavorful.  I would get take our next time because the place was freezing imnot sure they had heat on, not the most enjoyable eating lunch with a jacket scarf and hat on"}
