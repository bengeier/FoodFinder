{"text":"To make a long story short, if you demanded my recommendations for a week's worth of lunches in Mesa, Bistro a la Mode would be five of them. If I start listing *all* the things I liked about this hidden gem, well...you'd get too hungry and go someplace FAR less worthwhile. 

The B. ala M. applies all the thoughtfulness and craft one could ask in a four-star nuptial plating to their public pop-up lunch service next to the Stonebridge Manor (which, in addition to hosting weddings, provides a sprawling backyard to the Bistro to walk off that marsala pot pie). Dishes are elegant, playful (see: \"adult\" grilled cheese), genuinely delicious, and in keeping with the a-la-mode theme, accompanied by some decadent chaser of asiago mashed potatoes, creamy beef salad, or the classic ice cream in the case of their stellar desserts.

The check (a scandalous bargain) is delivered, adorably, in the flyleaf of a vintage book. If nothing else, this flourish demonstrates that my native Seattle has lost its primacy in the art of the world-class dining experience. The *best* lunches are served in Mesa, five minutes off 202."}
{"text":"I ate here with a small group of ladies on November 10, the second day the new patio of Bistro and Batten first opened. While we have truly loved the atmosphere at their prior location adjacent to this one (Bistro ala Mode) this venue is also lovely. (The indoor restaurant was preparing for their grand opening which I imagine went smoothly.) It's so nice to go to a restaurant that's not located in a strip mall or shopping center. It was very quiet and relaxed. Beautifully furnished and planned. The food is the same as before--excellent. Everything we ordered was delicious. And we once again were welcomed and served by the endearing and excellent Tricia. She's top-notch!!"}
{"text":"4 people in party...everyone's food was excellent (5 stars). Price (5 stars) - Large salad + sm side $8, pot pie (served in sm ramekin) excellent chicken stew with pastry on top & mashed potatoes on top of that + sm side $8, sweet potato tots side was best I've ever had.  2 checks were $14 ea, so glasses of wine must've been about $6...stemless wine glass pour didn't seem very generous. 
1 menu item a tad confusing...adult cheese sandwich \"changes.\" This day the \"cheese sandwich\" was a meatball sub w/marinara. Also mac & cheese side was mac & pesto.
Deducted 1 star for server's attitude. 2 people thought he was funny, 2 did not.
Atmosphere on patio was very nice.
Signage to find this place is better than it had been, so if you couldn't find it b4, give it another try. Driveway/gate is furthest one west. 
Brunch Saturday only. After tasting lunch items for 1st time, I'd definitely like to try brunch. 
Bldg site to East WB new indoor/outdoor restaurant opening Mar or Apr 2017.
Flip over the paper menu & you'll be able to read about the house."}
{"text":"Thank You Bistro a la Mode for a wonderful spring Anniversary Lunch with my honey. Beautiful setting, Great food and Wonderful Company..:). The kind of place where housewives and professional women would gather for a nice casual lunch to catch-up. Service was top notch but not bother-sum. Portions are just right. Very Reasonably Priced. We had the sandwich tray
and the desert platter. It's our Anniversary ( Why Not ). Couldn't find a thing wrong with anything."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and well ran. Nice to have an awesome up in north Mesa. Just the Design and decor is worth  stopping by for. Excited to frequent this restaurant for years to come! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food, inexpensive, laid bank atmosphere...I'm not usually one for anyplace called \"bistro\" LOL but I'm glad I took the chance!

I had the grown up grilled cheese and twisted Mac n cheese, my wife had a southwest salad. We had apple/berry pie and rice pudding. Delicious! And under $20"}
{"text":"Only the 3rd night they were open for business, and they had it all together.  Delicious food, beautiful venue and great service.  So excited to have this venue nearby."}
{"text":"Ok, I was expecting a pretty great treat when we decided to head to Bistro A La Mode for the first time, but even with my high expectations, everything about this place was FANTASTIC!  I ordered the \"Grown Up Grilled Cheese\" which apparently changes day to day.  Well, my order must have been one of those magical moments when Chef Tess created something extraordinary. My mouth waters when I think about it and I'm always looking forward to my next visit. Amazing unique food and a very relaxing location. Thanks for sharing your talents with the world Bistro A La Mode."}
{"text":"2nd yelp review I've ever written because it's hard finding a place that's worth my time writing something about. This place is delicious. The property looks amazing, the food looks amazing, and it tastes just as amazing. Love this hidden gem, I make to stop here whenever in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem.
The menu here is simple yet complex.
By that I mean they have sandwiches, soups and salads but they are ever changing such as the the -Mac n Cheese, Grown-up Grilled Cheese, soup and some of the dessert. Don't worry though, they do have some items that are always the same.
We couldn't decide what sandwich to have so we decided to share the Tour de France which gets you 1/2 of the Southwestern Chicken Salad Croissant (our fav), Chicken Caprese and the Grown-up Grilled Cheese and comes with 2 sides of your choice so we opted for the house made chips and the mac n cheese.
The portion was perfect for us to share.
We couldn't decide on the dessert so we ordered the pastry platter which gets you the butter bar, pie of the day and the pastry of the day.  ***caution not for the faint of heart or those watching their weight 
We can't wait to go back again and try other items on the menu.
The setting was gorgeous and perfect.  A must try  for sure."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed having dinner on the patio.  The short ribs were excellent.  The duck was very nice as well.  Most of us had the short ribs so I can't comment on the other meals. We will certainly be back.  I loved the fire pit concept, it was a beautiful evening and we watched the moon rise.  The staff was very accommodating for our large crowd and even brought heaters over to our table."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Chives Cafe, this is a hidden gem for weekday lunch. Prices are very reasonable and the food is gourmet. Located in the Stonebridge Manor event venue. Seating is currently inside due to heat but there's a beautiful patio with greenery where lunch is served in cooler weather."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem via Yelp.  What a find!  Highly recommend the Tour du France with sweet potato tots.  So delicious we forgot to take a picture before it was all gone."}
{"text":"New place in Mesa went there tonight with friends for dinner. Setting outside is  around fireplaces in side is bright and open. The  servers are friendly and knowledgeable. They have a very reasonable wine list and all the food that we ordered was excellent. It was cooked to perfection with nice presentation. Definite repeat!"}
{"text":"Very cute, quaint little place nestled in a commercial industry park. I'm sure the wedding venue was there first and is just thrilled to be surrounded by all the industrial buildings.  But, they have done an exceptional job of blending in and remaining cozy.  It sure makes me wish I hand planted ficus trees in my yard .  The grounds are gorgeous and there is a sweet little wedding venue next door.  The atmosphere is chic and the simple menu is nice.  The strawberry salad was very good and the grilled cheese of the day was really good.  I loved the passion flavored iced tea.  The patio is lovely and I bet it would be fabulous at night to sit outside with the huge fire tables .   We will go back definitely."}
{"text":"Went to B&B on a Friday during social hour with my girlfriend. Loved the sliders, sausages, and garlic bread. Very nice decor and everything was very clean. Staff was friendly. Didn't order any drinks but I noticed they had Kiltlifter on draft, which was a plus. Will be coming here again and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly environment from the wait staff to the manager. Amazing food. Absolutely beautiful restaurant inside and out. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great restaurants experience."}
{"text":"We ordered the charcuterie platter and it was beautifully presented.  Things went downhill from there.  I had the fish (only fish on menu) and it was dry and tasteless.  My husband had the duck and said it was okay but that he has made it better at home.  My daughter had the fried chicken which was decent but she said the portion was small.  I later saw a wait staff eating the fried chicken; I realized then it is the best dish on the dinner menu.    The tab was $120.  My husband said the wine was excellent.   The service was top notch but the food left much room for improvement.   I will be back though for the beautiful surroundings and service.  I read reviews and figure maybe lunch is better?  I hope dinner improves since Mesa is desperate for a go to excellent restaurant!  I think they could do well with a tapas menu.

OH we had the Italian Cake for dessert.  It was okay.  It was thick with frosting and I wouldn't order it again.  It was a step above grocery store cake - just very heavy and way to sweet.   I usually go for chocolate dessert but the only chocolate dessert they had entailed mint in it which I don't like so much."}
{"text":"Where to start!!  The food is amazing! The fireplaces makes me want to keep coming back ... it's so relaxing to sit there and meet new people and enjoy a glass of wine. The service has been top notch!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. We sat on the patio on a beautiful March day. The service was excellent, friendly and attentive. The soup of the day ( chicken vegetable) was slightly disappointing. The salad and dressing were very good."}
{"text":"FINALLY a nice place with 5 star food close by! Everything tasted how it does at the nice restaurants 20-30 west of here. This was my favorite brunch place (before when it was bistro a la mode) but now it's my favorite dinner place, too. I love the new building and the outdoor patio. Definitely go here if you love amazing food and live in Mesa."}
{"text":"Quite literally the best meal I have ever had. Unique takes and flavors made it interesting, beautiful, and delicious. I had no idea this bistro was even here, it is now officially my favorite."}
{"text":"What a great little place in the most unexpected area. They are brand new and still working out some kinks. But overall my experiences have been great! They run out of food and cocktails and then don't update their menus but I am sure they will learn and resolve this in no time. The food I have ordered has been absolutely delicious! Perfect portions and unique. I can see the unlimited potential of this place so I really wish them well! You MUST go check them out!"}
{"text":"I love little places like this. Menu is always changing, EVERYTHING IS GOOD. Beautiful location. Came here with gams on lunch date. I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"This was a nice find on our way to the Airport. The food was great and of course the beer was too! When we first walked in we were stared down, but maybe because we had a 2 year old with us. Ha ha. Loved it though."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast (Saturday's only) and lunch. It's great food for anywhere especially for North Mesa where non-chain restaurants and innovative food is difficult to find. I had the summer salad, sweet potato tots and tried the potato salad. All were excellent. For breakfast I had the bruleed oatmeal and honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life. It's quaint and quiet. The grounds are clean and beautiful and the prices are great too. I'm counting down the days until I get my hands on that oatmeal again. Truly a gem of a place."}
{"text":"I'm totally a regular here.  Everything I said in my previous review is true except I think the current chef (the same chef from my earlier review) is even better than all the ones before.  I am in love with so many things here, from the beautiful presentation of the dishes, to the perfect portion sizes, to the flavors and deliciousness of the food, to the friendly service.  The food has been consistently good in the past year I've been coming here since Bistro a la Mode opened with this chef."}
{"text":"We ordered the fish, fried chicken, duck, and charcuterie board. The charcuterie board was good, but the rest of the food lacked flavor. Many of the entrees could have been easily improved with more spices or some kind of sauce. The basa was particularly bland.

Also, the portions you are getting for the price is ridiculous. The fried chicken was $19 and the amount you received was disappointing; about 80% of the plate was biscuit and spinach. 

The atmosphere was beautiful and the staff was friendly, so we would be willing to try it again for lunch."}
{"text":"Beautiful location at stone bridge manor, delicious food including the chicken Marsala pot pie and one of a kind Carmel bars with lemon creme, a hidden gem"}
{"text":"The brand new Board and Batten was superb. I went with 9 others. I think we got every entree but the fried chicken. I'm sure it's fabulous too,  there was not one drop left on anyone's plate. We all (couples) ordered the bread In Terra cotta pot!!! Presentation A+. It tasted as good as it looked. Herb butter to slather on. Yum. Next my hubby and I split the  caprese salad. Just perfect as a starter.   I got the duck. Never had duck before but a friend had been at tasting opening and told me she would buy my dinner if I didn't like it. It was just like butter no fat, or  gamey tasting. If I hadn't know what I ordered I would of thought it was a pork tenderloin.. the beef short ribs were a hit as well as the white fish and risotto.
We are planning on using there gorgeous patio and fire pit area. 
Oana was our server and her joy for her job showed every minute of our time there."}
{"text":"This place is good. I give them a 5 star because I am pretty picky about my food and it's not their fault if I wasn't thrilled with it. I had the grilled cheese ( Swiss,onions and fig jam ) and bruschetta Mac n cheese. It was OK.  I'm not too adventurous but I can understand why foodies would love it. Give it a try but check FB menu first."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience combining a delicious variety of lunch and lite-lunch items.  The outdoor experience is very enjoyable and very nicely done.  What's nice is that the menu items change regularly enough to keep a great variety of choices available.  Serving sizes are very generous and extremely well presented.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  Bistro a La Mode is a great lunch option that will never get stale or predictable because they're always changing things around slightly.  Very reasonably priced lunch destination especially for week-day lunches out in East Mesa.  I'm looking forward to going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Lovely little out of the way bistro you'll never find unless you're looking for it.  The menu is interesting, the sandwiches were good, the service was excellent.  Nice way to spend a lovely, sunny day.  While you're there, take a look at the facility where they do the weddings....really a lovely spot.  
Only has outdoor seating so bring a jacket if it's cool out....."}
{"text":"What a pure joy!  Very scenic and beautiful!  Had no idea this place was even tucked back there!  Our waiter was amazing as well!  Can't wait for their dinner house!  Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Good service. Attractive but load room. Salmon was small portion.  Sorry just average"}
{"text":"I placed a takeout order today for lunch, because it's right down the street from my office.  It will definitely be a new go to spot for lunch now.  They had it ready quickly, and everything was amazing.  I ordered the grown-up grilled cheese with a side of the twisted mac n' cheese that has spinach and mushrooms in it.  It was delicious, and I thought the portion sizes were spot on."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem in Mesa!  The good is outstanding, the wine selection stellar, and the staff top-notch. You have to try this place!  A must!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant with top quality food and service. I had my baby shower there & everything was beyond my expectations. Highly recommend Board &Batten."}
{"text":"Found a hidden gem in Mesa! 

Stopped for a late afternoon bite, arrived for the Social Hour between 3-6pm.

Food was excellent, good portion size for sharing if you order multiple items for a group.

Service was efficient and friendly and the location was fab, inviting patio and nice decor.

Pricing was good value for money."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing and super attentive! Even tho it was 5 minutes before closed they welcomed people to sit down. Anything and everything we tried was beyond 5 stars! Definitely coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting on the patio. Service is a little slow. We like to be seated and then have something in front of us, be it water and menus or drinks. We ordered the soup of the day, tour de france with sides of sweet potatoe tots and house made chips. Waited quite a while then everything came at once. Beautifully presented.Would have liked the soup first.  Bean soup was a little thin, sandwiches were great and sides were ho hum. Dessert platter was overly sweet - sickly sweet. Iced teas were also very sweet. Portion sizes are a little on the small size but prices were very reasonable. Wait staff was friendly. I'm not sure we would go back but will recommend it"}
{"text":"Quaint, local spot with so many yummy options! For what the offer, the prices are great. I've loved everything I've had: beef pot pie, filet sliders, homemade chicken nuggets for kids are awesome, the dessert. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Normally I would give this place a higher rating because I have been here before and it was great. However, I am here right now and the food and service is terrible. I understand that it is Valentines Day and there are more people here then normal, but the food and service should not suffer. Our order was taken quickly and our drinks were also brought out fast. However, both of us received the wrong dishes and it took forever for someone to come over so we could tell them. Once we told them our food was incorrect they apologized and brought the correct orders. Once I received my food, which was the grown up grilled cheese (ham & cheddar on a croissant) it was not appetizing nor did it taste good (see the pic). I took 2 bits and could not eat anymore. I will come back here for lunch because like I said earlier it's usually great, but I definitely will not come on a day where it's busy.


Edit: they did apologize quite a bit and only charged for one meal, which was good I do appreciate that they took responsibility for the mess ups."}
{"text":"Another excellent experience in East Mesa. Highly recommend this hidden gem. This quaint, European hideaway surprises the palette with delicious sandwiches, salads and desserts. Wine selection is great and as we sit and eat, were already planning our return."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, but the overall atmosphere of this place is even better! FYI, there is not too many options on the menu, but you will enjoy the current ones."}
{"text":"My daughter told me about this place, so I thought I would try it out. My friend and I went today and had a chichen pot pie, and peach pie for dessert.  They were both perfect.  You can tell someone knows what they're doing in the kitchen.  The service was great to.  I will be back to try the menu out."}
{"text":"I had a lunch there today. It was such a pleasant surprise. The location,  ambient, food and service was all very superb! Only open for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place! The Stonebridge Manor is fancy and sitting inside we had a lovely view of the garden. It reminded my husband of a bistro like back home (England) with a relaxed vibe and a feeling like you could sit there and enjoy yourself for hours. We had the 'grown up grilled cheese' that was steak and Swiss on a fresh baguette with an aus ju sauce... it was delicious and the sweet potato tots were so yummy. And we had a beef and burgundy pot pie- it was so rich, with tasty mashed potatoes on top. We took home the Carmel butter bar and shared with my mom... it had lemon frosting piped on it and Carmel sauce on the side. It was dessert heaven. This place is definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"This place is adorable!! Definitely not what I expected to find in this part of Mesa. So happy to have found it. I thought for sure I'd be stuck looking for an Applebees for a quick drink. Not only was the mimosa amazing, but the food menu look fantastic as well! Cant wait to go back and try the food!"}
{"text":"This little gem is packed away nicely in an old orange grove. This probably has one of the nicest patios on the east side, and both their menu and food is very well made. My only knock was the lack of beer options...kilt lifter was the only non-light beer."}
{"text":"Lauren set up my party of 25 ladies for lunch and did a fantastic job! Our food was delicious the staff was very attentive.  All had a very nice time and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a very nice atmosphere and great on a pretty day to sit outside. Do not expect fast service because they only have 1 server but he does try his best and will gradually get everyone helped. The food is pretty basic and could have more choices especially since I do not eat chicken but the desserts are wonderful!"}
{"text":"What a nice relaxing little place to have a tasty bite to eat. This is not your little mom and pop shop. You can tell it's made with more professional experience. The server was helpful, pleasant, and kind. Thanks for the lunch."}
{"text":"Lee provided excellent service.   

I ordered the beef burgundy pot pie.

The outdoor seating is beautiful.

The prices are good.

Hopefully this is my third review not my second.

Quote from website:
Board & Batten prides itself on using the best ingredients possible when preparing our cuisine. That being said, we have paired with TrueGarden in Mesa, AZ, which provides high quality aeroponic herbs grown less than a half mile away from our restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the outside seating and the grounds are gorgeous. Went to the restroom and was trying to think of a reason to have an event here cause the grounds are immaculate. Had the Chicken Marsala potpie which was very good & the sweet potato tots. Waiter, Zach, was very accommodating & efficient. He gave us time to talk & didn't rush us at all. We confused him with 6 different bills but he did great!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. We found this hidden gem this last weekend and we were thoroughly impressed. Service was great, food was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect. Keep doing what you're doing because it works!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Sliders were the best, especially with the tomato jelly. Beautifully decorated. The string lights and fire pits give an intimate feel. Service was excellent. Each item on menu is a little different from your standard with a twist. Can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu! Hidden gem in East Mesa!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this morning and so glad I did. This place is BOMB. I got the French dip with Mac n cheese and he went for the grown up grilled cheese with tomato soup. We split right down the middle and complimented our lunch with some blackberry mimosas. We need more places like this in Mesa! I loved eating out on the patio. So pretty!"}
{"text":"The food is SOOOOO good here I can't belive it, but it's true. I love their food and especially the pickles."}
{"text":"I took my mother for lunch. Charming little place with delicious food (we had a spinach salad with chicken) and amazing Italian wedding cake!! Just be aware the restaurant is VERY noisy. It is used for weddings, so the floors and walls are bare. The slightest noise (conversations and laughter) from across the restaurant can be heard. We will be back on a nice fall day."}
{"text":"Good, original food and a very relaxing atmosphere.  The chop salad is big enough for two and very tasty.  The summer squash appetizer with jalapeño spice was unique and delicious.  Great place for a nice date night.  I need to go during lunch hours, as their lunch menu looks even better and more extensive."}
{"text":"What a great surprise in NE mesa! The place is incredible, and the food is awesome. Really thoughtfully done...the space is very nice, including the outside area. I had a sicilian white wine that was fantastic! I would absolutely go here again."}
{"text":"I met my girlfriend here and we both LOVED this place.  The service was great; our waitress was attentive and pleasant (unfortunately I don't remember her name). The food was really good.  I had the sliders,  which came out a little less done than I would like.  The waitress took them back and the chef cooked them through in a timely manner.  The restaurant is also really beautiful,  with a great patio that has fireplaces.I will definitely be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"When you see a restaurant that has mostly 5 star  reviews, pay attention! Reviews can be misleading, or chalked up to personal preference, but this bistro is incredible! For starters, it's in a very tranquil setting: a large, beautiful house set back amongst scenic landscaping. (You can see why it's a great wedding venue.) When the weather cools down it would be great to sit outside.

But the food! My husband and I split the Tour de France, which is one half of each of their four featured sandwiches. This allowed for maximum menu sampling.  Be forewarned that the menu changes often, so I'm not sure if you found a favorite item how sure you could be of when/if it would return. They feature a different grilled cheese sandwich every day. Mine was like a BLT on focaccia with Swiss cheese. It was by far my favorite. The Chicken Caprese sandwich was pretty good. My husband really loved the Southwestern Chicken Salad sandwich, but thought the ground filet slider was just fair. With this sampler, you got to choose two sides. The mac-n-cheese with roasted garlic was tasty. The seasonal fruit cup was outstanding! This may sound foolish, but the way they cut the fruit made all the difference. They sliced green apple into sticks, and the strawberry, pineapple and cantaloupe were thinly sliced and fanned out. 

The produce was top quality, and all of the food was so well-prepared. You can't help but feel like this bistro cares about all the little touches. They even bring your bill enclosed in an antique hardcover book. Loved this place, and will definitely return!

***My review above was for when this place was called Bistro a la Mode. They have now built a new restaurant on the adjacent land, and renamed it Board and Batten. The food is still good, and they've added a couple of extra items to the menu. (Like French Dip) One thing that changed is that they're open for dinner too. 

I think the best part of the new restaurant is what a beautiful job they've done with the decor and ambience. The inside area looks nice, but they have a large patio that's very inviting. It's just a nice off-the-beaten path place to grab a meal."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant. The atmosphere   was great it was so beautiful. I started with tomato soup and bread terra-cotta. The tomato soup was some of the best I have ever had. Mushroom risotto and the white fish both tasty."}
{"text":"Let's support this great Mesa Modern Bistro & Bar in Mesa. Stacey was amazing!  Great ambiance too!"}
{"text":"Loved this hidden gem for lunch! Beautiful patio and excellent food. Service was a bit slow but I loved the spot so much, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A true slice of heaven! Food and service we outstanding! If you are in Mesa and need a lunch spot that is off the beaten path. Go here. The grounds were beautiful! I wish I could have transported my best girlfriends to join me."}
{"text":"The 3 star is based on the service only.  The establishment is so charming and beautiful and the food is delicious.  I have been here twice and both times the B & B has not been extremely busy (came early to avoid the crowds) but the service was extremely slow.  

1st time came to celebrate a girlfriends (party of 4) birthday.  Took awhile to get our drink orders in but once we did and order an appetizer the drinks and food came out quickly.  Took awhile to get our waiter back to order our food.  Finally ordered and when the food came one order was wrong.  It was suppose to be for another table.  Okay...no big deal he was able to correct it pretty quick.  All the food we order was very delicious we were all happy with what we chose.  Next they gave the birthday girl a nice dessert with a Happy Birthday message on the plate.  Nice touch!

2nd time came with girlfriends to meet up prior to our high school reunion so drinks, appetizer and share some light bites.  Came in at 5:30pm it was warmer outside so it was not busy. It took forever to get our drink orders in...finally get our drinks and we order the cheese board that came out pretty quickly but now our waiter in no where to be seen.  He finally came and we order some sliders (menu says 3) we asked can we order (1) extra? No problem...out came 3.  Ordered a salad to share as the portions here are pretty decent.  All the food was delicious now we need the check....ummmmmm where is our waiter?  Finally, we had to ask another employee we need the check get the check pay and can't find him again to pay the bill.  We go an ask another employee here is our check we need to leave to make our reunion...Oh, we cannot process this for you your waiter needs to process.  OMG!  I literally took 30 minutes to get our check, pay the check and get out the door.

So....if you have all the time in the world this place is beautiful, it's brand new the food is delicious just the service both times have been extremely slow."}
{"text":"Wow...where do I start? From the serene grounds to the fantastically delicious food to the beautiful presentation; it's all just so perfect!  My mom is visiting from out of town and we were looking for some place different that wouldn't break the bank; we found more than we could have dreamed of! We came for lunch, we had mimosas, a sandwich sampler platter and a caramel shortbread dessert...each one had such delicious flavors! Mom actually wanted to go back again the next day! Sadly we didn't have time but we will definitely be back.... and lucky for me, I work right down the street! Sorry mom :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Mesa. Delicious food, great atmosphere, and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great food and great price a definite five star lunch venue.

Amazing atmosphere but what else would you expect it is also a wedding venue. Wish I had known about this place sooner would have had my wedding here. That coupled with delicious sandwiches definitely makes this place worth a visit staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Here for  dinner  12/23.  An amazing bistro.  Just a little  noisy and it wasn't even
 full!  Small dinner menu but our 3 entrees were terrific, especially the fried chicken.  I added mashed potatoes to it so it was perfect.  The meat/cheese starter was wonderful and the brie with the bacon topping was something I'd have everytime.

What a delightful little hidden bistro.  Its nice to see fresh menu items that change everyday.  The only draw back may be its all outside seating.  Nice to have a heater today since it was cloudy.  

The servers have been very knowledgable and they appear to care about the customers.  Our coffee was refilled w/o asking and there was always someone around if we needed anything.

The pesto pasta today was over-the-top delicious and the sweet potato tots melt in your mouth.  Their take on the grilled cheese will leave you speechless!  

We tried the pastry tray with 3 desserts on it, a caramel bar, a brown explosion and a pumpkin chocolate chip roll.  Only the last one we didn't like....all 3 together was way way to sweet!  None of us could finish it.  It needed a fruit or citrus to balance out the sweet.

Can't wait to go back.  

While there make a trip to the restroom ( they are inside the mansion).  Beautiful!
Today they were setting up for a Party and we even talked to the owner."}
{"text":"We loved  our evening here. Our food was outstandinfg.  Love our waitress.....Oana from Romania. She's beautiful and a great waitress plus the food is superb. Good company.  A wedding in the background. We had great wine,  great appetizer, pork chops, short ribs, and Basa plus dessert.  Love it all."}
{"text":"Great setting, bring someone special.

Food was very good as well as the service.

This is a little gem that is hidden in Mesa."}
{"text":"Bistro a La Mode is basically the lower level of Stonebridge Manor. They built the restaurant into the house which is why I was so incredibly confused about this place for years! But rest assured, there are plenty of signs signaling you where to go.

The first time I went, my sister and I ordered the \"Grown up Grilled Cheese\" and the Beef Bourguignon. The food totaled around $12 which was not bad at all.

The food arrived very quickly and the plating was gorgeous. The food was even better. I had some of my sisters grilled cheese which had some sort of pot roast in it and swiss on sweet potato bread. I tried hers and it was amazing! I know it was \"Just a grilled cheese\" but it was still great. The flavors in every dish here are very nuanced. The beef had a rich borderlaise-ish sauce. And the sweet potato bread added a nice sweetness. 

My pot pie was also plated beautifully and I was shocked with how great the pie was. Bistro a La Mode has a lot of French influenced dishes and I could really taste the demi-glace in the sauce-- something not a lot of restaurants do because of the price. The Pate a brisee was also wonderful and I loved the \"a la mode\" mashed potatoes on top. 

The food was so good that my sister and I decided to still order dessert. We got the pie of the day and the pastry of the day. Again, there were a lot of nuances in flavor and I could tell that the chef had put a lot of thought into what makes up the dish. Speaking of the chef-I believe her name is Tess (?), came out to see how we were doing. She was so sweet and I could tell that she was passionate about the food she made. 

Back to the food: the \"baklava\", while not authentic (on croissant dough, not phyllo) was still amazing and was served with a lemon curd whip. The pie was also good, and again, served beautifully. 

We finished our meal with a cute receipt in a book and were amazed that two lunches (with hefty portions), two desserts, and one drink came out to around $20. I would expect to pay $40 for that quality of food!

The second time we went, I took my whole family and it was a bit more underwhelming because the potatoes needed a bit more salt, service and food were a little slower,the filet mignon had chewy, tough pieces of meat, and the tomato soup way too thick and not very flavorful. The rice pudding creme brulee and grilled cheese of the day were still delicious though, and I am still giving Bistro a La Mode 5 stars because although the second trip was inconsistent with the first, the food was still great.

Also, they let you walk around the grounds of the manor so it's really quite a nice overall experience- and because we lie so close, we will definitely be back! Even if you don't live close, try it out! 

The great thing about this place is that the manor does not depend on its restaurant to keep it afloat-- meaning-- Bistro a La Mode does not sacrifice quality of food for price."}
{"text":"Loved the place!  It was 116 outside so we sat inside in total comfort. Trisha was very attentive to our needs. My wife and I shared the soup & salad \"beef & barley\" and the chicken caprese sandwiches. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"My second time here and can't say anything bad about it! Love the atmosphere and the service. I get the short ribs that melt in your mouth!  What a nice little find."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant ! Enjoyed the food and ambiance !
Great indoor and outdoor seating ."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my grandparents. It was lovely! Our food came out in great time and it was delicious. Everything on the menu sounds appetizing yet unique. The service was very good too. I can't wait to come back and try a wine and cheese tasting!"}
{"text":"The bistro has really nice ambiance outside. The food was pretty good and the sweet potato tots were great. The chicken when added to a salad didn't seem as fresh. The group I was with said that the grilled cheese was great. Overall a pleasant dining experience for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly good French restaurant tucked away in an industrial part of Mesa. Food was excellent and service good. Beautiful patio as well."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I didn't know what a board and batten was until I had heard of this restaurant. When I saw the name and looked up what it was (A type of siding for walls) I initially thought it might be some type of interior design or a home improvement type store but instead found out they offer tasty sandwiches, salads, and soup. If this naming pattern becomes more common, maybe in a bizarro world there will be a home improvement store called Bread & Butter!

The actual restaurant is right next to Stonebridge Manor and is owned by the same person. It's all very new construction and the building itself is quite a lovely sight to see, but in an odd part of town since the rest of the neighborhood aside from Stonebridge is more commercial property, and for now it's just a dirt lot right next to the building. 

There's plentiful outdoor seating as well as a nice indoor area. It was a nice day so we chose to sit outside. The menu is pretty simple, with fresh ingredients as key stars in each item. I went for the chopped salad at the recommendation of our server, and had an iced coffee to go with it.

The iced coffee was pretty good, it had no bitterness or acidic flavor and I didn't need to add any sweeteners or cream to it. The salad looked lovely and was a pre-dressed combination of romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, bacon, avocado, pepitas, chicken, and roasted corn. The dressing was the perfect amount of basil-ranch, lightly sweet and creamy. I loved the combination of flavors and textures which harmonized well together. 

Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, great food and service with a peaceful and beautiful setting.  All in the middle of a business park, hard to believe and you will forget where you are for the moment.  You should go here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is soooo cute!! Modern farmhouse type feel. All I think of is Chip & Joanna Gaines and I want their contractors info!!! Haha. But aside from the amazing ambiance, the food is delicious! My husband and I tried the braised short ribs and fried chicken, both amazing! We also ordered risotto bc we had to try it! Our server Stacey was amazing!! So knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly!! Can't wait to come back again :)"}
{"text":"I would give them 10 stars, I would have to consider this one the best Bistro's in the area. the Grown Up grilled Cheese are fantastic, the Deserts are mind blowing, Flavor's galore in everything you taste. The atmosphere of eating under the star' s really make the entire dinning experience the Best."}
{"text":"The ambiance was a five, prices were as well! I had the chicken and mushroom pot pie for $9 which was very tasting. Not too rich."}
{"text":"I love Board and Batten. I got turned on to this new restaurant while my daughter was planning her wedding at Stonebridge Manor next door (which was Feb 24th and was awesome! They are a fabulous wedding venue!). Same owner and same chef. Both of them have great pride in the food they serve. You can tell they use fresh ingredients with that flare for something extra. The short ribs are excellent! But so is everything here! I wish they would add the duck quesadilla appetizer they served at my daughter's wedding, they are delicious! The fire pits outside add a great ambiance whether here for dinner, happy hour or just to gather with friends for some drinks. I'll bet if they added live musicians this place would be packed in the evenings! I love it here!"}
{"text":"This is the best-kept secret in Mesa.  This is the kind of place that you want them to do well, so they don't go out of business.  The menu is good---options, but not so many that you are overwhelmed. In addition to their regular menu items, them have daily specials-- A Grown Up Grilled Cheese Special, a Mac and Cheese Special, Soup Special---every day!  Feeling adventurous, we tried the specials in each of these categories:  a Beef Wellington GrownUP Grilled Cheese, Bacon and Cheddar Potato Soup, and Crab Rangoon Mac and Cheese. There was nothing that disappointed.  That Beef Wellington Grilled Cheese was OUTSTANDING.  Very subtle flavors, absolutely amazing.  Crab Rangoon Mac and cheese was decadent and delicious.  Thank goodness it wasn't huge, because it was very rich. DD loved the soup. Can't wait to go again.  This place will definitely be a favorite.  The bistro is located inside Stonebridge Manor during the summer months, which is absolutely lovely.  During nicer weather, guests sit on the terrace.  Very cute."}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday for the first time and loved it! We went for their social hour and they have pretty good deals on their food and drinks. We got the sliders and sausages wrapped in a puff pastry. So good and so filling! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by multiple people. Good customer service. Really pretty place to eat inside or outside. The food was good too!"}
{"text":"Finally! An awesome new restaurant/bar/patio, almost a secret! This place knocked it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable how delicious this restaurant is! It is currently Mesa's best kept secret. You have to try the \"Grown-up Grilled Cheese\" of the day! The food is high quality and unique. It is even worth going if you need to go out of your way to get there! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Mesa! This quiet, off the beaten path garden oasis is tucked in to an industrial area with perfectly assembled, high quality lunch plates (can't attest to the breakfasts as I haven't tried them) with delicious fares in a relaxing environment. I HIGHLY recommend the chicken caprisi. Everything sounded great and the chicken delivered. Try it if you are around the Mesa area!"}
{"text":"Foodie's delight in NE Mesa. I thought I would never see the day. I don't consider many places in NE Mesa as \"foodie\" worthy but this place truly is. I had the sliders and they were extraordinary as were the sweet potato tots, and the cinnamon roll. My husband had the chopped salad that he said was great. I can only hope that cinnamon roll becomes a staple rather than a special. Off the charts!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. So happy to have a cool new place to go in east Mesa. The food and the service is great. Had the pork chop and my wife had the summer pasta. Presentation and flavors are amazing. Pineapple bread pudding for desert is awesome. Highly recommend this new restaurant for all. Such a breath of fresh air from the typical east Mesa eatery."}
{"text":"Wonderful environment and great service.  The food was good, however, you might pass on the house cabernet."}
{"text":"I would love to give this restaurant five stars, and, as far as atmosphere, food quality and service, they are spot on.  I am withholding one star in the hope of getting their attention . . . PLEASE EXPAND YOUR MENU!  I've taken two groups there.  One was for lunch.  All good, but disappointed in limited choices.  So, I took another group for dinner, hoping for more menu options.  It was even worse.  Again, what we ordered was good, but not enough choices in menu items (or varying prices) to satisfy even the majority of the group.  Everyone loved the facility, especially the inviting patio.  But consensus was, they would not return until the menu is expanded."}
{"text":"So addicted! They have funky hours because they are piloting foods for their restaurant they are opening up. All of their foods and desserts are so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine... Amazing dishes...even the pickle that came with the sandwich was unique and delicious. We enjoyed the flavored and seasonings! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Phoenix! This place is amazing! The decor is beautiful, the atmosphere is relaxing and warming, and my meal was oh-so comforting. The food was prepared perfectly and the beignets were delicious. Corbin was an awesome waiter and took great care of us. I'm already excited and expectant for my next meal at Board & Batten!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  We came here for pre Mother's Day brunch.  We had quiche, French toast, chicken salad with Brie, crepe brûlée and a wonderful salad.  I loved the atmosphere, fast service, food and the prices which were very good for the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"The most unique grilled cheese and Mac and cheese that you can find anywhere. The also have daily dessert specials that are never the same daily. Always fresh and delicious. I do think that the price per portion is off, and for the price point it should be a little better ingredient choices, like more organic non-gmo produce used. And maybe it is, but it is not advertised as such. Either way it if delicious and unique everytime."}
{"text":"My wife has been talking about this place for a few months now and how deliciouso it is! I finally took her out to lunch and went to Bisto a La Mode, which is on the property of Stonebridge manor. We got there and followed the arrows to the back garden area. They don't really have a host table or anything since its not a restauraunt per se. We sat ourselves and our waiter came out from behind this gate with waters and menus. The menu is small but everything looks and sound super delish! My wife got the stuffed grilled cheese and I got the chicken caprese salad sandwich with mac and cheese with ham as my side. I was really impressed. Im not a big fan of fancy foods but this was simple and amazing! It was just the right portion size, and everything was natural. The cost was reasonable but a delicious lunch, I was telling my wife we would have spent a lot more at a local restaurant. Ill be heading back here whenever I have a chance!"}
{"text":"Place is absolutely beautiful and clean. The service is excellent.  Will be back.there is a small airport next door but can't hear noises from the plains flaying"}
