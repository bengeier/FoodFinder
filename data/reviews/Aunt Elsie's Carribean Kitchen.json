{"text":"Awesome old school Scarborough joint! Love the new microwaveable to go containers, you can tell they are considerate of their customers needs. You take out, bring it home and then heat it up!"}
{"text":"Do not just ignore and underestimate sketchy-looking strip malls. Hidden gems lie within these environment! NO WORD OF A LIE.

Aunt Elsie's is a grocer and take-out place selling awesome, delicious food, baked goods, drinks, frozen fish, canned goods and other bric-a-brac paraphernalia from the Caribbean. 

My girl who works across the street at Ze Khub told me about this place. We went here together and she ordered dumplings, and my... you can ask them to put oxtail gravy on that shit! OMG. She also had their patty and cocobread. In zis case, I opted out for a small jerk chicken dinner... 

The dumplings were so fluffy and almost crispy in the outside, its not that salty and goes great when you soak it with the oxtail gravy, YUM.

The jerk chicken, look at the pic I posted. That's a SMALL dinner. SMALL. It came with a piece of plantain too and rice and peas. The chicken was moist and tasted great. I just wish it was a little bit more spicy and that I ordered it with oxtail gravy in the rice. But overall, it was very satisfying and I would love to buy food from this place again."}
{"text":"This place looks feels and smells like a convenience store. Don't be fooled they do serve great jerk chicken and Caribbean food.

The Jerk chicken was nice and moist on the inside and well spiced and slightly crispy on the outside chicken skin. The rice and beans tasted great with the option of ox tail gravy on top. Other dishes such as king fish and ox tail is a must try for me next time I try this place. 

The line may be long and the ordering process may be a bit weird. You wait it line to order your food at the cashier as she repeats the order through a walkie talkie and someone brings the order from the back. You wait for your order near the narrow entrance where a runner hands you off your food."}
{"text":"Was in the hood and actually wanted to buy some beer at the store but stumbled onto this grocery/convenience store/takeout place.  The menu had pretty much your standard Caribbean fare.  Also on display they had johnny cakes, salted cod fritters, other fried items & cheesecake. I decided on the jerk chicken which came with rice & peas, fried plantain & oxtail gravy which I asked for extra with no additional charge, nice!  Well taste wise it was a mild version of jerk which would be ideal for people who can't handle the heat.  The chicken was tender and juicy and tasty from the extra gravy which made the entire meal enjoyable. A few shots of hot sauce would have made this just right. In the end my hunger was satisfied, no complaints. Off to the beer store..."}
{"text":"I have to thank fellow Yelpers for this one. A very unassuming store front in a Scarborough strip mall, with delicious take out.

I ordered the goat curry and my husband had the king fish dinner. The Small portion was more then enough for 1, leaving me wondering just how big Large must be. Food was made to order, full of flavour and they don't skimp on the meat.

Keep in mind this is not a sit down restaurant, but rather a grocery style store, take away only.

The woman behind the counter was very engaging and helped us with the order process because we were clueless. She suggested we try the cod fritters and I'm so glad we did, yum!"}
{"text":"This jerk chicken is perfect! Medium spice & super moist. I couldnt stop eating it. Rice & peas were exceptional too. A small was almost too much food for me but I finished it anyways. I would definately reccommend this spot."}
{"text":"Dang it I love this city as there's a ton of amazing foodie gems in the most unassuming places. And perhaps no where is that more evident then in Scarborough.

Personally I rarely find myself in corporate places like Timmy's, Mickey D's, Boston Pizza, etc...  To me food is about soul and culture.  Mom and Pop places are the ones that I love to frequent.

And Aunt Elsie's Caribbean Kitchen is just the place that I love.  A small family run shop, Aunt Elsie's is a Caribbean takeout joint, catering and grocery store.  There's some amazing home cooked Jamaican fare such as the popular jerk chicken, oxtail and curry goat, but also some serious fare such as cow foot, tripe and beans and manish water.....WTF is manish water???  I don't know but I will order that next time!!

The food is really good here.  Ordered a large curry goat and jerk chicken dinner with rice and peas with a side of plantains.  F*ck me it was good!  The meal came out pipping hot, the jerk chicken tender and that curry goat was to die for!!  

They also has some items such as fried fish, spicy shrimp and a ton of of other Caribbean fare that will bring you back to Jamaica.

While there grab some groceries such as Scott bonnet peppers, plantains or their amazing wall of sauces and other items that they source directly from the Caribbean.  They also carry Allan's and Michidean Patties, hardo bread, salted codfish and a ton of other items.

This is a fantastic store that is also a meeting place for regulars and I got to chat with one of them about what is good to try.

The only bad thing is that I wish I was closer or I would be hitting this joint all the time.

5/5.  Well deserved!!"}
{"text":"When drive here,  you will feel as if you were transformed and not in Toronto anymore.  Yes, the area is dodgy.  The area feels third world.  The parking area is dirty and it feels poor.

I heard about Aunt Elsie on the CBC and decided to try it out.   As you walk inside, it is a small grocery store that sells a bunch of Caribbean goods.  You would never know that they sell one of the best jerk chicken in Toronto.

The owners seem to be chinese.  They probably lived in Jamaica since I heard the chinese population is pretty big in Jamaica.

I ordered the jerk chicken to go.   It took about 5 minutes for my order to be fulfilled.   Total was about $10.   When I opened up the takeout container, I smelled the amazing smell coming at me.  The jerk chicken was tender and the rice that came with it was really good too.   medium spicy and very moist.  Amazing deal!   Too bad that it's kind of far away from me but I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Good food.  My only complaint is that the containers they use give you less food for the price of the product. Everywhere else uses the styrofoam ones. Either way, the black ones can't recycle."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, friendly people and great food!

I recommend the jerk pork or chicken and get a soursop cheesecake on the side"}
{"text":"3 words: yummmmy, yum, yum!!! 20minutes before they close I went in there for a quick take out for one hungry tummy. Proprietors were still all smiles and welcoming and the jerk chicken dinner on rice and beans did not disappoint. The included two slices of fried plantain was a good side. Must have on your order is to request nicely to drench it up with their free oxtail gravy. Only negative was the fork that came with the order was small and flimsy but I had to eat it at home anyways as the Raptors beat Miami Heat on game two!!!"}
