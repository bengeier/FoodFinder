{"text":"Nice place, standard price wise.
Service was really slow though."}
{"text":"Always a good value meal and a very enjoyable place to have a few drinks.
I have been going to this location for years under different names but Shirley and George the current owners have done a great job.
The regulars are always pleasant and Hi to Carey the daytime bartender and Cindy who I see the odd time on weekends"}
{"text":"If I'm working late i can usually find one of my buddies here and have a pint and split a pizza and catch the sport du jour on the TV.  Its a good place to kick back after a hard day before going home.  They have a fairly regular crowd, and the pub food is typical, and so far so good.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I would steer clear of here!
The food is never anything that resembles fresh... hardly edible. 
The bar is quite filthy and the service takes far too long!
I've given this place a few tries due to the fact that some of my pals are regulars here.
I think there are many wonderful restaurants in this area. Why waste your time here?"}
{"text":"A great little place, close to home and easy to get out for a quick bite or a drink. Comfortable and relaxed with great and friendly staff and a good menu with many options to satisfy any appetite. The food is good and fresh and the prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for late night drinks on Halloween. It was empty and the kitchen was closed but they were still serving drinks.

Staff: Service was is great. They were friendly and were attentive making sure we had something to drink. Couldn't ask for anything else.

Ambience: Had some good old pub furnishings and televisions airing the hockey games and a couple of dart boards too. They even had a couple of sofa seating which made me want to come back when I have a smaller party.

Since the kitchen was closed we didn't get any food but if you want drinks on a Saturday night this is a great place!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I moved into the area 15 years ago. The food is pretty standard pub flare, but its good. This place still has the best wings I've ever had, they are large, crispy and tasty. The prices are pretty good. Overall, food, service and prices of food is good. This place should be busier than it usually is."}
