{"text":"The restaurant was good when I finally found it. Even with the orange accents it is hard to spot from Camelback Rd. That is not a big deal in the age of gps. I had to park in the garage which they will validate. I ordered the pancakes and tought they were outstanding. The burritos looked really good as well. The outdoor patio area is very large and is great on a nice day of course when it's not too hot outside. I will definitely be back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place yet, what are you waiting for?  First of all, nicest employees EVER. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and well taken care of. The woman taking our orders was so polite and helpful. We were checked on multiple times and everyone was equally great. Next, the FOOD!!!!  Holy moly...  GET THE AZ SUNRISE BRIZZA!  Seriously.  It may have been the best breakfast food item I've ever had. My boyfriend got the Chili Verde Burrito and was really pleased with it. The only downside is the parking may be a tiny bit tricky if you aren't familiar with the area, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"MMMM, mmmm, MMMM!! My tastebuds are always happy when visiting any Scramble location in the valley. I am so excited that they opened one right around the corner from my home now at 24th Street and Camelback! 

They have some of the old faves like Blueberry stuffed french toast made with baguettes that are to die for and the Costa Burrito that my husband loves. Yet, now they have more choices - like the Soyrito Burrito that was super tasty and just the perfect size and my husband tried the (new for us at least) Cowboy brizza that I stole a couple bites from it was so very good. 

The atmosphere is always pleasant, clean, speed of service is always on point and the staff are always happy and helpful. Also, they are DOG FRIENDLY! Every one of their locations are, woof! The patio is a great, spacious size for you and your furry friends and they will make sure to bring some H2O to hydrate your loved one. LOVE!

They have a few spots near the front of the restaurant with signs that say reserved for Scramble, but never fear there is a parking garage not far from that has visitor spots available and the oober friendly staff will validate for you!"}
{"text":"Love the Benedict's. Restaurant is clean, airy & has a nice patio for seating. This is my 2nd time here. I would have given 5 stars but for the following reasons : 
1. Parking is limited.
2. Restaurant is hard to find. 
3. This restaurant is a 'self service' restaurant. You pay at the cashier, order your food & they bring it to you. & yet they ask for a tip on the credit card reader. They should leave it up to the customer to leave a tip on the table. 
4. There is really not much table service."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday morning and had a tasty Teluca Breakfast pizza- jalape√±o cream cheese on top made it especially yum. You order at the counter, self serve drinks, etc. Staff was all very nice. Inside was brand new, design was modern and cleans. Biggest issue was there are a lot of TVs, which isn't my favorite. It's not a sports bar, we don't need to watch tv from any angle. But also they were showing almost all World Cup- fine- and Fox News. Gag. I lost my appetite pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I love scramble, prior to this I've  only been to the 7th street and Peoria location. So when I found they were opening one in the biltmore area, naturally I was excited to check it out! How impressed I am with this location. The out door patio faces a shaded court yard covered by big droopy trees filled with bird chirps, mix with the music and high pace busy camelback road it all meshed perfectly! The interior had so many different options of coffee, hot sauces, condiments, and a filtered sink for you to fill your water cup. Everyone that walked by who worked here approached us with warm smiles and upbeat customer service. Thank you for a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Service was good, breakfast place doesn't know how to make poached eggs (not cooked), sent them back & asked for scrambled eggs, it was an omelette not scrambled at all. Eggs were inedible, rubbery & oily. I also ordered sausage patties, they had pooled oil/grease on top. The outdoor patio was nice."}
{"text":"Loved this location! The inside and outside seating is abundant. The vegan menu is perfect also the fact that they have soy milk for coffee is exceptional! My first visit I got the Vegan French toast and it was delicious. Give this location a shot especially since there is free parking."}
{"text":"Really good food and lots of options. I like that you can just chill here after you eat and refill your own coffee. It's the perfect mix between self serve and having a waiter since they bring the food to your table. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff was friendly.

The hell with any other menu recommendation from here: GET THE TOLOCA WITH BACON!

(it's a breakfast pizza [brizza])"}
{"text":"Gross and bland is the best word to describe the food and staff will give you the smiling stink eye if they want to turn over a table.  I ordered an omelette with a cafe mocha.  It was almost $18.  So my expectations were high.  Big mistake.  My mocha was brought out with a bitter espresso taste and no chocolate.  That is until I finished it.  It was all at the bottom.  Damn annoying!  They brought out my omelette with potatoes and toast.  The omelette was so dry and tasteless it was like eating a large rice cake with meat chunks.  The potato's had no seasoning at all.  

Then after about 45 minutes my friend and I got the stink eye with a weird Damien Omen smile from one of the staff while we were chatting.  I won't be back-ever.

Lastly, when you pay by credit card they ask for gratuity and make the selection set up so it's difficult to not have to select an amount.  Why would you set up asking for gratuity before your customer has received service?  This place struck out on everything except the outdoor seating.  That was the one nice thing about this experience."}
{"text":"Cute new little breakfast joint. Nice healthy options. Staff is not as friendly/helpful as they could be but this is mostly self-serve so what do you expect?"}
{"text":"I thought the eggs were a little over cooked for my taste but the Phoenix Omelette has very good flavor"}
{"text":"I was completely unimpressed by this restaurant. There are plenty, much better breakfast joints nearby. Scramble claims it beats its competitors by  its \"quick service\" which is completely untrue. You have to wait in a line for about 20 minutes before you even order, then wait an additional 20-30 minutes for your food. They also claimed their orange juice is freshly squeezed, it's not. Their pancakes are subpar, and their hash browns taste old. The only reason I gave them a 2 instead of a 1, is because the servers were nice. But we won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Very good food. Expect for the fact that I found a piece of wood in my food and choked on it."}
{"text":"I like the decor and ambiance but food is average. The staff is super friendly and courteous. I had a latte which was decent. Service was quick. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"Sooo glad they finally opened something next to my office building.  I tried with place with one of my coworkers the other day and was very happy with the chicken sandwich.  Food quality was great and I LOVE the ice tea and condiments Wall. The dining room is light and airy and comfortable despite the metal chairs.  And I love the bathroom. The sink is amazing - soap wash and dry all at the same faucet! Love it!"}
{"text":"Let's start with atmosphere.. on point! Inside and outside seating. Parking was a little confusing but that's not the restaurant fault so can't hold them to that.  Service... on point! Autumn knew the menu, greated me with a smile, and answered my questions perfectly she was quick friendly and attentive.  Also, I had questions on some of the juices and kambucha they offered and kelsie was an absolute wealth of knowledge and led me to the perfect drink. And mot to mention she was so kind! These ladies are amazing for this place. Id come back to see them again. Now the food. So many gluten free options for my boyfriend, and vegan/vegetarian  options for me. I got protein pancakes and man were they good! Fluffy, soft and delicious. My boyfriend has the 2 eggs anyway comes with hash browns, toast, 2 eggs, and bacon or sausage. He got the gluten free toast and he really actually liked it. They aren't always the best toasts when gluten free. All in all I would come back here all the time. I like the come in and order your own food and sit where you want kind of place. You get your own drinks plenty on coffee and teas to choose from and also adult drinks! Yummy yummy try this place you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had a nice breakfast on a Sunday morning. Outside seating next to a grassy open area. Dog friendly patio. Cafeteria style ordering. Lots of Benedict type plates. Many GF options which was nice for our crew. Super friendly staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Scramble and so happy they have opened another location. Same great food and brand new space with amazing floor to ceiling windows! It has a great fresh vibe to it but still comfortable and welcoming. Amazing Vegan options and something for everyone on the menu. What's best about this location is they have adult beverages, whoo hoo!!!  I always said having a mimosa with my Alma Brizza would be heaven and now I can have that :)"}
{"text":"I love scramble. Love. Love. I'm lucky enough to live practically walking distance to one but I definitely wanted to try this new one out. It didn't disappoint. The mushroom and spinach was delicious. And with the variety of hot sauces, it just made it all better. They have the best breakfast blend coffee. It has this weird chocolate after taste. I cannot say enough good things about scramble! 

Open one on the west side!"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes in line to order 18 more minutes to get food. I asked for burger cooked med. Cashier said ok. It was well done like shoe leather. Thin patty to begin with, the thick tomatoe slice was thicker than the burger meat. Pretty certain menu ingredients didn't say onion, but it came with onions. Dislike onions, server asked if all ok, after explaining burger, she said we do medium well, why the cashier didn't tell me? So u can get a slimy runny undercooked egg on a burger but not a pink medium meat? where is the justice? SMH,  Now the side soup was excellent. That's why they get a bonus star."}
{"text":"We love Scramble! My partner and I have been big fans ever since we tried their first location on 7th St. It seems as though lots of people agreed with us since they have become busier and opened two additional locations!

On our way home from California today we decided to stop for brunch and at the last minute I remembered this new location on Camelback Road. The space seems larger than the other locations and has a huge patio if you want to dine outside. The food is consistently good and our first visit to this location matched our expectations.

We both had omelettes with toast and hash browns. After a five hour road trip we were pretty hungry and added a side of dollar cakes to the order. They graciously made adjustments to my order and everything came out quickly. 

The only reason I didn't give them five stars was that every television, save for one, was on a sports channel. Sports is great, its the programming on the one TV that turned me off. The last TV was turned to a channel purports to report news, but actually twists the story to fit their ideology every chance they get and has zero tolerance for diversity."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey and the line does get long, but the food is consistently good, coffee flows, they have soy milk without an additional charge (all you want!), the staff are always friendly and it's a nice place to eat.  Join the loyalty club and occasionally get a free one.  I eat here all the time."}
{"text":"LOVE this spot! Tons of delicious options for everyone, with amazing customer service. The patio is super cute especially in the spring when the trees are blooming their flowers..and it's dog friendly! But no smoking allowed  

I recently adopted a vegan diet and am very appreciative of the Vegan SECTION offered (yes an entire section! not just one or two options like some other places). The employees are very knowledgeable about their items, as I ordered the dirty chai the girl told me \"the chai powder used is milk based, but we can make a vanilla almond milk latte for you\"....Freaking  awesome!! Thank you!

I've had the soyrizo burrito both times I've been and loved it, however I prefer traditional hash over the sweet potato hash. My boyfriend tried my burrito the first time we went, and ordered it the second time we visited  
The orange slice they put on the side is my favorite, silly I know, but they are always so sweet and delicious. They have a ton of condiments to choose from, as well as an array of sweeteners for your drinks including honey, stevia, and raw sugar. There are a bunch of TVs hung around the inside playing different things like news, sports, cooking, etc. so everyone can be as informed/entertained as they like. 

Also, if you get a chance check out their bathroom because they have the coolest sink setup! 

Last but not least.....they also have mimosas ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot. The food was delicious. Bottomless coffee and brizza was delicious. The staff was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great location! Huge patio! I ordered the meat lovers scramble and the sidewinder! Yes they serve some tasty adult beverages at this location. Stopped in before a spring training game and was in and out very quickly.  Food came out fast and hot!!  5 stars Scramble!"}
{"text":"Great location, patio is open with shade from umbrellas and nearby Palo verdes. Really digging the bright orange popping color, it makes me happy and oddly, hungry. It's counter service, the menu lining the wall where you place your order. You can grab drinks out of a cooler on the way to the register where you'll order breakfast and bloody Mary's and mimosas and coffee drinks and anything else your heart desires for the perfect brunch. Scramble does not disappoint with the hot sauce selection! The condiment/silverware/napkin station is loaded with all the things. It's counter service, but food gets delivered to wherever you decide to hunker down and there's plenty of friendly staff walking around keeping the place clean and offering assistance. The food was full of flavor! I didn't even need the Cholula or Tapatio I grabbed (but I sauced it up any way) I went with a vegan scramble with regular hashbrowns. Hashies were perfecto. I had a coffee and Rattlesnake Bloody Mary to drink. Wowza. I now know why it's called the Rattlesnake, pure venom in that thing. Spicy spicy spicy. Muy caliente, mi amigos. Overall: there are a plethora of options on the menu, the food is flavorful , the WiFi is free, the place is clean comfy and casual, great for families and groups!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great place at the Biltmore! I love the amount of vegan and health options you have. We had a nice birthday brunch for my team (national bank of Arizona). Love the vegan French toast. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome.  It is set up like a Pei Wei so you order at the counter and then they bring it out to you quickly.  They use local ingredients and have some unique/unexpected items like a Cereal Killer Smoothie line-up or Brizza breakfast pizzas plus your omelettes, burritos, pancakes (even multigrain), etc.  I didn't try the Vegan options but I saw they have a number of Vegan items.  Huge outdoor patio next to a grass area.  Glad they have a location in Biltmore area.  Could never find a consistent breakfast spot in that part of town for business meetings until now."}
