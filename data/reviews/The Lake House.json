{"text":"O-M-G!  I used to go for brunch with my mother at the Inn at Lake Bonavista.  Lets just say, I've come home again!  I wanted the brunch at The Lake House to take me back to all those years of wonderful brunch in a spectacular environment.  I was definitely not disappointed.  The two different kinds of eggs benny had me giddy - I chose one and my Mother chose the other - both are fantabulous!  My hubby and stepfather chose the brisket which both spoke very highly of.  The blood orange mimosas were fantastic and the sticky toffee pudding was divine.  We will definitely be back sooner rather than later.  I can't wait to have dinner!"}
{"text":"After winning Sochi Olympic Men's Hockey Gold it was time to celebrate with brunch in the neighbourhood of Lake Bonavista.  It was the opening weekend for this venue and many tables were vacant.  Perhaps our Olympic compadres were resting in their nice warm beds post win?  My prediction is that you will find it difficult to reserve a table for brunch once word gets out.  The Lake House is awesome both in food and view.  The brunch menu includes benedict, brisket, brioche, boar, bison, and blood oranges.  How does one choose between Steak & Eggs (grilled beef medallions and mascarpone scrambled eggs) and Pulled Wild Boar Mac & Cheese, and Chocolate Cream Cheese Filled Brioche French Toast? Tip: One does not choose but stays and eats for many hours. With the exception of the roast potatoes, which we found unexceptional, every main was composed of high quality protein and harmonious flavours.  Between courses we sank into our comfy chairs and gazed into the flame as we cozied up to the fireplace.  It was a chilly weekend so the view of the lake was winter white with two brave ice skaters and a couple of ice fishing shelters for entertainment.  If you are a resident of Lake Bonavista - lucky you."}
{"text":"I live in Edmonton and I was told by some friends that they had heard excellent comments about this restaurant.  They were unable to get reservations because the restaurant was fully booked at the time.  My daughter lives in Calgary and it's her 40th birthday on May 13.  I and other family members are traveling from Edmonton to celebrate with her.  As such, back in the middle of March, I made a reservation for eight people for May 13th.  A couple of friends in Calgary are also joining us so I called today to confirm the time of the reservation.  I was informed that they have no record of my reservation and furthermore, there is a private function there on Friday.  The woman I spoke to insisted that it's their policy to never take ala carte reservations that far in advance.  She also inquired whether I knew the identity of the person who took my reservation.  Well, of course not!  Does anyone bother to note the name of the person when they make a reservation?  I had made a point at the time I made the reservation to inform them that I would be bringing a cake and they said they would be charging extra and I said no problem.  She said their \"system\" has absolutely no record of me at all.  I'm not dreaming this up!  I think they booked the private function after I had made the reservation and thought nothing of \"bumping\" my insignificant group of eight.  How unprofessional and insulting."}
{"text":"This is a place Not to eat. The food is over priced and the service is the worst I have ever had. I can remember when this was the best place in the city, but those days of Inn on Lake Bonavista are long gone. If you go, remember the water costs you a buck per person, even before you look at the menu. I am not sure if they had coffee as the server never asked if I would like one."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dining experience. We were there with a large group for a rehearsal dinner. The service was great, friendly staff, and food came out in a timely manner. The food itself was delicious. The Halibut is a must try and their sticky toffee pudding is complimented well with pineapple. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends on weekend and place was quite busy. Has a great atmosphere and a warm and inviting feel with fire place blazing away! View of the lake is great, but food is even better. Had the caribou and risotto mains, both were quite good. Sticky toffee pudding ended the night right! Great place for visit with friends or romantic dinner."}
{"text":"We made reservations and upon arrival I noticed that the servers/waitresses were not smiling. I specifically requested to seat near the lake view and I was satisfied with that. The lunch menu wasn't too intimidating in sheer quantities to choose from. We tried an appetizer called Steamed PEI Mussels, and it was delicious, strong seafood taste with a dill after taste that makes you crave for more. I wish there was a bowl of rice to go with it as I would be happy just eating that.  For the main, we ordered Lake House Made Egg Pappardelle, Bison & Caribou Game Burger, Grilled Beef Top Sirloin Escalope, and a lunch of the day, baked ham sandwich with melted cheese and soup of the day (I can't remember, but it had caramelized onions, fennel, and potatoes). I highly recommend them all, but due to our stomach sizes, you can share one with another person. The one that stood out the most would be the bison & caribou game burger as it was juicy all throughout upon biting and the blueberry added into it didn't make me get sick of eating the burger, but made me crave for more. The pappardelle had more meat to pasta ratio which was a plus for me. The baked ham sandwich was done perfectly with the melted cheese, saltiness and the selection and softness of the bread complimented the dish as a whole. As for the Grilled Beef Top Sirloin, you can't go wrong with that if you are craving for steak.  Overall, the price was well priced for lunch and I would go back again in different season."}
{"text":"It was time for a celebration and after hearing that The Lake House is owned by the same group that Bar C and Divino, I thought this would be a great location to check out - I was not disappointed!  I really like the space; we got to sit by the window which overlooks the lake, although it was dark by the time we got there it was still romantic, especially with the roaring fireplace just to the left of us.  Our server came around a few times and was attentive to our needs, overall good but not amazing service.  The food though, that was fantastic. We shared a cheese and charcuterie board, mussels and a salad - I wouldn't have changed a thing about any.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was that it was very loud and it was very hard to hear each other to due other peoples talking . Would love to come back, I heard brunch is a good scene."}
{"text":"The bad:  1. Too pricey for the food you receive. Especially since the food was not that good. I have no problem paying for food that excites my taste buds, but when my taste buds revolt and want to run out of my mouth or I wonder if I am eating cardboard, I do not like to pay an exorbitant amount for food.   2. The food was either not very flavourful and bland or the spices did not go with the food.  I was disappointed by every single item we ordered. Look at the ravioli dish in the photos: it looks like the bubbles you blow out of your mouth when you play with your spit as a kid. Quite frankly, it looked like someone spit in my food then made bubbles with it. I am sure it is meant to be fancy but it made the dish look unappetizing and it tasted terrible too. Every single dish was an epic disappointment to my mouth.   3. The staff and service was average. Our waiter was not very friendly and barely smiled.   The good:  1. The view of the lake was beautiful. We watched the sunset as we ate our unsatisfying dinner.   2. The interior of the restaurant is very beautiful and nicely decorated.  Conclusion:  This is on my 'Places to Avoid' list: Go watch the sunset somewhere else and your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"I'm giving the lake house 4 stars only because of how good their risotto was! The leak and cauliflower risotto was such a pleasant surprise, a perfect combination of flavours and texture, was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the beef ribeye which had quite a lot of fat that had to be separated but otherwise cooked perfectly. We ordered the charcuterie board for an appetizers which was kind of a disappointment. The selection of meats was nice but the bread that accompanied them was quite stale and thick. The complimentary bread actually worked a lot better.   Luckily we had a table by the window which gave us a beautiful view but was a little bit on the cold side due to some winds, would be good to have some more heaters around that area.   Altogether a pretty good experience just won't order the charcuterie board next time!"}
{"text":"Three of us went out for dinner last night at The Lake House.  We all came away thinking the same thing . . . they still don't have it quite right.  Something is wrong and it is hard to pinpoint but I'll share my guesses.    For those of us in the south, the location is wonderful.  There aren't a lot of fine dining choices out of the core and this is definitely fine dining, aka expensive.  More about that later.  The old Inn on Lake Bonavista offered fabulous views of the lake and an intimate calming environment that just begged you to sit back, relax, stare out at the water, daydream and enjoy good food and friends.  The Lake House is in the same building and has the same views but they missed the mark on this one.  The floors are hard, the chairs are hard, the ceilings are high, the windows have no fabrics and so the place is LOUD!  Noisy, boisterous, yell at your neighbor loud.  Even the staff sidle up close when you are ordering so they can hear you.  The tables are close together but it is so loud you can't really hear each other at your own table much less the next.    The lighting is dim and romantic.  Tiny cube candles on each table and huge antler chandeliers turned down low.  The print on the menu is tiny and we saw a few cell phone flashlights being used to read.  We passed the cube candle around to illuminate our menu and frankly we still had to guess on the details because we just couldn't see.    But on to the important parts.  The menu is a blend of seafood and local food.  Alberta lamb, Alberta beef, and an amazing charcuterie board - my favourite part of the whole meal I admit.   Maybe the seafood is a nod to the lake but the scallops that I had, although beautifully cooked, were served with a mish mash of flavours and textures that didn't seem to like each other- pork cheeks, mushrooms, truffle potato gnocchi and tomato.  They also offer oysters, a fish plank, crab cakes, mussels, salmon and lobster mashed potatoes.  Seriously a lot of seafood on offer.  The boys at my table both ordered the Ribeye but I wonder if the other seafood dishes are just as confused as the scallops.  The Angus Beef was beautifully cooked but I think it sat on the warmer for a bit because the demi glaze was a bit congealed.  The beets were Golden beets but they were not the sweet, yummy, tender little spring goldens, they were the big, too long in the ground, woody flavoured fall beets.    The wine selections at The Lake House are superb.  I am always limited to the wine by the glass menu as none of my men drink wine.  It always gives an interesting perspective.  I peaked at the by the bottle selections and I was impressed.  A nice variety of Spanish, Italian, Californian and Canadian (yay!) wines on offer.  I had a beautiful Cab Sauv blend from Italy $13glass/$55 bottle and a Tempranillo from Spain $12glass/$51 bottle but would have loved to see a Canadian Red offered by the glass too.    Dessert was sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious.  Sweet and satisfying served with a lovely little scoop of vanilla ice cream, just as it should be.    Our server was sweet.  Not particularly trained or professional but sweet and kind and discreet.  It took a bit of a memory act for her to tell us about the charcuterie but she got it out in the end.  I think she might have been newish.  The timing from the kitchen was a bit off but the place was packed, and it was Friday night, and there was a wedding party in the next room.  We had quite an extended wait between our appetizer and our mains and again after.  We ordered dessert and coffee and the dessert arrived in good time but the coffee was a long time after that.  I know because I ordered the dessert and waited for the men to get their coffees before diving in.  I was staring at that toffee for a L O N G time !!!  So final Impressions.  It is a bit confusing.  The food was good but not great.  At $36 and $39 a main they really need to be great.  The place is loud but the décor is intimate and romantic, except the chairs which do not encourage you to linger.  I think with a few tweaks they will get it right.  I think they should hire a designer.  A real designer.  Not a decorator or someone who has an eye.  A professional who will come in and just fix it.  It is so close but it isn't quite right.  The same in the kitchen.  They are so close and I want to try it again but I think I will wait a bit for them to get the kinks out.  Let me know what you think when you go."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I went for brunch with a girl friend. We both had the banana bread French toast and it was delicious. Fresh bananas and warm blackberries and raspberries with a Chantilly cream. Would definitely go back and test of their wine selection with a meat and cheese board. Service was also wonderful. Great place all around."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited this restaurant. I   went last night and what I enjoyed most was the view over the ice skating pond. I watched some kids playing hockey well after the sun went down. It was pretty magical. That aside, I didn't absolutely love the appetizers but they were good, I did love the scallops very much, and the dessert was pretty decent too. The ambiance is worth the price and the food is yummy overall."}
{"text":"Always great and a beautiful location with a great view. Foods delicious and service is typically good:-)"}
{"text":"Awesome spot with some alternative Canadiana. Quite possibly the best bison roast I have ever experienced. My personal opinion is that bison and elk are key western Canadian meats that should be enjoyed in a more widespread fashion; and that it's unfortunate that the selection is so limited here. The Lake House has a great selection however.   Service is great. I asked for wine pairings with our appetizers and mains and was not disappointed. It's a little spendy; expect around $140 for two if you plan on wine and no dessert."}
{"text":"Came here during a road trip in Canada. I was celebrating my birthday and also was looking for a restaurant that had elk on their menu.   Phenomenal experience. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. The bartender (think his name was Jay) was very nice and engaging. Never had to ask for more water, was great about remarking for each course, and kept me entertained the whole evening.   Started with the tartare. Beautifully plated and the flavors were amazing.  Definitely make sure you get a little bit of everything in one bite!  Beet salad was delicious as well. Three words... goat cheese marshmallows! My only comment was that it could have used a bit more acid/citrus.  The elk Wellington was outstanding. Perfectly cooked, and just the right balance of savory/sweet/earthy/meaty and the puff pastry was so crisp and flaky.  And don't forget dessert. The mocha chocolate cake was rich and decadent and perfect end to a meal. They were even sweet enough to write happy birthday on it for me. I know I'm gushing a bit but this was one of my standout meals of this trip. Highly recommend if you're in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! We found this place by word of mouth. What a gem! It's nestled right beside Lake Bonivista providing and amazing view/atmosphere as you dine. The service was fantastic and the food was top notch. We all shared mussels as an appie. The sauce was creamy yet flavorful but not overbearing so the fresh flavors of the mussels they used was noticed. I had the caribou. The meat was so tender! I was expecting some gameness to it but not at all! The flavors will are well balanced. The rest of my family is usually skeptical and picky when it comes to fine dining but they all raved about their dishes! The price is fair considering it is fine dining so I would definitely recommend this place for special occasions.cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Rustic and elegant!The beautiful lake surrounding the place be it either a skating rink  in winter or a lovely water in summer made this place a night out away from the city. I had a superb complete dining with friends. The food was excellent! Service was okay. Just a little attention to details regardless of the traffic. We were three but the bread and butter was only two. It was \"okay\". A 4 star is what I can. I Bison Soparasatta for my mains, Toffe for my dessert, Sorbet peach bellinni cocktail is good."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on 3 occasions now and every time we have had a great experience. Food is great and the service is awesome. Highly recommend the wild bore."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Great service. Great food. Not a chicken finger and fries place. Dinner was great with true Alberta food. Brunch was amazing for Mothers Day. I'm very glad \"The Inn\" has turned into something so great after it's horrible interlude as something else."}
{"text":"Nestled on a picturesque setting and smartly decorated with modern contemporary decor, this place is an excellent venu for any special occasion, perhaps even fit for a wedding.   The food was excellent though the service was a little slow. The quality of the food was exceptional. Bring your camera and be prepared to take some great shots as you enjoy your dinner as you admire the beautiful sunset over the lake."}
{"text":"Ate here recently for my birthday. We really enjoyed it. Delicious crab cakes and wine and I had the scallops and gnocchi for a main. Service was great. It's not cheap but we thought it was worth the price! (Except the wine! Their mark up on wine was retarded)."}
{"text":"Truly a five-star experience. Firstly, the view! Hard to believe you're close to Chinook shopping centre when all you can see from the wall of beautiful windows is the expansive Lake Bonavista. It was a joy to dine there (the staff do everything the can to make sure you get a nice view). The service was amazing, the food amazing and the ambiance was OFF THE HOOK. I had the steak...perfection. My partner had the vegetarian pasta dish and, while he was full after just a few bites (it's a heavy dish), he couldn't stop eating it and felt bloated for the rest of the evening! Even he would attest that it was completely worth it.  Speaking of worth it, the prices are just a notch above Earls and you get creative, farm fresh dishes, service from professionals that are wearing more than a sports bra and the view!!! Love it and will go back so often they will know me by name."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service from Jessica. Superb atmosphere, such as a view of the entertaining ducks on the water and rustic lake house decor including the antler chandeliers and big roaring fire in the fire place.  We began with the Wild Boar appetizer, more details to come."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday Brunch. Yum!   Every element on the plate of the Duck Confit Croquettes was delicious and beautifully presented, the poached egg was perfect! The Mixed Grill was very nice, the beef was juicy and tender, the pork a little tough.  We were so happy with our meal that we decided to push on and order dessert.  Had the sticky toffee pudding - absolutely divine! and pumpkin creme brulee, very nice, but not as good as the pudding.  The server was sweet and attentive.  The view is beautiful. We will happily return for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food was ridiculously good. The decor was beautiful.... Giant chalet fireplace, antler chandeliers, etc. Waitress was a pro. Will def go back. The miso butter on the black cod was killer. YUM!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Rocky Mountain Charcuterie Board - Air dried Alberta Beef, Cured Duck Breast, Wild Boar Mortadella, Elk Sausage, Bison Soparasatta, Aged Ham, Mustard Melon, Ram Ram, Mustard, Pumpernickel Bread Sous Vide Macintosh Apples Compote - Chewy Breakfast Cookies, Chinook Honey Yoghurt Banana Bread French Toast Peanut Butter Mousse, Strawberry Jam, Peanut Brittle Warm Apple Ginger Cake Sweet Potato Ice Cream, Salted Caramel Sauce  Located on beautiful Lake Bonavista, in mid-January a pond hockey dream with more leisurely skaters making a path around the perimeter, The Lake House has long been considered one of the most picturesque dining rooms in all of Alberta, their Sunday Brunch a popular destination for locals and visitors alike.  Managed by Canadian Rocky Mountain Resorts, a space previously titled \"The Ranche\" rebranded to focus more on the scenery visible through large windows around the back, those visiting The Lake House will immediately be stuck by the grand dining room featuring a large stone mantle and chandeliers made of elk antlers, the all-glass Wine cellar near the bar a curiosity to oenophiles while the menu features no shortage of local, seasonal ingredients.  Built on the idea of \"Rocky Mountain cuisine,\" Chef Thomas Neukom changing the menu frequently to feature the best of Western Canada's ranches and farms, it is after pleasant greeting from the hostess and a youthful server that guests are led to wood tables, the Brunch menu following a formula of Benedicts, Omelets and Hash with more lunch-like options including fried Chicken, Oysters and even a smoked Fish tray.  Taking an extensive dining agenda into account, a total of four plates selected and coursed out one at a time, brunch got started with a Bamboo tray of housemade and locally sourced Charcuterie, the cold-cured Duck, Wild Boar Mortadella and warm Elk Sausage all outperforming the Meats at highly-regarded Rouge or RGE RD in Edmonton with a portion far more appropriate to the portions as well as the quality.  Intrigued by the Sous-Vide Apple dish, essentially a DIY Granola Parfait with local Yogurt and a great balance of flavor, Chef Neukom's French Toast set a high standard for creativity by quickly searing both sides of Banana Quick-Bread before pairing it with light Mousse and a slick of housemade Strawberry Preserves plus Peanut Brittle for textural variability.  Not realizing that the full Dessert menu is offered at Brunch, a fact that *may* have swayed the rest of the order more savory - though probably not - it was on the recommendation of the server that a Saskatoon Berry Tart was set aside in favor of the warm Spice-Cake topped in stewed Apples beside crumbled Streusel forming a bed for a ball of Sweet Potato Ice Cream."}
{"text":"If you want a nice night out, where you feel like you are out of the city and away from it all...(without actually leaving the city) this is the place to go.   The menu is spectacular. The service is great and genuine. The staff are knowledgeable and make great suggestions.   Worth. Every. Penny"}
{"text":"Never would I come here for dinner because of how far away it is from my house but also because its rather expensive.   However,  I  had a gift card so that changed things.   My husband and I went all out and ordered whatever we wanted including drinks and dessert.  The food here is very tasty, and for a fancy place the portions aren't too \"tiny\", we were full after dinner and dessert.   For an appetizer I had the panko crusted spot prawns that came with crab, it was phenomenal!   For dinner I had the pappardelle, which was delicate and beautiful with its flavours.  The mushrooms were a great touch.   Dessert was creme brule, which was tasty and pretty standard.      The service wasn't fantastic, my husband asked for a wine pairing with his meat and the server totally forgot about it, so he had no drink with his dinner.  She seemingly \"pretended\" she forgot and brought it out midway through the meal after we tried to get her attention for a good ten minutes.    Overall it was a nice experience, and the food was definitely tasty.   Our server did comp the wine fortunately as having it with dinner was kind of the point..."}
