{"text":"The Rotisserie House is a family-run, Portuguese barbeque (or Churrasqueira) restaurant in the Liberty Village area. Like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of d√©cor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.  They happen to be closed on the weekend, but from Monday to Thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.  They offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option. You can get a 1/4 or 1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.  The menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.  I decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their \"famous\" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.  One of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.  I do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!  Considering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.  If I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work. The prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying."}
{"text":"This place is really close by to me so its key for both delivery(when I'm hungover) and pickup.   Portions are great overall as I've tried about 5 things off the menu. I would mostly recommend the fish n chips which includes Tartar, lemon wedge and coleslaw. The fish and batter are great, while the fries seem like they're the frozen type. For $10 it's a great deal.   The chicken meals are also great. Potatoes, steamed veg and onion rings are my go to sides.    Wish they were open sundays."}
{"text":"Staff is great (super-friendly), food is authentic & excellent!  Favorite food spot and highly recommend it.  Great value!"}
{"text":"Service and the food is just awesome. I read some of the reviews (good and bad) i am surprised that some people give such an aggressive review, the average meal is $10-$12 bucks.... maybe some are being a bit too critical? I love that place and order a couple times a week."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my brother. It was a warm day so we sat outside when a table opened up, as it was pretty hot inside. Food arrived fairly quickly and we were pleasantly surprised by the amount of food we received. The food was great and the price was even better. Will definitely plan to return again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Gets super crowded during lunch but their rotisserie chicken is so good. And the fish yummm. We always get it at work on Fridays. The sides are also really good. I love their hot sauce and tzatziki. I could eat just the tzatziki so good. Portions are huge as well. Love this place."}
{"text":"I love Portuguese chicken and therefore I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered Liberty Village Rotisserie Grill makes delicious Portuguese rotisserie chicken! I had the quarter chicken with fries and a coke. My food arrived quickly and the portion size was generous. I love their version on peri-peri hot sauce. I have a feeling I will become a regular!"}
{"text":"I really like the potatoes at this place. Staff is always very friendly. It's always been very clean when I was there - clean tables and hot food. There are a few out door tables in the summer as well."}
{"text":"I work in the area and like coming here for lunch.  They have so many options under $10. Chicken is like a homey swiss chalet. Hot sauce is tasty. Greek fries are awesome.. cant wait to trh more thinga on the menu"}
{"text":"Ordered take out here a few times. Food was ready fast and quite tasty. Have only had quarter chicken combos but it's a great price for what you get! Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"What a treat! I had the Pulled Chicken Pita Wrap and WOW. The pita was perfect, it was spicy and even had some French fries on it. Defiantly a place to check out!!!!!! A Toronto hidden gem."}
{"text":"The have a long way to go until they can say they have Portugueses Chicken. Very plane tasting Just Like hospital food. No real Portuguese would eat this chicken. The hot sauce is  good price is good. Service was Great. If you want good chicken just take a walk on College street."}
{"text":"Great greek food. Try the chicken souvlaki. A very well served portion full of flavour. Simple but great food. Definetly I'm a fan. Just be patience with the lines during lunch time. It's worthwhile."}
{"text":"I rarely ever venture this far unless it is to go play football at Lamport but recently invited along for lunch i was surprised to discover this is actually a very busy lunch time destination.  My friend recommended the fish tacos and $8 for three, with a side of rice or greek salad is a decent deal.   Since then i have been back twice and had the same thing. (I seriously love fish tacos) and it has been a hit and miss each time. The first time they were delish but another time way too dry so it seems to depend on what time at lunch i come.  I do like they have a nice outside seating area, which is perfect for those long lunches."}
{"text":"Went to the Rotisserie for an early dinner.  We ordered the Pulled Chicken Poutine.  There were two sizes available.  I believe we had the regular size, which was fine by us as it was enough to share.  The Poutine was great!  The chicken was seasoned in their hot sauce mix and the fries had a unique crunchiness to them.  The cashier was friendly.  Restaurant was clean and well stocked.  Now I understand why this place is my hubby's go-to for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is really underrated. On first look it might have a sign that appears like a coffee time or what not but let me tell you there's nothing missing in the food.  As someone who eats very low sugar and carbs, this is the obvious choice of many people in the area who train and enjoy ketosis / paleo / low carb diets.  Their Rotisserie chicken is definitely their trademark. A half chicken with two sides, a container with greek salad (feta, tomato, olives, red onion) and choices of side steamed vegetables is ideal for me and priced around 10 dollars.   The hot sauce is very reminiscent of buffalo wing sauce (Frank's and Butter) but adds a great flavour on already well seasoned Rotisserie.  Believe me, at first glance it appears IFFY but after eating, it's anything but!  The patio chairs have noon lunch time SUNSHINE hitting it too for that Vitamin D!  Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek salad with chicken and it was amazing !!!!  The guy working recommended it and I'm so glad he did !    So so so yummy !    Clean restaurant, friendly service, good food. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Super tasty hidden gem!!! The last shop at the end of the street. My buddy always gets a half a chicken. It is moist and flavorful. I tried the pita chicken wrap. It was truly heavenly. Shredded moist chicken, veggies and goat cheese with their hot sauce. Made my mouth water for sure. Im not usually a huge chicken guy so for me to praise this restaurant is really saying something. Outside and inside seating, you order at the counter, and it's under $10. Who can complain about that?"}
{"text":"Busy lunch spot to pick up affordable, great tasting Mediterranean-inspired food. This place is a mom and pop shop, where you'll notice the older man cooking in the back (makes your food feel more authentic as well as it being super adorable). Every day for lunch, they have lunch specials for food items that are discounted (definitely going to help out your budget). Just cause you see \"lunch special\", don't think that you will be getting a sub-par meal. The meal is amazing but affordable. One downfall is at lunch time, the place is packed so it takes longer than expected to place & get your order. The inside is small so if you are going with a large group of coworkers, make sure to either come early before the lunch rush (11:30) or head over with the expectation that you will be picking up your food, not sitting down. Give Liberty Village Rotisserie Grill a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Deeeelicious. Reasonably priced and absolutely a joy in your mouth.   You gotta get chicken here. I don't know what else you'd get from here, but this place has some legit chicken. You get a choice between white or dark meat, or you can mix it up and get both. I would've thought that the white meat would be dry, but naw! It's succulent and juicy.   You also get some hot sauce along with your chicken. Ahhhh yeahhhhh. I don't know if it's home made or not, but it's great!   I think for sides, I had the potatoes and a coleslaw, which were both great. I'd love to try their other sides since I'm seeing some good reviews on them."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken and acceptable prices. I ordered half chicken with rice and potatoes. I eat Portuguese chicken often at Sardinha Rei Dos Frangos (SRDF) near Ossington. That's my benchmark. The chicken here is good, but it's a little subpar compared with what I can get elsewhere.   The rice and potatoes portion is noticeably smaller than SRDF. The spicy sauce they use here resembles a modified buffalo sauce more than the usual piri piri sauce. It's still delicious of course. The biggest difference is much more fundamental. I'm a fan of Portuguese chicken because they usually charcoal grill the chicken. This place doesn't seem to use charcoal. So it's almost like those grocery store chickens.   This place is still ok. Since SRDF can't be everywhere, I'm happy to settle for this place if I really crave grilled chicken and happened to be in the area. But it's not a place I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I think they changed owners but I am not too sure, but the place is not as good as before.  There is no good quality control, sometimes I get a good piece of chicken, sometimes I get a dry chicken.  Their steamed veggies also went from small well-steamed pieces that you can eat in one or two bites, to big, chunky, undercooked pieces that are so hard that you cannot cut them with plastic fork and knife.  Eating the broccoli and carrots was like trying to eat small Bonzai trees and firewood.  Their parisienne potatoes remains good (although I find more pieces undercooked now), and the sauce is still the same, I suppose if they changed owners, they got the recipe.  But they also skimp on the sauce now - they used to put the sauce in a bigger container which is just enough for a meal and good for dipping.  Now the container is much smaller and I find I run out of sauce before the end of the meal.  I wish they can raise their quality again soon.  This used to be my top lunch place because I get a good servings of veggies and protein.  But now that I can't have good veggies and the quality of the chicken becomes inconsistent, I hardly come here any more."}
{"text":"Speedy and delicious! Great ingredients, solid diner fare with way less grease. The staff are pleasant, hard workers! And the joint is spic and span. Love the food selection, location and patio. If your in the mood for fast greek or 1/4 chicken with roasted potatoes, this is the spot. Comforting, perfectly priced and a small business... will be my new go to take out dinner in the area!  (Only four stars bc I reserve 5 stars for gourmet food, yeah yeah, I'm a food snot, I know... the worst!)"}
{"text":"The Greek salad with chicken is amazing!   This place does get super busy at lunch but I have always gotten great service every time."}
{"text":"It was Nuit Blanche at 2am. Fiancee and myself found that our stomachs were empty, our legs were tired, our bodies were cold, and this place had a sign prominently displayed of \"OPEN ALL NIGHT!\" Fantastic! That's just what we need. The place was lit up with Tea lights and the owners family members took up the majority of one side of the room.  They were the only ones there when we walked in. One of the guys stood up and started asking us if we've ever been there and then discussed the specials they have. He was friendly in showing all that was prepared fresh and the different soups available. Eventually I settled on the \"Nuit Blanche Soup and Sandwich special\" 7.99 for a spicy shredded chicken sandwich with tomato and lettuce, a drink, and soup. I chose Chicken noodle which had a good flavor, but needed a little more salt for my taste. The sandwich was great and helped fill my engine. Fiancee got the chicken finger plate with fries. The breading on the fingers was excellent and the fries were even seasoned. They gave her a small ramekin of plum sauce to dip her things into which was very tasty.  We spent a good 30 minutes warming up and eating our meals, with it being so late in the evening and lit with candles it felt very homey and romantic, however I doubt this is the case all the time. I'll come back again when a chicken fix is needed."}
{"text":"Better than Swiss Chalet for sure, but best Churrasco chicken in the city? No. Not in my opinion.  The chicken here is alright, tender and tasty.  The ribs poor.  The sides that come with the chicken look, feel and taste like they're cheap frozen and mass-produced. They have a small selection of deserts and pastries that taste much like they come from Novaera (though I don't know this for a fact), they certainly aren't home made."}
{"text":"Went there based on recommendations from co-workers.  Good food? Yes Good service? Yes  Worth the hype? No Worth the price? HECK NO.  The first time I went, I had the 'pulled chicken poutine'... what a letdown. It was expensive for the portion size, and it was just fries covered in what tasted basically like Frank's buffalo hot sauce, which I'm not even a big fan of.  The second time, I got a half chicken combo (mix dark/white). The chicken plus 2 small sides should not cost me $12... that's not worth it at all. The only sauce you get is that same buffalo sauce, and that's it. I don't like hot sauce too much anyway -- I'd have preferred some sort of chicken sauce, or preferably a nice gravy.  You don't get other sauces. You don't get a drink. You also don't get a lot of whatever sides you ask for. It's not some plentiful portion for twelve bucks. I mean, most 'typical' greek places charge about $2 more than this, but the portions of chicken souvlaki + rice + potatoes + pita + tzatziki + salad are huge and extremely filling. When I eat at those places, I could easily split it into two meals -- not the case with Liberty Village Rotisserie. They'd need to have made each of my sides twice the size to MAYBE consider it worthwhile, and definitely throw in some other sauces.  The taste was good, but not like \"holy crud this is amazing\". It's a well made rotisserie chicken that's too expensive and not enough food. Sorry but not sorry. Drop the price by 30% or so, and I'd go a bit more often.  Likely won't be returning back much if at all. If my co-workers want to throw money away at places like this every few days, that is their choice..... but there are options in the area that offer better value. I can get a delicious eggplant roti at Island Foods for $5.95. I can get a much larger chicken platter with rice and wedges at nearby La Mona's. This place? Not worth your money."}
{"text":"Got the family dinner meal type thing. Full chicken, 2 sides (I went with potatoes and steamed veggies), and comes with a side of pita and tzatziki to dip in for $29. They were out of the round parisian potatoes and instead had some bigger roasted greek seasoned potatoes when I went, but they were still a perfectly fine starch component to the meal.  I'm not going to say it's my favourite rotisserie chicken joint, but It was a quick and efficient take out experience that I'll likely get on board with again when looking for something easy in the area."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for lunch in Liberty Village. Nothing fancy, no servers however the food is excellent, I usually call in to order the fish tacos, chicken poutine or grilled tilapia and the hot sauce is brilliant."}
{"text":"Great local food that's well priced in the Liberty Village, What I like most about this location is that it's away from the central part of this neighborhood.  Though the caption for this restaurant is \"Portuguese, Barbeque\" most items on the menu seemed to be Greek inspired cuisine. (was hoping for some Portuguese tarts)  The Grill! as I would call it, has an area available for both take-out and eat-in. Their prices are reasonable and their selection is great. For food I chose their Fish tacos (3 pieces) fried batter, stuffed alongside some slaw.  The presentation was bang-on good and most of all filling (which was the lightest meal on the menu). Jen on the other hand went all out and had their chicken with potato and veggies served with rice.  Presentation wise it was to her standards, the chicken itself was nice and moist, but importantly full of flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely order online (TRY RITUAL MY FRIENDS!) for this place as it can get busy at lunch! Ordered the double dark meat combo with steamed veggies and fries. The chicken was good (one thigh was delicious and moist, the other had a dry stringy drumstick), the fries are like costco fries, and the veggies (broccoli and carrots) were still crunchy and tasted fresh. They include a homemade? spicy sauce that is yummy and tastes like buffalo sauce.   Staff is super friendly! and service is quick!"}
{"text":"Good for pick up. Rotisserie chicken and salad portions are decent. One of the first places I tried when I moved to Toronto, not recommended for a sit down unless you're looking for something quick and casu"}
{"text":"After conducting two enrolment seminars today, I drove home from Windsor this afternoon.  It started raining after I hit London so it was a longer slower wetter drive.  By the time I got home five hours later, I was exhausted so stopped off at Liberty Village Rotisserie Grill, which is in our 'hood, to pick up some supper for Gord and I. We've eaten there before and like it.  Since May, it has new owners. This is the first time we've tried it since the change in ownership. Some of the less popular Portuguese items the former owners had on the menu are gone. They have been replace with fish tacos, chicken poutine, etc.  I got us each a half chicken dinner with rice and potatoes. Here's mine ... I got extra hot sauce on mine (Gord didn't want any sauce).  Everything was delicious! The chicken was so tender. I love potatoes done like this! The rice with the sauce was good.  We're definitely going to have it check it out more often."}
{"text":"Under new management? The menu's the same but the sauce isn't. It went from a nice traditional red to a neon orange concoction that didn't sit well. Probably not going to go back again."}
{"text":"I agree with previous posts. Super underrated place. Great lunch spot with rotisserie chicken, sandwiches and Fish and chips/tacos on Fridays."}
{"text":"Awesome delicious food. All staff are friendly and patient.  One of my favorite places to eat in Liberty Village.  My go to place for lunch on weekdays."}
{"text":"For what it is, place does it well! Fish tacos are a bomb dot com, and chicken comes in close second. Love there homemade hot sauce! Gets super busy at lunch, so bail the office @ 11:45am. Otherwise expect a lineup."}
{"text":"*This rating is more 4.5 than 4*  Does this place have the best churrasco-style chicken in the city? In the words of Sarah Palin, \"You Bet'cha\". This place has chicken sooooo good, I was afraid of putting up a review just because I don't want to share this place and its food with anybody else. You see this place is not well known unless you live or work in Liberty Village and the few times I was asked if I knew where it was by a stranger, I shrug my shoulders and point the opposite direction. Well I think by putting up a very favourable review I can thank the people that run this place for all the times they have made me a great meal.  The place itself is pretty small but very clean and comfortable. The staff at the counter are extremely friendly. You truly feel welcome here. I always get the grilled Portuguese-style chicken with a side of potatoes and rice. The chicken is moist and full of flavour. It is not heavily seasoned so you really get a very clean tasting chicken. With the chicken comes something only God himself could have created; piri piri sauce. The spicy/salty sauce adds another dimension to the chicken and If this were a drug and it didn't burn the nostrils, I bet this would be the drug of choice for all addicts everywhere. The potatoes and rice are well made too. Also If I really want to treat myself I go ahead and buy these little Portuguese custard tarts for dessert. Extremely good yet not overbearingly sweet. The Rotisserie House also serves wings and ribs. I yet to try the entire menu but I'm sure everything here is great based on my experience with there chicken.  The only tiny thing that hurts me about this place is that it closes early. It usually is closed by 7:30 from Monday to Saturday and it is completely closed on Sundays. I guess it is tiring making the GTA's best chicken.  I grew up with many Portuguese friends and had churrasco chicken made in many restaurants or lovingly prepared by my friend's mothers but The Rotisserie House has them all beat( I love you still Mrs. Ferriera and Grandma Sousa). The guys at  Churrasco of St Clair, Piri Piri at the Junction and all the Nando's restaurant chains in the world are not good enough for me anymore. I'm a little angry at myself for showing more people this place but The Rotisserie House is truly something special."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and fast lunch service, even when it was full. The quarter chicken combo did leave a lot to be desired, though. The vegetables might have been of the frozen variety, and there were like 3 of them. Give me my veggies! The chicken itself also wasn't that great and a little dry. It looks a lot like a fast food place so I wasn't really expecting amazing food, but I didn't find the rotisserie is any better than a Swiss Chalet, for example."}
{"text":"Awesome food and my go to lunch place on weekdays. Highly recommend the chicken breast Greek salad with tzatziki and hot sauce. Always flavourful and fresh. The staff are friendly and helpful. I would recommend calling 10 min in advance at lunch time to place your order if you know what you want as it makes it a lot faster then waiting in the long line to order !"}
{"text":"I love this place! The chicken is waaay better than any of the big establishment rotisserie joint and the amount of sides was great, good portion chicken, and I also loved their sauce. I got the half chicken with rice and fries. And the portions are great for the price. Would definitely come back. The staff was friendly and approachable. I want to try the Greek chicken next time I go! Very chill vibe and I appreciate the mom and pop kinda feel vs. big establishment where you pay for the name. Just feels like it's part of the neighbourhood. What brought me here was on their website they claim \"OUR MEATS ARE ALL LOCALLY GROWN AND ARE RAISED HORMONE AND ANTIBIOTIC FREE\" which was probably why it might be priced a bit higher for some, but I thought it was reasonable. All in all would highly recommend!"}
