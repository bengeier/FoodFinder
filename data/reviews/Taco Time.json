{"text":"This place is a real disappointment! Prices are a lot higher than Taco Time elsewhere. Can't believe they are not running any kind of specials! Being it's located at a truck stop, it does not have the greatest atmosphere. We need a regular Taco Time somewhere here."}
{"text":"Love taco time especially the burritos but found at least market mall outlet changed the guacamole to a squeeze bottle and contents thin not thick like guac should be same with sour cream and I loved both on all me mex food.  Its best to go to a sit down restaurant for better quality and more variety.  Taco time used to be a favorite but there cinnamon sugar flakes desert chips are the best!"}
{"text":"This place is so gross and the food is doesn't taste good. The guy took forever to make my food and left a mess on his prep table. If you want microwaved processed food then this is the place for you! I will not go there again."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Food is fine for fast food, kinda pointlessly pricey, the cook there was an asshole and the cashier wasn't much better.  I was the only person they had to help and they made it seem like I was really cutting into their day of leaning on the counter talking."}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with others that while the food is good and fresh, it's the service that sets this Taco Time apart from others. I'm generally a fan of Taco Time anyway and  given the fact that they remember me when I go in there helps me to keep going back.   My wife and I frequent this location, and after our baby was born we didn't go for about a month or two. When we went back they remembered us and were genuinely happy to see us again.  Great customer service and always cheerful."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!   I love it and if you ever go there get the churro it is amazing the only downside is that the taco is always put together bad witch doesn't bother me because I know how to put them together I recommend this taco time and it has won the golden cactus award three years in a row meaning it had been the best for three years but a hard to find location of you don't have GPS!"}
{"text":"I made a mistake of eating at this place. I had 2 hard shell chicken tacos and 1 nacho deluxe. Chicken was bland and very watery. It looks like it just came from the freezer to the table top food warmer. Taco shells were stale and toppings were not fresh at all. Nacho deluxe with beef tasted disgusting. Beans was watered down because when I walked in she was actually adding water in to bean pan thats already cooked. They do this so that it won't dry out and the only time the bean pan will dry out if you have no costumers buying food. The nachos were stale also and placed under a heat lamp that was not working. The meal cost including a small drink was $16 which I thought was very expensive when you're are just going to puke it out after. One thing good about this place is the big screen TV with sports channel. I expect this to go under in 6 months just for the sake of their lease rental agreement."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!  I stopped here to grab a very quick bite to take home while watching the Big Bang Theory (Wicked Show)...and when i got home which was around 5 Minutes away, the Food was cold, the taco was put together very careless and sloppy, the nachos was like poop on chips (now that i think of it sweetcorn! umm) of course the little bird behind the counter was friendly and happy cause it was a take away not eat in! i wonder if they would be the same if you would say \"No eat in, oh and make sure it's bloody hot, and well, the person making them ask them if you could ask them to hold back on the poop and hair\"   DON'T HERE!"}
{"text":"After working a shift in the same plaza, I thought I'd check this place out for a quick bite before heading home. I went in and ordered a beef burrito to go and what I received, I found to be particularly amusing.  This place cooks like someone who had heard about Mexican food. Like someone was explaining a burrito to them and in the middle they said 'Ok, ok, I totally get it. Turn on the open sign'. The burrito I received was about 90% tortilla, with a small smattering of meat and veggies collected at the base.  I gave this place two stars instead of one because technically I did order a burrito and they gave it their best shot."}
{"text":"Terrible experiences spanning multiple occasions.   Having lived in BC for a few years, I was really impressed with the Taco Time locations out there. Enough so that when I learned there was one in Ajax, I decided to mission up there anytime I could.   Well, after four tries, and long drives to get there - I'm done.   This location is absolutely nothing like their BC counterparts. The portions are smaller, the ingredients far less fresh, and there's just something seriously missing in the flavour. Each time I've gone, there has been some kind of error or problem with my order.   The final straw was taking a detour up there while heading home on the 401 west. I ordered a large Super Beef with a large Mexi-Fries Deluxe. My receipt reflected this.   I get home and open the bag to find a tiny, barely-filled burrito that was literally 1/3rd the size and deliciousness of what I'd had in Vancouver, and a regular sized, regular Mexi-Fries. I was the only customer in there, so this wasn't some mix-up.  I hope that this place goes out of business. I'd rather fly back to Vancouver for quality Taco Time than ever go back to this place."}
{"text":"Going to this particular Taco Time was one of the WORST experiences I've ever had concerning fast food. I used to go to Taco Time all the time as a kid back in Oregon. When I found out there was one here I was excited to go and eat there again. My excitement died quite fast though after I got there. It was around 7:00pm and there was only one guy behind the counter. He didn't come to the cash register for a good while, even after seeing me and the other customers waiting. Instead, he yelled for the guy from Burger King to come and work the counter after we had already been waiting a while. Why schedule only one guy in the first place when you know he might need some help? Anyways, the worker from Burger King came over and worked the register. Only, he had trouble doing so. When taking my order he charged me for things I did not ask for. When he printed the receipt I called him on this and he continued by saying 'Oh, I'll fix it'. He took my card back and then supposedly refunded me. Then, after further inspection of the receipt we told him that he forgot to add one of the burritos we ordered. He said 'Oh, I know. But I already told him', referring to the Taco Time employee. How did he tell him and not charge me though? I asked him and he said 'it's all taken care of'. When we finally got our food, took a while since only one guy was there, I checked it. The burrito that the Burger King employee said he told the other was not there. & some of the other items were wrong as well. We ended up going back and telling them. The Taco Time employee corrected the order, sort of, and then we thought everything was fine so we left. But everything was NOT fine. I checked my bank just to be sure and it said that the BK employee had charged me when he tried to refund me and that the TT employee had charged me for something extra too. I was BEYOND annoyed. I filed a complaint with my bank and they fixed the situation to the best of their ability, however they were not able to refund me everything and told me to contact Taco Time. I wasted money there for food that was beyond disgusting as it was made hurriedly and sloppy, and then I was charged extra which I will never get back as I have tried calling Taco Time numerous times only to be sent to voicemail or put on hold. I would advise others to STAY AWAY from this place. There are plenty of other places or fast food joints that are more put together. That way you can get what you pay for and not get charged extra for things you never asked for."}
{"text":"When it comes to Mexican this is as good as it gets. My favorite is the crisp meat burrito. This is well worth the drive regardless of where you're coming from. As competition goes Taco Bell mucho burrito and taco Del Mar don't even come close. Everything is made fresh and has a quality unlike the competition."}
{"text":"Not quite vegan, but I like the veggie burrito w no dairy. Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a quick trip to Bass Pro and ordered a ton of food to take to our hotel. First timer and I like it. We ordered 20 of the meat tacos and several street tacos. The street tacos ain't as good as the taco trucks in Hawaii but it was delicious. The workers here were pleasant. I'd return!"}
{"text":"Checked online to see what time they closed said 10. Got there at 9:20pm and they were closed. I am very disappointed with that. I drove out of the way to get a crisp meat burrito and they were closed on a Friday at 9."}
{"text":"Across from the Metro Grocery Store, and beside Hoops Sports Bar & Grill is Taco Time.   I have to say, it's a pretty run of the mill taco place, similar to Mucho Burrito, but certainly a step up from Taco Bell.  Taco shells, tortillas, chicken or beef, and you can pick your vegetables, sauce, and cheese toppings.  I ordered the Crisp Beef Burrito,  and made a meal of it with their \"Mexi-fries\" and a drink, as well as a dessert of an apple empanada.   The Crisp Beef Burrito was not a real burrito by definition as it did not contain any beans.  Basically it was spiced ground beef in a tortilla and deep fried.  No toppings, no vegetable content.  A little bland for my liking, however had very pleasant textures, especially the fried tortilla, very crispy.   I added some of their medium red hot sauce, but for me it lacked a vinegar/salt flavor.  I appreciate that the hot sauce is likely made in restaurant, and is in a squeeze bottle so that I can add it to anything, in whatever quantity I desire. \"Mexi-fries\" = Tater tots.  Meh.  I just had them plain, but you can have them made Deluxe.  (With sour cream, cheese and salsa, a la fries supreme at Taco Bell.)   The real star was the dessert, the apple empanada, They took apple pie filling  (Likely from a can) and rolled it in the same tortilla as the crisp beef burrito,  and deep fried it.  Then they covered it in a whole mess of cinnamon and sugar.  It was really good, again the texture of the tortilla is light and very crisp.  And quite large actually, the same size as my Beef Burrito.  The service from the couple that likely owns the place was great, they were very gracious, made recommendations,  (\"Try the hot sauce on the fries\", They suggested the  Crisp Beef Burrito as it was the more original item that stood out from the rest of the menu.)  They have a few tables and TV, so you can eat in or take out.   Would I go back?  Sure, if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I LOVE Taco Time!!!! Best deep fried meat burritos and the hot sauce is excellent!!! Only wish there was a location close to me. Open more please!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a Taco Time fan, always have been since I worked there when I was 16 in St.Albert. It's the one restaurant that i worked at that I actually ate at ever again, and one of the reasons was that they have decent quality food and they prep it fresh each day. I also *loathe* Taco Bell.  This is the closest location to my office, so it's the one I usually hit up. 9 out of 10 times it's the same guy and girl working it and they're always very nice, and run a pretty efficient operation. It's also good value for what you get I think.  Taco Tuesdays's features 99 cent tacos all day. I'm a big fan of the Taco salads and the burritos, and of course the Mexi-fries are awesome with some good hot sauce.  This location has a drive-thru too."}
{"text":"What can I say?  It's the closest Taco Time to Dallas so we stop when we're in Vegas.  There is nothing like a Crisp Meat Burrito and Tots!"}
{"text":"After years of living in Southwestern Ontario where there are no TacoTime locations available, it was great to come to one here in Calgary where it remains as good as I remembered.  I ordered both hard and soft tacos and both were excellent, served quickly and had lots filling.  Look forward to coming back again, especially on Tuesdays when they have cheap tacos!"}
{"text":"You may not expect it from your typical fast food restaurant, but this location will pleasantly surprise you. The food is fresh, the restaurant is clean and the service from the employees is fantastic. They are always cheerful, polite and patient.  I only say patient because I observed many patrons order with the typical apprehension when it comes to their turn, even if they had been given plenty of time to order - why do we do that?   The food is prepared as you order so not only is it freshly prepped, but they bring it to your table.  I really like Taco Time, but this is by far the best location I've ever been to set apart from the rest for their exceptionally awesome service."}
{"text":"Got two tacos on soft shells. $6 total. One chicken, one beef.   Beef was good.. but kind of fell apart. Chicken was watery and chewy. Had a weird texture to it.. ugh!   Service was super nice but the food itself was totally underwhelming!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Time, and this location does nothing to change that. Not only is it very clean, but the service is incredibly fast. Much faster than other locations.   Taco Tuesday gives you the opportunity to get crisp shelled or soft shelled tacos for $1.25 each. This is the only thing I can fault them on. I've had bigger (more fillings) and cheaper ($1) tacos on Taco Tuesday at other locations.  I've eaten here a few times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Back when I was in Junior HS out in Edmonton, Alberta I basically had Taco Time about 3 times a week.  I fell in love with the then called \"Crisp meat burrito\" which is now called \"Crisp beef burrito\".  Sadly I can no longer enjoy that burrito since I now have to avoid beef due to gout.  Now in the present, I was surprised to actually stumble across the Taco Time in Ajax.  The menu is vastly different from my days in Jr High.  I ordered Mexi-fries (which are essentially tater-tots), 1 cod fish soft taco and 1 chicken soft taco for my wife, along with a chicken taco salad which we shared.  The cod fish taco was tasty, but messy to eat, wasn't exactly appealing to the eyes at first opening the wrapper.  The soft taco shell itself had gotten stuck to the wax paper wrapper.  This cod fish option was at least much to my taste against the Wendy's Cod fish sandwich which was too salty to my taste buds..  My wife enjoyed the chicken soft taco.  Tho the amount of chicken included in the soft taco could have been more, considering the price paid.  I'd rate the chicken taco salad taste/quality at about 3.5 out of 5.  I did enjoy it to a certain degree, tho it was kind of hard to swallow the $7.99 price point attached to it.    The mexi-fries (large size) which we ordered was poor in regards to price point to portion size.  $3.99 for the large mexi-fries where we could have ordered about 1 large and 1 medium fries no-salt at a Wendy's or McDonalds.  The portion size was too small in my opinion for $3.99.  The medium salsa was available from the counter via a squeeze bottle instead of packets so that is a plus.  There are 4 spice levels now for their sauce vs just Mild and Spicy from back in the day.  Hehe since I can't hold my spice as well any more I just opted for the lowest but still had flavor (enchilada sauce)  This is my first Taco Time meal since 1993 and it hit the wallet for $30.00 bux CAD.  Jeez inflation sux,  Back in the day, 3 hard/soft tacos and mexi-fries would have only been around $5 - $6 bux CAD.    As for a repeat visit, that is still up in the air, not sure as of this writing.  Tho I would venture to say that I prefer it over Taco Bell..tho that probably isn't saying a lot."}
{"text":"This place certainly isnt closed. I was there last night. This place is the best. Yeah I know its fast food \"Mexican\" place but thenfood always tastes freah and the staff are the friendliest around. Calgary is a city known for bad service this place is a standout out exception. Such nice people. Cheap and friendly. Oh yeah tasty."}
{"text":"Yummy crispy burritos! It is like a giant ground beef taquito. I was introduced to these by my BF since he's from Seattle and they have Taco Times everywhere there. I was skeptical at first, but it's good fast food. Since the one in LA closed a few years back this is our closest option. We always buy a bunch when we are leaving Vegas and bring them back home. I wish there was one closer..."}
{"text":"The most disgusting tacos I've had. The tomatoes tasted old! The meat was greasy! I actually threw them away!"}
{"text":"November Challenge - 26/30  Whenever I go to Taco Time and I read their tray liners about how they did all their food research in the heart of Mexico and by hiking in the rainforest, all I can think is, \"gurl, bye.\"   Still, every now and then I get a craving for my favorite thing in the world: a burrito. And sometimes I'm too lazy to make one at home, or I'm at the mall so I can't head over to my go-to: Mucho Burrito.  Taco Time fills this void with their pseudo-Mexi-can't food. When I look at it as simple fast food rather than authentic, I start to see it for what it is: a delicious wrap with fresh veggies, rice and refried beans. A quick filler-upper when I'm marathon shopping. The staff is extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and have no problem veganizing the burritos and tacos for me (the flour and corn tortillas are vegan, according to the website). I also like their sweet potato \"mexi fries\" that I'm sure were imported straight from the heart of Oaxaca. I see Taco Time as Taco Bell with a power-up. And while their hottest hot sauce wouldn't make me sweat, they're still pretty decent to dip the tater tots... er... mexi fries in.  Bonus star because vegan options that aren't a green salad with no dressing for $14, are pretty tricky to come by at the food court. Hi-five, Taco Time :)."}
{"text":"Love super soft burritos from Taco Time, and for a treat went in here to indulge a bit. Long story short...got horrific food poisoning and was out if commission for almost 3 days. Would not wish that experience on my worst enemy! Hope they get their act together and that no one else got sick."}
{"text":"I had to wait for about 5min before the server notice me. I did mind because I notice hr was the only one working. My husband got the supreme soft taco meal. For the price it charge I thought it would be a WAT LOT BIGGER. I got the Casita burrito it was actually pretty good. Though the pictures on the menu look way more satisfying. There wasn't enough lettuce on it. Taco time is like an upscale taco bell. Though I did had a few bloated tummy after I ate it. I think the price is a tad bit expensive. Over all it was better then bugger king next to it. It was something different. And yes most were made by heating it in the microwave."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is great! Good quality tacos for an awesome price. Good tasting hot sauce with a couple of different types to choose. I enjoy their dessert, the cherry or blueberry empanadas. It may Not have taco bells dirt cheap price regularly, but the quality is a huge step up."}
{"text":"My husband raves about taco time!!!! It was great. The only thing is on Google is shows an actual restaurant, but it is in a travel time gas station."}
{"text":"Still loving my Taco Time in the 'hood (Travel Center) for Las Vegas when the need arises (across from the Silverton Casino, off Blue Diamond.) Not a restaurant destination. It can be a scary place, no ambiance with all the truckers, and travelers, but I still like the food. So, if I'm on my own and on that side of town, I'll wander in.   Of late, I've been trying to get away from the Crisp Beef Burrito and have varied it up a bit. I revisited the Soft Meat Burrito -yum- it's the enchilada sauce that makes it so different! Just last week, I had the Casita Burrito (Beef). It was excellent! Next time, I think I'll have that again.   The gal that I see most often (monthly?), knows just how to get my sour cream/ranch so that it's like the Pacific Northwest Taco Time's. She's always smiling, even when she is the only one in the kitchen. Most of the employees I've seen working there are quite nice.   I'm finally over the Mexi Fries, though. ;) I have to save room for the most important stuff."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences we have had. From the service to the food, all terrible and definetely not reccomended. Stale tacos, food sitting out for hours likely and when we expressed our concerns about the food not being fresh, they played the \"racism\" card on us. Unbelievable! Stay away as there are a LOT of better options to eat in the area."}
{"text":"No line up, staff was fine, food was horrible. I am not sure what I was thinking but since moving to Alberta I wondered if this place was any good (not available in Ont). I won't touch Taco Bell but thought this would be a notch above? Not so much. I only needed to order 1 chicken burrito to know I will never order from here again. The wrap was mostly that - wrap and soggy lettuce. Chicken was barely there. The staff saved this review from getting a 1 star plus I am super relieved that I did not get sick."}
{"text":"Had a 2 for 1 coupon for the Super Beef Burrito. Upon getting home with our lovely burritos, imagine our utter dismay when we unwrapped them to discover there was only lettuce and a tiny bit of ground beef in them. Ultimate fail Market Mall Taco Time, ultimate FAIL... Never again."}
{"text":"All right, here's the deal with taco time. The location is crap and the employees are friendly, but it's taco time! You just can't beat the casita burrito! I love these. I used to get them all the time when he used to work there when I was a teenager. I even dream about these. I love them! I will drive all way across town just for this burrito! I love taco time! I don't care what part of town it's in, I don't care who the employees are, I don't even care what the bathrooms look like. I'm going to taco time and eat me some burritos!"}
{"text":"We traveled from Orange County, California, to get to this Taco Time in Las Vegas! Love this place! On our way home, we got there an hour before it opened, but the manager, K. R. Johnson, opened the place up for us, just so my family could have more tacos before we headed back to California. Mr. Johnson was more than cordial, the food was delicious, and we left with such a positive experience. There is just something about Taco Time tacos: they melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Service is always exceptionally nice  :)  They have taco times where i am from in Washington state so i was stoked when i found one in las vegas. The crisp burritos are the bombness! The original hot sauce is so packed with flavor and goes perfect with a crisp burrito or mexi fries aka tots cooked to perfection. Will always stop here when in area."}
{"text":"This place makes the best fried burrito. I got the combo with the pinto bean burrito and the mexi fries (tater tots). My sister had the crispy beef and her husband the tacos which were all excellent. Try it!"}
{"text":"Some places just get it. They understand that customer service is more than just basic service, its the understanding that your patronage is valued.  Taco time at Deerfoot Meadows is just like that. They are alwaus super friendly, efficient and genuinely pleasant.  I was there today and had a veggie burrito combo with salsa chips and a diet coke.  As I watched them make the burrito ( its nice you can see the food being prepared) I thought there is no way I am going to eat all that for lunch. It was really big, packed with rice, beans and all the typical mexican staples, sour cream, lettuce, tomato etc... The girl behind the counter was so pleasant, and accomodating when I asked for a take away bag.   One of the things I like is that unlike taco bell, here you can just pump out your hot sauce into those mini paper cups at the condiment station, rather than the packets  ( which in this day in age is not too earth friendly). The food tastes much fresher and less artificial then at Taco Bell.  The dining room is always very clean and there is lots of parking out front and to the side.  Taco time is consistently delicious and at this location deliciously friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Taco Times - usually, they are pretty good , this one doesn't fall into that category. We ordered something simple 2 bean burritos - we may as well have ordered Peking Duck.  There were only 2 girls working there one in the back ( with an eye patch argh matey!) and the one at the front who was doing the cash as well as making food.  Although there was only one other guest ahead of us,  it seemed to take forever - or in a fast food takeout line about 9 minutes.  It was painful waiting - finally the lady in the back came out to take our order - and my husband said to her \" thanks for coming out\" he meant it legitimately - thanks for coming out from the back - I found if quite hilarious actually as he meant it nicely.  She took our order and the other girl now proceeded to make our food.  I got some sauces - they have 3 kinds of sauces you can choose from and serve yourself which is nice - from a pump - so I put some in little paper cups on my tray. The  girl who made our food - who also did the cash ( not sure how hygenic that was) craned her neck around the corner to call to someone in the food court and her long hair went into the sauce on my tray  - ewwww.... When the burritos were ready ( They are microwaved after assembly ) we ate them and were pretty uninspired - not good.  This location seems really understaffed and the food seemed really poor.  Like many things in the mall   - it was a letdown."}
{"text":"This place is a bit higher priced than taco Bell or del taco, but it's always so good.  The atmosphere isn't the greatest, being inside the Travel America truck stop on the south Las Vegas Blvd, but we like the food so much that it's easy to overlook that one detail in order to enjoy a trip to the one location still in this city.  Sharing the love!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Seattle, Taco Time was a normal stop for me and my family. Since moving to LA, and now living in Vegas, I was only too happy to discover this childhood favorite right here in sin city.   Now whether you are a first timer or a regular here, there are things that you need to know. First of all, there are two different versions of Taco Time. This one here in this review and the original that is abundant in Washington (also known as Taco Time Pacific Northwest). I call any Taco Time outside of the Pacific Northwest an \"Express Taco Time\" because they don't have the complete menu and most importantly, the hot sauce is in packets! In Washington, they make the hot sauce made fresh from scratch!  The good thing is that the main items that they are known for are readily available. My most favorite item is their crisp burritos which come in chicken, pinto bean, and the best of them all, beef. Allow me to describe it. Seasoned ground beef rolled up in a flower tortilla and deep fried to a golden brown. Kinda looks like a large taquito only way better! Damn, my mouth is watering right now just typing this! Get that in a combo with mexi-fries (basically tater tots) and a drink, you're all set! Dipping these items in their hot salsa is the cherry on top! Occasionally I have one of their tacos, soft burritos and taco salads, which is not bad either. Those choices are up to you. To me, the crisp beef burritos have no equal.  I gave them 3 stars because of their location and not so good service. It's in a food court in between Burger King and Subway. The food court itself is smack dab in the middle of a truck stop, which doesn't make it any more appealing. The service is below mediocre because you have one employee that handles everything from taking your order, to cooking, to calling you when it's done.   So if you ever go to Seattle, make Taco Time as a part of your itinerary. For more info, go to their website: www.tacotime.com"}
{"text":"Good god does anyone still eat here? Used to be a cheap place to get a small meal, now it's an expensive place to get a small crappy meal.  Better off to head to Mucho Burrito, Costa Vida, or Tacos Peurto Vallarta(true Mexican!)"}
{"text":"This location used to be good and now one has no idea when they are open.  The open sign is either on by mistake and they are closed during prime time or they revert to drive thru only and by the time one has parked it's too late to turn around and go to the drive thru as MacLeod is a one way."}
{"text":"Dude, I fucking LOVE this place.  I used to go to the one on Decatur/Lake Mead yearsss ago.  They finally put one on my side of town (Summerlin) only for it to close like 6 months later.  I single handedly tried to keep this place open, dammit.  Their stuffed Mexi Fries and Crisp Meat Burritos are the shit and awesome for hangovers.  I almost cried when they closed.  Sad day in Kato Land.  :("}
{"text":"I wish for a day that Taco Time is in Southern California... Please happen."}
{"text":"Service is atrocious. Stood there almost 10 minutes and was never acknowledged. Prices are more than double other locations. Left to eat elsewhere! 2:28 PM 11/15/15."}
{"text":"Taco time!! That is pretty much the only good thing that comes out of this restaurant. It's pretty much just like Pauly D yelling T-SHIRT TIME!! Except that you yell TACO TIME!!!!  Ok. Onto the review. A friend took me here. Took one look at the pictures on the menu and did not like what I saw. The pictures of the food made the food look extremely artificial. Well. Figured I'd give it a shot seeing how I was already here and my friend apparently like it here. Well. I'm not really a big hard taco fan so I opted for the soft beef taco and 2 chicken tacos. I do have to say that the pictures look better than the actual food does. Actually, the pictures make the food look so much fresher than the heap of mangled yellow lettuce and soggy tomatoes looked. One bite was all I lasted before this taco went straight to the garbage.   Next up ... the 2 chicken tacos. Decided I would pick away the lettuce and focus my energy on the actual chicken. Put enough hot sauce on this taco burn my stomach lining out. Only thing is, I don't think my stomach could handle the nasty taste of the food going down.  Ugh. No thank you."}
{"text":"It might not look much but this is a fast food gem! The staffs are the most passionate I've seen in a fast food place! Choose here over the McD across the street! It's quicker, tastier, and the staff actually wants to serve you!"}
{"text":"Had a huge craving for taco time today (aka, I was mega hungover). When you walk in it looks very out dated and old but you can tell the people who run it are very passionate about their business. They were so polite and were working so hard. Extremely nice people and my burrito and tots were delish!"}
{"text":"literally hook a tube up to my mouth and blast the taco time sauce in 24/7. never turn the tap off. keep it running all day and all night. if you turn my tap off i will scream because i need my taco time sauce to keep my motors runnin'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  clean bathrooms, friendly helpful staff, nice ambience"}
{"text":"Kenneth went above and beyond for my guy and I. He deserves a raise! Awesome customer service, unexpected since it's such a sketchy location."}
{"text":"**CLOSED**  What Randy said but I'm giving this an extra star for their 5 tacos for $5 deal. You can choose beef or veggie in the soft or hard taco form. You can mix it up anyway you want. It's cheap eats you might want to slam before a Saturday movie at the AMC Dundas.  I'm not sure what the gimmick is with making the taco in front of you. It's not like, say, Subway or Harvey's where you get some sort of choice. The taco is pretty much just some ground beef, one small part of a tomato, lettuce. Oh wait you get a choice between spicy or mild sauce. Probably should have gone with the spicy. The mild is really mild. Taco Bell's mild sauce still has a little zip to it.  Taco Time can be found in the basement of Atrium on the Bay."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy.  It's located at a truck stop gas station.  I just had to have a Crisp Burrito. I love those things."}
{"text":"They have the worse food ever poor customer service I can't even eat their food and the girl work at the back I never seen her change her gloves.... this place is a piece of sh!t i will never go back to this place again .... I give 1 star just because I can't post my comment if I don't click any of those star ..."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to get my hands on a crispy meat burrito after years without one. I grew up in Portland and during my college days at UO in Eugene, I would often eat those crispy meat burritos for lunch in the EMU. The key is to squirt original taco sauce on every bite. I love their sauce and was so excited to bring a bottle home. I had looked to purchase it online, to no avail. The burritos were not quite as good as I remembered but still quite tasty. The mexi-fries were on point. These are crispy tater tots that I like to dip in taco sauce. This location is in a truck stop/gas station/casino. It's probably better as a to-go option if you have somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"I go here for the Cheese Quesadilla Kid's Meal, which my son likes. I've tried the Beef Burrito combo, and it's okay, but I generally don't have Mexican cuisine as my first choice, and there are plenty of alternatives in the Market Mall food court. Props to the staff for friendliness, though."}
{"text":"It's Taco Time. Yeah, right!.  Just letting you know right now, not my idea to come here.  But it was a co-workers time to pick lunch and he swears by this place. Why you ask? I even wanted to know.  Well, this is the only Taco Time in Las Vegas and he grew up on this stuff back in Utah. Big deal...now let me eat.    Nothing on the menu was appealing to me, both taste wise and calorie wise. I ended up pulling up the myfitnesspal app and found something decent.  I ended up getting their Crisp Chicken Burrito.  I know, their known for their burritos. I just didn't want to indulge knowing that a big dinner was within a few hours.  Their Crisp Chicken Burrito is basically a large deep fried taquito in my opinion.  Tasted okay, but that's about it.   As for the ambiance...yeah right.  This Taco Time is located at a truck stop off Blue Diamond across from from the Silverton Casino/Hotel.  When you're in here, you almost forget you're in Las Vegas.  For a minute, I thought I was in Barstow or even Baker.  Service wasn't the best and they didn't even have forks.  Good gravy...I doubt I will stumble back in here."}
{"text":"Not like taco time nw.....crispy chicken burrito just not the same.....definitely disappointed...will not be making the trip back out here again."}
{"text":"Taco time is a million times better than Taco Bell.  I love their seasoned beef, so yummy!  There mexi fries are bite sized pieces of heaven.  You can pop them in your mouth like popcorn.  The real clincher is their secret sauce.  It is like a slightly spicy salsa that I pour on everything from the tacos to a dipping sauce for my mexi fries.  They need this in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is the best taco time in the city. It is always hot and fresh! The staff are polite and get my order right every time. I haven't had fast food this good in years. Every time I come here it's great. It reminds me of when I first had taco time as a child. I would drive across town to go to this taco time over any other."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Taco Time, you are making me feel nostalgic (and slightly bloated). It's Taco Bell quality, with some nice unique items, most notably the crisp burritos. It was fairly cheap, and I got exactly what I wanted. Do yourself a favor: let your crisp burrito sit a bit, they come out of the fryer very hot."}
{"text":"Never was a fan of Taco Time, now I remember why. Bland, flat, flavourless, yuck. So bland that adding their version of salsa verde actually killed the taste of the salsa, wow!  The strongest flavour in my bean burrito was the lettuce; that is just fricken sad. The only reason this is a two star review instead of one is the service was friendly, and I like that there are different sauce options which come in containers. That's a slight step up from the hotter versions of the same runny red salsa in packets à la Taco Bell.  This will be my last foray to any Taco Time, ever."}
{"text":"Yup! What can I say, I just love their original hot sauce! ..... sooooo good! :) haha  I like this one cuz its' on my way home and there is a drive-thru.   Taco Tues $0.99/tacos M-F after 5pm: 5 tacos for $5."}
{"text":"My \"bro\"(after taco time I question if he's my bro, hence the \"bro\") Baltazar was begging us to go to taco time and said they were the best tacos in the world. He's from Montana and grew up on this stuff. Because Montana is well know for good Mexican food right. We land in Vegas and he drags us out to the middle of the desert. Our uber driver took us on a mission around the desert to get there. Meanwhile my friend and I are thinking man these better be the best damn tacos we ever had. We get there and it's some beat up old truck stop in the middle of nowhere. Look at the menu and I couldn't believe that a meal only comes with one taco, what the hell am I supposed to do with one taco. And the \"mexi-fries\" are just dam tater tots. I'm Mexican and had no idea tater tots were Mexican-news to me. So I order the taco meal with \"mexi-fries\" and an extra taco. We waited like 30 minutes for anyone's order to come out. When our order was ready the guy said tacos, \"who ordered tacos?\" My friends and I and other customers just stare at each other, like this is a taco place everyone ordered tacos. So we are like is this order 518, they guy was dumbfounded and said \"two tacos?\" I'm like yes we all ordered tacos is it #518, he looks at the screen 3 times. I'm just like I'm taking these damn tacos I'm starving. Sit back down and I have no ketchup for my tater tots so I go ask for some, took them 10 minutes to acknowledge me, by the time I go sit down my food is cold. Open up my taco expecting to eat the best taco I've ever had in my life. Jesus Christ it tasted like nothing and my taco crumbled in my hands. The tater tots tasted like tater tots, um okay. Vegas has the best food in the world and this guy takes us to taco time. 2 hours later we all had the squirts on our bro weekend in Vegas. From then on we do not let Baltazar pick any more food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and had mixed feelings about it.  The staff was ridiculously slow to prepare our food the first time we went and they got my order wrong. I paid extra for \"mexi fries\" with the works on it and they only gave me reguar ones - this is one of my biggest pet peeves seeing as how your PRIMARY job is to prepare my order and do it right. It was okay food, about par with taco bell.  However, I went back recently on a weekend when I was working and not much else was open and got great service. I had their taco chicken salad and was really impressed and I've been back and ordered it again since. First, the salad was huuuuuge. And they put some mixture of onions and tomatoes or something else with yummy mexican spices onto the salad and that made it for me. The taco shell was nicely cooked and the chicken was tender and well spiced. I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than lunch on a workday (not worth going out of your way for) but if you're in the area and you don't want subway, its an okay option."}
{"text":"Really miss Taco Time since they left Hawaii years and years ago.  The crispy burrito is still da bomb but costs over $3 a piece now.  Taco time still offers tater tots (calling them \"Mexi Fries\"), which I love later in the day as well as at breakfast time.  Nachos only ok - bigger than Taco Bell varieties but not really any tastier.  Self-serve, refillable soda fountain here so you can fill your cup up before venturing on to the Strip (or driving off to CA, whichever the case might be)."}
{"text":"\"I'm so bad, punish me, make me feel you from the inside out\", my internal monologue as I stare down the 8\" cylinder.   Yes fellow yelper foodies, don't lie to me.  Be it McD, Jack, the King, you've all eaten it and you all secretly crave it.  You know, \"food\" manufactured from 20 different chemicals, called natural because human hands made them in a lab.  Genetically modified animal and plant life perfectly altered to meet formulation requirements.  Some, \"deep fried\" in a chemically modified oil, others subjected to radiation.  YUM!  \"It's a difference you can taste\" (their slogan, not mine).  So true!  Crisp MEAT Burrito - I promise that's what it's called.  One bite of the crispy, preservative laden flour-ish tortilla sends molten cheeze and taste bud altering, texturally appealing protein amalgam oozing into your mouth!  Be sure to add the \"fresh\" original salsa to every bite.  Straight from the little packet.  Heaven!  Don't forget the side of Mexi-Fries [tm], AKA tater tots.  Crispy on the outside, oily on the inside, outstanding lubrication for later.   Want a good laugh, check out their website while consuming.  You thought BK was bad.  So remember, \"any time is Taco Time\"!  Note:  This location is at a truck stop with other similar alternatives for your serious foodie friends."}
{"text":"Very clean in fact it's the cleanest fast food restaurant I have ever been in that management seems to live by the saying you have time to lean you have time to clean and even the bathroom was clean I live taco time food and this one was spot on"}
{"text":"I went to the location in Ajax, Ontario within the Somerset plaza. The service was good, the food was decent. I had the chicken burrito and the beef hard shell taco. It's a great place to come for a quick bite and or a drink since they have a LLBO. 100% better than Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Best fast food tacos from my hometown, Seattle...  their crispy burritos are so good, tacos are 10x Taco Bell or Del Taco, and pretty much everything on the menu is amazing.  They have the best hot sauce ever and they'll give you as much as you want.  Keep it in your fridge cause its great on anything from eggs to potatoes, soup, or marinades.  Taco Time rules!!!"}
{"text":"This is taco time, but not the cleanest most inviting one I've ever been to. Poor guy behind the counter was taking orders and making everyone's food. It was a slower stop than we had anticipated and slightly disappointing with the cleanliness of the facility. But you'll still get your standard taco time fare so that's worth two stars."}
{"text":"I just moved to Ajax and found Taco Time while driving around the local neighbourhood.  I enjoy it much more than the place with the talking chihuahua.  I've never seen a drop of grease dripping from the tacos.  The quality of their food and freshness of the ingredients really make it stand out.  The owners are very friendly and obviously very hard working.  I highly recommend Taco Time as a better and healthier alternative to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"#3!!!!  Unfortuneatley, this is not a real Taco Time. It has the logo, but it's not the same as the ones in Seattle.  Soft Taco doesn't even come with ranch.  Mexi-fries we got were like the leftover scraps of real mexi-fries.  Awful."}
{"text":"The only Taco Time in Nevada (that I know of) and it's in the creepiest, grossest Truck stop I've ever seen... granted I've only seen the one truck stop.   That said, Crisp Meat Burrito FTMFW!!!"}
{"text":"Think Taco Bell with a different name, and you're pretty much there. Unlike Taco Bell, they actually prepare stuff in front of you - but the taste is about the same, quality is similarly low, and there's still that damned sour cream caulking gun.  As with Taco Bell, though: Dr. Pepper from a fountain. Mmmmm....  I don't think I'd come back if given the opportunity - Chipotle is much tastier and just a few minutes away walking."}
{"text":"Love their Beef Burrito with avocado on a whole wheat wrap!  Delicious, especially with loads of hot sauce.  Yum!  Avacado is extra.    I always end up eating the same thing.  I was so happy when they brought in whole wheat wraps!!"}
{"text":"You're giving a Pseudo-Mexican fast food joint FOUR STARS??  Are you nuts ?  Well, I'm actually giving them 3.5 stars but there's no option for a half-star.  People always ask me that same question every time I drag them alllll the way out to Blue Diamond just for the Crisp Rolled Burritos when there's a Taco Bell just down the street from me.  The grub at this spot really is THAT good though (for deep-fried fast food)  Their 1/4lb crisp tacos are just way better than Taco Bell or Del Taco in my opinion, but my true favorites are the rolled crisp chicken burritos.   Imagine chicken in Alfredo sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla and deep fried until the tortilla is crispy and flaky, but the chicken is not all dried out (Mind you, it's not really Alfredo Sauce, I think, but it's just what the sauce reminds me of).  It's really hard to explain but it's just such good grub!  The only reason it doesn't get a full 4 stars from me if the fact that it's in a grubby travel station that reeks of smoke and travel station funk, so I could never enjoy my meal in comfort fresh out the fryer and always end up eating it on the road."}
{"text":"This location is in a truck stop, yes! Tackie?! You say... please remember those 18 wheeler trucks keep the working world a float.  From the stinky live stock, to scent of freshly cut wood and flurries, grindings flying through the air. This isn't the place to bash us truckers. Stick to the resturant review.  Personally, I used to run 10 miles daily, and getting into this line of work isn't easy. From the horrible bumper huggers, yeah! You! PASsenger vehicles that think 4 foot travelling distance is logical or even advised in your drivers manual.  Anyway!  The tater tots are awesome; better then any other resterant out there. Yeah I said it!   I had a veggie burrito, Delicious!   To bad this place isn't at every truck stop."}
{"text":"Taco Time is kind of out of the way for most people. In fact the location being inside a truck stop kinda ruins its availability and attractiveness to the stable patron of a fast food restaurant, the family.  My GF loves this franchise and explains every time we drive by how she grew up eating at one on the west coast.  We stopped by a few months ago and the food and service was your typical fast food Mexican fare. Nothing there stood out as great and would cause me to desire or crave the dish I had.  Last night the GF begged me to bring her a veggie burrito. I parked and went inside and was surprised to see how many smelly truckers there were. Had to be two or three truckers for every truck outside.  Service was fairly quick my GF couldn't find the sunflower seeds in her veggie burrito but it didn't stop her from wolfing it down.  I won't be coming here on my own (more Taco Johns than Taco Bell and I do live across from a taco shop and can walk there) I will be happy to drive down here the next time the GF gets the craving for home/childhood."}
{"text":"Taco Time is not cheap or fast enough to be considered a quick lunch location.  Taco Time is not expensive or impressive enough to be considered a real restaurant.  Food court quality of meals and service. Crumpled little parking - though there are huge parking lots around.  If you still feel like getting those taco, don't lose your time - call them in advance, drive by, get your stuff, go back to the office.  Can't imagine any other use of Taco Time, sorry..."}
{"text":"I don't often eat fast food but we decided to this time...came out of Ikea where the food line was a mile long..  We ordered a refritos burrito...twice the guy asked us if we wanted beans?? I said refrito means bean does it not?? DUH  Then I watched two people prepare the burritos...each one had plastic gloves on. Each one touched the counter, the microwave, every surface and who knows what they touched before making my order. For F's sake teach your staff food handling!!! The plastic gloves are not for the staff's safety but to stop bacteria from touching the food they are preparing..  Once they were finished they microwaved it....It was luke warm at best.  Last time I will go into a taco time...  The large was $7.50ish...I can get a gorgeous custom burrito at Mucho Burrito's for about the same price....  This type of fast food place will not last....."}
