{"text":"The Bahn Mi here is better than Superior Pho...but that is probably about it.  The marinated and grilled pork is soooooo flavorful!   I have ordered Pad Thai twice here and the first time is was good and saucy and the second time...half of it was dry noodles.  It is a very cute place.  I also like the little altar and incense in the doorway, I feel like I am entering a temple or a special place."}
{"text":"I've been to many pho restaurants and I'd have to say that this place was a huge disappointment. My first visit wasn't too bad and I found myself wanting to go back. The Banh Mi was only $2.95 and though it wasn't the best vietnamese sandwich I've had, it was decent for the price. The pho portions were smaller and more expensive compared to Superior Pho Restaurant across the street and the soup just wasn't as tasty. If you know pho, then you'd know how important the soup is.   After going there for the second time, I've decided that I won't be making any more visits to this place. The service is lacking a bit, in that the waiters and waitresses don't even bother asking how the food is. Also, we were disappointed to find some unwanted things in the soup. Maybe it's because this is a new restaurant, but it's important for the owners to maintain some quality control. The inconsistencies in the flavor of the soup was more than enough for me to say bye bye to this place."}
{"text":"One word: Horrible.    I ordered the spring rolls. One bite into it, I gagged. Instead of placing the mint leaves in the rolls, they had the entire stem and all; they neglected to put the roots in. Why don't ya throw in some dirt too.   Had I choked, I could have quit my day job AND night job---just kidding; I'm unemployed"}
{"text":"My friend turned me onto Saigon, what a great lunch spot! Their noodle dishes are full of fresh ingredients, served by a friendly staff. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and the portion sizes.   The decor is simple but tasteful. I would definitely recommend for a business lunch or casual get together."}
{"text":"Best vermicelli dishes in Cleveland at the moment. Not so much the Pho, there really isn't a proper place for that yet, atleast you get more mint herb than all other places in Cleveland And they have Che bay mau, i think if this sticks around it'll improve the more people go."}
{"text":"The food was good.   The Service was absolutely horrible.  I would go elsewhere.  We went in with one Chinese guy, 2 white kids, and 1 mixed race person.  The other customers were Vietnamese.  They got refils, service and more.  There are other very good Pho places without the outdated attitude."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Highly recommend A101 (fried shrimp rolls) and C59 (jasmine rice and pork chop)"}
{"text":"Classic Vietnamese flavors at a great price.  My wife and I had the spring rolls, ground pork rolls, bun thit nuong, and shrimp fried rice.  All were excellent and generously sized.  The fried rice was especially good, as it wasn't greasy and actually had a lightness to it that is rare for fried rice.  Friendly, attentive service, and the food came out remarkably fast, which was perfect since we had to head to the theatre.    We plan on returning, and I'll add a fifth star if the quality of some of the other dishes is as good as what we had tonight."}
{"text":"Small portion sizes, inconsistent food (ordered the same thing but got it completely different), expensive but poor quality (compared to #1 Pho).  Most of all: We ordered take-out and it was fine, expensive, but we were still a bit hungry. A week later we decided to go eat there. First of all, they charged $.50/cup of tea when we both ordered it, but gave us a kettle. We were charged to use their cups? Then when we got a refill, they charged us another $1 for the kettle, which was just the same tea ball with more water so the tea was watered down and had no taste the second time. The food was fine, the broken rice is ok and the vermicelli is dry, but more like a salad. The beef dishes are mostly fat with very little lean meat.  Here's the kicker: This is a new business and they decided to start it out by stealing from their new customers. My receipt was altered by the waiter (or someone) and I was overcharged by $10. (classic adding 1 before the tip amount!). I contacted the restaurant and was hung up on. Now I have to dispute the amount with my bank and report this place to the police. If you go here, pay with cash! Don't use credit or debit cards!   Overall: Don't waste your time. It's overpriced and not good quality. They stole from me, plus charged for water and cups! Go to #1 Pho, which is superior quality and literally a few steps away. This place will go out of business very soon.   Edit: The bank required me to file a police report against the restaurant in order to reverse the charge. The police informed me that they are investigating similar claims against the owners for forgery and credit card alteration fraud."}
{"text":"Saigon Grille is as good as Superior Pho in taste but their portions are smaller than Superior Pho. The restaurant itself is a lot nicer than Superior Pho."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to the many Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland.   To reviewers to say that they can't make pho, Ok, I know it's a Vietnamese staple, but this place isn't called BEST PHO KING BOWL, it's called Saigon Grille. Eat the grilled food, it's delicious. I went here last year with my brother and my father (we're all Vietnamese) and we all loved this place.   Banh mi thit nuong (grilled pork) is quite possible the best banh mi that I've ever had. Worlds better than Banh me & Che Cali or Lee's Sandwiches in California. Freshly grilled taste, not just meat sitting around. But everything that has the thit nuong (rice paper rolls, bun, com tam) is amazing.   I haven't tried any of the soup dishes yet, I'm still stuck on the grilled meats.   Their cafe sua da (Iced coffee with condensed milk) is also really tasty.   Food aside, the service seems to be getting better. It was taking way too long for them to get food out at lunch time but it's much faster than it was."}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is that the manager is rude. We parked in front of the restaurant (in a clearly marked parking zone) and the manager came out and started screaming at us that we were parked in front of his driveway! We clearly showed him there was no driveway and that it was a sidewalk. He said he was going to call a tow truck on us for absolutely no reason. If you don't want people to park in front of your restaurant, find a way to put up a no parking sign. Don't yell at your customers.  I ended up moving my car and my business and ate down the street at Pho #1. I'm glad I did because some of these reviews clearly show this place SUCKS."}
{"text":"Coming from California, it has been quite a challenge to find good Vietnamese food. Being a vegetarian is even harder. I had a veggie pho and it was straight up hot water with tons of salt! It was horrible. My friend had the meat BBH and she complained it being super salty as well. We had the 3 color dessert and it was so-so. I don't know if we both got the bad dishes or not, but for sure I'm not going to give it another try."}
{"text":"After craving Pho we headed to Superior Pho as our usual place. But sadly, being labor day, it was closed. So...we saw the sign for Saigon Grille and \"Pho\" and figured, eh...why not.   I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. Firstly, I enjoyed the ambiance they have created in the restaurant and the wait staff are all very friendly. Their menu was much more extensive than I expected.  We tired the pho and a vermicelli dish and I must give both a solid A. The food was fresh, the noodles were well cooked, the meat was plentiful and the broth of the pho was delish. Plus the prices were very affordable.  I would certainly go back here!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Vietnamese place. Their pho is awesome and their chicken cabbage salad is pretty good too. But the best is their Bahn Mi. They put the marinated grilled pork chop into their sandwich instead the traditional Vietnamese meats. It makes it the best Bahn Mi in town!"}
{"text":"By far THE best Pho in Cleveland. I recently moved here and have now tried ALL the vietnamese restaurants. Saigon Grille is the ONLY restaurant which produced a Pho with a dark, fragrant broth instead of a light sweet one. The meat was perfect, it was thinly sliced, still pink when it came out, and melted in the mouth. The noodles were also cooked to perfection.   I was so impressed with the Pho that I have had to go back a couple of times, to make sure that I didn't get a fluke, but each time it has been awesome.   The Bahn mi pork was absolutely delicious, the pork was crying with charcoal grill-ness.  My husband has tried two Bun dishes and has been extremely happy with them too.  The staff have been super friendly and more than willing to answer any questions.  The only thing I have not liked so far were the crispy shrimp and calamari appetizers. There were not very well seasoned and therefore only tasted of batter and oil. They were cooked well but need to be seasoned."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have a quick lunch that was near my job...didn't really have enough time to really explore the place but it was okay.  Later I will give a better review when I have a sit down lunch lol.  I ordered the Goi Cuon...it had lettuce but I kind of thought it would go better with cabbage...just my two cents lol.  Oh and I didn't have to wait long for my food...maybe like five minutes."}
{"text":"Came into town and tried this place since it just opened.  First impression the decor was nice and the restaurant was clean (well it's new so it better be).  The menu has your standard Pho selections and Broken Rice, which I don't recall seeing at other Vietnamese establishments.  I tried the Broken Rice which came w/ pork chops, meat loaf, shredded pork, fried egg, side salad, and rice.  The presentation looked great and everything tasted good.  Now why the 2 stars?  The others in my party had a bad experience w/ the Pho.  The portions were small relative to others Pho restaurants.  When you order a Pho you expect a decent amount of food.  Also, one of the Phos that was ordered had to be sent back.  Let's just say an unsuspecting insect had flown into the soup.  Not good."}
{"text":"NO! Don't eat here. Srircha didn't even taste right."}
{"text":"The market for pho and bahn mi is quickly becoming a hot bed of activity out in the Asiatown area in Cleveland near eastside.  With the addition of Saigon Grille to the other wonderful offerings we Clevelanders have we should consider ourselves lucky to have now a fourth option within a city block radius.  So far it has been difficult for anyone to match the quality of Superior Pho, but Saigon Grille has done a damn fine job of coming close.  The broth of the pho was VERY flavorful and vibrant.  The round eye and tripe were very good, and not chewy.  For me a good sign that pho is done right is when after it cools you see the little fat globs beginning to form.    I had ordered the bahn mi almost as an afterthought, and after having taken a bite of this amazing sandwich I quickly realized that it took center stage.  The grilled pork was second to nobody's bahn mi in the CLE area.  I do wish it had some pate, or at least more of it but aside from that it was fantastic.  All in all, Saigon Grille has gotten it right.  There may have been some hiccups during the first few weeks after open - and what restaurant doesn't have them - but they have seemed to iron them out.  As I was walking out of the establishment it dawned on me that Siagon Grille can be summed up as follows:  it's a nice interior like #1 Pho, but with food that is about as good as Superior Pho."}
{"text":"I had an average experience here at Saigon Grille.   Food: had bun (vermicelli noodles) with grilled shrimp. I have to say that they grilled it with a great char and that was pretty tasty, but the rest of the dish was pretty average. Very light meal with average portions and prices.  Service: The service was a little inattentive... there were only 2 parties in the restaurant at the time and I thought we could have been offered some better service.  Decor: it's fairly nice inside! I'd have to say it's an enjoyable experience--not as hole in the wall as some of the other Cleveland places around here.  I'm not entirely convinced that I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"4 star because I would go back to give their food another try. But just for the one time experience, I'd give it only a 3.5 star. We went there for dinner, and got a summer roll for appetizer. The roll was served at room temperature, which wasn't all that good. They should really chill the ingredients before serving it. For entree, we got a lemongrass chicken rice dish and a spicy beef noodle soup. The chicken was actually unbelievably tender! And the noodle soup came out with a lot of raw veggies, just like pho. Soup was tasty, but the noodle was so so. Got a vietnamense coffee...it came in the SMALLEST cup you can imagine with the MOST amount of ice possible. That's definitely a sign to never order their drinks again. But we'd go back for the food, just to try a different dish next time."}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming here Friday nights when Superior Pho is closed. Just kididng, I love coming here anyways! They have great pork+spring roll vermicelli and banh mi! I also love to get their jackfruit bubble tea. The servers are also very attentive, so I definitely recommend giving this place a try! :)"}
{"text":"THERE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! My family and I went to Saigon Grille for a late lunch (around 1:30). They told us to sit anywhere in the area they pointed so we sat down and they gave us menus. After about 10 minutes, no on came to our table so we had to call a waiter over. We got our food and were just talking and eating. My mom asked for a glass of hot water and lemon, and they never gave it to us. I asked the waiter 3 times and they still ignored our request and never gave the water until I went up and literally demanded it. I know that there is no language barrier because our waitress was speaking english to the customers a few tables down from us. Throughout our meal, the waitress would go over to the customers a few tables down and periodically ask how there meal was, and asked if they needed anything else. The same waitress never came up to us and asked any of that to us. ALSO, she never gave us our check, blatantly ignored us and was a total bitch to our face. Even though there food is good, i would NEVER go back to a resturaunt with such HORRIBLE service! Totally ruined my families mood for the rest of the day. No customer should deserved to be out right ignored by the workers."}
{"text":"Awww, I heart Saigon Grille. It's super adorable inside.   The staff is outrageously friendly and efficient. But I passionately dislike being called ma'am (unless it's by a boy that I'm ordering around).     Okay haters, don't shoot me but ...... Saigon Grille's bahn mi is *possibly* better than Superior Pho's! But don't worry -- their pho isn't better. So we can still be VietPhoSnobs and say, \"Like Omigod! Superior's is like wayyyyy more authenic 'n stuff cuz I've like totally been to Vietnam like 10x!\"   Back to their pho. I liked it okay but the broth seemed to lack meaty flavor and had a bit too much cinnamon. Simply put, it was too sweet. And their noodles seemed to be a bit thinner than normal. I'd like to try some of the broken rice dishes next time.   Some of the other reviews state that their portions are small. Hmmm, my portions were not small. The bahn mi was actually a bit larger than others in the area and the regular sized pho was plenty big -- enough for two large, overflowing bowls at home.   Glad to see more restaurants popping up in Cleveland's Asia Town."}
{"text":"I love Saigon Grille. Seriously. For the price, you'd be hard-pressed to find better. This is a regular lunch spot for myself and coworkers. It is fast, friendly service, easily in and out in under an hour. My go-to-dish is the bún tht nng (rice vermicelli with pork), but I also like the spring rolls, clay pot dishes, pho and the broken rice dishes.  I frequently go hear with a friend who is notoriously picky and is always asking for a menu item to be modified. They are polite with her and always quick to fulfill requests.  Good vegetarian selection as well.  The restaurant itself is clean and calm. It's usually bustling, but rarely are you kept waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Went here with my family after being curious that this place opened next to two other Pho places. The decor is very nice. Hardwood floors, leather seats, very clean. They really fixed up the place! They also have a patio out but it's unfinished. That wouldve been nice if it was fixed up.   There were four of us. We ordered their vermicelli with pork and shrimp, beef noodle soup with meatballs and got some drinks: Thai iced tea and tri-color dessert.   First of all, the meat is cooked perfectly but their noodle soup is a bit different compared to other places. The broth is lighter and  there is hardly any taste of the beef. It's definitely healthier but for me, I liked the actual taste of the authentic beef broth.   Their \"Thai iced tea\" is NOT Thai iced tea. It tastes just like the Asian black jelly drink with loads of sugar. The ones you buy in the cans at the market. Last time i had Thai iced tea, the color was orange, not dark red. Their tri-color dessert was on the other hand delicious. It had the right amount of coconut milk, red beans, and tri-color jellies.   Overall the prices are kind of the same everywhere. The regular size for both were about $6-7. The service was fine and it's a great place to bring a date. They had a TV but no music playing in the background. They did however had small children there which I found a bit odd since it's a place of business not a playground.   The only thing that stood out to me is that they have banh mi so I may come back to try that."}
{"text":"There are several Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance, in my opinion this is the best. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and it was excellent. The stock was delicious and the meat was tender and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend you try this place if you're ever in the area. Great find!"}
{"text":"Watch out Superior, you have competition in the Bahn Mi department!  I had a relentless craving for a Bahn Mi. After learning that Superior Pho is closed on Mondays, I headed next door to Saigon Grille for I knew #1 Pho doesn't have them.   Less than $3 for a Bahn Mi?!  It HAS to be bad, I thought.   I was pleasantly surprised! The roll was fresh and crusty, the grilled marinated pork was super tasty and the jalapeno, cucumber and pickled veggies gave it kick. It's right up there with Superior's sandwich.  I also had the Shrimp Rice Paper rolls. They were good and tasted as they should. They were a bit on the small side though.   My only real complaint was the **Thai Tea that I got to go. It contained so much ice, I only got about 5 good sips. Very little tea and pearls. Lots of ice. Bah!   The service was fine and not slow as others have noted. Although, it was an off time. It was pretty empty.  I will definitely hit this place up for a Bahn Mi again.  **Please note that the Thai Tea is Boba or \"Bubble\" tea. It doesn't say so on the menu. It just says Thai Tea."}
{"text":"Stick to the grilled foods and keep it simple when you die at Saigon Grille.    Saigon Grille was an average experience for me.  The service was ok, not bad but not great.  The food was ok, but not great.  Actually, \"ok, but not great\" was really the theme of the expeirence.  We had the Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe), Canh Ga Chien B (Butter Fried Chicken Wings 4pc.), Crispy Pork Skin Rolls (it was a rice paper roll), Pho Tai Sach (Pho with eye round steak and tripe), and Bun Thit Nuong cha gio (Vermicelli rice noodles with marinated grilled pork and chopped egg rolls).  The thit nuong cha gio was good.  The grill flavor made the dish pop.  It's fairly simple dish and we did spice it up a lot with the red pepper paste, but I was quite happy with this one and I would eat it again.  The flavors were clean and simple and I wanted to keep stealing bites from my wife.  Even so, compared to the food I've had at other Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland, this was average at best.    The pho was actually pretty good, but they didn't hit it out of the park.  The broth was full of flavor and quite lively.  The beef didn't do me wrong and the tripe was actually quite tender given it's tripe.  There was plenty of meat in the bowl, but I would have liked a bit more tripe.  I would say their pho is better than most places in Cleveland, but I wouldn't deem it to be a great success. #1 Pho is still my favorite, but I would eat Saigon Grille's pho again.  The other items (the appetizers) were nothing special, and in some cases complete failures.  The wings were super crispy, which I really liked, but I would have loved to get something more than sweet chili sauce to dip them in.  These were plain wings, after all.  I would probably skip these next time.  The crispy pork skin rolls lost their crisp--it tasted like they made the wraps earlier in the day.  The refrigeration and moisture from the noodles got rid of the most important texture of the food--the crisp.  The crispy pork skin rolls were also quite flavorless.  I could have done without the rolls.     The banh xeo  was an oily mess.  It  was not a traditional banh xeo/Vietnamese crepe. I would say this was more like a thick Chinese pancake wrapped around canned shrimp and some cooked beef, then doused in oil.  The oil was so heavy that all I could really taste was the oil--the flavors of the ingredients or any seasoning they might have used were completely lost.  I think I could taste the green onion, but that was it.  Since the item was super thick and messy, it just didn't work.  I wish I hadn't ordered it.  Our server was attentive to start, but she was confused on our orders even when we ordered by the menu numbers.  My wife asked to have her dish made spicy and the sever just told us to add some of the sriracha and red pepper paste on the table to our food.  I'm sure they have something in the kitchen to make the food spicy for us, but that's not a huge deal and we made it work.  I was kind of irked when I had to go to the server to give her our payment--she didn't come back after she paid the bill even though this wasn't one of those joints where you pay at the register near the exit."}
{"text":"Rocky vs. Apollo.  Coke vs. Pepsi.  Pat's Vs. Geno's.  Amy Winehouse vs. sobriety.  and now... Superior Pho vs. #1 Pho vs... Saigon Grille?!?  who woulda ever thunk it-- the battle lines for Cleveland Pho supremacy are being drawn along an 8 block radius on Superior Ave.  and for you out-of-towners-- it's serious.  everyone's got their fave pho place, and if you disrespect it, you disrespect yo'self, if you know what i'm sayin'.  so what kinda nerve does Saigon Grille have as a young upstart entering into this \"pho-ray\"?  i saw the \"GRAND OPENING\" sign, and my whip screetched to a halt.  i had to check dis out.  it advertises Vietnamese and Thai cuisine, but the menu is decidedly Vietnamese.  that said, i was impressed by the depth of the choices.  their four pager had more variations of the pho and broken rice fare than the competition.  also, they do have a nice beverage selection that also distinguishes from its bretheren;  i had the Mung Bean shake which was a nice treat!  i went for the pho.  the portions were standard, and the food was definitely fresh.  they were not stingy with the meat, and the bean sprouts/basil were crisp and clean.  i shot a few quick glances at my neighbors, and noticed that their rice dishes looked quite appealing too.  service was friendly and great.  some of the wait staff may not be fluent in English, but their attitudes are so friendly, so it's not a problem at all.  ambience is great-- you can carry a conversation here.  in short-- Saigon Grille is a great entry into the already crowded Cleveland pho scene that will definitely pull away some of the Superior and #1 Pho faithful.  which one's my favorite of the three?  are you kidding me??  to quote Ice Cube-- \"check yo' self befo' you wreck yo'self.\""}
{"text":"Finally I ate at Saigon Grill which is right next to Superior Pho.  Sorry for a comparison but I cannot help comparing these two restaurants for my review.  Saigon Grill is little bit more upscale than Superior Pho. a bit. It is clearner and tables and seates are a bit more luxurious. a bit.  The waitress here are super friendly, smiley and welcoming! It is the opposite of McDonald's/Rally's staff.   (Banh Mi) OMG. Very very good here. The grilled pork is amazing. it is only $3.75. We also order one for take away.   (Vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp) I knew this one would be a killer and I was right! Wow, the pork was well marinaded and very yum. This is the same pork in the Banh Mi.   (Egg Noodle)  The soup for egg noodle is dirtier and more intense than Pho. The noodle in this dish was not a highlight tho, the soup was very tasty.  (Fried Rice with Shrimp and Vietnamese sausage) I've never had friend rice in Vietnamese style and I was totally imagining something like Thai Fried Rice which is my favorite fried rice but it wasn't. It's got all frozen diced peas,carrots and tiny shrimps, and green onions and this very sweet vietnamese style sausage, and it was seasoned with salt and pepper only. I could make it! Maybe I didn't order a right dish for me.  I will go back there to try their Pho and other stuff especially their pork dish are superb!"}
{"text":"Years ago and hundreds of miles away I first encountered Vietnamese food. Concentrated along Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia I could find cream cakes, drip coffee in condensed milk, huge bowls of pho, and a wide range of street food. My first love was what was called Saigon stew. It was a perfect example of slapping sleepy French beef burgundy stew to life. Since then I discovered the Vietnamese make beef stew or bo kho many ways. Usually far more like a soup than my first sampling. Sometimes served over egg or rice noodles or with bread.   The previous owners of Number One Pho made an excellent stew served with egg noodles. Now I find the stew at Number One Pho greasy, gristly, and far more red liquid than beef. Superior Pho does not have it on the menu but they do serve the only pho I need.   Recently I tried Saigon Grill's beef stew with noodles. Oh my. If it had just a bit more beef I would stop my search and say I found my one and only. As of now I prefer the bo kho at Mi Li's in Columbus.   I have had the pork banh mi and the beef salad at Saigon Grill which I also found extremely good. I intend to eat my way down this menu dish by dish."}
{"text":"The number of Vietnamese and Pho options in Cleveland has expanded in recent years.  One of the newer options is Saigon Grille, which is within a block of two other well established Pho restaurants.  I am giving Saigon Grille 4 stars on the strength of the Grilled Pork Bahn Mi Sandwich - the smokey sweet and spicy sandwich is very good and my favorite in the area.  The Pho is ok -- it is not the best but it is ok.  They can do a better job of skimming the oil and fat off of the pho broth which is my only minor complaint.  Our party enjoyed the Grille Pork Bahn Mi, Beef Pho, Chicken Pho, and Grilled Pork with egg and Broken Rice.  Everything tasted good and again, the sandwich was great.  Saigon Grille and the Nail Supply store next to them share a rear parking lot.  Access is off of E. 31st (one way street from Superior) and it is like a small alley called Danford Ct.  There is a small white sign with red letters and arrow to point the way.  For anyone new to Pho, here is my generic description taken from one of my other reviews: \"It comes with your choice of meats along with rice noodles and some lighter herbs in a savory broth. A plate of bean sprouts, Asian basil, mint, pepper and lime is brought out on a plate. You can eat the noodle soup plain, and I recommend you do that for a bite or two to get an initial taste to enjoy the broth flavor. Many people will put in healthy handfuls from the plate of veggies, twist the lime juice, throw in a sliced jalapeno pepper, and then squeeze some hoisin sauce (thick black sweet/tangy flavoring), and red Sriracha chili sauce (a little goes a long way as the Sriracha can overpower everything). Mix it up and enjoy. It is a two handed affair with the soup spoon in one hand and chopsticks in the other.\""}
{"text":"I thought they had a respectable pho and amazing spring rolls. I have to clarify on these spring rolls though, they had like a long solid stick of pork inside of them! I didn't care, it tasted amazing! The pho had good flavor, although I wish it came with as much steak as I get back at my favorite spots back home. I will come back here and try the banh mi but will keep looking around for pho, although I'm learning making your own pho is pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"I decided I should try this newly opened Vietnamese eatery since I've tried all the others.  The interior is nicely decorated and comfy.  Oddly, there were no other diners in the restaurant at noon on a Friday.  I'll start with the things I didn't like.   First, the door was propped open. This resulted in several flies walking up and down the inside of the window next to me and occasionally buzzing down around my food.    Second, the summer rolls, while good, were not particularly flavorful.  The roast pork in them seemed bland and the only thing I really tasted was the basil.  They came with a peanut based sauce that was thick and topped with more peanuts.    Third, the com dish (broken rice with grilled pork) didn't seem to have any herbs.  There was no cilantro or basil.  The rice was good but I've had better.  The pork appeared to be a thin cut pork chop and while the flavor was good I encountered quite a bit of fat and gristle in the meat. The dish came with a chopped piece of tomato, cucumber and two sauce bowls.  One contained sweet nuoc mam and the other had a light colored broth with some bits of scallion floating in it.  The latter didn't seem to have a lot of flavor and tasted almost like a watered down soup of some sort.    The dish did have a nice piece of Vietnamese meat-loaf on the plate and this was quite flavorful.    The best part of the meal was the bahn mi which I took back to work.  The flavor was outstanding.  The sauce, cilantro and jalapeno were very flavorful.  The size of the sandwich was great for $2.95 (hard to believe).    The bread, however, was uniformly soft rather than having a crusty exterior as I've come to expect from bahn mi.  Also, the grilled pork had quite a bit of gristle and I found myself removing a couple hard to chew pieces from the sandwich.    In their favor, Saigon Grille has only recently opened so hopefully they'll work out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Straight panned.   The only reason I didn't give this place one star is because I'm alive to write this review.  \"Pad Thai\". Should be fairly simple, no?   The lady who was working at the front counter was reminiscent of the angry convenience store lady in \"Don't Be a Menace to South Central...\" supermarket scene.. Seriously! \"Hurry up and buy!\"   So rude, every single thing  I said seemed painful and crisis inducing. She was irritated, impatient, and harsh.  The Pad Thai sucked! What's with the mystery juice that all seeped into one corner? Yuck! It was thick, salty, and sweeter than eating a truck bed of Smarties in one gulp. I felt like I was on a grip of valium after this too, which didn't help when I had to finish out my day at work. Price was decent, but who cares if it sucks this bad.   No way! Never again. Left our carry containers out front on the picnic table and dipped in return for the bad service and ruff meal."}
{"text":"I remember the days when It was hard to find a bowl of Pho in Cleveland, now there lined up on Superior Ave. The Pho was good, better than most, but not great. It had plenty of meat in it, but I found the broth to be a bit on the bland side for me. The Goi Cuon (spring roll), ours with pork was outstanding, It was amazing the charcoal flavor they achieved on the pork  in this dish. The same could be said with the Banh Mi, ours with chicken, again the meat grilled to perfection, served on a warm baguette with plenty of crisp carrot, daikon radish, cucumber, jalapeno and cilantro with a good smear of mayo. By far the best I have had in Cleveland. The place was clean and the staff friendly and efficient. The only parking is on the steet."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho in the neighborhood - not overly salty, and hefty portions at a cheap price.  My only gripe is that the spoons are so small!!  I want to get a big heaping mouthful of your delicious broth - but can't!    Decor is more upscale then the other joints in the neighborhood, and the staff is very helpful and friendly.  Great for business lunch, mid-day date :), or just a great bowl of noodles on a cold day!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Sure, it's in the middle of an old run down industrial part of Cleveland.  And yes, there are plenty of stray cats running around in the parking lot (that's a good thing, right?) The inside though is light and airy and very clean looking.  The service which has been so poorly frowned upon in other reviews has been pleasant when I visited. However... both times I've been there it's been virtually empty. I figured it probably has more to do with the exterior because the food is really good.  They also have all sorts of exotic sounding beverages and beer and maybe even wine or liquor, I can't remember for sure. The pho is excellent and they have tons of options.  It ranges in price from about $7-$10, which is a good value in my book. The Banh Mi with pork is very good and pretty substantial.  I've also had the spring rolls with the peanut sauce.  I could go for those right now, now that I'm thinking about it!  It does look like their prices on the appetizers have raised bit since I first visited, but it's still worth a trip!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I don't always drown myself, but when I do it will be in a bowl of Pho.  Just a warning the Large Pho is enough for 2 people.  I could barely finish 1/2. They even have one that is bigger than the Large! Enough for a family of 20! The broth was typical pho flavor, The eye of round and well done brisket were beefy!.  I jazzed mine with basil, rooster sauce, lime and bean sprouts.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  My friend and I split  the pork summer roll. That pork was cooked perfectly. Very good. Then we split the pork spring roll, it was a little underwhelmed.   The service was very friendly.  When I asked the waitress to pack the Pho she did not know how to get it in the cup, spilled it on the table! I had to take over!  Another solid place in Cleveland's little China Town!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the good reviews about the banh mi here, I had to give it a try, and it definitely lived up to expectations. I've had their grilled pork banh mi several times now, and let me just say that they don't call themselves Saigon GRILLE for nothing. It might be THE best grilled pork I've ever had. It is packed with smoky, juicy, delicious flavor, and in the sandwich, it blends perfectly with the mayo, lettuce, cilantro, jalapenos, and French bread. It's also very cheap (under $4) for what you get in quality and quantity, so you'll usually find me getting a handful of sandwiches to go.  During my most recent visit (and my first time dining in), I decided to try their Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. I mean if the pork is good in a sandwich, it's gotta be good over some noodles, right? Not so much. I mean, the pork was still amazing, but everything else, especially the cha gio, was just meh and really brought the dish down. The large serving size was the only other redeeming quality. I've had better at a lot of places, so I probably wouldn't come here for it again.  Misc... The service was friendly and attentive, food prep was lightning fast, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Ahhh...Cleveland Asia town keeps growing bit by bit.  It's exciting to see new restaurants pop up and I can hardly keep up with trying them all.  I've had the opportunity to try this place a couple of times and some of the items really impressed while some fell a bit short.   First I've always had great service.  Everyone I've come across working was personable and efficient.  However, I'm not sure if you're supposed to take the check up to the register after you're done or wait for it to be picked up since both have happened.  But because everyone was so sweet I'm making this a four star joint. The spring rolls are some of my new favorites in town.  Made the way I grew up eating them.  Smaller, crispy and filled with more meat than veggies.  The bun (vermicelli) with pork was perfect with grilled bbq pork and a tangier nuoc mam (fish sauce).  I was also a big fan of the bahn mi.  for 2.95 you really can't beat the price.  However, I would switch up the mayo.  The white mayo from a jar just doesn't go with any bahn mi.. We've tried several broken rice dishes, all tasty and comforting.  The lemon grass chicken contained strong lemon grass flavor and with the standard tomato, cucumber and lettuce.   On a visit with my parents, my dad loved his durian smoothie.  It was thick and contained real durian, not a powder.  I don't really like the smell of rotting garbage so I stayed away from it and got the avacado smoothie.  It was served lukewarm and tasted like a really creamy plain guacamole.  I would have rathered dipped some chips in it than drink it.  Kinda disappointing.  The pho was just ok.  I like a really meaty broth thats not too sweet but this one was a little watered down.  Raw meat was available for extra but it's worth it.  Also, the chicken salad was a little salty.  All the main components were there but it was just too salty."}
{"text":"Saigon Grille is tasty. Modern Authentic Vietnamese atmosphere.  Friendly staff.  Vegetarian friendly menu and cooks.  This is my  new favorite lunch spot.  Hits the pocket book a little bit, but the quality of food is definitely worth it.  This food is no imitation.  It tastes great.  Its on what I will call little Saigon row in Cleveland.  You will know it when you visit there.  I would be curious to see what this place is like at night or on the weekends.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I think this place definitely qualifies as a hidden gem.  Most of my Asian friends have never been here because (1) we equate Vietnamese food with pho and (2) we already have a go-to place for pho - that is, Superior Pho - just down the street.    Anyway, I happened upon this place the other week.  There wasn't much in the way of clientele because, as mentioned, this was a new restaurant among tough competition.  But either way, I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't actually try the pho, but this restaurant offers two other Vietnamese options that both tasted pretty decent: vermicelli noodle and broken rice dishes.  And similar to pho, you can choose different combinations of meat to go into each of these dishes.  I think this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here for a rainy day take out order.  Parked on the street right in front of the restaurant and there seemed to be no problem finding a spot. Restaurant is highly visible, right on Superior.  Ordered a banh mi and  vermicelli with grilled pork and spring rolls to go.  The lady said it'd take 5 minutes, and quite literally, 5 minutes later the food came out.  Took it home and ate it right away, spring rolls were still steaming hot and the vermicelli was decent. Pork was good, but portions were just moderate..I was still hungry after finishing the vermicelli dish.  Not a whole lot of vegetables included, I would have liked more lettuce and sprouts.    Saved the banh mi for lunch the next day, and it remained delicious.  Bread had understandable gotten slightly dry a day later, but the meat tasted fantastic.  Again, portion was slightly smaller than I would have liked, but overall flavor was very good.    Overall, the price was reasonable, the food tasted good, and its close my work.  I'll be coming back for my Vietnamese cravings"}
{"text":"Upon seeing the nicely decorated, well lit, and CLEAN interior, I quickly assumed that the food would be subpar and overpriced. I'm glad to say my first impression was wrong!  The food is delicious..perfect for the cold weather! Prices are reasonable, and the staff is gracious and accommodating.   I can't believe I found a Vietnamese restaurant with excellent service and decor to match their food!"}
{"text":"I can't wade into the Cleveland pho debate, as I've never really gotten past the banh mi on the menu here. I go for the grilled pork, which is incredibly good, and like the other varieties, incredibly cheap. It appears under \"appetizers\" on the menu, and only costs $3.95. It is hard to imagine a better bargain. I've also enjoyed the rare beef salad when that crunchy bahn mi just isn't enough. This is a good place."}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese food at a reasonable price.  I've been here a few times at both lunchtime and dinnertime.  For appetizers, I like the shredded pork rolls.  The vermicelli is also decent too.  The rice specialty (pork chop, roast pork, and egg) is a good sampler of many of the items on the menu.  Tasty, but I wish the portion size was a bit larger.  The soup is okay.  I've tried the pho and also the large rice noodle soup.  Of the two I like the pho better.  But the broth is not as flavorful as in other places I've been to.  The service is good though.  I didn't realize that one of the menu items had something that I didn't want, and when I mentioned it to the waitress, the dish was redone without any hassle.  I appreciated how this was handled smoothly."}
{"text":"Standard vegetarian section on the menu. I got the pho, and it was delicious. But only order the large if you're a giant human being, or there are two of there to share it, because the bowl is bigger than your head! For a vegetarian broth I thought it was super tasty. The spring roll appetizer was also generous in portion size. Good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Great pho and probably one of the best banh mi sandwiches in Cleveland (get the grilled pork).  After dinner coffee was the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Very large menu compared to Superior Pho, just about the same I think as Minh Anh on the west side of Cleveland. Their pho was great but I still prefer Superior but their banh mi was delicious (and cheaper too). I still need to try their other dishes to give an accurate rating for Vietnamese food but as of right now with pho and the banh mi, I'm content to give this place a four star."}
{"text":"The pad thai noodles is great. It has a hint of salty, sour and spicy which what good pad thai noodle should be. I been ordering hot Vietnamese coffee with sweetened milk. It's nice coffee aroma and roasty flavor."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Best food we've had in a while. We had delicious rolls wrapped in rice paper with marinated pork in them. I ordered the chicken pad thai and my husband had the #56 which was a marinated pork chop, fried egg and rice. Our server, Lee, was so nice, friendly and helpful. She gave us the best service we've had in Cleveland in a while. Delicious food, amazing service and a spotless restaurant - we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE Saigon Grille. I love it when I need comfort food, when I'm hungover, or really whenever I'm in the area. The Bahn Mi sandwich (with pork, of course) is to die for. I have eaten two in one sitting. I have tried a few different types of pho but my favorite is the Pho Ga. Which is chicken. hey load you up with toppings and it is PRETTY darn cheap for the portions and quality. I get carry out at least every other week!"}
{"text":"Yet another brave attempt at a Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland - but still not good enough. I'm still very frustrated that I cannot recommend a Vietnamese restaurant for my friends to try. I know, its tough, but being Vietnamese myself, I can't just send them anywhere. I guess I need to continue cooking at home instead of going out for Vietnamese!   I have only had the pho (and in my opinion, if you can't get this right, then forget it). Wow, the pho lacked flavor. I actually questioned if they had even used meat/bones in the stock. Ginger? Cinnamon? Anise? Reminded me of instant pho!! I got the large for $8.95, whoa pricey and average sized (not large). Good news is that they weren't skimpy on the sides, basil and bean sprouts were plentiful (unlike Pho 99). The type of bowl that the pho was served in was wide and shallow, which if you know about pho, you are looking for deep (keeps the soup warmer longer).   My brother and family have tried the bun bo hue (spicy noodle soup), bun (cold noodle dish) and com (broken rice) and have commented how the portions are so small. The flavor is lacking excitement, seems like someone who learned how to cook this food secondhand instead of making it their passion. I was there on a Sunday for lunch, and if you are Asian, you know if it's a good restaurant, it would be packed. We were one of 3 other tables - not so good.   I did give them a star for at least trying - I think there is promise but they have to work on their spices and depth of flavor. Vietnamese food has so much more to offer than this."}
{"text":"I've gone back 4 times in one week. I think I'm a bahn-mi-holic. SO yummy. My bf asks everyday to go back, and I just have to say no because it's so bad for our waistline as we eat 2 sandwiches each time. Have to stave off until next week. It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nothing very special about this place but I only tried their pho and it was decent. Portion size was pretty generous too. It is slightly pricier than superior pho, but the restaurant looks nicer and cleaner. Their waiters and waitresses were very nice and they are fully supportive of birthday surprise parties!!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place since I saw the sign a couple of months back.... Finally it's open! Yaying!!  The positives: The menu is far the MOST extensive, varying from phos (beef noodles), mi (yellow egg noodles), bun (vermicelli), com tam (broken rice) etc. compared to the other viet restaurants around the Cleveland area. The variations excites me because it transport me back to California, so much to choose from :) Most importantly, the food was very good. We ordered the beef salad, pho tai, bun with pork, shrimp, and egg rolls and cafe sua.  It's always comforting to see this place is legit because most of the other patrons were Vietnamese too!   Now, the not so positives...given that they barely just opened their doors, service was a little off. Hopefully in time, this will improve. The servers were very kind, you just have to be patient and ask a couple of times. We weren't too concern about that problem though. And to warn you, this place also advertises itself as Thai cuisine--other than thai tea, and tom yum soup, there's nothing Thai about this place.  My fiancé gives them a solid 4, since he's a self proclaimed pho connoisseur, and once he had it there, he doesn't believe it's their specialty. I give them a 5, mostly because of the menu and the food is above par. It also makes me feel like our little Asian Town is growing. Warms my heart."}
{"text":"I thought it was good. My dining companion thought it was just pretty good. She prefers other places for pho. The place is modern on the inside. The toilet was really cool. It was a black one. That impressed me. Above the toilet was a sign that read \"Xin dung bo giay vao toilet. Cam on\" which means \"Please do not throw paper towels in the toilet. Thank you\". Cam on meaning \"thank you\" is funny to me because in English if you say that, it means like, hurry up or get with it. I was there on a Saturday night and wish that there were more people around. The banh mi is also only a few dollars, which is a great value."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  It was to be the day I lost $630 cash in a PNC envelope, but it turned out to be the day I found the best Bun (vermicelli noodle) salad in town. (And it eventually turned out to be the day before a kind Samaritan found and returned my money--after the cops told me that no one would be that honest--hooray for decent Clevelanders!)  OK, got that? People are surprisingly good sometimes, and Saigon Grille has amazing Bun, adorned with nice fat shrimp and juicy bits of barbecued pork (though I would get it without the egg rolls, which tasted strangely sour and stale to me--bad oil perhaps?).   This same barbecued pork also comes stuffed into SG's Banh Mi, which is a super steal at only $3.75.  You can also get grilled chicken in the sandwich, but it's not as succulent, in my opinion.   All this being said, I went back the other day, forewarned about their lackluster Pho, and found it to be truly meh and the Summer Rolls very dry. Nevertheless, there are a number of good dishes to be had at SG--just be a little selective.  *One interesting quirk about SG is that it seems to attract a lot of single diners. Two lone women, sitting at different tables, were there when I went to nurse my wounds after losing my cash, and by the time I had finished my meal, a couple of guys had come in.  Hmm? Maybe this restaurant also has some romantic potential (wink, wink)."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep in simple: come for the grilled food, and only if you don't mind bad service. The woman working at the front is seriously one of the rudest people I've ever encountered in a restaurant. She seems annoyed to even bring over a menu. Her attitude alone set me off to not want to come back.  I have been here multiple times however, because my boyfriend loves the grilled pork here. I have to say that the grilled pork is quite good, but for me it doesn't quite make up for the bad service (especially when the restaurant isn't even that busy during an average lunch hour).  Pho is nothing special, and a bit expensive compared to the other places around. Me and my friend both ordered the lunch special for 10.95 (a bowl of pho, a soda, and two spring rolls) which wouldn't be a bad deal except his bowl was literally twice as filled as mine was when they brought it out. When I inquired the server as to why this was, he explained that it was because he had ordered the special. I ignored the fact that we had BOTH ordered the special and waved it off as a miscommunication...funny when I got the bill, they made no mistake about CHARGING us both for the special. Safe to say I will not be back anytime soon."}
