{"text":"Even though I dont live by there anymore, I still try to visit when I can.  Nice people there."}
{"text":"Not a restaurant. It's a bar. Super dive bar (not hip dive bar like Gooskis) more like real shady bar. also some one got shot here 3 times a few weeks ago around 8pm.  SHADY. but if you just go there to by 40s it should be fine."}
{"text":"Wow.  I remember over 30 years ago my college buddies and I use to hang out here a lot.    My first drink ever was in this place. I remember my friends and my conversation before heading to here  for my first drink."}
{"text":"It's classified under dive bars for a reason. It's a hole in the wall establishment that was great. I've driven past it a couple times not sure what it was like, so typically i'd proceed to the more pricey, lit up bars further down Western Ave. Last night i was feeling adventurous, so i popped in. The bartender was a women in her late 60's, early 70's named Terry. She said she's never seen me there before and made conversation, tough as nails yet wonderful at the same time. I walked to the end of the bar to see what beer was in the cooler, turns out that I found the 40's cooler and where the bar dog's bed is. He's a little man, believe a shitzu. Great addition to the bar, that is if you're a dog person. The crowd was diverse, yet everyone was kind and respectful.  After eating Nicky's Thai, I know where I'll go for my beer dessert. If you're a dive bar kind of person this is the place.  Note : This place is a smoking bar, so if you're not into that may not be your place."}
