{"text":"We have been going to Heimatland for many years now.  I love everything about this place! The menu has something for everyone and the food is delicious.  I've never had a bad meal here once and, we probably eat here about twice a month and have for years.  I also love their beer selection and that they carry Oktoberfest German beer, there is nothing better.  If I could change one thing about this place, it would be their music selection as, they don't have any.  The only sound you hear is the television from the bar.  Would love for this place to play some traditional German music, the atmosphere in the restaurant could really use a boost."}
{"text":"On the road from Columbus to Niagara Falls, we decided to stop in and it was definitely worthwhile. The classics in the Sausage Platter and appetizer sampler were delicious and the Saurekraut Balls were amazing! Overall, delicious food, adorable atmosphere, friendly service, and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Had a Wiener Schnitzel with red cabbage and Sp√§tzle which definitely pleased my German palate. Same with the potato pancake appetizer and import beer. For dessert I had a Dobos torte which was probably not prepared in the 'Old World way' (chocolate layers were 'syrupy' rather than 'buttercreamy'), but still enjoyable. Service was prompt , friendly but not intrusive. Very clean establishment. As others have indicated already, the murals on the walls are not gonna win a hipness competition, but that design is seemingly a must for ALL German restaurants in North America (Same applies to corny restaurant names). Overall very pleasant experience, my only real beef with 'Heimatland' was that is was located right next to an Arby's."}
{"text":"Great food. amazing, quaint atmosphere. Friendly service. Its a place that takes you out of the bustle of everyday life and sets you in an german village. Love it! The pork schnitzel is great!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad that people are knocking this restaurant because of the decor, or the service. I personally know the owners and they are super nice and want nothing more than their customers to be happy. Sure, the decor could really use some updating, but it's more of a down home family restaurant than a fine dining experience. And that doesn't mean that the food isn't delicious.   On another note, expect to wait a bit for your food on a Sunday morning - there are typically 3 servers, but any restaurant you try to go to on a Sunday morning is going to have a heavy church crowd - that's part of the deal. You shouldn't go in expecting it to be the best experience of your life - but you should definitely go in expecting friendly service and a smile to greet you."}
{"text":"Great food, owned by GREAT people. I must say that after reading a previous review by someone named \"Jill C\", I was very offended by the words she used to describe the owner. That man is my grandfather whom I have great respect and love for. It's sad that people on here feel the need to personally attack others, especially a 90 year old man, MY FAMILY, someone that has worked so hard his entire life to support his family, to achieve his dream after coming to this country. Shame on you. And shame on the Yelp admin for deciding to keep her review up after I reported it as offensive. It offended one of your app users and that should be enough to take it down. No one's family should be disrespected on here, I don't care what the situation. .that's just mean. It could have been left at \"I didn't have a good experience here\", the personal attack on my grandfather could have been left out."}
{"text":"We were treated to a lecture by the Nazi proprietor about how \"you think Hitler was a monster \" and continued to tell us what a great leader he was, and that the U.S. used to be a great country but isn't anymore. Worst restaurant experience ever. I hope Yelp removes this atrocity from its list of recommendations. How did we know he was a  Nazi? He regaled us with his war stories and I had to run out"}
{"text":"Just ate there for lunch today and they have some great $6.00 lunch specials. The pork schnitzel and chicken paprikas were excellent. They do have a facebook page with hours of operation listed there."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area. Love the staff, always get a thank you for coming in and they always ask how things are going. Very good bacon and they cook it perfect.  Have tried all the breakfast items and have not had one bad meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here solely to try the pierogi's (on our monthly excursion). It was pretty empty during a Saturday afternoon which was okay with us! We had the sample platter and lots of beers to go around- only $4 a piece! I ordered pierogi's with haluski and it was delicious! For the price of everything I would come back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on a Saturday morning. Ordered the country schnitzel, which came with biscuits and gravy and 2 eggs and potatoes. The biscuit was from a tube, but the gravy was good. The potatoes were prepared well, but not hot. The rest was good.   Daughter got the cheese omelette which had sliced cheese both inside and on top.  It was good.   Also, the place has a full bar so I ordered a Bloody Mary. Waitress forgot about and made it promptly when I asked again. I think she hit it with an extra shot of vodka. It was good.   Servers are friendly. Place is small. There was a big group having breakfast which slowed things down a bit. Worth coming back to, but won't make a special trip."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants.  It claims it is a German culture center.  But there is noting going on there.  The staff is not friendly. The service is bad.  The decor is horrible.  The food is terrible.  Food was either under cooked or overcooked.  it is pricey."}
{"text":"Basically what everybody said already.  Went here on yep reviewers recommendation and soooooo happy we did.  Bang for your buck, owner very very friendly, delicious food, we will be back"}
{"text":"Since they're just down the road from me I feel bad that we don't stop by more often.  I had to pull back on one star because the Schnitzel that my wife had the other night had a slightly off oil taste.  I've never been in the kitchen, but I assume that they cooked it in oil and not butter.  I had the Sausage dinner.....I can't seem to order anything else!    Brought the slice of Dobro torte home.  My wife is convinced it's the best and she eats a ton of sweets.  Bottom line......a really good bang for the buck, no waiting in lines to get in and rarely a disappointment.  Oh, and Warsteiner on tap!"}
{"text":"Service was decent, but not great.  They had a good selection of German beers on tap.  The food was pretty much authentic, although I thought my schnitzel should have been pounded more, and it was a tad dry.  The atmosphere was nice, although it wasn't very busy for 7:00pm (on a weekday).  I'd go back, but it would be nice to have a couple more servers around so it wouldn't be as much of a wait."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but man - the service is sloooowwwwwwww. My family and I would go out to breakfast on Sundays and place bets on how long it would take to get refills and the check. Everyone is really nice, I just don't think they have enough servers working at any given time.   The apple fritter French toast is the stuff that dreams are made of. I don't care for their coffee, but they serve a tasty orange juice. I've never had bad food from here. I like it a lot.   Sometimes I take my boyfriend here for breakfast when he's in town before we head out to Cedar Point or somewhere fun. If you get tired of waiting for them to take your check and your money has been out for 20 minutes or more, I hate saying this, but walk it up to the bar and say you need change. They'll help you out right away. This is the only restaurant I've ever had to do it in. They're nice so they don't mind, but it feels rude. But sometimes you've been waiting, waiting, waiting, and waiting and you really just have to get somewhere."}
{"text":"The place was very clean and the decor is what you'd expect for a German restaurant. It's tasteful, but not overbearing. The server was very friendly and knowledgable. Prices were very good ($10 to $12) and the food was excellent.  I'm very happy I picked this place to eat. Very surprised!"}
{"text":"Well this place is very simple and quent. I really enjoyed the simple German decor and the atmosphere. It isn't a 5 star restaurant or bar. It is a simple German restaurant with simple authentic German food. The owner is an old man from Austria. I mean like WWII old! He is really nice and very willing to come talk to customers, really giving it that warm down-home feel. I had the German sausage platter and it was good, especially for 11 bucks! Their Paulander hefeweizen beer was perfect with diner. I also recommend the Chicken Paprika, great flavor. Most of the dishes have a very simple taste, but enjoyable. I will definitely go back. It is a very interesting place and I like to support the locals!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place to eat. The service was great and the food was delicious. I had honey covered fried chicken and let me tell you it was the best chicken I have had to date. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family and it was very good.  They were able to accommodate a party of six including one handicap person with no issues.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I must say, my grandma used to make me spatzle and this place was just as good as hers.  My cousin had sausage which I thought had great flavor.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Schnitzel, beer and sausages. My holy trifecta. This place does not disappoint when it comes to German food. Love that the owners are often in there talking to patrons. You can tell from the accents that they're the real deal. Place is really cute inside too. Pretty German murals on the wall. Great German beers on draft. And I literally haven't had a bad item on the menu. On a warm day they have a patio you can sit on. You lose the German ambiance, but hey, you get to sit outside. If dining solo they also have a little bar with a tv you can sit at.  I've been here for lunch, dinner and often get take out. My mouth is watering just thinking about the potato pancakes and red cabbage. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great the food was fast. Authentic dishes with sampler options. It's oddly located in a German business center but its worth the stop."}
{"text":"It's nearly 2013 and this restaurant doesn't have a website or even an informative voicemail when you call their #. How are curious people supposed to find out when they are open?? Someone needs to introduce these owners to the fact that this is the Information Age."}
