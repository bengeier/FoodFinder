{"text":"I went there on a Thursday morning and found the service very poor.  Our waiter seemed half-asleep, and he was the only one on staff (granted, the place was empty - we were the only ones there for about 20 minutes).  I don't believe he spoke English or French very well.  The food took quite a while and when it came it was very mediocre.   The bill for two people was relatively high ($35) for breakfast and the food was just not worth it.  I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I had the Grilled or poached salmon served with rice, vegetables provincial tomato and dill sauce.  The menu said grilled or poached, they didn't ask which way I wanted it cooked.  It seems like the default cooking method is poached.  There is a nice casual atmosphere and a decent mix of items on the menu."}
{"text":"Conveniently located close to St Catherine street and within walking distance of Crescent, this Republique is one of my favorite joints in the area. The service is always quick, bilingual and polite. Portions are plentiful, well-presented and reasonably priced. I like their beer tap selection as well, particularly the Leffe.

Republique cocktails tend to err on the sweet side, which isn't my taste. But if you dig tropical and/or girly drinks, have one because they are delicious.

If you have the white wine sangria you will like it, but you will contribute significantly to the Cafe Republique profits.

So give it a try and be prepared to return."}
{"text":"Following a long agony and what appeared to be a flood, this Cafe is no more. It shall be missed. CLOSED."}
{"text":"Un endroit dont je vais me souvenir pour trois raisons :
1) C'est à la suite d'une discussion avec une serveuse de l'endroit que j'ai débloqué pour l'écriture et que je peux enfin écrire des centaines de pages sans me retrouver incapable de continuer quand l'inspiration est plus difficile;
2) C'est là que j'ai appris que la nouvelle copine de mon ancien patron était aussi sa cousine de 19 ans sa cadette;
3) J'y ai viré une des brosses les plus spectaculaires de ma vie.

Bref, c'est un endroit plus qu'inspirant, de classe et avec un service convenable. Intéressant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by our concierge on our first night and I have to say, I was disappointed.  My friend had the calamari and shrimp which was tasteless.  The escargot was not what it should taste like and was covered with oil and baked cheese.  I ordered a chicken dish with rice and salad which was also tasteless.  I do have to say at least the chicken was not dried.  But not a fan."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for supper yesterday before going to the movie theater.

We had a lot of free time before the movie (roughly 2 hours) so we didn't mind that there was a party upstairs (which, we understand, requires a lot of the staff's attention).

Upon arrival, we were told to take a seat, and that we would be brought menus shortly. It didn't happen. After over 25 minutes of sitting there and pretty much just staring at each other, while waiters after waiters skipped passed up without even so much as looking at us, we decided to go elsewhere.

When we got up and put our coat on, one of the waitresses asked us if everything was okay, to which I replied it was not, and that we were leaving. She asked ''Well, did you pay?'' PAY FOR WHAT? FOR THE MENUS WE NEVER RECEIVED? I politely told her we had not received any menus or any attention of any kind in the 25 minutes we were there. She laughed and told me we should have grabbed someone to tell them we were there !!! Extremely rude and unprofessional. I shouldn't have to TELL the staff I want a menu when I obviously came in to eat !!!

I'm never going back there even if I get paid to."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for breakfast before an afternoon Bruins vs. Habs game at the Bell Centre... and by breakfast I mean about 1/2 dozen beers or so.

I was going to go to Peel Pub, but it was packed and my girlfriend wasn't ready for the crowd first thing in the morning.  So we went right next door to République.  Aside from one other guy, we were the only ones there.  Of course him and the bartender were more then happy to give us a ration of smack talk, since we were decked out in our Bruins jerseys.  But it was all in good fun, and we were giving it back as much as we were taking it.

They serve mostly locally brewed beers, and the bartender suggested a Boréale Blonde since I had initially ordered a Molson Export.  I have to say, it was pretty good... and 5 pints later it made for a damn good pre-game breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We went on a Saturday night, which should have been quite busy but, surprisingly, it was not.  It's on the second floor with an outdoor balcony where you can sit and watch all the goings on on busy Rue St Catherine.  We were greeted warmly and seated immediately.  The food was actually reasonably priced and so was the wine!  I quite enjoyed it and we topped it off with one of their great tasting HUGE slices of cake.  Anyway, I highly recommend this place and next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be happy to go there again."}
{"text":"Had a decent meal here. Friends enjoyed escargot, Server was friendly and was happy that we didn't split the check. 
Nice place to have a light meal with a date."}
{"text":"Endroit sympa,accueil chaleureux mais un peu brillant normal si vous êtes au fond de la salle mais allez pour ce soir c'est un peu normal il y a un match de hockey le repas fut correct dans l'ensemble petit soupe à l'entrée brochette de buf comme plat mais cuisson de la viande à point et dessert un petit carré de gâteau.,par contre le café pas très bon."}
{"text":"I had: Quatre fromages 11.50
(Fromage brie, cheddar, suisse et bleu sur une galette végétarienne, tomates, laitue et basilic / Brie cheese, cheddar, swiss and blue over a vegetarian patty, tomatoes, lettuce and basil)
As expected, there was a bit too much cheese going on.  I didn't think I'd ever say that, but it's true in this case.  The veggie burger itself was tasty, as was the roll on which it was served.  The waffle fries were a bit on the greasy side, but the side salad was good (if not a little too soaked in dressing).  I highly recommend the Blonde ou Rousse beer on draft.  YUM."}
{"text":"We've come to Cafe Republique a couple of times in the last couple of months as we are planning our wedding at the Windsor Ballroom next door. It is the perfect place to meet with potential vendors, discuss plans and have a nice espresso. The ambiance is always nice and service is efficient. I like that they have Leffe Blonde on tap too!"}
{"text":"Ce café d'inspiration française, où le café coule à flot le matin, tout comme l'alcool en soirée, est situé à proximité du Théâtre du Nouveau monde (TNM) et des salles de spectacles rattachées à la Place des Arts. Aussi, il se remplit à pleine capacité avant chaque représentation ou spectacle, ne serait-ce que parce que c'est le seul endroit où on peut déguster un café au brandy dans les environs, qui sont par ailleurs peuplées de Second Cup, de Starbuck et deVan Houtte. Le café au République est excellent, et l'ambiance de ce café oblong, enivrante. Aussi, le menu du café affiche une bon choix de hamburgers, de sandwichs, de crêpes et de salades, mais je dois avouer ne jamais y avoir mangé. Du reste, si la nourriture est à la hauteur du café, je ne m'inquiète pas de la qualité de ses plats."}
{"text":"Skip it. Cafe Republique is a typical diner but with some deficiencies. My girlfriend and I stopped by for some coffee and dessert.

First of all, the menu has 5-10 different coffee drinks with no explanation of what each drink is. I asked our waitress for some clarification but she didn't know either! Eventually, after discussing with a few managers, she was able to explain some of the coffees so we ordered a few. 

Yuck. Honestly, I do not have high standard for coffee but I could barely drink mine.

Anyway, at least we saw that they had nice chocolate cake in the dessert case (although that was the ONLY item in the case) so we ordered a slice. Our waitress was excited and said \"great, the cake is so fresh!\". We were then excited too.

So we waited. And waited. And waited... the cake was 5 feet from us but it took 15 minutes to arrive because our waitress was very busy chatting! There was almost no one else in the restaurant and yet somehow the service was slow.

Unimpressed."}
{"text":"It was a good place for a 5-7 with a group on a friday, where all the pubs were filled to the top.

They have nice meal options, including vegetarian options. and got a nice selection of beers as well. Food is a bit pricy, though, but very nice."}
{"text":"Bonne musique , repas convenable et prix raisonnable .  Le service à la clientèle est normale ."}
{"text":"We went to the 3563 Saint-Laurent location and had a miserable dinner/time. The review gets 2 stars for the waitress, who was awesome, that is the only good thing this place has going for it!! 1.) The escargot came out almost cold, everyone knows that escargot is to be served hot. 2.) It took forever to get the bread, which should have been automatic, the service overall was very slow. 3.) The music was a bit loud, but it was ok, tolerable, we could still hear each other, and then the \"MOD\", aka \"the owner's daughter\" came in, apparently heard her jam by Britney Spears and decided to crank it up. We decided that it's better to freeze outside, than go deaf listening to Britney inside. We already ordered out food, so we felt bad leaving right then, and decided to stay. 4.) After waiting about an hour (no exaggeration) for our food, we \"dared\" ask the manager if they were understaffed that night, since we saw our waitress running around and apparently prepairing some food in the kitchen as well (she was warming up our bread earlier), and overheard the hostess saying so to another table, and got a response,\"Noooo!\" Packaged up with an eye roll and some attitude on the side. Are you kidding me?!!!! Is this the kind of service a restaurant provides? Is this how customers get treated?!! Nobody talks to me like that, especially in a place where I am a paying customer! Shocked and appalled we were! Shocked and appalled, I tell you!!! Thankfully our waitress knew how to calm us down, and get the situation under control, b/c I was about to slap the bitch! To cut the story short, when the food arrived it was gross, I hated mine, and my companion got sick from his. I couldn't resist but tell the waitress that she is too good for this place, and that she should leave. I don't know how other locations are, but the St.-Laurent location is plane HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING, DISAPPOINTING, and SUCKS ASS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by on a rainy Canada Day. Great breakfast and service. Recommended. Too bad we couldn't have discovered earlier and had dinner here as well."}
{"text":"We were planning on going somewhere else to watch the World Cup finals but when we got there, it was completely packed.  So with 10 minutes left until the start, we happened to find some seats here to watch the match.  It wasn't packed but had a good crowd that looked mostly like locals, nomming away on food with a pint in hand.  

The beer selection was fairly decent and the food options were extensive.  Having not eaten lunch, I was pretty peckish and so I ordered a plate of bruscetta which surprised me by having fresh tomatoes as its topping!  One of my companions had the fried calamari which was decent but had a wonderful dipping sauce which tasted highly of garlic (yum...garlic).

I only saw 2 waitresses but they were handling the room quite well and our waitress was great at keeping our drinks full and making sure we were quite taken care of.  She even offered to bring our bill before the end of the game so that we wouldn't have to wait after the game when everyone was trying to get theirs in."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem, hidden amongst the bars on Peel. I discovered it accidentally, mostly because I didn't want to go to Peel Pub or any other bars, and this restaurant is much (trés trés) classier! When I arrived, there weren't a lot of people downstairs (there was a group upstairs as well), and the bartender was very informed, and made me feel welcome! The drinks are decently priced as well. Since then, however, I've been back for food and drinks, both on my own and with groups. The food is pretty good, and their creme brûlée is quite nice. There is a carrot cake (with embedded cream cheese that is delightful! It gets really busy during hockey games, so plan ahead. Their staff is both very personable and informed, and will accommodate almost any request (they also have great lunch specials)! I have also ordered delivery on Justeat.ca, and in earnest, the quality of the food did not diminish in any way!"}
{"text":"I wanted to do ZERO stars but Yelp required at least one! Consumers beware!!! My husband and I went there for lunch on October 14, 2015 for lunch. After finishing lunch we gave the waitress our credit card to pay for our meals. Less than two hours later we received a fraud alert notification from our credit card company informing us that there had been two charges to our card from the Cafe' Republique restaurant! As a result of the fraudulent activities by someone in this restaurant our card was cancelled and a new one is being issued. We are in Montreal for a conference and have had this experience turn our first trip to Montreal very disappointing and stressful! Fortunately for us our credit card company caught this quickly and we won't be faced with paying for someone else's greed and dishonesty."}
