{"text":"Our family loves Sizzler!  Unfortunately we will never make the mistakes of going to this location again!  The manager (Neil) has a lot to learn about customer service!  As our family was enjoying our meal, we observed him enter into an altercation with a guest.  Then, as if that wasn't enough, he went over to the servers and started yelling at them. Highly unprofessional!  The food was ok. Typical for a sizzler but the salad bar left something g to be desired.  Food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old.  Overall a bad experience for 60 bucks!"}
{"text":"Wow it is been years since I have been doing cisler and now I know why they are all closing. I went in with my boss to buy her lunch I ordered shrimp scampi which came with a salad bar and I ordered myself the salad bar the salad in the salad bar was all wilted slimy and brown. After 15 minutes I went up to check on the scampi the cashier said that the button did not register and order it period so I offered to pay the difference and get it coming she told me know it'll be out momentarily. 15 minutes later I went up to ask again where the Stampy was at and she told me it already came out which it had not period Then a manager girl came up to me and told me that I did not pay for Stampy I told her the story she looked at me like I was a criminal. And told me that because they messed up Sizzler will cover the cost of the Stampy. 15 minutes later I could not find the manager girl so I opened the door to the kitchen area and asked her where the Stampy was she very rudely told me to get out of this area and that the food was coming. This will be the very last trip I ever take this is her and hopefully anybody reading this read my comments and does the same. I work for a lot of investors American and Canadian and I know they would love to have this building to put an actual restaurant that takes care of its people in its place. This Sizzler is a waste of food space and time when other efficient properly run restaurants could be there serving happy people"}
{"text":"Grossed me out eating here and our waitress was never around to see how we are doing or to take our plates. It grossed me out because while I was eating I looked up at the ceiling and saw a large bug, spider webs and dust. I wish I wasn't looking up because I don't know what I was putting in my mouth I looked down and saw a hair in my desert."}
{"text":"This is a real good place to eat. Everyone is so friendly. You feel welcome when you come in. We moved from Illinois and it has been our favorite place to eat. We will keep coming back. Cassandra is the very best waitress and we love her. Need to definitely keep her."}
{"text":"The food was really good, including the salad bar. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The portions were very generous. Bathrooms were a little dirty, but we just followed the dinner rush. Very satisfied with this meal."}
{"text":"Since I wrote the review praising  the steaks I am sad to say the quality has been downgraded. We ordered them on three different occasions, and although they were all cooked to the medium rare we asked for,  they were all tough, so we quit ordering steak. Haven't seen the obnoxious person whose aggressive selling drove us out of the restaurant, but we have learned to approach the counter with our eyes straight ahead because showing the slightest interest in the menu board is likely to activate one of the cashiers who will dart out from behind the counter and trap you with an unwanted and unstoppable explanation of each item. I will stick with the two star rating because the salad bar is ok and the servers are all nice - attentive without being pests."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give zero stars...over cooked steaks and unprofessional management made for a aweful experience....the server and management talking about my wife and I in Spanish made it all the more classy...keep driving...you'd get more class at a McDonald's..."}
{"text":"I have issues every time I come here.  The manager Renee is usually less than helpful.  While I enjoy the food and salad bar it's not worth the hassle to come here.  They refuse to make accommodations for people with special dietary restrictions which while I understand is \"company policy\" to do so with a smirk on your face is not needed or appreciated"}
{"text":"Have not had a rough steak like the one I am eating right now in a long time. Unlimited shrimp is not good at all."}
{"text":"The meat was very tough. Over priced for serving sizes. Cashier was rude as well. Won't be going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Food not good no selection..bad service +Qatar paid 25 Bucks for something like refried beans and salad ...Damm"}
{"text":"Decent place. A little pricey for a salad bar. I still think Old Country Buffet better for price. But Sizzler still OK. Brings back some memories from the 80s. Its a laid back atmosphere and the staff is super friendly. Good job there. Its not my favorite place for lunch or dinner, but is on my list to go. Worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"My kids wanted to go back, so of course, we went back. Not a good idea. The service didn't exist. Our plates were never cleared and our sodas never refilled. Horrible. Ice cream machine didn't work leaving 3 very upset kiddos. The best part was the flip that my stomach made during the long two mile trip home. I need to set far higher standards for my kids."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Sizzlers near our home.. We spent 30.00 for lunch.. Worst food ever.. Boyfriend ordered Beef tips and mushrooms.. Very grainy, no flavor.. He ate it because he was hungry.. I ordered Shrimp Scampi pasta.. No scampi about it.. It was some kind of bottled Alfredo sauce.. I did complain.. I never do it.. It looked liked the manager didn't even know what I was eating.. He called it scampi too.. Will never go back.. Sad that I was so excited to go there.. Iced tea was good.. Salad bar is nice.. Bathrooms ugh.. Don't get me start"}
{"text":"Sizzler is a great establishment that's worth the money. Their food's taste is usually satisfying and I have yet to have a bad experience with their food or their employees. The waitresses and other staff are always courteous and tentative towards their customers. They may not walk your drinks to your table, but you get to choose what table to sit at instead of them giving you an assigned table. After about 5 mins., they check your receipt and get you started with your order and how you want it. You're also given a choice of toast or cheesy bread. They usually take about 15-30 minutes to complete your entree. If that's too long for you, then you're better off at a fast-food joint. Good quality food takes time and their food is great! If you ordered a steak, then they usually tell you to check it before leaving you to make sure you're satisfied. They check-up on you enough to see how you're doing, while also clearing off your table to make room for more dishes or just to clean it off for you. I always see the staff cleaning or reorganizing, so you know the place looks nice and clean. One thing that people may not like is the fact that they are a little pricey, but a decent meal isn't cheap. These meals are usually made from raw resources, unlike most of the fast-food restaurants, that's mostly made from frozen packaging or aluminum cans. You're basically paying for the quality, which people really shouldn't complain about; but to each their own. People may also not like the fact that they package your food in the back or watch you package your food. The reason behind this is the fact that people were stealing way too much from their Salad Bar. That may seem greedy, but a business can't run if people are stealing all of the food and aren't being considerate of others eating at the Salad Bar. Overall, this place is an excellent dine-in restaurant because they have great, tasteful food, their employees are very nice and tentative, and they serve great quality food at a favorable price. I would definitely recommend others to give this place a try. (:"}
{"text":"The food is subpar.  I became preoccupied with questioning how clean food was after going I to bathroom.  The bathrooms were disgusting.  Men's bathroom smelled like urine from 10 ft away but women's bathroom was worse. Like old tampons or something......I gagged walking out. The two waitresses in our section were absolutely great.  I'm sorry they have to work in a dump like this."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Restaurant was very clean. Salad bar was clean and fresh. Service was prompt and friendly. Steak was a bit over cooked & a little tough, but not a disaster. Unlimited shrimp special is a real winner!!"}
{"text":"Sizzler is good. Generic salad bar but the clam chowder is amazing. I like going here. BUT don't order to go. They have no lids for salad dressing and nothing to put the soup in. And no to go cups"}
{"text":"Why 3 stars?   Restaurant space & dining area - Clean  and tidy Soups and salads - A decent amount of selections. Fresh veggies and yummy hot soups.  Appetizers - Complete selection from like Taco bowls,  shredded  pork,  hot wings,  fried battered chicken wings etc.. Entrees - A little over priced but worth it.  Good quality and the right quantity Dessert - 6/10 Staff - very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Salad bar has plenty of offerings...skip the steak...sent first one back and second one was only marginally better. Definitely not worth the $85 bill for six people."}
{"text":"I have actually only been to Sizzler once in my life and it was last night. The experience was pretty good on the whole and about what I expected it to be.   I enjoyed the salmon that I ordered and my wife's steak was also pretty good especially for the price. However, the salad bar was majorly lacking including the desserts. I didn't find much of anything that I liked there nor did my wife. At least the main entrees were pretty good. The service was not bad, but I didn't understand the point of having a waiter when we placed our order at the front."}
{"text":"Dirty carpet, mopping the floor when people were walking.. steak was awful!! I used to love Sizzler too! wow.. just shaking my head how do u mess up a sizzler? The staff was really nice though.. I feel sorry for them working at that dump..fail!"}
{"text":"I travel for work so I'm always looking for good food thats not fast food. I've been in Arizona almost four months now and this place does not disappoint. Every employee is very nice (just one not so nice one), the food is always great and cooked properly, the salad bar is always fresh (no green lettice) and there is a nice selection.   The one thing I would say is that it would be nice to have the chilled plates for the salad, but it's a little thing. Definately won't stop me from coming to this location."}
{"text":"Like so many others who have posted here, I hadn't been to Sizzler since I was a child in the 80s. Thus, when I discovered this location, of course my wife (also an 80s child who remembered Sizzler fondly) and I wanted to go. This mistake, after two extremely disappointing experiences, will not happen again.  First time we went, the food was less than desirable to say the least. We got the salad bar, and the food we got from it either was stone cold or had a funky flavor. After that, we decided just to skip the course meals and get salad. This was no better. The lettuce tasted like it had just been pulled out of the dumpster, and the tomatoes, peppers, brocoli and cucumbers tasted like they were well past usage date. The foul taste was evident even with salad dressing atop it. We took a few bites, and couldn't eat another bite without gagging. After, we decided to call it a loss and left. A few months later, we decided to try again figuring maybe it was just an off day. We avoided the salad bar this time and purchased off the menu hopeful our experience with the food would be better than the salad bar one. Unfortunately, it was WORSE.. I cut into my chicken and it was so undercooked, they may as well have given it to me right out of the freezer.. It couldn't have spent more than 3 minutes on the grill. My wife's salmon mercifully was cooked... A little TOO much. It was burnt to a crisp and even less edible than my undercooked piece of food poisoning... err chicken. From there, we decided we'd had enough.   The waitresses we had both were nice and everyone we encountered at the restaurant seemed to be as well. However, the product was stomach churning. I don't know if food quality has gone down in the 26 years since I was last in Sizzler, or as a kid anything tasted good, however to say the quality of food was poor would be a mild understatement."}
{"text":"this was my first visit to a Sizzler and I thought it was pretty good. The shrimp dinner I ordered was not that great but the salad and dessert bar made up for that. The place is no Golden Corral by any means but what they got is pretty good , you will leave with a full belly . the service was good and I was able to make a strawberry shortcake from the dessert bar. So I will say YAY I am a fan!"}
{"text":"This is not the Sizzler you remember from childhood! The food is tasteless the shrimp are over cooked nd mine smelled suspect so I didn't eat it. Early dinner was 23.00 which is grossly overpriced for a tiny steak which was cooked beyond the medium rare i ordered. In fact the only thing edible in my opinion was the salad bar, sweet rolls and steamed veggies. So for 23.00, I would skip this place! Eat well and be happy!"}
{"text":"Hmm I find it interesting many people are complaining about the same thing. Horrid service. I don't know who is the manager in this particular place but you need to train your employees or better yet get trained yourself by the corporate office. I was on vacation with my wife. She order shrimp ...Let me say this I can not eat shrimp. I will blow up like a fish...( Think Will Smith in \"Hitch\") I am  steak and potato kind  of guy. I had the waitress literally hovering over us like we just walk into Fort Knox, There is no gold here people just trying to chow down after a long day and enjoy my wife;s  beautiful company. Anyway at the end she said oh I can take that to the kitchen to box it up? What??? Isn't it customary to bring the  box to the table. If you think I'm going to trust some to take my left overs to the kitchen to do who knows what your are dearly mistaken. Manager take note: This is not the way to treat paying customers. I am seeing a trend here after seeing people experiencing similar service . Now I know I am not the only one. Will I ever go back? Never again. Can I in good conscience recommend this place? Heavens no..run for the hills unless you want to get I.D. at the door give them your social...let them know what size of underwear you wear. You get the picture people. You got a complaint? Make a Official Complaint to Corporate Office. Customer Beware!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch around 1 on Saturday.  This buffet style order, get your drink find a seat.  Our order, trip tip with mushrooms, onions, baked potato. Shrimp and steamet broccoli. Diet Coke Unsweetened tea. You can add on the soup, side and salad bar.  We did. You can just order the buffet only. Good variety of items on the salad bar, 3 varieties of soup. Chicken wings, pasta, taco bar and dessert bar. Our server came immediately to say hello. Friendly and offered us garlic toast. Our order came quickly, I was just finishing my salad. Trip tip with grilled mushrooms and onions, delicious! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Baked potato hot and fresh with butter, sour cream and green onions. My salad with romaine and spring mix was also good, quality items for the salad bar. Shrimp , broccoli, clam chowder also delicious. Nice afternoon at Sizzler's, good job, we will return when we are in the area."}
{"text":"CHEESE TOAST *drops mic, walks away*  I grew up in Southern California in the 80's and being a Hispanic kid, that made Sizzler the go to birthday celebration spot. The chain has sunk into a big decline over the years and I've gone to some pretty ganky one in New Mexico and West Phoenix that have since closed. But this one in Mesa, is pretty damn awesome. Friendly wait staff, clean airy layout plus a nice wood floor and not carpeting make it modern and not a weird throwback. Their steaks are flavorful and not chewy even when I get medium or medium well and they have a really nice salad bar selection from potato salads, seafood, cole slaw and pasta, good soups and pasta and mexican  hot foods that are great. I really like their cheeseburgers and the steak fries and sauce they come with. If you're in a pinch, check this place out, good cheap food and a nice place to grab lunch and maybe make a meatball taco ;)  Plus CHEESE TOAST!"}
{"text":"Save your $ and time, go somewhere else!  1st there are a TON of \"snow birds\" that eat here. I mean the entire place is covered with white haired individuals and you will overhear their loud conversations about the \"multiple surgeries\" and \"horrible symptoms\" of this and that... It's obnoxious. In fact, when we walked in two elderly couples blatantly cut in front of us. The lady at the register saw it, and did nothing. Evidently, unless your old you are second rate here.  2nd on a Friday night at 6pm they were out of salmon? What? So we both got the alfredo. Bad choice. Even our waitress commented \"I think it's disgusting here\"... why is it on the menu then for $13.99?! It tasted like a smart ones microwavable dinner. Gross and watery with ZERO flavor.    3rd their salad bar was OK - no tomato soup, onion rings, sprinkles or cheese toast (staple items at the Sizzler I once worked at).  Overall, we paid over $30 for bad service and terrible food. We won't be back and I don't recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was quite pleased with this restaurant.  It was clean and staff was very friendly!  The salad bar was clean and all the food on the bar was fresh.  They also had the best ripe fresh fruit!  We ordered steaks and shrimp and both were good and cooked as we ordered.  The waiter was good also would say great but he forgot my A1 sauce and I had to go ask for someone to bring me some."}
{"text":"Not bad, avacados on the salad bar? Awesome! While some of the seating arrangements just feel weird (we ended up sitting near what was an exit door, and it was hard to tell until people filtered out) They had decent prices, and the fact they had avacados on the salad bar, and they were fresh and green, was a winner with me!!"}
{"text":"Things took a downhill turn on my second visit. The French Onion soup was cold and dreary while the broccoli and cheddar tasted like Campbells. The worst was the lettuce which was basically soaking wet and who eats wet lettuce right?  The only thing good was the Cheese Toast and Frozen Yogurt. Avoid the salad bar folks."}
{"text":"Ordered fish & chips......steamed broccoli was cold.  (wouldn't melt butter) Fish was under cooked. Chatted w/manager. Comped me my next lunch. This was the first time I have ordered food from the kitchen. On the flip side, the salad bar is wonderful! The cold is cold, the hot is hot. Constant attention is given to cleanliness & freshness. Try the fried chicken wings, and ask your server for an order of cheese toast. Yummy"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for half salad bar, half sit-down, this is the restaurant for you! It was clean, the prices were average and the food was OK."}
{"text":"Yes, SIZZLER.  And it's A-OK!  (3 stars)    I rediscovered Sizzler about a year ago when I started noticing coupons coming in the junk mail every so often.  So one day I decided to give it a try as I haven't been to one since a bad experience at the Flagstaff Sizzler over 15 years ago.    What I like: The salad bar is well stocked with a fresh, diverse selection of salad items, desserts, and other items.   I really like the fresh avocado slices and call me simple, I like the basic, non-designer coleslaw.   In addition the mini taco bar is a nice touch and I appreciate the refried beans being clearly marked as vegetarian.   Dinner Toast is great.  I want some right now. Service is very good.  All the staff are friendly and helpful. The place is kept clean thanks to the great staff.   Needs Improvement: The ice cream yogurt is of low quality.  It comes out crystalizey.   The quality of the non fresh items is low.  The melted cheese, pudding, soup, and anything saucy is generally overly starchy.  It doesn't look good and textures are just a bit off.  Taste is alright.   Some of the other desserts get dried out, like the pound cake.  Besides the salad bar, if you are a vegetarian, the only dinner option is the Fettuccine Alfredo.  Sadly this is of school cafeteria or tv dinner quality.  Taste is bland and it looses its creamy texture quite fast.    This place will stay on my once every 6-8 month places.  It's good for salad and a few extras and even better when you have a coupon."}
{"text":"This place is Awsome!! Great food, clean n great staff!! Keep up the great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the staff what can I say it's Sizzler! Everything you love and remember from your childhood can be relived, come in and reminisce.  It's still awesome.  Make sure you say hi to Penny and Amber while your there they are the spokes that keep this wheel turnin."}
{"text":"Sizzler in general is a bit dumpier than it used to be, but the staff is friendly and you get a ton of food for the money. Their salad bar is extensive and the food is fresh. Get the Malibu chicken. It's a childhood favorite and has stood the test of time. Whenever I'm traveling, I always check if there's a Sizzler nearby.  Visit Date: 11/19/09"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Waiter dropped off food and never came back! Didn't care if we needed anything. And other waiters/waitresses were waiting on other tables and not one came over to us. The chicken Alfredo was nasty. Sauce tastes old and left over. 8oz steak was more like a 3 oz steak. And a waitress was fighting with the cook. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"A very clean Restaurant. Friendly employees, a great salad bar, and great food and drink. One of the best Sizzlers around"}
{"text":"The food was great! Cooked to perfection and the salad bar was fresh and many choices! The cashier had fantastic customer service!  Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"The food was awful.  The salad bar had wilted lettuce. The steak had absolutely no taste. There is a Texas Roadhouse around the corner. Go there!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here who was wanting to try this place. I guess I was under the impression that this place was nicer than it was.  I only had the buffet which was probably a mistake since I wasn't feeling too good a couple of days after eating here.   Salad bars are usually pretty standard, and this one was no exception, other than their ingredients didn't taste very fresh.  Other than the actual salad on the bar there were no great options. Three kinds of chicken, rotini pasta and marinara sauce and make your own tacos.  The best part of this whole buffet was the small fresh fruit selection and desert."}
{"text":"DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY... Typical Sizzler fare, but worse. After waiting for somebody to show up to take our order, we were seated in a near-empty section of the restaurant. We should have known that there was a reason the restaurant was so empty on a Saturday evening. Although the selections were decent tasting, everything was running low, and it seemed that nobody was refilling anything. Then at the end of the meal, the real issue hit. FILTHY BATHROOMS!! My wife came back from the bathroom ashen-faced, stating that the women's room was filthy, smelly and hot (broken AC in Phoenix in the summer???). I decided to check out the men's room, and it was truly gross (SEE PICS). When I asked to speak to the manager, a young women came out, and clearly could not care less. No apology, no explanation, no offers, her only response- I'll get someone on it. PICTURES: http://imgur.com/a/IYlqW"}
{"text":"Best deal on steak ever. Ribs too. Huge selection on the salad food bar. Staff was really nice."}
{"text":"This place was filthy!!  We ate at a Sizzlers in Cottonwood, AZ 2 days before, and we liked it soo much we decided to look for one close to our Phoenix hotel. Since there are only 2 Sizzlers in Phoenix, we picked this one and arrived  aroung 6.30 pm. We entered this place and were kind of welcomed by a grumpy manager( that should have been a sign), placed our order, and looked for a clean table. We found 1 in a corner, the rest wasn't cleaned. We took our plastic!!!! plates, and went to the salad-bar. Several trays were empty, and were not refilled. The fries were cold, there was food everywhere on the floor. I ate my steak, which was ok, my wife didn't eat anything, i drank my Coke(no refills??!!), asked for the bill, and went to the bathroom. Oh my God.......no words for this experience. Never again in this dump.  They should go to Cottonwood to learn how to run a restaurant in a proper way."}
{"text":"Wow it was everything I remembered! The steak was cooked perfectly and the ultimate shrimp platter was delicious...the salad bar was fresh and well stocked and the frozen yogurt was just as remembered. It was clean not outdated at all and very affordable. The service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was the nicest Sizzler I've been to. We were visiting Phoenix and didn't know the neighborhood so was pleasantly surprised.... Lots of salad choices, yum banana pudding. Very clean and spacious.friendly staff."}
{"text":"They should call it all the shrimp we ain't never gonna give because they will give you six small and you will never that server again except to give you an excuse as to why you haven't received your food.  Themanager's response......don't order that anymore! I just won't ever go to a Sizzler anymore, how about that manager?"}
{"text":"Was running errands with my GF yesterday and decided to stop here for lunch since we love the salad bar, especially with the senior citizens price.  I had forgotten that Sizzlers advertises menudo on the weekends, so I was pleasantly surprised with the offering this Saturday.  The menudo was pretty darn good -- not the best I have ever had, but very good.  It had enough tripe and hominy (in fact too much), but it did not have any cow hooves or shank/ankles, but still tasted pretty good.  As condiments, they had chopped onions and cilantro, but they should have had Mexican oregano and crushed red peppers to round out the condiments.  But all-in-all, it was very good and with the salad bar, it was freaking great!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, ordered a rib eye steak, one of there most expensive through grub hub I called after my order was confirmed to make sure they sent a particular sauce with  the steak because in the pass when I added this in the notes the sauce would not arrive with the steak. When I called I reached Amber, who I was told was a manager, she said she would be happy to send the sauce. When the food arrived there was no sauce I called the restaurant and asked to speak to Amber who  told me very rudely that the reason  she forgot  the sauce was because they were busy. She offered to give me the number to grub hub customer service. Of course this would do nothing for this dry 22 dollar steak in front of me. I suggest if you want something from this particular Sizzler and Amber is working don't use grub hub because Amber might be too busy to get your order right"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave them 2stars is for food ONLY! Customer service is bad. The tables are sticky. Its warm inside. The restroom is worse of all. It is atleast 90° in there. The toilets and floors are dirty."}
{"text":"Poor customer service tonight at the location in Phoenix-Metro Center. I asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp. The waiter said I couldn't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited.   I replied and said well that is nice to know but it would be nice to have consistency because it has not been a problem the last few months.  We generally enjoy Sizzlers on a monthly basis and the waiter rather than let it goes wants to argue about policy, how other employees weren't doing their jobs and could be reprimanded for letting me take home the almighty shrimp.  The whole time the lazy manager observes this and does nothing. He doesn't intervene but rather let's a waiter argue with a customer.  We have been frequenting this Sizzlers since 1998 and now just because you would rather throw away 10 pieces of shrimp rather than let the customer enjoy them at home with the expectation that next time we wouldn't be able to take the shrimp home you instead lose a loyal a  customer.  Texas Roadhouse, Black Angus and Longhorn's just up the street I am sure will appreciate our frequent visits.  To the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp!"}
{"text":"Well this is my first time in an Arizona Sizzler.  I remember being a child and going with my family in Northern California and it was the best!!!! The shrimp was good, steak ok, but it's HOTT in here so they call it Sizzler now because of my forehead??? Can be easily improved."}

{"text":"Stopped in several times over this past month.  Was volunteering/enjoying the Arizona State Fair and looking for a healthier dinner option than deep-fried fair food or nearby fast food.  This location was very clean and had helpful/courteous employees helping at the counter and serving tables.  The salad bar was great with soups and some hot food selections as well.  In our party a couple of us just got the salad bar and one other got steaks on our visits.  Would definitely recommend this Sizzler.  Large indoor dining area with long tables perfect for larger groups.  Several smaller more intimate booths and tables as well.  Staff was very accommodating and sang Happy Birthday to my wife on our visit for her birthday this past month.  At least two corner mounted televisions are there for sporting events.  They had college football on one time and a World Series game another night.  The Strawberry Lemonade served in an over-sized Mason jar is amazing.  Looking forward to returning to this location."}
{"text":"Got a tri-tip steak and unlimited salad bar. The steak was ok, it was somewhat overcooked (ordered medium rare) but the seasoning was quite good - the flavor was there, but not quite cooked to my liking. Steak aside, the service was phenomenal! Our server was on point, visiting us whenever she saw a low drink or an empty plate on the table. The salad bar was also quite good. Probably my favorite part! There were tons of options, wings, tacos, pretty much any vegetable, and the ranch was damn good. I think next time I'll just go for the salad bar. At $10 all you can eat, you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to try this place due to some reviews,however was nicely surprised with opposite. Stopped by for a family Sunday lunch and had a great time.Salad bar was fresh with a lot of options,even 3 choices of soup,desserts and choices of meat for your salad.Food we ordered arrived very fast(good size portions) and steak was especially delicious,cooked just as ordered. Staff was polite as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Christmas Dinner.  I'm giving this location 5-stars for being a shining light on Christmas night 2015. Bravo to the employees who sacrificed time with their own families to provide a hot meal to weary travelers who unexpectedly found themselves adrift for a meal. Kudos. Kudos. I hope they got extra pay for working the holiday.  At 8pm the place was packed. So we weren't the only ones seeking a meal on Christmas night.  We traveled 370 miles to Phoenix never thinking about dinner and that so many places would be closed because of the holiday, but we quickly found out different. And Phoenix is a dark town when business lights go out. Even the restaurant at our hotel was closed for Christmas.  We consulted Siri by cellphone to find the location. As we approached the building, lights ablaze, bodies moving around inside. Hope. Stomachs growling. 8pm we parked hoping they were still serving Malibu Chicken and Grilled Salmon and were not about to close for the night. Hallelujah! This location is miles from the freeway and we would never have found it without Siri's help.  The salad bar was clean and appetizing. Food served hot and yummy. Rolls warm and toasty in their basket. And even though the temperature sank to the low 30s after dark a steady flow of diners used the self-serve ice cream machine.   A nourishing hot meal. Christmas music. Attentive service. What more could two grateful diners ask for on Christmas night.  Thank you, thank you, Sizzler staff for being a shining light on a cold winters night."}
{"text":"Let me just start this off by saying, my mom doesn't get out much. She's typically at home watching my son while I work all the time and tonight I thought it'd be great to take her out to dinner. She mentioned sizzler as something she hasn't had in a long time and how great it was and blah blah blah...so I said ok let's go there! Big mistake.   First off, dude behind the counter was all kinds of rude, not really answering our questions (I'd never been to a sizzler before and wasn't sure how the whole layout was) and just lame and uncourteous... Like come on bro, just fake it till your shift is over. We order and find a table and all is good. Daniel was a cool dude and took care of our drinks an what not. Brought us rolls... We hit up the salad bar and dug in. Then sit down to find That the salad dressing was gross-didn't taste like it was supposed . The avacados were gross. Beets were nasty. Spinach was funky. Nothing was working. And then the food came- UGH! We ordered our steaks medium, they were well done. My mom ordered the lobster with her steak, it was chewy and the butter was too salty. Her potato was burnt and dry. Her entire meal was horrible. My food was ok minus the salad. So we let Daniel know about my moms experience and he calls on his manager Penny, that lady was not pleasant from the get go, clearly did not like being summoned to take care of this matter and practically threw my moms money for her meal and left. I felt bad! My mom was hungry an my son was chowing down so we sat there, I let my mom try my potato and steak for comparison and apparently Miss Penny did not like that. My mom stepped out. And my son and I sat there and continued to eat(clearly giving refunds for shitty food is such an ordeal, we didn't want to have to deal with it again) and I left. Unhappy and unsatisfied. Daniel was cool tho."}
{"text":"We love their salad bar! There are so many fresh toppings to choose from you can't go wrong lol and Also love how they always have sliced avocados as that is my favorite topping!"}
{"text":"I was in this part of Mesa for a meeting and remembered Rand's positive review of the soup and salad bar. So I headed in with a coupon from Sunday's paper for the endless salad bar for just $5.99 (usually $8.49 or $7.99 for seniors).   I had a large salad, cottage cheese (Rand is right it is excellent), a potato wedge with green onion and cheddar cheese, a strawberry shortcake shooter, and some broccoli cheddar cheese soup with some of the cheesy Texas toast. It was all very good. The salad bar was kept clean, staff cleaned tables until they gleamed and the veggies in the salad bar were all fresh and crisp. I did not try the taco bar, the pasta, nor the desert bar.   All of the staff were friendly, the decor was timber, stone and hunter green accents. Parking is plentiful and close to the door. If you are looking for soup and salad this is an OK choice."}
{"text":"Sizzler happens to be one of my husbands favorite restaurants.  At this location there were some positive things, such as the salad bar which was typical, and good.  There are enough options there to satisfy most.   My husband ordered  the Steak and Colloso (sp) shrimp, and the food overall was good.  I got the special, which was Salmon.  The rice and brocolli was fine.   One very bright spot was one of the wait staff.  I did not get her name, however, she is African American and projected so much positive energy in her mannerisms, she should be your model of who to hire.   On the other side, there were some minuses.  First the bread at Sizzler is one of the best parts of the meal.  The cheesy Texas Toast bread.  Not so here.  The bread was not seasoned properly and was not good.   Second, the Salmon, was not edible.  I took one bite and could not take another.  I believe it was spoiled.   Third, the sauce that came with the Shrimp tasted like burnt oil.    One final issue was a very large party of individuals (my guess is 20), that was allowed to sit in the main room.  It is disruptive to have large groups, with a lot of small children sitting among  other guests.  Perhaps you should have more than 1 room for large groups, or in this case, ask the smaller party (we were the only ones), if we would have like to be reseated somewhere else.     All and all, this Sizzler does not rate high on my list."}
{"text":"The customer service was great. I ordered the shrimp scampi which was quite delightful. The waitress Bernice was welcoming and was a good server. Overall, this place was good but just not enough foot traffic you would thought there would be.."}
{"text":"Sizzler is consistently good for an average steak dinner. The salad bar is fantastic. The staff was very attentive and helpful.  We always enjoy our time there."}
{"text":"I see a lot of poor reviews and I'm really not sure why?  I've been coming to this location for a months now and I've never had a problem.  We used to go to the metro center location, which was not so good.  This place always has hot and fresh food on buffet and salad bar.  The staff is always polite and attentive.  The one thing I will say is that $15 per person seems like a bit much, but considering a combo meal at Jack In The Crack is $10, I'll pick Sizzler any day.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is what medium well looks like I suppose. Luckily I had not ate all day so I gagged through what I could. Do better... not an offer of a refund, a partial. Nothing."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for YEARS and went to come for dinner to see that it is closed down for good. I, my self was sad but my 5 year old was heart broken to see that he would not be seeing his favorite waitress Penny anymore. Hopefully we can find her at one of the other locations."}
{"text":"It's crazy to revisit a place that I worked at 20 years ago.  The best part was the Texas toast,  it's the same exact recipe they had when I worked here.  But make sure you ask for it because it doesn't automatically come work your meal.  Salad bar was good and clean today on father's day with 3 soups,  potato skins,  shredded pork,  ground beef,  ice cream machine, fruits, pudding and much more. The salad bar is a great value.   Steak and seafood prices are quite pricey, but for 2 senior meals and and a salad bar with drinks included we ate for under $30.  My dad enjoyed his lunch so we will be back."}
{"text":"30 something bucks for me and two kids.. meh  I had the steak which was a cheap cut but cooked perfectly. Decent sides of toast and baked potato. Not a bad meal for 9.99 with the salad bar, unless you remember that the place 'down under' serves a real steak and a great salad and bread for the same price.   Kids had salad bar, they were happy = free 'ahem' dessert."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very clean .  Service was exceptional.  Food was better than ever .  Salad bar is huge !"}
{"text":"Holy cow, when did good old Sizzler get so expensive!  The Steak and Lobster which used to be an affordable $14.99 is now $21.99!  Even the senior meals have gone up.  And the steak looked pretty tiny, even for $8.99 (see photo).  It was a tad chewy but did have real good flavor.  The broccoli was excellent, Texas Toast was good, Peach Lemonade was pretty sweet.  It was included with the meal but I would rather pay a dollar or two less and just drink water.  I don't drink much during meals.    I don't know why they make you pay up front when everything else is like a regular restaurant, server double checks your order, brings your food to you, checks back to see if everything is ok, refills your drink etc.  My server, Andrew, did an excellent job.    I thought it was a good idea to have people cut into their steak when it arrives to make sure it is cooked the way they like.  That probably saves problems later like people taking advantage by eating part of a steak and then saying it isn't done right.  Mine was perfectly cooked for medium rare.  The broccoli was cooked perfectly.  I could taste salt on everything though.  I noticed alot of overweight people eating there, probably because of the all you can eat salad bar.  I felt like I got a better deal money-wise at Golden Corral based on my last visit there but the Sizzler is close and convenient to motel."}
{"text":"I had not been to Sizzlers in about 20 years decided to try it for lunch.  I will never Go Back. On Sep 29 at 1:30pm. I ordered the salad Bar for myself and My Husband. It came to a total of 25.00$ my freind that came along ordered lobster and shrimp once she got her Lobster it was freezing cold she asked for it to be reheated it was never returned Back To Her. The salad Bar presentation was nice but the quality of the food was rubbery and tasteless. The chicken wings taste like wood. Disgusting for 25$ don't waste your money at this location. I expressed to the manager how disgusting the food was He acted like he really dint care he did not even say sorry. Our server was the only pleasant experience . Nasty and disgusting food. I will tell everyone I know to never eat there or waste there money."}
{"text":"I've made this part of my regular lunch rotation and as such it has earned a fourth star.  The food at the salad bar is always fresh, most times they even have avocados.  The service is always efficient and friendly.  Only a couple of changes have occurred since I started going here.  The most notable just happened recently.  They changed some of the items on the $3.99 express lunch menu (you can still ask for the grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoes) and now if you want to add the salad and drink it bumps it to the same $9.99 as their regular lunch menu with salad and drink.  This gives you more options but at a cost.  Seems they were getting into fights with people who couldn't read the dine in only sign in large letters and wanted to pig on the salad bar and then get a to go box for the entree.  Even at $9.99 it still is a good lunch deal in my opinion.  One thing not advertised is if you are getting the salad bar you can choose not to get a side with your entree.  That works out well for somebody like me that cannot eat as much as I used to so I can have a decent sized salad, a bowl of soup and still have room for a bowl of ice cream.  Another trick: The ice cream bowls are really small to make a sundae so I grab a soup bowl. :)"}
{"text":"Not happy with their policy on taking your leftover food home. They want to take your food back to the kitchen and box it for you and then bring it back out to you. Umm that's GROSS!!! I understand that some people want to steal from the buffet but instead how bout having the servers box it for you at the table? Why take it away out of sight?  And when I refused to have my food taken to the back the manager yelled at me and said I can box my own food but first she had to clear the table of any plates and I was not allowed to return to the salad bar. What? I needed a box to go home. I was already to full for anything else. SMH. I won't return to this place again. This manager made me feel like I was a thief. Horrible experience and embarrassing."}
{"text":"Sizzler happens to be a favorite of my family which is why we went.  We live in the midwest and most if not all the Sizzler restaurants are gone so when we went to Phoenix, this was a place my husband and son wanted to go.  For $8 you can get all you want to eat off of the lunch buffet. There was a decent variety, left feeling full (some of my party more than others) and the server was friendly and attentive.  Would I rush to go back? No, but that's because I prefer to eat somewhere other than at a buffet.  For the money, it's a pretty decent value.  You can eat healthier for the same money you'd be paying at the fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Thought I would give it a try, it was close, and I have enjoyed Sizzler salad bars in the past. Service was excellent, but the food was inedible. I had the 6 oz steak and all I cared to eat shrimp. The steak was 6 oz of gristle, I really had to saw at it to cut it, and it tasted nasty. The server was kind enough to bring me another piece. I could barely cut it, it was so tough, and still tasted like an old shoe. Shrimp was slimy, salad bar was pretty poor quality. Sorry sizzler, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just bought a to-go order of their steak and Veggie platter with Texas toast.  The meat looked and tasted like a hamburger patty. I ordered a steak.  I know the difference between a steak and a ground beef patty. I've been going to this restaurant for years. Their prices go up but their food quality goes down. If your cutting corners to save money, Don't do it to your customers or your food. Hiding mushrooms on top of the \"steak\" doesn't make it steak. That's a real deceptive practice."}
{"text":"many years ago we use to go to this restaurant.   We visited it the other evening.  We found the good bland, not cooked as requested,  small portions on the steaks.  Our server Penny was the only redeeming aspect of our visit.  Too expensive and not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great alternative to the now defunct Sweet Tomatoes.  A huge unlimited salad bar with tons of choices and all very fresh. Also included is a choice of 3 different soups, tacos with all the fixin's, wings both hot and mild, and pasta and meat ball sauce too. Nice clean decor and good friendly help."}
{"text":"A great all you can eat salad bar with soup and tacos. Had the 7.99 special beef tips and rice.  Got plenty and it was good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got a little excited to go out to Sizzler! I mean, it's Sizzler! He ordered steak and unlimited shrimp and I got the salad bar. The steak was terribly over cooked for medium-rare. The owner of the restaurant came over when I informed the server. The owner seemed accommodating enough until he turned around and rolled his eyes as he walked away. He then sent the server over repeatedly to make sure we weren't sharing the bottomless shrimp. If you want to feel like you're in the cafeteria of lockdown with the warden monitoring your every bite, then this is your spot. Made us so uncomfortable, we didn't even eat the steak that was remade for fear they might have don't something to it. That was a waste of $40! And the salad bar was subpar."}
{"text":"The salad was good but the rest of the buffet food was pure garbage! The ice cream was soft serve and its hard to mess that up so that was also not bad. Oh and my raspberry lemonade was decent as well. Don't order the full buffet and order some steak or something is my suggestion. This was twice the price it should have been for how nasty most of the food was.Oh and one more thing. The women's bathroom was nasty! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Dirty, Dirty restrooms! Beware! When we told the manager she could careless! We have reported this to corporate and haven't heard back and it's been almost a month!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been. My boyfriend and I went here because he heard that lots of films shoot there. Needless to say, I don't understand why...  My boyfriend ordered a steak with unlimited shrimp. I ordered a steak with broccoli. Broccoli was undercooked and seemingly not fresh. My steak was tough and extremely fatty, which for a 6-8oz sucks. My boyfriend's was overcooked (well done for an order medium-rare), and he said the shrimp was just okay. We both had salads, which were alright. They also serve rolls, which is great...but they came after our meal.  Not to mention, you walk in and order at the front. Then you can make a salad or just go sit at your table. Then a waitress/waiter will come by to check on you and ask for drinks (other than water)... so confusing. So my boyfriend and I weren't sure if we were supposed to tip her (even though she didn't do anything except bring us the rolls), which is difficult for the couple who NEVER carries cash on them (mind you, we already paid up front).  I do NOT recommend this place if your life depended on it."}
{"text":"I went through the salad bar line and also had a bowl of soup.   I'm waiting for my dinner to arrive when all of a sudden a young woman at the buffet line screams. I got up to see the cause of the commotion and I saw a 1\" cockroach run down the buffet line. I immediately regretted my choice of restaurant.   I told the cashier what I saw and that I wanted a refund. They informed the manager. The manager had the food pulled off the buffet and issued me a refund. He apologized profusely, but what can you say ? Would you eat at a restaurant with a cockroach waltzing down the buffet line ?  BARF."}
{"text":"Horrible service the manager Bruce was rude. The food was ok. And the salad bar was empty. Waste of time and a waste of money. When given the owners number 480-368-9503 Wayne or John I got to talk to wayne which was just as rude as his staff. Just like TGI fridays you will soon be out of business."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch and was very surprised. I expected a \"chain restaurant\" experience but honestly was blown away.   Their restaurant at this location was extremely clean.   The salad bar was full, rotated, hot, & delicious.   I also ordered a steak from their menu which came out cooked as ordered and was pretty dang good for a place like this.   Not to mention, our waiter was courteous, polite, and quick.   Desert was good.   Overall, I will come back to this location and I will recommend this place to others.   Good eating!"}
{"text":"This place had great service! Unfortunately, I encountered a few problems here. My steak was a bit overcooked, thus tough. In their defense, however, the server did ask us to check our steaks and I had agreed it was fine. My lobster was cooked well but it hadn't been cleaned very well. The meal was fine otherwise, but I haven't eaten at Sizzler in several years and I can see that the serving size has decreased considerably. It was enough for me but probably not my husband. Fortunately, he got a plate that included unlimited shrimp. Something to keep in mind is that you cannot add a tip to your credit card at sizzler.  My other HUGE disappointment is that they no longer have the king crab, or any crab.I would give this restaurant another chance, but next time I will order my steak a little less done and bring cash for the tip."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Sizzler in years, and had the urge after moving for some salad. This was the only salad bar close and so I talked my reluctant fiance into going.  The service was super nice and attentive. (not annoying attentive mind you, he kept our drinks filled and made light conversation) The manager was nice as well, and everyone was helpful.   The food was constantly being rotated out with fresh food and everything was kept clean. I don't think there was a moment we were there that the staff wasn't cleaning something. It was great.   Only the bathrooms weren't the cleanest/nicest, definite wear and tear from the area.  The fruit was possibly the freshest and sweetest I've found all summer in particular the watermelon. Don't hate on Sizzler just because its corporate...this place has topped the service I've been receiving elsewhere as of late. So if you're in the mood for customer service, cheap prices and all you can eat I recommend that this Sizzler be your destination."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  I know it's been years since I've been here, but last I remember Sizzler was pretty much on par with Black Angus or close to it.  I know Sizzlers in California that are pretty decent.  This place.. wow.   My aunt and I had dinner here a few weeks ago.  When I first walked in, I was hit with that bathroom smell.  Mind you the bathrooms are right next to where you order.  Not a good placement. We opted for the salad bar and that's when I looked over at their \"buffet\" and it looked like nobody had cleaned it for half a day.  The food looked old, the lettuce wilted, it just looked gross.  After getting a few wings (plain because their buffalo sauce looked nasty), we sat down.   I had ordered a diet pepsi and a basket of bread.  The bread wasnt too bad.   Oh another note on the smells.. when we were walking from our table to the salad bar, it smelled like someone just urinated right on the carpet.   I said out loud \"why does it smell like piss in here?\"  Yes, hoping someone would hear me.  Nobody cared.  The service was ok and that's why it has 2 stars instead of 1.  Honestly, Sizzler looks like it's nearing the end of its run in Arizona.  There are three left and I believe this is the worst of them.   Some advice..  Fix this place up or do what Swensen's did and close the doors."}
{"text":"Just like home. The staff was very attentive and the Malibu Chicken rocks my socks off."}
{"text":"Wow, what a blast from the past!  I hadn't eaten at a Sizzler since it was popular in '80s, so when we saw that they opened up again where Taco Tote used to be, we had to go and check it out!  When we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp.  Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.  The salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.  The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.    Service was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.  One thing to note is that you cannot add tip to your receipt since you pay for your meal first, and then sit down, so cash will help for tipping your waiter!"}
{"text":"Wow, horrible food!!! I should have went to Denny's. I at least would have paid less.  I visited this establishment because my son won a coupon for reading many books.  Let me tell you, this was not a reward in hide site.  I tried the Broccoli Cheddar soup that seemed like I put a spoon full of nacho cheese in my mouth.  There was no broccoli.  I ordered the \"New\" Cajun Shrimp Pasta.  Yum, right??? NO!  First, this is not a sit down and order place.  I was not ready for that.  Once you enter you have to go up to the register and give them your order.  When I got my food there was nothing Cajun about it.  It was mastaccioli pasta with oil, a pinch of parmesan cheese, more oil, a teaspoon of alfredo sauce, with more oil.  The rolls that came with the meal tasted like plastic.  This was a waste of money and a wast of time.  My son had a coupon for a free child's dish and free was too much.  They should have paid me to eat it; which I couldn't.  I ate maybe 1/4 of my dish. Just enough to give this rave review.  Save yourself the heartburn and gas."}
{"text":"The Intalian herb chicken is amazing! Can't believe this is chicken breast! But the vegetables come with it are a little overcooked. And the unlimited salad bar is really nice"}
{"text":"Trash. Steak was small and over cooked, wings from the buffet were horrible some burnt and the service sucks. The manager kept sending the waitresses over to see if we were storing their cheap frozen shrimp in my target bag that had baby wipes and sippy cups for my toddler. And the manager looked mean and couldn't smile, I would never waste money there again. Not worth it. I don't understand why instead of refilling my water they were concerned if I was going to steal their nasty ass food. I don't even want to give them an star. Smh"}
{"text":"I know Sizzler is a chain. I know Sizzler is kind of trashy. No matter - I still love it!   I am a child of the 80s and celebrated special occasions at Sizzler growing up. My parents would take me and my sister when we got good grades, or when family came to visit us. I guess my affection is more nostalgic than anything, but this Mesa location still holds up!   I always get the Malibu chicken with a baked potato. It's tried and true, and hasn't changed since I was a kid (this is a good thing). You can ask for Texas Cheese Toast or Honey Biscuits at no extra charge. The salad bar is included, and offers taco items, chicken wings, and desserts, in addition to the usual vegetable fare.   The kid in me loves this place. It's no 5 star restaurant, but it makes me happy."}
{"text":"As a member of the loyalty club,  I received a complementary Malibu Chicken for my anniversary. Because I'm a heart patient I choose to eat at home so I called ahead of time and asked if I could get it to go, while informing the person on the phone, it states dine in. She said no problem we will make it to go. When I arrived no one new who I talked to and stated they were not making it to go so I requested to speak to manager and before I could explain to him what was going on he stated...\"the rules are the rules and it says it on the coupons in a rather rude way.  Thought food was great and server was a sweetheart...will not be going back to this location. It is very obvious I have a medical condition but was talked to in demeaning fashion...,."}
{"text":"The $8.99 salad bar-with-appetizers lunch is a huge win if your real goal is to eat a solid, pretty cheap lunch and you want some vegetables to make you feel good about what you're planning to do with taco shells, potato skins, and, later, dessert. The staff will help you feel good, as they are the sweetest people ever, and they deliver generous drink refills along with baskets of cheese toast.  If you're looking for fancy pre-made salads, the selection is smaller and less creative than at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes. If, like me, you're going with a few spinach or lettuce frills as a base for the good stuff, Sizzler has the edge of offering not just diced ham, not just pepperoni slices, but also diced bacon. There is also ambrosia salad, demonstrating a proper respect for the role of marshmallows in traditional salad-making (for real -- cookbooks of the 1950s love marshmallows and whipped cream in \"salad\").  The only soup (of the four) that I tried was the clam chowder: since it is the \"signature\" soup, it is available on a day other than Friday (say, Saturday!), which may make the case for this buffet right there. It's not going to send you into rhapsodies about the chowder you once ate in Boston or San Francisco, but it is recognizable and pleasant clam chowder that goes nicely with the cheese toast. Again, soup selection was less diverse than Sweet Tomatoes... but the trade-off for not getting Greek lemon soup or other more chi-chi delights is being able to have clam chowder on a non-Friday.  The appetizer bar, while small, blows past Sweet Tomatoes on the grounds of offering actual proteins (Sweet Tomatoes' spread looks splendidly chi-chi and healthful, then it dawns on you that it's a carb wallow) and past Souper Salad on grounds of offering... carnitas! Carnitas! I just met a scoop of carnitas! There are also flour tortillas deep-fried into cup shapes, and there is fresh guacamole that is definitely made with actual avocados. It is possible to construct a highly respectable Tex-Mex lunch.  There are also various forms of chicken parts (which I didn't try), potato skins (ditto), and pasta that can be draped with meatballs (which were pleasant, though not memorable). If you worked at it, you could probably manage a pasta in a salsa cream sauce, like at the chi-chi fusion restaurants... and on my next visit, I might.  The best part of Souper Salad, on a good day, is getting the gingerbread and slathering it with sundae toppings. Sizzler goes more for poundcake -- it also has mini desserts and soft serve -- and promises the exotic addition of pineapple topping. I need to go here on a day when I'm utterly starving, as there is much to explore, now that I have the lay of the land.  This is a four-star rating on the basis of being good at being a budget-ish buffet lunch, so if you're looking for organic greens and the finest ingredients, Sizzler's not a hidden Maryvale treasure. It's better-than-fast-food at a fast food price, plus everything's labeled with any common food allergy triggers (so you may not be able to eat everything, but at least you won't break out in horrible symptoms), and my delightful server brought me a to-go cup for the remainder of my iced tea (gratefully accepted, since I was taking the bus)."}
{"text":"Great place to eat your favorite seafood.  Salad bar is always displaying the freshest toppings and be able to serve your own ice cream portion is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu."}
{"text":"I did not like coming here at all. I am not a big seafood fan but I came here for the steak and all I could smell is the seafood. IT was horibble. The place was dirty and dingy. It took a great deal of my husband asking me to just try it for me too and i hated it!"}
{"text":"Just had the salad bar and it is incredible! Better than the other 2 popular salad places by far. They even have buffalo wings! The hot rolls and honey butter they serve with your meal is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is the only Sizz in the immediate vicinity.  I was telling my wife a few days ago that I hadn't been to a Sizzler in a few years and it was high time that we went to one in the Valley.  Today, we did.  Good steak, nice shrimp, not so good salad.  In a lot of ways, this Sizzler is kind of like getting Black Angus and Sweet Tomatoes rolled into one, only that it's a step down from Black Angus and two steps down from Sweet Tomatoes.  Overall though, we had a really nice meal.  The holiday sale of steak and lobster was really nice for my wife, and the \"endless shrimp\" with a steak filled me up nicely.  The salad just didn't do it for me--something about the taste was bland, but I don't go to the Sizz to graze on salad.  For me, it's all about the meat, the seafood, and the. . .  Cheese toast!  Yes, this old favorite of mine going back to the 1970s is still here, and still as good as ever.  You don't get the old fashioned plates with the wood underplate and the metal main plate any more, but you still get the same reliable Sizzler steak taste at a reasonable price.  Yes, there are better places to get a slab of meat, but Sizzler will always hold a special place in my heart for a decent steak and fixins with the family.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"After the class, we were all hungry so they took me to Sizzler. I had never had Sizzler before, but looking at their menu, I knew it wasn't gonna be healthy. I was originally going to order a burger, but that didn't make the most sense with the health kick I was going for so I stuck with what Steve and Chris got: the Endless Salad Bar. I figure salad, with everything in smaller proportions than I would normally have it (I took a quarter ladle of ranch dressing and a small spoonful of potato salad, for example), I could eat healthier on this 4th of July weekend. I dunno. I wasn't that impressed with the place. Senior citizens abound and strange music coming from the PA system. When I went to the taco bar, there wasn't much in terms of choices. The meat was hotter than I would have liked, the guacamole was flat and bland (I've been on a guac kick lately), and honestly, the tacos didn't impress. The brownies I got were dry and bland as well. Just as good, I guess, since all three of us were trying to watch our figures. I dunno if it was worth paying nearly ten bucks for that kind of meal. I liked that the server guy was helpful by clearing the empty plates and refilling the drinks, but not invasive or in the way like some servers usually are at places like this."}
{"text":"I've been to sizzler many of times and I will admit this is the first bad experience I have had with it. My Fiancé and I decided to go for dinner which we rarely due anymore. He got the chicken and I got the 6oz steak, well when the steak arrived and I took a bite it was extremely chewy. I literally couldn't eat it because of how chewy it was. My fiancé tried a bite and he told me I should let them know. I told the waitress and she got the manager, she told me she could refund me for the steak but nothing else as I had already ate from the salad bar. I told her I understand that. I got refunded 3 dollars! Just my meal alone was 17 dollars you're telling me that the salad bar and my drink was 14 dollars? That's the same price as my fiancé's meal. Not to mention the salad bar isn't that good. I don't think I will be going back to this location. My advice, spend 10 dollars more and go to Black Angus for their camp fire meal it's at least worth it."}
{"text":"I had riblets, baked potato & salad bar. The riblets are awesome. They also had salted caramel cheesecake shooters that were fabulous  Hubby had steak & all you can eat shrimp. He got a great size steak and more shrimp than he could eat!  We will be back"}
{"text":"Two salad bars, and a hamburger for my girlfriends kid and two Dr Peppers. $44. Really?  $12.99 for a hamburger... C'mon!  That's a bit excessive.   The bathrooms were disgusting. No lie I wanted to throw up the food I just ate.  The cheese toast I remembered as a kid is what brought me here.  It's thinner.  4 stars for the cheese toast."}
{"text":"Ahhh I've been going to this place since I was a wee little girl. And it is clear there hasn't been much done with renovations over 20 years later... annnndd the taste is very consistent and brings a feeling of nostalgia. That's probably keeps this place from being a 2 star. :) I've always been a fan of the buffet: seafood salad, fried chicken wings, taco station, and soup station. The only reason why I don't order just buffet is that you can pay essentially $4 more and have the entree.... and then take the entree home as leftovers.   Bathrooms are nasty.  Food is wonderfully average. Solid. Nothing bad, but nothing astounding. It's just perfectly edible."}
{"text":"Awful, food sits and is old. Soups are cold, chicken is old, salad dressings have other stuff floating in them. Service is awful and no one cares when you tell them"}
{"text":"Well its been a long time since we had visited a Sizzler and I hope to never make the mistake of going to one again. $42 for two  6 oz steaks 1 salad bar.   The steaks taste as though they were saved from the dog food processing plant. Absolute NO seasoning on the nasty meat. Crappy buffet. at the very best it should have been under $15 for it all.   To top it off the waitresses know the food is bad and just don't care that you say so. You will be better off buying your own steaks and microwaving them to death they would be much better than these. Luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food. Just ask them."}
{"text":"Food here was great, especially the salad bar area.  It had some pretty good food other than the salad (taco bar, wings, soups, etc).  It's almost like a mini Golden Corral, but way cheaper.  If you do get an order of food from the menu be prepared to eat a ton since the portions here along with the salad bar are more than enough.  That being said, it was super clean and the server was attentive and checked on our drinks often."}
{"text":"Went to Sizzler for the first time in at least 10 years. My expectations were not high, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't know how many hot items would be at the buffet, so I ordered an entrée + the salad bar. Got the Malibu Chicken (which is like Chicken Cordon Bleu), a piece of breaded chicken with ham and Swiss cheese on top, and fries. I really didn't need to get an entrée because there were plenty of items at the buffet. I got a little mac & cheese, pasta w/ meatballs, rice & carnitas. They also had soups, tortillas, beans, taco meat, chicken wings, potato skins... Our server offered us rolls or toast, but I declined since there was so much food already. They looked really good though! The mac & cheese was good, but cold the first round. Got some more later and it was hotter. The pasta w/ meatballs was also good, but the second meatball I got was still cold inside. The carnitas were very good. If I hadn't gotten an entrée I would've made a burrito. I liked the Malibu Chicken, although Swiss is never my first choice for cheese. It was a small portion, which I appreciated. The fries were battered and good. Good iced tea too! Our server forgot about our drink refills for awhile, but she was very nice. For dessert I got a salted caramel cheesecake shooter, which was like mousse. It was yummy! Also got some pound cake with strawberries, whipped cream, and a little chocolate sauce. Mmm mm! The dining area looked very clean too. We will definitely be back! Want to try that bread next time..."}
{"text":"I'm super pissed off about my experience today. To start, they gave my daughter a dirty glass! Looked like it had butter in it or something. They gave her a Styrofoam cup and I let that slide. Then the most disrespectful thing occured. My glass was empty for a while and just had ice in it after I finished my lemonade. When the waitress  finally came by she asked \"what are you drinking ma'am, water?\" I said \"no its lemonade\". Her tone change, she was looking at my glass and she said \"lemonade?\" And I said \"yes lemonade.\" I thought that was strange but I didn't say anything further. She came back with another glass of lemonade and I said \"thank you.\" However, as she was walking off with my empty glass she proceeded to shake my glass trying to look through the ice to check if I was lying about what I was drinking! I could not believe that she was doing this! I immediately got a manager but all he did was apologize and give me $10 off for next time! I am so disgusted with this place they can take that insulting coupon and.... well you know! Anyway, I will never be visiting that place again! S/N I know she would not have been looking through my glass if I weren't for the fact that I'm black! However little does she know, I am a business owner and am working on my doctorate degree and I don't need to steal no damn lemonade!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Sizzler in a long time. This review is for the Salad Bar only. The salad was fresh and ample variety of fixins. The hot dishes, chicken was dry...too long sitting out, not one single piece was eatable. Skimpy on the soups and tacos.  Overall at best 2.5 stars....."}
{"text":"I don't give a damn what anyone else has to say, we LOVE Sizzler!!! Their salad bar is HUGE and includes everything that I love on my salad, including fresh cut boiled eggs and REAL bacon chunks!! They have lots of FRESH chunks of fruit and soooooo much more!!!  They have a taco bar with a variety of fresh salsas and sour cream, and you have your choice of tortillas or hard shells. Fill them with super flavorful pork roast that you shred yourself from the whole roast or add ground beef, beans and Spanish rice too!!! They have TWO types of yummy chicken wings, either hot wings or barbeque and both are delicious!!   They have spaghetti with MEATBALLS, yes, REAL meatballs!! You serve yourself spaghetti and then toss some sauce and meatballs on top!! You can also choose a half of baked potato with cheese and bacon!! They have FOUR home style soups daily!!! They also have a selection of deserts!!!  There is so much to choose from, I can't remember it all!!!   OKAY...the salad bar is less than $10.00 for lunch and a couple bucks more for dinner. You can add a meal for just a few bucks more!! I like their butterfly shrimp!! Hubby usually orders a steak and chicken. Our kid loves the popcorn shrimp and there is nothing \"popcorn\" about it!! They are big full sized shrimp!!  You don't have to order a salad bar. Their meals are tasty!! The steak and chicken both have smokey flavor and are super tender and typically cooked perfectly (if not, send it back with no problem)!! Oh ya, they serve SUPER FRESH super tasty rolls with your salad bar or meal!!!  Yes, this place is a bit dated, but I don't go to Sizzler because its eye candy. In case you don't notice, the entire area is dated, so it fits in just right. I go because the food is great for the price we pay! The VALUE is incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Really good selection to choose from on the salad bar. Everyone in our party enjoyed the food and service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Clean, food was fresh but baked potato was a little over cooked. The server was very nice, I wish I could remember her name."}
{"text":"I was actually a little surprised how much I enjoyed my visit here. Staff were very friendly and attentive, and the food was better than I expected. There are a few surprises too, like a mini taco bar with some pretty tasty pork meat and cheese sause, fresh halved avacado that you can eat by the plate full, and all the other little things you'd expect from a salad bar."}
{"text":"We came here because we had a buy one get one free coupon. The entire staff was very friendly. I noticed a lot of complaints on the customer service- maybe they took them to heart. Cashier was great, waiter was great. Salad bar was awesome. Everything you could want and it looked and tasted fresh. Their bleu cheese dressing was fabulous and they even had crumbles to put on top! We definitely left with full stomachs.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars: the decor is very dated. Like it hasn't been updated since 1970. Also, it's a little pricey. Not sure if I would go without a coupon. Luckily the coupons seem fairly easy to find :)"}
{"text":"Great service and everything tasted great. Salad bar selections were fresh and plentiful. The entire staff was friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back very soon! Two words - CHEESE BREAD!"}
{"text":"It had been so long since I've been to a Sizzler... We walked in and were greeted by the manager and he was so very helpful and kind enough to take us through the menu. I had to have the steak & all you can eat shrimp. I've been all about that dish since I was a kid. It was the biggest treat for me growing up & it's probably why I get so hyped to order it to this day. I got my steak medium and it was good. It was great with some A1 Sauce... The breaded shrimp was good stuff! Just as good as I remember it. I re-upped once and only once. I was so full after having that meal and the salad bar prior to the steak & shrimp. My salad was heavy on the 1000 island, bacon crumbs & croutons. Probably the unhealthiest salad ever assembled but it was very tasty... And we cant forget about the cheese bread. Nothing takes me back to being a kid more than enjoying some of Sizzler's cheese bread. But one secret I learned only a few years ago with seniors that I worked with who are regulars at Sizzler was to request to have the cheese bread toasted on BOTH sides. Whhhaattt?!?!? That's right... BOF sides!! My knowledge is your gain.. Enjoy. And dont forget to come back and thank me for that tasty nugget.  Thank you Sizzler!!  ps - I had soft serve on a cone to end the meal. And yes, I indulged in the oreo cookie crumbs they made available. So good..."}
{"text":"So here I sit, enjoying my steak and lobster with a side salad from the salad bar. I clearly have not finished my entire meal, which included a single salad trip, when I ask for a box. The waitress asks if she can box my food.  I said no thanks, I can do it.  She states I will not be able to take my salad with me.  She states she must throw it away.  When I ask why, she states it's the rules. I ask to speak to the manager.  He promptly comes to my table and asks if there is a problem with my salad.   No, I reply, I would like to take it with the rest of my meal.  \"Oh, we don't allow that, you must finish it.\" \"WHAT?! You would throw away food even if the customer wants it, paid for it, clearly didn't refill a large fresh salad, and does not want to waste it.\"  \"Yes, that's exactly right,  what's to prevent someone for filling up on other items and taking an 'unlimited' item home in a box.\"  Seriously, you have got to be kidding me.  I ate half of all my paid for items.  Did not eat their bread, rolls or any other item on the 'unlimited' salad bar, and I can't get a doggy bag til I relinquish my salad.  Only to have it thrown away.  And this, the manager claimed, is the owners rule.    Well I will sit here for hours, annoying the Hell  out of them, I may even call the authorities, since this place is clearly holding the food I PAID FOR hostage."}
{"text":"I always come here. Its my usual \"go to\" restaurant for special occasions. I love the food and the service.  This time the service sucks. The waitress is just rude. She wont smile at us and just looks generally annoyed with us. Plus she took longer than usual to get the food. (we saw her talking to another girl) so our food wasn't hot hot and kinda dry.  I don't know what that is about. It just makes the atmosphere kinda crappy.. She was polite to everyone else, just not us.   UPDATE: we waited for a while for refills and boxes. Like 25 minutes. Finally i had to go up to the front where they keep the drinks and had to ask for one. I asked for a box and this guy (maybe the manager?) said that he would make sure the waiter would come give us a box. She didn't come for about 10 more minutes even though we saw her walking around checking on everyone else and in the corner talking. FINALLY she brought us a box and a cup(not even a \"have a nice day\" or a smile) and walked away.  Before all this, i always gave this restaurant 5 stars. Right now i dont think they even deserve 2 stars but i am polite. As much as i love this place, i don't think i will be coming back for a while..  Update #2 The woman that I wrote about in the last edit officially ruined this whole place for me. She was even more rude than she was, called me needy because I asked for a napkin and then told me she hopes I wouldn't come back because she didn't like to serve \"my kind\" ugh!!  If your curious, her name is Lauren. She has glasses and a bad attitude."}
{"text":"This was our first visit at this location and our first visit to a Sizzler in years. The dining room was clean but the bathrooms not so much. Our ordering went fine and the service once we sat down was great. Hubby ordered steak and endless shrimp and they were happy to bring him more. I had steak and veggies. The steak was flavored good and cooked well. It was a little fatty for a sirloin but other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Sizzler is the best place! Food and service, was the best! penny was our server, never had to ask for anything!Keep it up Sizzler!!!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly but the food was not worth the money. Fried shrimp was over cooked. Streak was cheap and tough to chew. Best part of the food was the soft serve ice cream. This was my first and last visit to sizzlers."}
{"text":"Great value got combo and ice tea  Fast and great service clean atmoshere I enjoyed.... Visit again."}
{"text":"The steak was actually good, but the fried shrimp was kind of below the average. The salad buffet was just fine, sweet tomatoes is definitely better, but I may miss the fried wings and tacos!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent when you desperately NEED a steak and don't want to make it yourself . Mainly because you just volunteered all day in the 5th grade class and mowed an acre and a half.  Admittedly, the service has always been the REAL reason we go. I've yet to meet a surly servers there and that's pretty darn amazing if you think about it!  Oh and hubs and kidlet (10 y\o) dig on the mammoth salad/nacho/dessert bar.  Me, uhhhhh.... I'll take the steak, medium rare with the cheesy bread and call it a day.  OH YEAH!! BRING YOUR OWN SPLENDA! It's a Pepsi (bleh) house, so, I drink iced tea and Sweet n' Low just don't cut it for this girl!"}
{"text":"Well where do I begin. My daughter and son in law took me out to dinner  ( I'm from the Bay Area) I love the Sizzler so here we go. Phoenix Arizona the Sizzler on Indian School Road It was around 8pm and bells went off we could park right in front wow. When we went in there was only 6 people there well I was glad we beat the rush. HaHa was the joke on us we ordered and sat by the salad bar. My Daughter and I went and got a salad and sat down we glanced over to the salad bar where two workers were cleaning the glass over the foodspraying cleaner and wiping over the food ! All the way around rubbing and dropping pieces of the paper towel in the food.  That was it for all of us we called the Manager who proceeded to say it was policy to wipe over the food. If this is what's going on in front what's going on in the back. Enter at your own risk, I'm sure there's plenty of room for those who dare."}
