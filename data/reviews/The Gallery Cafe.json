{"text":"Directly east of the AMEC building on 7th street is the Gallery Cafe. I'm a fan of this place for two reasons. Firstly, I like the food. It isn't complicated or fancy, but just really good. It's got that homemade taste that I love. Secondly, price. Had a beef penne with salad and garlic toast and it was $6.80. That's cheaper than a lot of downtown food courts!"}
{"text":"The Gallery Cafe has been in my path for quite some time on the west side of downtown.  I have been frequenting it a little more often lately, since I have recently discovered the esthetics salon beside it that shares a common doorway off 7th Street SW.  So to a certain extent, I have rediscovered it.

The gallery cafe has a large assortment of sandwiches, that come with either a salad or fries for under $6.  I kid you not.  

Further, I was watching them scoop out an insanely huge portion of homemade macaroni and cheese to the customer in front of me.  In my mind, that portion would have fed 2 - 4 people easy.

In the same visit, the special was perogies and cabbage rolls, and again, the portion was insane.  There were 3 large cabbage rolls that easily filled a third of the plate.  Then a stack of perogies.  They kept falling off, but the girl behind the counter was persistent about loading it up, and then another wedge on the plate with a salad.  It looked pretty good, but what really surprised me was the large poritions for little money.

As I approached the till to pay, there is a friendly sign over the cashier.  The sign lets you know that their meals are homemade and prepared with care and that they value comments and suggestions to help customers happy and healthy.  Who wouldn't want to support a business like that?  I know I do!"}

They have an awesome breakfast bagels and she makes fresh muffins these little mini Bananna loaves and these bacon stuffed cheese croissants. Everything else is really good to. Breakfast cost 5-7 dollars. They make you feel like a friend when you go in there. The regulars love them."}
