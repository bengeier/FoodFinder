{"text":"Food was very good. 
Ordered a beef soon tofu and cousin ordered a mushroom soon tofu. Tofu was smooth and soft. Raw Egg came on the side and soup was really good. Came with 4 side dishes,  Kimchi, fish pieces, Veges and bean sprouts. 

Best part was the rice, was purple healthy rice that came stone pot like Bibimbamp style. Was really hot but good cause there were the crunchy parts at the bottom. 

Service was kinda slow though, there was only two people working at the store, a chef and a waitress. There were only 2 tables, but it was a Sunday afternoon. Food took a good while to get to the table. But was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Super hot bowl = super hot food = me love.  

Temperature of the food is very important to me!  

The bowl used for the rice combo are REAL stone bowl (yes, there are fake ones) - since they really retain heat, hence can crisp up the rice!!!  

I will come back..."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a lunch on Thursday. It was our first time trying out Korean food here. When stepping in the restaurant, I really like its elegant decor and delightful ambiance with beautiful background music. Immediately, we were served to seat on a table for 4. After reading the menu for a while, we ordered one beef lunch combination and one seafood soon tufu soup. Impressively, our food came out so yummy and flavorful. I definitely would come back for trying out other items, especially the spicy pork bone soup..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  I ordered the dumpling tofu, and the dumplings were the best I've tasted and the tofu was soooo fresh!!!  The side dishes were different than what I've usually seen in a Korean restaurant, and I thought they were excellent.  Service was terrific as well, and I liked the way the food was presented.  I am definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered tofu soup with clam, beef, bushroom. I was very shocked at the meager portion of clam and beef given. In fact, there was exactly one small clam, and very little beef (two small finger size)). Basically it is just a tofu soup and it is just not worth the price (with tax over $10).  Compared with my consistent good experience with other korean restaurants in the past, it was a definitely let-down. I don't think I would ever come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on a weeknight, about 6.30pm. It was our first time and the place was empty, but after placing our order with the sole waiter, 10 others soon streamed in - elderly Korean folk, which was quite positive.

The food arrived quite quickly, the 5 side dishes were flavourful and fresh. The rice was really nice - purple, fragrant - it came with in a hot stone pot. So the rice texture was crispy to smooth and fluffy. 

We had the soon tofu (pork and seafood). The spicy version tasted quite good, but the \"mild\" version was lacking flavour. Overall, quite happy with this place and would recommend others to come.  

That said, my family (6ppl) visited there during a Sunday night (7pm), and generally enjoyed the experience, except that one of the orders was completely forgotten."}
{"text":"100th review! 

in honour of the Jennifer M Centennial review, I decided to review something close to my heart, tofu. I was really hoping for something special here, especially since its First Markham. 

Me, fresh from Hot Yoga, with SO and friend visited Sogong-Dong for one of my favorite foods ever, Soon Tofu. Since I have had Buk Chang and House of Soon, I guess that I have been spoiled (note to self update house of Soon review to full 5 stars http://www.yelp.ca/biz/tofu-village---house-of-soon-tofu-toronto#hrid:AhTwo4Heo5GkXvvuxaB5wQ/src:self) but I was expecting something delicious - especially since they have 3 mushroom soon here, but what killed the experience was the total lack of service. Worst. 

We walked in at about 4:00pm, and there were 2 occupied tables in the entire place. The server motions us to the ONLY TABLE in the ENTIRE RESTAURANT that is not completely covered in dishes, food, bunched napkins, half full water glasses. It looks like the place had just been evacuated. We sat down and waited. Although there were 4 employees present, no one was bussing the tables (and didn't until just before we left) or coming to us to take our order. Eventually one guy sauntered over, took our order and disappeared. 

Eventually he brought a pitcher of tea, which was never refilled even though we finished it quickly. 15 min later we got our side dishes which were embarrassingly sparse for a table of 3. Think, an ounce each. We later asked for refills, which he begrudgingly fetched for us.  Our food finally ready arrived and was decent, but when it came time to pay, again our server was MIA. I went to the cash, wading through a mess of dirty tables. Four employees stood near the cash chatting. 

Honestly, I want tea when I walk in the door. I don't want to wait 15 min and then not get refills. Also should side dishes not come out immediately? Should they not be refilled without us asking? Do I have to eat with hours worth of dirty tables around me?

What a nightmare. Food was OK, prices were OK. But House of Soon's happy servers and deliciou/ generous side dishes DESTROYED this place. I won't be back, i'm sticking to Bloor and Christie."}
{"text":"We love it. The soon Tofu is consistently good, we've been here about 10 times in the last 3 months for lunch. The service is spectacular- the same waiter every time. Too bad Jennifer hit a bad spot on service.

Were big fans."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is very slow.  The management is bad.  We waited for a long time to be seated even there were empty tables.  Only one waitress and one chef are working on Saturday lunch time.  We ordered a set lunch served with tofu soup.  I'm allergic to seafood.  Unfortunately, there were a shrimp and clam in the soup.  I asked if they can change to pork or beef soup for me since it doesn't say there are seafood in the soup on the menu. They insisted not to change it for me!  Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming in which unfortunately fell short. It is not terrible but all means but in my opinion is not as good as its rival Buk Chang Soon Tofu.

PROS:
- Pretty generous side dishes
- Really silky soft tofu
- Healthy purple grain rice served
- Friendly service

CONS:
- Expensive for portion served. $8.99 for all soon tofu across the board regardless of toppings, and even then there isn't much toppings when you order it. I think this compares to $7.56 for a soon tofu at Buk Chang. 
- Broth was not hot enough at all. I put an egg in and it did not cook... which was kinda a fail
- Broth not flavourful enough and spice level off. Regular spicy was mildly spicy. Mild spicy was not spicy.

Verdict: I think there are better options for Korean and soon tofu in this area."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and but some minor gripes...

Service was forgettable: our waitress brought plastic cups over and dropped on the floor, and proceeded to give it to us...  Mind you, we were literally the first group of customers in the store, so it's not like she's in a rush to go serve other tables! We ended up asking for an extra cup.

THE FOOD! 

Classic pork bone soup ($9.99) - super flavourful, I didn't find it as \"meaty\" as some other places but that's more luck of the draw sometimes. The broth was so good! You can't choose the spiciness level but the default was \"just right\" for someone who likes mild to medium. 

Soon tofu (seafood) - my friend enjoyed her bowl that came with a raw egg! It looked like there was a lot of stuff in it. The bowls kind of small, but with rice, it's adequate. 

Marinated pork (came as a combo with soon tofu for 16.99 on a weekend lunch) - juicy and delicious ... Wouldn't mind thinner strips but still, would eat again. 

We got purple rice to go with everything and enjoyed it all. There's four or five appetizers and salads. No potatoes :( 

Overall the food is good, but I can get better Korean within Markham for less, so I probably won't come back because the prices are kind of \"meh\" also.  (The above food was shared between three people and it was okay for lunch, though.) 

NOTE: Add $2 on certain dishes/combos if it's a weekend, or a weeknight."}
{"text":"Tofu House is one of my favourite restaurants in FMP and the best place for Korean tofu soup.  Staff is friendly and food arrives promptly.  I also enjoy their variety of complimentary side dishes."}
{"text":"Used to be really good, favourite place for me and my fianc√© to go to for Korean food but not anymore. Took out a lot of the extra side dishes and the service is terrible; this guy was yelling at ME for complaining that their rice pot was undercooked and soggy with \"no, this is the best rice\" and stormed away.

One of the worst dining experiences."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Have to ask a lot of times before the servers remembers anything. Had to wait for a table even thought there were empty seats around. Small portions. Kim chi tofu soup have NO kim chi?! Will not visit again. All of the soup taste the same."}
{"text":"While Tofu House offers high quality soon tofu, they are completely overshadowed by Buk Chang Dong which offers better and more soon tofu at a lower price. The regular soon tofus are smaller than BCD's at Tofu House, and if you order the bulgogi + soon tofu special, the portion size is shrunk even further for both (so you're not exactly getting a great deal). Overall, there aren't many good soon tofus in the GTA, so Tofu House still has decent business because they're better than most others."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here, definitely one of the more unique Korean shops in the area. If you like tradition Korean soup with rice and side dishes, this is the place for you!

Soup and rice all come in cast iron dishes, which is amazing as it keeps everything hot!! Side dishes come with your meal, and can get as much as you want!

Service was good, unfortunately there was only 1 waitress, making things very busy for her. Could have been better service if there was another waitress."}
{"text":"Food here is good, although the portions are small, extra extra appetizers cost $, and the service is not the best.

The restaurant is quite small, so if it gets busy, I think it would be hard to get a seat. But on a Saturday at 6 pm, we were fine. The restaurant did not even get full by 7 pm. Unfortunately, when we tried to order the pork bone soup, they said they were sold out...

I would rate the service as meh to average, for a Korean restaurant. The lunch menu is a couple dollars cheaper than the dinner one.

Beef bulgogi and assorted soon tofu soup combo, $16.99: we were told the combo included the assorted tofu soup (we had no choice of the others), beef bulgogi, and rice. The rice is a purpley one and came in a stone pot. The beef bulgogi came on a small stone plate, and was quite good. The tofu soup was very delicious. The tofu was silky and the broth was flavourful and not too spicy (we got mild).

Bi bim bap, $9.99: this was pretty good. Flavours were all on point and delicious. I noticed that the bean sprouts and spinach was essentially the ones used in the free appetizers, and the beef pieces were small bits of the beef bulgogi we had. It tasted good, but I guess we should have ordered another entree instead!

After we were done our appetizers, we asked if they would charge for a refill. The waitress said no, but any additional refill after that one would have a charge. I thought that normally these refills were unlimited? Especially since they don't give big portions in the first place.

I would definitely come back for the tofu soup. The super silky tofu made me want to have more - and usually I'm not crazy about tofu!!! And the pork bone soup being sold out made me think they're really known for it - so perhaps I would get that if I came back."}
{"text":"Their pictures on the wall and menu are EXTREMELY misleading.
i ordered the seafood tofu. $8
there was one shrimp, 1 mussel and 1 clam. WTFFF
i even confronted the waitress asking them if they missed a few shrimp clam etc in my soup. answer was no

the non spicy broth was tasteless.
i've been to many other tofu houses and this one is the worst.

save your money and go some other place please."}
{"text":"IMPRESSED! Best friend and I came here for a quick dinner after deciding we've already been to all of the 'good' Korean places in markham. When it comes to Korean food, we know what we like and we don't like and we were reluctant and skeptical, just because we are so used to the Korean food in ktown and not here. 

I ordered the dumpling and beef soon tofu soup and she ordered the kimchi soon tofu. We love soon tofu, especially from Buk Chang Dong Soon at yonge and finch, so this better compare. The food came out fairly fast, which is impressive, considering they only have two people working- one server and one cook. We also got a side salad as a side dish, which was meh. Just lettuce and soy sauce. The soon tofu was AMAZING. Piping hot with super soft tofu. Oh my gaaaah, I know tofu leads to brain damage but if it tastes like this... we have a problem. The soup was very flavourful and I LOVE breaking eggs into hot soup. The best part was the purple rice, which was very good. I loved it! I just wish the crispy rice wasn't stuck to the bottom of the bowl so I could actually eat it... hands down, crispy rice is the best. 

I definitely enjoyed my meal here and I'll be back for more if I want to stay in markham to eat Korean food for once. Not a bad choice at all!"}
{"text":"Decent Korean place for hot and steamy tofu soup. Rice in stone pot was cooked perfectly with lots of crunchy rice at the bottom! I ordered the green vege tofu soup and it tasted hearty and salt level was not over the roof like some other krn places. However starting apps weren't great and portions of the apps could have been bigger. Also I ordered medium spicy but my soup ended up being not spicy at all so I would recommend choosing the hot option if you like the spicy kick."}
{"text":"Eek, the food here is not at all what I remember it to be.

I came here a few years back and it was the best Soon Tofu I've had up to that point, but now it's not very good at all.

I got the original beef soon tofu because apparently they don't make the plain soon tofu spicy. So I asked the girl if I can choose the level of spice for the beef one and she told me it only comes in medium. This was weird because it gives you spice levels on menu's second page, but I didn't question it. My mom ordered the pork bone soup.

So our food comes out with stone pots filled with purple rice and it's usually really really good, but this time the rice was super duper soggy. Pretty disappointing. My soon tofu was pretty bland and not spicy at all. I think they needed to cook it for a bit longer because it was warm instead of bubbling molten lava hot when I got it. 

In retrospect I should have just ordered the seafood one, but I was kind of confused and taken aback that they didn't serve the regular one spicy so I derped and just ordered the first one on the menu.

My mom didn't really like her pork bone soup either. She said it wasn't very tasty and there was only two pieces of pork bone in it.

Their side dishes were: 
- Young Kimchi
- Heavily seasoned bean sprouts
- Fish cake
- Green Chinese veggies with all the water squeezed out of them

We've had plenty of Korean food and this place does not measure up. It's a shame that 'tofu house' is in their restaurant name because they don't really do it well... Buk Chang is definitely a lot better."}
{"text":"Good food but not so good service. I've been here a couple of times - hearty tofu soup & sizzling galbi can always erase my winter woes.  Although the food is good the service is not always the best. They definitely need to hire and train more wait staff."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out a new tofu place.  My friends and I always go to buk chang, but I noticed that this popped up on my yelp, so we decided to go here.

We went on a Thursday evening around 6:30 PM or so.  The place was absolutely empty ... That should've been a sign.

We both ordered the dumpling tofu stew; it came with a deep fried fish or a salad.  Being the \"adventurous\" person that I was, I ended up getting the deep fried fish.  Bad choice.  It wasn't that great.

The tofu stew?  Too much tofu, not enough stew.  I had the regular.. it didn't seem like it had enough spiciness to it.  I wish I got the hot.

Overall?  Not really worth it.  Not really that great.  Disappointed? Mm. yeah."}
{"text":"I agree with Rex F. and think they need more staff. I saw two people working the whole restaurant which includes the cook. The waitress was also doing the job of a cook. She was very nice and very hard working. I thought the service was pretty efficient for the amount of staff they had. 

One thing that really bothered me is that they were out of pork bone soup. This is on a Thursday afternoon. I thought pork bone soup is one of the best sellers in Korean restaurants. That's like walking into McDonald's and being told they don't have chicken nuggets. 

Tofu soup with Korean beef ribs combo $14.99 - the ribs were excellent. Not overly fatty like other places and really juicy and tender. The ribs also had a sweet honey taste to it which i liked. The soup was tasty and not overly salty. One shrimp and small clam in the soup with lots of tofu. Could have used a bit more soup though. Comes with a raw egg which you must crack into the soup. 

Tofu soup with Bibimbap combo $14.99 - nothing to really to point out with the bibimbap. On par with other Korean restaurants. 

Meals come with a salad like you would get at Japanese restaurants and the side dishes include: kimichii, fish cakes, glass noodle, bean sprouts and green veggie of some sort. I thought the side dishes were a bit lacking and very small in portion. They do refill the side dishes but I really didn't feel the need to eat more."}
{"text":"Oh gawd, wtf I found a bebe pellet in my soon tofu dish - but first starting from the beginning...   we walked in, sat down, ordered and 40 minutes later we were served a salad.  The salad was the saddest salad I've ever seen.  It was just a few pieces of frail lettuce with sauce on it.  The side dishes were not impressive, although my friend mentioned that they have served an entire small fish as a side dish before the place went downhill.

Overall, the food was not bad, although the portion sizes were quite small.  What threw me off was when I bit something hard and a little small white pellet fell out of my mouth.  We asked the waitress what this pellet was.  She goes into the kitchen, comes back and tells us in a matter-of-fact way that it was a bebe pellet, one of those toy guns.  She asked which dish it came from and I said I think it was from the soup and though she offered to bring me another soup.  I don't want to eat food that potentially has bebe pellets in it!  And why would there be bebe pellets in the food anyway?!  That's not even a natural thing to have in the kitchen.

I asked to have it taken off the bill.  My friend was willing to take the chance with his meal since we waited so long and were so hungry.  The waitress said she wasn't sure whether she could take it off the bill, and said she would check.  5 minutes later she continues to serve other people and continues to wipe down the other tables.  Holy shitcicles, if this happened in the US, this place would be shut down because customers would take this to court and probably claim that their baby could have died eating a bebe pellet.  Why is this place still open?  I would never go here again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about two years and the quality of the food has sadly gone downhill: 

- The tofu isn't consistently good
- Used to be a choice between a fish appetizer or salad, now it's salad only
- Also used to be at least 6 banchan (side dishes), lately it's only 4
- Raw egg that comes with the soon tofu tasted old and off on more than one occasion

The service is all over the place- more than once, I have been here when it was a full restaurant with only one server and one cook. Waited almost 50 minutes for food and near the end of the meal the server put up a sign on the door turning customers away. 

The actual restaurant is pretty beat up and needs a good cleaning- the cups and pitchers really need to be replaced."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon and it was empty. So after looking at the menu I settled for a good ol bibimbap and mom went for a spicy seafood tofu soup. Waitress asked if we wanted salad or fish, we both wanted fish. I must say, the fish is pretty good and it was on the house. When the side dishes came it was alright, nothing special and there's 5 dishes. My bbb was alright, but imo its overpriced. It's $9.99 where a lot of other places would be charging $6.99-8.99. That's only the veggie bbb too! If you wanted the beef one its $14.99?! My mom's seafood soup was alright, but in her seafood soup there's only one piece of mussel and one piece of shrimp. Where's the rest of the seafood?! 

By the time we were ready for the bill there were about 6 other tables and half of them were served their food. It's not busy by any means but all the staff were eating in the back table. It was as if I were interrupting their lunch when I wanted more tea and the bill. I've never really seen anything like this at the peak of lunch service. 

All in all, food was mediocre, overpriced and service wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Standing for 5 minutes looking at 2 empty tables, when the waitress came over, and ask if we can be seated, she said no table!!!?? Ehhhh.... then I think what she means is that she is the only one, she was overwhelmed, and no table \"yet\".

I don't blame her, we have sat down now for 15 minutes and I can still see the people ahead us still not being served.  Nice staff, but extremely busy place without enough staff to service which was a bad decision from management.

Great food for sure, but if this what I am going to get next time, they are definitely will go out of business due to bad management."}
{"text":"Judging by the portions in the pictures here, I feel like this restaurant needs to be more prepared, both staff wise and food wise. Came at around 2pm, the restaurant was starting to empty out (only 3-4 tables occupied with people), but all the tables were filled with dirty dishes. There was only one poor girl running around serving the customers. She acknowledged us when we entered the store and came to quickly clear up the dirty dishes on the table that we were appointed to. The tables felt cramped and chairs felt too low for the table, and the place felt a dirty when I was seated. Not to mention, the girl just piled the dirty dishes onto the next table to clear ours. Anyway, few moments after, she gave us the menu but notified us that rice was sold out. Basically 90% of the menu is served with rice so what do we order? The menu was pretty small with few options so there was really nothing we could decide on considering there was 3 of us. Unfortunately, we had to get up and leave because we just didn't know what to order at that point and they didn't seem to have enough people working anyway, so we would just be doing them a favour if we left. I really hope they hire more people because the pictures of the food made me really want to give this place a try. Maybe better luck next time.

Side note: they should fix their broken door as everyone entering and leaving had trouble using it."}
{"text":"The food is good but the wait is horrible. Time after time, we would usually wait around 30-60 minutes for the food to come out. Finally, we had it and left because they forgot our order from waiting for 1 hour. The wait isn't worth the food unless you have a lot of time. They only had 2 staff working and the waiter was all flustered from the chaos. It just ruined our day.

To sum up the experience, the service is horrible but its not the waiters fault, its the manager/boss. The food is okay but has been going downhill since opening.

I used to love this restaurant but am now disappointed."}
{"text":"Tofu soup is warm and comforting, perfect during a cold days during the winter!  As for tofu places, I've only been to bak chong soon tofu, so I'm comparing this place to there. I like this place more since theyre more generous with ingredients. Hot spicy soup served with purple rice :)"}
{"text":"I have a totally delighted experience at Sogong-Dong Tofu House for lunch this afternoon!! The lone waiter is the most courteous waiter I have at least in an Asian restaurants.. Maybe Sogong-Dong read Jennifer M's reviews and decide to step up their service??

Lunch Specials (11-3) nothing too excited...The combination combo are $2 cheaper than dinner time. I was really hungry this afternoon because my unsatisfying meatless dinner experience at Guu Sakabar the night before, I decided to order:

Korean BBQ ribs+Soon Tofu ($12.99) but later changed to Bulgogi instead because the kitchen said the ribs not too good this afternoon.

Choice of Free Appeitizers: Fish or Salad
- Fish is a palm sized fish with heads and everything, battered than deep fried.. I was surprised that it was not fishy at all.. and in fact really tasty! I can imagine myself having a beer and munch on that

Five Banchans
- good quality and nicely presented
- really clean and thoughtfully done.. not the standard ones at some cheaper Korean restaurant
- My waiter asked me numerous time if I want refills.. I might have stuff myself even before the main course

Combination Soon Tofu hot
- definitely not hot enough... but I guess you can always request extra extra hot!
- purple rice and served in hot stove pot with the waiter serving me :) just like Buk Chang
- The rice a little soggy but not bad... I finished the whole thing 

Beef Bulgogi
- A little disappointing.. size is small for $5 exta.
- The flavour is ok.. but it is just standard Korean Supermarket marinated stir fried sliced beef
- SKIP!!!

Service! Great Service! Waiter speaks perfect English and with great smile! Yes it is important smile to your customers and say Thank you!

Sogong-Dong Tofu House will be the to go place when I am up in Hwy 7 area and have a craving for some Soon Tofu!!

They accepts Visa and Mastercard. Opens from 11 to 11!"}
{"text":"Great soups especially during the winter. Soups are hearty and the rice is cooked perfectly. Ambience is nothing special. Service is fine."}
{"text":"Slow wait as usual, guess they're just slow.

The only reason this didn't get a 1 star is the food is still quite good for the price.  I had the Beef and Dumpling tofu soup which came with purple rice (very tasty) and came with the Korean appetizers and a piece of deep fried fish (good, but it wasn't boneless).

They really need to work on their service"}
