{"text":"What a wonderful time this morning at Crazy Mocha.  JT and Saron (super friendly!) helped me figure out what I wanted and eventually talked me into their delicious and unique Chai Latte.  So glad they did!  
Their drinks are 15% off before 8AM and after 2PM right now and they have a great selection of food.  The space was nice, clean, and quiet.
\"Hill yes!\" I'm coming back again"}
{"text":"So happy that this location is finally open! It's a great addition to the Hill and is a black owned business. They have a great selection of drinks and foods. The staff is very nice and if you aren't satisfied with what you got just let them know they're always making sure they get things right!"}
{"text":"This is a great location! The owners are very kind and welcoming and my drink tasted great! There is a ton of free or street parking and a lot of indoor or outdoor seating."}
