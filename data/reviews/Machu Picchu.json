{"text":"Its so unfortunate i did not enjoy the food i had high hopes but when we recieved our meal it was bad at all levels taste, quality, presentation  too salty looked like frozen seafood and ceviche was made wrong.  I am peruvian and was raised with good traditional foods but what there serving up is wrong on all levels and some items over priced..a plate of stir fried rice $20 Really?"}
{"text":"I decided to try Machu Picchu for the first time last night and was not diassapointed. Everything from the toasted Peruvian Corn, to the Tamal, to my Anticuchos was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. A creamy, peppery, spicy sauce was served with my tamal which was great and the citrus marinated onions were superb. I am already looking forward to coming back to Macchu Picchu as soon as possible, probably this weekend..."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD Peruvian food... Never in my life have I had such delicous peruvian food.... NOT EVEN IN CHICAGO... Their ceviche is to die for... their Anticuchos, to die for... their rotiserie Chicken, TO DIE FOR... The place is clean and the ambience is super... Good salsa music on the background. The place is awesome to bring friends and share meals... (THEY ARE BIG)... Now if it was BYOB id never go anywhere else.!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service  After reed few reviews I was indecisive to go and tried this restaurant  But I'm glad I did"}
{"text":"Long wait to sit down and order our food. Ordered the Peruvian Chinese rice with chicken beef and shrimp and it was okay. Wife ordered the seafood soup which was bland, thick and just not good at all. Woke up with stomach issues next day. Overpriced for sure."}
{"text":"Good tasty food but not what I expected from Peru.  It was mainly Chineese in flavor. The calamari was very good and so was the chicken fried rise. The Beef With Stir fried Onions And Peppers Was OK. The restaurant was rustic and dated butit lent a great anthmospher with great music.the price was very expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that I spent most of my evening throwing up after this meal (truth) , this was a terrible meal and was so over price, looking at between 18-20 per entree and its a little hole in the ground type of restaurant with terrible atmosphere. Food was absolutely gross, salt was overpowering, service was meh.. everyone at our table was really unimpressed (its not just a me thing). Go somewhere else, REALLY REALLY BAD food.  Will never go back!!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch date here and the food was amazing! Lots of authentic flavour and fresh ingredients. The restaurant was really clean and our server was bery friendly. Can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  It totally has a home style family owned and operated vibe.  The crowd was a mix of bag, but everyone seemed to be enjoying the wonderful atmosphere and food!  The food was AMAZING!!! We enjoyed about 4 different items from the menu, all were very tasty, seemed authentic, (from the Peruvian food, my uncle has made for me) and the portion sizes were pretty big!! I would say one main entree is enough food for two people if you order an appetizer. The prices were a bit high, but the quality and quantity were both very good, well worth it.  They had karaoke on the Friday night we enjoy! With a mix of Spain and English songs and a big selection.   There was ample free parking.  The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is that there was only one waitress for the whole place... on a Friday night, but the owner was there helping out.  I didn't mind the timing of the service, but we were a group of 20+ and some of our party got bothered by the lack of attention... that being said, if you want service, sometimes all you have to do is ask!"}
{"text":"Great food, but not so great service.  Server took 15 minutes to come back and tell us he runned out one specific fish we order.  Services I give them 2 out of 5. Food give them 5 out of 5...."}
{"text":"Given number of reviews with patrons becoming ill afterwards, and me too, I cannot recommend.   Came here with my family and were excited to dine. No one else was in the restaurant which should have been our first warning as it was supper hour.   Kids orders from kids menu. We ordered. I ordered black scallops...take note. Was told they are very fresh, very fresh. Server returned 5 minutes later, didn't have one child's choice. Ordered something different. Returned 5 minutes later, didn't have that either. Ended up with a hot dog...didn't realize that was local cuisine. That was second warning.   All the while someone kept going out side door, returning a few minutes later with a plastic bag. Shopping for our dinner? Third warning?  Time waned on, cold hotdogs arrived. Fourth warning.  Black scallops arrived in a martini glass...take note. They were plastered with raw chopped onions. I'm not a chef but know that raw onions will kill the taste of just about anything. Hmm...fifth warning...  Sidebar- for those that don't know, black scallops are raw clams or so I'm told. They must be served absolutely fresh, straight from ocean is best. I thought hey, it's a restaurant in Oakville, what could go wrong?  For the next 48hrs I intermittently vomited or had diarrhea or had both at the same time. Try that once and you'll never come to this establishment nor wish your worst enemy dine here.   Steer clear and hope the health department shuts them down soon. Beware when someone tells you something is very fresh!"}
{"text":"QUE RICO!!! This is my second Peruvian restaurant attempt in Charlotte.  The first one was a bust, but holy guacomole finally an amazing peruvian restaurant.  My friend and I started with anticuchos as an appetizer which were perfect.  Their aji (hot sauce) was bomb ass.  They had the red and the green, which the green is probably the best aji IMO.  For entrees I had the Ceviche Mixto (authentic as a motha) which was so freaking good i wanted to put a straw in it and drink the juices at the end.  My friend had the Jalea ( fried seafood platter) which was also authenitc and tasted amazing.  I have eaten tons of Peruvian cuisine, but my friend had never tried it.  I am now pretty sure he is hooked.  The plates were so big that it took us an hour to finish all our food. Honestly after this, we didnt eat the rest of the day. I will def be back in a couple weeks.  The only problem I had was their prices on some things seemed a little high, but then again this is the only good Peruvian place I have found in Charlotte so its worth it.  We got out of the door for around $40 for the both of us. FINALLY A GOOD PERUVIAN PLACE!  * if you never had peruvian food things to try are papa la hauncania, Aji de Gallina, and Lomo Saltado.  My favorite things are anticuchos, Jalea, Ceviche ( a must), and Pollo a la brasa.    PROS Authenitic Taste was impeccable.  It didn't feel like homemade, but more restaurant quality if that makes sense to you. CEVICHE CEVICHE CEVICHE the way its supposed to be done. They give you so much food that I now waddle instead of walk. The waitress even gave me their recipe for the green AJI.  CONS Some items seemed overpriced, but then again I lived in the hood in NJ.  Pollo a la brasas in the hood would cost half what they charged."}
{"text":"Authentic? yes ... just not a really good restaurant. I really like Peruvian food, love much of it, really. Due to a significant amount of Asian immigration their cuisine is one of the original fusion foods, seafood and rice meets hot chili peppers sauces, roasted corn and  sweet potatoes.   A major delicacy is Ceviche, which if you never tried I'd describe as \"not really raw sashimi\" - raw fish and seafood is briefly marinated first in lemon, lime cilantro etc. The better restaurants marinate it only right before it's served but the run of the mill joint (like this one) keeps it in the fridge ready made, loosing it's texture and freshness.  When we walked into the restaurant that night we found a crowd of over a hundred Peruvians gathered around the several TVs. There was a live broadcast of a World Cup elimination game between Peru and their arch rivals Chile. This made for a very loud and heated dinner! It was fun.   So yes it's all very authentic, just not very fresh nor particularly well prepared. Skip the ceviche and give a try to the Chaufa de mariscos, seafood fried rice. Another version is the Arroz con mariscos, a local version of the Spanish Paella, also very good but personally I prefer my rice crispy rather than mushy.   Be sure to ask for lots of the chili sauce to mix with it, they have green and red sauces, not the yellow I like best. The green is normally super spicy but this one was mild so I used the red one. I asked for and used so much of it that the Colombian waitress asked me if I was Peruvian myself, lol!. The rice was a bit mushy, but like I said not the best example of Peruvian cuisine. Also the new owners don't have a liquor license, so no beer or wine. I asked about BYO and paying a corkage fee but I was told this practice is not legal in NC.   Really 2 1/2 stars but around these parts it may the best there is."}
{"text":"Not Closed, moved to Polk St in Pineville. I found it on accident and my Peruvian friend told me it was the same place! Haven't been to the new location yet, but plan to very soon.  Repeat, NOT CLOSED!!!!"}
{"text":"I am Peruvian and this restaurant has the best approach to the original Peruvian food. It is very tasty.I am only talking about the food per se, because normally to prepare Peruvian food takes more time than other dishes, so the service should improve a little bit."}
{"text":"Still basking in the afterglow of this wonderful find and can't wait to go back! My husband and I decided to brave this restaurant after reading some awesome reviews and I have to say, we are glad we did. We started with the tamal and papa rellenas (deep fried mashed potatoes stuffed wih ground beef?..yes pulease!) Both were amazing and out of control tasty with creamy green chili hot sauce served on the side. Then came our introduction to the craziest of all grains: Peruvian corn. Imagine regular corn with kernels three times the size, and malty sweeet flavor to match. Add queso fresco-esc cheese (and more chili sauce of course) and there you have it. We just ordered a side (under $3) in addition to my ceviche mixto and my husband's anticuchos. If the wonderful rotisserie flavor of the anticuchos was indicitive of their pollo a la brasa, I can't wait to go back to try it (I'm thinking better than Pio Pio). They also have a bakery case full of housemade confections I would have loved to have tried if I hadn't been so full already. Also, they serve breakfast everyday that boasts a tamale platter with chicharrones and sweet potato fries. This restaurant is a little off the beaten path, but do yourself a favor and try it. You'll feel great knowing you shared an authentic meal, tried something new, and supported honest ethnic cuisine in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Hubby & I had dinner here last night, heard a lot about this place, so we were looking forward to it our meals were delicious, we had the mahi mahi ceviche, very yummy dish. Great little nook, wonderful staff friendly & fast ."}
{"text":"After my husband and heard about this place from a friend we immediately went to check it out, seeing as how we both love Peruvian food to the max. Now, I have some mixed feelings about this restaurant and  in the end I just can't give it any more than 3 stars, and here is why:  I ordered the Mahi Mahi ceviche and it was absolutely divine. However, as good as it tastes, the portion to price ratio is way off. You get a tennis ball size amount for the roaring price of $16.99. Now I know seafood tend to be a little up there, but ceviche is quite inexpensive to make!   Now the service there is a little baffling. When my husband and I walked in the door, we wern't sure if it was a seat-yourself situation or not because there was no waiter in sight for 5 minutes as we stood there by the door like a pair of idiots. Finally, after 5 minutes the waitress came and told us to sit anywhere by the far end of the restaurant, but right after we sat down she told us we had to move because apparently half of that area was reserved for a large party. After this we thought we could finally order and eat, but we waited over 10 minutes just to get our menu, followed by the waitress disappearing for another 20 minutes or so before she came back to take our orders. My husband ordered an English soda and twice the waitress brought the wrong drink. After getting our food, the \"big party\" came in and from that point on was just an incredibly disruptive experience, as they kept bumping into the back of my chair and was so loud I could barely carry out a conversation with my husband. At that point we just wanted to finish the food and get the hell out, which we did.   food 4/5 service 1/5"}
{"text":"After moving back to Charlotte from out West I wanted to find a Peruvian Restaurant which could come close to my favorite in L.A. \"Mario's\".  I thought it wasn't possible.  Mily y Lalo's surpassed all of my expectations.  The people there are so nice, always a family vibe, and the food is SPECTACULAR.  A wide range of authentic Peruvian dishes, my favorite being the Lomo Saltado de Pollo, with an egg on top of course."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my order or ceviche. It was a little expensive but the portion was so large that I felt like I got my money's worth. you get some potato, sweet potato, maiz gigante, and said corn toasted (which i really don't get) to mix with your meal.  I'd like to see how their roast chicken is."}
{"text":"Machu Picchu actually serves Peruvian food.  Something I don't think that I've ever had.  I don't know that there's anything really odd about it, though it does sound a bit intimidating.  I can't tell you how many times I've driven past this place, but it's been a long time since I've been inside.  Way back when it was Loafers - probably ten years ago!  Now the outside has been remade, but the inside hasn't undergone much more than a paint job and some new light fixtures.  It's fairly bright: And made even more so by the fact that they were shooting a commercial.  The furnishings are somewhat sparse.  They might even be leftovers from the Loafers day.  Nothing fancy at all.  But the staff is friendly.  I'd give them a big thumbs up, as they try and make you feel at home.  Helpful, as on a chilly night like tonight, the place was downright cold!  Luckily, the food helped in that regard as well.  Everything was tasty, though nothing was really outstanding.  The best thing of the night was actually something ordered by my wife - a steak and rice dish with onions and tomatoes over fries (called \"Lomo Saltado\").  Excellent.  My own was just average.  See the pics if you'd like to check out some visuals.  If you happen to be a Time-Warner customer, be sure to look for a coupon for buy one, get one free."}
{"text":"My parents held an engagement party at Machu Pichu for us. It was OUTSTANDING. The owner,Roberto, made sure that the service, the food, the ambiance was taken care of. I cannot express with words how delicious everything was. Our guests raved about the food and the experience. They also had access to a live band that put all of out guests to dance."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant was really sweet and the staff was really friendly. I do agree that the food is way overpriced for what you get. I got the calamari and it was really tasty, albiet really salty. It was one of the cheaper items on the menu at $16. It is good food, the quality seems pretty good too-- its just pretty pricy for a meal probably not worth more than $8"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a low review because upon entering we waited for 5 minutes , not knowing if we should sit or stand because there was no waiter in sight.  Finally when she came out she told us there was a big party reserved and it would be better if we came Back another night!!!  Need I say more! Never again"}
{"text":"Bad location, service and value however the food was tasty and Peruvian. I would like a more organized table layout, access to see the waiter so not to have to get up to ask for drinks. 9 people are and drank merrily and spent $350 with tax&tip."}
{"text":"This is REAL Peruvian food that I have had a nostalgia for since I left the country. You can tell this place is great by all the Peruvians that come in foe their favorite dishes. They even serve actual choclo (Andean corn) with that great cheese. Staff is very friendly and the place is decorated with kitschy Peruvian souvenirs--which actually adds to its authenticity, as it is how many restaurants in Cuzco are decorated to pander to curious tourists. I aim to visit this place every time I come into town!"}
{"text":"*Sodium Alert*  Everything here tasted way too salty... My mouth was numbing from the amount of sodium I was consuming in soup and main dishes. All I tasted was salt.   And very overpriced (no lunch menu and everything is like 16$++ per dish including soup and apps) did not expect this especially being located on speers Rd...  Service was extremely slow considering the place was pretty much empty...  Won't be coming back."}
