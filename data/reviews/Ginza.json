{"text":"I love this place I have been going there regularly whenever I am in the mood for good sushi!    Ginza is by far the best Sushi I have had in Pittsburgh!  Being that Pittsburgh has no ocean in sight it is amazing that the sushi here easily rivals sushi I have gotten in good sushi places in Boston, NY or SF.  The fish is quite fresh unlike many other sushi places in Pittsburgh!  Also the menu is the most extensive for sushi that I have seen in in this city if you are looking for more then a California or tuna roll.   I think this place is relatively new because they don't have their liquor license yet so it is BYOB (ie. bring your own sake or Sapporo or whatever your beverage of choice is with sushi!)  ... and try the Guava candy on your way out.. it is good too :-)"}
{"text":"Outstanding menu, pricing, and service. We had a LivingSocial $15 for $30 coupon, so that was naturally great. Awesome BYOB. They were kind enough to move us, mid-meal, to the table outside that had been previously occupied so that we could enjoy the weather. They have a $38 special for 2 featuring 2 standard rolls (we did spicy tuna and spicy scallop), 2 special rolls (the waitress suggested Angry Dragon and Ginza, which both kicked ass), and either a miso soup or house salad to start for each. Can't say enough good things about these guys!"}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome and service was top notch. We had hibachi and sushi and they were both spot on.   Restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was pleasant.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Yum. The menu online was limited but when I sat down it took forever for me to decide what to get. I ordered the \"Amazing Chicken\" and was indeed amazed. Pretty much your standard sweet & sour chicken with chunks of fresh pineapple which was a nice touch, but tasted phenomenal. Came with a side of fried rice and miso soup and salad. Soup was OK, could have had a little more kick and the salad was not the best because the lettuce was really watery. However, the main portion was an A+. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Got takeout a couple days ago. A little difficult to communicate with female staff member on the phone, but food was nice."}
{"text":"Food: Ginza offers traditional Japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodles, with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well. We started with the miso soup, which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night. We followed with the edamame appetizer. Its hard to mess up edamame, and Ginza definitely didn't, but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise average dish stand out. There were other interesting appetizer choices, like seaweed salad, fresh spring rolls, and avocado salad, all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame. We then ordered the vegetable sushi roll, which contained avocado, asparagus, and cucumber (any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll). The roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made. There were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu; tofu vegetable teriyaki, tofu tempura, vegetable hibachi, and vegetable udon noodles. The udon noodles can be prepared pan-fried or in broth soup-style. The pan-fried udon noodles were quite bland, covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice. The tofu teriyaki was slightly more interesting, with a thicker, more tasty sauce, but wasn't anything memorable and some of the vegetables were cold on the inside. The tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside. Ginza does not put any hot sauce, pepper seeds, or chili paste on the table, and also do not offer a spiciness scale, so you can't really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor. The lead-ins to the main course were not bad but not great, and the entrees were pretty lackluster. Overall, it seems as if Ginza doesn't have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items. Meat and fish eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying.  Price: The prices were very reasonable, as we ordered two soups, an appetizer, a sushi roll, and two entrees for under $30. We were hungry, so we didn't have enough left to bring home (although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor), but the portion sizes are above average.   Drinks: Ginza is BYOB but they do offer Japanese teas and sodas in addition to regular fountain drinks.  Atmosphere: The restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit tables. There are tables for small and large parties, and enough space so that you aren't sitting directly on top of your neighbors. However, the restaurant is basically one big room and when the door opens on a cold night, you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are anywhere near the front. It isn't too difficult to find a parking spot on Liberty or one of its side streets.  Service: We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, often checking our table and re-filling our water. We requested an addition of tofu to the udon noodles, which the waitress approved, but when the plate came the tofu was missing. We were also served our appetizer, sushi, and entrees within five minutes of each other, creating a table full of hot food getting cold.  (+): cheap prices, large portions  (-): average to below-average vegetarian food  Would I go back again? Probably not, although I wouldn't stop a meat-eating friend from giving Ginza a shot."}
{"text":"The sushi was fine - the seaweed on the wraps was a bit tough/chewy but overall it's decent sushi if not slightly overpriced for the quality. However the biggest issue was with the service - it was rushed at times and slow at others. The waiter repeatedly commented how much sushi we got (3 special rolls and 1 small roll) between two people and also commented on how much we ate of it. He made both of us very uncomfortable. Fine place to get sushi if you're in a rush but avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Sushi is wonderful, prices reasonable, service is Very good-natured. BYOB was nice. Pad Thai OK, but the texture of the shrimp a little chewy."}
{"text":"We had the ginza roll, octopus sashimi, and shrimp sushi. The sushi was good and fresh. The service was also nice and it was relatively fast. It was not very busy, but we were there on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"This was really good.  We went here last night for dinner after trying to go to a few places in the area that didn't have a table.  Big bonus since its BYOB! The fish was fresh, the rolls were delicious, and the sushi was reasonably priced. This will definitely be one of our go to spots for sushi and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi here is very fresh and of high quality. There is a large selection of specialty rolls on the menu, which are my favorite items to order, and each roll is unique and delicious. The presentation of the sushi also never disappoints. The menu is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive. I have been here countless times and I always leave very happy with my dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant as it is one of my favorite sushi spots in the city."}
{"text":"Beware! I am pretty sure that they are serving fake tuna. It certainly has the deep red color as real tuna but it definitely does not have the taste or texture of real tuna. I am also skeptical of the fish that was supposed to be salmon (or whatever the orange one is supposed to be). The shrimp seemed okay.   We got the $50 \"Love Boat\". It definitely wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I had the Sushi Deluxe.  Which was a 9 piece of sushi and a tuna roll.  I asked for Eel and they added it in for me which was cool, since it wasn't part of the usual 9 pieces.  The sushi itself, though, was tiny.  Each piece was about half the size that you would get at a better sushi restaurant like Andys, Chaya, or Sushi Too.  For the same price I could've gotten twice the amount at a little better quality.  The fish wasn't too great and two of the pieces were very chewy and kinda gross.  I like cheap sushi, but this isn't cheap enough to justify its poor taste.   I give it 2 stars due to the size of the rolls and the amount of food I got for 17 dollars.  I'm not too picky about my sushi, but really I'd rather spend the same somewhere better or less at a real cheap place like Sushi Boat in oakland."}
{"text":"Very good soups, sushi, seaweed salads, and desserts.  Top quality sushi for very fair prices. By far the best deal you'll ever find in the city."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food and service have been consistently good both times.  Most recently we ordered the Maki for Two which comes with either salad or soup. The ginger dressing they use is really good so I wouldn't hesitate to get the salad. As for the Maki for Two, we went with salmon, tuna, Zen and Tiger rolls. Good portion sizes make this a pretty good deal, plus everything tasted really fresh. Living within walking distance is an added bonus but for the quality and value this place is also worth the drive."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place one date-night and I was pleasently surprised. The BYOB was deffiantly a great perk as we stopped by the liquor store and picked up our favorite white.    We ordered a kani salad and the tartar to start. The kani salad was not as traditional as we are used to but good non the less. Now the tartar was probably one of the best tartars I have ever had. It came with some ponzu/yuzu dipping sauce and cucumbers to scoop it up with. Deffiantly delicious.     Now for the rolls. We ordered 4 rolls. 2 traditional (spicy tuna and salmon) and 2 of their specialty rolls. All were very good and larger in size than I am typically used to. Fatter if you will.     Food quality and taste ranked high for us. Price was a little higher than most Pittsburgers would be used to. But with what you save on the alcohol and the quality of fish it is worth it. (1 soup, 1 salad, 1 tartar, 2 traditional rolls, and 2 specialty rolls came to $67)    Only sort of downfall was the ambiance. We were one of only two tables in there. Probably wouldve felt a little more comfortable if it was a little noisier or busier. However, we will deffiantly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I just found Ginza, and my hubby and I ate there today. Best sushi I've had in years!! The server was also really friendly, and the restaurant was really nice. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and weird.  We had a couple waiters and they weren't coordinating with one another. The hibachi rice had an off putting taste and the rolls were what you'd expect as part of a lunch special. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This place was great. Family went last night for dinner great japanese food with good presentation. I had the pork dumplings and wife had veg spring rolls. Main for me soup style chicken with vegetables and wifey had the amazing chicken, did not disappoint. Excellant food and good service will be going back."}
{"text":"This is TRULY a hidden gem of Pittsburgh! I have lived in Pittsburgh for nine years, and this is definitely one of my top 3 favorite restaurants of Pittsburgh. My husband and I try to eat here at least once a month, and surprisingly it has also become one of his favorite restaurants of Pittsburgh.   Ginza is perfect for our Friday date night. The atmosphere is relaxed yet romantic, and the price is definitely right. It's BYOB. We are always shocked by how few people know about this little treasure. We have never had to wait to find a seat on a Friday evening.   My husband is not a sushi or sashimi fan, but I am. We both seem to find an entree that suites us. My husband is very much a \"meat and potato\" kind of guy, so what a God sent it was for him to actually ENJOY food at a nice Japanese restaurant. My favorite sushi treat is the Lobster Tempura roll. My husband consistently orders the Shrimp Hibachi. We are both obsessed with the Yum Yum sauce that comes with it. We share the red bean mochi and green tea mochi for dessert, and the consistency of the shell is always perfect.    Only one con: parking is difficult in the area. You may need to circle around some side streets to find some on-street parking.  I highly recommend Ginza, and we hope more people will discover this wonderful restaurant gem of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Ginza has, by far, the BEST sushi in the Pittsburgh area. The quality of the fish is excellent; no \"fishy\" taste. I ordered (take-out) the Aloha Roll, the Naruto Roll, and the Alaska Roll and all three were delish! The host was especially helpful as I chose which rolls to order; he asked what I liked/didn't like and made recommendations based off of my input. They have a large selection of sushi to choose from as well which I really liked. The prices for the rolls are pretty comparable to other sushi restaurants, and ranged from ~$5 to ~$17 depending on the ingredients included in the roll. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got the Maki for two for myself,   The food itself was pretty good. Nothing too special stood out to me, but the maki for two deal is unbeatable.   On the bright side, everything that was tempura in the rolls were still crispy which is a huge plus! Not warm, but crispy.   The server was nice, kind and considerate.  The reason I am docking two stars is because our food took 1.5 hours. For a dine in restaurant, this is unacceptable. We got edename while waiting, but never too much of a reason for the delay!"}
{"text":"2.5 / 5 - House Salad: Tangy sweet dressing, but the salad was a bit watery and had more iceburg lettuce than I like.  Subsequent visits have been much better, though. 2.5 / 5 - Tuna Avocado Roll: Slightly above average-sized,  tender and fresh.  A well done simple and pure roll. 2.5 / 5 - Spicy Salmon Roll: Finely chopped, not ground, salmon with a bit of crunchiness and spicy mayo. 2.5 / 5 - Spicy Yellowtail Roll 1.5 / 5 - Yellowtail Roll: The yellowtail chunks are not as tender as the others, so I much prefer this in spicey chopped form. 1.5 / 5 - Spicy Girl Roll: This roll lost much of its crunchiness, especially when compared to the two other spicy rolls.  There was too much mayo and mushiness. 3.0 / 5 - Tuna Lover Roll: Added some flare to the simple elegant tuna flavor which was not overpowering.  Nice lunch special."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh. It's never busy and the food is great. I love the red tiger roll and the spicy girl roll. Also, if you get sashimi they give you HUGE pieces and sometimes give you three pieces instead of just two.   The service is great, and while I REALLY wish they delivered, they make take out really easy - they remember my name/order every time I call."}
{"text":"While attending a convention in Pittsburgh, and losing track of time at Home Depot buying supplies, we called Ginza at 10 minutes to their closing time - and were thrilled that we did not have to spend the night with a pizza!  The staff was friendly and efficient at taking our phone order. We had only a 5 minute wait while they finished preparing the last of our rolls, and were on our way at 10 minutes AFTER closing time. We were served water while we waited, which was very attentive of the wait staff.  Back at our hotel, the sushi rolls and edamame were both excellent. There was plenty of soy sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger packed in the take-out bag. Preparation was perfect, taste was divine. I will definitely be visiting Ginza in 2015 when I go back for next year's convention."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I got sushi and it was excellent. Probably one of the top sushi places in pittsburgh.  The second time I came I got a hibatchi dish. I have had horrendous food poisoning for 4 straight days, I'm guessing because the chicken was bad. I thought it tasted a little bit off but not enough to send it back. I have gotten horrendously ill though from the food, and I have a strong stomach, this if the first time I've ever gotten food poisoning. Be very very cautious of this restaurant, unfortunately I recommend everyone to avoid."}
{"text":"Really great chicken katsu. Tasty sushi--better than most places in Pittsburgh, for sure.  Friendly staff (if occasionally a little awkward!).  Lovely ambiance, quiet and calm.  Prompt service.  I've got pretty much no complaints.  And the portion sizes are respectable, for a very good price!  I expect that the price will go up and the portion sizes down, within the  next few months--it's just too good."}
{"text":"I was cautious about trying this restaurant - I'm very picky about sushi and generally try out a couple rolls before attempting sushi/sashimi.  On our first visit, I had their lunch special - 3 rolls and a salad.  I had the eel cucumber, a tuna and a salmon roll.  All of them were quite acceptable and the stage was set for a 'real' visit.  I finally dragged the husband there late one night when we didn't feel like driving somewhere.  He had the hibachi chicken, which came with big piles of rice and veggies as well as chicken.  I had a tuna roll, salmon sashimi, special white tuna sushi and unagi sushi.  Other than the weird presentation of the sashimi (wrapped around cucumber like you'd get in a cucumber roll) - everything tasted good and was quite fresh.  I actually wanted more of the special white tuna, but restrained myself."}
{"text":"Stopped here before getting a tattoo nearby. Restaurant is clean and nice inside. We were immediately seated and their was only one other couple inside at the time.   I ordered the Ginza Roll and my date ordered Cali rolls with a side of spicy mayo. Both came out great. I absolutely loved the Ginza rolls!"}
{"text":"Today my friend and I stopped by for lunch and were greeted by a very friendly waiter who was chatty and nice. After looking over the lunch menu we settled on ordering suchi (3 rolls for $11, great price) and an order of Beef Teriyaki which came with our choice of miso or salad. I ordered the miso and it was warm (not hot) and was nothing to write home about. When our sushi came out, it looked nice on the plate, but was nothing above and beyond. Regular, not so interesting or tasty, but okay. (Rolls were Spicy Salmon, Cucumber and Eel, and Avocado and Tuna). Next came the Beef Teriyaki. It arrived on the plate with some shredded carrot and rice, and the meat sat on top of cooked green pepper, celery and onion. It arrived slightly warm and without much taste.   The atmosphere is nice, the people are nice, but the food was just not very good or worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Went for a weekday lunch. Their bento boxes were flavorful and the sushi rolls had a variety of options in their 3 for $11 special. Friendly staff. I would select something other than the mango shrimp bento option next time but felt like trying something new."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood sushi spot and I'm never disappointed after coming here.  I've eaten inside multiple times(awesome cause BYOB) and I've also done carry-out; both are great.  They have a great lunch special where you can get 3 rolls for $11.  Overall, Pittsburgh isn't a great sushi city but this place is one of the better spots and you'll always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in the city. It's always made perfectly and presented very nicely. The Hibachi and some of the other options on the menu are all extremely good too, especially the calamari."}
{"text":"Ginza is easily the single best bang for your buck restaurant in the city.  Great food at an even greater price, and the people who work are always incredibly friendly.   It's also BYOB, which is always a plus.  I'm very happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh.  I've had sushi in a bazillion different places, Ginza is consistently the best.  Awesome service, too!"}
{"text":"I was there for lunch, 6 people total. Very fresh sushi with a superb lunch special. Service is friendly and attentive. The sushi is not complex but is reasonably priced and fresh."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the sushi and sashimi served here is not good enough to consider a return visit. Cold, bland, fishy and worse than from packaged boxes you might get in the supermarket or at a takeaway stand.  The miso soup was oddly sweet - not in a bad way, but notable.  Service was decent. Perhaps the cooked meals are better here, but if you're coming for raw fish and rice you may find yourself disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good fresh sushi with a nice variety.  Great service too. This is our go to sushi restaurant now."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Japanese restaurant. BYOB made it an even more affordable date night. I have never had a poor meal here. Our top pick was the hibachi chicken. Sushi was also very good. Don't forget about the hibachi sauce - made with a hint of sriracha for the extra kick. Eat it."}
{"text":"Ginza serves a good variety of sushi and sashimi in a setting that is somewhat upscale but still comfortable enough for one to go there for a causal dinner. Most of the sushi is good. Not amazing, but the regular rolls are solid and some of the specialty rolls are very good. My personal favorite is the Greenwich roll. Prices are reasonable, even by Pittsburgh standards, and the restaurant is BYOB.   The service was a little rocky when the restaurant opened, but it has steadily improved since then and now is good. I wouldn't celebrate my wedding  anniversary there, but it seems like a good place to go with friends or your partner for sushi."}
{"text":"The sevice came with a smile here. The server was incredibly friendly and made suggestions off of the menu as I had not been here before."}
{"text":"Great service. I asked for the most popular sushi dish and loved it. The clear soup hit the spot. I would go back again and try another popular dish or share some with friends."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from Ginza on a Sunday so I cannot speak to any aspect of eating in the restaurant. I walked in to order from the menu and the front staff told me it would be able 30 minutes. I returned 30 minutes later only to be asked to wait an additional 5-10 minutes. I decided to wait at one of their outdoor tables. After 20 minutes, I returned inside to ask if my food was done. It was not and the front desk staff explained that it was very busy and the kitchen was backed up. When all was said and done--it took about 60 minutes for my order to be ready.   That was a bad start. When I got home, I found the sushi to be fresh and tasty so that did redeem Ginza in my eyes. I enjoyed all three of the rolls I had ordered. I really liked the spicy sauce they use--its a bit spicier than other sushi restaurants which is preferable for me."}
{"text":"Great service! They are very quick, the orders are always right, and the workers are super nice! Also a great place for a small lunch or dinner! :)"}
{"text":"Went here a while ago with Sarah S. Most of the sushi was pretty good. Like Rachel C., we got the 4 roll deal, and it was a steal for the price. Everything was super pretty and even came with blinking light up thingys on the plate.  That being said, the lobster was pretty bad :( pretty bad like I bit into it and wanted to spit it back out, but made myself chew and swallow it. It kind of ruined my experience.  So, sushi good, lobster bad."}
{"text":"The $21 sushi and sashimi combo for one was pretty good. The fish was fresh and the nigiri were well made. The california rolls were a bit sloppy -- but nobody cares about california rolls (it was flummoxing why they would put california rolls in the combo except to fill people up).  This place stands out as an oasis of decent sushi in this price range, in a city that is otherwise a sushi desert. The pricing is alright considering the landlocked nature of Pittsburgh and the lack of good competition."}
{"text":"Decent option for sushi. I prefer Chaya, but the mountain for two here is not bad at all."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant in a kinda hipster neighborhood near the city. Parking was a bit of a challenge and it's to be expected in these parts but after 3 laps around the block, we found a space.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly lady at the desk and seated in a location that was away from the door which was very thoughtful on her part.   The place was pretty empty with only one other table occupied by a gentleman reading a newspaper and eating sushi. This concerned me but I do trust my Yelp buddies as you guys have yet to let me down. After gazing over the menu a few times, I opted for sushi and my fellow diner chose the pan fried chicken udon.  It's kinda cool that this is really a hibachi spot without the popular shows...like Benihana or the other spot I will never mention (ahhh Ichiban choooo). Ichiban in the Waterworks/Fox Chapel area is horrible...can you tell I'm still mad at them? Sorry, not sorry.  Okay, back to Ginza...  The noodles came with a side of soup or salad. My fellow diner didn't care for their miso. It was originally thought the soup option would be the regular clear broth so the waiter happily offered to replace it. A few minutes later, however, the waiter returned with a salad. I wasn't sure how the waiter missed this with an empty restaurant. Although the salad dressing tasted more like thousand island with a bunch of mayo added, we decided not to complain because he was so very nice and hey...it's just salad anyway. Shortly after that, our selections arrived. The sushi was pretty good and the price was fair in my opinion. Tempura shrimp were cooked well and the fish tasted fresh. The udon was just okay but the chicken had that nice rich grilled taste.   While I probably wouldn't return here for a salad, soup or entree, I definately would come back for more sushi! (3 stars for sushi!)"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. It's BYOB and we brought two bottles of wine. The waitstaff is extremely friendly and the service is just the right pace. Not too fast, not too slow. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed. TV for those who want to watch the game.   I ordered the edamame for an appetizer. It was good, but not great. May have been a little older than I would've liked. The sushi was very reasonably priced. The fish was fresh and delicious! The pretty girl roll was my favorite. Sweet potato roll was an interesting one too! See mt picture for the whole plate! Can't wait to go back to Ginza."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's go-to sushi place. Parking is easy, service is friendly and their sushi is yummy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I each ordered a hibachi dinner meal, and wow, what a deal! We each asked for miso soup, instead of the clear soup that is included, at no extra cost. The miso was VERY strong/thick, but tasty. Our meals also included a small salad, which my boyfriend got with the original gingery dressing, but I omitted, since it contains dairy. The waitress kindly brought over some oil instead. The main courses were HUGE, and my vegetable hibachi was very delicious. You have your choice of fried rice or white, so I ordered fried without egg. I was stuffed, and still took some veggies home, AND my meal cost only 10 bucks (my boyfriend's steak hibachi was 15).  The atmosphere, service, and quality of food all receive A's from me. From now on, I will be coming here instead of Nakama for hibachi. And thank you for being so vegan-aware, and able to accommodate!  ***EDIT: I had to change from five stars to three, due to my recent return visit:  I had the same waitress as last time, but this time she checked with the chef about the hibachi to make sure it was vegan. She returned with sad news: the veggies are prepared with a pork base! Apparently, the only vegan entree option is to order the mango chicken with tofu instead. It was very tasty, but a bit pricey and not nearly as awesome as the hibachi. I still appreciate that the waitress took my vegan concerns into consideration, but I hope Ginza expands their menu to include more vegan-friendly options so that I may go back!"}
{"text":"First, I thought this was the Ginza from the olden days of Oakland...a land far far away. I got food poisoning once at that one, as well as delicious korean food on other occasions.  For those without reading comprehension, this is a DIFFERENT GINZA.  The plan was a hurry up offense, of watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi, and then getting sushi. I called an audible, as we had to wait until the next day to watch Jiro (and then wanted to go back!)  We with a few rolls, (eel, salmon, and spicy yellowtail) to test the waters. All were delicious. Simple, tasty, filling. I am not really a sushi guy either.  BYOB was  a huge plus, and as per usual, I ended up drinking more than my fair share. The service was very attentive, and friendly.   After nom-ing on those rolls, we decided to try a main dish- The wasabi steak. I ordered it rare, they understood what rare mean. King Richard was pleased.  The wasabi sauce was almost buttery with a bit less kick than I would have liked. Overall it was pretty good, not breathtaking, but good.  The price is very reasonable, especially compared to other recent dining (Sausalido) that was far less yummy.  Ginza is going to find its way  into my rotation like NOW that's what I call music volume 6. I'm serious!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, and portion sizes are bigger than expected. I recommend the Tri-Color Sushi! Service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"On Wednesday, I ordered 4 rolls from then 10 mins before closing but they still made it really good and not even complained about I ordered it so late. Gun a is one of my favorite sushi places."}
{"text":"I love this place.  In my opinion it is much better than the other sushi restaurant that used to be on liberty in both quality and price!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by lack of hibachi noodles and the rest of the food wasn't impressive. But the service was great!!"}
{"text":"Ginza is a good deal, especially if you're looking for some quick, cheap sushi as well as a few nice hibachi options. The service is great, and the place is clean and altogether not bad-looking on the inside. I've gone here for lunch to catch up with friends and we didn't feel pressured to leave the second we were finished our meal or anything, which was very nice. I do wish some of the entrees were less bland, but you can't have everything. Perhaps it's because I prefer a little bit more spice, but the hibachi chicken and salmon dishes I've tried were rather underwhelming. The fish used in the sashimi and sushi seems fresh for the most part though, and since it's raw that's far more important to me!"}
{"text":"Hello. My name is Christy and I am a sushi-holic.  It has been 2 weeks since my last sushi meal...  I was looking for a place to satiate my craving after visiting a friend at West Penn Hospital.  Of course I pulled up Yelp and to my surprise, Ginza was barely a two block walk away!  The photos looked tasty and my dining companion and I were able to go in and get a table right away.  The waitress was pleasant and everything from our order came out SO fast.  We started with the clear soup which was very similar to the mushroom soup I love at Silk Road, except Ginza uses a darker broth.  It was delicious and the perfect thing to warm me up on a frigid February evening.    For our sushi selections, we had a California roll (I can never pass these up!), Aloha roll (yellowtail and jalapeno topped with spicy tuna), Naruto roll (tuna and salmon wrapped in cucumber, no rice!), and salmon sashimi.  I kid you not, our food came out probably less than 10 minutes after we ordered.  It was all fantastic and I really enjoyed the Aloha roll.    I don't get over this way too often, but I'm glad to have found another yummy sushi spot for when I get that hankering... it happens more often than I should probably admit!  I did notice a BYOB sign in the front window, so that seems like as good of an excuse as ever for me to get back here soon."}
{"text":"Had the sushi sashimi bento ... The fish was on Pointe. I would recommend any sashimi lovers to come here for their fish, which was the perfect consistency. Great bargain for the quality and great service."}
{"text":"I love Ginza, its my go to sushi place in Pittsburgh. I think its the best sushi deal for the quality and quantity you get. The fish is good and fresh, granted its no Umi so don't expect that, but its a step up for sure from some comparable priced places (Sushi Too comes to mind, but I still order from there because they deliver). For the best deals on fresh fish, the sashimi appetizer is 10 pieces for $9. They also have a dinner for 2 special which is $40, comes with 2 soups or salads and you get to pick 2 special rolls (which are $11-15 each) and 2 regular rolls (also $6 each). If you do the math, its a great deal and you feel like a king when that much sushi is brought out to you. Generally, I ask for less sauce on my special rolls, I don't particularly like masking the fish flavor. Their tempura is also great, nice and crispy, and the appetizer is sizable.  Its BYOB if you are dining in, and the bulk of their business is takeout so there's never a wait for a table. Outdoor seating is available when the weather is nice, but Liberty Ave isn't the most pleasant view. If you're ordering takeout, give it 25-30 minutes for your order to be ready, sometimes 45 minutes if its peak takeout time. I do really wish they would deliver, I'd order more often!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Pittsburgh I was told pretty adamantly that there was no good sushi here. Moving from philly with dozens of decent to good sushi places this was pretty sad to hear. So imagine my surprise when one day my friends brought me to Ginza and I had some seriously delightful sushi. Not the best sushi of my life, not Jiro dreams of sushi. But very delicious, good consistency sushi on par with places in Philly. So the person who told me there was no good sushi is seriously uninformed and Ginza is awesome. Last time I was there I ordered one of the special rolls ad they made a dragon out of sauce on my plate. I'll post a photo. It was delightful. I'll be returning. a lot. I promise."}
{"text":"Terrible experience... The server was so rude. Brought out the wrong food and gave us a hard time as a result. The food was ok... not good enough to tolerate the horrible server that is clearly dissatisfied with her life.  My biggest regret is going there twice."}
{"text":"I have finally found the Holy Grail of Sushi places.... Cheap... High Quality... Beautifully made and served... What more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"Ginza has been my go-to sushi spot in Bloomfield for the last 2 years. Their sushi doesn't disappoint. Consistently fresh tasting rolls, every time. I pretty much order the 3 roll lunch special every time - it's 3 rolls plus soup or salad for a little under 12 bucks. You seriously can't beat that. Good service and rolls are made quickly when you stop in to order as well."}
{"text":"HELLO GINZA!   I found this little gem last week. And I love it! It is by work, which is trouble city for me. Twice last week I visited, and I don't plan on slowing down.   Though I must say, I have never tried any of the meals. I am reviewing on strictly sushi. The sushi was awesome. Way bigger than expected, and for what I know of freshness, seemed fresh. Try the Tuna Lover Roll if you want a specialty roll. Every one that I have tried I liked. You probably can't go wrong.  Staff was super friendly and attentive. Sushi prices are very reasonable. What can I say, I found my sushi go to in Pittsburgh! I can't wait to go back! (probably today!)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight, the food was very average at a good price -- you can get better food nearby.  Decor and atmosphere was nothing spectacular.  While the service was good we called to ask if there was a bar before arrival and were told this place was BYOB,    We brought a mini cooler with some beer.  There was no corking or bottle opening required on their part and no corking fee advertised on the menu.  We simply asked for two empty glasses, opened our own beer, poured it ourselves and were charged a $3 corking fee PER PERSON for requesting empty glasses.    If we had brought a bottle of wine, they opened it, brought a bucket of ice or gave some sort of \"corking\" service, this would have been completely acceptable.  BYOB and requesting empty glasses is not a \"corking\" service and we could have went somewhere within the same block and ordered the beer for $3 per person.  Go to Nikki's Thai Kitchen or somewhere else, this place is not worth the time.  One positive note, the dishes were very well presented."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for about 3 years and have had just about everything on the menu and it's always a fantastic meal.  Not only is the sushi fresh, but the other entrees have generous portions and taste delicious.  The staff here is fantastic and they are always helpful and pleasant.  Many people choose take-out from here and the take out is always timely and packed well for travel.  My hubby and I often order the Maki for Two, which gives you two (2) special rolls and two (2) regular rolls, plus soup or salad for each of us.  The Fried Rice dishes are always a hit as well as any of the Noodle dishes (which my hubby usually gets as the soup option).  One great thing about the Noodle dishes are that they will customize your heat level.  Hubby loves spicy foods and they not only kick up the heat in making the dish for him, but will also provide additional heat additions for him to use at the table.  It is definitely our \"Go To\" spot for sushi and Japanese food.  The interior is always clean and although it's small, there always seems to be a place to sit (which probably comes from all the take-out they do).    Pros: Great food Sushi is fresh Prices are very reasonable Staff is extremely helpful Clean (which is super important to me)  Cons: Street parking (but it's Bloomfield so it's expected)  Overall, we are faithful customers and will continue to be."}
{"text":"A solid sushi option. Highlights include reliability, fresh fish, friendly service, and plenty of room. Street parking. BYOB. My go-to family sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I have now been back several times since my last review and the woman I wrote about above has been nothing but nice. They have also hired additional wait staff as well. The food, as always, continues to be incredible. No complaints!"}
{"text":"When you're hopping off the bus in Bloomfield, it's late at night, and you have that powerful sushi craving...there's Ginza. I love that they offer a tasty hand-roll, sushi or sashimi. Their fish is cut properly, and most importantly is fresh. No, it's not as good as Penn Ave Fish Company, but it's much better than several other Pittsburgh sushi experiences I could name. The price is right too - I recently got 2 salmon handrails to go for less than $11. Everyone there is very friendly, and there is always a table available, even when you walk in. They are willing to make modifications within reason too. I absolutely love pickled ginger, and they were happy to send me on my way with extra. Overall, a great experience, and a consistent positive experience."}
{"text":"Went for my weekly sushi fix to Chaya, only to find it closed for the week. A disappointed Ramee and friend frantically Yelp a sushi joint within a reasonable distance. Ginza was destiny. We were quickly seated and served by an upbeat waitress whose sole purpose in life, it seemed, was to refill my water. I liked that.   A $2.25 house salad (with the usual ginger-y dressing) is enormous. While not as flavorful as that which crowns the puny pile of greens at Chaya, the dressing was acceptable, even if it was more mayo than ginger.   Many sushi restaurants, I've found, skimp out on the fish and wrap their rolls with heaping layers of rice to cut costs. Ginza is no such place. The sushi is wonderful--rationed just the way I like it, with a generous helping of quality fish, a thick chunk of avocado, and a delicate layer of rice. (It's not on the menu, but they can make a Yellowtail/Avocado roll if you ask..)   .:. Ginza warrants a repeat visit, which is quite the compliment from this sushi aficionado."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place during a stroll and it was just what we needed on a hot Pittsburgh night.  The sushi was good and reasonably priced.  The restaurant is in a good location and is clean and new.  The staff was nice and very attentive.  I look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and great portions, plus they are BYOB!  Three dollars for a wine bucket and wineglass and a buck for a beer opener and we were in business.     We sampled the tempura oysters, four special rolls, and some eel sushi.   Way too much food for the two of us, but it was all tasty.  The oysters were the take it or leave it dish for me, but the sushi and maki stood up.   Next time, I would do the maki for two, which gets you two special rolls and two regular rolls for $37.95.   The portions are large, so half of that would be enough for me.     The server was prompt and friendly and there was no wait for a table on a Friday night.   A winner and we will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped at Ginza on a cold Friday night before a show. I was in the mood for some soup, so I figured I'd give this place a shot! It was pretty crowded when we walked in, but we were greeted right away and sat down. We didn't have much time so we glanced the menu quickly and ordered! I ordered the beef noodle soup and my girlfriend got Sushi. The broth was really tasty and all of the mixed veggies were delicious, but I wasn't a huge fan of the beef itself. It was a bit dry. Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere and would definitely go back and try something else as their menu is huge!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, my knowledge of sushi restaurants is very limited, but this place is a gem, no lie.   The sushi itself was excellent, The preparation wasn't quite as extravagant as some other people have experienced here, but I don't grade on flair, I grade on quality. The service wasn't nearly as bad as some reviews would have you think; it was on par with any other restaurant and we were treated well throughout.   I'll admit I was a little worried when I initially went in because it seemed a little TOO quiet, but then business started to pick up as the night went on.   We got the Ginza Roll, a Tuna Roll or some such, and a Sweet Potato Roll.   If you don't get the Sweet Potato roll, you are wrong. I am unabashedly judging you from the internet if you don't partake of the Ginza sweet potato roll. I don't care if you don't like sweet potato. It doesn't matter. Broaden your horizons and get one because it will blow your mind.   And then, the price! I don't know how they do it, but then again, who cares? I walked out of there for only like $32, and that would have been easily twice that any most other sushi places for the amount of food that we got at that level of quality."}
{"text":"We ordered Tako Yaki, Lobster Tempura, and Chicken Hibachi. The takoyaki was a little too soft. The interesting thing about lobster tempura was the wrap was not dry seaweed. It was Sakura pink! Chicken Hibachi was good. I like the chicken taste."}
{"text":"The reviews are accurate - this place is a MUST VISIT place!   First of all, the service was exceptional. Matt, our server, was extremely honest about items he recommended and did not recommend. We followed much of his advice and left in very happy moods!  The sushi was phenomenal! My favorite was the sweet potato tempura roll. It was different and delicious! Why go out and try a new restaurant if you're just going to order the same old thing?  My girlfriend's favorite roll was the Spicy Girl roll. It was full of flavor and not too spicy to the point where it was too hot to eat.  We also loved the Philadelphia Roll and Shrimp Tempura.  All in all, there was nothing not to like. It was delicious, clean, the staff was friendly, and it was BYOB!  I will B-YO-Back!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much, but the food is just delicious. Great value and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"I like this place. The prices are fine. Clean, friendly and roomy. The only thing I don't like is they seem to not have air conditioning."}
{"text":"Came here for the sushi and it was AWESOME. It's now my new best sushi in Pittsburgh. There were so many unique rolls, loaded with ingredients and reasonably priced. We came on a Saturday night and didn't need a reservation or anything. Best meal I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"After locking my keys inside my apartment I decided to head over to Ginza for a bite to eat.   Usually the service at Ginza is pretty solid but I don't know what happened? I was the only person their besides the server, MARGRET, and the  chef.   I had initially ordered the House Salad, Gyoza, and Sweet Potato Roll.   I was then brought out only my Gyoza which was fine but when the server repeated my order she said \"only two orders Gyoza and Sweet Potato Roll\" I quickly corrected and let her know that I wanted my House Salad which she said she would get but as she whisked her self away said that actually nevermind I didn't want the salad anymore and kept yelling it after she had went to the back hoping someone had heard me ...i guess not. I wasn't trying to be difficult but if it wasn't made the first time it wasn't a big deal not to have it. By the time she got back I had received my salad and told her that for the 9th time I said I no longer wanted it. She then looked at me with a \"are you serious right now\" look and walked away with salad in hand while saying something i couldn't understand.   While I was eating my Gyoza roll close to finishing the last bite my sweet potato roll arrived and the server then rushed to take away my Gyoza and I had to yell at her \"I'm still eating\". She then once again whisked herself away in what seemed to be annoyance. What did I do?   After finishing both dishes my glass of water was left empty and since I couldn't find anyone peered into the back and then quietly went back to my seat where she popped her head up from the front. She then refilled my glass then asked me cash or credit but I hadn't even seen my bill yet. I asked her if she could bring my check.  Terrible service with an overly pushy server. I do love the food here but personally they could hire better servers in my opinion.   Please keep in mind that this review is solely based mostly on the service here and not the food!"}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful time at Ginza and I can't wait to go back! The food was great, our service was friendly and timely and the price was right. This might be my new favorite sushi place! Also, this place is a BYOB! Woo!  Our server, Bin, took wonderful care of our 6 person table. He was courteous and very attentive to us. My boyfriend and I went for the Maki for two, which was the perfect amount for us--Two special rolls and two regular rolls. Let's us each pick our favorites and have some to share! We went for the Strongman roll, Rainbow roll, spicy salmon and California roll. That menu selection also comes with two soups or salads. With two miso soups, an additional seaweed salad and the 4 rolls, we were very satisfied and full after our meal! Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Hopped around town for a go-to for sushi and finally made time to try out Ginza.  My only regret is not coming sooner!  Ginza has good selection of fish and maki.  I tend to stay with simpler rolls and hand rolls - so to me, as long as quality is good..I'm happy.  My boyfriend loves the specialty rolls here.  For appetizers, we had the soup ($2) and calamari (very meaty!).  I like Ginza because it's good value for good sushi.  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I hesitate to tell people that this gem exists, but in fear of them closing because of lack of food culture, I feel so obligated to share the love.  People.... $8 at lunch buys you TWO sushi rolls and a salad or soup.   It's healthy!! It's fresh!! It's delicious! If you don't like the salt taste of your sushi then order it with soy paper for gods sake. Time to shed those pasta pounds Bloomfield.  GINZA IS AMAZING. LA sushi snob for 8 years, moving here you realize good sushi is farrrrr and few between.  This is the real deal.  Get some."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite place to get sushi in the city! It is well priced, and the size of the sushi pieces is just perfect. I get upset when one buys expensive sushi only to find that the rolls are absolutely tiny.   The restaurant itself is never incredibly busy, I think a lot of people decide to take-out. The dining area is clean and sleek. The owner is usually the one who greets you; she is very friendly and will recognize after only a few times of coming in.   I usually get the avocado roll and the sweet potato tempura roll. The sweet potato one is actually a bit bigger than the normal rolls and it has a special sauce drizzled over it. It is good with or without soy sauce. Order at lunch and you get a soup or salad. I love the dressing for the salad! The lettuce leaves a little to be desired.   Good food. Not much else to say! When I'm in the sushi mood, this is definitely the place I go to."}
{"text":"This is a very casual restaurant with nice food  We all ordered different dishes and all were good  As in this area only problem is parking  The prices are fair and the service is pretty good and kind  They try to be accommodating to your request  It was my daughter Bday and they brought dessert with a candle;) that was a nice touch  Fried ice cream desert is deli!  Good place we would be back ;))"}
{"text":"BEST kept secret in Pittsburgh!!! Rolls are big and packed with flavor. Fish is always fresh and delicious. Great quaint spot with wonderful employees. Me and my husband visit at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place still has consistently good sushi! I have moved neighborhoods now and tried a bunch of other places, but it's still my favorite in the city. I wish they had delivery!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Ginza one random night for sushi as we were looking for some new places to try.  We ended up ordering the Ginza Mountain and a Ginza roll. The Mountain was HUGE! Tons of fish in there. Everything seems pretty fresh to us, which is probably the most important factor with sushi. It was all pretty good, however, a lot of the menu includes tempura including the Spicy Yellowtail and Ginza roll. I have to say I'm not a big fan of that. If I want tempura, I'll get tempura separately. Otherwise the food was decent if not particularly inspired.  A couple of items to note:  This is a BYOB establishment, so plan accordingly (we didn't unfortunately). Interestingly, their spicy was not particularly spicy. I'm used to more spice than this, which was a little disappointing.   Overall this was a pretty good deal for sushi, so if money is a major factor, this is certainly a place to consider. However, I think there are other better places for sushi in the city."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Bloomfield! There aren't a ton of places in Pittsburgh that offer great specialty rolls, but this place was amazing. We ordered the maki for two, in which you get two regular maki rolls and two specialty rolls, as well as two soup or salads, all for only $37. Everything was delicious. Definitely will be coming back to try the other rolls, as well as the hibachi."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed by my experience ordering from Ginza. Today was my first time at Ginza, and I ordered the lunch roll special to go plus an appetizer. I wanted to try this place given its good reviews, but was let down. I ordered the 3 roll lunch special (california roll, tuna roll, salmon avocado roll) which comes with a soup or salad, and also ordered an age-tofu as an appetizer. My overall bill came to around $17-18.  I order age tofu at every \"Japanese\" restaurant I go to because it is a litmus test that reveals whether the restaurant knows its craft. The age-tofu today revealed to me the unfortunate truth: that Ginza is not worth the hype and that they don't really know what real age-tofu is. The age-tofu that I received looked like deep fried pieces of medium-firm tofu (real age-tofu is made with extra silken tofu), served with a spring roll dipping sauce. Real age-tofu is served with a shoyu sauce, drizzled over the tofu thus masking the fried texture.  The rolls from my lunch special - california, tuna, and salmon/avocado - were decent. Better than supermarket sushi, but really nothing to praise. The rolls here are at about the same level of craft as the ones at Oishi Bento in Oakland."}
{"text":"So so delicious, and they actually had toro and new style sashimi appetizers which in Pittsburgh, to my knowledge, only Umi has!!! The waiter was very knowledgable and kind and its BYOB whats not to love!!!"}
{"text":"Ginza is just what other reviewers say, delicious sushi at a price that will not make you feel guilty when the tiny rolls come out. I was skeptical when I saw the menu prices, thinking \"What's the catch?\"But, Ginza is the real deal, good sushi at an even better price.  I've gone for both lunch and dinner, and this place has some of the best sushi deals in town. For dinner, I recommend going with a friend and getting Marki for Two. At $37, the dinner is such a bargain for two, with 4 rolls and 2 soups or salads. My jaw nearly dropped to the floor when I realized how much food we were snagging.   The weekly lunch special is also a deal. You can get 2 or 3 rolls, with a soup or salad, for under $20. With these prices, you'd expect to be eating Giant Eagle sushi, but it's certainly several levels above that. The fish is fresh, and while the standard rolls can be a little \"blah\", the specialty rolls are fantastic. I lean towards spicy or crunchy rolls, and was satisfied with my choices. The spicy isn't too spicy, and the crunchy isn't overwhelming.  Ginza is also BYOB, making it a great casual dinner date spot. Considering the place is almost always empty, it'd probably make a great spot for a group dinner as well.   Judging by the proximity of Ginza to my front door, I know I will be back. There are certainly better sushi places in the city, but Ginza is close, affordable, and will always do the trick."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a delicious meal of fresh sushi with my family. The service was friendly and accommodating. The Naruto roll is refreshing and healthy. I highly recommend Ginza."}
{"text":"I recall watching the documentary film \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" (highly recommend for anyone wanting to learn a little more about sushi or about sushi master Jiro Ono himself) on Netflix a couple weeks ago and immediately realized that it had been months since I had some sushi.  The next day I purchased a LivingSocial deal for Ginza, and then the day after that my husband and I made dinner reservations and redeemed the deal.  The atmosphere was very relaxed, unpretentious.  Service was efficient and personable on a busy Friday evening, just the right mix of casual and professional.  There was a steady influx of new dine-in customers during the nearly 2 hours we spent at Ginza, a relatively small establishment, as well as a number of take-out customers who came and went.  The reason for our lengthy dinner was a large party that received all its orders ahead of us.  The server and manager handled the situation well though, apologizing for the busy sushi bar and bringing over a complimentarily heap of edamame to help pass the time.  Really loved the Ginza Roll and would order it again in a heartbeat.  Tuna Mountain was also very good, but next time--and there will be a next time--I think I'll pass on it in favor of a Rainbow Roll or a Dancing Eel.  I'm a big fan of eel rolls, and to be honest my terrific but eel-less dinner at Ginza still left me craving some eel.  The 2 simple rolls we chose as part of our \"Marki for Two\" order, a Yellowtail Roll and Boston Roll, were so-so; really simple rolls rarely wow me.  Western Pennsylvania obviously isn't exactly a sushi hot spot, but Ginza was satisfying indeed.  We were very pleased with our meal and the service here."}
{"text":"So good! Love this place and it's definitely in one of my All-Time Top 5 sushierias (made that up, feel free to use it ). I have not dined in for a very long time, but when I did, the BYOB aspect was great and the creative rolls were so good!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! BYOB is nice. Ginza roll is a must-have!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place out for take-out. I called ahead for an order and when I arrived it was already waiting for me. The place was completely empty other than me walking in and the people working there. I'm pretty sure it was because it was snowing and no one wanted to venture out.   I ordered two salmon ngiri sushi, spicy salmon roll, dragon roll, and gyoza. I grabbed my order and checked it out in the car. It looked so delicious and it definitely was when I finally got to try it. I was really satisfied with the size and freshness of my ngiri salmon and the spicy but not deathly spicy salmon roll. It was on the smaller side and perfect. The gyoza came with six pieces and a good size container of soy sauce. Everything had soy sauce on the side and I like this because some places give you one small container for your entire order. Not here! My dragon roll was different than what I'm used to seeing and tasting from a dragon roll, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. Each piece was covered with avocado slices and fresh all around. So freakin' good!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"More tests are needed, but I've been here at least twice, and never left disappointed. The service here is great - very attentive without being annoying. It is quite a small place though, so it's probably not hard.   If you're into salads... The Japanese ginger dressing is the s***. The iceberg lettuce you put it on is just meh. But the dressing - for real.   Miso soup. Pretty good. Opaque in color, and keeps you wondering what else is in there. I think for this reason it seems a little more substantial since it's not completely clear.   I've had the Ginza roll, which is freaking huge, and I also had to resist calling it the Yinza roll. I think it's about 12 pieces. It's got tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and Kani for the meats and among other things some delicious spicy mayo.   Besides sushi, they also have a nice selection of other rice, noodle, and hibachi dishes.   It is BYOB and I hit myself on the forehead every time I forget this before going.  My favorite thing is the cute little orange they give you at the end. It's the perfect ending."}
{"text":"Meh, not that different from every other sushi place.   There really isn't much to say other than it's affordable and there's a decent spread of sushi/asian platters."}
{"text":"We were searching for some good, inexpensive sushi around the area in Pittsburgh, and Ginza seems to meet those conditions. Fairly inexpensive, good ratio of rice/stuff inside the rolls. Our only complaint is that the miso soup was a bit bland (but not bad), and the shrimp tempura roll was a bit greasy."}
{"text":"My son and I popped in here on a whim, and were really pleasantly surprised. The sushi was really top notch for the price, and the service was prompt and extremely friendly. We had the \"spicy girl\" which was definitely our favorite, and another  one recommended by the staff--which was also delicious. We will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last night with a friend and had a great experience.  Although it was a Saturday night it wasn't too busy and we easily got a table.  They are open later for dinner until 11pm on weekends and we went around 10.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  We started with the seaweed salad and tuna tartare and both were excellent.  Then we split the sashimi deluxe and 3 of the rolls.  The sashimi was very fresh and included some more rare options, such as sea bass and fluke.  We were also impressed with all of the rolls, which had generous pieces of fish. We had the samurai roll which was topped with scorched scallops, the dragon roll and a spicy yellowtail roll.  The prices were also very reasonable.  It's hard to find good quality affordable sushi in Pittsburgh, so that is why this is getting 5 stars."}
{"text":"Over the past year I've been traveling all through the Mid West and East Coast on grad school visits/auditions and tested sushi all along the way. Of course, one of the best places I found was right in my backyard, this is probably the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Which is always why I'm confused when I visit and the place is empty? Maybe I always catch odd hours? Maybe people do take out? Not sure, either way, I don't mind the chill environment. We regularly get the Maki for 2 which comes with soup or salad, we almost always end up taking about a full roll home, the servings are generous! The miso soup is super delicious and piping hot when it hits your table. The service for the sushi is always speedy and beautiful, we haven't had a roll that we disliked. The fish tastes clean and fresh while the tempura rolls are crispy and light. Definitely recommend this little spot!"}
{"text":"Went for sushi and was not disappointed. Great cheese wontons, the price was very fair and awesome service! I would definitely try to make it back."}
{"text":"I am new to Pittsburgh and have been looking for good eat spots. I was pretty impressed with all of their food, we had both sushi and hibachi style entrées and all of it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls taste very good, definitely try Zen roll. And the fat tuna sashimi is my favorite. Also recommend Salmon tartar as appetizer."}
{"text":"banging asian food that is healthy, tasty  sans MSG.  They make some really unique sauces with their dishes I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Three days later and my neighbor is still texting me...\" I loved that sushi.\" Our friend and neighbor joined the BF and I at Ginza for dinner and IT. WAS. GREAT. Now, it was late on a Thursday, so it was empty, which may explain the speedy service but not the fantastic sushi. That was all Ginza. They have quite a few options and we ordered way too much, but it was so, so good. We started with salad and the ginger dressing was not what I remembered but was very good. It seemed thicker than last time I had it, but it was great none the less. The BF and I went with the Maki for two which lets you pick rolls and soup/salad for each. We also got two for the table to split as an appetizer. I can't remember all the ones we ordered but I know we got one called a handsome boy and one called Godzilla. I was astounded when they brought it out. It was a large platter filled with sushi and for $37 you cannot beat it. I cannot tell you what was in any of them, but they were all fantastic. Our neighbor got a platter, but I have no idea what was on his. We all shared and I got lost what was on each platter. As a side note, and this is going to sound strange, but their water was the best water I have had in a restaurant in forever. I even said so, which made the table regard me as an idiot, but after a sip Todd was shocked at how good it was. It was so crisp and refreshing! Try it; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are friendly, the atmosphere is comfortable. it is BYOB. the food is delicious and very reasonably priced. I get take out lunch from here at least once a week. they have a ton of vegan friendly options and never get the order wrong. such a go to and so glad it is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Finally a sushi place on liberty!  It used to be Hibachi Express but they remodeled and expanded their menu. It was an awesome place before and continues to be. Priced right with great food. I had a quick dinner with the chicken hibachi. For $10 I got enough food for 2 meals. It came with a salad, soup, container of fried rice, and a separate container of chicken and vegetables. No doubt in my mind this place is going to become a popular spot. Oh and it's BYOB. Give it a shot and you'll become a repeat customer like me."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Staff was more than friendly and had excellent suggestions. The menu is large, so it was.suggesred to us to order a combo of 2 special sushi rolls and 2 'regular' rolls, like spicy tuna/ salmon roll etc. Delicious. Not the fastest time to get the food, but the servers were prompt with the drinks and attentive."}
{"text":"I took my 13 year old sushi freak nephew there today and he loved it. Really good sushi."}
{"text":"Similar experience to many others. Great value for excellent but standard sushi. Fish quality and taste were excellent and rice was very good. Relaxed, neighborhood feel. This is my new everyday Sushi place. Aside from Umi and possibly Penn Ave Fish the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh in the 2.5 yr since I've moved here. If you like sushi, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Clean and with friendly service. Large menu which unfortunately includes mayo on the overwhelming majority of sushi is a huge miss for me which makes this barely 3 stars.  Also, their recipe for teriyaki tofu and vegetables:  10% broccoli, 20% tofu, 15% green peppers, and 55% sliced onions in a wonderful house-made sauce. No carrots, zucchini, or mushrooms. Odd."}
{"text":"I still like Ginza! I've now eaten here a few times and I really appreciate the kind, helpful service. When dining with a friend, they have some awesome deals on sushi combos to share. My friend and I had soup, salad and 3 rolls. It all came to about 25 bucks each (tip inclusive). The BYOB element with no fee is also a plus.  Worth a visit, for sure."}
{"text":"This place had some great rolls and some okay rolls. Thy are also BYOB and no wait to get a table. Overall I was satisfied and full. LOVED the strong man roll because I love soft shell crab and spicy tuna put together! Pretty disappointed with the spicy tuna roll because as I love me some spicy tuna, this just wasn't spicy. I had to ask for sriracha on the side. Also the harumaki, which are their veg spring rolls, were delicious! I would come back to try different rolls."}
{"text":"My go to for sushi  I love everything I've tried there so far, oh and it's BYOB! I always bring my out of town friends to Ginza if they're down for sushi. Good price, good atmosphere, good food, and good service. The only reason I didn't give a five stars is that they're kind of slow, but it really depends on the day. I went during the day once and they were fast. Anyway, my fav sushi place near me (:"}
{"text":"First visit and I'm not at all disappointed. I can't tell you how many times I walk by and just take for granted that it's there. \"I'll get there sometime\" kind of attitude. Jeez, I'm mad it took me so long. Sushi is just amazing and super fresh. And oh so affordable! Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"I'm branching out. it's truly unbelievable that I'd part from Penn Ave Fish Company. I mean, let's get real, I'll never stay away long but I've found a good option in Ginza. The truth is Ginza is cheaper and the rolls are larger. That's just it. Go big or go home.  So if you're craving good sushi at a great price with massive servings, this is your place! I really like that you can put together your own combinations with money saving prices. Between the two of us we split the Marki for Two for $33. It was two specialty rolls and two regular rolls. What a steal!  We ordered the Tuna Lover and Spicy Girl specialty rolls plus the tuna avocado and philly roll. On top of the rolls you also get soup and salad. I mean, geez. Keep piling on the food... and this was just for lunch! All the rolls were really fantastic, with the Tuna Lover being my favorite.   I can tell this is going to fit into the regular rotation of restaurants I'll frequent. I can't wait to come back and try the habachi meals too. Seriously, I could spend months ordering all the different menu options. Maybe I should just set up shop here for the winter. Not too bad for winter hibernation mode."}
{"text":"After years of using yelp religiously, I have finally decided that I must contribute to the community.   I went to Ginza in a group of five on a Saturday night around 10PM and it was empty - a little worrisome in my opinion, but we decided to stay anyway as we wanted to sake bomb. I'm glad we did.   We ordered miso soup, garden salad, tuna tartar, edamame, 4 plates of sashimi, a plate of sushi, tuna rolls, a specialty roll, and chicken and shrimp tempura.   The fish was all very good and fresh although the cuts were too thick for my liking. The salmon was particularly good for Pittsburgh. The (red) tuna was lackluster, but the albacore was delicious.   The tempura was both large and delicious. Some of the best shrimp tempura I have ever had.   The waiter was very attentive and overall the place was receptive of our group of loud individuals (albeit we were alone). Total price including corkage fee for both beer and sake was $106.   I recommend this place for anyone looking for good sushi and a good time at a great price. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place, manager is very sweet, very friendly, good food, fast service! Clean! with wifi. Accessible, easy to park."}
{"text":"Our server was excellent ! Food was  presented well, tasty and filling.How ever smaller portions than previous owners and no sweet carrots ;("}
{"text":"Quick attentive service and good food. Byob though, so remember your beer/wine, if you want a drink."}
{"text":"I love sushi, all kinds of sushi-as long as it's fresh. The miso soup was good. The futo maki and spicy girl rolls were good. The samurai, with seared scallops was not. The scallops were hardly seared and they were fishy. This is a standard Pittsburgh sushi roll restaurant. If you are looking for good sushi, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Pittsburgh and some of the best prices too. The tempura is also absolutely fantastic. I recommend Ginza 100%. Their service has also been punctual and friendly.   It always seems a bit empty though and I love eating there, so if you are considering Ginza please give it a try so it can stay around a long time!"}
{"text":"Sushi was very good, appetizers were a bit lackluster.  We had the potstickers and the seaweed salad apps.  The potstickers were the exact same ones that I buy in a huge bag at Costco, I'm 99% sure of it, down to the little packet of dipping sauce that comes with it.  The seaweed salad was good, but not amazing.  The sushi is where the magic is.  Not the absolute best I've had, but also far from the worst, and some of the best in Pittsburgh for sure.  The service was quick and attentive, but they certainly lack some of the table-side manner of other restaurants. They are all business - take your order, deliver your food, nothing more, nothing less.  That's fine by me.  They also have a nice BYOB option with a reasonable corkage fee.  I'll go back again (and have already) because their special sushi rolls are tasty, the portions generous, and the BYOB reasonably priced."}
