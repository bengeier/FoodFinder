{"text":"Went here tonight after finishing a round of golf at the accompanying course Sundridge Canyon. We sat at a table with a great view overlooking the golf course. Manager/Host, not quite sure, brought us out some menus and a busboy brought us some water. We sat and waited 15 minutes for a server to come take a drink order or simply acknowledge us. After 15 minutes I went and asked the same gentleman where our server is, he apologized, said its his fault, he sent our server home because they were overstaffed!! I'd beg to differ if they can't take a drink order within 20 minutes!! The place wasn't even half full. He said he'd send someone right over. We waited another 5 minutes as severs walked by us and continued to ignore us before we left. No effort on their part at all. Shame. I'll never return to this restaurant and suggest nobody else does either unless you want horribly slow service and no effort. Just a bunch of people standing around with no clue about customer service.  The golf course itself is amazing, great attentive staff, and I'll continue to play there. Just will never visit this poor excuse for a restaurant again."}
{"text":"Although the views are great, better than the views, the food was fantastic. Had the Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich and my wife had the Canyon Club. Outstanding!   Had our dogs on the patio. Staff was very friendly and loved meeting the dogs. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best atmosphere ever! Chef Matthew was totally entertaining and accommodating best food ever the meat was cooked to perfection! I highly recommend for great food and as stated before AMAZING ATMOSPHERE!   Cc\""}
{"text":"This place has so much possibility! The views are wonderful and the live music around the firepit makes for a great date night spot but this is the only reason I give an extra star (besides being in our neighborhood). The wait staff is not very attentive in our experience and we have tried this place out a few times over within the past few months. Service is very slow and last time we went our dinner order was forgotten about and we were never checked on after the first drink to see if we wanted another. Some date night, won't make that mistake again. Prior to that I had tried the almost $30.00 salmon to find it frozen and tough. For the prices their menu command they seriously need to step it up a notch, there are so many wonderful places to eat in town more reasonably priced and worth the price. I think an overhaul in the kitchen and management staff would be a good place to start, unprofessionalism, poor service and overpriced frozen fare doesn't equal staying power."}
{"text":"The food here was so good! We had a girls night here for the wine tasting on Wednesday and ate pizza made in the wood oven and a pitching wedge salad (cute and clever name for my favorite kind of salad served on a golf course). We came for the wine, but ended up having a fun night around the fire. The pizza was by far the best that we've had in AZ. (2 of us are from NYC, so we have high standards)  I was happy to find such good food in a causal place. There aren't enough places like this around. Just what I was looking for. Prices are very reasonable. I felt really comfortable here and can imagine spending a lot of time here. I love taking friends to a place they've never been.  When it's this good, it makes it easier on me to plan nights out. home run! Or should i say hole in one ;)"}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" at a country club has a common theme I've found in the entire area.  It \"appears\" to be a place that should have great food and great service.  It has a beautiful view with a fire pit outside that overlooks a mountain and a golf course.  As the old saying goes \"you can't put lipstick on a pig.\"  I have tried this place twice because it has such a nice atmosphere.  The first time with my parents and the service was slow and the staff was obnoxiously talking to a large table next to us which was undoubtedly a group of club members or regulars.  It is fine to interact with your regulars but not loudly so it imposes on the tables situated too close.    On the same trip, my mother ordered a basic chicken dish that was extremely undercooked and had to be sent back.  While the rest of us received our food, we had almost finished our meal completely before the fully cooked chicken dish had arrived back at the table.  Not enough apologies for a huge blunder on a basic cooking process.    The second trip featured an arrival just before 8PM which is apparently just before closing time.  What restaurant closes at 8PM especially during peak season?  The young, inexperienced waiters glared at us as we walked in making it more than obvious that we would not be welcomed if we dare walk through the door just before the late hour of 8PM.  This closing time is just unacceptable considering that a crappy chain would even stay open later than this!  The simple fact that a restaurant closes this early particularly in the heart of a busy season suggests that the owners simply don't care about targeting the correct demographic which would be one which spends money on a nice experience.  Either no one cares or no one wants to make money on completing the experience they think they will get when walking through the door and seeing an amazing mountain view over a golf course.  Anyone who gives this place a high rating is probably from a miserable place in the Midwest, tips poorly and has no idea about what good service looks like.  People from Iowa, Nebraska and the other flyover places just give places that should be nice many reasons not to care about food quality, convenient hours or professional service.  People pay a membership to belong to this country club??"}
{"text":"We went to the Wicked Six last weekend and were delighted with the service and the food. Absolutely delicious appetizer, delicious gourmet dinner and the dessert was the perfect finish to a fantastic meal. Our waitress was almost immediately table side and she was polite, personable and seemed to know the menu inside and out. We also had a great chat with the chef who gave me some great pointers on grilling vegetables!   This is a definite go to restaurant. Great value for the quality of the food served. We will be back again and again and will recommend the Wicked Six to all our friends!"}
{"text":"Wiked 6 is our new favorite date night. Dinner was amazing with excellent service.  After dinner we had cocktails outside where there was a fire pit, rockers, and live music. Such a hidden gem in Foutain Hills."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  We had our mother's 80th surprise party at Wicked Six.  Upon trying to decide what to serve Chef Matthew suggested a \"journey through the menu\". The food was 1st class as was the service and ambiance.  Chef Matthew came out interacted with the guest of honor and the other guests in our party as well.  The Wicked Six is far better than any other restaurant.  The chef is unbelievable! After dinner we sat outside and listened to the live music...here again no disappointment!  The entire evening was above and beyond our expectations thanks to Chef Matthew and the entire staff at Wicked Six!"}
{"text":"On a return visit my wife and I met a friend at 4 by the fire pit. Enjoyed some drinks, the great view some light food and good conversation. Something about a rocking chair that relax's you. Tried happy hour menu and shared 3 items, all very good. Service was not rushed but good. A very relaxing evening at Wicked Six Bar & Grill."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering bowl of chili unless you aren't really very hungry and don't mind throwing away $8. Bowl is so small I would hate to see what a cup would look like. We estimate that bowl held about 6 ounces. Didn't think to take photo until after the fact. The rest of our party (5) enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Great food, gluten free options, excellent service.. And a stunning view and great entertainment! We really love Wicked Six in Fountain Hills.."}
{"text":"Just had lunch today with a few of my girlfriends. I ordered the fish tacos and would not hesitate to order them again next time. I'm not much of a restaurant critic so I'll finish by saying the service was great and food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here, we were initially going to go to the Phoenician for Easter brunch but family invited us to dine at Wicked 6, and we accepted. They told us that last years Easter brunch was phenomenal, as was thanksgiving, but we were less than impressed. The chicken was dry, salmon was dry the vegetables were undercooked and the prime rib was just really sad. Service was so-so. It was a very underwhelming experience and was absolutely NOT worth the $130 we paid for 2 people. The folks who invited us were disappointed as well, stating that last years was so awesome but this years was such a disappointment. We most likely won't be back. Not to mention they automatically tacked on a 20% gratuity-which was not deserved. Our waitress was nice, but not nearly as attentive as we would have liked."}
{"text":"avoid horrible food bad service.owner is,stu#y,and rude way better places to go to in fountain hills"}
{"text":"A terrific choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner.... Great service.  Liz is totally awesome and Marilyn makes us feel like we are coming to a family dinner.  The Cork & Fork program is the best restaurant reward program I have ever heard of.....  Can't wait to attend the Clam Bake this coming weekend!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE!!  The food couldn't be better and the views are to die for. We came in for dinner last Friday and ordered the Tuna Poke to start and after our server Eugene suggested we ordered the ribeye and the pasta. His choices couldn't have been more perfect, the pasta portion was awesome and the flavor was out of this world and that was the best steak I've had in years...(i licked the plate!) While we were dinning the manager Ryan came to the table to check on us and we ended up chatting for fifteen minutes about everything exciting wicked six has planned, we cant wait to check out the Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Incredible food, service and of course views. Truly outshines any other restaurant in Fountain Hills, and can hold its own with any of the big boys in the valley."}
{"text":"Great location overlooking the 18th green and chipping practice area at Sun Ridge Canyon Golf Course.  Wednesday night they had wood burning oven pizza night and it was great - thin but soft Neapolitan style. Six medium sizes slices for $10.  Waiter could have been more attentive after we were served our Kahlua Pork Sandwich, never asked me if I wanted another beer or how it was then it took a while to get the check. He was very nice and attentive before that however. He said he was semi-retired so he must use the job as a way of keeping engaged and socializing.   The fries on the sandwich were just nearly under done and next time I would ask for them well done and crispy.  Lots of delicious sounding things on the menu we'd like to try."}
{"text":"My friend had a hair in her salad... not ideal but it happens. After telling the name dropping waitress she discounted my friends salad 20% and and gave her a glass of wine on the house... uh sorry we didn't want another glass of wine and it ended up sitting in the middle of the table untouched. Gross."}
{"text":"The Wicked 6 is an outstanding display of what bar food has evolved into!  With unexpected ingredients and flavor that jumps out from almost every dish it makes for a \"must stop\" when in the North Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area.  Don't let the location at sunridge canyon golf course fool you this is not your average \"golf club\" dining spot. With a bit of a rock and roll vibe this is a great place to bring the whole family any night of the week. They offer everything from bonfires, beanbag toss, ping pong, to full indoor and outdoor seating.   The atmosphere and ambiance enhance the overall dining experience with breathtaking views of four peaks and lower fountain hills. The Friday night bagpipe player who comes up the 18th green of the golf course is an experience all in itself that is a must see.   Great food, great service, great spot!"}
{"text":"I have given this place so many chances. Tonight I met my friends at 5, ordered drinks then food but we never got our dinners! People around us were seated later and got their meals,  but while we got drink re-fills, still no food. Got up from table and asked the waitress (who was now avoiding us) what was going on and she said she had asked the kitchen 3 times for our food. Still no dinner so we walked out at 6:35. Told the man at front desk about our experience and he asked where we sitting ( the pavilion) and he said  \" not my jurisdiction,  but sorry\" ! ??  I have had issues every time I have been here. The first time I brought clients here and called ahead for reservations and was told they didn't take them. When we arrived all the nice tables were reserved! Next I called for reservations and asked NOT to be seated in the pavilion. I was seated in the pavilion. Last Feb I went with family on a very chilly night that was very slow and the waiter just got lost and didn't bring our bill. We were freezing and wanted to leave. Had to track him down. He was shooting the sh*t in the kitchen and forgot about us.   This place has GORGEOUS views ( the reason for the 2 stars) and ok food,  but zero, zero management. I live here year round and this is ongoing. Not sure I will return at this point and I for sure will not bring a business client here. A real shame for such a beautiful spot"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome, Im writing a review while still at the dinner table. The wedge salad and the prime rib special was to LIVE for. Not to mention, they gave the birthday boy an excellent dessert. Will Definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We have a second home on Sunridge Canyon Golf Course and try to support the Wicked Grill whenever we can. View from patio is fantastic. Food is good, service is usually fair at best. We took our kids and grandkids for bagpipe night. It was very busy and we expected slower service but last night we didn't get any!  Servers all around us but not even eye contact for 15 minutes. Finally caught a server but she never came back. Complained to manager and Finally a server came over. 40 minutes time before a server took our order! Decided not to order dinner and left. Wait staff very poorly trained. Won't be going back this year. What an embarrassment!!"}
{"text":"The service here was so terrible. We had to ask to get drinks, food, and water. The food itself was pretty good. We had the nachos for an appetizer, which was stacked about a foot high.  The golf is great and the view is fantastic.  Our main food did not arrive together, which was a little confusing. The pizza arrived first, followed by soup 5 mins later and chips and salsa 10 mins after that. We canceled that."}
{"text":"This place was very nice and had BEAUTIFUL views. The food was delicious - we went for Easter brunch and it was a huge buffet. Everyone was very friendly.  Some critiques that need to be mentioned are as follows: -It took them 20 mins to figure out that they needed to  put a chair to a table outside (we had made a reservation for noon outside and didn't get sat until 12:25). It was not busy at all and it made no sense what-so-ever.  -Everything was very slow, which is ok if you have boatloads of time on your hands. Luckily we did today. I would not recommend coming if you want a quick lunch.  -they seemed understaffed, our server didn't come back to check on us, we had to get up to ask for iced tea/water refills and for the check. She had a completely different section that was far away from our table. It just was very disorganized for a really nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Gave it another try since I was notified that they had an IPA, however the food was terrible. My \"fork tender\" short ribs could barely be cut with a steak knife and were really fatty. Our dogs got all my meat but one bite. My husband's pork chop was literally raw in the middle.The only saving grace was that the vegetables were nicely done. I'm sorry but $29 is too much for a few Brussel sprouts and carrots though. Service was also poor. Rarely checked on us and forgot to bring the soup we ordered. We will not be returning, which is too bad since we live so close by."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Burger with mushroom and onion is....$20!!!!!  And we ordered medium but it's HARD, server didn't even give us water, and tried to take our food before we finished it...ordered old fashion, it was just SO BAD. Overall experience - It's NOT worth the price!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again, this time for dinner and had a pleasant evening out on the patio enjoying the view. Good service, very relaxing setting.   We started with the bruschetta. Very tasty, they do tend to fall apart if you're not careful so make sure you get it in your mouth and not your lap like I did :-/ Three pieces for $9 which I thought was a couple bucks too much (we got two orders so the three of us could each have a couple pieces, so $18).  I had the Pan Seared Salmon, $29. It was a very generous portion, in fact following the bruschetta (should have had just one!) I couldn't finish it. The fish was good, but not excellent as it was slightly overdone to my taste. Good though. However the sides were mind blowing. The fish was served on top of a generous portion of smoked cheddar grits with \"bacon lardons\" that was out of this world. Literally OMG. That and the charred brussels sprouts all went very well with the salmon, and the charring was done perfectly to coax maximum sweetness and flavor. Yum! Finished off with an apple cider reduction. Very very good.  My two guests both had the roasted chicken with potatoes and grilled veggies. It was very good and another generous portion.  Finished by splitting the brownie, another generous portion, served atop three tasty reductions.  All in all, we had a very nice dinner. I can't emphasize enough how beautiful and relaxing the outdoor dining is. Dinners are a little pricey but good and generous. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Their food is just wonderful. It is.  Brought my dad here last July for birthday lunch and dined on the patio which offered such nice views! It was warm that day (mid-July), but I recall a breeze which felt like a hairdryer on low setting blowing on me occasionally. I had their Cobb salad and they were portion-generous with all Cobb goodies!   Now, fast forward 6 months to this afternoon - my BFF and I called for take out and I had their Ahi Tuna Poke and wow... For $12, it was a lot of tuna chunks with diced avocado and cucumber mixed with dressing. So exquisite and mouth-watering. Was not disappointed! Also had bowl of AZ Tortilla Soup- very hearty and well-seasoned, but had a smoky, chipotle taste which I'm not the biggest fan.  Great service and decent prices here, Yelp peoples. Love their dining room tables and oversized chairs also.   Location is so ideal for me - maybe a 2 minute drive from my house??"}
{"text":"Wi wife a I go there a lot. Never been disappointed on the things we order.  The staff are so friendly to us that's we go back."}
{"text":"Lovely outside seating overlooking the golf course and mountains.  Service was great and our meals and salads were tasty.  Prices are a little on the high side, even for Fountain Hills, but we will definitely be back.  Small nit: It would have been nice to know that we could have taken advantage of happy hour specials, or at least have seen a happy hour menu.  The outside bar area is just as nice as the outside dining area.  We would have been happy to sit in the bar area but weren't given that option or even told about it."}
{"text":"Went back again for lunch today - this time took another girlfriend. This time I had the Chicken Club and it was super yummy! My girlfriend had another chicken sandwich of some sort, I don't recall the name, but she enjoyed it too. We were there to have girlfriend time and chat and the waitress was respectful of that. After we paid our bill, though, she did kind of just leave us - it would have been great to have been offered a refill on our sodas, but nothing. Had we been offered more soda we probably would have switched to adult beverages and hung around for awhile.  That is my only complaint, though. Food was terrific and the waitress was a sweetie. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Cory was very attentive and met our every dining need! The filet mignon and New York strip were excellent!"}
{"text":"Great views. Food just okay, nothing great or special. Many of their meals are very spicy. The soup , the coleslaw spicy  Also very overpriced food. $13.00 for a pastrami sandwich on regular bread with not alot of pastrami. Way overpriced food where the service is good but the food taste & quality needs lots of improvement.  Nothing to write home about. Go for the views & bring your own lunch. The food is not worth the price tag..."}
{"text":"Excellent patio & view. Great place to have a drink and unwind. There was live music while we were there and a huge firepit surrounded with rocking chairs! Perfect place to bring out of town guests and show off views of Four Peaks mountain. Also, got a Cobb salad for lunch which was very good, and big enough to share. I will be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Spectacular views.  Bagpipe player at Sunset - how cool is that?  Tasty sliders (but no chips, pickle or anything came with them - expensive - especially if you aren't lucky enough to be given the happy hour pricing).  Service...practically non-existent.  Arrived about 30 minutes before happy hour ended. It was moderately busy but by no means packed.  Many servers/staff were all around outside but no one made any move.  We stood there a while then just decided to find a table.  Saw the same scenario play out with 3 other tables' guests standing there, looking around and finally seating themselves too.  We waited and waited and waited...and waited still some more.  The old western music playing with tumbleweeds crossing your path kind of image comes to mind!  If it wasn't for the pre-summer perfect weather and location, we would have left long ago...  A busboy finally brought over some water so we asked him for menus.  He disappears.  More tumbleweeds.  Menus finally arrive - just plopped down.  No \"Can we get you something to drink?\" Or \"You're server will be right here.\" - guess he knew that wasn't going to be the case so why mislead us.  More tumbleweeds.  Numerous servers made eye contact, but not one bothered to acknowledge or come over.  We're dressed well and friendly!  What's the problem? 10 more minutes.  I REALLY just wanted to leave at this point.  Husband decided to get up and walk over to the bar to get a server...was told someone would be right over.  And again more tumbleweeds.  FINALLY someone comes to our table to ask us if we want to order a drink.  Oh and of course too late for Happy Hour after all this waiting.  Not our fault - but too bad so sad.  Drinks took a long time to arrive after ordering.  Ordered food - mistake because of more extended waiting. We should have paid attention to all of the obvious signs and just paid for the drinks and gone somewhere else.  We're all for un-rushed service when wanting an enjoyable relaxed evening out, but this level of lack of service from beginning to end took away any relaxed feeling.  And it's not a cheap place to walk away annoyed from (especially when they cause you to miss HR pricing - charging $50 for two drinks and two orders of sliders).  Where was the manager during the lack of service happening? Was the manager the woman sitting at/mostly walking around the bar with the name tag on but not seeming to do anything that whole time?    Wanted to love it because of the location/views, but the service made it an expensive, frustrating 1 star experience at best...gave 2 stars only because the facility/views are amazing despite the experience."}
{"text":"Great view and wonderful patio. Service was terrible, waitress did not write anything down, we had a table of 10 of us and she screwed everything up. Would only bring 1 drink at a time. Ordered food only 1/2 of it came out, waitress forgot to put order in for some of it. Food was mediocre. Best thing is the view. Would not eat there again, but would have drinks and hang out. They had an awesome acoustic guitar player there, a shame for him that service there was terrible. We saw 2 tables of people leave due to service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not the same since they changed it from the original. The prices are thus of a fine steakhouse, which this place is not! Great atmosphere with live music. The portion sizes are very large. They need to lower the prices and cut the portions in half at least! The food is good, but not worth the prices they are charging!"}
{"text":"I am always pleasantly surprised by how good the food is here at Wicked Six.  The service can be inconsistent, but the food makes you overlook that.   Last night we had the Ah Tuna Poke appetizer,  delicious as always!  The freshness of the tuna is complimented by avacado and an interesting balsamic sauce, then plated with an excellent mixed greens salad, won ton chips and a very tasty Wasabi sauce.  For the main course I had the Short Ribs and my wife had the Pizza Margarita.  The short ribs were beyond expectations,  cooked perfectly and served with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.   That may sound heavy, but the balance of flavors and textures along with an incredible sauce just pulled it all together and made it impossible to stop.  Resistance was futile, as they say. I wanted to lick the plate.  Seriously.   My wife's pizza was very good.  The crust is how it should be coming from a wood fired oven.  Nice crispness on the bottom, with just the right chewiness on the inside.  Again, good combination of flavors,  the cheese did not overwhelm the tomatoes and basil, and the balsamic reduction gave it a nice tangy finish.   Dessert was the brownie with ice cream, chocolate sauce and a berry glaze.  This is my favorite kind of dessert,  and Wicked Six does it right, even down to the mint leaf garnish.    The service can be improved,  we got our Poke before our wine made it to the table, and we had to ask for appetizer plates, which also took a while.  The staff seemed to really care however, and we could see that they made an effort to help each other out.  With the beautiful views and incredible food, we were able to overlook these minor shortcomings and enjoy a wonderful evening out.  Wicked Six is worth the drive, no matter where you are in the valley."}
{"text":"Amazing views, great staff, polite & friendly staff, superb customer service, awesome happy hour food & drink menu.  Live music. Fountain Hills' best kept secret, our town's little piece of heaven!!!!!"}
{"text":"What's happening?   Gave this place a 2nd chance and wow!  Customers are helping themselves to drinks, flatware, etc t quite entertaining and embarrassing!  The staff are sweet and trying really hard, it's management -and lack of proper training!   I heard them chatting between each other about the manager, not good!  We don't know who they are but they need to be replaced or trained cuz it's not even coming close!  Such a shame.....gold mine here.  Wanna a drink and view gorgeous landscapes and mountains  this is our place but  early before the \"after golf\" crowds and do NOT eat unless you have no clue then you'll like this probably.  Side note - pizza dough was uncooked sent back and they brought the same one back in the same condition!  Seriously?"}
{"text":"Very bad service, friendly but incompetent! The food was bad, for this price just ugly. We needed to ask for ordering drinks. This place is not recommended at all!"}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner this evening and very much enjoyed the excellent food, fine service, and great ambience.  But, we won't be back until the weather permits patio dining.  The problem is the very poor acoustics which makes table talk very difficult even with the dining room less than half full.  Everything in this large, high-ceiling room is hard scape so that sound carries from conversations at other tables, the bar, the kitchen, and echoes to produce a terribly loud and unpleasant background noise.  We were considering bringing a group of 20-30 for lunch in August, but  there is no way if we can't even talk among us.  Sure hope this gets fixed soon!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous views.  Good food. Friendly staff.  Excellent prices.  This is the perfect Happy Hour spot!  I wanted to stay and drink and stare at the views all day.  Three of us went for HH, and our food was excellent and would be 4 stars if it had been a touch less salty.  The drinks were relatively inexpensive, and even the bathrooms (both mens and ladies) were lovely!"}
{"text":"Food is blechh!  Kroger's frozen flatbread pizza is better than their \"oven-fired\" pizza.  The Wicked Chicken was dry and not good at all. It was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Five of us went on a Friday night for dinner, it was busy as you would expect, especially in season.  We ordered burgers and pizza.  The burgers arrived and then we were told the pizza oven was busy but it should be delivered soon.  Those that had burgers finished their meals and still no pizza.  The place now is almost empty.  Still waited several more minutes.  Finally it arrived and had a topping that was bad.  Just awful!  Manager came to our table and made it seemed like it was our fault for ordering pizza on Friday night because it's busy.  what???? She has not at all kind or apologetic."}
