{"text":"The name speaks for itself. Great smells from the place with straight forward items with unique twists (i.e. orchid latte). It's a must check out place."}
{"text":"Always nice coming to this Aroma
Service is quick and usually seating available
Love me the butter croissants!!!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for awhile now but always want to give businesses a break, not this time. This branch always has a slow service. The staff always seems to be lost and often messed up my order. It feels like a chaos every time i come here for that reason. Cashier sometimes take order then in the middle she decided not to and just makes the order, leaving a huge line up. I saw that happened twice. I often have to repeat my order because when I say I am allergic to raw tomatoes, it still appears in my take out order. I leave in the area for years now, even though this is the closest cafe to me, I rather take a 5 min walk to Yonge street just to get coffee because it is always a waste of time to come here. Oh by the way, I am still waiting for my americano while i write this review, I realized that the cashier forgot to take my name....so I have to check now."}
{"text":"Not up to par at this time. Poor customer service. 
Will stick to Don Mills location for now.
Usually enjoy Aroma, but not this new location:((("}
{"text":"Probably the best cafe to study in in this general area...no, definitely is. At least on the weekdays, during the day. On the weekends, forget even trying! This place gets absolutely crammed with families & old people taking a breather from their sluggish promenades around the circuit of the mall. 
Anyhow, during the weekdays it is far better to sit in here than in the Starbucks outside the mall, which is always slammed with ginos and ginas, or the starbucks inside the mall (which doesn't have seating...huh?). There's a wide variety of seating to choose from, benches, high tables, circular tables with comfy-looking swivel-armchair-type-things, or booths, which are personally my favourite. The only thing is, I'm not sure there are many power outlets in this cafe, in fact there may not be any whatsoever, but you'll have to double-check that...I think this cafe was opened mainly as a luncheon place for shoppers, and not as a sit-and-read spot. There is also much seating outside, with little tables. 
You have access either to aroma's wi-fi, or to the central Vaughan Mills wi-fi, both of which work well. 
I haven't tried the food at this particular Aroma, but from my experience with other Aromas, and from judging the amount of satisfaction reflected on others' faces as they consume the food, I presume it is quite tasty and fresh. 
The coffee is great!! The drip coffee is superb and dished out in generous sizes. The cappuccinos/lattes are also fairly decent, as good as one is going to get from a coffee chain. Quite superior to those brewed by Starbucks, Second Cup, Tim Hortons, etc etc. 

But actually my favourite thing is the machine by the door with the different smiley faces/frowning faces on it that you push on to determine your level of satisfaction."}
{"text":"I am not from the area, but come here once per week for another appointment. Usually I drop by at Aroma Espresso Bar. it's a vibrant place that delivers great coffee and quality food such as salads or sandwiches. I can just give four stars here. The only point of criticism is their bread that really, really s.... should be reconsidered."}
{"text":"Barely any outlets, no WiFi password posted anywhere, loud abnoxious music...not my favourite cafe to get work done. 

The food and coffee is good."}
{"text":"On going TTC construction has blocked off the front entrance, to enter go in though Rio Canada revolving door. They serve awesome coffees, which often accompanied by a small piece of chocolate, and/or small cookie. They also offer a good variety on their food menu with really good pastries. Free wifi and drinking water (with lemon) is a huge plus. Lots of tables and chairs to go around unlike some other location. Staffs are always friendly and welcoming. 
Great place to catch up with friends! :)"}
{"text":"Four stars for the takeout.  I've been getting lunch to go a couple of times a week and really enjoying it.  The salads are made to order [no onions, olives on the side, whatever], the portions are generous, and they are always fresh and tasty.  The bread is soooo good, the prices are reasonable, and the cheese danish was very much appreciated by my companion who'd said 'no salad for me'.  I have a friend who loves the mint tea, made with huge leaves of fresh mint; and another who swears by the extra chocolatey hot chocolate, which you are advised to stir before drinking because that thick chocolate sinks to the bottom. The staff has always been upbeat and helpful, the little squares of chocolate that come with your coffee are a nice bonus,  and I gotta say - I like it."}
{"text":"I always like their salads, coffees and sandwiches. Specially salmon sandwich is very good but I just have been  at the Eaton centre and I had the quinoa salad. When I got just a bit I had a strong taste of onions because those were spoiled  I told them they said that they can be change with another salad but they were already little bit sad for helping me cause it was about to closing time but they were still open so it was a bad experience..."}
{"text":"Drinks are really good but the lunch I had was next to tasteless. I ordered roasted red pepper soup that tasted like hot water, chopped salad where the dressing was also like water and bread that was a tad dry. I had to add 2 packets each of salt and pepper to the soup, and they didn't even bother straining the water from the tomatoes, so the bottom 1/4 of the salad is pretty soggy.

I gave it 3 stars is bc of their drinks and their service, which has been excellent every time I went."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic drinks. The hot chocolate is so good, the cappuccino is great, and the shakshuka is an excellent meal. Freshly made bread is an added bonus (go for the multigrain). The people who work there are very friendly. It can get very busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great service and even greater food!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service from some of the staff is absolutely abhorrent.

This is specific to two cashiers:

I had a cashier reply to my order: \"sorry can you repeat the whole order I was zoning out\" really?! My order wasn't long and I wasn't speaking fast. Even after an excruciatingly slowed down reiteration of my order, he asked me to repeat it again. This time his reason was that he zoned out...again. I get that it might have been 5pm in the day but do your job...

Another cashier a week later misquoted the price of my order and charged me 3 dollars more than what the bill had said.  When I asked her about it she threw a fit and said I was charged correctly. I showed her my bill and she just grabbed a pile of change and threw it on my tray."}
{"text":"Turkey Bacon, egg & cheese croissant was very good as was the Aroma Special salad. Salad was great actually! Very fresh food, wifi and good tunes:) Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a green tea fanatic and I have to admit that green tea is terrible here. Granted, I haven't tried any other teas here, but the green tea barely tastes like anything! If I had to describe it, it just tasted like very mild rice water - due to the fact that rice mixed in was overpowering the actual tea leaves. The second time I ordered, I asked for two thirds of the water and it still tasted like nothing. Definitely not worth the expensive price. I really cannot give more than two stars just because of this - it was that bad.

Other than that, their coffee was decent and it has a nice modern interior. It also seems like they have quite a few healthy selections with their salads and meals. Most staff seemed to be pretty accommodating and nice."}
{"text":"The food was good but terrible service, don't think I will be going back. They didn't put dressing on my salad and they forgot the bread that was supposed to accompany it. Also! this isn't there fault but someone stole my coffee from the counter. Overall not a very good experience but they do have a lovely patio."}
{"text":"I drive into the Rutherford Marketplace pretty often and have always wanted to try Aroma Espresso Bar - it looked like a good alternative to Starbucks and the patio is always packed on a sunny day or warm evening. I finally got a chance to try it out last week. The atmosphere of this cafe is very hip and trendy with its black/red/white decor and comfy booths. The place looked very clean which I liked.

I went up to the counter and was greeted by a friendly barista and a display of delicious baked goods. I ordered a hot mocha coffee and opted to enjoy it at the cafe (they give you an option for you to take it to go). I had to practice a lot of self control to resist ordering an almond croissant or any of their other baked treats but those are something I'll be returning for! I spoke to one of the regulars at the cafe and he said that the baked goods at Aroma are decent. In fact, I saw some danishes coming out fresh from the oven! 

Once the drink is ready, the barista called my name through their PA system. The mocha coffee I had was delicious - it was espresso, milk (lactose free for me), and chocolate praline which were chunks of chocolate that you stir into the drink. The coffee came with a complimentary piece of Aroma chocolate which was a nice touch. Aroma also has free wi-fi so I was able to enjoy my coffee while doing a few hours worth of work. There is also a cool water stand by the counter which you can help yourself to a cup of water.

Overall, a great spot in the area! They also offer a whole variety of sandwiches, salads, yogurt...etc which looked absolutely delicious (and a good portion size too!) I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been gross, even their coffee drinks. Scratch that, I guess their mango juice was decent. The place is often crowded with little seating offered. The lighting isn't great either--I'd rather not have all that sunlight in my face."}
{"text":"I went in after a work department lunch to grab 3 coffees including one medium black coffee, one medium americano and one small cappucino with skim milk. The cashier was extremely nice but the barista was terrible. He advised the cashier that she hadn't charged me for one of the coffees. She confirmed she did but he insisted that she had not. So I gave my card back so they could charge me for the third coffee without a problem. Once she charged me again, she looked at the receipt and realized she had indeed charged me already for the coffee. The barista then told her he would take care of reimbursing me. He started taking out change and I told him I had paid by card and should therefore be reimbursed by card. He said \"no I can't reimburse you by card\". I let it go and took the change.

He then took 20 minutes to make the two specialty coffees even though there was absolutely no one ahead of me. He kept referring back to the receipt where the drinks were written to check what the order was. However, when he was done the first drink he called out was \"one small latte\". I told him I had actually ordered a CAPPUCINO to which all he said was \"well it's the same thing anyway\".  I found this extremely rude, not to mention that it is absolutely not the same beverage. He also never offered to make the correct drink that I ASKED for. He just told me it was the same drink and pushed it towards me to take it. My boss who had pulled the car around actually came into the restaurant to see if everything was okay because it took about 25 minutes all in all for this whole ordeal. I didn't have time to go back and forth and ask for a Cappucino but this should have been offered as soon as he realized he made a mistake. I didn't ask for a latte, so the correct drink should be made and given to me. Maybe even an apology would have helped. Awful."}
{"text":"I come here every day as I work in the building. The coffee is great and the addition of a little chocolate with it is nice. Be careful with the pastries thou, once I got one that was frozen inside and another time one that was half-baked (raw dough inside).
Great bread and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I went this place several times and coffee tastes good but honestly the place is so loud and the service is terrible. My coffee took more than 10minutes because they missed? my order for some reason, without saying sorry. I had to say what I ordered three times (first when I order, second when my coffee was missed, third they gave me regular size when I asked for large one)."}
{"text":"The drink was great. I like my berry berry(iced tea) had to wait in line.  Service was nice. The tables are a bit dirty and so the floor."}
{"text":"For lunch, I ordered a combo portobello sandwich and red lentil soup. Soup was tasty with lots of veggies and lentils. Sandwich was quite good too, with extremely fresh soft brown bread, feta, and alfalfa sprouts! The total came to a reasonable $10 dollars including tax (without a drink). 

Aroma Espresso Bar has a very modern--if stark--vibe with patrons that look like mostly student-types with a slight corporate bent (probably from the Ryerson management school across the street). The space is clean with lots of seating. The menu is expected café fare: they serve coffee, espresso, smoothies, breakfast, sandwiches, soup, and salad. Also, they have gluten-free bread for sandwiches which is always a plus. Staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. Overall, a pleasant healthy option for lunch. Do go!"}
{"text":"This place has plenty of seating so while I've never had an issue finding a seat, I suspect that I've been lucky as this place is steadily busy. This isn't your quiet cafe to study or read but more so a place to catch up with friends.
Service is efficient and they call out your name when your order is ready so you don't have to idly wait around by the counter. 
Good coffee and tea. Love the little chocolates they give with every drink order. Note - don't put it too close to your drink or rest it on top of your to go cup because it'll melt. 
Their Alfajores cookies (coconut sprinkled sugar cookie sandwich with a dulce de leche spread in the middle) are great - not overwhelmingly sweet."}
{"text":"I ordered a large americano and the guy they had there must not know how to brew espresso.  The coffee was weak and it was evident that the espresso wasn't brewed / prepared properly.  I felt like hopping over the counter to do it myself. Not worth what I payed for."}
{"text":"Since this location has opened we've had what can only be described as an up and down experience. At first this was an exciting alternative to the several Second Cups and Starbucks in the area. Despite the name Aroma Espresso, the star attraction is definitely not the espresso drinks but instead their selection of food. The espresso drinks are inconsistent at the best of times and downright awful at the worst of times. Considering the wonderful experience I've had with local brands of a similar size in Vancouver such as Caffe Artigiano, Waves and Blenz it's sad to see a Toronto company can not compete in terms of drink quality.

The star for aroma is the food. Their croissants and pastries are fantastic, assuming they have baked them. Do not expect to show up to this location at the time they have posted on the door as open and expect to be able to get a pastry. No you have to wait at least a half hour to 45 minutes for the full selection to be available. And if you want to go late at night around say 730 or 8 to get a sandwich, there is a possibility they will have randomly closed their kitchen. 

To make matters worse they as of this weekend they are not opening until 9am which for those paying attention means that they are not likely to have the full selection of pastries and food available until 930 or 945. A coffee shop that has no pastries until 930 in the morning? Pathetic.

Bringing up that west coast comparison again, Caffe Artigiano, the company that realistically spearheaded latte art in this country but also has a wide selection of food, has 7 of their 8 Vancouver locations open before 8 on weekends."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Toronto after spending 3 years in Tel Aviv, and was craving a 'cafe afuke' - roughly translated from Hebrew to 'upside down coffee'. I have ordered almost every kind of coffee in starbucks trying to replicate this with no success. When I heard there was an Aroma down the street from my apt I couldn't get their fast enough (Aroma is the Israeli version of Starbucks/Tim Hortons). I must have resembled Road Runner on my way down Yonge St - anyway to put it lightly I was pretty excited - and they didn't disappoint.

It took me a while to explain to the young Australian manning the till what kind of coffee I wanted (it's not actually listed on the menu), together we decided it was like a cappuccino, but with less foam. He sent me over to the barista who went above and beyond asking me how much milk i wanted in it, and pouring the milk into the coffee while i watched so i could say 'when'. It was PERFECT!!! I combined it with a bourekas (a cheese filled pastry thing) and almost felt like I was back in Tel Aviv."}
{"text":"Never having been a merciless captive of coffee and it's miraculous effects in the morning, grabbing a cup of java isn't automatically programmed into my morning routine. And yet, I have made the long trek to Aroma more than just a couple times. 

That's not to say I don't occasionally order the latte or hot chocolate, but just that when it comes to coffee houses, it's not about the caffeine, rather how it tastes actually makes huge difference. That being said, I absolutely love love love the beverages here. My coworker loves the drip coffee, and I have fallen head over heels for the Mocha. The espresso isn't too heavy, and they add real chunks chocolate instead of the typical powdered cocoa, so make sure you stir well! 

And my admiration for this place doesn't stop at the beverages. Can anyone say freshly baked pastries? The smell when they're baking their chocolate chip cookies or butter croissants in the oven will pretty much banish all of my dietary discipline. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've tried the Aroma Special salad but the first time having it at this location. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it or not but about 45 minutes after eating it is started getting very sick to my stomach. For the next 2 hours I was at the washroom and throwing everything back up. Felt like I had the flu. I almost went to the hospital afraid it would keep getting worse. Thankfully, it eventually subsided. I have a feeling I caught a type of E. Coli."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee bar - the food and the coffee is very nice and they have an excellent patio for the warm weather. You always get a little chocolate with your coffee! The best part is the staff go out of their way to remember your name and your favourites. Once I hadn't been in for 6 months and they still remembered me ! I recommend this !"}
{"text":"Finally!  A place that not only serves good coffee (with complimentary, tasty chocolate), but delicious sandwiches and salads.  

I do find it very busy most of the time, so on occasion I have had to make my order \"take out\" because my friends and I couldn't find a place to sit.  I am happy they came to Toronto and will continue to enjoy those tasty little cheese danish."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Very poor wifi. Very bad choice for ppl want to hangout with their laptop. :("}
{"text":"Positive points for the variety of milks and good choice of drink options.  Coffee was pretty good.  Negative points for staff not knowing the ingredients in their drinks and overall poor customer service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Sandwiches are awesome. The reason for coming here the ICE AROMA FLOAT. Is to die for! The staff is always friendly and happy to serve you! They always give you a mini chocolate with it! Awesome place to go to with friends or family! :)"}
{"text":"Mocha latte is awesome, but miss my old fling orchid latte. That was a unique beauty. It's always my first love. Oh orchid beauty where are thou in thy menu?"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, predictable. Aroma is your run of the mill cafe. But what they do, they do well. This location was, as I mentioned, clean, fast and predictable. I loved how they put a \"D\" in my milk foam to denote that it was decaf vs my friend's regular cafe au lait. I always love going to Aroma Cafe, and this location was straight to the point and fast. Lovely customer service despite the fact that they were busy."}
{"text":"I have tried most of the Toronto locations and think it's great that they have gluten-free and vegetarian options. 

PROS: 

Good mix of options for people who need gluten-free, vegetarian, healthy, not too many things going on (in terms of ingredients)
Generally good staff, though have run into a few who don't know the menu very well.


CONS: 

Don't like the brand of gluten-free bread they use (O'Doughs) - there is better you can get in Toronto
Not the best value for self-serve
Not a fan of the coffee 
Do find the expresso-based drinks pricey  - even more then Starbucks 
The bar chairs are extremely uncomfortable - I can't imagine an elderly person trying to get up there....
The menu in the resto at the top is very  hard to read - don't know why they even bother
For some reason the gluten free bread makes the wait so much longer!!! Even when it just means they are toasting frozen bread (and many times it's still frozen). 


Due to the gluten-free options, I continue to go there if I have time to wait, but do think it is a tad overpriced...
and I've never eaten anything there that I couldn't make myself...."}
{"text":"Modern and chic ambiance with a sophisticated crowd. The service, however, is not in line with the decor and you have to wait in very long lineups (especially around lunch time) until your name gets announced!

Overall, a great spot with lots of healthy choices for a light meal

The pastry is nice and fresh and the variety is decent."}
{"text":"We went there for the hot chocolate but we were not impressed. However, the alfajores were good even though they could have been fresher. Service was not very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is good as with all the locations. I do like the seating at this location as there is also seating in the building lobby. It's great if your meeting with people and don't want your conversation over heard."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst expensive hot chocolate I've ever had. I got it to-go, and was wondering why it wasn't all that chocolate-y.... and then when I got home and opened it up, I realized it was because literally all of the chocolate was sitting in a goopy mess on the bottom of the cup with just steamed milk on top. I'm really confused as to how a hot chocolate made with the espresso machine could have turned out like this. I tried mixing it myself and it didn't blend. I've had coffee here before and it's been pretty good, but if you can't make a good hot chocolate you're not good in my book."}
{"text":"This Aroma just opened up near the Waterfront in between the ferry terminal and Harbourfront. Huge patio facing the street."}
{"text":"The definition of a cafe designed to serve a crowd. Their wireless does not work for Macs, and the service is frustratingly slow. I would recommend even Starbucks as an alternative option."}
{"text":"I have to say I think their actual espresso and coffee is decent but here's the rub- their food is awful, and really over priced. I've had almost everything on the menu ( I work across the street), and it's mostly dry, tasteless and often takes awhile to prepare. i went there for lunch on my break today (I only get half an hour) I ordered a sandwich which took 20 minutes to prepare- and when delivered to me, was, literally a bunch of canned tuna piled onto two dry slices of bread...tasteless and way under-seasoned food...I've also had their quinoa salad which is a sad excuse for a healthy entree...seriously...nice people and nice atmosphere, but the food does not at all live up to its promises. AVOID for any substantial meal, and just go for coffee"}
{"text":"A regular haunt of mine. Great chill vibe, friendly fun staff, and the coffee couldn't be better. Food selections are a cut above considering it's just a coffee shop.

Baristas call out your given name on loudspeaker so be sure to come up with a stupid fake name for everyone's amusement. 

Free Wi-Fi is a definite crowd draw. Tip: the \"linksys\" network is actually faster and more reliable than Aroma's network."}
{"text":"They have the best whole-wheat bread. Where can I buy a loaf???

So happy that they now introduced a LARGE sized iced drinks! =) 

Excellent foods all around. Sorry Starbucks, Aroma has taken my business."}
{"text":"Slow service coupled with food poisoning made my last visit the worst. The front staff taking orders does not seem very competent or friendly either. I would not trust their quality of food anymore and do not plan to return. What a shame. It's in such a good/big location at the mall too."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience of my life. 

The man working behind the counter at cash, after I ordered, asked me \"can I have a name?\" but I couldn't hear him over the whirr of the coffee grinders so I said \"cash\", to which he barked back \"CAN I HAVE A NAME!?\". Absolutely appalling. You cannot speak to customers that way. And if you want to offer personalized service by asking people's names, say can I have YOUR name please... not just \"a\" name. 

When I asked for the wifi password, the worker behind the counter begrudgingly gave it to me. 

The staff were saying terrible things about customers in front of all the customers. Service is really deplorable."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, especially the selection of pastries. Please try the cheese Danish when you go! The atmosphere is laid back and the size of this location is pretty good. One suggestion I have is to change the ordering system. When I was called to get my food half of my order was already taken by someone else. The guy making the food told me that I had just picked up the other part, which I was really confused about, but when I told him no, there is nothing at my table he just proceeded to make me another sandwich and coffees without a fight. This bad experience actually turned into a positive since I really regretted not getting my latte iced (it was a really hot day), and because of the thief who stole half my order I was able to get iced after all. Despite the victory on my part, I still think that maybe customers can be given a ticket or a number??

Great place to have a coffee, bad ordering system, a bit overpriced, but pretty yummy."}
{"text":"Food OK.  Ambiance nice but not enough space.  Service is a disaster.  We were in line, before the store closed.  The cook came out and yelled at the embarrassed girl that he is no longer cooking... Pointed my son and I and said \"we are not serving you.. Closed\"... I was in line.. Before 10...

What management.  It's the second time I have gone there and second time I had poor service."}
{"text":"Perfect for Sunday brunch! 

The bureka treat is my fav for a snack, and power breakfast is my go to for a full meal! 

Love the balsamic vinegar that comes with the salad, and their bread is sooo good. I usually avoid bread, but theirs is impossible not to nibble on."}
{"text":"Located On Bathurst and Wilson.
Great atmosphere and awesome coffee. The staff is friendly. As for the salads and sandwiches selection they are healthy and tasty :) and to top it all off its KOSHER! :)))"}
{"text":"Yeah, NO! Coffee was OK, but the system is not at all streamlined. When my Americano was finally ready, a barista screamed out my name...really embarassing. Apart from that moment of gusto, staff was just plain bored and not friendly at all. (Sorry you had to be there guys.) Room is in no way inviting, dark and dingy. Wouldn't dream of eating there."}
{"text":"love this spot- excellent espresso and food- branding is fantastic and the place is hip-worth a visit"}
{"text":"Lecker Smoothies und Tee. Sehr große Auswahl an Kaffees, Sandwiches und Salaten, die auch als Combo zu kaufen sind. Sehr freundlicher Service. 
Heller, freundlicher Raum. Stabiles und schnelles WLAN. Ich würde das Café auf alle Fälle weiter empfehlen."}
{"text":"I really like it here. Food and drinks are a bit overpriced, but the place is quite spacious and quiet enough to study or concentrate on conversation! Workers are also friendly but I want they open longer  It closes too early and it closes on every sunday"}
{"text":"We love the Aroma chain but this location is terrible. The front staff does not know the food items they sell. She kept insisting that an item does not even exist on the menu. I said look back on the menu board. Then again for another item. The bigger issue is the attitude with which it was done as if it was my fault to order those items."}
{"text":"So excited when this location opened near my work. Just got a salad. Paid with a 10 dollar bill, got a few small coins back for change. The whole cold mess went in the garbage. Waste. Tasted funny and at its essence just a whole bunch of cucumber and tomato. Not a threat to the other less than fresh joints around.  Blah, WHY?"}
{"text":"The barista was verbally abusive and openly disrespectful and you could tell that it was an uncomfortable experience for all the other staff and customers that were involved. I was really disappointed to see the way the barista was treating the rest of staff. The coffee and the snacks are passable - what is expected from an aroma location, but the customer experience will never exceed the employee experience."}
{"text":"Have came here a few times to grab coffee, or coffee and a snack. 

Not really designed to sit and chat the afternoon away with friends, so if you are looking for that kind of atmosphere I would choose somewhere else to go. They do have free wifi and there are both indoor and outdoor seating options. It has always been immaculate when I've come in here, which is a big selling point to me. 

We've only had pastries/muffins so far and they are tasty but a little pricey. Much better quality then some of your typical, cheaper chains. 

Coffee has been good so far - we have not tried any other drink options."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience in my life. Stood in line for ten minutes while the cashier chatted up some girls, so I thought we'd sit at the bar and order since no one was sitting there and the guy behind the bar was standing there doing nothing. He sees us leave the line and sit down, he turns around and starts wiping the bar. I wait for five minutes and finally ask him if we can order some coffee. He turns around and says \"get in line\". I told him we were already in the line and now there's ten more people behind the two girls who are still talking to the cashier. He says \"not my problem\". Smarmy a**hole. I left and will never step inside that place again."}
{"text":"I love their food, but this place ALWAYS screws up my order - if you're getting food to go from here, make sure you check what they give you to make sure it's what you ordered and that everything is there. I don't know if this is just negligence from one of their staff members, but it has happened to me at least five times now."}
{"text":"The girl named Wendy was so rude and cold. I greeted her as a customer with a smile and she had such attitude. The other saff were great however Wendy was rude and had ridiculous amount of attitude."}
{"text":"There are many things I like about this location, but unfortunately there are also a few things that spoil many of my visits.

The food and coffee are great. The patio is great. Some of the staff are fantastic. There is a cashier and a busser who have been there a long time and are exemplary employees.

It is the baristas who frequently ruin the experience here. Often you will find the barista chatting with staff at the counter or watching the tv, while apparently oblivious to all the people waiting for their coffees. Sometimes the wait time is perfectly fine; but far too often one is left standing for 5 minutes before the barista even realizes there are orders.

Update: Go back today and exact same thing happens. Zero people ordering except for me, and the barista just stand there staring at the tv for a full 5 minutes. The cashier sees me still waiting and asks her about my drink. The barista mumbles and scowling the whole time finally makes my drink. Frowning, she plops it on the counter and goes back to the tv. Worst cappuccino I have had in years. Zero foam and could barely taste any coffee."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here at least once a week.  My favourite is their French Toast  and Shakshuka but I love all their food.   The staff are also nice.   Unfortunately, it can get busy especially on weekends.  

The place offers free WIFI which tells the kind of clientele they have.  The food is a bit expensive but I do not mind paying extra for good quality food.  Fact is, we live in the modern world of technology and I support restaurants who are accommodating the needs of their clients.

On the side, owner needs to ensure that tables are cleaned promptly as oftentimes, especially during busy hours, dirty tables are left uncleaned."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere there. I have been to a few different locations so far...Bloor, Donmills and even one in Berlin, Germany. 
They have free water which quench your thirst, so you can still enjoy a nice hot coffee even in the hottest day. I also enjoy the personal touch that you get, they ask for your name and gives you a piece of chocolate with your coffee."}
{"text":"*BEWARE 0 STARS-PARTICULARLY IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES*
I called the restaurant when I had taken 2 bites of my sandwich and realized it wasn't what I ordered today. I spoke with the manager (Marina Shev) and clarified I had received a chicken sandwich with sauce instead of the portobello sandwich on gluten free crust (with the note \"gluten allergy\" on my order); the former sandwich has gluten ingredients (even though she is unaware of the ingredients that have gluten in them - yikes!). Initially she was trying to argue I had picked up the wrong order. She said she would give me a refund and have a new/correct sandwich made and ready for when I come in; I was to return with the incorrect sandwich (not what I ordered) and to show that I had the receipt for anothet order (also validating that I had picked up the right order - umm duh!!).

I return to the restaurant and show them the incorrect sandwich and the new sandwich has not been prepared. Staff here are always miserable and today is no exception. The manager is also running around, avoiding me, and not managing resolution of this in a timely manner (which is ridiculous as I had spent 15 minutes on the phone with her before I returned to restaurant so thought everything would be ready and taken care of but end up spending another 30+ minutes trying to resolve this - which I don't have time for. I have a meeting at 2pm so the manager says she will file an incident report (which I have doubts she will do). 

When a person indicates an allergy (I say allergy even though I have celiac disease - allergy usually resonates better at restaurants) and is then given something they didn't order with gluten in it, it has serious implications (short term, I'm throwing up and GI issues and serious long term consequences, possibly developing cancer and having other gastrointestinal tract issues, to name a few).

I indicate I am very upset by this as I know the reaction I'm going to have a few hours later - and reinforce the message that when a customer indicates they have an allergy (more) specific attention should be paid (even though all orders should have good quality attached to them). The manager doesn't seem to understand this and says they had a BUSY lunchtime rush - ridiculous and not a valid excuse!!! It is a blatant disregard for someone's health and complete incompetence/negligence. Serious customer experience issue and no value for what you pay - my health is my #1 priority and there was no concern, apology or management of this. 

This is not the 1st time I've had an issue at this restaurant and had indicated so; needless to say I WON'T EVER be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered an almond croissant - what a disappointment. Instead of a proper marzipan filling, it was sliced open an slathered with some kind of vaguely almond-flavoured custardy mess - resulting in soggy pastry. For almost $5 (!) I expected much, much better.

Please note that I did not try anything else there - but I would avoid the pastries. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like aroma a lot more now that I can get it downtown in the new food market in eaton centre.  they make de-lish coffees, the signature aroma coffee is my favorite. it has a chocolote melted in the bottom,, and i usually save that for a after coffee treat, as it heavenly"}
{"text":"Service can be slow and some workers are not friendly. Drinks are great food is mediocre."}
{"text":"The problem I have with this place is every time I order a sandwich/food at this particular location it takes over 20mins to make without the staff informing you of why. This morning was no different. I ordered and egg and cheese croissant at 7:45am. There wasn't anyone else in there who ordered food. By the 20min mark I finally asked what was going on. Then and only then did the cashier say. He's making it now. When I further inquired why it was taking so long as it was just a fried egg with cheese she then proceeded to say there's a problem with the grill. This is something she should have told me when it happened or at least before 20mins. I could have then had the choice of canceling my order. Not when I asked. I was clearly waiting as I kept looking for my order. Then instead of calling my name or order when it was finally ready she just dropped it on the counter in a crumpled up bag while my back was turned. I happen to turn and notice it there. Sad thing about this location is that it's right next door to TGH where the majority of us do not have over 20min to wait for an order. Honestly I don't think anyone really has that kind of time even if it's your off day. The worst part about waiting so long is that my egg wasn't even hot. I had to re-warm it. I won't be ordering food from this location again.  I would rather cross the street and order from the the one in Mount Sinai Hospital. Much better service!!! Aroma MaRS building; you need to do much better"}
{"text":"Apparently I just like places called Aroma. Big big fan of this coffee shop, their Americano's and the Breakfast Sandwich. Home made bread, fresh produce and delicious coffee. I also feel like I've been good when I get the tiny chocolate with my coffee. The cute baristas with the nice smiles don't hurt either."}
{"text":"Had been here twice at this Aroma Espresso Bar in Mississauga and midtown Toronto. We ordered their cappuccino, latte, espresso, mint tea and apple cider. They all came out so delicious with nice presentation.  Their prices are decent or even less expensive comparing to the same kind of quality cafe. Love to sit in this cafe with a relaxed, quiet and delightful ambiance.  It's so perfect that if you would like to enjoy a moment to chat with friends or even family and more importantly, you still would have a perfect cup of coffee or tea... Will definitely come back again and again...."}
{"text":"Saturday morning so quiet only 3 customers which is fantastic for me however. Service terribly slow. Asks me for my name but never informs me when food is ready so it sits getting cold.   Totally forgot one item that I ordered. For spending $30 on a breakfast it sure is aggravating. Also can they do something about the fan noise in the restaurant?  You can hardly hear the radio let alone yourself think."}
{"text":"Had a terrible breakfast. Ordered scrambled eggs and toast. I got cold, over cooked fried eggs, with regular bread. Coffee is fine but don't order the food. 
My daughters hot chocolate also terrible."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff. It is usually crowded around lunch time but one of the good place to have cold drinks especially in summer. It's a must to try their Ice Aroma Float that top with ice cream on the drink."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for lunch so it was not too busy. This Aroma opened in the newly constructed section in Vaughan Mills. There are plenty of seats and shop is kept pretty neat.

Service was great and order was made fairly quickly. I wasn't too hungry so I had the small coffee and croissant special for around $5. If you get the small latte/ cappuccino with croissant deal, that's around $7. As with all Aroma drinks, they come with a small piece of chocolate which is a nice touch. Would come back here as the food court in the mall is always very crowded."}
{"text":"Small but too nice for a coffee shop. Not enough seating for everyone who wants to go here. If you plan on impressing a chick with a pre-first date coffee shop then be ready for everyone to hear your conversation. Not advised for Jdate/Plenty of fish meeting points."}
{"text":"On a good day, it's a five star. Last visit got it two stars as two of three sandwiches were prepared wrong. They have to get their act together."}
{"text":"Visually appealing coffee shop, beautifully lit (except for the early evening sun - then it's blinding). 

Service at the register was friendly, barista was neutral. 

I ordered the Matcha Green Tea Latte, one of my favourite hot drinks. This was one of the worst ones I've tried before. The barista put way too much matcha in the drink; I watched him put two scoops of matcha in the cup and I was a little concerned. Sure enough, when I tried it the matcha was overpowering and caused the drink to be pretty unpleasant. As a side note, Starbucks has an awesome green tea latte."}
{"text":"Great coffee as always (Sm ~$2) and comes with a piece of chocolate which is always a bonus (who can say no to chocolate?). Had their quinoa salad for lunch as well, a good sized portion for around $8 which is a little bit pricey considering the number of options nearby. As with every Aroma, lemon water is available for you to fill yourself- great for those who just want some H2O, you aren't forced to pay $2 for bottled water. 

It does have a really nice outdoor patio at the front, so it's a great place to just grab a drink and enjoy the sunshine. Lots of seats available, the couple times I been there I didn't have a problem getting a seat."}
{"text":"Went here on a limb and this place was SO GOOD! Tried the Brazilian Hazelnut Latte (iced AND hot), Affogato, and the mini red velvet cupcake. Everything was delicious! The ambiance was great too. My friends and I didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, flavorful and fresh. The employees are super nice and helpful. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Relaxing ambience, decent sized patio with a nice view of East Liberty St opposite the Liberty Market; newspapers, free wi-fi and those fun little chocolates served with your coffee that remind you of a European cafe. 
Dropped in for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by the quick and friendly service. Ordered a warm chicken salad bowl that was big and full of veggies with a nice balsamic vinaigrette served on the side; freshly baked multi-grain bread slices and a nice strong coffee -- just 11 bucks and I'm a very happy camper."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place. Upon entry, was greeted with a smile and a clean environment. We Had a breakfast sandwich, a mocha, London fog, a chocolate cupcake, and some sugar free cookies. The sandwich was fantastic, the cupcake was super fresh, the cookies were amazing for sugar free. The London fog was top notch. The service was impeccable. Perfect cafe experience."}
{"text":"I found out about Aroma because it was around the corner from my work this summer and I need to tell you - it was a daily occurrence. Not only do you get a piece of chocolate with any drink but the service and food are awesome.

Try the sweet potato salad with goat cheese and argula! After you get that you won't feel bad about all the pastries and cookies. Go for the chocolate aroma cookies! They are only 50 cents and taste like mini brownies - divine! 

The space is good, lots of tables inside and outside. I also love the self-serve lemon water station for anyone who is waiting for their order. And the coffee fix-ins are great! I love how they have honey and sugar water! I never see these options at other cafés.

\"Aroma\" is not longer called that a work - everyone refers to it as \"aromz\" because of the nomz."}
{"text":"An absolute favourite. The Aroma salad is a go to. I can't wait for hot chocolate season to begin so that I can indulge in their version.
But the best is the service. The employees make you feel like you're going to a friend's for coffee. There is a blondish guy with black glasses who makes the best coffees."}
{"text":"This Aroma offers the standard fare, but it's the outstanding service and clean restaurant that garner it 5 stars. I work in the area and this Aroma is a welcome relief from the standard hamburgers and noodles that are offered for lunch. Every time I go in, the service is friendly, fast and helpful. From day one, I switched my morning coffee and lunchtime locale to this Aroma. Also, the patio is beautiful and comfortable."}
{"text":"Love the power breakfast. Sunny side up to did the wicked bread.  Simple breakfast but a nice mix of veggies, goat cheese and feta.  London for is a specialty tea.  Meal comes fast, but seating area is usually a bit dirty.  Overall big fan for a mall breakfast that's not greasy."}
{"text":"Located inside Fairview Mall, this Aroma location has a food court style layout. In the middle of the mall they have their espresso bar set up with a few tables and chairs spread out. One can sit there and have lunch or a beverage as shoppers walk around them. 

Aroma has a nice selection of Israeli sandwiches, salads and pastries. They have a nice variety of beverages too: espresso drinks, teas, smoothies, fresh juice etc. The espresso drinks here are great! They use Arabica beans that give a natural sweet riches to their coffee.

I tried their marshmallow hot chocolate (white available too) and it was the best! They use actual pieces of chocolate and steep that in frothy hot milk, add gigantic marshmallows and dust the drink off with chocolate. I expected this drink to be too sweet, but it was just perfection. Perfect drink for winter! Also, they give milk chocolate on the side with any espresso drink.

The staff here is fast and nice, the drinks are average price but the food here can be pricey for the amount they give you. Also, they could do a better job with cleaning the tables here.

Overall, Aroma Espresso Bar is a good place to grab some delish coffee or some pricey food items. I look forward to trying their orchid latte and Turkish coffee next time I come here."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey place to grab lunch but the quality and service remains the same.
I can never ever find a time during the day where this place isn't full. It's almost impossible to find a seat, and the place is generally loud yet still comfy.

I continue to come back here for their fabulous espresso drinks to go. Don't expect to find a seat here, if you do, you're lucky."}
{"text":"I love aroma... In principal. Today I was served a luke-warm cracked bowl of watery, tasteless coffee. Yes, all that in one order of coffee. 

Afterwards I went to the washroom. The floor was covered in water. Probably the same water I found in my cup. Maybe not, because at least then the \"coffee\" would have tasted like something. 

How boring and unsanitary. 

I would give this location a lower star rating but I'm satisfied with the chain overall... So bonus star."}
{"text":"Living and working in the area makes Aroma a frequent destination. I enjoy coming here almost every Saturday morning for breakfast. The food is top-notch and the staff are very friendly. They made a mistake once after a long wait, and they gave me free alfajores to make up for it. 

When they are busy, the wait time can be rather lengthy. I attribute this to the fact that they're basically a restaurant as much as they are a coffee shop. I've tried almost all of their menu items and they're all very good. The only downside is the price, especially compared to other breakfast places and cafes in the neighbourhood. They do have incredible pastries and snacks though. The alfajores, burekas and chocolate croissants are usually my afternoon snacks.

They are open late, but they do not serve food in the last hour or so. I learned this the hard way when I had a craving for a steak sandwich one evening. 

If you can't decide on a sandwich, get the steak! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. I can compare to Aroma downtown Toronto, North York on Yonge/Sheppard and Fairview mall. The coffee is pretty much like any other Aroma I've been to. I find that the brewed coffee is pretty bland, but not the worst. I've tried their food before. It's ok quality. Kinda pricy for a sandwich. The seating is comfortable and a reasonable environment to get work done or have a conversation.

Service:
The service has been iffy. Sometimes they're attentive and pleasant. Other times I have seen their employees on the job texting on their phones in plain sight and I'm not a big fan of that... Especially when I'm standing right in front of the cashier waiting to be served.

The cleanliness of the floors and tables has also been hit or miss depending on what time I have come. Considering I come to do work or have a meeting with someone, it's a bit distracting..

Lasting Impressions:
If you frequent the area, you know there's currently not much coffee selection in a walkable distance nearby (at the time of writing this post). Nowadays if I have lunch in the area, I look at the time and think to myself, do I have enough time to get my coffee elsewhere? If I'm not desperate for caffeine.. I usually just skip this place and drive to another coffee place."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened and unfortunately had a recent terrible experience. I ordered something very simple off the menu. It took a ridiculous amount of time to prepare. The staff that was making the drinks had to ask if the cook had even started preparing as he sees me standing their waiting for a lengthy period of time. At this point the grilled cheese was still not done. After several more minutes and no indication that the order was even started I said I couldn't wait. They let me walk out without offering a rebate. Customer service appears to have gone down hill. I won't be retuning."}
{"text":"Everything you hate about chains applies to aroma coffee. It's crowded. It's noisy. However, I will admit that the service was sufficient. The staff was helpful and welcoming, but it didn't make up for my coffee tasting terrible. I ordered a latte. As expected, it was plain, but even after adding my natural sugars it was still very bland. As I worked my way through the cup I realized that the blandness had little to do it being a latte, rather, it was the overall coffee. It was very watered down, and I just chucked it. I'd rather spare my palette. My husband ordered a mocha coffee (he's an even bigger snob than I am) and hated every second of it. He said that it was too sweet (which later he found it was because there were three chocolate masses stuck to the bottom of his cup). With so much independent coffee around the Toronto area, I won't make this mistake again. I'm a firm believer in making your own choices, but before you dive head first get the smallest size possible."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Aroma chain but his particular location just doesn't seem up to par with the others I've been to. I like their iced coffee and they offer almond milk which is a big plus for me, but the cafe itself always seems a little run down or dirty with empty plates laying around on the tables. Worse, the service is sloooow and somewhat standoffish. Last time I went they forgot my order, and when I interrupted the servers' conversation to ask about it the response was rude, like asking them for the drink I ordered 15 minutes ago was some huge annoyance. I wont return."}
{"text":"I laughed long and hard when I found out that the business that was going in the corner where Aroma now sits was going to be a coffee shop.  What I've termed the Annex \"coffee klatch corner\" includes a Starbucks (NE corner), a Second Cup (SE corner) and now, Aroma (NW corner).  The fourth corner is Paupers, where you can also in fact order coffee, though not their specialty (unless you want it Irish).  A stones throw away is a specialty coffee supply cafe, Green Beanery, and in the other direction, a fancy tea shop.  I guess Annex-ites just love their caffeine in any possible form.

Nonetheless, this Israeli coffee house seems to already have a steady group of loyal patrons, especially those of us who appreciate the little touches.  And Aroma has the finer details down to an art form.  Both the interior and patio seating areas have lovely design and furnishings, ample amounts of breathing room between tables, and inside there is also nice lighting schemes (including natural light from the huge windows).  Their cups, napkins, etc, feature their bold color scheme and design.  They take down your name so you can rest your bones while you wait for your coffee or food, and call you in a civilized, non-drive thru way over the PA system.  They give you a delcious wrapped chocolate with every purchase.  

While I mainly go for the coffee, I have occasionally eaten there as well.  Their sandwich and salad selections are top notch, and the salads are positively huge.  A big marketing push seems to be their \"power breakfast\" but a friend complained to me that there was too much salad and not enough substance.  The service is incredibly efficient but still human and friendly, and in the hot summer months when I cheekily asked for an extra side cup of ice for my iced coffee (so I could keep meltage to a minimum on the patio), they were more than happy to oblige.  

The free wifi is also a boon, with each receipt you get a temporary internet code which will work for the duration of your stay.  It's a pretty common sight these days to see a row of laptops lined up on the East-facing windows.

The main downer for me is that slick coffee joints are a dime a dozen in this caffeine fueled student neighborhood, and I can only hope that Aroma makes it in the long haul against the larger monolithic chains with a half dozen locations within blocks.  But much like falling in love too fast, getting too attached to Aroma could lead to eventual heartbreak.  Hang tough, Aroma!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in town. Good seating, good music, great location, free wifi, excellent food. Fantastic place to come after work for a coffee and a book."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Aroma. The staff is very helpful, the variety always keeps me busy, I love the chai tea latte (Iced or Hot).  The salads are yumlicious."}
{"text":"I love the aroma salad. its so good, service is good, lunch rush moves quick. As it is all prepared to order it does take a fair bit longer than some fast food joints, but hey its not fast food here!"}
{"text":"This is the second branch of Aroma Espresso in the Toronto area - the first is on Bloor St. Considering there aren't a lot of choices in Yonge & Eg, Aroma is like a breath of fresh air for me. They made artwork on top of my very delicious soy latte, which was cute. I also had a half greek sandwich that was ok, nothing special. The total for those two things was a little under $10.

The good thing is that there is wifi, the bad is that there's no power outlets. I was very disappointed about that. Will I go back? I'm not sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. In particular the location. This location is like a little getaway for me and my family to enjoy evening Tea time.

Love their Latte, Chai, and HOT CHOCOLATE, Biscotti, and Avocado Sandwich!! 

Customer service is friendly and nice!

I will keep coming to this place."}
{"text":"We went to Aroma on a Saturday morning. It wasn't our first choice, but nothing else was open at 8:30. 
The service was friendly and efficient enough, but the food was nothing to write home about. Two things that disappointed us were that there was nothing on the warm breakfast menu without eggs, and that the eggs \"done any way\" could not be poached.
Coffee, however was decent. The latte was much better than most others I've experienced in Toronto, but still not as good as back in Australia.
Overall, it does the job, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place best ice aromas! The food is always fresh and the staff is always friendly! I love coming here but to be honest it could be a bit cleaner!"}
{"text":"My go-to for chain coffee is Starbucks, but I've recently turned to Aroma. 

Americanos here (or at least, at this location?) are strong and flavourful, with slight acidity. Haven't had any other espresso based drinks, since I do not like my coffee mixed with any milk or syrup. 

For food, they have a lot of options, and lots of sweets. TRY THE BUREKA if you like savoury, buttery pastries. It's unarguably delicious. 

NOTE: if you want a place to sit with your laptop, note that this location only has elec outlets along the wall with the booths, and these booths are very in-demand seats, making access very difficult."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love their cappuccinos but their coffee isn't the only good items on the menu. I have ordered almost every item on the menu and i can say I enjoyed every single one of them immensely. I work in the building and I am constantly in and out of there. The staff is super friendly and helpful which makes the experience that much better."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, prompt service, and great coffee. A good place to spent the evening with friends or have a quick bite during the day. 

It is often busy, and it is usually hard to find a table. be prepared to wait on weekend evenings.  Would avoid if you have large group, 

Overall, a refreshing new option from the well established coffee franchises in the neighbourhood. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place stars cause their coffee is good. But it's the slowest service ever. Here on a Sunday afternoon and it's one barista who makes all the drinks. None of them seem to give a shit that their service is slow. They don't give free smiles here. And everyone's waiting for their drinks and frustrated."}
{"text":"The Best Place To Have A Nice Meal, And The Best Coffee In Toronto. Nice place, friendly stuff and the service is more than amazing. BIG LIKE!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, even it is crowded sometimes but I enjoy my weekend here. Food is great and delicious, stuff absolutely amazing and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place and even greater coffee. The price is comparable to Starbucks' but the display is a lot classier, and the chocolate though! The major downside here I feel is that there's a bit of racism, but I'm not going to go too much into that."}
{"text":"Plague of fruit flies everywhere was really off putting. It's January and they still have tonnes for fruit flies."}
{"text":"I tried the standard latte that came with a complimentary piece of chocolate. Tasted okay. Very nice place, however the seating arrangement leaves much to be desired. Very cramped in certain places and awkard to move around. The fare is standard for coffee and specialty drinks but is a little overpriced for food items. Overall okay experience."}
{"text":"Service is quite unfortunately the worst out of the many cafes I've been to as a student and for business meetings as I have lived in Liberty for 9 years. I prefer to go to Louie or Balzac's. Also way overpriced for the quality. The benefit is the patio if at least to get away from the unnecessary banging by the angry barista behind the counter."}
{"text":"I first learned about this place when I was in Isreal. And I instantly feel in love with it. I didn't know they had locations here in Toronto. The coffee is the best I've ever had. The food, which is made while you wait is suburb! It's just excellent! The salad portions are very generous, the fresh shakes are just to die for. And above all, it's not that expensive. 
I've never posted reviews for establishments, it shows how much I love this place!! And they're opening up a location at Yonge & Eglinton soon."}
{"text":"I love that Aroma has opened in Vaughan mills as it is a very nice alternative to the food court and starbucks for coffee choices.  They have some nice healthy options if you need to grab a bite and aren't interested in fast food.  My friend and I met here for a coffee and I grabbed some yogurt fruit and granola to snack on.  It was delicious and so was my Americano.  There is ample seating which is nice, and it didn't even feel like we were in the mall.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This location is new and is really nice and spacious inside.  I love Aroma coffee and it's a great addition to the York U neighbourhood.  It's located in the bottom of a student apartment building along with a number of other new food places.  I enjoy a few things about aroma which is their coffee, breakfast, and the water they always have available.  The chocolate that comes with your coffee always makes me smile because it reminds me of Europe.  I do think the sandwiches are highly overpriced but they do taste decent."}
{"text":"Probably the nicest coffee shop in Toronto. 
Comfy couches, great coffee and their Chocolate Croissants are the best EVER. With Nutella... sooo good!"}
{"text":"I really love the ambient and quiet atmosphere here! Also, the layout of the cafe is nice and chairs are comfy. Also, I enjoyed my hot chocolate in the thick glass cups they use."}
{"text":"This is an earned 4 star review.  I always enjoy Aroma because they still make actual espresso drinks.  I ordered a macchiato to go.  My friend received her drink and I waited.  The 3 people behind the counter were chatting and paying me no mind.  I thought they might have forgotten my drink as... It happens.  I inquired as to the missing drink... Turns out that the order receipt had been placed in the wrong area and the barista hadn't seen it.   So she made my coffee and apologized.  It wasn't that big of a deal but I appreciated the apology.  She then offered me a complimentary beverage for when I return.  I thought that was a nice way to handle customer service.  It's likely I will misplace that card for the complimentary beverage and might not even take them up on it, but it was a great way to handle the situation."}
{"text":"Good location, same menu that at other locations (ie. a bit overpriced). 

The music ruins everything: the staff in the kitchen put their own music on top of the one in the main room. I just can't stand 2 musics at the same time."}
{"text":"I had never been to any Aroma before, so was excited to try it out.

Unfortunately, this location disappointed me somewhat... My filter coffee was generic tasting; honestly, Starbucks' brewed coffee is ten times nicer. Maybe I should have followed the hints in the company's name and got an espresso-based drink?

The cafe was very messy and there were dirty plates everywhere. Servers weren't that friendly. 

I did like their wide range of drinks on offer, some of which sounded very unique. The self-service ice water with lemon was a nice touch.

I'll probably go to another Aroma Espresso location and try another drink and some food, but I don't think I'll return to this particular branch."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place and really enjoyed it. Food was really fresh and healthy. Smoothie was also great!"}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I ever had!!!! The worst scramble eggs plus untoasted bread...I would not recommend having breakfast here."}
{"text":"Sourly disappointing. 
Katelynn is PHENOMENAL. She is genuine, courteous, professional, happy, hardworking. 
The weekend kitchen staff is too slow.  
My sister and I have been LOVING Aroma for years. I don't think there's many places that beat those Alfajores, but the staff here can keep you waiting for up to 20min for a single drink and snack. 
The owner seems perpetually irritated, stressed and unhappy; which is the last thing you want to receive with your morning coffee :(
I think overall we get the impression that Katelynn runs the show and carries the weight of the rest.
Also $10 for a basic breakfast sandwich on toast is pretty steep.

Update: Today I waited 15min for a burnt bureka :(
I wish there was decent coffee in this neighbourhood from a small locally owned shop to support? Any suggestions?

Tried them again August 14th: another burnt bureka; and the chef got our order wrong 3 times. Think I give up.

My sister loves Aroma too much, so we went once more: Elena is REALLY efficient, professional, polite, mature. Nicolette interrupted me several times when taking my order. She simply could not withdraw from her script. The bread they make sits out in the open near the ceiling uncovered. My toast was not toasted, but the crust was hard enough to break a tooth on."}
{"text":"Even one star is too high of a review.My experience at this place was shameful...for starters, the layout is not ideal, it wasn't apparent where to line up to order; it was a clusterfuck around the bar and it was wasn't even busy. That's not a big deal though, the problem was how the staff handled it-the woman taking orders practically scolded us for not lining up correctly. When I finally got my drink it was scolding hot; any one who's been a barista would know how to  properly steam their milk.  It was so hot that after a  20 minute walk the drink was still too hot to drink,  I ended up with a burnt tongue.
The coffee itself tasted bland, burnt and acidic.I threw the drink out. There goes $4 ( that's right $4 for a latte) that I'll never see again. My partner got an americano that tasted like watered down black coffee from coffee time. In short, walk a block east to Starbucks or west quantum coffee . Don't waste your money on this place, they are clearly running on the fumes if half decent branding and a good location."}
{"text":"this is the bad coffee shop I visited. service are very bad, staff are very slow motion. they didn't concern how many people are lining up. they only talk talk talk to the customer. every time just want to a coffee need to wait 20 mins. I work there, now I give up. I change to second cup."}
{"text":"Super friendly server, great drinks and snacks.  A perfect place to warm up on a chilly day.  Best hot chocolate!! Also they offer a 15% discount to students between 3-5."}
{"text":"Delicious salads. Wifi. Outdoor and indoor seating. Very busy at lunch time on weekends. Butter croissants are called \"butter\" for a good reason:):) cupcakes melt in your mouth, Aroma Cookies very addictive, and chocolate croissants an excellent take-home breakfast. However, slightly pricey if you're looking for a cheap filling meal, BUT amazing quality. Staff very personable and friendly, and will strike up a conversation with you if you sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Great place to grab a healthy salad for lunch.Their bread is delicious as well and the iced aroma is a nice cool drink to get in the summer."}
{"text":"Awesome location, beautiful design and very comfortable seating area! I love the statue of the children.
Incredibly poor and boarder line rude service, I went there yesterday and the was two staff members (Joey and a female with short hair), I was standing in front of the cash, she was organizing the cash drawer and he was singing , a minute goes by and she is commenting on how she like the song he is singing and he is getting louder, she looks me in the eye and continues to count the cash, it's three minutes now, I decided to ask for help, she responded \"are you ready now?\", I made the order with specific requests, I went to pick up my order and she is trying to explain that what I ordered is different from what I want, I'm confused! Can I have what I ordered? She is annoyed now and she dose what I asked. The table was dirty, I asked Joey for help and he gave me a wet napkin."}
{"text":"Megan the barista was awful !! I came to the counter to make an order and she was texting on her phone and didn't even bother to acknowledge me! The trainee (Mike, I think) was kind enough to direct me to the next cash and take my order. Immediate coaching needed!!"}
{"text":"Quick in and out coffee joint not much different than any other chains. I had ice coffee with easy ice and it was more soury bitter than toasty. Nothing really memorable to report here, I haven't tried their hot drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered a Matcha latte for here but I was given the latte in a paper cup.

The steamed milk wasn't done properly. When you see large bubbles, the foam milk is overheated. It ruins the supposedly creamy texture of latte. This is a basic skill of a barista.

Wifi connection sucks. I never had any good connection in any Aroma stores. However I can't claim that all the aroma stores have bad wifi, but two bad ones out of two is pretty bad, considered both are new stores in new commercial plaza which should have good internet speed to begin with. There are less than 5 people with computer in the store and the wifi connection is already falling apart like I'm in a third world country."}
{"text":"Wifi doesn't work here... Also I find the service quality here isn't very good. I ordered the aroma white hot chocolate but got a regular hot chocolate mixed with a bit of white chocolate. On top of that the price is quite expensive for what you get. I used to love Aroma, but I'm just not impressed with my experience here."}
{"text":"First visit to aroma was today, definitely won't be my last. Cashier and barista were very friendly. Had the aroma coffee which was amazing, not too sweet. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously, Aroma?! Place is EMPTY and I'm asked to leave my table since they're reserved for groups. This is after I order coffee and a meal. You just lost a customer. #badbusiness"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan but wish they had iced green tea lattes!"}
{"text":"Great location bright and cheery. Friendly staff make you feel at home and of course great selection of healthy food options. Their bread is sooo delish!! If you're looking for a good place to meet friends for a quick meal or coffee, this location is awesome."}
{"text":"The guy who works the cashier at the Queens Quay location is awful.  He doesn't greet you in any way, barely smiles, takes your order without even looking at you, mumbles \"thank you\" under his breath, and barely acknowledges that you even exist.  Thankfully the barista knows how to make a killer latte."}
{"text":"Like to go for their yummy frozen yogurt!!! Wish they had a better variety of soups tho"}
{"text":"I used to love going here for my breakfast in the morning but after 4 times in a row that they screwed my order up I gave up.

After the first 2 times I went and talked to the manager who was nice enough to refund me and give me free drink cards. Just sucks that it can't be used for cold drinks as well but hey.. a freebie is a freebie so I can't complain.

They're nice there and all but c'mon.. if it's a slow period and I'm waiting for 10 mins for the wrong thing then that's not cool."}
{"text":"Great food, great and fast service, I really enjoyed how they accommodate you with your order preferences. I would definitely go back, I found the washroom a little dark and scary but still---I also like the patio idea and be able to smoke out there."}
{"text":"The food is good, the people are nice and attentive, the place is clean and bright, and the seats are comfy. I love the lentil soup."}
{"text":"Worked For This Location. Kitchen Is Dirty And Not Kept Up To Standard Health Policy. Manager Doesn't Care About Quality Of Food. He Will Sell Expired Food To Customers. As Long As You Follow Aroma List Than Basic Logic To Keep Food Preserved Doesn't Matter."}
{"text":"I love Aroma. The drinks are made extremely consistently. My favorites are the cappuccino, latte, and ice aroma. As for food, I usually order the warm chickpea salad, portobello sandwich, lentil soup or the aroma salad. There are tons of healthy options. The staff at this location are super nice....  since I am a regular, they always greet me with a huge smile."}
{"text":"Hate to do this - I usually love Aroma, every other location that I've been to in the City has their act together. This place, not so much. It is usually dirty, garbage on the tables, and staff can't be bothered to clean up. The worst though are the bathrooms. They are sickening, I am not sure how often they are cleaned. Without going into too many details, after going in there in the summer I lost my appetite. On top of that, there was no soap in the bathrooms so I am really hoping staff have other places in the restaurant to wash their hands. Staff gave me attitude when I tried to bring the state of the bathrooms to their attention, and then thinking I left talked loudly about how the bathrooms were fine and they did not know what I was talking about. I guess the chances of hygiene improving there are quite low, so I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I loved this store cuz its perfect location and quiet  environment for hmw. But i accidentally checked in on yelp today and found a coupon and they said its something on yelp and they cannot do anything about it because its not something physical. Im not craving for muffins, im just quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Inexperienced workers. Every time I order something, it never comes to me. They lie all the time. I ordered a latte and it didn't come to me. I ordered a portobello sandwich, and they were also treating me like dirt. I wish they had more experience. This is why I don't like to come here."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. You pay a bunch of money for crap. I ordered French toast, chicken hash, beef sandwich, and a kale mango smoothie. 

The beef sandwich was decent but everything else was a complete ripoff. The French toast barely had any egg, the chicken hash contained 1 single tiny piece of chicken. 

I was really looking forward to the kale mango smoothie but it tasted like it was made with mango flavoured powder with a tiny bit of kale thrown in. I drink a lot of real fruit juice (mango is my favourite) so I can definitely tell the difference."}
{"text":"Why is everyone who works at this location literally miserable. I like this coffee shop as it offers great salads on the go, and yummy
Quick bite breakfast. However, there is no excuse for the terrible attitudes of the staff. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"I enjoy the fact that Aroma is something different from the typical coffee chains such as Starbucks and what not. They have a nice selection of beverages with or without caffeine and a healthy selection of salads and sandwiches on their menu. Everything is very fresh. I recently had a salad at Aroma and the portion size was fairly big. I am also crazy about their Ice Aroma Float, that's probably my favourite drink on their entire beverage menu. The down side about Aroma is that they are quite overpriced. For food that you can simply make at home and what not you are looking at over $10 for a meal. Beverages are over $6. Definitely not an everyday eatery I would say."}
{"text":"Aroma has many locations but not every one opens late. This one opens t'il 11pm. They have good espressos and I like their salads."}
{"text":"SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!

Starbucks watch out! 

Aroma Espresso Bar is now officially my favourite coffee shop. This place is huge! (Considering it was in middle of downtown) 

LOVED the atmosphere, very clean. 

FREE WIRELESS ACCESS! WOO HOO! 

Perfect place to get together with friends to do some work. Lots of seating.

Can't go to this place too often though. I'll drain my bank account. Coffee costs $3.50 Yikes! (But then so does Starbucks)"}
{"text":"I understand for some people this is not their career and will eventually move on to something else.  However you are currently representing a corporation who is paying you for your time so have a little pride in your work and don't be a dumb ass.
I have been to this location 3 times.  Review based solely on service

The positives:
decent sized café and generally good environment for catching up on a book or studying.  Drinks are pretty good.

Negatives:
of the 3 times I visited they forgot to make my order 3 times.... (was not busy max 6-7 people in line).  Having worked in the service industry for 15 years I get it things happen orders get misplaced.  First time is forgivable, second time you give them benefit of the doubt. THIRD TIME it's a fucking insult.  After  20 minutes of waiting and all the patrons behind me got their orders already I came to the conclusion they forgot my order again.  Lately I've been trying to be a calm and cool person and not let things get me riled up.  I approached the counter with a smile and using my indoor voice I asked the young girl behind the counter 'is my order ready? Everyone else behind me got theirs already'.  

Now keep in mind she asked me the same question the previous 2 times.  'um sir did you pay for your order?'  I so wanted to use my outdoor voice and blast her but I remained calm and said yes I did. Now either she thinks I'm stupid and don't know how paying for goods before receiving them works, or she thinks I'm trying to scam her.

Life tip:  instead of accusing your client of malicious intent to defraud a latte and a pastry.  I would suggest the following actions FIRST.

1)  Go up to computer and look for a receipt, if there is one, there is a 99% chance I paid for       the goods.

2)  Think back 10 minutes do you remember making a specific latte and warm up a pastry in the nuke box?  If not you probably did not make my order.

3)  If you weren't the one who took my cash ask your co worker standing RIGHT NEXT TO YOU!

Now if the answer is No to the above scenarios then ask me if I paid for the order.

To top it off after she realised her dumb ass forgot to make my order she tells me the pastry I ordered is all gone.  Of course its all gone I ordered the last one in the display case.  Where the hell did it go from the time I pointed to the pastry to me paying for it.  I ended up paying extra for another pastry because the one I ordered disappeared.

p.s. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich on two separate occasions and each time I got a different size while paying the same price.  If anything you guys are defrauding me.
In conclusion I love going to the aroma chains and am willing to pay their ridiculous prices because I can always find a seat and is generally good environment for studying.  HOWEVER will not be going back to this location for fear that if they forget my order a 4th time I may not be so civil.  HIRE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A CLUE."}
{"text":"Always great service and consistently excellent food! Love the bourekas and salads and lattes. Certainly one of my favourite go-tos in the area. 

In the summer the lemonana is amazing as well!

I hope this location begins to serve beer like the others. Would make it that much more appealing for a light evening meal/dinner."}
{"text":"It's nice, but at the time, some of the the tables were not cleared or wiped down. Found a spot, not the most ideal but it was the cleanest at the time. This was the only let down. 

I've been meaning to visit the place for awhile but every time I go I can never find a table. In the summer it's jumping and you can't get a seat inside or out on the patio.

It's a cafe, and not just for drinks. You can order sandwiches and salads too. There's a person working in the kitchen preparing.

The teas and coffees differ from the norm, offering things like a Pina Colada tea and a Canadiana a twist on the Americano,  expresso with the addition of steamed milk. Nice touch inc. a small chocolate with each drink order.

Oh I couldn't resist the cookies when I was there (going through a cookie monster phase right now). They were .50 cents each bites sized. What's the harm right?! :p . I had tried a few varieties. Notable was the Aroma chocolate cookie ( tasted like a brownie) and a sugar free cookie, a thin  butter cookie with chopped almonds. Apparently all cookies and pastries are baked in house, I could see there's an oven behind the cash. 

Overall I liked Aroma, a change from the typical Starbucks, Second Cup offerings and the taste was gourmet excellent."}
{"text":"I've visited this Aroma location multiple times now and all my experiences have been positive. The drinks menu is extensive and really does give off the essence of an authentic cafe restaurant. However, their sandwiches, soups, salads, and pastries aren't to be overlooked. I've had the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich quite a few times and I can't begin to say how delicious it is. I would recommend it to anyone, especially as a vegetarian option. Tried the steak sandwich once and it was just okay, wouldn't have it again. The salads are generous portions and you'd hope so because of what you're paying, I LOVE the Mediterranean Pasta Salad, it's my go-to salad whenever I'm there. I like it so much I've gone to the lengths of recreating it at home (super easy to do!). I'd recommend the Ice Aroma to anyone craving a sweet treat, it's comparable to an ice cream milkshake with a great coffee flavour. The Ice Lemon Mint is a staple to their menu and is super refreshing. 

Ambiance is perfect in my opinion. The decor is modern, and the seating arrangement suits many types of diners (single, double, groups). It's not the most quietest place, and serves as a social hub for many families and friends often.  

Service is okay. I've never had a problem with it, but it is what it is. You order and give your name, they input it, they call you when your order is ready, you pick it up. Never had anything misplaced or forgotten with the order. Also, once my friends and I stayed until closing and they didn't kick anybody out even though it was 17 minutes past- kind of a nice thing to remember. 

Overall, definitely one of my favourite chains of authentic coffee and sandwiches, would recommend to all. Bring about $15 and you're set for a good meal."}
{"text":"I bought a Coffee and chocolate croissant .   I'm really hungry but this is Very poor quality ."}
{"text":"Best coffee place. I had a cappuccino and apple danish yum yum. If you are looking for a cool n relaxed environment you should pay a visit :)"}
{"text":"Waiting 20 minutes for four coffees and a bakery item that only needs to be heated up. What's the hold up?

But coffee/ food is great."}
{"text":"Great service ! The guys tag said in training but if it didn't say that I wouldn't have known   he asked my name for the order then said \" thanks ashley\" . So friendly  drinks taste great and it was inexpensive  10 out of 10 ."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 2.5 because the bathrooms are almost never clean and the service can be excruciatingly slow, but I really like the alfajores and the 2nd floor seating. If I was a rich twenty something I would be here all the time. Having said that, the place was full of seniors having brunch today. Their hot drinks are served with a complimentary chocolate. The white hot chocolate is pretty good. This location is poorly managed but other locations are pretty good."}
{"text":"i paid 14 dollars for a breakfast sandwich, oj,  and coffee. tbe breakfast sandwhich made me lethargic and sedated. I wouldnt recommend this place for the price point. I also wiped out at the corner of the walkway, since the business did not clear a safe path for pedestrians in contravention of the cities bylaw TMC 629"}
{"text":"Decent espresso, small patio to enjoy it on. Great pitstop on a Sat morning bike ride."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Friendly staff, over priced hot chocolate, but well worth the experience. Lovely. I'll come back."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and one of the things that excites me about a new city is checking out the local Aroma Espresso Bar! I've been NYC, Tel Aviv, and Toronto locations. I love Aroma!

The coffee is delicious. Breakfast is awesome. Get the breakfast sandwich or plate with whole wheat bread. If all whole wheat bread tasted like Aroma whole wheat, nobody would want to eat white bread ever again.

I'm definitely going back on my next trip to Toronto"}
{"text":"I love the menus at Aroma, no matter what the location; but, it's the people at Yonge & Pleasant that make the big difference.  Arta, Katelynn & the team are super efficient and are a pleasure to see every morning!  Today was the one-year anniversary and what a treat to receive a free coffee to celebrate.  Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"Un petit déjeuner pour 9 $ ? L'offre semblait trop bonne. Résultat : un petit bout de guacamole, une salade concombre, carottes et tomates, et deux ufs à peine cuits sur lequel flottait encore une mare d'ovalbumine à peine en voie de coagulation. Je passe sur l'assiette sale ..."}
{"text":"It's a typical Aroma Espresso bar, I've been here 3 times. But, it is horribly noisy. Hard to hold a conversation or even have a bite in peace. Don't even bother trying to get work done."}
{"text":"We come to this coffee shop from time to time, and we love it. Coffee is very well prepared, big variety of teas, and the food is delicious. My favourite is an avocado sandwich.
It's a good place to meet a friend for a cup of coffee or to have a business meeting. They have wireless, which is actually working.
It gets very crowded in the evening, so sometimes it's impossible to find a table right  away and you need to wait for someone to leave. Not a problem in the morning or during the day.
The only minus are the patched benches with the black tape over the sits.The coffee shop closes at 10 pm at night. The plaza has a lot of parking space."}
{"text":"A good alternative to Starbucks or Second Cup if you're in the Annex area.  Sometimes it is difficult to find a seat.  Bonus free wi fi.  I had green tea here."}
{"text":"I always thought this was another overpriced coffee shop but boy was I wrong.
They actually serve pretty decent breakfast and lunch options.
While it is not the cheapest in town I think you get a lot for you buck.
I recently got hooked on their Ace sandwich which consists of grilled juicy chicken breast,guacamole and a fried egg. This sandwich is ginormous! so get the half size if yoyt not starving.
If you have a sweet tooth try their alfajores they taste just like they did back home.

I also really love the fact that they give you a comp. mini chocolate with your coffee.
I mean who doesn't love chocolate?"}
{"text":"The hot chocolate is amazing!!  It's practically a drinkable dessert!  

However, I give three stars because the people behind the counter are not the friendliest.  No smiles when serving me whatsoever.  I'm big on customer service, and employees making me feel like my business is welcomed.  

I might try this location again, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but lately find it disappointing to get my regular coffee in a tepid temperature. 

I tried to come at different times in the morning or afternoon and even explicitly asked for my coffee to be hot but keep on getting the same tepid coffee which after adding milk gets almost cold. 

Will have to find another place to get my coffee."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their mocha, salads and sandwiches.

In the morning on the way to work i tend to pick up the croissant & coffee deal $3.40 I think.  Their croissants are the best yet as they're so buttery and pretty much melts in your mouth!  You can get the butter or chocolate croissant.

If I don't get that, I opt for the turkey BLT on croissant.  It's around $6 - which is pretty pricey, but it has turkey bacon, lettuce, tomato and turkey breast - lots of toppings! Definitely worth it!

I also love their caesar salad with chicken or the kale & portobello mushroom salads - my go to at lunch time."}
{"text":"I like this place they have a nice patio where you can sit in summer time and enjoy a hot cappuccino."}
{"text":"I've been working in Liberty Village almost a month now, write across the street from Aroma. Even if it weren't such an obvious choice based on proximity I'm sure I'd still be there at least once a day almost every day. 

For breakfast or a really light lunch I'm obsessed w the bureka. Super rich flaky pastry folded over yummy perfectly tangy feta cheese. It's like a croissant and spanikopita had a sweet sweet baby. I love it. 

I like their lattes, but they're expensive. The hot chocolate never seems to mix up enough for me, unless I stay in and have a real spoon to use. However I LOVE their iced lattes, and appreciate the sugar syrup to sweeten with. 

I'm totally a fan. I'm often there more than once a day, I haven't tired of burekas yet... But I'm keeping it to 2-3 a week to keep myself somewhat in check!"}
{"text":"Horribly expensive for what you get. Paid over $13 got two cold eggs one slice of undercooked turkey bacon. Coffee and some bread. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Yuck. 

My $13 salad was gross. With fake chicken.  The ice cold bread served with ice cold butter went straight into the garbage without tasting so maybe that was what I should have ate...

Not shocked there aren't more locations..."}
{"text":"--Update----

After I talked  to the head office, the same manager called me and said she's gonna check the security camera ( this is just because she was told to do that by head office . When I went to the store I was told that they didn't see my transaction history and so I just have to leave the store not to bother them) 

Then 10 mins ago I just received the call saying that I was right I did not receive the change.

Again, I'm upset not because I didn't get a change, but because manager didn't listen to me and she told me to leave the store.

Also my money is still missing in the store.
How can I trust what they are making, providing, or saying any more.

TOTALLY 0 STAR !!!

The only good thing is Aroma head office lady is very polite and professional. 

However no more aroma ever again. 


0 star for this location.
They technically called me \"\" lier  \"\"


I went to this store and did purchase a couple items yesterday.

However I realize later on that I didn't receive the change back.( about 15 CAD)

So I went back to the store( 1mins after I left the store)  and asked them if they see my money in the till. 
They had my receipt ( not a receipt but a paper for them to make drink), which means that there was a transaction between them and me.

Anyways I was told to contact later on because right now there's no proof that I didn't receive the change . 

So I went back to the store next day and explained again.
However believe or not  the store manager told me that \"\" THERES NO TRANSACTION HISTORY OF MINE\" 

So there no point us talking here and I was told to leave the store.
Also other worker told me that I might drop the change.

Who can drop the 13 dollars and some coins?!?!

What a horrible customer service !!! 
They told me that I didn't purchase yesterday. 

She just walked me away and helped other customer telling me leave the store without even looking at me.

I never ever go back to this location even now feels like never ever Aroma again because of this store.

I do suggest you guys make sure that you get a right change and be careful!!! if you leave anything in this store it might not come back to you."}
{"text":"Aroma is a really great alternative to something like Starbucks- you're feeling some failsafe coffee without any 'tude. Trust me, no 'tude here whatsoever. I'd been to the Bloor location before but this time I got a different drink and a sandwich so I figure that merits a fresh review. 

Drink: Iced coffee! If it was warmer outside, I would have enjoyed this even more. It's exactly what it sounds like, coffee on ice. But the coffee was good and came in a cup that was basically spill-proof. Every drink gets a little chocolate! I'm still not over this. 

Sandwich: Woah. That was delicious and healthy too! They MUST bake their own bread in house because it was so fresh-tasting and fluffy. When I first picked it up I thought all the fillings would fall through! But it held up nicely. I got the half-portion and it filled me up just the right amount. For just 4.35 plus tax, it was a portabello mushroom sandwich with feta, sun-dried tomato paste, bean sprouts and basil. Ah, so good! The middle, the crust, every part. 

Service: Such nice people, they come around and pick up your used dishes when you're done like at a restaurant. The only weird part is when it comes to picking up the food and drink they call you're name and you come up. Well, that would work perfectly if the guy did not mumble too close to the microphone and made names audible. Also, how hard is the name \"Danielle\"? It's clearly not, \"Daniel\". He corrected himself once he saw me.

Great times, good atmosphere. You could definitely stay a while. Personally, I'd be alright eating breakfast, lunch and dinner there."}
{"text":"Had a chai latte here while catching up with high school bestie. The space is nice and big. Seriously, it goes way further back than one would think, but that's not where the bathrooms are. They lie somewhere is the middle are quite nice. 

Ordering in fairly easy and straightforward. I like how they have the descriptions of drinks too so you don't feel like an idiot for asking or simply go with what you know. Since it wasn't very busy when we came in, the whole delivery process wasn't really necessary though I understand how it would be useful on a busy day. You order and then either take your seat or wait by the bar until someone says your name on a headset and speaker system. Then ya pick it up! After a little smell test we were able to figure out whose drink was whose and grab a seat towards the back. 

The table had a dirty cup on in but we chose it for it's location by the window and amount of chairs. Heavy into our gossip session a man came around to tidy up and he took it away. He also asked  if we still wanted our almost empty cups but I held on, not wanting to miss a drop! 

The chai latte had a nice and foamy top with a heart on it! It didn't feel so \"large\" but it definitely stayed warm and lasted long enough so no complaints! The whole thing was nice, flavourful and milky. I felt truly in for the treat. 

And the bonus chocolate! How nice of you, Aroma!"}
{"text":"Watery, watery, watery coffee lattes and iced teas. Big spacious location and comfortable but their coffee products are subpar. I guess you get what you pay for since the prices are above Tim Hortons and below Starbucks."}
{"text":"On a Sunday morning, they only had one barista taking and making the order. I think I waited around 20 mins for my latte even though there was no line. The barista didn't really understand English. She didn't quite seem to get my order. I wanted a hazelnut latte with an extra shot of espresso. The end product was a hazelnut latte and a separate shot of espresso on the side. The latte was also very sweet even though I told her I wanted it half sweet."}
{"text":"Second time Ive come to Aroma Espresso Bar in my short stay here in Toronto. It is a very comfortable cafe with both delicious food and coffee.

I was looking fir a quick easy place with healthy food option without going completely meatless. This is defintely the spot. They have options for everyone and some delicious treats as well. I would absolutely come back.

I order the Aroma Hash with a bowl of chicken bone broth. Both items were perfect and extremely satisfying."}
{"text":"When it first opened the customer service seemed to be on point but as the weeks went on it got worse. My main complaint is the amount of loitering they allow from people that don't even buy anything. This really pissed me off one day because I had to struggle to find a seat after spending $12 on lunch as all the seats were occupied by inconsiderate people setting up shop at the tables with their books and computers stretching it out as it was their home. At one point I literally watched 2 people walk in and sat down in a booth without buying anything as I watched other frustrated paying customers try to find a seat. When seats did become available they remained dirty with trays and cups. Does anyone work here? Helloooooo! Clean the tables! The management here really needs to look at this, maybe even read this review and tighten up on customer service because it truly is terrible."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK only because I work in the building and it's so convenient to grab my breakfast/coffee on the way upstairs. 

That said, this place is pricey. This morning I paid almost $9.00 for a medium coffee and Egg & Cheese Croissant. The coffee was mediocre, there was coffee grinds at the bottom. The croissant was super oily, the grease stained the paper bag and eating it was a mess.

For those who are not ordering to-go, there is a nice patio outside and they offer free WiFi. It can get really busy during lunch time, so it might be hard to even get a seat. 

I heard they have amazing salads, but never tried it myself. Overall, the variety in their menu is pretty broad. Service is only good when they aren't busy. There's free lemon water for those waiting for their order. Their condiments table is usually stocked up with honey, sugar water, brown sugar, splenda, whole/skim milk or cream, cinnamon powder...etc. 
 
If you're lazy like me (at times) to walk across the street to Tim Hortons or Starbucks, this pricey alternative is A-OK."}
{"text":"This may be one of the slowest Aromas I've ventured into. 

Upon entering, customers easily confuse people waiting for the order with the people lining up to order/pay. When I visit Aroma during lunch, there's usually just a clutter of people standing randomly by the entrance. 

The staff at this location are also not the friendliest. They take your order stone-faced and simply put, don't smile much. The tip jars have tacky signs that reference Justin Bieber, which I really don't find funny. They definitely need to improve on their customer service skills..

The forest mushroom soup that I usually order is a bit watery at this location and takes forever to make (?). They give you a paper bag for the bread, but not for the soup. It's just slightly annoying that I have to request a bag every time so my fingers don't freeze by the time I walk back to my office. 

The carrot cake and coconut orange cake are both delicious! The size is small for the price charged ($3) - I allow myself to indulge once in a while :) 

Seats are almost impossible to find during the lunch rush, so I usually order take-out. Albeit a tad pricey, items on their menu are still delicious - they just need improvement on customer service."}
{"text":"Well priced and delicious espresso drinks made very quickly. Reminds me of a classier Tim Hortons, with some alcoholic beverages on the menu. 

I got the affogato with baileys and it just kind of hit the spot."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Aroma Espresso Bar chain.  The recent opening of Aroma in Liberty Village is a breathe of fresh air in the air.  They have a big patio which I can't wait to use when the weather is warmer.  Free WiFi is great!  I love the fact that their menu is extensive and not overtly priced.  All day breakfast - you can not go wrong!

Aroma is my new hang out in Liberty Village to get work done or catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"Very good quality food, communication can use a bit of improvement, and prices decent.

M'lady and I went to this venue for a brunch.M'lady pointed out a Bulgarian dish on the menu, so I decided to try it, since that's where I'm originally from. I really liked the cooked doughy dish, with the exception that I found the pickles to be a tad too \"edgy\" in taste (a bit bitter, perhaps).

Also, I first placed a food order, and then decided to also get a drink. They called me over when my drink was ready, but then I asked if the two bags of food on the counter were for me, and the girl behind the counter got all confused. Eventually with the help of someone else behind the counter, they did end up determining that the food in the two bags on the counter was indeed for me.

Aside from that little bit of confusion, I really enjoyed my visit to this venue. It was clean, and mostly bright, with free wifi available for customers.

I'd definitely return to this place again based on my over-all experience there."}
{"text":"Bright, shiny and new is the new Aroma location on King/Spadina!  I love the Aroma chain and it is great to see this addition to the area.  The space is open and inviting.  The menu is standard menu like other Aroma locations.  The only downside is to make sure you power up your laptops before you decide to work at this location; there is only one accessible outlet in the cafe.

I will definitely be back to hang out in the future."}
{"text":"OK so keep in mind that I'm in one of those moods today. There was an opportunity for excellent customer service that would've cost Aroma $0.60 -  Unfortunately they took the experience from a possible five star rating to a two star rating for a $.60 cent transaction. Here is what happened.

I walked in and asked for a hazelnut latte. The guy gave me the total and I put my card in the machine and was entering my pin when I asked if I could have it with Almond milk. The manager (Lisa) ran over and said \"hang on..... pull the card out. I need to charge the extra\" . I get that Almond milk may come at an extra cost but figured this was an opportunity for them to shine. I asked her how much the difference was. She told me the difference in cost is $.60. So for a $.60 decision, I am now writing this review. It tells me what I need to know about this place.  This was a perfect opportunity for her to say, \"just so you know there is typically an extra charge. We will let it go. Just be aware for future.\"  They would've had a five star rating for stellar service but...... No

This is a great location with lots of seating and very clean. However, this is a customer service fail in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I used to look forward to my Sunday morning visit which would include breakfast and coffee in a pleasant decor. Unfortunately, after multiple episodes of horrible service from one particular staff member, I will make this my last visit to this location. On this occasion I walked up to the cashier and very clearly asked for an extra-small cappuccino. When I received the order, it was a larger size, for which I was charged accordingly. When I told the cashier that I had ordered an extra-small beverage, she rudely blurted out \"Well I heard medium!\", handed me the wrong size, and walked away. Judging from the other Yelp reviews this standard of service seems to be a common problem at this location, and is in marked contrast to other Aroma locations. I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I love the decorationof this cafe. Convenience location, nice street view, open patio which are totally match what the downtown people wanted. price reasonable. But the one thing I am not really happy with is they call customer names by microphone for pick up the order. Loud and a little bit embarrassing~"}
{"text":"Very overpriced. Crowded with students who take seats for hours at a time and work on their laptops with their books and bags all over the place. Servers are not particularly friendly. Convenient location, but that's about its only positive attribute."}
{"text":"Nastiest toilets EVER!!!

My boyfriend ordered a coffee in the meantime and I went to the bathroom. It was GROSS. No toilet paper in any stall, all the feminine hygiene trashes were on the ground and/or spilt on the floor. Piss on the seat. Water all over the sink counter. If I need to go to the bathroom really bad and that's the only place available for the next 2 miles, I'LL WAIT.  Can't imagine if their kitchen is the same......"}
{"text":"I came to aroma at Yonge and Eglinton tonight. I always order the quinoa salad. The price has gone up substantially from $5.95 to $7.65 and to make matters worse the portion of quinoa that was in the salad was very very minimal and they charged me an additional 0.75 for the extra salad dressing - apparently a new policy this week.  A classless act for an over priced salad. In the past I've simply asked the additional salad dressing and they provided it with no problems. I would advise against going to this Aroma location."}
{"text":"Worst location! Very very slow service, waited 15 minutes for my Ice Aroma+extra expresso shot(an usual for me)... when I got it, it was just Ice blended with some cream(probably too busy, forgot half the ingredients)! Definitely not the creamy ice aroma I've had at other locations. Oh, and I even saw that the bartender didn't add the extra expresso shot I paid for, so I purposely asked her  when she was handing the drink over to me... \"Did you add the expresso shot?\" She paused and replied \"Yes.\" I thought okay, maybe they did it in the kitchen this time. My ass! It's Ice and cream, there is no damn trace of coffee. I went back to find her and told her it's not Ice Aroma, telling her politely that it literally taste like blended ice, and she replied me \"Are you sure you didn't order the Aroma Lite?\"  !!!!!! Wow girl! I had the Lite version before too, trying to trick me eh. Anyways after a firm voice of \"This is not Ice Aroma with extra expresso shot, can you remake it?\" I got eyeballed, and waited another 10 minutes for it and no apologizes.... But this time when it's done right, it taste sooo creamy and nutty like the usuals from the other locations. BTW, this was from 2 weeks ago."}
{"text":"My SO and I dropped in at Aroma to get some work done.  Our default coffee shop is usually Starbucks but the one on Bloor was packed.  We decided to check out Aroma since it was next door.

The atmosphere is an upscale coffee shop with mood lighting.  They have an extensive menu where you order various caffeinated beverages as well as something to nosh on.  We opted for an americano and brewed coffee for our working session.  The coffee was wonderful!  I like the fact that they use glass mugs if you are staying in.

The free Wifi was slow but it did was efficient for checking emails.

My recommendation would be to find a seat before you order.  The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon with lots of students working away."}
{"text":"I really love the food at Aroma.  The menu is full of nutritious lunch choices like organic kale and portobello salad and quinoa salad.  the tuna sandwich is great too.  What ruins this location, in particular, is the front-line staff.  Smiles are rare to be seen.  The food is still delicious - when they get your order right.  I typically get food for take-out - twice in the past few weeks they have forgotten to put in salad dressing in the bag with the salad.  The first time I came back from work to get it and with timed lunch breaks that can be a problem.  the second time I caught it before returning to work.  More recently, they forgot to include cutlery and onions in the sandwich (I guess there was some confusion as i didn't want them in the salad).  Yes, these are minor oversights, but i can't eat the meal without cutlery and the quinoa salad is super gross without the dressing.  Moreover, these are things that shouldn't happen with such frequency that something has been wrong with my order three times out of the last four or five orders.  I really, really want to make this location my go-to place, especially since it has decent seating and large, bright windows, but having to watch my food orders like a hawk to ensure they're made correctly is wearing me down.  I might just start going to the Eaton Centre location instead."}
{"text":"I like Aroma. It's nothing fancy, and can be a bit on the pricey side depending on what you're ordering, but it's a nice place to stop in for a quick bite or to order something to go (as opposed to the various fast food places like McD's and Burger King in the area). 

The downside is it's usually pretty busy, and can be quite packed on the weekends - sometimes we've had trouble finding a spot. 
I love the Aroma Ice (think a chocolate ice cap, only tastier and a little more on the \"icey\" side), and they offer both lactose free milk and almond milk. The almond milk costs $0.50 more, which is a bit of a bummer, but it's pretty tasty (plus I'm lactose intolerant). I'm not sure if the lactose free milk also costs more, but I'd guess it does.

They also have gluten-free bread available now, but I don't think there's an extra charge for that. I was SO excited to see a fast sandwich joint in my area with GF bread, I've been there twice in the last few days. The bread is pretty decent as far as GF bread goes (and a \"half\" sandwich still uses two full pieces of GF bread, so it's actually a decent size). 

I'm also a big fan of their salads, and although I have (obviously) not tried it myself, my boyfriend swears their potato bureka's are really amazing. He stops in quite often for one. Oh, and instead of asking for water, they have little cups available and a jug of flavoured water (think water with lemon or mint leaves soaking in it) for you to pour yourself."}
{"text":"Their Chai Latte is the best I've ever had. Legit."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend for a cup of tea. The server seemed conscientious when serving. It was a great place to chill. I would love to come back with my friends."}
{"text":"I came by the store while in the area, last time I was there must have been a few months ago. I was simply stunned at the customer service and hospitality I received. My coffee was amazing and fresh, as was my sandwich. The restaurant is under brand new ownership and the differences are crystal clear. Kudos to the new owners! I'll be coming here as often as possible. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  If I lived next to this cafe, I'd be spending my mullah on their lattes and mocha coffee!  I've also had their chocolate croissant.  Very good.. flaky and buttery just how I like my croissant!  And that lil dark chocolate they give you with your drink... mmmmmmm.... yum-y!

My only problem with this place is sitting.  Gets a little crowded with people taking up booths to spread their text books around to study.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"Overpriced/low quality food.  Coffees and lattes are decent but wouldn't recommend eating here as therr are plenty of other better options in the area."}
{"text":"A simple coffee place with a delicious breakfast. Best part is drinking Cortado after a long time which is a rarity in US."}
{"text":"I have gone to Aroma for both a casual lunch with co-workers and also a couple of meetings. The place itself is quite large with lots of tables and counter space for laptops. It's bright and funky and a cool new spot in Liberty Village.

The menu is quite small to read - which i always find annoying. The food is OKAY. The quinoa salad is over priced and bland. I haven't tried anything I'm in LOVE with except the hot chocolate...mmmmm very yummy! You also get a free little chocolate with most drinks."}
{"text":"This is for the Shakshouka enthusiast; I ordered hoping for an authentic Mediterranean dish, they served me a some sort of a tomato broth with fried egg inside a soup bawl, complete disappointment. The cashier was not friendly either"}
{"text":"The only problem for me and you, I guess, is that it's very cold inside in summer season. when I stop by here every time I need something to wear out of me. the others are great."}
{"text":"Aroma will always have a special place in my heart. When I went to Israel with my husband we ate at drank at Aroma a lot. When we saw that there were several locations in Toronto, we had to stop in. I ordered a delicious frozen drink and my husband had to order the mocha. Both did not disappoint! I will definitely come back next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with all Aroma Espresso Bar locations. I think they have some great products, but it's very hit and miss, and also very pricey for what you get.

This location takes the cake for the worst in my opinion - and I've been to a lot of them. I've visited this location 3x and each time has been bad. I keep going back expecting them to be better, but now I am done with my expectations.

My last visit, I ordered a turkey sandwich. It was extremely messy and the worst part was it was drenched in mayo. To the point where I got physically ill eating it. I'm not sure why someone would put that much anything on a sandwich, especially when you're trying to be a bit healthier by ordering turkey with veggies. Unfortunately it will be my last visit to this location and it has put a bad, mayo-like taste in my mouth for the entire chain. When I look at an Aroma now, I am reminded of how sick I felt after eating my sandwich."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food, and the place very run down. Came in for breakfast only to wait 5 minutes to be served. No one was in front of us yet they did everything possible not to serve us. When someone finally came to the counter, they served me, and walked away without serving my friend who had to wait even longer! The store was near empty. After a painful 12 minute wait for an egg sandwich, they served me half a sandwich instead of the whole I purchased! I then had to wait an additional 10 minutes for them to correct my order with no apologies or reimbursements. I expressed my frustration to the employee only to be quickly dismissed. Sandwich was cold to the touch, and was mediocre to say the best. Please see attached photos as that sums up my review."}
{"text":"I usually go to Aroma while heading to work, I make sure to have an extra 10-15 minutes to spare because there is usually a line up! The service is just OK, not consistent everyday, but to be fair they were training new staff. 

I ordered a small Americano with a shot of hazelnut and it's GREAT! And the price is good for what you get ($3.65 including tax).

The place is nice and has an outdoor patio witch is pretty cozy. You can definitely have coffee or go out for breakfast with a friend."}
{"text":"I spent way too much time in coffeeshops during my last trip to my hometown, and Aroma was frequently among them.

Location is definitely one reason- across from a Starbucks and a Second Cup, this place easily beats both. The large drinks come in huuuge indulgent mugs and the coffee is consistently good. The croissants leave something to be desired, but the alfajores are awesome. It's a big space so you shouldn't have too much trouble finding seating, especially when the patio is open"}
{"text":"Decent food, nice patio, friendly service, great coffee! Perfect place to go to breakfast or brunch.

Great place to hang out in the summer because they have a patio! This place is usually really busy especially during lunch and other peak hours. Nice place to get work done alone or hang out with others. Noise can be pretty loud though.

I ordered a small iced coffee. Pretty standard. Strong, flavourful, and not too sweet. They left nearly 2 inches from the top of the lid (there goes $1.50 worth of coffee LOL) but other than that, no complaints.

Can't wait to come back and try their teas and breakfast!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we meet there for breakfast and I wasn't disappointed.  The seating arrangement was pretty spacious both inside and out on their patio.   Their red seats and the decor was pretty cool.  

They offer a variety of specialty coffees and several basic menu items.  I ordered the french toast without the whipped cream.  Maybe it would have made a difference because the french toast was kind of dry.  Maybe the next time I visit, I will order something else.  But I'm not disappointed with the experience, nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love Aroma anywhere, but I wasn't expecting the one at Square One to be such a perfect spot for brunch. The proximity to the fountain outside makes it a very lovely spot to spend a Sunday morning, though I prefer the inside where it's cooler, but you can still see the outside and get lots of sunlight. Throw in a hazelnut iced aroma and you got a perfect start to a lazy day. 

The potato hash breakfast I got was delicious and fresh, served on a nice bed of arugula (with za'atar - a Mediterranean spice mixture - and yogurt), with a zingy lemon olive oil dressing on the side. It also nice bite-sized portions of chicken and turkey! 

The steak and egg half sandwich my bf got was also brimming with meat. I tried the roasted red pepper soup which always seems to be on rotation and it's like a slightly spicy, ultra-bold tomato soup. 

Glad to have a place at Square One that isn't just fast food and has great ingredients! :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of coffees and sandwiches. The Pistachio Latte was really good. I also enjoyed my sandwich which had pesto, tomato, and some amazing cheese I had never even heard of. I do love me some cheese!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience , i often go here for espresso with my family, they offer a very good carrot cake in slices and also some small pastries called alfajores that is delicious."}
{"text":"Pros - A delicious coffee place with great fresh sandwiches and salads.  The staff is helpful, and can customize food for you.  The desserts are delicious and fresh.

Cons - the place is busy most of the time and because of that there are major problems with seating, if you walk in and see a seat, try to put something on it before you order, or you may have to stand (not as much of a problem in the summer as there's outdoor seating)."}
{"text":"Always such rude customer service. staff make no effort to listen to your concerns with your order. 
Never take the time to explain what's in a order they just give you a menu and call next. 

I've been here twice and both times they have been extremely rude. 

On a positive note the coffee is great !"}
{"text":"We thought we were just going to Aroma for their coffee, but ended up ordering lunch.  My sandwich was delicious!  I didn't expect such goodness from a place that mainly specializes in coffee.

Coffee was perfect - very fresh, smooth and the right boldness.  The little treat that comes with the coffee is a nice touch.

I couldn't resist getting dessert after lunch.  I ordered a simple brownie from the counter, which I thought just had to be placed onto a plate for me.  To my surprise, Aroma goes that extra step and warms it for you.  It melts in your mouth.  We only got one to share and were fighting over the last bite.

It can get busy, so expect a wait if you go during peak hours.  Also, the tables fill up quickly so come early if you would like a seat.  Most customers seem to hang around for a while."}
{"text":"I really loved their Iced Mint Tea Lemonade. After a thirsty shopping spree, I needed a cool and refreshing drink. The eatery at Eaton's Center is the least zen-like place ever. I shudder coming here, as I get dizzy just looking at all the people. I have neither the energy nor aggressive attitude to bee-line towards a coveted table, and eak it out against 10 other people.

That being said, Aroma has their own little nook area and as my parents and I found a table, I saw a few other tables spare up. I like the concept - line up here to place your order and then move a bit to the side to pick your order up. 

I saw many people ordering their salads which comes in a sizeable bowl. Because I was going to be eating dinner soon, I opted for a cool Mint Lemonade which, at first, is sour, but then turns into icey sweetness. 

This place is a nice break from shopping."}
{"text":"Cortado is too hot. If you are a serious espresso bar, you should know that if you steam the milk too hot it ruins the flavour of the coffee."}
{"text":"Very poorly prepared espresso and older/staler beans. I was sorely disappointed. Tried a few of the places around this and was much more impressed"}
{"text":"This place surprised me, in a very good way. 

We ordered a coffee and cappuccino and grabbed a seat at the last available table (it was Saturday afternoon and the place was absolutely packed).

A minute or so after getting settled in they called our name to let us know our coffees were ready to be collected from the counter. To me, this seems like it would be an obnoxious way to let people know their order is ready but the place is busy enough that I didn't find it intrusive or obnoxious at all.

The little red chairs were incredibly comfortable (though I'd argue they don't look it).

The tipping point for me on this place was the little chocolates they serve with every hot drink (yum!) They chocolaty with a hint flavour. A perfect complement to any caffeinated drink. Even my dessert hating boyfriend loves them. 

Anyway great atmosphere, good coffee and incredibly convenient. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to another location, you know that Aroma is generally a nice place to go for some healthy, above-average food and drinks. Fast service, friendly staff, and always willing to make things right if something goes wrong. Sounds familiar right? Well, at this location you get none of that! Upon entering the store, the first thing I noticed was that all the chairs had massive rips all over them. It looked as if the owner had let his rottweiler run around the store one night and destroy everything in its sight. Terrible first impression. When I walked up to the counter to place my order (there was no-one in front of me), the gentleman, if I can even call him one, behind the counter treated me like a ghost and tended to everything else possible. He wiped the counters, cleaned the espresso machine, even asked other customers who were eating how their food was, all while never once looking in my direction. After about 5 minutes of putting up with his games, he eventually realized that his job description also includes serving customers, not just standing behind the counter pretending to look busy. After serving my friend, he quickly ran away to keep wiping the counter. His co-worker was so embarrassed by his lack of attention that she had to come out from the kitchen to take my order! It doesn't stop there though. My friend ordered a full-sized breakfast sandwich, only to be given a half portion. This required him needing to wait an additional 10 minutes for the second half to be prepared. When he complained about this and mentioned that the food should be free, the same guy who was wiping counters simply told him to go sit down and he would tell him when the food was ready. No apology, no offer of compensation, he just shrugged his shoulders and got back to looking like he was doing something productive. My french toast was stone cold and flavourless, and when the second half of his sandwich finally came, same story. For a place that prides itself on being \"better than the rest\", I'm shocked that the owner is okay with employing people who have no customer service experience or ability to understand when a situation is problematic; It probably reflects his own carelessness and attitude towards retaining loyal customers. Do yourself a favour and go to another location, unless you enjoy being served by children."}
{"text":"Awesome location. Great service and nice clientele! My goto place in the Annex for lunch on my way to work."}
{"text":"Say Hello to the first ever two story Aroma Espresso Bar located in the heart of Downtown Oakville! 

Located near Trafalgar and Lakeshore, this charming café offers a unique fresh experience to coffee enthusiast. The atmosphere is calm and cozy upstairs compared to the hustle and bustle downstairs. It's expected, this is the talk of the town right now. 

This is easily my new \"Go To\" cafe to chill out, surf the internet and enjoy a quality Cappuccino.

Drop by and experience great coffee, fresh and healthy food made to order, reasonable prices and warm contemporary décor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to Aroma on two separate occasions now, and I hope to be returning again regularly.

First time, I had their latte-and-croissant special. Delicious! I'm not usually a latte drinker as I'm very picky about how it tastes, but this was exactly what I wanted. Not too bitter, creamy with dense foam, and just the right colour. No sugar necessary! And the croissant tasted like a real croissant, the kind that takes three days to make, with a delicious eggy glaze. Never again shall I have cafeteria \"croissant\". Since everything is baked on-site, I knew that it was fresh too.

Second time I got a lemonade. Perfect, pucker-tastic lemonade. And I think I had a brownie, but it was more of a 

However, they do lose a star due to the fact that both times I was there some of the staff were visibly flipping out in front of the customers about who was supposed to be doing what. One time, no problem, bad day. But both times? You're going to lose good staff and good customers.

Not the cheapest coffee you'll get, but one of the best."}
{"text":"Convenient location, nice view of front yard of the condo's open area."}
{"text":"Sure, it all tastes good and love the cute chocolate...but I'm going to start bringing in No Frills and grocery flyers to show you how much food actually costs..because $9 for a salad?  $10 for half a sandwich?  And who eats half a sandwich??"}
{"text":"If heaven has sandwiches, the bureka treat would be one of them (minus the pickles, of course).

That is my go to sandwich and it's puff-pastry-feta-egg-tomato-tahini goodness! I introduced many people to this delicacy who are as equally hooked on it as I am. I also gave the cheese stick a try today which was just okay. A little bland."}
{"text":"Aroma is by far my favorite coffee shop in the area. There is a second cup but in my opinion it just pales in comparison to the quality, variety and selection that aroma offers. I eat here every morning and enjoy picking up the aroma cafe which is a chocolate coffee deliciousness every morning. Since I live in the area I have to point out that the owner Jason is a stand up guy, a true gentleman and very honorable to deal with. On one occasion I left my wallet at the store and he came to my house personally to deliver it. Thank you Jason and thank you all the staff at aroma."}
{"text":"Pretty okay place. I come here during lunch. The salmon sandwich is very good. I'm not a coffee drinker, but they look good. The desserts are VERY good however. Personally like the nanaimo bar and their brownies. Only qualm, during lunch can be very slow sometimes."}
{"text":"I still stick to the salmon sandwich here, it really is the second best thing on the menu. (Until they get rid of the Nanaimo bar, which is to DIE for) However, they still need to work on the speed of their food. It comes out relatively slow."}
{"text":"Visited Aroma today to meet with a friend over a coffee. Its an interesting space to say the least, you can tell that Aroma was at one time a really hip almost unique space before they started opening locations all over the GTA/Toronto. This particular location is not only well decorated but it attracts some .... well decorated people as well. If ya know what I'm saying.

It's the trendy kind of place where the wealthy 1% and those who want to look the part go to enjoy their lattes, trying to look socially conscious and less corporate by avoiding starbucks (even though that's where they really want to be) and go here \"to be seen\". I don't mock, I've lived around it my whole life so I accept this crowd - just don't ask me to explain them.

One thing that I thought was a bit low class for a space trying so hard to espouse class and sophistication in the 905, was their ordering system. You order at a cash desk and instead of waiting to pick up your order the announce your name over the loud speaker - kind of kitsch in my opinion. With this level of place I almost expect someone to bring it to my seat. I'm not a snob I swear....just think this place should maaayyyybbbbeee be more consistent in what they're going for.

Crowd aside the space is comfortable and free wifi is always a plus for those of us working remotely day in and day out like myself. But the most surprising thing here was the latte art (see picture). It was a pleasant surprise in a space like this and one of the coolest presentations I have seen in coffee in the GTA in some time.

Not all bad, will return, especially if they keep handing out the complimentary chocolates (aka Crack) with each coffee."}
{"text":"Consistent service throughout the years. Good coffee. No complaints."}
{"text":"Some people rave, I say it's pretty decent. Slightly above par. Slightly.

Unlike some coffee places, there is tons of seating, it's an open space AND they have free wifi! Just ask for the password at the cash! That was a definite bonus. It doesn't have that quiet coffee-shop feel though, if you're looking for a low key spot to unwind...

The staff is really friendly, and the selection of eat & drink is pretty good. I tried a hot chocolate upon recommendation and really, wasn't overly impressed. It was good, but not 'mind blowing' as I had heard. It's made in a cool way.... chocolate pieces at the bottom of the mug with hot milk you have to stir up yourself. Meh. 

I tried some sort of cheese danish (I think made with mascarpone) and it was actually delish. Fresh from the over, nice and warm and melty. The highlight of my visit. They looked to have other good pastry-type things that I would venture back to try. 

Other perks? They have an interesting tea selection, and have some cups with the loose leaf so you can stick your nose in and take a whiff! Because of the wifi it was a good place for a group meeting, so I would go back...and modify my drink order.

They take debit."}
{"text":"If you're always on the look out for a good mixed salad (w/wo meats) this is za place. Oh! and the beverages aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"I checked this place out because I had a coupon for a free coffee and a coupon for a $5 steak and egg sandwich. When I tried to redeem both I was refused and told that I could use only one coupon per visit. The manager pointed out the fine print, and explained that the purpose is to encourage customers to visit multiple times. I told him if he didn't allow me to redeem both then I would not return, and the manager stood his ground and refused the accommodation.
The sandwich was passable, but the customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. I certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good spot in liberty village, great patio to have a coffee. however it stops here

Prices are high enough to make starbucks seem like an affordable option

Example: The Aroma Power Breakfast Breakfast includes two eggs any style, mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, carrot, olives, feta cheese, cream cheese, avocado spread, and a side of our freshly baked bread with bread and butter. Add 1.50 for 12oz hot drink or soft drink.

you gotta pay an extra few $ for turkey bacon and you only get a slice and a half. Not what I would call a value-packed breakfast. 

They do get points for the consistent espresso/latte art with every drink. It's always consistently good. I'll return but not for awhile."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Aroma as a chain, just not this location.  Not very clean - saw a fairly large bettle move across the table where food orders come, bathrooms could use a refresh.  Food that didn't need to be made to order was a bit too tired ( I had a fruit salad I probably wouldn't serve guests if it was in my fridge).  Try Aroma, just a different location."}
{"text":"Great decor and atmosphere! also amazing drinks!! cool place to hang out! :)
can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This cafe chain is fairly consistent, offers a good variety of choice and in my personal opinion, better than the other larger chains like Timmies and Starbucks by far! 

They also give you a little chocolate with your order which may not be a huge deal but at least they are attempting to separate themselves from the competition and do something special for their clients."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst aroma I have ever been to. Someone needs to do quality control at this restaurant. All of the other aromas I have been to are clean and the food is consistent but this one was horrible."}
{"text":"I enjoy this coffee chain quite a bit.  I would have given more stars if it were not for 2 facts:  service too slow and oftentimes they get something wrong with the order...  also, pricey for what it is; cleanliness is off an on.
On the positive side, the Aroma special coffee is quite yummy, their salads and sandwiches are pretty good (warm chickpea salad and chicken sandwich are favs); their mini red velvet cupcakes are to die for.  :)  Servers are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss when it comes to customer service, but usually it's a \"miss\". Have encountered many staff members who seem quite disinterested in the fine art of customer service and would rather be playing on their iphones or thinking about their acting career. Only a previous manager who has since departed offered anything beyond acceptable. Too bad cause the food and beverages are actually pretty tasty, especially the power breakfast which is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Drinks are acceptable and free chocolate is a bonus. Spacious but noise level are always high. Bad music taste plus the volume was high, i still got distracted with my headphones on."}
{"text":"The location seems unusually dirty, tables were not wiped, floor uncleaned, and the self serve water glass still has lipstick and unknown stain on it! 

Ordered a warm grill chicken salad, which is my usual order at Aroma. Chicken came out hot and tasty, but the carrot shreds were very dry, and seems to be sitting in kitchen for quit sometimes 

Anyways, will not come back to this location ever again. Very disappointing compare to my past experience at other Aroma locations."}
{"text":"This location, on Queen St. at Augusta Ave., used to be a Second Cup before closing for several months. Aroma Espresso Bar took over the space and remodelled the interior to give a more modern European look. Aroma is a espresso and coffee chain from Israel that has expanded into Toronto with nine locations now. The look of the cafe is fresh and suits the location on Queen lending a nice alternative to the sometimes brash Starbucks and low brow Tim Hortons nearby. I stopped in to buy ground coffee and met the owners who were quite friendly and explained the coffee choices to me, and offered me discount cards for my next visit. I'm looking forward to going back during the daytime to try their coffee and maybe some of their baking which looked great in their display case."}
{"text":"Once upon a time when I lived in Toronto I always used to hang out at Aroma Espresso in The Annex. I remember Aroma as clean, great food, awesome drinks and perfect service - so naturally when I walked by this one on a recent trip to Toronto, I dragged my mom in for a cup of coffee.

Now... the food and coffee was absolutely fantastic. We ordered some tea and some cupcakes, and the cupcakes tasted moist and recently baked - delightful! I even saw one of the staff members in the kitchen putting some fresh pastry into the oven - I really appreciate a place that freshly bakes new treats over the course of the day. The tiny little chocolates that come with the drinks are always a welcome bonus.

The staff weren't as cheerful and friendly as I remember - they kind of stared at me blankly as I ordered, not really acknowledging what I was saying, which kind of made me wonder if I was doing something wrong.  The place itself? Oh dear. The bathroom was out of toilet paper and so messy that the person before me in line warned me before I went in... and apparently it had been like that all day. 

The little station with milk and sugar was in absolute shambles, and the water container was empty without any cups in sight. Keep in mind that this wasn't at the end of the day when they were packing up - this was midday!

Aroma is still a great place to grab coffee, but I think it's lost a little bit of edge. It used to feel like a cozy little place where you could easily become a regular, but on this particular day it felt more like a crappy chain with above average coffee."}
{"text":"Aroma sets itself apart from the other fast food restaurants in the Eaton Centre food court... literally.

I'm a big fan of Aroma but i'm on the fence about this location.

The good:
Separated seating from the other Eaton Centre food vendors makes it feel more secluded. The food is a healthy option when eating out.

The not so good:
This location is a little slower in terms of service. Food court is somewhat loud (not Aroma's fault).

I'm a bigger fan of the Aroma at Bay and Dundas (2-5 minutes walk away) as it's quieter and I find the quality of food and service slightly better."}
{"text":"Decent coffee shop with a better than average coffee shop menu (however, what is it with putting onions on everything?!) but the service at this particular location can be quite poor, with the staff not clearing dirty trays from the tables for hours. They can also ask you to move tables if they feel someone else should be seating at yours (no joke). Limited seating and the tall chairs are difficult to move, which means in 90% of the cases making a loud noise and bumping into the people next to you. OK overall but nothing out of the ordinary - don't really care to go back, even though I live in the area."}
{"text":"By far my favourite coffee shop! Food is always fresh and delicious. I always prefer their Aroma Coffee to any Starbucks or Second Cup"}
{"text":"This is a well-run Aroma with prompt and courteous service and always busy.
Nice spot on the busy Bloor St. strip near Bathurst beside the Hot Docs theatre. 
There is a Starbucks across the street so close you could use their wifi if you had to.
Best thing about this location is the copious amount of space. Plenty of room to move around, take your coat off and get a nice spot to park it while people watching.
Wrap around windows at a corner lot like this is what makes the place. Tall stools along the side overlooking the outdoor patio, and roomy tables with comfy chairs in both the front and back rooms. Bathroom made me want to get in and and GTFO. Solid coffee place on Bloor St.!"}
{"text":"The quality of food and drink here is on par with my review of the Bloor St location (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/aroma-espresso-bar-toronto#hrid:1iVAKo7CK8Jo9-njfGDuKA). The location here is convenient considering its position to Y&E and the subway, too. It can get a little hard to get a seat at busier times, because this location is smaller.

I feel I need to point out that the service at this location isn't as great as it is at the Bloor St store. While cash staff seem reasonably on the ball, I've had orders for coffee messed up on more than one occasion, which means I feel like I need to watch them like a hawk every step of the way when I visit now.

Otherwise - a decent coffee alternative to the 5 million Starbucks in the area."}
{"text":"I mainly go to Aroma for the coffee - it's the closest decent espresso place to go to from where I live, and it's definitely the best coffee on Bloor between Bathurst and Spadina. I think I drink more Aroma coffee than any other coffee in Toronto - not just to go, but also in the cafe itself.

While it can get busy, I don't think i've ever not been able to get a seat here. I've spent many hours sipping soy lattes and doing crossword after crossword watching the crowds go by on the street. The baristas there know what they're doing, and i've never not enjoyed a latte. I've also tried their mint tea and iced teas, both delicious. Their food selection seems to have good range. I've tried their quinoa salad only, but it was really great (I think it was the only already-vegan item on the menu, but there are one or two other salads and sandwiches which can easily be made vegan).

In short, don't think about going to any of the other coffee dives in this area - you'll get decent, efficient service, delicious beverages - and generally friendly baristas who are good at getting to know their regulars. That' a nice touch."}
{"text":"Giving it one star for hygienic reasons. Walked in 2 months ago and one of the workers kept coughing and covering his mouth with his hand...then handling the silverware and the food...grossed me out, never went back"}
{"text":"The website is pretty interesting as it describes their coffee drinks in scientific details i.e. temperature its served and frothing on the milk.
I mainly came here for my caffeine fix as I fall back to the popular chains when I can't find decent drinks.
The setup is nice and clean though a bit busy as it is part of the food court. Nevertheless they have a separate cordoned off area just for their patrons. They have a wide variety of drinks and food items. I was here mainly to try out their cappuccino so just placed an order for midsize version in a ceramic mug.
The sales person took down my name and said my drink will be ready for pickup at the next counter. Clean and efficient so far. I grabbed a seat and waited for my cappuccino. A few minutes later my drink was ready. The serving was in a nice warm mug (I would have preferred a cup). The milk was frothed nicely but not much in terms of latte art. The aroma was decent and I went ahead and took a first sip. I thought it would be a stronger brew but it was on the milder side (with a decent hit of espresso) The drink is somewhat between a traditional cappuccino and the modern version served by baristas that is catching on.
A decent cappuccino and I would rate it above the major chain that has popularized the coffee culture here in North America.
3.5 Star overall. Given a choice if I want a cappuccino I would come to this place in this area."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my hubby and I went to buy groceries at Longo's and stopped at Aroma Espresso Bar, our friends who live in the neighborhood mentioned that their coffee is excellent. We intended only to stop for coffee, but then realized that it's lunchtime and we both really hungry. Besides, their food menu was too tempting to be passed by. John got shakshuka (I think he just loved the sound of the name) and I got portobello mushroom sandwich. My sandwich was excellent and John liked his shaksuka, it is some kind of Moroccan/Israeli meal where you get sunny side up eggs floating on the top of spicy tomato paste with toasted bread on a side. Yes, coffee was good too, though I had better. It is 4 starts because the service was a bit slow (had to wait 15 minutes until they called my name) and the place was really crowded - there was no space inside and we had to sit outside even though it was windy and cold. Yet, the prices are reasonable and the food was good, so we will be back to Aroma again."}
{"text":"A fantastic espresso joint and a great place to meet up with friends. In fact, wanna know a little secret? I'm actually at Aroma right now writing this review. They've got free and unlimited WIFI. Awwwww yeeeeeah.

The location is convenient and the crowd is composed of families, couples, students, friends and elders alike.

The drinks are good, the food is delicious and their desserts are to die for. Try their chocolate muffin - OH MY GOD.

Their prices are reasonable for what you get and the presentation of the dishes/drinks is unique and appreciated.

Plus no matter what you order, you get a piece of chocolate with it - it's a very nice touch.

Aroma is one of my favourite coffee joints in Toronto. I'll be here all week ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped by Aroma while visiting Toronto this past weekend. Amazinh spot. The place was bustling. There was a bit of a wait, but the line moved quickly. The espresso was the best I've had and only surpassed by the piping hot chocolate croissant. The staff were friendly and pleasant and dealt with the rush well. I only wish I lived in Toronto, this would be my go to spot."}
{"text":"I've stopped by Aroma a few times now, and always delighted in their vegetarian sandwich options. I keep forgetting the names of the ones I've tried, but I always end up happy. This location has a great number of tables and seating. It's always frustrating to arrive at a coffee shop and have nowhere to sit.  I wish there was a location near where I work - it'd make for a great lunch destination. Few places offer quality espresso and sandwiches, which will ensure Aroma's success."}
{"text":"Came into this coffee place because the name aroma just pops. Situated in the food court it looked very busy and crowded. 

The seating areas were messy and the tables weren't wiped down. If I were the owner I would have someone look at the seating areas to ensure they're clean and condiments are fully stocked. 

The smell of this place was like a symphony with notes of a good roast and sweet delights. I ordered the \"aroma\" latte which consists of white mocha, espresso, mocha and a hint of vanilla. The taste of the espresso had a light fruity flavor with a smooth and rich taste of acidity. I give the barista an A+. If it's not for their delicious roast I would come back when the place cleans after itself."}
{"text":"This chain of cafes impressed me quite a bit for their java drinks as I would rate them on the higher end of the spectrum as far as franchised operations are concerned. 
The setup is decent with a nice open feel, plenty of seating and apparently a patio that I would luv to come back to in summer. 
I went for a cappuccino and my friend had a sandwich. There are a lot of options for food as he had to spend quite a bit of time just going through the list of offerings. 
The cappuccino was decent and consistent with the offering at the other locations I have tried. 3.5 stars for that.
Now for the sandwich my friend enjoyed it and said he will come back for more."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this location was when it first opened. As the years have gone by, this location has gotten worse. 
First of all, it is extremely dirty now. The floors look like they haven't been cleaned since day 1. The tables are always dirty and sticky, and the windows also look like they don't get cleaned at all. I'm not even going to start about the bathrooms.... 
Secondly, the staff is not very friendly. 
Last but not least, the pastries that are set up on the display also look like they've been there since day 1. They do not look fresh AT ALL. 
Overall, Aroma does have the potential to be a nice cafe that people go to, to relax and get a coffee. But over the years, it has gotten way too dirty to be able to even enjoy being in that environment. I can only get coffee to go, because I just don't enjoy being there at all."}
{"text":"Just you regular coffee shop. No fancy frills. 

Lots of seasonal drinks to pick from! The tiramisu drink was good, just don't let the biscuit sit there for too long, otherwise it just dissolved into the drink!

The servers/baristas all seemed quick and nice.

They also have free wifi, but it doesn't seem to work."}
{"text":"Trendy. Diner meets coffee shop. Loved window seating on the 2nd floor."}
{"text":"This aroma is finally open! I'm so glad there is finally a decent food option so close to where I live. The aroma is conveniently located by the ferry terminal and also in the RBC tower, Delicious salads, sandwiches, lattes and desserts! I will definitely be visiting this location quite often especially in the summer as the patio is huge! Can't wait to go back and get a mini red velvet cupcake!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Had the doubleup combo with grilled chicken breast sandwich and red lentil soup. Soup was great, the sandwich exquisite. It can get crowded at the counter (i.e. you can't tell where the line is for ordering and for pickup), but it moves fast and you can take a seat after ordering until they call your name (convenient!). One thing I like is they have multiple exits and you don't have to go around or squeeze between people to get in or out (little trivial things can impress people). Pretty good meal as lunch at a solid price ($20 for two). Will definitely come back here, and will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Even though I've always gotten a seat for myself (and a friend) whenever I've visited Aroma, I always felt really lucky. There seems to always be more people coming in than leaving! The service is REALLY friendly, and the environment is super warm and inviting. You can come alone or with a friend, and with the great music playing in the background you don't have to worry about being \"too loud\" (usual coffee shop worry for some). My favourites are their steak sandwiches, their AMAZING hot chocolates &their absolutely lovely chocolate croissants!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting this Aroma for about a year and I am consistently disappointed with the quality of the service. Our experience today was shocking - it took 25 minutes for the team to make two salads. The owner really needs to improve the quality of the team he's hired to run this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes, Aroma is a really good place to kiss your money goodbye on coffee, but they do offer some food items other almost-equally overpriced coffee joints can't: 

- shakshouka (sunny side eggs in a bowl of tomato sauce that you will think is weird but will love after tasting it)
- Aroma's secret bread recipe trumps even gourmey bakeries, and sandwiches coming out of this bread (avocado omg) are deliciouuuuusssss
- orchid latte, a heavenly piece of creation (too bad it's only seasonally available)"}
{"text":"A problem with the Bay Street neighborhood is that a lot of people do not recognize it as a true neighborhood and it has a hard time acting like one. Currently blighted by construction, with high rent for retail businesses, the only sort of operation that appears to be able to survive here are the franchises, many of which are ageing concepts and not very warm and inviting.   

I like a good cup of coffee, but I am tired of Timmys and Starbucks and the Second Cup.     

One bright spot in the local landscape is the recently opened Aroma Expresso bar, at 1110 Bay St. (at Charles).   This is a franchise, but it also has the positive, lively atmosphere of family owned mom and pop operation.   It is also attracting a desirable demographic: students and sensible young urban professionals (does such a thing exist ?)       

Service is quick and efficient, the servers are polite, the owner friendly. The coffee is strong and of really good quality. The pastries are really good .  The space is rather angular, but clean and bright.    This place is a welcome addition to the area.

Now I must get back to the The Save-A-Soul Mission....."}
{"text":"Had soup salad, choc milk with ice drink, Cappuccino, everything was delish!!! Best meal. Never been and would def go back."}
{"text":"Saddest BLT I've every had, with cold packaged deli meat and burnt fake-looking bacon. Way to expensive for what it was.

Lemon mint ice tea decent."}
{"text":"Great coffee and nice staff. Just order a healthy breakfast and have a seat upstairs to relax and enjoy in the heart of Old Oakville. All meals seem to come with plenty of veggies to make it a well balanced meal and delicious."}
{"text":"I like aroma, it's definitely a good coffee shop and a better  chain. There brewed coffee is pretty meh in my book but I do love heir Americanos! And boy oh boy  he barakas!!! I can't get enough!! Super central location, I go here relatively often when dT and needing a good caffeine boost!"}
{"text":"Always the best light breakfast. So much better than the regular greasy spoon brekky. Feel great and ready to tackle Sunday. Chocolates are a nice touch"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place! Was so happy to visit Toronto and find \"Aroma\" downtown. The freshly baked bread, the selection of bread and cheeses, The real vegetable salad, freshly made on the spot! Perfect breakfast- you can't go wrong.  Ah yup. There is also a coffee!!"}
{"text":"I only came in for an iced brewed coffee. The service was lovely. The girls who served me were patient and smiley. I enjoyed that. A very non-intimidating environment for a first timer. 
My iced coffee was $2.70. It came unsweetened. I like that- I'm fussy about how sweet I like my drinks, and I usually find most wayyyy too sweet for me. 
I came at around 3:30 on a Friday- no lineups although plenty of people were there working and relaxing."}
{"text":"If you have a big butt, you better have more than 3 people with you, because you won't fit into any of the seats available.

My really expensive, fancy hot chocolate was room temperature at best.  Too bad, I love this chain normally."}
{"text":"Hmm...

This area is kinda devoid of grab and go options like pizza so when I needed a bite before a class, it was either this or Starbucks. 

I usually avoid Aroma because I find it hella $$$$ but I was desperate. It was $9 for a Canadiano (like an americano but more bitter) and a piece of mediocre Carrot Cake. 

The sandwiches looked good but again they are a bit on the pricey side. While I appreciate that they are made to order , it's also tough when you just want to grab and go."}
{"text":"My Canadiana was nice too bad I couldn't say the same about the service.  3 ladies behind the counter and this was around 9:45am in the morning on a Thursday.  It wasn't busy nor was there a lineup.  I was preparing for a meeting with material in hand and soon to have coffee as well.  As you can see I had my hands full and I had asked the lady if she could take the coffee to go so she unfolds the carry out cardboard and I asked if I could have a lid...2 ladies both at the same time said go over there to get...even though it wasn't busy and I could see the lid right in front of her...like OMG!  Anyways this is a place I won't frequent again even if they have good coffee."}
{"text":"So the menu is the same as all other Aromas: great coffee, AMAZING DELICIOUS PERFECT steak sandwich -- this is literally the best thing you'll ever eat, free ice water.  So for the menu I give it a 4/5, because I absolutely adore almost everything I get from Aroma.

My rating is based on this specific location: atmosphere, lay-out, etc.  It's definitely less \"comfy\" feeling than the other Aromas.  Seat layout is strange - four good booths but the rest of the seating is awkward.  Music they were playing was quite good.  Single stall washroom was clean.  Service was good (I ordered the sandwich and my friend and I each got a coffee; she asked if we wanted the coffees right away or wait for the sandwich to be ready).  I just didn't feel the space was as inviting as the other Aromas.  Felt a little cafteria-ish."}
{"text":"Pretty standard coffee. It's not bad or amazing just average. I will give it that it has better food than other chain coffee shops. It has a convenient location here right outside subway and nice speciality drinks."}
{"text":"Great food and very good service - staff are super friendly!! Highly recommend paying a visit and trying the Philly Chicken sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the food Aroma serves is quite good, albeit a little overpriced. It's awesome to have a cafe that serves authentic Middle Eastern and Greek food.

They also have a very friendly staff. Moreover, the seating and general atmosphere is nice.

Other than being a tad bit overpriced, Aroma's only other problem, from my point of view, is that they have a too limited menu of drinks to choose from. This is especially true for me, since their more interesting coffee drinks don't have the option of coming in decaf.

Overall though, if you're looking for a nice cafe to sit down in, this place sure beats Starbucks and most Second Cups."}
{"text":"Out of all the Aromas I've been to, this location makes the BEST Iced Aroma Light. It is creamy and delicious, whereas at other locations it looks like watered down brown slush. The classic breakfast is also to die for - I crave their multigrain bread all the time. The only negative is that the service can be slow at times, even at 9am on a weekday when there is no line up."}
{"text":"Went there 4 times this weekend since it was right next to the place we were staying.  Solidly decent coffee and delicious smelling breads.  The staff was never very friendly.  Maybe they're too hip?  Maybe they just hate their lives?  Either way, it's totally a fine place if you're in a hurry.  Otherwise, go a few blocks down and eat a proper brunch with a cup of regular coffee."}
{"text":"The type of establishment I would avoid/abhor if it were a chain in B.C., but as a tourist in Ontario the novelty factor got the better of me. Most of the staff have a putting-on-this-smile-'cause-I-have-to expression, but were friendly enough. And they didn't mind at all when the bulldozer-dog I'm taking care of tore through her leash and came charging in after me, much to the surprise and entertainment of everyone there. Great brewed iced coffee; I like the red lids. 3 1/2 stars!

(Also, this wasn't the exact location I visited, but something tells me they're all the same)"}
{"text":"For a chain, this place is quality. When in the neighbourhood I'd choose aroma over the starbs or second cup any day. Similar pricing but waaaaay better quality speciality drinks and choices for food which is made fresh. I'm w big fan of there pastries which they can warm up doe you as well. It fast service for a nice treat and coffee at there many locations!"}
{"text":"I always take a double espresso or house blend coffee. I find the espresso a bit stronger than Starbucks (which is a good thing), and it's also less bitter too. It's a nice touch that they give a chocolate every time you buy something. No coffee breath afterwards"}
{"text":"I hate to give Aroma Espresso Bar the 2-star treatment because I like those little Chocolate Chip Cookies, but I decided to give a shot into their breakfast offerings.

Got myself the Classic Breakfast. Now, you get turkey bacon, which I actually love more than regular bacon, but I'd expect full strips of bacon. Instead they serve you 1.5 slices where they've cut full slices in halves and each half constitutes a slice. And to boot, the bacon didn't have the slightest browning. Also, you get four large slices of bread but only one packet of butter. But I really enjoyed the toast.

All for $10??? Not worth it."}
{"text":"So the secret to this location is come before the mall opens . Its peaceful you get whatever seat you want and they are not rushing your food. Im.not sure of thats a good thing or bad but thats what I do, its relaxing to me"}
{"text":"I came to this aroma and it's much smaller than the ones I'm used to. I found it quite dirty. The floor had food and wrappers on the ground. I think they really need to sweep the floor at least once in the middle of the day. 

The service was good. The lady working was very friendly and our drinks arrived in a timely manner. 

It was nice that this location is kosher. It really attracts the right demographic but compared to the other Aromas, I could not get over the dirty floor was. 

Would I go back to this location? No, I would not. I would rather go to the other locations that are much more clea"}
{"text":"On Sunday Nov. 20 I ordered 2 gluten free sandwiches. When I came home, the bread was totally burnt. I contacted themright away and spoke to the kitchen manager, Siva, who was extremely rude and only after my challenging him said I could get 2 free sandwiches when I come in next and to just mention his name. I was not happy with how he spoke to me, so I contacted the store manager, Nadia, who said that he is a very nice person, and confirmed that I could get 2 free sandwiches and if I have a problem to just call her. She gave me her cell phone. Today I decided to claim those 2 free sandwiches, I called the store to explain, Siva wasn't there, so I asked them to contact Nadia so that they could hear from her that I could get them. They called me back and said that she is not there so she cannot prove anything, however, I already spoke to her, and she gave me the number to contact her if she is not there. After that, I tried calling her, and her phone rings once or twice and then just goes to voicemail. I had asked for a credit note or for the staff to be notified but this wasn't done. I paid for two sandwiches that I couldn't eat, and I still had to go through such an uncomfortable demeaning experience Why it be so difficult for me, as a customer, who was given the wrong food? I find that other coffee chains that are run by Head Office, such as Starbucks, to be a much more positive experience. This is extremely unprofessional, and I am extremely upset with Aroma for this very poor customer service, especially on Hannukah."}
{"text":"I love Aroma, and this one is my fave because of the great location. I frequent it when I am at work for a healthy lunch or a tea. Comparing Aroma to other coffee shop chains: the coffee is decent, the tea selection is wonderful, the food would have to be the best, especially the salads, and the bread is baked fresh in-house (I think Aroma is huge competition now to Starbucks particularly because of the food). I LOVE the lentil soup. Some items are on the pricier side, i.e. half sandwich is $5, however, I do love the option of actually getting half a sandwich. The pastries are okay, and if I really feel like something sweet Ill get one of the muffins or the cheese danish. All nice coffee shops are pricey, but at least you can get healthier, delicious options here for food."}
{"text":"So slow - bad service - staff don't care. I have given this place 3 chances - I will not go back. I"}
{"text":"This was my first time at an Aroma establishment and I was pleasantly surprised with everything from their wide selection in beverages and food, exquisite, friendly and prompt service and everyone's general demeanour in the cafe. 
I sat in their outdoor seating area and took note of how tidy they kept everything (staff coming around at least every half hour clearing empty plates/mugs). The food that people ordered look fresh and carefully prepared, and everyone's beverages (mine included looked delicious. Prices were quite affordable too!
I will definitely visit again for a relaxing computer date or lounge with friends!"}
{"text":"Living in Liberty has its perks. Aroma Mediterranean espresso bar is one! 

My go to for all day healthy breakfast and lunches and delicious drinks!! Staple in this neighbourhood. Their patio is dog friendly too which is a bonus!! One of the servers there actually came out with a giant silver dog bowl filled with water for my chihuahua. It was bigger than she was!  

The Iced Lemon mint slush is my fave. Actually tastes like a mojito! 

The shakshuka is amazing. It comes with a yummy tahini sauce. One of the best brekkie dishes out there. I also highly recommend the hash with chicken and turkey. It's quite filling and the plain yogurt that comes with it makes an awesome wholesome pairing. Both dishes come with a sunny-side-up egg as well for some added protein! 

Great patio and even better food! People watching at its finest! Hehe"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Marriott across the street so visited a few times.  Great quality coffee and pastries, nice sitting area, and good menu selections.  Deco is nice and tends toward the upscale side, and place is neat and clean.  Worthy of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this location two days in a row while taking a course in the building. Service was fast, friendly and the staff are knowledgeable about the menu. Food quality was good, the lentil soup was excellent. 
The space is large and clean. Even though I visited during the busy lunch hour it didn't feel crowded and seating was easy to find. 
What sets this location apart from other Aromas that I've visited is the service. Everyone is friendly, menu suggestions are made in a helpful way and interactions are genuine. Kudos to the man working behind the bar who consistently addressed people by their name, remembered repeat customers and followed up to make sure you enjoyed your meal. 
Great option for a good, quick meal in this area."}
{"text":"Best Coffee and Breakfast place in the neighborhood 
Good Nice Atmosphere and good signal WIFI."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I've only tried one thing from Aroma's menu. So I'm going to make this short and sweet (like me!)...

**Probably the best latte I've ever had!** Oooh and it comes with a cute little chocolate treat. Now, how awesome is that?! Very!"}
{"text":"The the drinks are okay and overall I am a big fan. But the service quality and speed is unbearable.
Avoid having a quick coffee meeting here, you'll wait in line for 15 to get a cup."}
{"text":"I am not sure if the concept of toast is really understood here. They get bread, but the process of converting bread to toast seems to have escaped the crew here. Additionally the idea of seasoning also appears to be an unknown. After returning a tray with a 95% uneaten \"everyday breakfast\" I shudder to think that there may be people eating this food everyday. Coffee is passable and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I usually go to Aroma if I want a coffee on the go or a little treat guilt free. 

Aroma has a pretty consistent standard when it come to ingredients and food preparation. 

Where I think it's lacking of is a standard when it comes to serving from behind the counter. Some locations are much faster than others and this one, unfortunately, isn't so much fast considering that the place was at 75% of its full capacity. 

However the quality of the service experienced was good. The employee was cordial, attentive and when came across to the situation where a special voucher needed to be used as a reward for checking in, she managed to find out how the system works despite she wasn't aware in first place. 

Overall, great location, fresh ingredients and a good quality of the service made this pit stop a pleasurable experience. 

3 stars only because of the speed caused either by the speed of operations from the employees or most likely because not staffed enough. 

I would return without a doubt."}
{"text":"One of the many reason why you choose to buy one sandwich or a drink vs. another is mainly driven by the quality of the food. And to this point, Aroma, does it right. 

Now, for this location, I believe that Aroma can only get awarded with a 3 stars.
And again, this is possible only because of the quality of the food.
Aroma, I have to say, quality wise, seems to care about that and so, it makes sure that each location must meet the expectations. And each location does.

But the choice of a place over another is not only about the food.
It's about service, cleanliness, tidiness and the state of the furnitures and common areas.

Well, with this location, I might have a problem or two:
- the centre tables: I find them to be too high and uncomfortable to sit at to enjoy a bite and a drink. Also, the state of one of the leather seat of one of the booths, is so worn out to the point that there is a hole in it (so, at this point, the more people will seat on it the more the hole will expand until it'll \"conquer\" the whole space). 
- the service: this is something I have noticing that is getting worse time after time. Not very impressed with my last few visits since it appears that behind the counter we are dealing with employees that are clearly not happy (not all of them but some, and these were the ones in the front line). There were no more spontaneous greetings, no smiles or at least the effort in making their presence less visibly bored or even worse, annoyed.

Someone can have a bad day, I get it, but it can't be a coincidence that 3 out of 3 visits in the last few weeks ended up to be similar to each other one.

I love Aroma, and I hope some of the slack will be picked up. You guys are sitting on a gold mine. Make sure you keep it this way otherwise you might wake up one day and discover that what you thought it was gold, is now copper."}
{"text":"Hi I am giving a thumbs up to the Yonge street location for the service both in the past and, present and, to an ownership that is amazing. Happy Easter to you all, this includes the management team!!."}
{"text":"Gotta love this Aroma Espresso Bar. Convenient location, good baristas, great espresso. Their Mocha Coffee is my latest discovery - melted chocolate pieces in a cup of hot milk with shots of espresso. What can be better than that? I also love their sweets - chocolate croissant, carrot cake, you name it. Good sandwiches also, with unconventional ingredients. This is the place for my espresso fix."}
{"text":"Ok, so I decided to go to a cafe and read ..while enjoying the nice sunny breezy weather before my Saturday yoga class. I stopped by Aroma, remembering the Cafe Latte was delicious, and thought I would give the food a try. First, I need to talk about the service. As i mentioned in my previous reviews, I am not sure if it is me or what.....the staff just  always seem very neutral toned. They are not unfriendly, but not friendly or helpful either.....not that they don't have eye contact, but I  never know who or what they are looking at.  Anyhoo I decided to try the French Toast(my ultimate favorite for brunch), and the staff asked if me if I wanted anything to drink. While i frantically look at the menu, she just blankly stared at me....no help with making suggestions. So I picked Cafe Latte since there was a line behind me and I felt pressured.  I didn't really know what was suppose to happen next...was I suppose to move down the line and wait for my food, or was my food was going to come to where I am sitting. When I asked, again...not sure if there were eye contact, the staff responded in neutral tone - just go over there and wait for us to call your name.  

Another weird thing was ...I kept hearing the staffs whispering..French toast..I don't think we have this or that. So anyways, I finally got my order....the French toast was good, but I had better. With all the whispering going on, it made me think if I got the normal French toast or this was just scrambled last minute French toast. 

Cafe Latte as usual was great.  Overall experience....it's a trendy cafe with great cafe latte...the food is good, like their service, not the best ..but it's good. Neutral would exactly describe it!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! It is on a busy corner of downtown Oakville. The space isn't big despite there being two floors, so it is sometimes difficult to find seating. 

I have been to this location multiple times. Sometimes I stop in to get a London fog latte while I'm out shopping and other times I sit down for lunch. Aroma makes my favourite London fog latte. Something about it is a little different than other places make it. Keeps me coming back again and again. 

Love the grilled portobello sandwich! Very tasty. Love that sun dried tomato spread. The bread is so fresh! The sandwich is delicious and filling. 

The iced lemon mint is refreshing and really nice on a hot summer day. It came highly recommended by a staff member.

Aroma is a busy place, but the staff members handle it like champs and never stop smiling. Great little spot in downtown Oakville."}
{"text":"A good sandwich and coffee option in the Y&E area. 
Not something i'd crave necessarily, but fairly reasonable and standard"}
{"text":"Holy moly. 

I got takeout from this place two days in a row. Day one: half soup and salad meal. Day 2, salad.

Both were incredible and incredibly huge. They have a poster outside the place that says that nothing is premade, the salads and bread are all cut and chopped when you order. I believe them. These were the freshest salads i've ever had outside my house, and the soup (chicken and wild rice) was really great. 

Plus, the portions are gigantic. The \"small\" salad easily yielded two meals. 

The service is also quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"They arrived on the scene in 2007, the same year that I went to Aroma for the first time in Israel. Since then, there have been branches opening all over the city and I'm pleased for them. While independent coffee shops are the ideal, if we're talking about chain cafes and limited options in the downtown working core, Aroma is cool beans. I would like to fight for Second Cup in this battle since they are Canadian, but I just can't do it because unfortunately, zzzz...

I think the reason I like Aroma so much is because since this is an Israeli company they have more interesting (and tasty) Mediterranean offerings. What snack would you rather eat with your hot bevvy? Another banana nut muffin from Starbucks... oooor a hot cheese bureka?   

During the cooler months, the red lentil soup (served with bread) is one of my quick lunches if I'm at work (it's also pretty easy to make btw). It's delicious, filling (don't even need the bread), very healthy and not too pricey. Another healthy staple is the Aroma Special salad (comes with a hard-boiled egg and tuna or feta) or the Warm Chickpea salad (served with lemon olive oil dressing and tahini on the side) and in the past, the Ice Lemon Mint and Ice Aroma Light have been my usual Aroma summer drinks."}
{"text":"I remember when I first heard about Aroma coming to Canada-- I thought:  \"It couldn't get any better than this!!... and to top it off, it's a hop, skip, and a jump away from my neck of the woods!\"  Then slowly, more locations starting popping up around the GTA.. and so the inevitable happened...

Aroma quickly went

....

Aroma is not the Aroma I remember many years ago... This place overcharges for food that has gone down in quality over the past few years.  Their coffee is nothing to rave about, however I would choose it over Tim's coffee any day... But they're more expensive than Starbucks so be prepared to shell out some cash.

The last time I visited Aroma, it was last week in the middle of a hot, sticky, summery day.  Excited about my Iced Aroma light, I hastily walked into the restaurant, waited 10 minutes in line only to find out that they ran out of the powder used to make the Iced Aromas.  I was quite upset to say the least.. I mean, put a sign on the door... SOMETHING!

I digress...

The patio is nice, the decor is inviting, but the food quality has definitely gone down within the past 1.5-2 years.  To top it all off, my Iced Aroma cost me over $5 for a small, which is more than a Frappuccino at Starbucks.  

To conclude, if you're looking to spend astronomical prices for mediocre food, then this is the place to be.  I suggest saving your money, and putting it to better use."}
{"text":"To test out Aroma I had a coffee.  Not a latte, not a capp, just a regular coffee.  It was pretty good!  Not as scalding as I like it, but it was a good cup of coffee.  

I also had a alfajores.  What a great cookie!  It has a unique consistency.  The outer cookie is almost like a softer shortbread.  The creamy filler just matches it up nicely.  Not too sweet, just right.

Did not \"drink in\".  The chairs don't seem to match the place (in my humble opinion).  Busy spot, quite packed.

I am excited to go back and try their cafe au lait.  Not many places serve cafe au lait - so already Aroma has won bonus points with me."}
{"text":"I must say I'm very disappointed. I love Aroma in general, but this location was a nono. First of all, there were a total of 5 pastries and they all looked really old. They were all combined into one plate in the refrigerator section. I wonder, if you have so much space, why not fill at least half?!

Second, I ordered a \"tiramisu\" latte which tasted like watered down coffee with a dash of milk. No taste. Seriously, such a waste of $. I didn't even drink 3/4 of it. There was one lady working there, and she also looked like she was half asleep.

Honestly, for the price, step your game up."}
{"text":"This is a new aroma cafe near north york centre station. It has a lot of windows, which makes the entire store bright and sunny. The coffee is just as good as all the other aroma locations. The only downside is that when the patio is closed (rain/snow), the store gets packed and it is difficult to find a seat. Otherwise, this is a great place to study or meet with friends."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised because their food is pretty decent and their decaf coffee tastes really great. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Espresso con panna is where it's at. 

I've been to this local a bunch of times and have tried a few things. Their house brew is quite tasty, as are their breakfast sandwiches. I normally go here because it is close to home and is a nice change from the university library. But! You have to get there early to secure one of the few tables with access to outlets if you plan to work! 

Aside from the lunch rush, this local stays pretty quiet."}

Aroma Espresso Bar: a haven for foodies & coffee addicts

Aroma Espresso Bar: a haven for coffee addicts & foodies 10:45 AM | 15 June, 2010  

When I first spotted Aroma Espresso Bar at the Promenade Mall location (probably around April), I noticed that the pricing for the food was probably more than what I'd be willing to pay for, but I really needed a coffee break at that time. First things I noticed: freshly baked loaves of bread, and the sound of espresso being freshly ground and brewed as it should be--not the way they brew espresso at Starbucks or Second Cup for that matter--they grind the old school way! I also love how everything is absolutely immaculate and the staff are courteous & professional, knowing that a customer's needs are important. Milk for their lattes & cappucinos are done with whole milk (unless specified otherwise), allowing for a richer, creamier taste; poured over the full bodied espresso with care and finesse. I also have to admit that having a dispenser containing water with lemons and plastic cups on a tray indicating to help yourself is a fantastic idea--it'll definitely keep you hydrated while you wait for your order to be filled. There is no doubt that the ambience & atmosphere allows you to know that it's a more upscale cafe, with a lot of healthy food choices all prepared to order. I haven't managed to sample any of their food, but based on my experience in the Hospitality industry (I do cook, you know!), my nose doesn't lie when it smells something great that also looks incredibly appetizing. As I finish writing this from their Bathurst & Rutherford location (9320 Rutherford Road), I have to say that Aroma Espresso Bar is a real delight and in the last 7 (almost 8) years, I never thought I'd find a place that I love just as much as Starbucks & Second Cup for satisfying my coffee fix."}
{"text":"One of my best friends loves Aroma. I... just don't see it. Obviously my own personal opinion but I just don't. although they do have good coffee.

You see, I generally don't like chains. Since there is always a \"drink your coffee and get the heck out vibe\" expressed in the layout, seating, quality of seats, and overall décor. You can pick it up once you compare it to other Cafes like 7 West, CSI Cafe, The Buttler's Pantry or Queen Mother and yes, I do understand these chains are meant to be utilitarian at best. The food here is... is... well, honestly, I do not care. I would never buy anything from here unless I was hypoglycemic, my pupils were dilated and was heading towards paralysis. I would call it: MEH² 

As the main people you will see here are people ordering to go, the odd informal get together or laptop hobos. 

I am also very biased as I do not like Liberty Village as a place to live. As an urbanite who sold his car ages ago, I find Liberty Village cumbersome. It is an island of condos and admittedly some nice industrial buildings being Ménage à trois by the QEW on the south and a major train artery to the North. So there are not that many exists of this mortar and brick wasteland. Aside of course the streets at the both ends. 

No insult to people who work here. Work is work. 

Anyway, I digress, if you are not from the hood there is absolutely no reason for you to come to this tiny location even in the Summer. The patio is not worth the trip. 

If you need to go to an Aroma go the one in the Annex. It is larger, bit nicer and more accessible."}
{"text":"Fun fact, there are some locales in Toronto that I could swear are *cursed.* Not because of some horrible poltergeist or existential issue. No, it is simply because the locale is so poorly located/designed that almost everything that opens hardly gets past the 6 month mark before it goes out of business. 

For example, the locale on the northwest corner, west of Bathurst and Bloor. It went from a McDonald's,  to being closed for ages, to a Chinese restaurant, to a Latin Bar, then to a Latin/Sports bar to another nameless Asian place to now a Japanese (possibly Fusion) place. There is also another place in Scarborough that has been 5-6 restaurants in about 6 years. 

So Aroma was one of those places. There use to be a bar there for ages, and when it went under, the building looked so much like a nondescript office building that anything that went there would have to blow a lot cash in order to have a profitable business. As they would have to change EVERYTHING about the place. That is the only way to break the curse. Stick in very large amounts of cash to remodeled the entire place and hope it pays off in the end.  

Well, they did just that and it surely has paid off. 
It looks nothing like it did before!

It is a very modern looking cafe, with lots of dark browns, blacks and some nice red accents. This locale has tons of seating and as such it is always packed. They also have free WIFI(!) and it is be the location for my friends and I to chill on a Sunday afternoon while chatting tech & life talk. While warming up on lattes and sharing the funniest video/story of the week on our laptops. 

The drinks are good although a bit expensive, however they become irrelevant as the location/decor provide a more than ample place for friends to meet and chat. More so than any snobby, burnt tasting Starbucks. 

This location, steps away from a subway station and it's excellent ambiance make it for the place to go when looking for a cafe in the hood. Although it might be a little too low-key for a coffee date, so for that go elsewhere, like Insomnia, across the street. But for a hangout with friends, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Gahhh Aroma... employ people that will provide better customer service!

I was coming from work and I passed up Starbucks (which was literally across the street) so that I could try out Aroma. This Aroma location is horrible.

I walked in and there were a couple of people standing at the bar waiting for their drinks to be served. I was standing by the cash register, waiting for the cashier to notice that I was ready to order, but it took her about 2 minutes and my arm flagging her down for her to realize that I wanted something. 

I decided to get the ice lemon mint and a cheese danish. Now, I received my cheese danish immediately after I ordered, but my ice lemon mint didn't come until 10 minutes after I ordered it. Turns out, the very slack staff decided not to make it until I asked them about it. It just blows my mind that there were literally 2 other people in the place besides me, and they could not be bothered to serve anyone. They also moved slower than a snail and just had no sense of urgency. 

Anyways, the cheese danish was alright. It was a bit too flaky and dry for my liking, but there was a lot of cheese which was good. As for the ice lemon mint, it was sitting for way too long before it was served to me (again, because the staff have no sense of urgency) so the blended ice and the lemon mint part separated and it wasn't pleasant. 

I really wanted to like this location because it's so convenient, but it's just not going to happen. I'll take the 10 seconds to walk across the street and grab something from Starbucks.  

Plus: The manager did a little damage control and upgraded my drink from the regular size to the large size."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are fine yet over-priced. Always order their Aroma A.C.E. sandwiches, especially the sauce they put in there that works well with the avocado spread. 

Spacious and perhaps a perfect location to spend an afternoon on books or laptops. PROBLEM! There is just one tiny table that has power source to your laptop. YES ONE ONLY. They have the other two that were blocked as they interfere the cashier and one that is just ridiculously positioned near the self-served area for milk and stuff. And this is a cafe I supposed? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I like to get their lunch menu. Tasty sandwiches, all of them. Soup of the day can vary and sometimes it is tasty sometimes so so. My fav is Red pepper Gouda, yummy!"}
{"text":"I really don't like the open space concept, they really need walls of some sort. Can't get studying done when people are walking by or even have a conversation with a buddy. 

I got the muffin and asked them to heat it up. They did and burnt it. Was not impressed.

I also got a drink, which was okay and standard. Which is why I'm giving them at least a 2 star."}
{"text":"I really like the outdoor seating set up here. Good place to go to for a quick and healthy meal. Their customer service is pretty good and they have plenty of options for vegetarian meals. 

I ordered the grilled chicken salad which came with balsamic vinaigrette and grilled egg plant. $8.99. Very quick service. 

Love how they have lemon water dispenser for you as well."}
{"text":"My 1st drink was an affogato, my 2nd was their pistachio latte. Both yum. Even their hot chocolate was delicious."}
{"text":"yes. yes and..yes.
excellent place, free wifi, awesome coffee, yummy foods, free bit of chocolate with every purchase which is a lovely surprise EVERY time I go even though I know they do it.  
FABulous large patio outside.  will call your order so you dont' have to sit around awkwardly at the bar waiting.
staff super firendly and nice.
number one spot on the corner- only probelm is it gets packed pretty quickly and you feel bad loitering withyour laptop when there are so many customers.  If you really intend on loitering/studying alone go diagonal to the second cup.  Just because this place is so popular and it's not masschain like starbucks and second cup so you kind of want to give them as much customer turnoever as possible to keep them in business."}
{"text":"They're so friendly here! Really kind staff have won me over. I love their Turkish coffee and their iced coffee. Love that they carry vegan brownies (!!!) Wish they had some better options on their menu, though."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised how much I liked this place.  Walking past this, and the Bloor st location, it always seemed too much like a fast food joint.  The plastic chairs, and the guy calling out your orders.

That being said, it doesn't really have that vibe once you've ordered, and you have your coffee and food, and you can relax.  The quality of the food is really high.  Its as much a food spot as a coffee spot.  Everything that everyone around me was eating looked delicious, as was my croissant and latte. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, almost none of the outlets work and its loud and kinda filthy....
But I really like it. 
I like the staff, although it seems there's a high turnover rate because I never recognize them except the manager. 
They're quite friendly, though. 
The breakfast salad thing is bad but I love the tea, etc. and the fact that the hot drinks all come with a chocolate totally totally makes it awesome. Even the little water cooler is cute. 
The patio, when the weather is nice, is loooooooovely.
And at the end of the day, no matter what, despite the lack of outlets, space and cleanliness, this place is still vastly superior to the two alternatives on the corner: Starbucks and Second Cup. 

My vote will always go to Aroma."}
{"text":"It is my first time here, ordered Philly steak sandwiches and mango kale.

I don't like the sandwiches. The cheese was not spread out evenly, and insipid in taste. However, i like the bread warmand soft! 

Mango kale is good as always."}
{"text":"Got a simple matcha latte with almond milk in this Aroma with a very nice exterior design. Delicious and I loved how the barista added a cute touch (latte art) to it. Nice service, fast wifi, and great experience!"}
{"text":"Went in for some breakfast and did not enjoy the food or experience. The service was below par and the food was just edible.

I came in and ordered the breakfast sandwich which was very dry and bland. The person taking my order was distracted talking to a who I am assuming is a friend. I don't understand why some people think that this is acceptable, especially at a food service industry.

The coffee was okay and I still don't understand the little chocolate, it's like a mint you get at a hotel for coffee. I guess I'm not much of chocolate bar kind of person. Their seating area is uncomfortable and cramped, even through we were the only ones sitting in the area. I think that the seats itself mostly made it feel awkward.

I find that all the aroma has the same feel to them and I really haven't been impressed by them since. I probably won't ever come back unless the city runs out of coffee. If you're looking for good coffee, a Balzac is just down the street by Earth."}
{"text":"Woohoo!   I'm surrounded by as many Aroma Espresso Bars as I am with Starbucks.  This location is brand spanking new and is located a few steps away from Starbucks at the MaRS building.  I've always personally been a bigger fan of Aroma as they have the better tasting espresso, lattes and sandwiches.  Plus they always offer a small piece of chocolate with your drink.  Darn you little chocolates!, You've suckered me into switching over to the dark side."}
{"text":"Love how close this location is to my work.  This Aroma Espresso Bar is located inside of Mount Sinai Hospital's new RioCan Foodhall.  There are other fast food chains like Thai Express, Me-Va-Me, a sushi place, burrito place and a pizza place.

I come here every morning to grab a Matcha Green Tea Latte.  It's the perfect blend of matcha, sweetness and foamy milk.  It pairs nicely with the Aroma A.C.E. which is a grilled chicken breast, slathered with creamy housemade avocado spread, an egg over easy, arugula, and some of their aroma sauce (not sure what it is).  It can be a bit pricy after ordering a drink and half a sandwich, but you are paying for quality drinks and decent sandwiches.  You also gotta love the little milk chocolate that accompany each beverage.

Tip: If you're a hospital staff member, they'll offer 10% off your order."}
{"text":"Omg I have been drinking way too much Starbucks because it's so close to work... Having the latte here right now, wow holy what a great tasting latte! I will definitely seek out this chain over Starbucks!"}
{"text":"The service is great, they have that know-what-we're-doing franchise feel. I can't imagine how it's making money as there's sooooo much staff. Nice place to sit and relax. Food is awesome and some selections are very healthy. Price is fine. And it's kosher! And they custom your order, I made one of their custom sandwiches from 2 other sandwich ingredients, was awesome! I highly recommence a buereka treat or a croissant omelette sandwich, yum! There's free wifi but only one plug outlet for people to use which is annoying but as long as I get that one seat I'm fine! Outside is really nice to sit during the summer, too."}
{"text":"Nice location, good coffee and excellent breakfast!
I had a nice cappuccino with a breakfast sandwich. The sandwich was freshly made with eggs, tomatoes and lettuce. Great experience, I will go back again."}
{"text":"I don't understand other reviews I think people are just too demanding, it's a coffee place and is not expensive. 

I understand if they were in New York going to a 5 star Michelin-rated restaurant and you were paying $700 for lunch, then the service should be impeccable but here they are selling coffee. 

You come in, you order coffee and pastries-I love the Alfajor- and get your coffee, sit in the nice ambiance, drink it and get out.

As easy as that. The people here are friendly and I've been several times, of course they don't throw themselves on their knees when you come in, but they get the job done, they don't work for millions of dollars, so let's give them a bit of a slack!"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely ridiculous and will NOT be returning anytime soon. I had my two little cousins with me and we waited for over 20 minutes for ONE DRINK (lemon ice mint). When we asked where our drink was very nicely, the woman made a nasty face and said it's on its way when it clearly was not because it was only after this that I could see the people in the kitchen start to make it. When my drink arrived, this lady did not even apologize but just sort of pushed the drink towards me. I was horrified and there is absolutely no way that I will be returning here."}
{"text":"This location is always packed, weekdays, weekends, it doesn't matter. It could use more seating but the real issue is the fact that entire tables are often occupied by a single student who may stay for any duration: it could be thirty minutes, it could be eight hours.

Like any Aroma however, the food and coffee is excellent. It's just unfortunate: Aroma isn't Starbucks. It serves actual meals--full breakfasts and lunches. And you have one student taking up a booth when they have the largest urban campus in a thousand kilometers. Zero consideration, but what more would you expect from a barely post-pubescent minds with partially developed senses of self-identity.

Also frustrating: compared to other Aroma's this location is poorly bussed, there is only one trash receptacle and its opening is designed to fit items no larger than a coffee cup and the weekend staff is unfriendly. But the weekday staff is pretty helpful and efficient.

I've visited this location between 50 and 100 times since it opened two years ago and those have been my observations. It's a little more manageable in the summer though, since they do have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This place is basically working very hard to look like a quality specialty coffee shop, while selling mediocre coffee. Their frozen drinks are expensive and crappy. Simply not a wonderful shop other than that it looks very nice and you get a free chocolate with some drinks. I want good coffee, not good looks."}
{"text":"No wifi and no walk plug at all in a coffee shop. This is ridiculous. The customer service is friendly thou."}
{"text":"Very very good salads and hot drinks selection. Nice ambience. However, they are very slow with taking the orders and serving the food/drinks."}
{"text":"It is a canteen, few salads and coffee, very surprised to see a positive feedback from people."}
{"text":"Tried the cappuccino here and it was pretty good. I also got the Alfajores. It had no flavor whatsoever and I felt like I was eating paper with dulce in the middle lol."}
{"text":"I love the Aroma Coffee!!! The espresso, chocolate chunks, and the home made whipped cream .... oh my sooooo yummy!. Sooo good. It was pure deliciousness in a cup. No lie."}
{"text":"The Annex is no stranger to coffee shops and cafes as this Aroma location is surrounded by competitors: across the road from it is Second Cup, right next to it on the same side of the street is Starbucks and down the road is the Green Beanry. While I'd had coffee at the said competitors, I must say Aroma stands out the most, although it may not be the best place for an exam cram session.

Unlike it's competitors, right upon entry, Aroma already has a different vibe to it than its competitors, which is probably why it's not a great for studying. It has an edgy, retro yet modern feel, thanks to its red and black interior color scheme, tasteful furnishing with a coolness appeal, and upbeat music at a tolerable volume. In addition to the red and black, the graphics on the walls give the place an artsy fartsy touch... which isn't bad in this case! 

In terms of seating, it has alot of seats at the front of the store and the back. The seating area closer to the front is brighter than the area in the back though. The back seating area is dim, so not a good place to read, but definitely a good place to chat with friends because it was definitely louder with more groups than singletons.  Aroma also features a patio with red patio chairs, but it was raining today, so no one was out there. We just got rid of snow in Toronto, so the patio also wasn't fully set up. 

Aroma features a full menu fixed high on the wall behind the cashier/ coffee bar. Unlike its competitors, it also has a full kitchen where REAL food items are freshly prepared... mostly sandwiches and salads, that type of stuff. The coffee drip is also reasonably priced, more or less similiar to the beverage sizes and prices you will find at Starbucks and Second Cup for a regular drip coffee. (Which is very smart on the business side, levels the playing field). The coffee also comes with a small piece of individually wrapped chocolate with the cafe's name on it. (I saved the chocolate and plan to give it to a family member or co-worker, whoever I see first and if I remember. I'm vegan and can't have the chocolate. The only reason I know that it's milk chocolate is because I asked a girl at the neighbouring table

Overall, although I tried really hard to study and didn't get much done, I still enjoyed my Aroma experience. What I found really cool was that they have a transparent water dispensing machine filled with lemon slices -anyone can help themselves to a cup of water. This cafe is very cute, has a good atmosphere and something different from the typical coffee franchises. The price of coffee is reasonable and priced strategically: for more or less the same price that you will find at Starbucks, why not try a smaller, different and good looking coffee franchise next door? Also, you can get real good that isn't pre-made and shipped from some factory far away. Although I wouldn't come back to study, I wouldn't mind coming back for a date with friends or a cute guy, or to read something that isn't a textbook. 

*Hint, hint. Nudge nudge* to guys: Bring your sweetheart here! It's trendy, it's different, it has food, it plays good music, and you won't feel as lame or boring as if you were to say: \"Let's go for *insert name of typical/ common coffee franchise*.\" You might score points for trying... like trying to be original/ different. Effort counts, it really does!"}
{"text":"Yay for a new location here in the 'Bridge.

We only had coffee (Canadiano, new one to me - Americano with milk; and a good old brewed with added flavour shot). Aroma locations are remarkably consistent with their product offerings in terms of taste and quality, if not always with the physical set-up of the restaurants and accompaniments. This one is nicely done, although it would have been awesome to have some booths like they do at Yonge and Eglinton. Here it's just small tables, and one row of bench seats with small tables, but it has decent capacity. It was also clean and properly equipped with full supply of all the incidentals (full range of sweeteners, creamers, napkins, etc. etc.) so you don't have to go back and chase staff for them. Kudos to the staff for maintenance.

The staff who took our order was super nice, friendly, and obviously wanted to make sure we were well served. There were some glitches with one coffee being served as takeaway in a paper cup in spite of clearly being ordered as stay-in, and a wait long enough for the Canadiano to be done after subsequent customers got their coffees, so I can't say it was a 5 star service experience, but it was close otherwise.

I'll gladly go back for the higher rate atmosphere and coffee (and that includes the signature piece of chocolate - mm mmm!) as a nice alternative to the glaring, fluorescent, plastic ambience of Tims and their inconsistent versions of coffee.

So glad to have a proper Aroma location right here in Woodbridge!"}
{"text":"Still the lowest GTA rung on the AE ladder.

No change since my initial review, except to say, no improvement since."}
{"text":"Went back down today for another salad and had informed them of yesterday's visit of my salad that didn't have the dressing.  Their response verbatim was \"well you should have checked\".  Wow, there is no need on my part to explain further."}
{"text":"I will not be revisiting this Aroma location again leaving quite upset last week with my second visit. 

We came on a Saturday morning with my family and my baby.  Ordered 4 iced coffees, 2 of which I requested to be decaf.  Got the 2 regular ones in about 7 minutes...then another 15 minutes went by they told me their machine was broken and couldn't make my decaf and cashier asked if I wanted something else instead.  I excused myself for a minute to walk back to my mom to see if there was anything else she could drink.  Then called me saying the machine was fixed and I was delighted.  Literally 20 minutes went by and the barista tells me that the machine was still broken. 

So they gave me a refund in cash although I paid with credit card, whatever because at this point I was so annoyed I didn't give too hoot about another thing.  

Another reason for 1 star was a man came in asking if they had garbage to be collected and the barista went back into their kitchen to collect the bag of garbage, tied the garbage bag and took it out to give it to the man and proceeded back to making drinks for customers without washing his hands.  This was pure disgust.  Goodbye to this Aroma location because I will never pay another visit."}
{"text":"Went into this venue after a workout at the LA fitness in the same shopping center. I was hungry and craving a good breakfast. I ordered the aroma all day power breakfast and must say I was a bit disappointed. Maybe its because I have been spoiled with such good cafes in southern california, not sure, but anyways. I would give this place a 3 star on food and 2 star on service. The lady who gave me the pastry i also ordered sneezed into her had and touched my pastry without washing her hand. She isn't reflective of the entire staff, I have been there a few times. But that last visit will be my last time, I was just disgusted."}
{"text":"My husband and I are on vacation stating across the street. We've been coming every morning for a breakfast coffee and hot chocolate. This is GREAT coffee and even better hot chocolate. Luke chunks of chocolate at the bottom that is continuously melting and making your drink even more chocolatey. Lol We love it and wish we could take this coffee shop home with us! Bonus: you get a mini piece of children with your order!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place to come and do some writing, have a coffee or just lounge. It's big and spacious but most definitely cozy. They have wi-fi and customer service here is impeccable. 

I got uphold by the combo idea. They offered me the slice of toast with friend eggs and a coffee. I told Adam (who seemed like the boss) that I would rather not. I like my coffee after my breakfast. He offered to allow me to come back for my coffee when I finished my meeting upstairs. Amazing!! I remember a woman talking about the TV and how it wasn't working or something (CP24 was playing the entire time with no sound so no idea what she was talking about). Adam reassured her that they would get it fixed. 

POTATO HASH (signature dish): I got my Potato Hash and the toast was seriously over-toasted to the point where I tried to cut up my friend egg with a fork and knife and the entire toast it was sitting on flipped over. I told Adam this when he asked me how it was. He told me the toaster machine wasn't working that well. The Potato Hash itself if put on top of the friend egg/toast tasted great. I've never had Potato Hash with sweet potato. Great presentation and decent taste. A woman next to me came up and randomly said how delicious my meal looked. They also gave me an Orange type of dressing which amplified the taste."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and delicious coffee. I ordered the matcha latte with a shot of espresso. SO GOOD. The employees here are very nice as well. Fast service as long as the people in line in front of you know what they're ordering before they get in line. There is lots of seating indoors and outdoors. They have a super extensive menu and even some drinks I had never even heard of!"}
{"text":"Very popular coffee shop in the Annex. Good place to hit up for a coffee or snack/meal pre or post studying.  I love their salads because they are filling and come with bread and butter. Mmmm bread and butter. Their mint tea is also a novelty too as it is brewed with fresh mint leaves. The squares of chocolate they give you with each drink are nice little treat too!

The decor is very un-starbucks with red and black hues all around-very modern and sophisticated. However, the seats fill up here very quickly on busy nights I've had to \"table watch\" a few nights here to snag a seat."}
{"text":"Great food. Good coffee but slowest and most disorganised service- always!
Not only do the customers often look confused as to what the ordering process is (where the line is) but the staff are often just standing around with the majority looking even more confused and overwhelmed than the customers (picture a deer in headlights).
I still come here daily because it's the closest coffee shop to my work, but I seriously can't understand why they can't hire someone who can manage this place decently."}
{"text":"Great tasting lattes, the complementary chocolate is good too. A little bit pricey though but flavour-wise, better than your average coffee shop fare."}
{"text":"Food at this location is not as consistent as other aroma locations. 

Owner isn't friendly. 

I always opt for cleaner food such as salads and the odd sandwich. 

Definitely a healthier option for \"fast food\" than so many other places."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years but after my last experience -- never again. My partner and I ordered teas -- not a difficult order to get right -- and the water they put the tea bags in was not even close to boiling. The tea bags just floated around, the water remained crystal clear; it was tepid and you could drink it right away. We told them the water wasn't boiling and they said it was, and then they corrected themselves and said \"it's as hot as they can get it\" and that's \"how it always is.\" Well, it's not hot enough to make tea with and it sucks to pay $3 for some tepid water. They didn't seem the least bit concerned or offer to give us our money back. Someone suggested they could put our mugs in the microwave -- they did and it didn't help to bring it to a boiling point. We gave up, took a few more sips of our tepid water-with-a-tea-bag-floating-inside-of-it, and left."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed every occasion when I've been here and the other locations as well. If you want the feeling of being in Europe this is the place to be"}
{"text":"Aroma is my go to meeting place for coffee and tea and has a good sized patio to make use of during the good weather.

In particular I love the iced lemon mint. The fresh mint and the ice are the perfect thing on a hot day."}
{"text":"Was recommended by another fellow yelper to try out this place and it was a great choice. Came here on a busy Friday afternoon for lunch and ordered their sandwich and salad combo. For the price of $10, it was well worth it because the portions were generous and the food was delicious. I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and a quinoa salad; both were light and delicious. You can also choose from different lunch combos such as soup and salad. Great selection and great value compared to your usual $10 lunches. I'll definitely come back here to try their other menu items and their coffees!"}
{"text":"The lattes here are spot on. It's very crowded every time we go but they always get the order right and we always happen to find a seat without much loitering around awkwardly. The chocolate on the side of each beverage is a nice touch. The baked goods don't stack up equally to the lattes but they are still good if you are hungry and need a snack.

Have gone frequently since discovering it."}
{"text":"A message I sent to their 'feedback' email address on November 1st. Still haven't heard back from them! Don't understand why I didn't  receive a 'thank you, we'll take this back' or anything...my feedback is pretty consistent with some of the others (Olivia, Tiff etc.)

------
Hi there,

I don't usually write these kind of things but since I am such a big fan of aroma, I felt like I was obligated to say something because I have always been a happy customer. I understand that Saturdays are really busy, but it may not be the best day to train new employees. Or a day to pass frustration on to customers.

This is exactly what happened about 30 minutes ago. I just got home from your King West location. It was exceptionally busy as you would expect of a Saturday morning. The young gentleman that took my order was obviously the new employee. With a more experienced employee standing by his side. He politely took my order while his colleague helped him along. I walked over to the bar and waited for my order. Two americanos were placed on the bar and my name was called. \"Hi, I ordered a double americano, not two americanos\". The frustrated barista got my order again, and issued me a refund for the double americano. I didn't mind the mistake and didn't even expect the refund but it was a nice gesture. I continued to wait for my sandwich. A brown bag is placed on the bar and my name is called again. I grab the bag and go over to the dairy station. I check the bag and only a half sandwich is in the bag when I ordered the full sandwich. I walked back up to the bar and waited to point out the mistake. Another young lady looked at me and said the ticket only said half.  As in she wanted me to explain the mistake somehow. There is no winning in this situation without looking like Kate Gosselin with one hand on her hip,  finger wagging in the air. I looked at how stretched the staff was and calculated how long it would probably take for them to turn my sandwich around again. Forgot to mention that I'm still wearing my costume from last night so I look like a tool. I said forget it just walked out in defeat.

I'm sorry for such a long winded email. But I'm essentially sitting here at home with half the sandwich I had mentally committed to eating and paid for. Please also before judging the length of this email keep in mind I didn't do this on Yelp I actually wrote an email!

That's how much I care about you guys.

I hope things get better, I hope I didn't get anyone in trouble , but just hope when I check in again in a couple of weeks or maybe longer, that someone over there got my email , doesn't take offense, and makes some positive change.

See you soon, 
Anthony"}
{"text":"Long story short, I was charged twice on my debit card yesterday. I told the guy who did the transactions, he didn't know what to do and told me he can't issue me a refund after I asked him. I'm like of course you can, anyway he asked his other coworker what to do they didn't know either. Anyway, I ended up getting a refund after they called their manager on the phone..like seriously? Something that can be so easily be resolved took longer than expected. Their customer service sucks tbh so I don't think I will return to this location ever."}
{"text":"I don't come here often, mostly because the staff are rude and mean looking. I'd rather spend an extra 50 cents and walk up two blocks to De Mello coffee and get normal service. Also, there's a really funky, horrible smell near the washrooms. It smells like a sewer and matches the staffs' attitude: poo."}
{"text":"I was in Fairview Mall with my friends when we decided to sit down here for a while. I ordered black coffee. The mug (or should I say the bowl) was huuuge (picture below, Splenda for scale).

Hey I'm not complaining, I like coffee. Seating is alright for a coffeeshop at a mall, but I have seen better. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"I love Aroma in general and I feel sad to have to write this review.  I work near this Aroma and come here a few times a week.  The service at this location is generally quite cold and unfriendly compared to other locations.  However, this has never prompted me to write a negative review.  I always order a drip coffee and pour in soy milk.  Yesterday, upon placing my usual order, the person taking my order (who recognizes me and knows I will ask for soy milk) advised that they will now be charging for soy milk.  As someone who doesn't eat dairy, I am very accustomed to paying the additional charge for soy milk when ordering a latte, misto, etc. but to pour in a splash to my drip coffee ... no other coffee shop is this stingy.  The medium drip coffee with the additional $0.80 charge for soy milk was going to be $3.60 ... at that price might as well order a fancy drink (i.e. latte, misto, etc.).  Completely out of principle, I left and got a delicious coffee at Panera Bread.  If Aroma doesn't change this policy, they will lose me as a regular customer.  Their loss."}
{"text":"This place only recently opened but it gets really busy. It's also pretty small so the tables fill up very fast. Regardless, you should dine in because the store is really nice and has good vibes. Menus are hard to read (maybe because I need new glasses) so they have a few mini menus in front of the cash register. The staff was nice but service could have been faster.
I got a medium Iced Chai Latte ($4.65) good but very light chai flavour. I wish the taste was a little stronger because all the ice diluted the taste even more. 
The Shakshuka ($9.95) was pretty good. It's two eggs in a warm red pepper and tomato sauce served with tahini and bread. It was tasty and very aromatic. I loved that the egg yolks were still runny because last time I got it at a different location, the yolks were fully cooked. They also gave more bread than I needed. 
Although I had a good experience, my friends did complain about the sandwiches being very small so keep that in mind when ordering them."}
{"text":"This place has dirty tables, dirty windows, and absolutely filthy washrooms.  Need I say more.  Never again."}
{"text":"It's a great place for business meetings and for hosting interviews at but it's a little too pricey for what you actually get in my opinion. The basic coffee that you can get is pretty standard but I wouldn't go for the food."}
{"text":"This Aroma is the first one of its kind in Toronto, the initial outpost of an Israeli chain that has since taken off. Great ambiance, wonderful sweets and sandwiches, nice service, and--of course--excellent coffee. I keep making converts.

The one problem is that they don't have enough power plugs for laptops and their WiFi is wonky. Yes, I know that having people in for hours on end nursing a single cup of coffee just fills up seats, but ..."}
{"text":"It's great and better than Starbucks LOL, YES I said it.  I love Starbucks too, but Aroma's lattes are creamier and they put little designs like hearts on top of your latte.  I also love that they give you a little wrapped chocolate."}
{"text":"Great location! One of my favorite spots in North York to have coffee or some food. Healthy food options are great! Sometimes it can get very busy but it's worth it. Friendly staff and great coffee."}
{"text":"I have been to so many cafes and espresso bars that I lost count. I've had cafe ole in Buenos Aires, and Espresso Macchiatto in South Beach, Florida. Let's just say, if I could, I'd hook coffee up in IV form.

But enough about me, let's talk AROMA!
I've visited their promenade mall location the very first time. I thought the decor and color scheme was enticingly chic and welcoming. I noticed they sold ALFAJORES (if you have no idea what these babies are, do yourself a HUGE favor and google). I asked the barista if this was a south american company and why they offered such a rare-find sweet and she explained that the owners are Israeli and that Argentinian food is quite popular in Israel.(You learn something new every day).

I just had to buy them to enjoy with my coffee and it was incredible! Very similar to how I make them at home (that's right Yelpville, I can cook too)
I was over the moon when I realized that Vaughan Mills was going to have the privilege of an AROMA location.
No offense to Vaughan Mills fans but the mall is horrible. We'll leave that for another review.

Aroma in Vaughan Mills also offers alfajores: but a blind person could put them together better than these guys. (No offense to the blind, but these things were awful) I thought, they look bad, but do they taste bad?...almost $5 later and YUP, they tasted bad too....so dry. I really do hope people don't buy them thinking thats what they ought to taste like. 

Everything else is nothing short of excellent!
Espresso is fresh and well put together. They know how to make it all...and if you haven't already...you must TRY THE LONDON FOG!! Best. Tea. Ever.
It's not a tea, its an experience....: earl grey with vanilla and steamed milk. Mmm!

Complimentary iced lemon water and a delectable chocolate with every drink.

Excellence just draws me in to places like this....tell me what you thought!?

ALSO- I'm sorry I only posted pics of my one drink with this review, but I did try more things:
I've had various coffees, cookies, etc....

I highly recommend:
The chocolate brownie (its chocolate and its a brownie) 
The cinnamon raisin roll- it was AMAZING!
The croissant- cheese and butter- the french get it right every time!
The hot chocolate deluxe with whipped cream"}
{"text":"The aroma at Aroma is wondrous. It's such a comfortable and casual place to have your afternoon fix. This location is big and the layout is spacious. I enjoy sitting at the bar, it makes me feel like I'm important somehow. 

The drinks here are good. They make great lattes and cappuccinos. In the summer I had their lemonade with fresh torn mint leaves, it was certainly refreshing and much needed under the weather.

I heard their hot chocolate is really good too. I've seen them prepare it while sitting at the bar. They fit big pieces of chocolate in a cup and pour hot steamy milk right on top. It looks amazzzzzzing (with 6 z's).

Not to mention that you get a small piece of chocolate with every cup of steamy whatever-you-order.

Overall, Aroma is a great place to meet and catch up with friends. It's a casual but sometimes crowded environment. Large windows let you people watch and the patio let's you enjoy the breeze whenever possible.One thing that I almost forgot, there is a fireplace in the back too! So it's great in the winter."}
{"text":"Aroma has always satisfied my love for cafés. It does a good job making me feel like its not a franchise. This particular location, being brand new, is not only slightly more chic, its also more spacious. Given that there are plenty of other coffee shops around, it does a good job standing out with its menu, size, and patio.

The coffees are good, the food tastes freshly made and you always get a free price of chocolate with every drink. Can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"Aroma! Why is going on? It was love at first sight when I started hanging out at the bloor location. Fresh croissants, beautiful espressos with that dark chocolate for my piping hot beverage... Then came those wonderful sandwiches... Tuna being my personal fav...

Sadly however, with great expansion comes a great price... And quality suffers. My recent visit to the King and Charlotte location pained me greatly. I ordered my tuna sandwich only to find it full of sand. It shouldn't be crunchy. Not to mention the sandwich was lopsided with the mayo and pickles on only one side of the sandwich. I had my usual red lentil soup and it tasted like chalk. I was so disappointed... My espresso was still wonderful as was my cookie but the rest of the meal was a downer.

Aroma... Stop trying to just make money. For patrons like myself that come to expect a certain type of quality synonymous to your brand, don't disappoint us... Don't skimp out on training for your staff. It's sad when a meal leaves a bitter taste in my mouth... Literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"Awesome place.
I had been a regular customer at Starbucks across the street, but there were no seats there, so we decided to try Aroma.
I had the Aroma Coffee, and she had the hot chocolate.
Wow both were good, the hot chocolate had a bunch of real chocolate in it, it was delicious.
The Aroma Coffee (we weren't sure which was which) was great too, much more than a regular coffee (mmm whipped cream) 
We had some sort of cookies with our order too (shortbread, with a dulce deleche centre (they were great too)
You pay a bit more, but everything is so worth it.
Looking forward to trying the food next time, hopefully it wont be as crowded."}
{"text":"Fantastic - Real espresso just steps away for me. How wonderful for me and for you. Newly built and looks terrific. 

Lots of seating and a full menu of coffee, tea, espresso and lots of food items, sandwiches, pastries, juices, smoothies....the list goes on."}
{"text":"Absolutely bustling on Sunday afternoon. Cute place, yummy drinks, and nice staff. Surprised to see people with laptops working here since it was so noisy but I can imagine it's not too bad a study spot on quieter days. Food is healthy and Middle Eastern inspired."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place, I just find it overpriced.  Had a nice cheese roll, which they warmed up and a small coffee and it came to $5.30.  That's way too expensive for a \"light\" breakfast. I can get a banana loaf and a much larger coffee at Starbucks for $4.60 or so and I really don't like Starbucks all that much so when I am paying them a compliment, then something must be wrong.  

I've seen the prices for the breakfasts and their sandwiches and a 1/2 sandwich is like $5 to $6, while a full sandwich is $8 to $10 (power breakfast is 9.95) and that's way too much for a chain coffee shop.  

However, the coffee did taste good and they have nice couches and HAD a nice patio (currently under renovation), but it's still expensive.  I only went here because I was too lazy to walk out of the building to go to Tim's, Starbucks or McDonalds in the morning.  The only real bright side is that it's connected to the subway."}
{"text":"So I found this place while walking around to look for food. And then I checked Ritual where I can easily locate Aroma to place orders. So I ordered special coffee, Brazilian Hazelnut Latte. This tasted very good, I can taste the hazelnut as well as smell the aroma of the hazelnut. Not bad! Only thing I can comment is the location is wee bit dark? But it's clean. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Came here to meet with a friend over coffee. I have never been to Aroma, so this is a first visit. I grabbed a table and waited for my coffee to be made. They are quite efficient when there isn't a huge line up. 

The venue is quite clean and very well lit, even on a gloomy day like Saturday. There are a lot of customers coming and going at this place. But one recommendation to other patrons: get here fast and grab a table, these are commodities. Back to the review. This location isn't like how some other coffee shops. There aren't any students studying on a Saturday where they are holding up a table. The patrons that come to this location tends to be families. This gives a good vibe of the family oriented setting. I like it. 

On to the coffee I got. As this is my first time at Aroma. I don't know what I should get. So I gotten myself a Cortado. Taste is not bad at all, I like strong coffee in general. And what's more interesting is Aroma provides a piece of chocolate on the side. Though I kindly donate that to my friend. She enjoyed it far more than I will. Cause I prefer the taste of coffee and not deadened by other flavours. 

For a first visit, I like the experience I had. Will come visit again."}
{"text":"Went here twice while I was in Downtown Toronto. The first time, I acquired a plain latte. The latte was pretty standard fare, nothing fancy but pretty tasty nonetheless. The second time I went, I was feeling like something a bit more sweet, and got the Aroma Coffee - a mix of espresso, milk, solid chocolate, and whipped cream. It was pretty much exactly what I was after. The best part about this place (for me) is probably the little chocolate that they give you with your coffee purchase. 

The cafe was nice and clean, and the service was incredibly fast and friendly. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The espresso and mixed drinks are great. I have not tried any of the food items so cannot judge them.

Ambience is great. There are lots of places to sit. It is modern, yet cozy and clean. The service is great too. When I was here the girls working there were really pretty. It made me want to join the team an be an Aroma girl too!"}
{"text":"Park by the Go For Tea! 

Fairly clean and organized - especially compared to the location at Rutherford. Lots of comfortable seating! 

There are outlets under the window seating. 

Wifi is espresso - fairly quick, no complaints. 

No complaints!"}
{"text":"Arindam is one of the best reasons to come to this place. Always a smile on his face. Plus he remembered us from MONTHS ago. (My friend is quite memorable though, maybe that had something to do with it).  The mochas they make here far surpass anything I have come to know and love in the States. It's super gooey chocolatey on the bottom and you have to stir it, and they remind you to do this, otherwise you won't be able to experience the optimum amount of chocolate pleasure your taste buds could ever try to handle. They always include a little wrapped piece of chocolate along with. I am poor so I don't get to stay at ritzy hotels with mints on my pillow but at least I have a piece of chocolate along with my mocha at Aroma to make up for it. It's decadently delightful. I am addicted to their egg salad sandwich. It is so ridiculously yummy with the perfect ratio of egg & bread. I'm going to need an intervention, I am very addicted to this spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! finally, I have a nice place to stop by for a healthy and GLUTEN FREE lunch, snack or  any meal. When I'm AT  the mall, or even in the area.  I really enjoy their lattes, London fog, Cappoccino, smoothies, cold drinks and their amazing little chocolate treats! And I like that they offer complimentary lemon water! 
But am disappointed u cannot purchase those chocolates. (I've tried) and recommended they offer them for sale! Since they won't really give you any extra..

I would not call this a restaurant, more like a 'self serve cafe', the place is generally very busy, but I manage to come inn during down times. At times the service can be a little slow (when busy), although it is mostly serve yourself. And some of the staff could be a little friendlier... 

How it works; You make your order and pay,  Grab a seat. Wait for your name to be called, pick up your order - enjoy! and once your done with your meal (if your sitting inn) you leave it on the table and your free to go... I personally don't mind it at all, simple- straight forward. No tips,  Or waiting for the bill... Only downfall is when their busy they don't clean up all the tables which need attention and you might be stuck with someone else's trash 

But, generally it's maintained and clean, including the washrooms.

The food is always fresh! good quality, I never get any allergic reaction, or sensitivity. And it always tastes great! 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place for a while now and have a couple of observations to make: the staff are very nice, the owner on the other hand, not so much. He is rather unfriendly and never says hello....even if he sees you a lot. 

The other major complaint I have, is that they allow CIGAR SMOKING on their patio. I was there the other day and one man cleared the entire patio with the stench of his cigar. It's 2014, everyone knows second hand smoke causes cancer, to say nothing of the horrible smell of smoke....it seems crazy to me that they haven't caught up with the times. Customers were leaving because of this. 

Having said that, the coffee is pretty good, and the baked goods are very good.(MUCH better than Starbucks) This is why they are getting 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's about time they opened an aroma in this part of the city! It's just what was needed down here.

I came by for the first time a few days ago,  and everything was up to the standards that an aroma franchise in my mind is expected to meet. I got a sandwich and salad (only $10.45 for the combo) and was so full by tye end of my meal! I even made some substitutions to my order which I know, can sometimes get screwed up, but they made my order perfectly! :D 

After eating I decided to order a drink....their ice lemon mint, it's the perfect drink for summer! Nice and refreshing! 

I really like the layout of this location too, it's long, and actually has two entrances; one from the street,  and one that connects to the RBC WaterPark Place building that's just above the cafe. During lunch here on a week day, due to thw fact that there's a major business building right on top of the place,  it can get quite crowded, so keep that in mind.

They have a great variety of seating throughout the cafe, and many seats are located near outlets in case you need to charge your laptop/phone or something. They also have free wifi, so it makes for the perfect place to come and study!

The staff here was also great, sometimes for me that can be the turning point of whether or not I like a place. All the employees were smiling, helpful,  and a pleasure to make chit chat with!

Please do yourself a favour,  stop by this place, and treat yourself to a handcrafted Espresso drink and a delicious sandwich haha!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Can't really ask for anything better when it comes to dining in a cafe environment. Food and pastries are amazing and very fresh. I would recommend the double up combo, chose 2 from either a soup, salad, or half sandwich for $10.....it's a great deal! The drinks they offer here are far better than anything you could get at Starbucks or Second Cup: Quality beans, and hand crafted to perfection! :')
Staff working here was really friendly, and made me feel noticed as soon as I walked in, which means a lot. The store layout is very pleasing with a variety of different chairs and table styles to sit at. Personally, I prefer sitting on a stool by the window....nothing like enjoying a hot drink and looking out at the awesome street view.
It's a great location, and would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I had a lentil soup. The guy server who looks a lot like a certain Suits character is sooo nice. 10/10"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that is happening in Richmond Hill/ Vaughn/ Thornhill then this is the place to be. It is more than just a standard coffee shop; it is a social scene. Locals gather to occupy the patio at the moment that the weather calls for it. Otherwise, the comfortably spacious interior can get pretty packed where individuals talk boisterously where it can get a tad noisy. Students, parents, young and old come to this little spot to hang out, read, or study. In consideration that there is a gym in the plaza, many come here for their healthy food options which lists from various salads, sandwiches and soups. Additionally, portions are generous and food products are fresh. The coffee here is recognized and praised for by many. This is because there is a great variety and at ones discretion it can be customized. The staff is very friendly and makes an effort to get to know regulars and welcome newcomers by answering any questions or providing recommendations. 

The modern interior is furnished with a couple of couched booths and couched at the borders. Otherwise, there are plenty of comfortable chairs and tables. Similarly, the patio is also filled with plenty of chairs and tables which are big enough to hold a full meal or two.  The only concern that should be emulated is for those who come work on their laptops; come with your battery full charged because the plugs are limited.

Try the Alfajores ! For those with a sweet tooth and open something out of the ordinary. It is a little cookie/chocolate sandwich that crumbles smoothly with every bite. It is just the right blend of sweet and savory. Accompanied by your coffee to your liking and you have a perfect coffee break in the waiting."}
{"text":"great service.  staff seemed really pleasent.  it took a lil bit for the food to come out and it was okay..not great..
 and seating area is a tad small inside but all in all a good experience.  theres a outdoor patio and a huge brick wall... its funny my bf and i were walking by and i work in advertising and i thought to myself... what a shame that they are not utilizing that space lol my bf lives nearby and u can hardly even tell its an aroma cafe lol it lacks a bit of presence lol"}
{"text":"extremely slow service.
doesnt matter what day or time or day of the week i come the food always takes at least 10-15min wait. for heavens sake its just salads.

the staff is nice and kind and its not the taking of the order tgat is time consuming but at the end of the day the efficiency lacks in the kitchen in getting the food out."}
{"text":"Even though everything is overpriced lol, the food is still good especially their salads and drinks mmmhmmm. Try not to go here at rush hour, the line and wait will piss you off"}
{"text":"Good place for a sandwich and a coffee along this stretch of Bloor.

Aroma's at coffee corners - an intersection with coffee shops on 3 of the four corners, and it's definitely the best of the bunch. Their coffee is well executed (I'm a sucker for Latte art, but it's quite drinkable even after you've ruined their pretty pictures) and their sandwiches are flavourful and fresh.

The place is deceptively large, but terribly organized - cramped near the bar where everyone waits for their orders, a small seating area up front, but then a rear seating area that is actually pretty roomy. Grabbed the table by the back once when a friend was at her wits' end - coffee and sandwiches brought her back around, I just had to sit still and let them do the work.

Quick recos: the avocado sandwich is tasty for veggie types, and their tuna's pretty decent as well. I've never had great luck with their meatier sandwiches but if you're jonesing for protein, hit up the Halumi. Always a good time.

Pro-tip: I know you want the multi-grain hippie bread for your sandwich, but I find the crust on their multi-grain *really* hard - unpleasant for a sandwich. Stick to whole wheat or even (gasp) white.

Extremely pro-tip: try the alfajores. Dunno how authentic they are, but they are delightful, and nowhere near as sweet as you're worried they'll be. Buy one for your date."}
{"text":"My review is low because of the owner Yanni or what everyone calls him- Johnny. He has a beard and a ponytail. I can't believe that he shows his face to the customers. His attitude is very poor and extremely rude.

I use to go in every morning to grab a coffee and meal. It's not a cheap place either! You would think the owner would greet his loyal customers in friendly way. Nope. Not a chance here.

The previous owner Neive (not sure if this is spelled right) was amazing. He left because he couldn't stand Johnny.

The girls are super friendly and the food is tasty. I would suggest that they put ponytail in the back so that his terrible attitude doesn't affect anymore customers.

I will not be coming back to invest in this company. He doesn't deserve my money."}
{"text":"I much PREFER this location over the Promenade Mall as this Aroma Espresso Bar is setup within Rutherford Marketplace Plaza and it actually has a REAL Outdoor Patio.  It even has an LCD to watch World Cup.

This would be a GREAT place to read a book or do some homework if not for the Grocery Store nearby that from time to time brings in a LOUD family of 8+ to ruin the calm coffee shopping atmosphere.

The staff are good and the person in-charge is very noticeable as he stands GUARD in his corner counter spot with his bluetooth headset and Apple laptop doing his thing with a serious facial tone.

The SEATING is very comfy and there are even booths for larger groups.  I ordered an Ice Americano and the friendly cashier asked for my name as per service not because she was hitting on me.  Most staff just like any other franchise Cafes are students doing there summer stint.

This area is still in CONSTRUCTION so the visual from the patio is not as pleasing as it can be.  There will be a Duff's coming soon here too so this location is definitely a PRIME spot to watch out for."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add a few things:

1. Big Ass pole in middle of shop blocking counter. (See Photo)
2. Iced Cap($4.00+) is pricey but good.
3. Hard plastic seats I haven't seen in my other spots.
4. NEW Iced Aroma Float(Iced Espresso + Ice Cream $5.00+)
5. Patio space."}
{"text":"I was on my way to pick up some grocery at T&T after work but I felt a bit on the tired side so i decided to go over to Aroma Espresso for a quick pick-me-up.  

I ordered a Medium Capuccino unlike last time when I usually order a Latte at any place. Also unlike the last time, the Cap was ready and my NAME was called out when I was just having a seat for a moment.

That was surprising for one thing my last experience, it took them around 10 minutes to get my Latte and secondly I had a couple customers that ordered ahead of me.  NO, I didn't complain about it but what I found WEIRD was that they served my Cappuccino in a coffee mug...  

Is it because they do not want to serve a Medium Cap in a Latte cup?  The Cap didn't TASTE any different but the SHOCK of it really made me felt an unexpected experience which kind of awoke me from my afternoon daze.

I was sitting in an INDOOR patio looking outside to the OTHER food court patrons at arms length!  Made me think outside the box and say patio's doesn't have to be outdoors to be a patio, RIGHT?  

All I was missing was a cool mid-summer nights breeze and I would have fallen asleep sipping my Cap and snoring my afternoon away.  I wonder if they can artificially do that in the middle of the mall/foodcourt?"}
{"text":"Have been frequenting this location for a couple of years. And as of late, it has become my 'go to' place when meeting up with a friend who lives in Thorncliffe. 

The coffee here is consistently good; I'm boring so I order a large brewed coffee to stay each time. It's not too light, but not too strong as well; I like their really big bowls that they use as well. I can't comment on the food, but it's your usual Aroma Espresso Bar items. My sister tells me that their sandwiches are pretty tasty and a friend swears by their salads. 

Anyway, there are a couple of perks to this location as opposed to their other shops. It's always clean here, including the washrooms and seating area. Service here is excellent; staff are really pleasant and ask me each time how my regular brewed coffee was. They're also super quick at clearing tables for the next customers or even clearing your mugs/plates at your table. There's a lot of seating here and it's never so crowded that you have to stand around and wait until a table opens. Another point is the parking (albeit not directly related to Aroma). There's a lot of parking and you're close to Longo's and the Beer Store so you can easily kill 2, 3 birds with one stone.

Good for: coffee, dates, hanging out with friend(s)"}
{"text":"I had the Mediterranean salad. It was delicious! The home dressing was the perfect touch to making it taste so refreshing. It was very filling and a great portion size. Try out the aroma chocolate cookie. It's like tiny hybrid of a cookie / doughnut, without being too sweet! I definitely crave the salad at times!  Great service. We called in a placed the order ahead of time so that we could pick it up ready dye to our limited lunch time. We got there and paid, and it was ready within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"This place deserves way more than the 1 1/2 stars it has.  Fortunately, I haven't received poor service like the previous reviewers, and so I can give an objective analysis/opinion on this place.

The layout of this place is pretty good.  It has a variety of different seating options - single booths, high tables, circular tables, single tables, etc.  I like the \"get-shit-done\" type of vibe from this cafe - it's not filled with plush sofas and wooden chairs like a traditional cafe.

The food/drinks are pretty good imo - I've had: Food - egg salad, philly cheesesteak sandwiches; Drinks - Coffee, Iced Chocolate, Earl Grey Tea.  They've all tasted pretty good, but are on the more expensive side - a full meal probably costs ~$11.00.

The service from my experience has been pretty good.  They often take your name and call you when your food/drink is ready.  They're all pretty friendly and service is good overall; no complaints.

I truly think that this place deserves moar stars.  They offer a variety of foods and drinks, the atmosphere is good for work, and the service is pretty standard.

Bonus: They give you a little chocolate whenever you order an item and they have a large dispenser filled with lemon water."}
{"text":"Best coffee chain. Awesome sandwiches with the best housemade bread. The chocolate croissants are also the best from any chain I have ever been to. If you are in Thornhill and need a coffee this is the place. The only issue is that it is often very busy as I am not the only person who loved this place. I downgraded from 4 stars to 3 as recently service has taken a dive."}
{"text":"This has to be the filthiest Cafe I have ever visited. Appalling customer service, attention to detail, and care for repeat customers.  The place was so dirty that we stepped on food and paper at least 3 times while trying to get to a table, which was also filthy.  The staff simply walked past the dirt and don't care to clean the floor or tables. No quality control or cleanliness, and will certainly not be going here again."}
{"text":"I have to say I have been to aroma several times now. The only reason why I go to aroma is the convenience of its location. Their coffee is OK. I've tried their London Fog, and have to say, it is too sweet and not enough Earl Grey in it. The prices of their menu items I would say is on par with similar cafes. But the service is rather slow. Overall I would say aroma is average. And typically I would only go to aroma if other places that I want to go to are busy and I don't want to wait."}
{"text":"I have occasionally dropped by this location whenever I have a craving for something sweet to eat. The staff has always been friendly and the service excellent! I never had to wait long in line to pay for food or to pick up my order. I really only come here for their chocolate Aroma cookies which are to die for! Always baked fresh and reasonably priced! These chocolatey cookies are thick and almost cakey in texture and coated in icing sugar. They are quite addictive and they sell them individually at $0.50 a piece or a box of 15 for $6.95. 

I have also tried their frozen chocolate beverage which is not that great. I think it needed to be blended more as I did encounter some chunks of ice and the flavour was bland - couldn't really taste the chocolate. I would probably try a different beverage next time I go there.

4 stars because the service has been consistently great and the cookies have never disappointed me (cookies trumps 1 mediocre experience with drink)."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. Decent amount of seating, restaurant was clean and bright, and I love that they have a patio.

I don't remember the name of the salad I got but I had sweet potato, lentils, cheese, and other stuff. But anyways, it was a really tasty salad and I'd definitely try it again. I also like that the dressing comes at the side and not in the salad. 

I'd grab a coffee or salad here again if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Yum! Just had the steak & egg sandwich (steak, medium cooked egg, sautéed red pepper, onions, aroma sauce) from here and it was delicious!! I also LOVE the breakfast sandwich. Well priced sandwiches for the win"}
{"text":"We stumbled into Aroma quite accidentally yesterday. On a mission to purchase supplies from a local business, I needed a quick \"pit stop\", and I cannot pass up a good cup of coffee.

My partner said he wanted the Mocha, I agreed to the same, and waited for this to be prepared. What I thought was a long time, ended to be WORTH THE WAIT. I will admit here and on this blog, that I am a Starbucks aficionado, however, after tasting this, I may have to re-think my choice of coffee houses. 

The flavor was something I wish I could describe. The rich mocha mixed with a not to bitter bean made for a wonderful pairing. They even gave a small piece of chocolate, wrapped individually with the \"Aroma\" name on the wrapper, just a nice added touch.

I understand that this used to be a Second Cup at this location. Well I welcome this new addition to the neighborhood. The decor is clean line, yet welcoming and cozy. There looks to be a wonderful menu of fares, although did not try, observed a couple enjoying what looked to be a breakfast platter to share.

For just \"a coffee\" you are writing a review?? I hear you....but it is now Sunday, and this was yesterday, and I still can taste that wonderful coffee and  the craving is in me to go back down and get another one. Maybe sit down and try out what else this place has to offer. 

Oh in case you are wondering why I gave this 4 stars, especially after my raves, it was THAT GOOD and yes, I will definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"A-OK coffee that's not Starbucks. Good flavours, has a food menu that wasn't tried. Has some sugar-free items that were tasty, especially the almond-nut cookies. Not especially fast, they could learn something from how the Italians manage complicated orders but pleasing nonetheless, and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"This aroma is weak at best.  But for a kiosk location what can you expect.   Their hygiene leaves something to be desired, as the plastic gloves stay on no matter what.  The cook answers his cell with the same gloves he was making your sandwich with.  That same phone he probably takes to the washroom with him on breaks.  Oh and when he has to step in on cash, same thing, same gloves then he goes back to the kitchen.   

I order coffee only here."}
{"text":"As I last recall visiting I ordered a hot chocolate and a sandwich.  Was a little pricey for half a sandwich, but it still tasted great but not exactly at the price I was willing to pay.  Usually you get a an entire sandwich at that cost.  Hot chocolate was yummy and the mini chocolate on the side added a nice touch.  Only really ate here because a friend of mine only ate kosher at the time."}
{"text":"It was an OK experience, nothing to rave about really. I found that the entrance to this location very confusing and not very clear due to the construction happening. I had to walk through the mall unknowing there was an entrance from the outside. I ordered the breakfast with two eggs and a side of turkey bacon (+1.50) Probably will not order this again, the price came to $8.99 not including a drink. My mistake for coming here. My food came out super greasy and no seasoning so it was bland. There are better places to get food in this area, I just chose poorly."}
{"text":"Service was veryyyyy slow and it wasn't very clear to the people coming in where to line up. It was very congested near the cash and the menu was so hard to read because of the small font. Overall I liked my all day power bfast. I just don't like the slow wait and customer service as much. Would be great if there was a loyalty program. Also the calling out names with the microphone is rly hard to hear and feels a bit old school Harveys."}
{"text":"There are way better options for coffee all within a 5 minute walk either way on College. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I really like this Aroma because it's close to work and it's a great change from the other food court options in the Eaton Centre. It also has its own little seating area so you can be away from the crazy lunch rush crowd. At first glance it looks like a pricey place but a sandwhich combo only puts you back about $10-12 which is roughly about the same price as the other fast food places. 

I always ordered the steak sandwhich without onions and I heard first hand the soups are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with the wait time and quality of food.  Waited over 15 mins for my sandwitch.  A lot of people were coming up the counter asking for their food and how long more it will take.

I've ordered take-out for a soy hot chocolate and egg salad sandwitch.  

The sandwitch was overpowered by pepper. The hot chocolate has a large lump of chocolate at the bottom.  If i'm paying $6 more then it would cost me @starbuck/second ... they could at least stir it fully for the chocolate to melt.  

$8 dollar egg salad which I can easily make for $2 at home using specialty bread shouldn't be overly peppered and they should offer the option of toasting the bread.  

No repeat customer from my end."}
{"text":"Best cafe/ restaurant in the area. I've been waiting for something like this to come along for years! Food rocks and you always have a little chocolate to look forward to on the side :)."}
{"text":"A great Israeli coffee shop that has finally made its way to Canada and now expanding in Toronto. I really enjoy the ambiance here and everything I've had from the coffee, salads, sweets, and sandwiches has been amazing!

Currently I'm addicted to the ice-aromas, whenever the weather manages to climb above 25, you can find me here trying to cool down!"}
{"text":"First star is for being the only coffee shop in liberty village on the weekend with seating. Second star for pity. Although they have wifi, so slow that it doesn't work. Not so friendly staff. Drinks are standard."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite with a friend of mine. This was a nice location with roomy space. If return here.

Food: 4/5, I got the new berry tea lemonade and it was quite good.

Service: 2/5, not much service required since you just have to pay it upfront yourself.

Ambience: 3/5, Big space and quiet and comfortable seats.

Price: 3/5, average"}
{"text":"Aroma, Aroma, Aroma. I should give you three stars but since I like you so much I'll give you four. 

Why should I give you three stars? Well, the coffee isn't that good and the music is just... well... awful. On a good day they're playing elevator music, on a bad day they're playing Ace of Base. Now, that's not to say I don't love Ace of Base (I'm a child of the 90s after all) but when you want to study, it's really hard to concentrate when all you can do is think about that time you were 9 and preoccupied with choreographing a dance to \"All That She Wants\" in your bedroom. The terrible thing is that I'll never know when it will be a good day (elevator music) or a bad day (90s pop). 

Despite all of this, I still love you Aroma, though part of me feels like I've been suckered into it.  

The staff there are usually very friendly. They try their best to get to know your name (which is easy, I guess, if you're a regular). 

Helpful hints: bring ear plugs if you want to concentrate and get work done, order an Americano over their drip coffee, and always, always, always take the free chocolate they offer (why do some people refuse? CRAZINESS)."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee or even full on healthy lunch or breakfast. Food is always ultra fresh and the menu is full of healthy choices. It's a great place to bring the kids or have a meeting in the corner."}
{"text":"Just came here for a coffee break with my family. My ice coffee was great and the egg and cheese croissant was delicious. I'm rating 2 stars because the woman handling our food and drink was actively coughing into her hand. Like coughed into her hand and then touched the rim of the drink I was about to have. Touched the plates she was serving her food on. It was disgusting. The manager was also behind the counter and didn't seem to mind at all. Please enact better policy in this cafe so that you don't actively contribute to the spread of germs and negatively affect your customers health. Gross."}
{"text":"Will not be back again to this location soon. Very disappointed with the actual food - the photos on the menu are so deceptively large and pretty.

I ordered the quinoa salad for $6.95 ish? And added on one egg, albacore tuna, and avocado. The salad looked nothing like the photo - much smaller and all the ingredients were separated. I like my food deconstructed, but not to this extent. The dressing was very standard and processed, probably from the grocery store. Didn't use most of it since probably pretty unhealthy. The avocado came as a mash in a tiny cup and the egg add on was literally 1 egg, which I paid $1.50 for. Never again.

Service was friendly and fast though, so pluses for that. And all calories are posted on the menu. Complimentary, self serve lemon water is available. 

Wifi is unstable since from the Eaton center."}
{"text":"10% discount if you are a hospital employee (i.e. wear scrubs or have a name badge)! But like all Aroma joints, the menu picture always looks better than the real deal. Portions are much smaller and less decadent-looking in person. There is also a lack of truly vegan options here. None of the pastries I believe are vegan and you have to be careful with the soups and salads as many contain egg, tuna, cheese, or all of the above. I ordered the \"vegetarian\" pumpkin soup, which they said does not contain dairy, with a chopped salad combo ~$11. Btw I would not recommend the Chopped Salad if you are looking for a salad with heartier, tastier ingredients as this one literally only has raw tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and carrots plus a lemon olive oil dressing that comes on the side. The soup tasted fine, but I like my soups with texture and chunky ingredients, which this soup did not have and instead was super watery.

The food court has lots of seating with washrooms nearby and there's free hospital Wifi. Not too loud, so a decent place to study during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"This was our first time at any Aroma locations. We agreed it was the BEST London Fog we've ever had. I ordered the yogurt, muesli and fruit. Sara had the warm chickpea salad. We were both pleased with size of our portions as well as the quality and flavour of the food. The staff were cheerful and helpful. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. I will definitely try Aroma in the future."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go to! I find the employees behind the counter lack presence - would be nice to get a smile or eye contact when being greeted. Overall a great location and drinks/food are always made well!"}
{"text":"Not worth going out of your way for, but if you are staying or working nearby, a solid choice for coffee and food. I liked the breakfast sandwich...egg, parsley, pickle, tom, and cream chese. Atmosphere is IKEA-mod. I think this is a chain, and it comes off that way."}
{"text":"Tried to order the granola and yougurt without the usual fruit but got a ton of attitude and a cup just half full.
Usually service is accommodating , not this location.

Otherwise , good basic standard fare."}
{"text":"I'm frequenting Aroma for a study spot, with it's modern interior, red Toronto skyline walls and winter themed drinks.  Perfect for snow watching with cider or coffee in hand.  It's got a clean modern aesthetic but manages to have a cozy vibe regardless.  Staff always seems pretty cool, with funny tip jar sayings.  Ask for the free wi-fi code when you order.  It's pretty busy but so far I've snagged window seats pretty often."}
{"text":"Food: I ordered the French toast and alfajores. Toast was great, but there was something off with the melon and honeydew. They didn't taste quite as fresh. Alfajores was really good though! 

Ambiance: For the most part, the ambiance is pretty relaxing and chilled out. I wasn't too thrilled when a couple of the customers started singing really off key though :/

Cleanliness: I haven't gone into the bathrooms while I was there but after reading some of the reviews, I was a bit weary about the cleanliness of Aroma. I did notice that some of the table tops were wet and some of the chairs had crumbs left over from previous customers.

Service: I appreciate the fact that the bus boys came up to the tables and cleared away dishes. Overall, staff were accommodating and friendly. 

Overall, Aroma on Bloor deserves a solid 3.5 stars but for now, until there is an update from Yelp, I'll have to settle for a 4 star."}
{"text":"Great people work here. Not only do they realize that they work in a hospital but they are sensitive to the customers about it. I had a delicious coffee, croissant and water. I highly reccomend this coffee shop to anyone in the building."}
{"text":"I don't agree with the bad reviews here, and I'm very picky. I recently discovered Aroma and they are a very neat coffee shop. They have tasty espresso drinks and cold drinks perfect for the hot weather in addition to tasty baked treats. Customer service has been consistently friendly. The space is clean and bright. No complaints here.

Also good for breakfast and lunch items (made fresh)."}
{"text":"Came here for a post workout grab and go sandwich and coffee.   $19 for a coffee and sandwich??? That's bc I asked for gluten free bread $2.25 up charge and not mentioned on menu and $2.50 for my added avocado order which was not forgotten (had already left the place).  So I was pretty ripped off for an ok sandwich and super slow service.  It's a big thumbs down all around."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their espressos are damn good, not anywhere close to Starbucks' crappy burnt espressos. The service is also great. I also love the fact that there are students working here and they do an amazing job."}
{"text":"Love this place -- if you appreciate black coffee, this place is where it's at. 

No clue what brand they serve here, but order a brewed coffee, drink it black and appreciate how smooth it tastes.

Bring your netbook (free wifi surprisingly makes my mouth water) and park yourself in front of the big plasma TV, order a sugar-free cookie to go with your free piece of chocolate and sit back and relax. Or work. Or people watch. Or contemplate life while the morning and lunch rush whiz by you. 

They're also open till 11PM most nights and have the most interesting little breakfast sandwiches I have yet to order. I've glanced longingly at a toasted bun topped with sesame with pickle, tomato and a hard-boiled egg sandwiched in between. Can't remember the name but it's certainly healthier than your typical breakfast sandwich.

Will be back and back again!"}
{"text":"sighhh must update this review and lower the rating because they no longer serve my fave sandwich :( nothing else is the same."}
{"text":"Recently made the \"switch\" from Starbucks and haven't looked back since.  Excellent coffee,  fresh pastry,  sandwiches to die for,  soups and salads. The staff as especially friendly and the ambience is great.  They also have a patio for those sunny days."}
{"text":"Lately I've noticed service has improved.  The initial stuffiness has toned down with service now friendly and relaxed."}
{"text":"Change the open/close times on Yelp and online. I walked down to get a coffee, door was open, and the girl said \"we're closed\" and I said \"it says 10 everywhere online\" and some young boy walked from around the corner and rudely said \"no, it's 9\". I'm a frequent customer at this location and won't be coming back after that interaction. Also, when your store has been closed for a half hour... lock your door."}
{"text":"This place seems to get a lot of hype. It is an attractive space and location. A great coffee place with a few problems.

The coffee, expresso, latte, hot chocolate, pretty solid. The croissants were also top notch. No complaints here. Reasonable prices and better than their Starbucks, Second cup competition.

As far space - packed and lacking cleanliness. The place is unfortunately stuck between a quick-stop or a sit-down coffee/cafe. The front cash is a cramped corridor and has a few standing/stools along the windows. In back, they have several round tables with very comfy lounge type chairs. Perfect for grabbing a seat, working on your laptop and sipping. But....

1) the wall plugs are capped to discourage campers. (I can agree with this except that it would be more effective if they just limited the wi-fi duration to say 2 hours? with purchase a la Starbucks)

2) the tables and chairs are left in shambles, crumbs, old dishes, which they have a person rounding to collect and clean, but can't keep up given the traffic

3) the bathrooms are a mess, toilets not working, bad odors. 

If you're gonna be a high volume coffee shop, you have to keep pace, ensure the place is clean and bathrooms in working order. Uncap the plugs and upgrade your wi-fi to limit access, that way you discourage leachers and not all your customers."}
{"text":"Aroma itself has an amazing menu which has insanely fresh and healthy ingredients. The entire ambiance of this cafe is ideal for coffee dates, studying, or just grabbing a bite to eat.

This specific location recently opened and the customer service is amazing! The cashiers are incredibly cheerful, nice and helpful! 
- also funny. Kudos to you.

Ive been to multiple aroma locations scattered in the GTA but the service at this one has especially stood out to me for being excellent."}
{"text":"This review is just a quickie as I did not get a real meal here. I got a soy vanilla latte and picked up a croissant in honor of national croissant day for the boyfriend. The latte was average price and average taste, I wouldn't rush back here for one. The croissants are made fresh all day and when I got it it was hot, that is great and that would be a reason to return. 
I have heard the other locations food is good but I guess I will have to try for myself one day."}
{"text":"Aroma Espresso Bar is simply delicious.
They have converted a Starbucks lover.
I am a little sad I even tried it though because I will have to go all the way to Toronto whenever I want it (which will be frequently).
They have the best steamed milk I have ever tried!
I ordered a small chai tea latte.
It had some cinnamon sugar or something on the top. 
It was heaven.
The small was the perfect size for me. It was a little over $3. So worth it. 
Every order came with a small little milk chocolate square. So cute and delicious.
My boyfriend ordered a latte. The steamed milk in it was awesome too.
I absolutely cannot wait to go back for more.
I hope they open café's outside of Toronto! I really loved this place!"}
{"text":"I like Aroma a lot but the staff here were really snotty and rude.
When I asked the cashier which he preferred; the marshmallow white hot chocolate or the white hot chocolate he replied \"neither, I'm a vegan\".
Can you have it with soy milk or almond milk? Is chocolate not vegan? I really don't know.
So I asked the guy which one was more popular. He looked at me and said \"Uhh I don't know\" and acted like I was wasting his time although there were no customers behind me. So rude.
I rephrased my question and asked which sold more to which he replied \"the white hot chocolate\". So that's what I chose.
They called my name and I grabbed my drink and sat down at the bar.
I had a few sips and asked the barista if she forgot to put the white chocolate in it, to which she replied very sarcastically \"did you stir it?\".
Lady, did you tell me to?! I've never had it before, you don't have to stir the ones at Starbucks and at least their baristas are kind enough to tell you if there are any special instructions (ie: be careful it's really hot, I've double cupped it, watch when you put the straw in, it's quite full).
So I stirred it and it still tasted like steamed milk with a hint of chocolate.
I told her I liked them really sweet and she dumped 3 more chocolates in it (not white chocolate but I didn't care).
And it tasted much better.
Everyone working there looked like they hated their lives.
I heard one of them asking to go home.

I really like the drinks and it's in the mall so I will be here again but their customer service was atrocious. Maybe it was a bad day. Who knows.

I want to try the steak sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Excellent Soups and salads.  Good service and friendly staff. 

My only problem is when customers sipping coffee out of empty paper cups are taking up a booth for four, and using the free wifi during busy lunch hours.  They should kick these kids out.  

Four elderly people were forced to sit at the small table to eat, while one girl not eating or drinking had all her stuff spread out on her booth table and the next booth was some guy doing the same but pretending to drink coffee.   

There is a library a few blocks down the street."}
{"text":"So here's what I heard:  This place is apparently the Starbucks of Israel.  Someone who worked on a food show told me so.

Whether that's true or not is largely  besides the point, because this 'espresso bar' opened at a corner across from a Starbucks and a Second Cup, as well as down the street from a Tim Horton's, and it's still done exceptionally well.  Of course, considering how much coffee Annex people consume, I doubt that even a man who sells coffee out of a thermos would go out of business.

But Aroma is actually good.  They serve good americanos, and their mint tea is another popular choice.  They have a selection of healthy sandwiches, all of which are great.  I really can't name one in particular because the sandwich you get will totally depend on the mood you're in.

The often packed store is in the process of expanding.  Pretty soon there will be extra seating space towards to the back."}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter. My daughter wanted to have one frozen yogurt cone. The taste is normal, but there was one thing I'm very unhappy! The cashier named Jessica didn't wash her hands before she hold the cone! She hold beyond the paper around the bottom of cone! Can't believe it! She knows it is for a little kid! I will never come back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is the worst aroma location to go to for a good aroma experience. Every time I go they are cheap with everything they do and service if they could charge you for the salt and pepper packets they would.my salads are always half portion and they always make sure to leave the container half empty which is already small. There is no aroma location that I have ever experienced with such cheap Service"}
{"text":"Today we decided to try the Aroma at Bathurst & Rutherford. The place was so busy that the lines of folks splintered off almost out the door. I paid about $30.00 for a few sandwiches and a teeny croissant that was charged $2.45. I can say with certainty that the place charges the more folks come to spend. The egg salad got rave reviews, but watch out for the giant portion of crunchy water on the breakfast sandwich
. Bring loads of cash and your cell phone to make sure people around you look at you, you lucky rich folks north of hwy 7!!"}
{"text":"Quite pricey, their match green latte is amazing though wish it was a bit bigger. Lots of great options for lunch."}
{"text":"Always quick and efficient - I primarily only get beverages from this location, but find that the service is always quick and have never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my beverage.

Only criticism recently is that the iced/blended drinks do seem to be a bit more watered-down (eg. not as frozen as they could be)."}
{"text":"4/5 because the service that I had was not the best. Not good at all actually. But, the nice space/aesthetic walls, easy to find location (right when you get out of the station/or mall @ Yonge & Eg), and free lemon water is worth the sass. Came here with Em and decided to try their froyo (I usually get their iced aroma because let's face it - it's a better version of Tim Horton's iced cap w/ chocolate milk... the mixture is muuch smoother and it even comes with a piece of chocolate on the side). I added a couple of tropical toppings: shredded coconut and pineapples. For about $5, it was worth it. The amount of frozen yogurt I got was a bit more than what $5 would probably cost at Yogurty's or Menchies (peep the pic). Tasted quite healthy too may I add. Though, I'd definitely recommend the ice aroma over their froyo any dayyyy! Em got a hot chocolate and enjoyed how riiiiich it was."}
{"text":"This location averages 3 stars and I'd say that's a fair rating. Good location, nice decor with a lot of natural light. Prices are on par with Starbucks, but the staff isn't as friendly as most Starbucks baristas...they're polite but customers aren't really made to feel welcome. 

Their coffee is decent, and some of the soups and salads are quite tasty. The sweets are pretty average, though, not bad but not great."}
{"text":"This location has a nice patio for summer but it does blast music really loudly. I tried the ice hazelnut latte and it was pretty good. They give you a little chocolate with your coffee or smoothie. Prices are like Starbucks tho. 

If you are looking to study or do work, this might not be the place for you due to loud music but if you just want to hang with friends it's a good coffee place.

Also, when you are finished ordering and paying at cash, you can just go find your seat and they will call your name on speaker to pick up the coffee."}
{"text":"They have great coffee! For all students, great atmosphere to study and free wifi (remember to ask for the password at the counter), but sometimes it does get a little crowded in the coffee shop, so sometimes no seats are available,
In addition, their food is amazing, must try their chicken sandwich and caesar salad!"}
{"text":"Really nice place, exactly what you expect from aroma; good coffee, and specially good food. They have a nice patio which is always crowded. Inside sitting area is a little small. But overall really nice place for coffee or midday snack"}
{"text":"I'm not a big coffee drinker so generally I avoid places like this, however, today I was on the search for breakfast and aroma seemed to have the best option in the food court. 

I ordered the breakfast sandwich. I had noted on the menu it said \"personal size\" or something like that... But didn't really think about it too much. Aren't all sandwiches personal?
I placed my order and the cashier asked me if I wanted personal size or... Then her voice trailed off. I asked her to repeat what she said, and was very rude in her tone. I was confused as to what personal meant because any freaking normal person would consider a sandwich on normal slices of bread to be personal. Turns out it's just Aroma's pretentious way of saying half sandwich. 
I also bought a bottles juice and a brownie. I wasn't given the brownie at the cash which I thought was odd, but figured maybe they put it in the bag with the sandwich.
As I sit waiting for my sandwich I watch the girl behind the counter sort of bitchily snap at another customer because he asked for his coffee while waiting for his breakfast to be complete. He didn't realize she still had to steam the milk and pour it in. She was really rude about it. 
So I get my whole sandwich in the bag and I look and no brownie. I asked the lady about it and she looked at the receipt and said I wasn't charged for it and just shrugged her shoulders.
That lead to my realization that since I got a whole sandwich the price from the menu was actually doubled. I obviously knew it would be more than the \"personal\" sandwich... But honestly, $9 for a sandwich with egg, cheese, pickle and tomato? That probably has a total cost of no more than $2! That's a HUGE markup!!!

Anyways, I noted that another reviewer commented on how the owner of this establishment \"hates starbucks\"..
Well let me tell you, if this had been a Starbucks, I would have been greeted with a smile, the other gentleman wouldn't have been rudely spoken to by the barista, and when they realized I had ordered a brownie and didn't get it and wasn't charged for it, they would have given me one for free. 

This place fails at customer service BIG TIME! It wasn't even busy to be able to use stress as an excuse. I won't ever come here again, because it's not deserving of my cash."}
{"text":"Although their coffee can be stronger... 

Aroma cafe has everything from delicious healthy low cal options like red lentil soup to the best way to spend a cheat day... Mmmmm warm Cheese Bureka... SOO good !!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time at aroma.  Their coffee, lattes and pastries are delicious.  Love the chocolate that comes with the coffee.  Also my daughter devoured her kids special."}
{"text":"?????Aroma,??????????????????downtown markham??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and bread is stale. Go to aroma in Richmond hill all the time,  and day and night difference, especially when it comes to costumer service."}
{"text":"Just shocking. Come here for bad coffee and the feeling that you're a bag of shit from the staff. Worst customer service I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Best Aroma in the city. Always fresh food. Staff are pleasant and plenty of seating. Menu has expanded recently."}
{"text":"Not your usual standard. Ordered the all day power breakfast. Salad was old and soggy. Rest of the food was good. They did make a fresh salad but why try and sell yesterday's salad today?"}
{"text":"This place was a lot more delicious than I expected. I came here for breakfast since it was across from my hotel so it was really convenient. I got a london fog and a egg and cheese croissant sandwich. Let me tell you, the London fog has the perfect ratio of tea and sweetness and the steamed milk on top is like a soft pillow. The croissant was flaky and soft and the egg was perfectly made (despite it looking very dry). I will have to frequent this place for breakfast when I come to Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday morning and the service I received was great! The cashier was very friendly and welcoming.

I tried to order two things off of the breakfast menu, but they said neither was available (because it was so early they were still \"defrosting\"... That didn't sound too good to me). Anyway, I ended up ordering the Muesli which was granola, yogurt, and fruit. I'm not a fan of melons (cantaloupe and honeydew) and that was the fruit that came in it, so I wish I knew that ahead of time. In most other places, it comes with berries.

There is plenty of seating and although it is situated in the middle of the mall, you don't feel awkward or claustrophobic. It's still quite open and spacious."}
{"text":"Another shamefully disgusting Aroma. Too bad because I love their food and enjoy the chain in general. The problem with this location is that they do not hire enough employees and as a result the place is a dump. There were barely any available seats because piles of dirty dishes had accumulated from previous patrons, left uncleared. There was lettuce on the ground! People, please have the manners to clean up after yourself! But also Aroma, please hire more employees!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Aroma chain in general, but this location pales in comparison to others. The restaurant is very very dirty - we wiped our own table down, scrubbing dried sauce off. We cleared the plates of customers before us. There were crumbs and food all over the ground. They need to hire more employees to keep the restaurant cleaner. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Great cafe! In a really convenient location and has a great atmosphere and terrace. The outdoor seating is great for hanging out.

The service is pretty friendly, but the lineup can get pretty long and the food can take a while.

Their steak sandwich was reallyyy good; beats any Tims or Subway sandwich, and really full of flavour. Might want to stay away from the real fruit smoothie though.

Overall, would definitely recommend this hangout spot, especially if you live nearby."}
{"text":"The inside decorations make the place feels relaxing.  The latte was great. Would come back."}
{"text":"I usually order their cafe au laits. Their coffee beans are not overly roasted - makes for a good cup of coffee.

Their food is better than Tim Hortons (and the price reflects that).

The piece of chocolate is an added touch (the wrappers change based on the holidays).

I've tried their shakshuka for breakfast. While it is not a restaurant level shakshuka, it was good for a quick breakfast. The eggs were not as runny and the tomato sauce lacked red pepper. The bread that came with the shakshuka was just bread (not toasted or buttered)."}
{"text":"Ordered two lattes and the cashier was nice. Lattes are so delicious even though it takes quite a while to make. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Now this is what you call a Coffee shop! okay fine \"Espresso Bar\" whatever. Really really good coffee (try the Aroma Mocha coffee mmm..) and I'm not a big chocolate fan but the piece that comes with the drinks just tasted so good!

My only complaint is they need to clear tables much more often given how busy the place is; there's trays and empty cups all over the place. But who cares, Aroma is exactly what I look for in a fancy coffee place and it's not even that expensive.

Overall a great place to sit down with someone and have a chat over some coffee and free Wifi."}
{"text":"NICE!  Spent some $ making a 'proper' coffee/lunch spot.  Great seating arrangements, spacious (not cramped!).  It's new and very crisp/clean.  A positive addition to a 'dead' stretch of Bloor St."}
{"text":"Another new, clean AROMA. so much superior to other chains.. Starbucks, etc. Salads are very good obviously good coffees."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings.

The first time I tried their lunch combo was great. I ordered the quinoa salad and the Mediterranean sandwich.

I came back today to try the organic kale salad with portabello mushroom and I was very very disappointed with the quality control over the freshness of the salad. See photo. I picked out about half the salad. I love the flavours of the goat cheese, mushrooms, with the balsamic vinegar and baby kale... I only have beef with the quality of the vegetables. It's yellow and spotty. They wouldn't eat it themselves would they? 

Torn wether I should go back... and I just when I got excited that a 'fast food' joint served organic salad."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to aroma. It has great bread and soup. It's a great place to do work as well. 

BUT the employees are the reasons for my lower rating and reluctance to keep returning. I have never seen any of them be friendly, welcoming, helpful, or have a sense of humour....you know... just plain and simple customer service. More times than not, they seem pissed, bothered, impatient and indifferent to customers altogether. 

I recommend going across the street.....to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Since my trip to Israel last spring, I have been itching to go back!

Aroma Espresso Bar helps to take me back, even for a few minutes as I soak up one of their delicious coffees or eat up a snack or a meal from this wonderful cafe has the Middle Easter and Mediterranean flavour I had during my trip!

I have gone to the Bloor Street location several times but with this new location now open at the Promenade Mall, I can travel a short 10 minutes from my home to Thornhill for a taste.

Like the other locations, the kitchen is an opened concept, so customers can see the freshness and clearful preparation of their food and drinks.

And everything is made fresh to order, not pre-packaged and made away from the cafe.

I really enjoy this place for lunch. I either go for a big salad or a sandwich.

My faves include:

- Aroma Special Salad

... a mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, black olives and a hard boiled egg, sitting on a bed of mixed greens and topped with your choice of dressing and additions such as tuna and/or feta

- Smoked Salmon Sandwich

... a yummy combo of smoked salmon, tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, cream cheese, all put on freshly baked bread


- Health Sandwich

- A veggie treat of mushrooms, sprouts, basil, topped with sun-dried tomato spread on freshly baked bread


For drinks, I just love their coffee. It is very flavourful! And I really enjoy their lattes and hot chocolate, which are rich in taste and thick with foam and have a cream texture.


I can't wait to visit Aroma again because I still have SO MUCH to try on their menu!"}
{"text":"sigh... Aroma, why do you have to continuously disappoint me?? I enjoy going to your café so much at the other locations, and when you decided to open in the Beach, I was super excited to take a break from my regular visits to Starbucks so I can enjoy your offerings. However, your repetitive lack of efficiency is not doing it for me and I find myself contemplating whether to give it another chance.

On my first experience, I went in, no one in front of me, and ordered my Iced Americano.... thinking it should take no longer than 3 minutes to drip the espresso and pour it over a cup of iced water, I was ready to get in and out quickly. The baristas stood around, like nothing was going on, and I was waiting there wondering if my order even went through. It took 10 minutes before I saw one of the ladies receive a glass of iced water on the pass (after I had to ask what was going on), got my drink and left. It's my usual drink at Aroma, and sadly, the Americano was watered down and lacking flavour.... Maybe it was growing pains so I'll give this place another try.... but 10 minutes is unacceptable... especially when there was no wait.

Today, I stopped in again to get a Almond Milk Green Tea Latte - placed my order, and waited patiently ... and then a latte shows up after several minutes in front of me. Obviously, I would not suspect that they would get my order incorrect, but I asked just to be safe. Sure enough, I was made a latte, not the green tea kind. Back to the drawing board again.

I didn't think I was even being that picky (when I can be - you can ask the Starbucks guys). But if the level of service and speed is what I'm receiving here.... I might as well go back to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Went to my usual spot I prefer over Starbucks today and got my order to go even when I usually get it eat in. They when the muffin was ready the cashier did not bother walking the few steps to the counter where people wait and just shoved there muffin in my direction. Not happy with the service I got today."}
{"text":"I was so luckily to stumble upon Aroma while in the Toronto area for work. The blueberry crumble is what got me through my day, and the friendly staff and the quick service is what will bring me back any time I am in the area. 

And here I thought Canadian only made donuts and made syrup well. Glad to see I was proved wrong."}
{"text":"By name alone I was expecting your standard fare coffee shop but this has a little HGH thrown in.  It has a sizable menu with plenty of option for a good size meal or snack.  I went with the small chick pea salad and it was much bigger than I thought.

The wee fee was good speed which was important to me since my smart phone doesn't work here and I was trying to yelp about where I was going to go next.

Nice service, no nonsense, fresh looking bread, and bold coffee."}
{"text":"Before writing my review, I want to make clear that I visited the Aroma on the corner of Bremner and Lower Simcoe. It JUST opened so there was no location on the map for it yet, but I had such a great experience that I wanted to at least give recognition to the chain. Great service, appealing interior and delicious food.  

This was my first time here but the gentleman at the cash didn't seem to mind that I was humming and hawing while I stared at the menu (I felt bad because I know this is annoying, ha)! Instead, he offered his help and talked me through a few of the items that I expressed interest in. I ended up ordering the breakfast sandwich with a kale and mango smoothie. Mmmm! Both were great! I sat near the window - the store had lots of seating and was very clean. I was also impressed by their menu. They seemed to have just about everything and could accommodate vegetarians, or dietary restrictions. Baked goods, meals made to order, you name it! I even noticed their attention to detail like having lemon water in a beautiful glass dispenser for customers to help themselves. 

You know the place is good when you want to head back to try something else! Thank you for starting my day off right, Aroma!"}
{"text":"I had never been to an aroma before, but decided to try this one out today for lunch with a friend. We arrived around noon and the restaurant was about 50% full. I started to notice that it got pretty busy with the lunch crowd around 12:30, so unless you're planning on doing take out, it might be a good idea to arrive a bit earlier so you can grab a table.

Our cashier was a bit clueless. My friend asked if they had cheddar cheese available as all she wanted was cheese slices on toast. The cashier said that they did have cheddar cheese, but said she needed to ask how to ring in the order. We found this a bit odd because it clearly says on their menu that options include bread for $1 and cheese for $2. So wouldn't cheese and toast qualify as those two options? Our cashier asked another server and the server indicated that they did not actually have cheddar cheese. Then it took our server three attempts to accurately confirm our order - at one point she actually thought that we had also ordered an avocado sandwich.

They have an extensive menu with a number of healthy options available. I really liked how there are lots of combos to choose from and lots of ways to customize your meal. We both selected the red lentil soup, which was one of their two soups of the day (the other was butternut squash). The soup is just over $5 and comes with two halves of bread (choice of white, whole wheat, and multigrain) and little container of packaged butter on the side. The soup was quite good; however, it was rather chunky as the lentils are barely (if at all) puréed. I prefer my lentil soups to be smoother, but this is a matter of personal preference. I noticed that there were other vegetables in the soup too like carrots, onions, and tomatoes. It was also noted that the soup is vegan. We both ordered whole wheat bread and the slices were very thick and fluffy. It was clear that the bread was fresh!

The restaurant is clean and service is quick. I will return to aroma again in the future for their lentil soup or to try out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"The skinny short dark cashier was easily annoyed just by my simple question of what half vs whole mean. He couldn't even explain it. So I ended up ordering way more than I could eat, $18 for a sandwich and a small tea. 

This place is clean and nice, has a lot of amazing teas. Would have given 4+ stars if it wasn't for such bad customer service. 

On a sunny day the window seats are really nice. Today it was snowing like crazy my feet were freezing sitting by the window for a long time.

Oh and during lunch on a weekday, there are a ton of middle school students here for lunch, chatting, some even play cards. I felt very old watching them lol"}
{"text":"I was appalled by the worn out seats. It's a terrible first impression. It's unfortunate, given it's not as busy an Aroma Espresso Bar location.

The lentil soup is consistently good. This time around, I had a chai latte. Although too sweet for me, it hit the spot."}
{"text":"An aroma is an aroma is an aroma. The lentil soup is exquisite and a constant nourishing dish. 

This is a larger location and the seats are not teared / falling apart as I've noticed in other locations.

The service was quick."}
{"text":"Aroma is a coffee shop with a wide selection of over-priced salads and sandwiches and croissants! I had a delectable coffee & croissant combo after my gym workout - yes, I know, but I love me my croissants! Unfortunately, this butter croissant was too soft and soggy. It was only 11am, so there should be no excuse for sogginess so early in the morning! The coffee - a house, medium blend - was passable enough.

The actual location is conveniently located inside the office tower at Yonge & Eglinton, overlooking the busy intersection. It has enough seating capacity plus a bar area for single patrons. Free wi-fi is always appreciated. Unisex private bathrooms are kept clean."}
{"text":"The cleanliness of this establishment needs to be remarked on. Dirty dishes left on the tables. Tables sticky with food residue. And the bathroom!  The men's room is not working & only the women's was in use. And dirty with unflushed toilets.

How can I in good conscience remark on the lunch I had when the place is disgustingly dirty?

What does that say about the kitchen? Or the staff's hygiene?"}
{"text":"LOVE Aroma. I usually try to come to an Aroma after work to finish up some work, and this one was great. Comfy seats and quick service. The location is nice and open, lots of natural sunlight. The outdoor seating is also very nice. 

The best part about Aroma is the fact that they have almond milk! The coffee is absolutely amazing. 

I only wish there were more outlets. Som"}
{"text":"Never came here due to the fact that I have always been a bbt fan and hence sticks to Chatime, Matcha, the Alley and everything else other than a normal cafe.  Friends came here after a late night snack at Kiu (a Japanese restaurant right beside it).  Decided might as well try something new since we always have the same thing every single week and Voila, have to admit their special Brazilian iced hazelnut latte is what I believed it to be called and it was pretty amazing to me at least.  Decently sweet and tastes like a Ferrero in a drink.

All my friends tried it and admired it to be pretty good.  Hence I will make the assumption that it was indeed pretty good as they all had a taste a few of them got the exact same drink afterwards.  Came late at night so was not able to experience what it was like during the day and it was pretty much end of their day so the drinks came out pretty fast.  

Overall, I would definitely go back again for their specialty ice Brazilian hazelnut latte."}
{"text":"Just got a drink from that place and provided a coupon for a free drink. I was only one in there and ask for Mocha. Took it and walked out. As soon as I try the coffee in my office it turns around i was given regular coffee. That was terrible experience and I'm sure that was because of the coupon i used. So sad."}
{"text":"Located inside Vaughan Mills, in the new part of the mall, across from Atmosphere. Nice place to sit down after a long day of shopping and relax with a drink and snack. We got the Ice Aroma and found it to be lighter than the ones we've had at other locations and quite thick that it was hard to drink for the first 5 minutes. Service is speedy if you're just getting a drink, however others that ordered meals and sandwiches seemed to have been waiting for quite awhile."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here already, you should definitely give it a try.

The coffee drinks here are very tasty, as is the free wireless (I spent just about every evening here when I moved to Toronto and was waiting for my DSL to be turned on).  The only problem with Aroma is that there's insufficient seating during the winter, but during the summer the large amount of outdoor seating makes this a non-issue."}
{"text":"When I moved to Corktown recently I was told by a friend that Aroma had the best coffee in the hood. I decided to give them a shot for my morning brew and I wasn't disappointed. I just stick with simple brewed coffee and Aroma's house blend is quite good.

I've delved into their menu a little deeper and was surprised how many food options they have. This place serves up all-day breakfast, including lots of soups, sandwiches, and salads. It appears they can make all of their food veggie, vegan, and gluten-free if you'd like. I've tried the breakfast and tuna sandwiches on whole wheat and they're both tasty -- and the bread is really soft and fresh!

The staff is also very nice and friendly. One downside is the prices are a little high: whole sandwiches are just over $10 which seems a little steep. Still, this is a great option for coffee, tea, and lunch snacks."}
{"text":"This is definitely a nice alternative to the Starbucks and Second Cup that are literally across the street from Aroma. When this place first opened up I didn't think it had a chance, but now it seems to be busier than its competition!

The place is spacious with the counter taking up a huge amount. But it seems to work more efficiently this way, like a Burger King. You place the order and they call your name. I got my coffee in about 30 seconds. Only problem was that there was no where to sit. The amount of laptops and people taking up entire tables to do their homework was a little upsetting. People would sit at a table for 3-4 with their papers all over the place and their bags and coats on the extra chairs. There has to be some way they can fix it so students don't loiter for hours with their laptops.

The bathrooms were in rough shape. The men's washroom looked like I was at a club, but I do like that they are proper washrooms for multiple people and you don't have to ask for a key from the counter. And I also like that you get a little piece of chocolate with your coffee.

I've only been here a couple of times and it's usually for things like cappuccinos and iced coffee, which are reasonably priced and tasted just fine. I would really like them to fix their seating. I went there with three other people and we couldn't get a table. That shouldn't be the case. Not to sound like an old man because I like working on my laptop in public as well... But don't forget us non-students who just want to sit down and enjoy our coffee, you know?"}
{"text":"I had wondered about this modern looking corner espresso bar.

From all the reviews I can't really argue about what anyone has to say. 
I was pleasantly surprised by of all things, the sandwich that the very helpful customer service person assisted me in picking.

I usually order a coffee at these places to see how much care they put into the basic brew but I was feeling a little adventurous so i ordered an americano. I really shouldn't have but I did.  It wasn't anything special. Damn. I really wanted a plain coffee too.

I had the chicken sandwich with arugula, mozzarella, mayo and peppers. Incredible. I haven't had a perfect sandwich in forever. I forgot about my coffee inhaling this meal.

Only thing I had to say going against it was seating. There was seating in the back but it was full at the time I went so I had to wait.  Patience is the key you will get seating shortly. I just watched like a hawk for the first person to move."}
{"text":"Students, entrepreneurs, work stressed professionals, your space has been presented. 

Location Is very spacious, plenty of tables, sufficient outlets for work space, free wifi, amazing chocolate. Anyone trying to find work space outside of home and a crammed coffee shop equivalent, this place is a great option. Could picture myself having meetings here. Healthy options which makes you feel like you're not cheating on your diet. 

Right next to subway station so easy to get to even on a friggin cold day like today. Gotta love Canada."}
{"text":"After roaming the streets for breaky I finally fell upon Aroma Espresso Bar on Queen. It was some what busy with people.

I ordered the French Toast. When I came I retrieved it from the bar and returned back to my seat. First I noticed that my \"syrup\" was a little cloudy so I open the serving portion to discover that it was actually salad dressing. Whatever, I work in the industry, it happens. Easy switcheroo.
Next I picked up my fork and noticed a stain on it. Whatever, so it's a little spotty. Rub rub, wait, that's dried on egg. Gross! Fine so they missed one. Switched for a clean one.
So the French Toast wasn't bad. Not great but not bad. Served with a side of fresh fruit and home made whipped cream. After getting through two pieces of FT I was about to dive into my fruit when I notice something on a grape. Yup, it was mold.

Three strikes, I'm out! See Ya never!"}
{"text":"I've finally checked this place out.
The lineups are usually insane, so I've normally walked in, and immediately walked out. I hapened to be walking by at 2pm, and it was empty enough that I thought I'd give it a try ....

 
I got the lunch 'deal' - 1/2 sandwich, small soup - i opted for the turkey BLT and mushroom soup. 

Oh, I also go the peach iced tea & 
and a butter croissant. 
 $17 later ... 

Turkey BLT - Had it on the multi grain bread. (choice of multi, whole wheat and white). The bread is cut literally over an inch thick. I'm not a bread person, so I ended up taking the top off. That's when I got to see what was really in the sandwich. 
Then when i did an internal 'oh, so sad'. :( 
1 piece of turkey bacon, cut in half to make it look like 2 pieces. An unripe slice of tomato (I took it off - unripe tomatoes are a huge peeve of mine), a piece of romaine lettuce, 2 slices of what look liked turkey cold cut (the same crap I buy at Loblaws). 

Mushroom Soup - errr YUCK? (can i say that?) 
There's a weird ... sweet (?) flavor that I just don't like. 
Had a few spoon fulls, and just couldn't stomach it. I'm sorry, it just wasn't good. 
(And I love mushrooms) 

Croissant - it was good. 
Nice and flaky, which I can appreciate. Fresh. 

NOTES: 
- My best friend said the red lentil soup is the best soup to pick, but to be honest, I won't be returning here. 
- The prices are insane, and I don't like the thick ass bread. I know it's all fresh, and made to order. But ...


I guess it's just not my thing. It's just not special enough."}
{"text":"My new favourite place for iced coffee.

Great new space; huge patio, and prime location for people watching along King St.

My dog and me give it 2 thumbs (paws!) up!"}
{"text":"My first visit to an Aroma based on a recommendation and certainly not my last. This one needs to compete with at least three coffee bars each with good ambience. Apart from first class coffee offers a far better and wider ranging snack menu than its competitors. Staff very friendly and efficient.
Worth a visit if you want to move up a notch. A good mid-morning rendezvous..."}
{"text":"The coffee drinks are all excellent at this Israeli cafe.

Hot outside? Definitely try the \"Iced Aroma\"...it's like a Timmy's iced capp but on CRACK. Amazing.

Feel like a hot sandwich? Their steak sandwich is seriously delicious...thinly sliced steak with roasted peppers and cheese. Really good. I get this sandwich with white bread but in fact ALL the bread at Aroma (multi and whole wheat) is of exceptional quality. Note: a half sandwich at Aroma may be enough if you're only feeling marginally hungry.

If you're really hungry, the all-day power breakfasts are a good choice...two eggs, cream cheese, chopped Israeli salad (cucumber, tomato, etc), olives and of course their famous bread.

For lighter fare, the aroma salad with tuna and/or feta is great too. The tuna here isn't creamy or mayonnaisey, it's healthier and quite light and tasty.

Red lentil soup, excellent. Baked treats and cookies--great quality.

I work across the street so I've sampled most things on the menu...I think Aroma is a class-act lunch cafe."}
{"text":"It is probably the most busy cafe I've been to and they don't have change for a $100, after I already ordered and showed her the bill in my hand, as if. Anyway, small portions/food is tasteless and not worth coming back. Sad to say Starbucks wins this round."}
{"text":"Amazing service and consistent food. I love their latte and ACE sandwich, lentil soup, multigrain bread. Fast, delishhhh, and good eating."}
{"text":"Review for Laird Location :) 

FRESH, CLEAN, SUPER FRIENDLY 

The food is always fresh, and filling. I usually get the warm chicken salad from Aroma, but I wanted to try something new. I got the Mozzarella salad and I was so glad I did nice chunks of mozzarella, fresh arugula and crunchy croutons. My husband got the chopped salad and he devoured it and refused to share lol. Both of us got the steak sandwich, nice chunks of steak, red pepper and oozing cheese.

The bathroom are spotless, always clean and well maintained, the first time I went there I walked right to the bathroom, because I really believe if a restaurants bathroom is clean then the kitchen and seating area is clean as well.  When I walked in it was sparkling and has been kept that way ever since. 

The tables are also always immediately cleaned and organized for the next customer. 


Lastly, their customer service is excellent. Always friendly and welcoming, I came with a few friends once who had never been to an Aroma so they were not familiar with the menu. The grayish haired lady and the man working at the cash explained the menu the special that they had at the time ( ORCHID LATTE !! YUM YUM YUM!!! ), the soup special and a variety of the sandwiches, both very pleasant. She even came by our table to make sure we didn't need anything, I loved it.


By far my favourite Aroma! 

Can't wait for this winter to be over to have my coffee on the patio :):)"}
{"text":"Shashuka - love the sunny side up eggs! runny yolk and thick eggy texture of the egg white. The tomato part tastes like Tostito salsa - great for dipping the bread 

Soup of the Day + Sandwich - Red lentil soup was delicious! A tomato based soup, tastes like chili. The Philly Chicken Sandwich on multigrain bread - huge portion! Bread was soo soft! Chicken was nice with a grilled taste, along with red peppers, swiss cheese, a bit of caramalized onions. Soup also comes with 3 slices of bread. 

Both meals are just under $10; a tasty and healthy alternative for fast food. I find their iced drinks to be pricey too. 

Iced Lemon Mint - sour and refreshing, great for summer. 

Coffee & Croissant Combo ($4) - love their chocolate croissant warmed up - a great sweet treat to indulge in! Coffee is great as well; so is the hot chocolate and apple cider."}
{"text":"Not bad: the service. Friendly staff and quick. Food is mediocre. Not many selections and selections don't rotate. Sadly, no bacon. And...no wifi. Ah, it's 2015. 

Atmosphere is good. Close by. Good place to go instead of Starbucks every now and again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to get a quick bite to eat before continuing my walk along Queen St. It was the perfect spot to grab something; right by Graffiti Alley. 

I ordered the berry tea and an egg Salad Sandwich. The berry tea tasted just like the one Starbucks makes. The egg Salad Sandwich tasted like any ordinary egg Salad Sandwich I had; nothing amazing about it. The crust though was tough and hard to eat. I left that alone. 

I also tried the Matcha Iced Latte which was spot on. I decided to come back on my last day to order another. 

The bathroom could use a little attention though."}
{"text":"Insert clever introduction using the word \"aroma\" here.[1]

We actually wanted to go to Snakes & Lattes. But they told us it would be a two and a half hour wait to get a table, and I was all... [makes shocked face].

So we decided to brave the (ever so slightly) nippy weather outside in search of a place where we could enjoy some hot caffeinated beverages (that wasn't Starbucks). Apparently everyone else in the city had the exact same idea.

On that note, you people taking a table all to yourself that would normally seat 4-5 people (by turning your laptop bag, your coat, your wallet, etc. into your seatmates): You're the worst kind of people. Well not the worst, but you're on the list of terrible people. There's Hitler, there's Kim Jong il, there's the guy who doesn't park within the lines, and then there are jerks like you. Actually there were quite a few of you in Aroma recently. Freakin' wi-fi squatters. Gahhh! 

The drinks were quite enjoyable. I haven't had the food, but the loved ones who tagged along seemed to appreciate whatever they ordered (chili or something? I dunno). I got the Mocha Coffee. And I stupidly added that piece of chocolate that they provide into my drink (because why not?). It didn't taste bad. It just ended up tasting even more like Hot Chocolate to me. But it was a yummy hot chocolate tasting drink. It could have been hotter (temperature-wise) though. Someone in our group got the Orchid Latte, which sounded odd but I tried a sip of it and I immediately regretted not ordering that. The rose water was obvious; it tasted flowery and yet very delicious all at once.

I can't speak on price. I handed my credit card to the fiancée; I know all of the drinks and food added up to be in the $30.00 range, but I don't remember individual costs so I can't be sure if the prices were reasonable (just off-hand, I'd say it's a little more expensive than other similar establishments considering it was only... 4 drinks and a cup of chili or something). 

The place was kind of dirty, but I'm going to assume that the miserable weather was the culprit leading to everyone dragging in snow, dirt, etc. from outside. I look forward to trying Aroma again when I'm not trying to use it as shelter from the bitter cold.

[1]Note: I've got nothing. The best I could think of was \"pun-aroma.\" But that was so stupid that I shouldn't even admit that I thought about using it."}
{"text":"I used to go there everyday since it located right close to my residence. I think the service is great. The boss of this store is kind and open-minded. They will serve you with great attitude. 

The coffees for sure are the best play in the store. I would think the drinks are way better than the food. However, it seems that some bartenders didn't know the menu really well. Sometimes they would offer me different kind of coffee. Clearly, they don't drink that much coffee as I do. I believe some bartenders didn't know the difference between Cortado and Canadiano. Overall, the foods are little pricy while the quality is just like average. Salad is the best choice for this store. Pancake and sandwich get pretty natural taste. People who like healthy style food would love it. 

It is a great place to study. That's the primary reason I go there everyday. They also get a variety of cookie and snacks. It is also a great place to hangout with your friends."}
{"text":"Aroma is as much a soup and sandwich shop as it is a coffee shop.

It is a clean, bright space that is not crowded. This works well for those who are using Aroma as their office.

The food is unremarkable. The warm chicken salad had way too many diced tomato pieces and is simply not as good as a comparably priced salad at Wendy's. The salad came with a rather average-tasting piece of bread.

I saw an in store ad for peach iced tea and added it. For 3$, there was no taste of peach, just an unsweetened iced tea.

You can have a decent meal here, just not a particularly great one for the money."}
{"text":"Aroma Ice lights are amazing. Location is clean and great service!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch before watching a movie at the theatre upstairs (love how convenient everything is here).

Ordered a shakshuka and an iced expresso. The shakshuka comes with some bread and some tahini. As it was my first time trying shakshuka I found it quite nice, the tomato based sauce is hearty and eggs are always yummy. I only wish the bread that came with it was either toasted or at least warm, but I still used it all to mop up the sauce. Around $15 for all of this."}
{"text":"Although I only stopped in for a coffee while waiting for a phone call, I was impressed with the decor, ambiance, spaciousness, cleanliness, and service. It was also a very good cup of coffee.

I loved the setup, with its mix of high tables, low tables, and lounge chairs. Classy, upscale."}
{"text":"Great selection of coffee, espresso and cold beverages. Lots of yummy fancy salads, burek and breakfast. Good ambiance and seating. Each order comes with little chocolate bar."}
{"text":"Oh Alfajores, how did I enjoy cookies before you came into my life?  Besides having fantastic coffee (definitely one of the better cups in the Annex), the menu is just great with interesting little additions that sort of step up standard chain-style cafe fare.  Stuff like their fresh mint tea that nearly made me weep the first time I took a sip of it and the tomato and cucumber side salad and haloumi cheese slice that comes with their man-sized breakfast plate and if you're a bread lovah like I am you will do a little jump-for-joy when you see the hunk of freshly baked bread that all come together to make a great looking plate of food.  All the food looks pretty tasty and I'd come here more often but sometimes it's so crazy busy during brunch hours it kinda stresses me out.  Also, the servers seem a bit downtrodden and watched at times...it almost makes me wanna give them back the alfajores to make them feel better...but it's just so yummy I can not do it!"}
{"text":"No wonder why my friend loves this place.

It's funny because at three of the four corners at that intersection, there was a coffee shop (Starbucks, Second Cup, and then aroma).  I went into aroma espresso bar to meet up with a few friends.  I got myself a well-recommended mocha coffee & an alfajores cookie.

The mocha coffee was amazing!  However, I was sweating a lot while drinking (wasn't so smart to grab a hot coffee on a 30-degree like weather day).  The alfajores cookie was okay -- was very different from what I expected it to be (granted, I never had one before in my life).

Great seating, very comfortable.  Free and unlimited wi-fi too, apparently!  Can't wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"Thank God I found this place, it's my new favourite place to go for espresso drinks. 
Great price, portion and quality. Love the piece of chocolate that comes with each drink! Wish they would open up more individual shops in north Toronto though!"}
{"text":"Looking to stay full for the balance of the day, try the Aroma Power Breakfast The Aroma Power Breakfast was created to fuel you all day! Breakfast includes two eggs any style, mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, carrot, olives, feta cheese, cream cheese, avocado spread, and a side of our freshly baked bread with butter. Add 1.50 for 12oz hot drink or soft drink.
The food was delectable and the huge cup of coffee was so good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better rating, since their food is mostly great.  However, their extremely slow and poor service bring down the rating considerably.  The only reason that I frequent this establishment is because I work in the area, and there's very few healthy food options for lunch.  This place is always packed, and the lineup is usually quite long at lunchtime.  I would recommend getting your meal to go, chances are pretty slim that you'll get a seat.  
The most frustrating part of the whole experience is that Aroma seems to be consistently under-staffed and/or poorly managed.  The lineup can be quite long, yet there's only one cashier taking orders, one person making beverages, and one person standing around at the counter.  It's not unusual to spend 20 minutes just lining up, ordering, and waiting for the order to finish.  I would recommend always double-checking your bagged order, since they regularly forget to add a spoon for soup.
All of this being said, their food is (for the most part) delicious!  Many healthy options, including vegan and vegetarian choices.  The red lentil soup is a personal favourite.  In my opinion, the food is overpriced, particularly considering the battle one most go through to order.  An average serving of soup should not cost $5.65.
I would recommend this place only during off-hours, and/or if you have a long lunch hour."}
{"text":"The best Aroma / coffee place around, and the chef is amazing, always consistent, makes it like your mom would... Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Great spot on Queen West for a coffee spot.
Lots of seating including a few booths.
They have great tea too, and the stay in cups are a massive size!!  Ding ding - we have a winner!

I did not eat but saw a lot of people grabbing food which I have to say looked pretty yummy!
Next time I will meet my friend for lunch AND tea. 

Free wi-fi, nice service too -- gotta like!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge cafe goer, but there are a few things I like about this place. There are some great salads/salad and sandwich combos, tasty breakfasts. The staff seem to know what they're doing. They call your name over a loudspeaker (yes, they even have speakers in the bathroom so you don't miss picking up your order). The things I don't like: 1. The price 2. This place is usually pretty clean and tidy. However, at 11:00 on a Monday morning, the women's washroom looked like a bathroom on Church St. the day after Pride. It was filthy - diarrhea in a toilet, toilet paper all over the floors, no paper in the stalls, a huge industrial sized soap jug, left sitting on the counter (help yourself folks and good luck lifting this sucker up). It was super neglected and made me question the condition of other areas that aren't so visible, like the kitchen...having said that, I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"Food is super fresh.
Nice combo options .Salads and sandwiches and fresh soups.
Would definitely go again.
Only issue is parking downtown oakville. Sucks!"}
{"text":"Aroma's concept is more similar to an Italian deli cafe than a Starbucks cafe.  I like that it has a decent sandwich, salad and soup lunch menu.  The cakes look sinful, though I have never ordered them.  The power breakfast is a good deal because of the fresh ingredients.  The Matcha Tea Latta is rich.  The espresso is not half bad, but I have had better at, of course, an Italian cafe.  I have never tried their cold beverages.  

The ambiance is contemporary, inviting, and minimalistic.  The servers at counter are polite.  They did get my orders wrong once, so the inexperience shows."}
{"text":"Aroma is known for serving great espresso and coffee, but for those non-caffeine drinkers, I'm pleased to announce it also has a fantastic array of herbal teas, especially their mint tea, which is real mint leaves sprinkled and then steeped in hot water. It's the winter version of a mojito (hummm, would rum taste good in that?).

They also offer really great sandwiches and a killer protein filled breakfast (eggs, cheese, veggies). Only problem is finding a place to actually EAT the food. In the summer, there's a huge patio on the side, but come winter it gets a little squished. The décor is sort of swanky black and red, but tables can be hard to come by because they offer free wireless and some people just never, ever, ever leave! 

Either way, I recommend you go for a tea, and try an alfajores cookie on the side. They're made of dulce de leche sort of caramel in the middle, super soft shortbread on the outsides. Mmmm......fatty-good."}
{"text":"This was the first of the aromas I tried a couple years ago. I go there often and to many of their city locations. 

The GOOD. 
+ They are only chain that makes a good espresso that never tastes burnt or old, and they are consistent. (unlike over rated Starbucks) + You can actually get some average priced food to be healthy, with salads and soups options etc along with your coffee. 

The NOT so GOOD
- This location is often really busy. - I've seen some pretty rude things done by York Region socially oblivious patrons (like being rude to other patrons). - People stare a lot at each other at the RH location. Which makes me NOT like how they call out your name on a speaker but in the city locations it's not so bad."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, made our sandwiches with two different types of bread. The egg salad had no flavour. No one knew what was going on. Customer service was terrible, do not recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to Aroma, the food and coffee were fabulous, the folks were friendly and service was fast,  it was pretty great. But lately every time I go my experience gets worse and worse. 

The kitchen can't seem to make toast in a timely manner, last time it took over 20 minutes, for toast. And so since you have to wait for your drink to come with your food I waited over 20 minutes for my latte, which was drip coffee and steamed milk. Yuck! Not a typical latte. My eggs came separately so they were cold and my bacon came 10 minutes after everything else. The staff was rude about it and so I asked to talk to a manager. Big mistake. She yelled at me defensively and was utterly rude, which explains the staff's response. Hot tip: if you want to keep your customers don't yell at them when they're trying to give you constructive feedback.

I'm never going back, the place is atrocious."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Friendly employees. 

I had the power breakfast. Two eggs with toast and a tomato and cucumber salad. It was great!

The Mochas are also made with actual chocolate. They put pieces of chocolate on the bottom of your glass and pour the milk and espresso over it. Delicious. 

Try to get there when they pull out the freshly baked cookies..."}
{"text":"Something new on the menu- bone broth. Don' t order it! If you're going to sell something that essentially is meant to be good for your health, you had better sell something that is authentic and made from scratch and not something that smells and tastes like Liptons chicken noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and located in Liberty Village which has a nice vibe. The WiFi requires a password which I could not locate.

I came in the evening for a coffee but the staff did not seem friendly or knowledgeable about the coffee. At first they told me it was fair trade then not when I asked why there was no fair trade badge on the bag of coffee beans.

I got an Espresso instead which was ok but I feel the place was all flash but no quality. It depends what your looking for, if your a coffee purist its not the place for you. Even as an alternative to Starbucks or Second Cup I feel they fall short."}
{"text":"Tried their new hazelnut latte with almond milk and it was decent. Their half breakfast sandwich was yummy but really small - for $5 I got omelette, lettuce, pickles and cream cheese on multigrain bread. Was a bit pricey overall - $11 for both drink and half sandwich! :s 

My friends tried the iced version of the same latte and did not like it - was literally like a milkshake! 
The staff is friendly and the patio is nice on a warm summer day. Not sure if I would return just for the food and drinks though!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot especially in the winter. I am not a coffee drinker and I dislike hot chocolate but in here, I don't feel left out with their assorted non-coffee, non-hot chocolate offerings. They have really cool tea flavours and chai latte! I sometimes want something hot, milky and coffee free that is NOT hot chocolate and in here, their delicious chai latte comes to the rescue. It is the best I have had and Starbucks, etc etc have nothing on these. Their little side pieces of chocolate don't hurt either. I actually saw one guy demand to have his chocolate when the new wait staff forgot to put it in his saucer lol. Now that's a true Aroma customer. 

I enjoy their orchid latte which should really be called orchid pudding because that is what it is. It's an especially nice hot sweet treat in the winter and feels like a warm blanket hugging you from the inside, mmmm! The nuts and spices add a very nice touch.

Their cheese danishes are among the best I have had in Toronto and unlike most cheese danishes I come across, these actually taste like the real deal. I am told their pastries are shipped frozen and then \"baked\" in store so I am curious about who really makes them. All in all, Aroma is a thumbs up from me and their free wifi makes it the perfect place for a class group meetup."}
{"text":"Welcome addition to the limited options on Queens Quay. A bit disorganized but that's probably due to the start up. Drip coffee was  good but the Americano decaf was watery and nearly tasteless. Almond croissant was good. Patio is a nice feature but currently adjacent construction can make it a bit noisy"}
{"text":"I love this spot. My stomach doesn't agree with Starbucks, so being able to come here during my breaks when I'm craving something good is convenient and a blessing. The staff are such sweethearts, friendly and welcoming, are very knowledgeable of their items, provide great service and can most likely accommodate to your diet restrictions (i.e they can provide you with almond milk, soy milk, gluten-free bread, etc.). There are times when I think to myself I probably shouldn't spend $5 on drinks so often, but it is worth it because they're so delicious.
My personal favorites are their soy lattes, matcha lattes, signature hot chocolate (which have Aroma chocolates at the bottom), Moroccan-spiced chicken and grain bowl , lentil soup, and their gluten-free sandwiches (I get the tuna or the avocado sandwiches) -all of which are out of this world.
It's a great place to meet up with friends, co-workers, or even with just your laptop and headphones. It is quite relaxing to sit out on the patio when it's hot outside as well. :) 
I always forget that Aroma has multiple locations because this place has such a local small-business vibe to it.
I highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"wow this place was busy considering it was a Friday afternoon. Cooled off with a nice ice latte on a warm summer day. I wish I was able to sit on one of their patio seats but they were all taken. I guess people didn't have to work that day just like me. Service was fast and drinks were refreshing and not overly sweet with great coffee flavor. $10 bux for 2 drinks but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Located inside Promenade Mall
Got a mocha and also some kind of lemonade type of drink ( I forget what it was called)
The mocha was amazing
The lemonade drink was awful
It tasted like medicine but good think I had chocolate snacks from Rocky Mountain which was right next door so that I can wash away that medicine flavour with some sweet chocolate."}
{"text":"This is my favorite branch of Aroma. It's laid back and cozy. I love their capuccino. It's good to have it at the store. The service is great!"}
{"text":"Employees don't know how to enter in that free muffin when you check in on Yelp. The whole process took 15 mins and they just kept talking amongst themselves. They didn't even ask me what muffin i wanted and even overcharged me for my latte. Pretty awful for a franchise that is supposed to be consistent in service."}
{"text":"This is the place I used to go a lot but recently I found their service is getting worse. The cashier was rude and yesterday when I went there to get lunch and when I was just walking a bit slow to the same lady, she literally yelled out saying next person here!!! she seemed very annoyed and of course took my order wrong.. instead of the lentil soup she got the tomato one instead. then when i asked for a takeout of the soup she simply said she cant guaranteed as they were very busy (in a rude way)... very disappointed to be 'yelled' at... other than that food is great... love the lentil soup and sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, healthy and they offer alcoholic drinks to boot. Iced Mojito anyone?

Aroma is everything that Starbucks should be, a proper cafe with food options that aren't microwaved. Fresh salads and soup options are all delicious and quick for lunch. Try the warm chickpea salad or the mushroom soup with the chopped salad. Both are solid lunch options.

Ooh, and don't forget a chocolate aroma cookie!"}
{"text":"I travel through Toronto often and like trying all the different coffees that are not Starbucks. And luckily in TO there is no shortage of coffee to try.

My Americano from Aroma Espresso Bar fell flat. 

You know that espresso smell that hits you in the face after every brewed pot? That intoxicating, madly rich aroma that drives you nuts? This place and my drink didn't have it. Sadly I wasn't able to see what kind/brand of bean they use because it definitely isn't one I would buy. I could be wrong too. They serve a lot of different items in this joint and perhaps those smells were canceling out their coffee. Mine was flat. 

I have to commend Aroma on the free chocolate with every drink; very clever marketing strategy and definitely makes them stand out from the rest. I wish I had dumped it into my coffee though - that's my one regret. 

In terms of atmosphere, this cafe is half low-key, half fast-food. Low key because it's a very relaxed and has some really nice decor that makes you wanna grab a table and get some work done. Fast-food because it's a very rushed process to get your order in and the barista looked a little overwhelmed. On top of that, the entire cafe was quite messy; nearly every table had garbage and trays on it and the milk station was filled with dirty cutlery and dirty plates. I don't know if it was a staffing issue for a Sunday afternoon, but man, clean up a little!"}
{"text":"The salads are pretty good here and very healthy. Tried the quinoa salad, pasta salad and the sweet potato salad. My favorite is probably the sweet potato!"}
{"text":"My daily espresso and occasional lunch spot. Friendly staffs. I use ritual to order all the time to skip the line as they are usually busy."}
{"text":"This place is a riot! The staff is hilarious to watch. Most of them have major attitude problems they've never been rude to me but it's really funny watching them with other customers. The food/ drinks are good, the wait time isn't bad depending on what time of the year/weekday it is. The prices aren't cheap but they have pretty good product. Overall I really enjoy this place. Keep in mind it is just kinda randomly in the mall. I'd only stop in here if I was already in the mall."}
{"text":"This lovely, bright restaurant is the perfect addition to the Beach neighborhood. It's not that we were lacking spots for coffee, but this resto offers a wide variety of healthy and delicious breakfast and light meals. 
Service is quick and staff are warm and welcoming. 
Have been delighted to see how busy this brand new spot is already!"}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad. Decent amount of seating, but definately doesn't give the impression that you can linger with your coffee or tea. Stopped off here to grab a tea post-meal. The set up is a bit too industrial for my taste. And the bussing happens pretty quickly. 

Aroma is set up like your typical coffee store and then they call out your name once the order is ready. The teas are loose leaf teas. I'd say skip the peppermint-ginger tea and try something else."}
{"text":"I ate here and got food poisoning. Questionable hygiene and rude staff. This place is hugely overrated"}
{"text":"Horrible service!
Absolutely incompetent employees. While placing the order had to repeat myself three times and they still managed to mess it up. The Manager is as rude as one can get. All of that would have been okay, had I not seen the manager pick the garbage off the floor, then go around the counter and refill the cookies for the customers. Think twice before you enjoy those sweet treats. That hint of something special is nothing fancier than someone's filthy shoe (that is the secret ingredient)
Like Aroma Cafe very much, but not that location"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast, they have authentic Israeli food, shakahuka or Israeli breakfast. 
If you are in the mood for something sweet get the aroma coffee, it's mixes with chocolate and cream. 
Their pastries are also very good.
Aroma is Israeli but they have restaurants in Miami, NY and Toronto!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning for breakfast was pretty quiet until noon rolled around. The staff are so friendly. It takes someone a while to come around and collect the finished dishes. It can definitely get busy really quickly so seats are hard to get. I ordered the Egg Salad Sandwich with a Chipotle Chicken Soup. The sandwich was really good but imo the crust was really hard. The soup tasted alright, definitely a big portion. But I personally wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is really good. Their hot chocolate is delicious and always warm. Great coffee and breakfast, aroma espresso bar is a great place for coffee and food."}
{"text":"So 3.5 stars is really what this place should get, but that isn't a yelp option yet. 

I've come here a couple of times and the experience is always positive. Food here is closer to restaurant than fast food (which is true for all Aroma's in my experience). They are polite and friendly, though food does take a little longer (probably because of the not so fast food feel of it all). 

One thing that really stood out to me was one visit when I came in to order a drink with a free drink coupon I had. While normally, this is accompanied by more disinterested and indifferent behaviour, the staff were still super friendly and helpful in helping me pick the most delicious hot chocolate with all the trimmings. Shoutout to the ladies who are all about the customer service at Aroma! :D"}
{"text":"The food is just ok. Somewhat tasteless and quite expensive. 

It's rare that I don't experience some kind of service issue. They obviously don't pay much for staff. There's a lot of dumb going on in here. Green grind down the street is much better and less annoying."}
{"text":"This is the saddest $10 breakfast I have ever had.  I ordered through Ritual and the first time I ordered via Ritual to Aroma, they screwed up and gave my order to someone else.  They did eventually make my order for me so I let it pass. 

This is the second time I have had their order screw up.  I ordered a classic breakfast where turkey bacon and eggs were supposed to come with bread.  I paid an extra $1.75 to have an egg white omelette.  I was also supposed to have jam/peanut butter with my toast.  

When I picked up my ordered and went up to my office, I was so sad to see that there was no turkey bacon whatsoever and the omelette was just sad.  There were two very sad whipped butters in there and 4 pieces of multi-grain bread in a paper bag. 

I am in awe I paid $10 for this and I'm actually really upset about this.  I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"It's a hard call between the mint tea made by pouring steaming water over fresh mint or the hot chocolate made by pouring milk over chunks of Belgian chocolate. So good."}
{"text":"I love a good aroma mocha coffee or fresh mint tea as a treat. For this location, drinks are delicious, consistent with other locations. Service was slow and odd.

Hours are strange, closing at 9pm Friday night. This location should be a prime date spot."}
{"text":"I got the Ice Aroma here and it tastes amazing! It's like a blend of espresso, milk and ice cream, the result is way better than what you get at Starbucks or Tim Hortons, it's really rich in taste and not just icy.

It's nearly $6 with tax for the large so it's kind of expensive, but it's a nice treat!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to sit when waiting for someone!
Came here yesterday because I had to wait for my friend. 

There is a lot of seating - in spite of the hustle and bustle, you'll find a place to sit. Aroma Espresso Bar is like the Grand Central Station of coffee shops on Bloor.

I thought the staff were really friendly and they seem to be happy at work. Love that they put your name on the cup and call out your name when the order is ready. 

Ordered the Pina Colada tea ... it was g o o o o o o d ! I found the pricing here quite reasonable too. 2.10 for any size of tea. They also have food so if you come in while in starvation mode, don't fret! You will be fed (granted you have the money to pay for it). 

The Annex isn't my usual hang out, but I'll be back when I'm in the area next."}
{"text":"Aroma is always so busy no matter the time of day, but it gets increasingly noisy the deeper we go into the night. Their drinks are on par with other locations, and service is efficient and cordial. The table arrangement could use a bit of work- a lot of tables are haphazardly placed within the middle of the room, and the lack of booths is regretful. 

It's hard to talk, study or work in Aroma because everyone is just so LOUD. The music is also earsplitting; it is very possible I went deaf in one ear. I probably would not stay inside of Aroma- if I wanted to sink into a lovely café atmosphere, I would head elsewhere. Besides that, their hot lattes are quite delicious (but the hot chocolate can definitely be improved upon- ugh)."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Marriott Eaton Center and I am so glad to have found this place. Today was our 2nd time back. A large coffee is huge, the food is good and the prices are reasonable. They even give you a little chocolate with your coffee. Love it!"}
{"text":"Got breakfast here twice and both times the scrambled eggs were overcooked. The cook in the back doesn't know how to cook eggs judging from all the pictures. The last time I ordered 'breakfast on the go', which was scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and cucumber. I also ordered extra turkey bacon. When I got my order it looked like they only used half an egg and I only got one slice of turkey bacon (for $1.50!!!!). Not to mention, the veggies were bitter. I wasted $8 and had to throw my food out because it was terrible. Do not eat breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Coffee is very good, soup of the day is delicious, as the bakery. The venue is nice....but the classic breakfast sucks."}
{"text":"I really like this place for their coffee, pastries, and portabello mushroom sandwich :-)
The atmosphere is very lively yet there is often shortage of seating as many patrons stay there for a long time sipping their coffee and doing some work or studies. I would not recommend going there between 12-2pm, all other times it's fine."}
{"text":"???????--??--?--breakfast coupon. ?????????ok?????latte, cappuccino, Aroma coffee?????????Aroma Coffee????????????????ok,?????????????????????????????????...."}
{"text":"Aroma has such beautiful menu items with delicious fresh ingredients. We were hungry and in the area and looking for breakfast food. 

So the match was perfect. We ordered our items, one breakfast on the go and one shakshuka. I was very excited by the shakshuka which is rather unique. Basically eggs in a bowl of thick red pepper and tomato soup. So warm and inviting especially on a cold day. 

The breakfast on the go surprised me as for some reason I expected a sandwich. But it was filled with veggies and some scrambled eggs. The only want in that dish was perhaps a bit more eggs. 

The shakshuka was delicious and pretty close to what I had imagined. However about 1/3 of the way into polishing it off, I discovered a label/sticker inside. It threw me. And all of a sudden I was not hungry anymore. 

The manager was very kind and asked me what I would like. I said I have no idea right now. So she waited and then came by a bit later. Eventually I asked for a breakfast sandwich to go and she made it and brought it to me. Hence the 3 stars.  

Was it not for the label I would have given 4 and were it. It for the manager it would have been a 2 star rating. 

I will come back eventually and have another shakshuka. But it may be a while.  And as far as aromas go, this one is very nice to be at.  So maybe I'll even try it again in this location."}
{"text":"Really slow service every time we come. It's too bad we have to wait 15-30mins for an ice aroma."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this location is the first time I've ever stepped inside one of these aroma espresso bars. I can't believe I've avoided it for so long, given how many of them there are around the city, but for some reason I've just never been compelled to give them a try. Until now, quite obviously.

I think I was drawn by the shiny new location. Something like the visual equivalent of new car smell, I just can't drag myself away from unscuffed floor tiling. Also, I wanted wifi and a plug.

I got both things. There's a decent amount of seating both inside and outside, and I saw that the patio was actually almost full, with happy lunchers taking advantage of the summer sun. I chose inside for the air conditioning and power outlet, which was not bad either. There are normal tables and chairs, high tables with bar-stool height chairs, and even low tables with squishy comfy seating. Goldilocks would find her ideal seating in here.

I'm assuming the food and beverages are quite consistent across all aroma espresso bars, but in case you are out of the loop like me, the food looked quite good, and the smallest size for a coffee is medium, not small. There were also little samples of what I think was cornbread, and that was actually quite delicious.

Overall, definitely fulfills the triple threat of a) ladies to lunch spot, b) study spot, and c) hanging out with friends for chats and sips spot."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to order a mocha coffee from Aroma Espresso Bar and all I have to say is: Eek! Methinks not. This was likely the worst mocha I have ever had. The beans, chocolate sauce (or whatever they use - hard chocolate), and ratio of water to espresso just didn't work. I also had the opportunity to chat with the Barrista and I was overwhelmingly disappointed in his knowledge.

Sorry. I can't recommend"}
{"text":"Really delicious place for a quick lunch - it was hot the day I was there, so I didn't have any coffee, but the food was really good!

The lentil soup was awesome, such a great flavor, perfect spices, just about as good as the lentil soup you get in Dearborn, MI or from real hippies.

The avocado sandwich with jalapeno, onion, egg and some other goodness was tasty. It would have been better as a wrap, as nothing really stayed put on the bread.

So, overall, this was a good experience that I'll have again the next time I find an Aroma."}
{"text":"Honestly the customer service is horrible here. I've never encountered such rude staff before at a coffee shop. I have been to many cafes before, and I can honestly say one of my favourite things is usually how friendly or nice the employees are at a good coffee shop. Most of them at this location (except for a few), pardon me, have a stick up their bumbs. Oopsie, it's true. Will not be going back here again.. also advising others not to if they don't want to experience rude customer service."}
{"text":"Love the coffee here. They need to put more people on staff. Waited 5 min to order my fix."}
{"text":"yAs super super love this location. Just grab some coffee and you will feel like heaven in a summer day. Nice and fast service in the place!"}
{"text":"this cafe is way too loud for me, more like a bar! You literally have to get the wifi password to connect w the internet, I mean come on! I ordered a medium latte, it's like a bowl size for me and I don't even wanna complain about the taste... I would prefer a Tim hortons double double please..."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a cafe that delivers on solid quality for food and coffee but also has the atmosphere where I can sit comfortable and work on some creative writing. 

This place has really nailed both! I've been to this location twice now and on both occasions I've been greeted warmly by the barista, the coffee has been exceptional, and food items prepared quickly. 

If you like a sweet hot beverage, I highly highly recommend their mocha. It is silky and dessert in a cup. Exactly what I want in a mocha! 

The food item I encourage you to order is their all-day power breakfast. The plate is huge for only $11 and includes a hot beverage (order the mocha!). My  boyfriend and I both ordered it and were blown away. We ate in silence as we couldn't be bothered with conversation while this ridiculously satisfying breakfast waited to be eaten. 

The atmosphere is quiet and comfortable. The music seems to be mostly chill 90's and it's at the perfect volume to focus on other tasks while bobbing your head to Remy Shand. Lots of seating with a variety of table sizes means no real waiting for a spot.

I'm so thrilled to have tried this cafe, just a block from my home!

I have not had the chance to visit another Aroma location, but I will definitely stop in now, based on my experiences at the Queens Quay cafe. 

-Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"Not as quick to deliver as the local Starbucks but I go here for the freshness of the breakfast items, which Starbucks seem to lack since their breakfast items are all premade.

I highly recommend their sandwiches for breakfast, the sliced bread is the best sliced bread I've ever had.  Doesn't taste like a crummy sponge like Wonderbread.  It has set a new standard for me.  My favourite is the multigrain.  It comes in half-sizes, perfect for me."}
{"text":"I live in the building above aroma (The Motion) so I spend a lot of time in and out of this café. Sometimes they can be a little slow, but 80% the service is great, and they know me by name :) Very cute spot.

I highly recommend the chocolate croissant or the main breakfast - all the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"Lots of reasons to like this place:
- coffee is served with a small piece of wrapped chocolate
- self serve water available
- spacious patio (great for people watching)
- a few cozy booths (but hard to snag)
- lots of natural light
- clean bathrooms

[3.5 stars, based on 4+ visits]"}
{"text":"Decent chain coffee place.
They try to keep it clean.
Tried Alfajores(cookies with condensed milk)and fell in love :)"}
{"text":"Parking: Free - big lot with easy to find parking.

Washrooms: Dimly lit, clean during the mornings when I go in.

Experience/Venue: All the staff are friendly and know me since I'm a regular at this location. I go here everyday Mon-Fri for my daily breakfast.

Food: The food is good. I've tried the portobello sandwich, the avocado sandwich, the lentil soup, the shitake mushroom soup, the quinoa bowl, the Mediterranean salad, and the warm chickpea bowl. I excluded egg and cheese to make it vegan. Definitely recommend the mushroom dishes."}
{"text":"As Nicole said, the service is a bit wonky. 

Got my chai latte made with milk, instead of soy as I had requested, and subsequently had to stand and wait for it to be fixed. Another woman noticed that a customer that arrived later got served before her and began to complain. The barista tried hard not to admit his mistake and told her that he was making it soon. Thank goodness she refrained from starting a screaming match.

My drink however, tasted like over-sugared stale water sprinkled with spice. I ended up drinking HALF of it and just left it on the counter.

Blech."}
{"text":"Aroma is an Israeli-owned chain that has become popular - through word of mouth - since its birth in Toronto. While I had heard many friends raving about this place, when I finally visited, I was still skeptical. Not my first pick for a hang-out, as I'm not a fan of decor here, but there are a few menu choices worth coming back for. 

The bread here is baked fresh and offers the perfect texture. My vegetarian sandwich (apologies as I can't remember which I ordered) was oh-so-tasty, down to the last bite. The chickpea and egg salad was simply overwhelming in size, easily feeding a second person. Ingredients were fresh, although the accompanying dressing was plain. 

The one thing that really bugs me though is what I've echoed for the Yonge/Eglinton location: the soy chai latte is appalling and a poor excuse for a drink. 

Convenient location, but hit and miss on several factors."}
{"text":"Although there's lots of aroma espresso bars in Toronto now, but this is the first time for me and it's amazing! I love their tea collection, which really distinguishes itself from Tim hortons and Starbucks! I got the toasted hazelnut white tea, which is really one of a kind! 

The mini chocolate that came with my order was also a wonderful surprise, thanks aroma espresso bar!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to for chats or meeting. The management just went down hill by so much!!! Will never come back
- only one person on a Sunday afternoon 
- wifi not working
- barista does not know how to frost milk
- left over trays no one is cleaning(mostly because of the one person running the whole show)
- flys around the espresso bar area"}
{"text":"The whole check-in to get free muffin with your hot drink thing is just never available. They run out of muffins and they don't want to hand you anything else instead, not even a small cookie. The salads are usually not as freshly prepared as at other locations. Thus, the patio is a cool area to enjoy an afternoon tea with a nice breeze. Not my favorite location."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, quick and descent service at the counter, clean location, nice outdoor and indoor sitting area with lots of room, suitable for kids and groups."}
{"text":"I went for shopping to  sq one today with my daughter and my younger son. Whenever we go for shopping we have to stop by Aroma Espresso. I love their coffee and Bureka sandwich. The combination of boiled egg with tomato and the white sauce i guess its tahini , is really good. The sandwich is always very fresh. I have tried the brownie and carrot cake too, its nice. My sons likes all kinds of iced drinks. My daughter tries new stuff each time she goes. Its a nice place to hang out with family or friends."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot!

It was one of those mornings where you're actually on time for work and could really use a pick-me-up. I went in anticipating a huge line up and was so, so wrong. I was the only person there. I ordered an espresso & breakfast sandwich to go. 

The breakfast sandwich was unlike anything I've had before. Who puts pickles on a breakfast sandwich? Well let me tell you this. It was incredible! Multigrain bread, eggs, cream cheese, pickles, parsley, tomatoes and lettuce. It was actually pretty amazing and I regret nothing. I've also sampled their warm chickpea salad at another location and that was fairly appetizing (and filling?!).

The service at this location was perfect. The morning crew is friendly and attentive. Nothing too over the top which is preferred at 7 in the morning.

I have to admit, the chocolate with the espresso is a nice touch.

Update: I am hindering the review from a 4 start to a 3 based on today's experience. Went in on a Friday afternoon around 330pm to grab 1/2 lb of ground espresso beans. It took some time before the cashier came to the counter. 

I asked for the beans and she stared at me blankly saying \"I don't know how\". I said, \"don't know how as in, how to gring the beans or how to ring it in the machine\". Her answer was \"yeah\"...? I asked if there was anyone else who could help me; she looked over at her coworker and said \"we're both like, new here, sooo\".

It was super irritating. I had purchased the same order a week prior as a gift and thought I'd get some myself. Aroma, train your staff! 

I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Aroma really have to pay attention to this location! Lineup every time on everything from cashier to the serve. I have been to another locations and they are all good and efficient but this one is always unorganize and slow since day 1. The order is pretty simple  like salad and smoothie. Strongly not recommended if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Aromas is becoming one of those coffee houses that are opening up very corner like few other coffee houses we know and love to go too. The great thing about this place is that they have healthy food choices, I just love there chicken sandwich, it's so tasty. The only compliant I have is for them to stop with calling out your name to pick up your food, it can be a bit too distracting and loud."}
{"text":"New coffee place for the Yonge & Eglinton area!

I went here for my lunch I'l have to go back and actually get a coffee and try their other choices. 
I was just grabbing lunch to go - I got a half tuna sanwich.  I enjoyed it, it's quite a generous amount they put in there and the toppings and garnishes were good as well.

Staff was friendly and I like how they ask for your name so when your order is ready they call out your name - it just makes it more personal.

I liked the atmosphere and seating arrangements it looks refreshing and not over crowded. 

It's a shame they didnt open during the summer they would have had more business but I think things will warm up for them.

I will have to go back and try the coffees and other sandwiches at another time"}
{"text":"This location was bustling on a Saturday afternoon, but I managed to snag a table with friends just in time. I'm a fan of the seating here - very comfortable and there's a handy ledge at the wall to dump your bags onto, which invariably seems to be something I require.

The rager behind the counter was another matter. She looked like she had seen far better days, and I feared my order might be thrown in my face. Ah well, not everyone can be their best 24/7. She was more of a quiet seether type, not an out and out screamer. 

Good coffee and the fact the bathrooms are NOT in the basement scores a whole star all on its own."}
{"text":"Another one of the Aroma chain so if you've been to one of the others you'll probably know what to expect!

Treats here look tasty-including mini cupcakes. I was trying to be good (read: I was mildly nauseated from excessive chocolate and peanut butter consumption) so passed, but the mini red velvet cupcakes were very tempting! Medium coffee is a reasonable $1.90 and I still love it that they give you a little chocolate. Or maybe even two! There are lots of coffee shops around...but how many give you the chocolate you want with your cup? 

The girl serving me today was lovely and the place has a nicely chilled atmosphere. Seating is comfy couches, chairs and booths with a small sunny patio section outside. Only one washroom that I could find but it was roomy and pretty clean with one of those Dyson hand dryers. They're still a bit of a novelty for me!"}
{"text":"One of life's great simple pleasures for me is curling up with a cup of coffee, some chocolate and a good book. It used to be so fun to do that in a coffee shop-until wifi. Now most places have hard wooden chairs like it's an office and like they're hoping you leave soon. Aroma is different. It actually has pretty comfy little armchairs! It was buzzing when I ducked in to shelter from the mid-May hailstorm but it's pretty roomy and I managed to snag myself a table with some of the comfy chairs.

It was a pleasure to get a nice mug of coffee and getting a little chocolate with it is a nice touch. It's a tiny little thing but changes the experience from the purely functional Tim Hortons run to a pleasant experience.

Staff were lovely and service was quick. It's a bit loud in there due to the sheer volume of people in the cafe but I still enjoyed my little time out and book reading. I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Aroma at the Promenade is a nice change from the standard coffee chains for a few reasons: one can actually get lunch there and they know your name (admittedly, they do ask for it).

Salads and sandwiches have been top-notch and precisely as explained on the menu every time. Specialty coffees and the Ice Aroma are worth it, once in a while given the calorie content for the latter. Standard coffee is average.

One thing about this place that I mind is the ambience. Either the seating area is incredibly poorly laid out or the clientele just likes pushing people around (I believe it's both). The clientele is mostly noisy and downright rude, and a few of the staff fits right in. If you can get past that, however, Aroma can be a decent, if not crowded, place to grab lunch in the middle of the mall."}
{"text":"New location, nice patio, friendly greeting/cash out, but my experience was somewhat strange.

I ordered an Iced Americano, requested less ice, and it arrived at least 1.5\" from the top of the cup.  When the barista asked if I wanted \"more water\", I said yes, and she literally turned on the tap and shamelessly added more water.

I found that very odd.  Shouldn't your servings be more or less consistent?  Why are you adding more water...from the tap into my cold drink?  Don't you have a filtered pitcher or shouldn't it be topped up with more espresso??

This has never happened to me before, so it I left with a less than good impression of this location."}
{"text":"Somewhat difficult to review as I had 1 cold drink, stayed a coupla hours to do some writing...on the coldest day of the Winter!

What drew me here was the view via the floor-to-ceiling windows.  Instead of being stuck in a cubicle, I opted for a café, with free wifi, and perhaps some background noise.  So that's basically what I got, no surprises there.

Drinks were pricey-ish, along the Starbuck Grande/specialty line, ~$5.  I ordered a Lemon-Mint Iced drink.  Weird, I know, since it was like -15, and I didn't want anything caffeinated, yet wanted something refreshing.

Music was loud and not the best station.

If you're there with your laptop, try the lower chairs.  Stools were quite uncomfortable.

Tip:  Do not sit on the Saarinen-looking stools!  I tried one and it was very wobbly, quite unsafe actually.  So I switched to the other one.  Not entirely stable, but still a bit dangerous if you have to hop on it with your Winter-gear on."}
{"text":"Just had an awful experience at this location. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and a chipotle chicken soup (which one one of the soups of the day, the other was ten lentil which is my least favourite). First, they told me multi grain bread was not available so I opted for whole wheat. I was waiting for 20 minutes for my order. One of the workers just handed to me and said \"sorry we lost your receipt so your order was late\"  ..ok. So I walked back to work and discovered that they had given me the wrong soup! Red lentil, my least favourite! Then I opened the sandwich and the bread was soaking wet! It didn't taste like it normally does either. For $12 and not one thing was right? More than disappointing. Will not be returning.

*update* the business contacted me and apologized for this frustrating experience and is even sending me a gift card. A+ for customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times to work when I have meetings in the buildings connected to it.  It's relaxed, gets rushes at the usual times (ie lunch hour, breakfast).  Wifi works well.

My main complaint is the tables are usually not very clean, even when there's plenty of staff and no one in the place.  Had a sandwich (ordered two drinks afterwards) and my plate sat on my table for over 3 hours...

Also, asked about the chicken broth they market as a drink being homemade on site, was told yes...turned out to be made with powder and hot water :("}
{"text":"Great service, wifi, nice small patio.  Good place to go and work for an afternoon if you're in the area or if you live in Liberty Village. 

Also, amazing greek yogurt and cherry pastries!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe with nice seating outside. I didn't try any of there cafe beverages however they have very good sandwiches and they are a decent size even for just a half. I had a very good grilled portobello sandwich and my friend loved their breakfast sandwich. Also, allow I am not a red velvet cake fan, my friend attested to how great their red velvet cupcake was."}
{"text":"Service was veryyy  slowwwww..

There were only 3 people ordering, I was the third person in line, by the time the barista finished with the previous 2 customers, the barista forgot what my order was!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Probably some of the most friendly staff in this area. Super convenient, fresh ingredients and fairly quick on the food prep. 

I had the red lentil soup and a smoked salmon sandwich. A great combo for a cold January evening. The total came to about $18 because I chose the full sandwich. I'm pretty sure I could have got a lot more for my money but it's the overall experience that keeps bringing me back."}
{"text":"My first time here and the food was delicious and my coffee was brought out quickly. It's a cute atmosphere and the ladies behind the counter are such sweeties."}
{"text":"This aroma location has been my go-to place for coffee for years, as it was fairly close to my old apartment.The coffee was good, and I absolutely adore the green tea latte and hot chocolates. Recently I've been stopping in to try out the food, and that's where the 3-star review comes from...

Service is very VERY slow. Placing an order can take up to 10 minutes sometimes because there always seems to be some sort of miscommunication between the cashier and the costumer. Once you've placed your order comes the looooong wait for your food. I ordered a chicken sandwich, and waited 35 minutes for it. Granted, there were a lot of other people waiting for their orders as well, but like me, they all had to wait between 30-40 minutes before seeing any food sent out.

Great place to visit if you have some spare time and don't mind waiting for food - and great drinks!"}
{"text":"3 out of the 4 corners in this intersection have coffee shops and Aroma is for sure the best. I was in Toronto for the weekend from NYC and needed some coffee - aroma did not disappoint! Not only was the coffee amazing but the food was so fresh - they bake their own bread multiple times a day. Add in the fact that they offer free wifi and Aroma wins every time."}
{"text":"Service is unbelievably slow. I ordered a sandwich and that took them 30 minutes.
I give them 0 star if I can."}
{"text":"This is a great Aroma, that manages to get even custom orders correct. Rarely too busy, and a fast kitchen, too. 

Food is comparable to other Aromas. 

Parking is a little crazy because of the bottleneck where it is. Otherwise, no issues!"}
{"text":"Lovely little patio to have a coffee on a nice day. I've had the Aroma coffee, mango smoothie, grilled chicken sandwich and avocado sandwich. All of them were great! Favourites were the chicken sandwich and coffee. A half sandwich is large enough to get you full and the coffee is filled with melted chocolate! Sooo good, especially for a sweet tooth like me who isn't fond of the coffee taste but needs the caffeine. Worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"It smelled like heaven inside here."}
{"text":"They closed the kitchen at 930pm 
For you're scheduled to be closed at 10pm, it means that is when you clean up. It doesn't mean you leave at 10pm at the expense of denying your customers half your menu. Then why are you still open. 
Rude staff as we."}
{"text":"Aroma at Vaughan Mills is the perfect balance between being convenient enough for a quick bite/drink, but also homey enough to bring a laptop and get some work done.

The Power Breakfast is good - the 3 spreads are delicious (especially the goat cheese) and go well with their fresh bread. The eggs are served your way and are well done. The salad, however, was forgettable. The kicker bringing my rating down to 3 stars is that the coffee is also pretty forgettable - a step up from Tim Hortons (a pretty low bar), but just barely better than Folgers."}
{"text":"The only Aroma I have been in which lacked that Aroma laid-back vibe.  Very stiff sort of a place.  Slim pickings in terms of choices.  Strong smell of butter coming from the kitchen - maybe I went there too early (around 8:15 a.m. on a Saturday).  Maybe I missed the good stuff.  Not my first choice."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer*  I have not eaten here.

I had a meeting this morning, figured I'd take baked goods to the meeting - and asked if they had a box for me to take a few baked items - to go.  They were back and forth and finally - no box.  (I left).

1.  Train your staff - i.e. they should know if boxes are available; and
2.  Why don't you have boxes - you could $ell more baked items that way!!!!

Not the usual Aroma standards.  The counter staff looked like they wanted to be anywhere but there."}
{"text":"Allright, nothing more than just OK and average in my opinion.

Giverette, you need to speed up the service!

The breakfast (stuffed with pickles/eggs) boureka was OK.  But not worth the very $eriou$ly expen$ive price.  And honestly, pickles with a boureka?  Coffee could have been stronger.

Won't be running back any time soon."}
{"text":"Barely 3 stars for the coffee - was borderline weak and I was searching for the taste ... lacked any depth.

Hardly any skim-milk left and the person behind the counter looked like she didn't want to be there - which meant I did not ask for more milk.

I remember when Aroma franchises (I am assuming they are) opened up all over the place.  My last couple of experiences throughout the city have been underwhelming at best.

Rating:  between a \"meh\" and \"OK\".  Won't be running back any time soon."}
{"text":"The clientele are enough to drive you round the bend.  Too much caffeine?

The coffee IS good here.  Stong and smooth.   High-caloric bourekas which did not look too tempting.  Coffee was good ... nice lady serving (Oct. 14) in the mornings.  Management should recognize her nice nature and patience ..."}
{"text":"Never eaten at this place before, but it's always crowded and I decided that must mean something. I was running errands and hadn't eaten the whole day, so decided to finally give this place a shot. I ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea.

The iced tea doesn't appear to be iced tea. It was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice. It was inedible. It was super gross. I was thinking that maybe they made a mistake, but I can't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order, poured the drink and gave it to me SAID it was iced tea. Sooooo ew. 

Sandwich was alright, but just alright. The \"aroma sauce\" which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good. The bread was good, but the chicken was the sort of cheap, crappy chicken you find at Subway, where it's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat, with fake grill marks on it. It had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich. 

There are soups, salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well, so I'm not writing it off just yet, but this was not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Okay, this is beginning to be a recurring problem at Aroma! This is the second time I've ordered a Caesar salad and yet again, found another insect died in my food. 

I thought it was just at one aroma location, but now here too.


No more buying food at aroma for me! 

Another picture for proof."}
{"text":"Never ordering food here ever again!!! 

I ordered a Caesar salad to go today and while waiting for my food to be prepared, I couldn't stop myself from thinking and staring how one person could make all kinds of food in a crammed corner like that. 

Anyways, my name was called and I picked my salad and headed back home. 

Once I took out my salad from the paper bag, I turned the salad box upside down and noticed a DEAD FRUIT FLY!!!!!!! at the bottom of my salad. A leg from the fruit fly also broke off from the body. 

I wanted to throw away the salad - but told myself it's just one fly. No biggie. 

So instead of eating the salad from the salad box itself, I decided to transfer the salad into a separate bowl so that way I could remove the dead fly from my food. 

I was still paranoid from finding that one fly in my salad that I decided to inspect each salad leaf while transferring into a separate bowl. And then....

I found another dead fruit fly in my salad!!!!!!!!!

What the heck, Aroma ?!?!?!? 

Please train your staff to clean the food properly!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate to go. By the time it cooled down enough to drink, we found that the hot chocolate tasted like thin, milky water, later finding out that the chocolate was at the bottom of the cup. I either didn't hear, or wasn't told, that I was supposed to stir the hot chocolate myself.

I cannot fathom why customers would have to stir their own drinks. Don't they have stirring apparatus behind the counter? I don't have to stir my own drinks at Starbucks, or any other cafes that I've visited.

Aroma customer service stepped up, however; they were apologetic and issued a few vouchers for free drinks. It's nice to see that some companies still know how to do customer service properly.

On subsequent visits, staff told me to stir each time. The drinks were tasty. Pricey, but tasty. I just still don't get why they can't stir the drinks before they hand them over."}
{"text":"This Aroma location is by far the best one I've ever been to.  I've tried others and will continue to frequent this location.  The owners and staff are super friendly and they treat you as though you are family. It is not often you come by this in a franchise restaurant. 

The food is always fresh and well presented and you can tell it's made with care and \"love\".  It really shows that this location puts true effort and passion into everything they prepare for their customers.  

I have yet to see this place look unkempt. It is always very clean and inviting looking and the energy here is always pleasant.  

I really enjoy everything about Aroma at Leaside."}
{"text":"Just keeps getting worse. My last experience will be my last. I was over charged for something - which really wasn't worth an argument over (around $5 on a $37 bill). When i pointed out something was wrong, it was all downhill from there. It was an argument and i was insulted, made to feel like an idiot, blame displaced onto the 'system'. Very pointless really. 

In the end, once i opened up the takeout, i found the issue all along was an extra salad i didn't order (hence the extra charge). What get's me upset though is the effort spent by three staff member to tell me how wrong i am, and no one took the effort to just double check the order. The sign from the owner placed in the store says text me for feedback. Never heard anything back either. 


The point really is, this place has gone to crap over the past little while. No need to support them anymore. I like the chain, just don't like this one."}
{"text":"I love Aroma, but this place really needs to stop hiring people who can't speak English that well. It takes 5 mins to place an order - for a place that is already slow enough. 

The service here is an issue, but i'm still happy to have an Aroma in the area. The food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Ah it's been a while since i've been to the orginal Aroma that i would frequent almost 3 times a week, but since the Y&E construction, they've had to move within the building. And truth be told, since the move, the service has really gone down. But it's still good food."}
{"text":"Meeting family up in Bathurst we decided to opt for a quick brunch before starting out our day in Toronto.  Lines were long and we thought, could mean great food!  We found out that long lines at Aroma meant slow service.
We had ordered two Eggplant Quinoa Bowls, two of the steak sandwiches and one Pasta Bowl.  The two Quinoa Bowls were okay, they were a lot of filler and only three very thinly sliced pieces of eggplant.  My pasta bowl was awful.  There was a bed of arugula and peas at the bottom of the bowl, on top was plain boiled noodles with a small sprinkle of feta and two kalamata olives.  They gave an oil based dressing on the side.  There was zero flavor to this pasta bowl.  For a handful of arugula and boiled noodles, way over priced, even with the exchange.  When the steak sandwiches were ordered and a temperature for the meat was not necessary, maybe at that moment we should have questioned it but we had just met up with family and were catching up and didn't realize until it was too late.  The \"steak\" was that thinly sliced steak 'um type meat you can buy frozen at any grocery store that is prepared by microwave......yuck!  Both people with the sandwich said the meat was too tough and chewy.  There was not a single empty dish on the table when we were ready to go.  Toronto is a second home for me, I will steer clear from Aroma going forward."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times before, but the last visit is literally my last time that I'm ever going back to this place. After ordering my coffee and a small meal(both on the pricey side) I look for a quiet place to sit, I find a spot near the back of the cafe, minutes later I'm asked to move as their closing the section down to clean it, without even offering me even a moment to get up & leave the space,  the employee starts abruptly moving chairs around and drags a heavy table making a loud and extremely annoying screeching sound. I'm thinking to myself what the heck!? cant you offer me a chance to get up & walk away before you start dismantling things and making a whole bunch of racket! I went their to try to relax and just enjoy a coffee with my meal instead I get caught in what felt like an intrusive and Noisy construction zone. Plain & Simple No courtesy = No customer."}
{"text":"Yay! I AM a fan...

Sooooo many food options (meat, veg and even a few vegan and gluten free - hello quinoa salad). No this isn't FINE dining or gourmet food. But it's decent and perfect for a quick bite or a casual get together with friends.  I'm liking the teas and coffees too. But mostly I am super impressed with the food selection here. 

They've been open over a year now and I believe have worked out all the previously mention service kinks."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Located in the heart of the Annex, Aroma is packed mainly with students; that said I've seen many a freelancer or old folk on their lap top here. Good luck getting an outlet or some decent lighting, however.  I will have to give the award for worst lighting to Aroma, especially the back section of their Annex location. Their Eglinton location is really nice - a bit more spacious than its downtown counterpart.  That said, the Annex location has a great patio if you're lounging in the summertime. 

I ATE 
I've been to Aroma a few times and their quality is top notch for a café. In cold weather, I opt for the hot chocolate. It's one of my favourites. They add real mini chocolate bars in the drink for an extra sugar rush. They also give you a mini chocolate on the side (as with most of their drinks). I like that added touch. Their iced Aroma (light) is always great for a brain freeze (in the best possible of ways).  What I really like about Aroma, however, is that they don't skimp on their menu.  Their sandwiches are hearty and healthy. I always get their chicken salad or their salmon and cream cheese sandwich. Both will fuel you if you're hanging out for over two hours (yes, guilty!). 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Smell the aroma and get over here quick. But if you require some light (and also don't want to go blind) I'd taste test their Eglinton location"}
{"text":"Loved the place! Perfect for breakfast/brunch! Service is adequate, atmosphere is not bad, considering that it is located inside of quite  a busy mall. My latte was good and my steak sandwich was great  - fresh and crunch crust with tender pieces of beef!  All in all, a great choice if you happen to be in this mall and decide to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Aroma is a chain, much like starbucks. They serve coffee, tea, some specialty drinks but their menu is definitely better than starbucks. This location is pretty large, there's space to work or for a coffee date. Free Wifi. They have pretty decent salads and sandwiches, and also serve breakfast. The cash register situation at this location seems to confuse most people for some reason, so it might take longer than usual to order at this location. Bonus, you get a free chocolate with your coffee."}
{"text":"I'm really happy this place opened up. Such a welcome relief from my daily (lazy) visit to Fresh & Wild, one of the most expensive places on earth! 
I ordered the Quinoa Salad & Soup special. The salad was lovely and fresh with lots of veggies. The soup on the other hand was horrible. It was a Quinoa Chicken soup and anyone that cooks with Quinoa should know it needs to be thoroughly washed to remove the bitter taste before cooking. They clearly didn't wash it as the soup was incredibly bitter & totally inedible. Yuck.

I will definitely come back and try another soup, I think this place will be high on my lunchtime rotation."}
{"text":"This is the better of the aromas that I've tried. They have a small selection of sandwiches and soups and the place is brightly lit contrary to their Bloor/Bathurst location. 

They also have very good chocolate croissants. Like all other Aromas, their coffee comes with the chocolate and I find that it tasted fresher than other ones I've tried. 

Can't wait to try their patio when it is warmer!"}
{"text":"This place is not the best for coffee but it definitely has more seating spaces than Starbucks across the street. It also has a bit more selection in terms of baked goods so it gets another star for that. 

It is a very convenient location so it is also quite busy and the tables are not cleaned all the time between customers. 

Their coffee, however, is not the greatest. I much prefer their tea."}
{"text":"Very nice espresso even if the one I stopped in was located in a mall. I can see my wife leaving me here to read and drink while she shops. Thank goodness I was just in town for a work meeting and just want a shot of nectar of the Gods beforehand. 

Recommend but maybe try another standalone location?"}
{"text":"I think it was my second time at Aruma.
We ordered soup and Tuna sandwich. I have to be honest and to admit that we were planing to go to  Landware coffee tight across the street.
Since Landware coffee was full and we could find available seats we went to Aruma which was half empty .
The food was bad , the Tuna sandwich was dry ( like the Dead Sea ) and the soup was insipid !!
And it was not cheap at all.
Thank you Aruma it's definitely my last visit ."}
{"text":"This was my first time at any Aroma and was definitely impressed. Wait times were short and the drink we ordered was delicious. 

We ordered the ice chocolate and it is truly a competitor to the Second Cup frozen chocolate. In fact, it's more creamy, which I personally like.

Overall, the coffee shop seemed busy, clean, and casual. It felt like a great place to just relax and maybe read a paper on the weekdays."}
{"text":"I had a super yum latte here! 
There are also some great menu items. Some are so good your co-worker's dog will steal it :("}
{"text":"Perfect little spot on nice hot summer days. As sitting inside during the summers are freezing!!  Also a bit small inside. But for casual coffee. And no need to buckle down a lot of work. Good place to unwind"}
{"text":"As you would expect with any Aroma's. Quiet and unassuming. More of a diner feel as oppose to Starbucks which is more of a living room feel. Colourful and modern furnishing. And never too busy in this location. If you live in the area. This could be a small hidden spot"}
{"text":"Their hot chocolate IS really good! I was told by a colleague to try both this and the almond croissants (almond paste smeared on either a butter or chocolate croissant) and I loved both. Though I wouldn't recommend both at the same time - that might be overkill. 

I've also had the Americano. It was unreasonably delicious. And I love the little piece of chocolate on the side.

A word on getting a table: If you have a meeting, I would suggest going a bit early to snag one. This tends to be a very busy spot and they aren't always speedy with clearing tables here. But what they lack in cleanup, they make up for in friendly service!

Happy sipping."}
{"text":"Good spot to go for a breakfast on a hangover Saturday morning.

Ask to grill the sandwich even if it's not offered on the menu, it takes the taste to whole new level.

Also, their literally melted chocolate in milk a.k.a hot chocolates happened to be a perfect choice in a chilly weather. 

Location is convenient from Bloor street, and they have patio seating for good weather, which is never there when I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"I am SO happy that I found this place! I just moved back to Toronto, and was on the look out for a good study/work place. I had been working from the second cup on University/Richmond which is good but this is a FABULOUS place. First off, the service is awesome - the baristas are all friendly, efficient and nice. Second, the coffee and the food is really good. They have plenty of options for a quick lunch. The ambiance and the layout of the coffee shop is perfect for someone like me. By the looks of the place, it seems to be a popular place. And no wonder: wifi, bold coffee, good food, good service - all in all , a winner!  I'll definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"This is a vaguely nice place to sit on Queen St, in an interesting neighborhood. For this reason alone, I'd likely come back.

But the actual coffee here (at a self-proclaimed espresso bar) was poor. I hope to return and find something more palatable on the menu."}
{"text":"The absolute slowest coffee place I've ever been to. 

I clocked the cashier, it took her 11 minutes to take our order. 

This lady was fresh off the boat. Israel I'm guessing, from her accent and facial features. 

I didn't realize things moved so slowly where she comes from. 

The Americano here is ok. The coffee is ok. Their iced beverages are really good.

I just wish this place understood the concept of \"time is money\" because it never fails that this place lags.

You also have to keep a constant watch on what they're making for you. Every now and then they mess up your order in the weirdest way."}
{"text":"Best hot chocolate in town! Thick chocolate at the bottom, hot milk poured on top, sprinkled with chocolate powder, and a piece of chocolate on the side. Stirring is part of the fun, drinking it is rewarding, and eating the chocolate afterward, nothing else could make you feel this spoiled for five bucks. Now go treat yo self!"}
{"text":"First of all, they were out of bread, in the middle of the day. When your menu is primarily sandwiches, you should probably not let that happen. Place was a mess, with food and garbage on the tables and floors, and service was a bit chaotic. Cashier was pretty confused. Other Aromas are so clean and well-run.  Why does this one have to suck?

Food was ok, albeit overpriced. Gave me something cold and I asked to warm it up and the person acted like she never heard of that before."}
{"text":"Service can be hit or miss here. They've messed up my orders multiple times and even when I pointed it out, no one was ever very apologetic. Don't come here for a \"quick\" anything... During weekend mornings, expect to wait up to 15 minutes for takeout breakfast. I like their food but I only come here when nothing else is open because it's usually not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nothing in life is free, except the small piece of chocolate that comes with your coffee at Aroma! :o)

Their latte is the perfect temperature--not scalding like Starbucks. The espresso has a really nice flavour.

The alfajores cookie was pretty interesting. The shortbread was really soft and crumbly, and the centre was caramel-like--but having a Spanish-sounding name, I'm going to go with dulce de leche.

The croissants are awful. The plain ones and the chocolate (Nutella?) filled ones.

They have food too. Looks like a pretty big menu compared to other coffee shops. If you're into food and coffee, this place seems like a great place to go. Definitely beats out Dark Horse in the food department, and I would go as far as saying that the coffee is pretty similar too."}
{"text":"I have bought food from Aroma twice.   First, an egg breakfast sandwich.   The next time I got the albacore tuna sandwich and the warmed chickpea salad.

Each time, I can't believe how gross the food has been.  It's not really a meal as much as it is a bunch of ingredients in a bowl or between two pieces of bread.   

It's clean and relatively fresh but it just doesn't taste any good.  At all."}
{"text":"Newly opened in downtown Markham this aroma has the same decor as the typical.  Went on a Saturday night and wasn't too busy with good service.  One thing I didn't notice before was that they have a chicken bone broth which was great for the start of a chilly fall evening - a good change up to a coffee or latte that is usually get."}
{"text":"I have worked in the area for three years but this morning was the first time I visited Aroma Espresso Bar. I think I am in love!! This place is so nice and bright but also warm and cozy. I love that they have a patio! I ordered a café au lait, cheese raisin roll
and a greek yogurt cherry Danish. The cheese raisin roll was ok but I really like the greek yogurt cherry Danish and the café au lait. I will definitely be going back many more times. I used to be a regular at a major coffee shop franchise starting with S but I won't be going there anymore. Aroma is a hundred times better when it comes to service, food and coffee."}
{"text":"Aroma usually has a great atmosphere. This one is no exception. Well-adapted to Vaughan Mill's high traffic with tons of seating and an open layout.

Ordered my regular matcha latte, as usual they use a generous amount of matcha and are careful with the foam.

I received good service by 2 ladies, 1 whom was clearly new but very friendly. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. So slow! Had to ask several times for my order which they forgot. This is common at this location."}
{"text":"I find that a lot of corporate/franchised coffee shops, drip coffee is decent but lattes are not up to par. At aroma, the  latte was not terrible taste wise- the milk was not burned, and the taste of espresso came through. Presentation is where there was a major lapse in quality. When the milk is dumped in without care and there is no latte art, the drink is not as enjoyable. It just doesnt taste as good. 

So, although the latte didn't taste bad, it is not one that I would want to drink all the time. 

Oh yea, if the owner is reading this, dont serve latte in standard coffee cups!"}
{"text":"My group wanted to get bubble tea but Chatime was full as always and it didn't have enough seats for everyone. We were going to try bubble tease across the street; again there were not enough seats for my group. We found Aroma empty so we went in.

The tables were really dirty; there were wrappings and empty cups. No one came over to clean them so we did.
 
Got an iced tea berry flavour drink. It tasted very healthy. You can add sugar water or some honey-like thing to your drink to improve its taste. If you get one of their iced coffee drinks, it comes in a fancy looking cup with a red lid.
 
We were finally getting started with our chat time when the lights went out. I was here on a Saturday evening and really, they close at 9 pm? There was free wi-fi."}
{"text":"One of the worst lattes I've had in awhile. There was barely any espresso in my drink, all milk. Oatmeal was equally uninspiring. There is a lot of seating though including outdoor."}
{"text":"It's a bit noisy here due to the construction around Yonge Street & the entrance being hidden. It's a nice cafe. The decor is modern & new-looking. I tried the alfajores & they were yummy. Next time I want to meet a friend I'll go somewhere quieter though."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying to eat here. I think I keep forgetting how bad it is. Anyway I was really hungry so this time I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich. Something in it was probably bad because about 30 mins to 1 hour after I ate it I got stomach pains & stomach upset. Not fun. I don't think I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"Got the portobello sandwich here for a snack after shopping at MEC. Wow super expensive & it looked like I got half a sandwich. The bread was delicious though, I have to say. This aroma is a good size as well & their outdoor patio is a great size. Right on the corner of the street so conveniently located."}
{"text":"I bought a snack here after coming out of the movie theatres with my family. I got the mini red velvet cupcake & mini black out cupcake. They were absolutely delicious! Moist & fresh. Soooo good. Service was pretty standard for a coffee shop within the mall. I would get those cupcakes again they were so yummy."}
{"text":"Batista's too busy yakking it up with buddies to notice they totally forgot my order."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Aroma in the city! The service is an absolute joke! I actually had something wrong with my order more timer than not (unfortunately that's the closest Aroma to my home so i have been here plenty of times). The food is very good but it has nothing to do with this Aroma and has everything to do with the head office."}
{"text":"I like Aroma in general, but this branch on Queen is probably the best! The fact that the owner Greg is always there makes all the food and the drinks come perfect and if anything is  even a little bit wrong you will be treated like a customer should be treated with immediate replacement and \"on the house\" stuff. Extremely recommended!!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location of Aroma twice now. Because it's in a very busy mall, it tends to be quite busy and a bit noisy, but it's a very nice location nonetheless. 

The first time we were here, I ordered a latte which was delicious and the barista was extremely friendly. My son ordered an iced chocolate (like a thick milkshake) with a scoop of ice cream. His drink was also delicious.

Today my husband and I both ordered the affogato (an espresso with a scoop of vanilla ice cream) because it's an extremely hot day and we are sitting on the patio. The drinks are absolutely delicious. We may have another :) It was the same barista as the first time I was here and he was equally friendly despite being very busy.

The patio area is very spacious and a great place for people watching."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since shortly after they opened. The drinks are great and the atmosphere is so inviting. We love sitting upstairs where it's usually a bit quieter. The baristas are all so friendly and obviously take pride in what they do. Love this place. Oh, and they even offer all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"My previous review was not very favourable, however, they have improved since then. The unpleasant smell from the washrooms is gone, they have installed additional locks on the doors and overall it seems cleaner. There is still a bit of a shortage of toilet paper at times but the cafe itself is well maintained and I am very pleased because now I can come back there and enjoy my formerly favourite location again. Also, Aroma in general has expanded their menu and have more options if you are gluten intolerant, vegetarian, or health conscious. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"love this joint because of the layout of thr place. they have booths separated by glass panes and multiple seating arrangements. free wifi and although it says no outside food or drinks, no one said anything when my friend and i brought in our own desserts to pair with out coffees"}
{"text":"My first time at an Aroma Expresso bar and I loved it. It is a refreshing change from Starbucks, and although I am not a fan of franchised anything, I really enjoyed the ambiance, service and fresh products this location had to offer. Yes they have pastries and snacks, but it was the coffee I came for and they did not disappoint. I went with something very simple. An Expresso with a some vanilla icecream. Simple, but very delicious. I am sold and will definitely try one of their other locations sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Aroma Espresso Bar is everything I need in a coffeeshop/cafe/patisserie. 

-I needed a soy latte the afternoon I arrived in Toronto - Aroma was there.
-I needed a quick, tasty breakfast the next day - Aroma made me the most delicious fig and goat cheese breakfast croissant.
-I needed dessert. Aroma provided adorable, crunchy sugarless cookies to dip in my evening hot chocolate.

There are few establishments that offer BOTH really great coffee (always served with a tiny chocolate bar) and really great food, but somehow Aroma has defied the odds and managed this feat."}
{"text":"I was here last night and I've always been impressed. This is a better version of Starbucks with more neighbourhood feel (they hire the locals, oy!). The servers are friendlier and the coffee is at par with Starbucks. 

Lately, my Starbucks taste bud is dissipating and moving towards to more organic and local coffee. 

There is a free wifi inside so do not expect to be seated when school starts - this is like a library with tons of keyboard-pushing students that order one cup of coffee. It can be noisy at the back due to loud music (perhaps to annoy chair hoggers) so make sure that you stay to the front of the cafe. 

They serve coffee in mugs and not the environmentally-disastrous coffee cups. Think business class seats on the plane. I am pretentious I know, I still buy Starbucks Americano weekly. 

The mini chocolate that comes with your coffee is a nice touch but is generally useless - why do you need chocolate with your coffee? 

The price is reasonable, the chairs are comfy and the space is big. 

Come here and have battle for your seats. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious full bodied caffeinated liquid.mmm


What a treat from the holy land! If only I could drip their delicious brown liquid into my veins on a daily basis. Mmmm

Edit. Never mind. they wouldn't put sweetner in my latte for me!!???"}
{"text":"You should expect the same high quality from this aroma that you get at other ones. 

The only down side is seating space.  

Knowing that you're in a mall and likely carrying a ton of bags or bringing along children, the space can get cramped really fast. 

Aroma is less like a Starbucks and more like a super casual restaurant.  For the most part, I'm not just citing s drink and leaving. Usually we're ordering food (since it's so fresh and good) and need a place to sit down. 

Coffee is fantastic.  Sandwiches are already fresh.  Soups are never cold. I do wish they had more soup variety. 

This place is a must visit for a quick (healthyish) bite to eat in the mall.  

Oh and did I mention you get a free aroma chocolate with all your drink orders!"}
{"text":"I've always preferred going to a stand-alone restaurant over a food court. It is the same when it comes to Aroma Espresso Bar. I have avoided going to the one in the Urban Eatery at the Eaton Centre because I'd rather go to one of the cafes. However, with no Metropass and the lack of time to walk to other Aromas, I buckled down and went to the one at Urban Eatery.

Prior to this trip, I always got a personal sandwich and a drink from Aroma. I decided that I wanted more food and remembered the barista telling me that if I get the DoubleUp Combo, it would be $10 including tax. I thought that was a pretty good deal so I decided to go for the combo this time around. The DoubleUp Combo ($8.85) includes two choices of: soup or any personal sandwich or mixed greens/caesar salad/chopped salad/quinoa salad. I got the Philly Chicken sandwich and the Butternut Squash soup. They forgot my bread and butter for the soup when I received my meal. Since it was busy, I simply waited and told them they forgot my bread and it was resolved immediately.

Can I say, hands down, Aroma's Butternut Squash soup is my favourite soup ever. I've never had a favourite soup up until now. It was thick and creamy with the right amount of sweetness. The sandwich was tasty but soup totally overshadowed it in this meal.

Aroma Espresso Bar is popular with the working crowd during lunch time (as always). Being located in the Eaton Centre, it is accessible to those who work in the mall and anyone who has access to the Path. It has its own fenced off section in the food court, exclusive to those who order from Aroma. Overall, it is a good alternative if you are unable to run to the Bay and Dundas location (go to that one if you can!)."}
{"text":"By now, everyone should be familiar with Aroma Espresso Bar. This post will serve as another cafe marker on the imaginary Toronto cafe map I have going on (which is a great idea I might put together one day). However, as you may know, I like to try out new food every time I enter Aroma. One of my favourite items that I discovered at their Queen St. West location was their Italian Cheese Croissant. I highly recommend it because I actually think it's sorta better than their sandwiches! The cheese and vegetables in the slightly toasted croissant made a delicious combination.

Although this is not quite my favourite location (the undone floors makes it look unfinished), it's a convenient location for everyone along the Queen/Bathurst and Queen/Spadina areas."}
{"text":"I had an interview with a company by Yonge and Eglinton. As expected of Aroma Espresso Bar, they had a location right there. I decided to stop by for lunch after my interview.

At 11 AM, there was a crowd of people waiting to buy their lunch to go so they could make it back to their offices. Someone even ordered a platter of sandwiches! I decided to order another DoubleUp Combo ($8.85) which I chose a Turkey BLT sandwich and Red Lentil soup. I like trying something new every time I'm at Aroma to see if I can discover new favourites! After I ordered, I asked about the outlets since I needed a place to charge my phone. I thought it was neat that they had outlets under the long wooden tables by the windows. 

I received my order in a brown bag, even though I didn't ask for my meal to go. However, it provided itself useful when I decided to take my sandwich to eat later in the day. Red Lentil was the second soup I ever ordered from Aroma. I wanted to see if it matched up to the Butternut Squash, my favourite Aroma soup. After trying the Red Lentil, the Butternut Squash was indeed still my favourite. I didn't eat my Turkey BLT until a couple or so hours later, so it wasn't fresh by the time I ate it. I definitely recommend eating their sandwiches right away or at least re-heat it if you can.

This Aroma is right by the Yonge-Eglinton Centre so it's a great place to stop by after the movies or if you need a break from shopping!"}
{"text":"I came in wanting to try a cafe that allows students like me to have a space to study. I asked the barista what I should try and she was friendly. I was unimpressed though when I went to find a place to sit that many of the tables were left unclean. After observing, they don't clean down the tables too often. Maybe once every half hour and that turns me off because I want to sit wherever without the mess.

Coffee wise, I think the price is fantastic considering I have never tried anything asides the big-chain coffee shops. I really like the fact that they give complimentary chocolate with the order. 

Study-wise, I can do it. A little bit noisy and busy, but after awhile I got into my readings."}
{"text":"Meh, latte was alright.  I normally wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but was fiending for some good ol' caffeine and stopped in.  The inside of the place and the setup is beautiful, but the drinks were unimpressive. I didn't try any of the food here, so can't comment on that.

Price wasn't exactly cheap either."}
{"text":"I love the Aroma Special salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, hard boiled egg, olives plus choice of albacore tuna or feta cheese).  Today I asked for argula instead of mixed greens and 1/2 tuna and 1/2 feta.  This salad is healthy and so good.  It's very filling and decent deal at $8.25.  The lattes at Aroma are my favourite.  
."}
{"text":"On a Bloor block that's chockablock with coffee shops, Aroma rocks. 

OK, enough free styling. A few steps from Bathurst subway station, Aroma offers a unique coffee shop experience to an otherwise well-caffeinated section of the city. 

Sandwiches arrive on home-baked bread. The slices are long on area but short on depth, available in white, brown and multigrain.  They are politely filled with whatever you desire. Avocados are ripe, boiled egg slices are perfectly creamy, smoked salmon is still slightly chilly. There's a lot of pickled items nestled among the options, and combinations that you won't find at Tim Horton's; an interesting combination of western staples with a middle-eastern twist. Half-portions are available for a light lunch or solid snack. Even the small salads are big enough to share; loaded with fresh veggies and abundant protein. While I rarely crave salad, when the urge strikes, the Aroma salad with tuna and feta cheese gets the job done nicely. 

Desserts range from good to awesome. Alfajores combine everything good in the world except chocolate. Fresh, crumbly shortbread sandwiched around dulce de leche. A perfect end to a virtuous lunch, or over coffee if you're one of those people who can't order a cuppa without a little something on the side. Sugar-free baked goods are also available, making this a suitable place to take anyone who watches their carb intake. 

Coffee offerings vary from a straightforward cup of medium-strength joe, to fancy lattes, cappuccinos and mochas. A wee bit more expensive than Starbucks, their espresso blend is smoother and packs a less assertive punch with lower acidity. Good enough to drink without sugar, complimented by a free milk chocolate square. To those who would hate on a place that offers free chocolate, you have no soul. 

I'm a committed coffee drinker, but even I have to admit my preference for Aroma's non-coffee beverages. Hot chocolate is sweet but rich with real cocoa and dairy. Teas hot and iced blow the big chains out of the water. Mint tea, a proper cluster of vibrant leaves floating in the cup, and a green tea lemonade slush stops conversation cold. We sip in shock and awe. 

Ordering is different; you pay at the cash register, then claim your order once it's announced by the Barista over the house mic. I'd be lying if I didn't admit to making up names on occasion. I have yet to receive a Moe Szyzlak-worthy response. 

As an aside, I have noticed some trolling regarding this particular chain of cafes, regarding the country in which they are headquartered. I'm not sure how appropriate it is to make political statements in a restaurant review, but since the food system has itself become a bit of a policy hot-button, I shall indulge just this once. 

Aroma cafés are franchised. They are owned and operated by local business people. 

Targeting Aroma or any other local business for the sake of an  ill-informed, hateful campaign  because of the background of their corporate parents is like boycotting Mandarin over China's policies regarding Tibet

The current campaign is filled with misrepresentations regarding Israeli defence and human rights policy, and seeks to make a factually inaccurate comparison with other countries. It is intellectually fraudulent and morally bankrupt. Curiously, those who try to launch such ill-advised campaigns seldom show up to protest the actions of other governments against their own citizens, much less a sovereign country's attempt to defend itself against its hostile neighbours. 

Engaging in an informed discussion about Israeli (or any other government's) policy is entirely appropriate. Smearing local businesses because of their principals' religious, ethnic, or national background smacks of something else. Attempts to mask a political screed as a weak review speaks to the poster's lack of credibility. 

In any case, I know where I'm buying my next latte. Thanks, Junior."}
{"text":"We picked up an espresso and they gave us a free tiny chocolate with it. The espresso was very small and not bad tasting. The table in here are convenient but packed tightly. You can easily people watch from the sitting area here."}
{"text":"I really like this Aroma! The food and drinks are fresh and delicious! It is quiet and always has room for people to have a meeting or study compared to the coffee shops nearby. I have yet to try the full menu but I really like the Warm Chicken Salad and Dark Roast. It is my new favourite spot for studying!"}
{"text":"I was sort of disappointed with this coffee shop. I ordered a cappuccino and got a latte instead. The latte was fine. Delicious pain au chocolat though. Decor seems a bit sterile, too much of a big business feel for my taste."}
{"text":"I've had their desserts and thought they were pretty good but it wasn't until recently that I decided to try their food. The first time I had their breakfast hash and it was good. I was really happy to find somewhere with quick service and healthy options. That evening I got really sick and assumed it was from the dinner I ate the night before from wholefoods (end of the night hot food station assumed it could of been out all day). Today I decided to go there for lunch and order the aroma salad and a mango and kale smoothie. Because this is the only thing I've eaten all day (I worked late) I can say with certainty it is the cause of me currently living in my bathroom. Aside from the last time I ate there I can't remember the last time I got this sick after eating out. I'm honestly confused because I have no idea what it is exactly that made me sick but I know going forward i'll stick to the desserts. Don't get me wrong the food is good but it really not worth the aftermath."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars for me... definitely better than the average place and MILES better than the Sherway Aroma.

After my little disaster of a drink order at Sherway Aroma, I decided to give Aroma a final try before i casted off the entire brand.  I arrived early on Friday morning at Square One and needed a caffeine kick.  Sometime a bit sweet but not drenched in sugary overload.

I ordered a medium almond milk chai latte with a shot and they started immediately working on my drink.  The ordering was quick smooth plus it has tap ... convenient.  I got the latte quickly and it was filled up to the top and given a little small chocolate treat as part of your order.  Though it's not the best chocolate, the small offering is a nice touch over other places.  Compared to Sherway, this place was much friendly so bonus points to them!

My drink was nice and hot... and appropriately filled to about 85% of the cup!  NOT LIKE SHERWAY where they filled it to only 60%.  It had a better balance than the Sherway one too.  Though it is a touch sweet... the larger amount of almond milk allowed more of the spice to flavour the drink and less of the sugary syrup.

This place is clean with lots of tables and bright sun coming through.  It's a nice little spot and alternative to the food court Starbucks and Second Cup.  I'll have to try them again with a coffee drink.  For now, it's a solid option!"}
{"text":"Over the years I've gained an appreciation for Aroma and the food they serve. It's a much better alternative to Timmy's or Starbucks. I used to regard Aroma as a coffee place, I never really paid attention to their breakfast options or sandwiches. Now, I look forward to grabbing an occasional lunch at one of Aroma's locations. For a chain of cafes, the quality and variety of their food are top-notch IMHO. I'd recommend checking out their avocado sandwich + lentil soup combo.

In my subjective opinion, Aroma deserves 4 stars, especially considering that it's a chain as opposed to a one off location."}
{"text":"Freshness defined. Everything here is healthy and delicious. Great place to eat or just have a coffee"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out in a relatively quiet environment. They have a large seating space and with benches in the middle that can easily accommodate a group of 10-12 people, this place is a great for large groups as well. 

We tried their Cortado with Soy Milk and Ice Aroma Light (with Soy Milk). Cortado was really great- the second best I have had to date (still not compared to the best Cortado I have had in Kentucky US). Ice Aroma Light was okay. It was supposedly less sugar but it still tasted quite sugary. A good drink on a hot day though. 

Overall, it's a nice place to hang out with friends or even if you are on your own."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting an aroma, and I have to say I am a bit disappointed. I thought aroma was a bit more of an upscale coffee cafe, or maybe it was just the location, but when I pass by an aroma, it usually looks like a very quaint and charming place.

Upon entry the first thing I noticed was how grimey the place looked. The tables, the counter, the credit machine, the glass. Everything looked like it had not been wiped in a while. There were 2 staff working the front with no line, but I had to wait about 5 minutes before being served. I didn't mind too much since the cashier who took my order was polite.

I had the albacore tuna (half sandwich) and a coffee. Ran to a little over $8. I love that they announce your name when your order is ready, but even at $8 I didn't think what I got was worth it. I drank my coffee black, and honestly it tasted exactly like Tim Hortons dark roast. The sandwich was non-toasted on 2 floppy pieces of sour dough bread. It had onion, arugula, a pickle and what seemed to me like canned tuna. The sandwich was very average, and without the pickle I would say a complete waste of money. It was also a complete turnoff to see that the only tables available for seating were covered with dirty plates and trays.

Severely below standard food, dirty restaurant, and average customer service. For the price they charge, it's definitely a ripoff. You can make a better sandwich at home for half the price."}
{"text":"A nice little Aroma located in a cool neighborhood. I've come here a few times just to sit and enjoy a coffee and work a little bit. It's not the \"best\" aroma - some of them are really nice and clean and beautiful, but it is a welcoming one and the staff is friendly and it isn't overly noisy. The w-fi here is free and quite good as well."}
{"text":"Very small
Portion size for the sandwiches and salads. Coffee is good but for you want value for food, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"You got to love Aroma. You have to give props for this chain that managed to penetrate the coffee market in a city that seemed to be saturated with big corporate coffee. Their recipe for success is simple: they focus on quality, freshness and nice ambiance.

Their coffee is a significant step above the major chains (Second Cup, Starbucks and Coffee Time.) They also offer fresh items like fresh salads and nice sandwiches on freshly baked breads/croissants.  Some of my favourite items are:
- Turkish coffee - it's super fantastic
- Bureka (and also the \"Bureka Treat\")
- Aroma Power Breakfast - really nice and light breakfast
- Shakshuka

Their space is always inviting and clean."}
{"text":"Awesome place! 

Gluten Free bread available! 

I had the Gluten Free bread with the Pesto, tomatoes and goat cheese sandwich, it was the best! The gluten free bread tasted good and light. 

The coffee is always good here even the espresso. 

The place is clean and has an outdoor patio and the service is good and friendly. 

What else can you ask for? 

That's why I had to give them 5 stars, great job."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Avoid. I ordered their lentil soup and they cashed me out and everything only to tell me they were out AFTER I PAID. They gave me some mushroom soup which was disgusting. Avoid it it has a sweet after taste made me want to gag. I came another time and ordered an earl grey latte and was ridiculously disappointed because it tasted like water. Worst earl grey latte of my life. Just avoid all around"}
{"text":"Nice open space. Good coffee and sandwiches. Often long lines. Lines can be confusing (who's already ordered and who's waiting to order). A bit noisy. WiFi's pretty good. This is the kind of place I like when it's not busy."}
{"text":"I love this location! 
Super friendly staff, always keeping outside / inside super clean. cashier remembered that this was our third time visiting this week . 
My cappuccino is made on point @ this location. 
Will be visiting 2-3x a week 100%. 
Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"The service at this location is horrendous. The service is not good at all, whenever I come up to order, the cashiers always give attitude, make you feel like you're bothering them, and are never pleasant. On one of my visits in the past, I was sitting at a table and the worker there asked me to move to a different table so a larger party could sit there. I've been to many restaurants and I've never been asked to move to a different table to accommodate someone else. 
Also, this location closes at 10:00PM on Thursdays, today however, at 9:15PM they decided to lock one of the entrances. At 9:25PM they shut off all of the lights in the restaurant, and at 9:30PM, the employee asked me to leave even though this location closes at 10:00PM. I asked her what time this location closes and she said 10:00PM, but they wanted to close early since there are not very many customers left. I found this very unprofessional, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Aroma was directly next door to where we were staying for the weekend, so I popped in here for breakfast, and again later on for espresso...

The breakfast options all sounded good, but I settled for a sweet potato hash because I'm a sucker for sweet potato. The hash itself was decent, cooked with some mushrooms and other veggies. The portion was a bit small for the price, however. The hash was served next to a piece of bread, topped with a sunnyside up egg. The disappointing part, however, was that the bread was sitting on top of a mound of mayo. It wasn't written on the menu, and I very much dislike mayo, but the either way the trouble was that I wanted to pick up the bread to eat it, but it was covered in mayo & consequently soggy. Eating bread with a fork and knife is very unappealing to me... I like to eat like a savage with my hands. Maybe that's strange, but I love me some sandwiches.

When I came back in the afternoon for espresso, my experience was a bit better. We ordered the \"affogato\", which is a shot of espresso topped with a scoop of vanilla gelato. It was DELICIOUS.  I don't love espresso on it's own, it's a bit too bitter for me, but paired with the gelato, it was the perfect combination of bitter and smooth. I'd come back for the affogato, but not for the food."}
{"text":"I came here after work and I ordered an iced Brazilian hazelnut latte and I noticed that the service was a bit iffy, the lady who was making my drink did not look like her day was going well but other than that, the drink was not bad, it also took awhile to make as there was a person infront of me in line. This place has a great amount of seating, good for studying and hanging out."}
{"text":"Recently I've become obsessed with patios. I love the fact that they have a lot of tables outside. I tried the house blend and it is comparable to other branded coffee shops. Reliable wifi, and great and outstanding customer service.. I also think the little complementary chocolate deserves a star."}
{"text":"I always get the grilled chicken sandwich or the warm chicken salad with a chai latte or iced aroma and it never disappoints. Pastries and food are fresh. Great drinks. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Most of the Aroma locations I have been to, including this one, had a less pretentious and more cozy and group-oriented atmosphere than your typical Starbucks or Second Cups. With little effort I once managed to fit a group of 8 very loud Persians at this location. 

Their coffee menu is pretty standard with Turkish coffee, orchid latte and the affogato (espresso with a scoop of ice cream) being the novelties. Their breakfast menu is overpriced and uninteresting. They have one item, which briefly piqued my interest, and that was the Shakshouka. It was essentially eggs served on top of a warm salsa-like soup served with a side of Tahini."}
{"text":"Mediocre and formulaic. The drinks seem to be manufactured and very artificial. Their food is bland and generic. There are much better options out there."}
{"text":"I, unlike most, came here just for a caffeine fix and haven't yet tried any of Aroma's food offerings. I had wanted to try Aroma's coffee for quite some time, and serendipitously the opportunity arose when my go-to for coffee in Liberty Village - Balzac's - posted a sign on their door saying that their espresso machine was broken. Blasphemy! Unwilling to settle for a brewed coffee when I desperately wanted a latte, I sauntered over to Aroma and ordered just that. Unfortunately, I found my latte extremely milky and the espresso lacking in flavour, but the staff were quite friendly and Aroma seems like a nice enough place to come for lunch or catching up with a friend. 

Bonus points for barista benevolence: much to my chagrin, my clumsy coffee companion immediately dropped his iced Americano as soon as he walked out the door, and the barista was kind enough to make him a new one (and give him another chocolate!) free of charge. He thought his Americano was delicious."}
{"text":"The prices are really good for the portion size and they warmed up my almond croissant which made it even more tasty! I like that they give you a small piece of chocolate."}
{"text":"Hands down best latte in the city and the little chocolates they give you on the side are just the thing on a cold and dreary day. It's to bad this place is always packed... I can never find a seat :-("}
{"text":"Nothing too special about the food. It is fresh and tasty. Drinks are overpriced. But, in this area, the only place for a work lunch."}
{"text":"We go to a lot of Starbucks and cafés and this one definitely has unique drinks, especially on the cold side.

They've got an upstairs which is pretty nice, only downside is a couple times I've been here, they haven't cleaned the tables and we've had to clear them off ourselves.

The biggest and really only major problem is their wifi. It is awful. You can't connect ever. Even if there's no one here. Which is a problem for us, because we bring our laptops.

Today I tried the bone broth drink and it is extremely tasty. Worth a star, it's that good!!"}
{"text":"My favourite place on campus for a quick lunch and coffee. I usually order the quinoa salad and a soy latte, and have never experienced any issues here! 

The restaurant is always clean, the food is always fresh, and the service has always been stellar. Will probably be frequenting Aroma on Bay for the next few years."}
{"text":"Lots of healthy options for lunch. I had the avocado sandwich and quinoa salad (super foods!). I expected freshly sliced avocados, but turns out it's an avocado spread, likely made earlier in the day. Texture was a bit mushy. The quinoa salad was fairly basic. Overall a good healthy option but perhaps a bit pricey for $10... The restaurant itself is very clean, modern, and service is quite quick. Saw they had a Halloumi cheese sandwich that i would like to try one day (I love Halloumi cheese and don't often spot it on menus!)"}
{"text":"The chickpea salad has more croutons than chickpeas. This is the third such experience. This was not the case until very recently. I hope this trend does not continue."}
{"text":"Nice patio, good cappuccino and great little chocolate treats. I like that the biscotti was  inexpensive (sub $2.00)"}
{"text":"I've
Been. An aroma customer for Over 5 years. for 2 years I lived next to the annex location and stopped there each morning for a boiled egg and espresso. 

The food is always good, clean and healthy. Service good. Decor and seating I've always enjoyed. However, wifi is Always shoddy (regardless of location) and very hard to find power outlets making this just a place for a quick bite or a coffee. which is sad because its a great place to linger for a few hours, get work done, and spend an over-average amount of money at. sad they havent figured that out.

Highlights: Salads. Either quinao, freekeh or chickpea all very tasty and well priced. 
Sandwiches: Burrekah treat, is rather awesome, while you'll struggle to get past half the sandwich, it makes for a great meal (and great leftovers)

anything not mentioned in highlights is in my opinion, a lowlight: regular sandwiches= not bad, they have pretty good fluffy bread but its so big relative to the filling i find it underwhelming. breakfast is just OK, dont try the shakshuka its not that good (sadly)."}
{"text":"I love the set up of Aroma Expresso Bar. 

Those nice booth sofa seating not only good to sit with your friends and sipping coffee but great for reading a book (that's what I did) But the only thing is you won't have the view of the TV.

The coffee here is A-OK. Strong roast and love the chocolate on the side. If they would have change that to 50% dark chocolate. Love the mug, thick and heavy.

BTW, that guy Wayne saw in June, was still there on his Apple Laptop the hour I were there with his serious face... maybe he is reading Yelper's review of his competitors??

The late hours makes Aroma Espresso a great choice to hang out late if you have no where to go with your friends or after having wings or fro yo across the plaza."}
{"text":"I love that Aroma Espresso Bar opens up a location in Vaughan Mills. And I usually prefers Aroma espresso drinks over Starbucks instead especially withe the complimentary piece of chocolate.

The Single Shot Macchiato was OK and so is that chocolate. There is also extra seating right outside the shop if the inside get crowded.

Maybe just the lack of enthusiastic vibe of the staff just gave me a so so impression? Maybe they should be drinking more a shot or 2 before each shift might have help? 

Probably will be back as there are not too many option inside Vaughan Mills for a coffee break."}
{"text":"Aroma Espresso Bar inside Fairview Mall has a different setup than most of the other Aroma I been to. I do like how it is in the middle of the hallway right underneath the skylight, a great place to people watch while enjoying a cup of coffee.

The Espresso Macchiato I ordered was A-OK. But of course, I was a little more excited to pair it with the piece of chocolate that came complimentary with my drink.

Aroma is probably the best option inside Fairview Mall if you want a decent espresso drink serves in a proper cup even with a latte art. The other option which is Second Cup, is not even close to what Aroma can offer!"}
{"text":"Huge room for improvement both on drink quality and service.

Having another Aroma Espresso Bar in Markham is definitely exciting. Being relatively new, there were so many things went wrong during my visit.

I have been to quite a few Aroma in GTA and pretty familiar with the menu and set up. So I was quite disappointed with this location.

I ordered a London Fog to stay. The cashier did not take my name, I guess since the cafe was not busy. So while I patiently waited for my drink to be ready, and after 10 minute I went to the counter to check. Apparently, it was sitting on the counter and no one even bother to let me know.

Nothing was provided to stir my drink. When I asked at the front, the barista held me a long plastic spoon. Huh?

People here were all busy greeting their friends when they walked in. I feel just so unwelcome as a paying customer."}
{"text":"Aroma Espresso Bar is such a pleasant surprise! 

I did not realized that there are so much seatings at the back of the shop! We have no problem securing a table where we sipped on coffee and enjoyed some girly talk on this Sunday evening! 

Both our Mocha Coffee and Cappuccino was nicely prepared and of course love that chocolate and the heavy mugs they were served in! 

Free Wifi is great idea, it can be a curse for some if all they want is to have a coffee and relax, not trying to find seats where people are parking themselves for hours with their laptops. Aroma Espresso Bar seems to solve this problem with hardly any outlets to juice up your laptops... so did limit those extended hours long stay! 

Service here is nice and friendly. Coffee is great. Plentiful Seatings.. I for sure will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Give me Aroma over Starbucks any day. Even though there's one across the street.

Not just because they give you a little square of chocolate with your drink (they do), not because their coffee is delicious (it is), not because the place is just so much prettier than Starbucks (also true)...I love Aroma for their tea. LOVE. I absolutely hate when I order tea and it's a tea bag that I could buy myself. I appreciate real herbs, real tea leaves that might be a little bit more difficult for me to prepare at home.

Which is why I love their Mint tea. Mmmmm.

I also adore their frozen coffees in the summer. It's an awesome summer drink with no frills -- Coffee, Ice, Milk. And I think that's exactly how it should be."}
{"text":"Favorite place to hang out with friends or write my assignment. Love the cappuccino & croissant combo (5/6 dollars) super delicious!"}
{"text":"nice coffee shop. the blend coffee is good and I love the decor here, clean and simple"}
{"text":"Love the staff, love the food, love the atmosphere... The owners are super nice guys, and very friendly.

I don't think I've actually had, what I would classify as, a bad experience in the DOZENS upon DOZENS of times I have visited this location since it opened.

P.S. I've ordered more than half the menu :)"}
{"text":"Good food but the service is very poor. Staff isn't friendly/borderline rude. This is too bad as I really enjoyed their coffee and menu options. The combination of slow service and unfriendly staff is what will keep me away. I would only drop by to quickly pick up a coffee if I was desperate for caffeine."}
{"text":"Good coffee which explains the lines. Place was a mad house. 
Girl asked my husband which bread but then said they were out of whole wheat, so what other bread would he like? I asked, which breads do they have? Only white or multigrain currently. Wouldn't you start with that info? 
She was also prioritizing sweeping behind the counter over attending to customers. At that point there were 10 ppl behind us. Strange priorities. 
I came the next day though for coffee again. I like that they serve it was a small square of chocolate. The drip coffee is really good."}
{"text":"Their coffee though...excellent.
I had the cappuccino here and having a sweet foam is a good sign when it comes to barista's technique. 

I have to get rid of one star because every time we go there the tables are not cleared out as often and quick enough."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to these type of places, but my friend was moving away to another country, and we decided to celebrate here.  I like the casual and relaxed atmosphere of the place, and how it's situated right at the entrance.  Even though it's the first thing you see from the outside, from the inside it looks more hidden, so it provides a little \"hideaway\" feel, which is quite nice.  I've since eaten here twice, and have ordered something different each time, and I can conclude that I like their food.  It's simple yet flavourful.  I wish the portions were bigger, but then again, I don't have a normal appetite.  Service is a little slow, but it's not gonna stop me from coming back.  I had the philly steak sandwich.  It was savoury, and it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. I ate breakfast and lunch here several days. The food was always healthy, fresh, and served quickly. You don't find all three of those in a place very often! The staff is also very helpful and friendly. In fact, the last time I went in I mentioned that I'd be leaving in the morning and they gave me a small discount as my \"going away\" gift! Never had that before."}
{"text":"Dont go to this location if you want a proper iced cappucino. The service was slow and guy seemed like he couldnt care less. The manager needs to do a much better job at hiring people."}
{"text":"Visit regularly. Service is good.Food is standard aroma stuff. Great location, right at yonge and eg."}
{"text":"This is a must for me every time I visit Toronto! Coffee and food is consistently great and it's a good place to sit down for work. My only complaint is my butternut squash soup came out luke warm."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a few times as its it square one mall and convenient when you're shopping. The iced aroma is by far my favourite drink, it's not too sweet or bitter. I love that you get a small piece of chocolate with each purchase, it's a nice touch. The patio area is great when it's sunny but the foot traffic nearby is quite busy. The staff are friendly and always greet you with a smile, it seems like they enjoy working there. All in all its a nice shop but it's best to go when it's not peak mall hours, as it gets quite crowded."}
{"text":"Great food,  so, so coffee- unfortunately they will not take legal tender as payment-  so keep that in mind if you want to visit...  or bring $5.00 bills-  good thing there is a Starbucks right across the street."}
{"text":"What's that pistachio latte?!? sooo good!!! 
The cup is so cute , and they give you a piece of chocolate to indulge it with you drink. (Gotta love attention to details)
Im sad to not have one location around where I live!! 
While in Toronto for 3 days, I had about 4 of those pistachio lattes!!

Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My now-stable blood sugar demanded I pen this review instantly: Aroma allows for half-orders.  Headline reads: LIFE SAVED, AROMA WINS HUMANITARIAN AWARD WITH 50% SAMMICH!

1/2 a (delicious, note) haloumi sandwich has saved my late afternoon sugar levels from crashing on more than one occasion.  It's a tasty way to safeguard against passing out, while simultaneously not tipping off to your dinner companion that you ate a second lunch.

While I'm here, I'll throw out: great breakfasts (I'm more of a savoury gal, so eggs + salad = most important meal of the day, indeed).  Come summertime, the Aroma lite [sic] blended drink tastes like hint-of-coffee melted-down softserve (that's a great thing).

Yelp note: due to UofT proximity and free wifi, this location can get crazybusy with students.  In the winter months especially, when things can't spill out onto the patio, it can be tough to wrangle a seat.  To counter that frustration, just focus on the fact that your order comes with a cute Aroma-wrapped chocolate!"}
{"text":"I always brace myself when places ask for my name, as my double-vee'd handle frequently reduces (white) people to incoherent mutters and near-epileptic spasms. So it was a pleasant surprise when Aroma only moderately butchered my name when taking my order. Kudos.

Aroma is an mod corner coffeeshop in the Annex, that's bathed in vermillion and black and mirrors. The friendly service here lacks the hipster-than-thou attitude found in so many of Toronto's independent cafés, and guess what: the coffee is just as good. My espresso was smooth and delicious, and I really dug my croissant.

There is plenty of seating, free wifi (password is printed on the receipt), a spacious patio (that is happenin' in the summer) and odd fireplace \"thingy\" that I'm sure will prove handy come winter. This place is usually bustling though, so good luck finding a seat.

Obligatory Title Pun: All roads lead to AROMA.

Menu Readability: It was readable, yo.

Need to mention: Every order comes with a cute piece of chocolate.

What this place teaches me about myself: Sometimes I wish my name was as easy as \"Bob.\" (But hardly ever, really.)"}
{"text":"Horrible coffee bar Do not bother going there. This place is a rip off and the food does not taste good at all. I Have no clue why they have any customers"}
{"text":"I stopped into this Aroma location with a friend before a movie at the nearby Cineplex. I ordered an iced mocha but, upon learning Aroma doesn't offer this, the barista suggested I get the Ice Aroma. This is a blended ice drink with espresso and a little chocolate. Not too sweet which I like, but very rich and creamy. By the time I was finished I no longer had any room for the movie popcorn I had planned on getting. Probably for the best, really. My friend ordered the Ice Aroma Light and felt way less full. Something to consider for my next visit I suppose.

This location has a nice patio with lots of seating and shade and even a little water fountain wall. But, being located right at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton, its charm is diminished by the ongoing (never ending?) construction happening at this intersection."}
{"text":"My friend suggested that I try the hot chocolate here because it's good and boy, was she right! I got the hot chocolate with milk chocolate bits + marshmallows. It was made well, and I will def. get it again if I come back to the mall, however, without the marshmallows.

Only issue would be that the marshmallows were huge!! It would make more sense for them to add smaller ones so it would be easier to drink.

P.s. they give you free chocolate with every purchase!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their hot chocolates and sandwiches.

What I don't love is customer service and I do understand not all employees are 'rude' however that is what I have experienced in that location.

I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for some  beverages after dinner. I got the  lemon-mint iced beverage, and my friend  got a mocha. 
Ambiance is comfortable 
If there is one item that must be tried it is the lemon-mint drink. It is unique and tastes great and I recommend everyone should try  it. 
The lack of plug points is a big  negative for me because  while free  WiFis great, ,not having a plug point from which to  charge our electronic devices from which we access the internet does not help much at all. 
The product range  is good , but for the best bang for your buck, go with items that  are unique to the dining experience and cannot be got at home .
The complimentary chocolate with  the purchase of a beverage is a nice gesture by the company. 
I will return to  an aroma near me  in the future to try different products
Customer Service by the cashiers was  really good."}
{"text":"It is difficult finding a seat at this cafe, even at 2pm on a Monday afternoon.

I came here to enjoy a coffee and do some work, since I heard there was free wifi. I was not disappointed with the wifi. Were there power outlets? I found one, but the seat was occupied and I didn't want to walk around a crowded cafe looking for one. So I sat at my table until my name was called. I picked up the mocha, sat back down, and enjoyed the free wifi. When I first drank the mocha, I thought the coffee was a little strong, and really couldn't taste the hot chocolate part. To my surprise, I didn't realize that there was a chunk of chocolate inside the bottom of the cup until I was near the end. I prefer that the barista mix it in for me, since I can't see through the coffee in the cup. It's not intuitive. What was left of the mocha and melted chocolate was too sweet, but I bet I would have enjoyed it if it was mixed properly before I reached the bottom."}
{"text":"Was there last week and what a negative experience. Entered the store and no employee was to be seen. Waited for a couple of more minutes then went behind the counter to the kitchen to see if someone could help me

He shouted at me that I should not be behind the counter. Stubbornly I waited a little longer and finally some one came out to take my ice coffee order. 

FYI the iced coffee here was 50% more expensive than Starbucks and certainly no better. 

To add insult to injury the manager than came out, not to offer me a coffee complimentary for the abysmal service but to once again warn me not to go behind the counter when I can't find an employee. 

Not to worry. I won't."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago to get some studying done in the evening. I had some anxiety, expecting it to be super busy like every other Aroma I've been too but when I got there it actually wasn't. In fact, the atmosphere was perfect. Nice and chill with good coffee. I had a great time. 

I sat around the corner in the back (kind of a vague description, but you'll know what I mean once you go inside) and it was a great location to get some studying done because it was away from the doors and the traffic of people. I ordered a latte, and damn it was good. I love how they always give you a chocolate with your coffee. It just makes it so much better. I also like how they give little plates with your drink, so that coffee doesn't get on the table you're working on and then onto your books/laptop.

Over all, I really like this place. The only thing is that there is only a single washroom. It's a nice washroom, but waiting sucks. Especially after you've downed a whole coffee and the person in there is taking forever #truestory #funtimes

Still, highly recommend this place. I would definitely go again if I find myself in that area."}
{"text":"I've been to Aroma only twice so far but the coffee I ordered was absolutely delicious both times. I tried their latte and their white mocha latte and both were really good. This is coming from a true coffee lover (i.e. I don't believe Tim Hortons is real coffee).  My gf got a chai latte and just wow, it was actually the best chai latte I've ever had. They top it with cinnamon. . . Drool-worthy combination. The coffee lattes they top with chocolate as well, so also amazing but I'm going to have to admit that my gf had the better choice. I highly recommend trying their chai lattes. 

As far as the place itself, it looks nice inside. A little tight so maybe not ideal for say doing homework but would be a great place to relax and meet up with a friend or check your emails on your tablet/phones. Red seems to be their theme colour which is the opposite of Starbucks' trademark green colour. 

Hmmmm do I sense a direct rivalry? It will definitely be a good battle between them for my money 

This is a great place to come if you want quality coffee. I can tell I will be coming here again"}
{"text":"I see why this place has horrible reviews. What a joke in service and the breakfast sandwiches are a horrible I honestly they think that would be acceptable to serve. I asked for my money back and walked out."}
{"text":"I love Aroma in general and this location is great! The staff are always friendly, and the place is clean with a great little patio. 
I've never had food from here that I don't like. Everything is fresh and made to order. 
Aroma is healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"The coffee is AMAZING!!!! the hot chocolate is literally a melted chocolate bar in hot milk....yum! The salads are great...most stuff is a bit pricey.   They recently got a new manager who is way better than the previous one..and more hands on, but  for some reason, the service seems to be intermittently slow, and the staff disorganized.   There are times when there are very few people waiting for meals, and ours seems to take forever...other times not. The patio in the summer is awesome!.  They don't clean the tables that often, but if you ask them they will clean it for you.  It's a fight to get the tables in the sun...but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The pastries and drinks were decent, same as any Aroma location. I ordered the Aroma Coffee and I didn't even realize there was chocolate until I got to the bottom of my cup and there were thick globs. I think the barista forgot to stir it or should have at least told me to stir it myself. They forgot to give us our pastries with the drinks so I had to go up to the bar and remind them of our order, and then they forgot to put my cookie on the tray so I had to go up to the baristas and ask again (chocolate chip cookie is hard and gross btw, do not recommend)!
Also, not sure if it's only something you get with to-go orders but we never received the little chocolates that come with the order. 
Service wasn't bad, just VERY forgetful."}
{"text":"A good alternative to other chain coffee houses. Their coffee was pretty good and their food selection was better than the green mermaid joint across the street. Service was average and the seating was adequate for a fast-service breakfast-style restaurant. I'd probably be a regular if I lived and worked in Toronto"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. Aroma Salad and the Power Breakfast are awesome! Really nice looking place.  The iced coffees are really tasty (iced aroma i think) I would recommend this place. -----------------------------------------------"}
{"text":"OK, reality check. 

Pain au chocolat should never, ever be filled with Nutella. And at Aroma, it is. I ordered the chocolate croissant and while the pastry part was sufficiently flaky and buttery, the filling (typically solid, slightly melty chocolate - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_au_chocolat) oozed out like one of those rude cherry blossoms that nobody in their right mind would ever buy. 

Nothing wrong with Nutella, but it has no place in a chocolate croissant. A shameful offering."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we visit this location for their free smoothie promotion and there was a very long line. After ordering the mango and kale smoothie, we waited roughly 10 minutes or so. The smoothie came underfilled like many other smoothies we saw as the other orders from a range of people. Then after consuming this smoothie, only thing I ate in 2 hours, I had a horrible stomachache and was beside the bathroom for the next two hours. 

The decor was very chic and open concept! The chairs are comfy and there is free wifi. Nonetheless I would be eerie on their smoothies! Maybe wise to avoid anything 'free'."}
{"text":"They have to make your food fast, but that's not the kind of restaurant Aroma intended to be. While I do have a quarrel with Aroma as a business in itself, this particular one will skimp out on ingredients that you pay OH SO MUCH FOR and will never, ever, remember a specification on an order (eg. sauce preference). Go when it's slow, however that's a risk too, as the ingredients may not be prime."}
{"text":"Asked what are these?   There were many fresh unlabelled juices. \"Um..juice?\" Said the rude service? Person.  Can u tell me what kind, i asked.  Was rude and bitter.   I felt nervous about placing an order that would take time away from her lipstick application.  
When she angrily stated in a loud tone that my pin didnt go through, confused, i began to reenter my card and pin.  She sarcastically says\" did u NOT see approved when u punched it in??!\"   I was in shock by her boldness and unnecessary rude words.   U couldnt pay me to have a 4.50 lemonade again."}
{"text":"I'm not really a sandwich person but like most things, there are exceptions. 

To me, sandwiches are boring but I do like a good philly steak sandwich from time to time. Where can you go to get a good philly steak sandwich though? (Certainly not Charley's Philly Steaks - they're BLAND!) Well, I tripped across the ones at Aroma and they are good - especially if you substitute a croissant rather than the regular *yawn* bread.

Would I go out of my way to seek this out? No, but if you're shopping in the neighbourhood and get hungry, this hits the spot."}
{"text":"I asked a question and the lady seemed annoyed and even if it wasn't too busy she rushed me and gave me the \"just shut up and order\" look. Again I asked only one question wether the soup came as a set with sandwich..."}
{"text":"* Love the ambiance! 
* Perfect for quiet, sit down time and enjoy espresso. 
* Located at the mall but not inside where it can be crowded. Just perfect! 
* Perfect for after shopping cool down or simply taking a break in between shopping. 
* Ample open space parking across."}
{"text":"Ok I like aroma for their coffee and their options of almond or soy milk...they also have a vegan brownie that they offer but what really caught my eye was a vegan blueberry, peach crumble! 
We stopped by on the way home and I picked up a crumble. I left it in the fridge and went and had it the next day. I threw it in the microwave and omg sooooo good!! I love that I can pick up a vegan dessert close to home and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg! 
This location is generally busy but has a really cute outdoor patio! The only reason it isn't a 5 star rating is because sometimes the staff are a little unfriendly."}
{"text":"I didn't really
Like my lunch experience here. The bread is so weird. Like the crust is harder than a rock and the inside is so soft. When you cut off the crust you are left with such little bread. 
Also it would be nice if they had a vegan sandwich (vegan cheese perhaps??!). I do like that they have some very tiny vegan options (the lentil soup is amazing) but they definitely need more. Also the avocado toast had a fried egg on it...like why?! Lol
Anyways aroma is good for a quick but pricey lunch. Their coffee is decent and the service is okay."}
{"text":"Normally, Aroma overlooks Yonge and Eglington Square with a patio during warmer months.  These days it is hurt by the massive renovations that are being undertaken and is completely enclosed.  The renovations will carry on for at least another year.

They do sandwiches exceptionally well, I particularly like the smoke salmon and avocado sandwiches.  The breads are always very fresh, as are the ingredients.  My favorite indulgence is the Bureka Treat; a triangle shaped Bulgarian pastry, made from phyllo dough, stuffed with feta, pickles, tahini and topped with sesame seeds. I can't imagine the calories in it so only have it on occasion but it is fantastic. The Chai Tea is also a lot better than other coffee shops.  Be aware that the quality does come at an elevated price relative to similar options served elsewhere. 

I use this locations quite frequently for meetings as there is quite a bit of space and they never rush you.  The free wifi is also helpful."}
{"text":"I like Aroma, for a large coffee chain it's not bad and usually consistent. This location is terrible. Food is regularly sub par, orders are made wrong often. The coffee is decent but only order food it it isn't busy and the server looks over 25 and isn't completely stoned, which is rare at this spot. Otherwise hope you brought a good book as the wait will warrant  it. Seats aren't wiped down,  u tables are left dirty for 30 min durations. Last breakfast sandwich was terrible, came out cold and the Americano was just a cup of coffee. Way to screw up my order yet again Aroma. Get your act together you're making long lines and burnt java at Starbucks look good again. I would have asked for a refund but the line was too long, better to just share the post and move on."}
{"text":"Love the selection of breakfast and lunch options for the health conscious foodie. They also have soy, almond, lactose free milk options for the coffee lover. My new favorite drink is the Orchid latte. Light floral aroma, with coconut shavings, walnuts and a healthy dose of cinnamon on top! Almost filling enough to be a meal on its own. It's a fairly dense drink but so delicious - been getting it everything I've been here. They also serve some pastries and desserts, like mini chocolate and red velvet cupcakes to satisfy any sweet tooth (like mine)! All drinks are served with a peice of aroma chocolate.  How can you go wrong!"}
{"text":"Aroma still remains the best coffee shop in that part of the Annex. It's delicious, has great food options, and a vibe that you simply don't find elsewhere.

They expanded it a bit and added a huge mirror to one wall, so it looks gigantic but also slightly confusing. Don't walk into the mirror. (Just sayin'.)

There are always missed connections posted on Craigslist for this place. Maybe you'll go and fall in love twice in one night."}
{"text":"We are emotionally distressed that we have to leave this place here as we travel back home after a week of deliciousness. This gorgeous smiley gal was at the counter and had the best customer service abilities. We came in 4 times because the food was THAT GOOD. She was there 3 of them! She clearly works hard and really knows how to do her job. Overall, this place deserves more than 5/5 because of the quality of their food and beverages, service, and the number of options for different diets."}
{"text":"Fresh sandwiches, unique espresso beverages, delicious pastries. Great place for breakfast, lunch or a coffee break. Try the breakfast sandwich, Mediterranean sandwich, and mocha coffee (with real praline chocolate! )"}
{"text":"Fresh food, lots of vegan and vegetarian options, unique lattes and hot drinks including mint tea with real mint, hot chocolate with a chocolate praline, and a pistachio latte. Fresh sandwiches and salads incl mozzarella sandwich, Mediterranean sandwich and breakfast sandwich. A must!"}
{"text":"Favolosa!
I was here for the first time back in 2008 when I was a foreign student. I became a regular there as I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, food and drink. Last year I was visiting Toronto again. This time with the love of my life whom I get to call him my husband. I took him to the place and also invited some friends of mine who I used to hang out with 7 years ago in Toronto. We all had a good time catching up with drinks and some food. My husband and I wish there were Aroma espresso bar in the states also."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are horrible. Half a sandwich is 6 dollars before tax. Avoid this place, so that hopefully management will improve as Vaughan mills needs a social spot like this."}
{"text":"This Aroma location is really warm, welcoming and has a solid free wifi connection. Three of the most important things when looking for a place to spend a winter afternoon. 

They don't have the best tea selection, which is normally my thing, but even a bad green tea bag with some hot water and honey is still one of the most flawless concoctions of all time. So I'm not really that annoyed about their simple approach to the world's most popular beverage. 

Their sandwich selection is good, and a half is plenty. They put a bit of mustard in their egg salad, which is really zesty and fun. Just like me. 

WHO THE HELL IS PEPPER?"}
{"text":"I hate to beat up on any caffeine depots with wifi, but at second glance this place is worse than I thought. 

I ordered the mint tea and it was a salad of mint leaves floating in warm water and their wifi isn't working more than it is working. 

I heart the booths at the back, but there aren't ant outlets, making the whole situation a fleeting romance. 

The wooo-oooorst! (Sung like Jean Ralpheo from Parks and Rec.)"}
{"text":"Very helpful and friendly staff. Can't go wrong with their food and beverages, so good!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. The staff are amazing, and I was served right away. It was the perfect afternoon pick me up!"}
{"text":"Good place to sit and catch up with a friend while people watching"}
{"text":"We went there about a month ago and got some croissants (amazingly good) and coffee (good) to go.  Then last night, about 20 minutes to closing, we went in for late, late dinner.  Owning a cafe mysef I felt a little guilty going in so late.  If they were annoyed, the surely did not let on.  They were fun and courteous and fast.  My husband got a tuna salad half sandwhich and I had an avocado sandwhich, sans the hard boiled egg.  Both on multigrain bread.  My husband liked his sandwhich as I did mine.  What would have made it better would have been if the bread had been toasted but even cold it was good bread.  The size was *huge* and I thought maybe I would've been better off with half as well but in the end ate it all, of course (yes, I'm a pig).
About 2 minutes before closing a couple came in and started looking at the menu.  They were still looking when it was announced that the kitchen was now closed.  Their order was taken and when they (the couple) expressed concerns about being in the way the employees assured them that it was no problem.  I was very impressed by their professionalism.
I'll definitely be back.  I think I'll grab myself another avocado sandwhich and some more coffee on my way out of Toronto tomorrow."}
{"text":"BUSY.. came here at 6 or maybe 7? It was full, but luckily we got a table! It was my first time to Aroma (this was a year ago), but I've loved the concept and remained a fan since :)

On that evening though (a year ago), the tables were hardly cleaned... crumbs and empty cups were still there, plus the wrapper of Aroma chocolates. My friend put all of that away for me, thank you thank you. 

I've always loved Aroma for serving my cappuccino in their adorable mugs. Their pastries look delicious too. Quick service. Great atmosphere. So 5 stars for them.

Aside from that... this location... was really busy and had diiiirrrrty tables :(

Again, 5 stars for Aroma! but 3 stars for the ewwww table!!!! I didn't come back to this location since that one time, as I live pretty far."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and the service here.  I have never been disappointed with either.  What I do not like is the prices, they are far too high.  A coffee and a sandwich will run you $13.  At least that's what I paid today.  I bled a little inside when I paid the cashier.  That is craziness.  Its not like they sprinkled gold flakes on my plate and massaged my feet while I ate (although both would be cool). 

I enjoy eating here, but due to high prices only occasionally."}
{"text":"Even though they do not have plugs for computers, I still give it five stars and here is why: 

- my favorite decor. It looks like the Elephant-era White Stripes opened a coffee shop
- the chocolate that comes with the coffee is a nice touch
- they had free wi-fi while everyone else still made you give a credit card
- There's dudes there now, but there was once a time when it seemed like only cute girls were allowed to work there
- the chicken salad is expensive but worth every penny"}
{"text":"The food was great, the coffee was great. The service needed some work and it would start from the manager down. She wasn't pleasant or helpful. The other crew did what they could. 
Again, the star of the experience was the coffee and food both of which were great."}
