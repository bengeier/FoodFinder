{"text":"The oysters and scallops where good but not $17 good.  This place is way over priced. If you come here be sure to check the prices before you order and ask if it's extra if you add scallops to to your meal.   Fired oysters and scallops over $17 here.  This will be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"This location is closer to home than the original on Linwood Road and I really like the food here.  The staff is very friendly and I love the fact you get a salad with your meal.  I love the oysters, Canadian skinless flounder and the marinated beef strips - those are some of my favorites.  Their tartar sauce is excellent and yes you get to squirt it out of the container versus paying for individual cups like some places.  If you love seafood like I do give it a try.  Remember .....  good seafood isn't cheap and cheap seafood isn't good!"}
{"text":"Went to Captains Cap quite by accident, Monday night and the place we were heading to was closed... Drove out from Charlotte, hmmm this one is OPEN, so it gets a star for just being there!  We were after \"fish camp\" food, especially fried catfish.  captain cap does it the way my husband likes it.. Several small fried catfish, actually six on the senior plate... That's a lot of food!
Salad is saved by the fantastic sour slaw.. Waitress said go ahead and get seconds, and I did!
Broiled shrimp is pretty good, not fantastic, but lots of it... The sweet potato was somehow the sweetest baked sweet potato I've ever had...
Overall, good traditional fish camp food, and friendly service, and open on Monday night!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent seafood for the price. Salad bar could be improved since it's kind of basic but the stuffed shrimp are very good. They have a few all you can eat items that I saw many people order and it looked and smelled great. Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local seafood restaurant on a business trip and this was suggested. It's clean, the staff is very polite, service was quick and the food servings are generous.
Their crab cake appetizers come with three of them and they are large. They could almost be an entree on their own! The sauce they serve with it complements it nicely.
I ordered without asking how large the Captains Sampler Platter was - it was huge. Flouder, green shrimp, stuffed oyster, hush puppies, and choice of potato. I could barely finish half! The food was all satisfactory. It wasn't bad at all, but nothing really stood out either aside from the portion sizes.
The atmosphere is maybe a bit disappointing. It's a large seating area with very open space, but you do have to navigate your way around a bit otherwise you'll hit a dead-end. They clearly appeal to seniors - a large section of their menu is priced specifically for them. It makes for a quiet dining experience, but more dull than calm (which may not be a bad thing, depending on what you're in the mood for).  
All that said, I think 3 stars is appropriate. Everything was good, but the only thing that really stood out was the serving sizes. I may go back again, but I'm more inclined to explore other places."}
{"text":"2 stars?  3 stars?
Okay 3.
I didn't get sick and the food was hot and they were nice - that qualifies, right?
Think 1974 and you're just about right; the salad bar is iceberg lettuce and you're warned to not go more than once.
Avocado and harvest gold is everywhere.
'Captain' is begging to be spelled \"Cap'n\".
Okay, no more snarky comments; it is what it is.  Lots of older folks and you're in the middle of small town America.  The food is pretty insipid, but none of us got sick.
The hushpuppies WERE pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Green shrimp tasted prefrozen alittle on the soggy side
Fake bacon bits on the salad bar
My child's spaghetti was good though
Not impressed for the price"}
{"text":"My favorite seafood restaurant in NC. The seafood is always consistent and always very good and fresh. I like to get the all you can eat shrimp. You get one trip to the salad bar that is included when you order an entree off the menu. The decor isn't that fancy but has a rustic charm. They have another location in Denver that I've been to a few times and another in Gastonia that I've never been to. Check them out!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to this place for years and it is a perfect example of a southern Carolina fish camp.  If you're looking for arugula salad, fresh capers, and vegan weirdness, then motor on down to Atlanta, or catch an early flight back to San Francisco.  If you're looking for fresh, hot, delicious seafood and friendly people, then this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is a classic fish camp with good fish and shrimp. Pretty much everything is fried so keep that in mind. They have a plain salad bar but it is not bad at all. They have decent sized portions for the money."}
{"text":"Captain's Cap is a traditional southern Fish Camp.   There is a broiled section on the menu, but few folks order broiled that frequent this restaurant.   The seafood is fried and it is delicious.  The salad bar is good and there is a decent selection.  Most of the clientele are 65+ and most of the decor hasn't changed since Carter was in office."}
{"text":"Good seafood and decent prices. If you want fancy food, this isn't the place for you. If you want alcohol with your meal go elsewhere as well. However, if you want good fish/shrimp at a good price served quickly and efficiently - this is your place. You can get fried, broiled or boiled (shrimp)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great staff however, the fish was far from fresh.  I had grouper and they attempted to cover up the fact that it was old by slicing it thin and over cooking it.  The cheaper fried perch was just as old, but edible.  I will not visit them again."}
{"text":"Loved it!! The fried fish was amazing... sooo good!! They seem to have really amazing specials on a daily that would benefit both your stomach and your wallet!!"}
{"text":"Stayed in Belmont for the weekend and didn't want to drive far so we thought we would grab a bite to eat here- pretty much a mistake. 

I had the flounder and shrimp- they were very disappointing.  My wife had the charbroiled chicken breast and she thought it tasted like and had the texture of processed chicken.  Hoped for better, but was disappointed- some times when you go local you strikeout."}
{"text":"This is a very family-friendly, casual seafood restaurant with nice portions and great prices.  They serve both fried and broiled seafood, as well as steak and chicken. I had the broiled salmon with the baked sweet potato and salad bar.  I also tried a vinegar-based cole slaw (think similar to cold sauerkraut) from the salad bar and it was great. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient."}
{"text":"Captain's Cap is a fish camp. We went there for a friend's birthday in my pirate group. The space was great and they were good with accommodating a large group.

The inside vibe is old and the customers seem to be an older crowd as well. There's some ship and fisherman decor, but all seems a little out dated. 

Service was okay. Pitchers of water and tea were left at the table which cut down on needing refills. Hushpuppies came to the table first. After our trips to the salad bar, our plates weren't cleared which made the table seem crowded. Once the meals arrived, everything was shouted out. And not even five minutes into eating, they already wanted to bring our checks. Just seemed like they wanted to rush us out. 

The food is greasy and salad bar is unappetizing. The salad is iceberg and has lots of white pieces.  Even the tomatoes and cucumbers have a dull color. There's no light dresings. And the cheese tastes like processed cheese. The macaroni salad was okay. Most of the food is deep fried, but you get a lot of it. I ordered the crab cakes with onion rings. I didn't think the crab cakes would be deep fried, but they were. And all of the batters have the same fried taste. The crab cakes had a lot of breading in the mix and the flavor profile was off. Onion rings were super greasy. I didn't eat them all. Honestly, the best part of my meal was our dessert, which someone brought in. I left feeling sick from all the grease.  

They did an okay job accommodating our group, but the food makes me not want to come back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaraunt for years. The service is great but the food is subpar at best. The salad bar has fake cheese and imitation bacon bits. The fish is ok, sometimes a little overcooked. My husband is a fan of the green shrimp. The hushpuppies however are delicious!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. First visit and waitress left a lot to be desired. Was irritated at the very start of taking our order. Small portions for the pricey menu. Probably won't ever come back."}
{"text":"I have been a long time patron of Captains Cap in several locations. Ive noticed...its changed. Several days ago, I ordered take out of a small combo of flounder and fan tail shrimp. When I got home...I had two very small pieces of flounder...very thin.  5 shrimp..overcooked. The breading much like fast food or frozen breaded shrimp. The food was laying on top of aluminum foil...with soggy fries and decent hushpuppies beneath.  The tartar sauce...indescribably horrible...nothing like what I use to get there.  The cost....$18.43.  I was appalled when I got home and opened box. I called and spoke to manager...he said he would refund my money.  I returned the box of garbage...he refunded me and in his broken dialect...he said dont come back."}
{"text":"Took my Mom here today for a post Mother's day lunch. It's been about a year since our last visit. Salad bar is a one trip deal only and the salad plates are smaller than I remember last time. Hushpuppies are 2 bite sized and are very good with the right amount of sweetness and onion. My Mom got the senior flounder plate and I got one of the specials which was salt and pepper catfish fillets. Both included a side and the one trip to the salad bar.
Food was good, but both our flounder and catfish were on the thin side and not very meaty. Service was very friendly and attentive.
Lunch set me back $23 with drinks tax and tip which I thought was really pricey for lunch especially with the thin pieces of fish and considering my Mom ordered off of the senior menu and I got one of the specials."}
{"text":"Ate dinner with a friend here yesterday. Prices and service are good, including the food. Had a smaller fried perch dinner and clam (white) chowder, which seemed to me to be a bit watered down. Regardless, I'll certainly go again. Next to  the coleslaw at the salad bar was a kind of different slaw, a little like soured cabbage... try it, it's great. Oh, in case you were wondering, the onion rings are homemade and delicious. Just eat here, darn good!"}
