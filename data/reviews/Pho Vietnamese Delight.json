{"text":"I have been to this place for a couple times but this place is getting worse each visit. If I could give no star, this place is definitely the worst experience I have had. We ordered the cooked bean sprouts n they gave me the raw ones.  The thai soup was so salty that you could taste the amount of MSG in it. We paid $2 for the extra beef n there were NONE. The food was not good n the service made it worse. there are many other pho resturant, so I will never come back to this one. I wont recommend this place to anyone either."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  My husband picked up take out from here and not only did it smell funny, but I was \"in the bathroom\" the whole night.  I've eaten at some lousy places and in tropical places (Mexico, South America) and never got sick until I ate from the place.  Never again!  Don't know how it's stayed open as long as it has!"}
{"text":"Had the pho beef brisket here this time, and the fried spring rolls. 

Delicious pho soup and lots of noodles and meat! Generous with the spring rolls portions as well.

Have been here before, and well come back again .

Quick service and decent value."}
{"text":"Best pho in town, hands down. Hygiene could be a bit of concern. If you prefer Chinese flavour over Vietnamese, and ok with spicy food, try the spicy beef vermicelli in soup. Dry mouth afterwards is typical due to the amount of MSG, but what the hell."}
{"text":"This place is so gross. I got the rare beef noodle soup: beef was extremely fatty and the soup was very oily. My friend got the steamed vegetables (she is a vegetarian) and she got a sad plate of steamed bok choy only soaked in oil.

I had come here a previous time and got their pho in thai style. Do not get this! It has a strong fishy taste to it that makes you gag. I love how the two times I've been here and never finish my food (like barely touched) did anyone ask me if my food was okay.

There won't be a third time."}
{"text":"I hate to be the person that changes the reputation of a restaurant. Came here during the ice storm blackout as I was powerless. The two male waitstaff were friendly and quick to respond.  The portions were huge for the price, and if you like to eat cheap.

Here's the negative, i had a seat facing the open kitchen. While eating I was watching a person prep. Bins would be placed on the floor (the oil stained cardboard boxes) and he would push diced up scallions into the bins. When he missed the bin, he would scoop it up and place it back in the bin. This also happened with the rare beef. He would mix the beef in the bin, some would fall out, and nevertheless he would pick it off the floor and place it back in the bin.  I saw a piece he missed to pick up, the. I saw him step on it! Good thing he didn't put it back in the bin.

I know health standards are different in other countries, but this is Canada, at least build a door so I don't need to know I'm eating food that fell on the floor!"}
{"text":"The portions are well sized like most vietnamese pho restaurants.  Their broth is tasty and their pho is well cooked.  I've been there several times and always leave really satisfied and full."}
{"text":"PLEASE SEE PICTURE UPLOADED. There was a blue elastic band in my soup noodle!!

I used to come here quite often as I find the food better quality than other pho places in the area (especially pho 88 of course). The Thai style house pho is my favorite. But this place is getting worse, both in service and cleanliness.

I recommended my friend to go there before and she said there was hair in her rice dish. But sometimes it is difficult to avoid hair falling. However, I went there recently, there was a BLUE ELASTIC BAND in my soup noodle!! It is totally UNACCEPTABLE!!

As for service, overall is okay. But the female owner (i believe) is always bitching about other customers behind their back in Cantonese. I find it very annoying and unprofessional! If you want your customers to come back, you gotta stop bitching loudly, especially about tips."}
{"text":"Staff ignored me as I tried to get their attention and had the nerve to ask for a tip as I was paying my bill.. don't bother"}
{"text":"Special beef noodle is good. I still ordered another one I forgot the name. Just noodle with some vegetables, no soup but with some spring rolls and meat . I don't like this one. I don't like its taste. A little weird for me."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho period.  I don't live in the neighbourhood anymore, but still go here every now and then, cause the Pho is unmatched."}
{"text":"Price and service is alright. The waiter is very nice. The food is meh.."}
{"text":"I get excited every time a non-korean restaurant opens up near the Yonge-Finch intersection.  Don't get me wrong, I love Korean food, but the area could use more variety.

Place has a nice welcoming interior that makes it easy to stay for a quick meal or get take out. 

Personal favorite by far is the Thai beef soup noodle.  It has a tom yum soup broth that works surprisingly well with thai noodles.  My former roommate and I are hooked.

The regular viet beef noodles are average.  Nothing to celebrate, but nothing to complain about.  The satay beef noodles are solid, but I prefer the one across the street at wonderpho.

Overall a very nice addition to the area and it appears they're here to stay based on the consistent business they've had so far.  The food is good and consistent and does the job when you're in the mood for viet."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for a late supper.

My first impression was very disappointing at best.  I gave this place a 1 star for the following reasons
- The waiter was not friendly at all
- Ordered the beef pho, which was extremely bland
- They were very stingy with the meat (5 thin slices of beef in a giant bowl of noodles)
- The utensils were dirty
- The food was not authentic Vietnamese (the food is a Chinese interpretation of Vietnamese cuisine)
- After giving us the food, the waiter never came back... Not even to give us a bill (we had to walk to the cashier to pay)
- The washroom was dingy and dirty (I felt like I was crawling into a hole)


The only reason why I gave a single star, instead of flat Zero, is because the overall portion of food to the cost was fairly decent.  I still think they should have given more meat, but for $7 per bowl, it's hard to expect more."}
{"text":"My favorite pho in the city. Delicious broth, not too oily or over done, big portions, and good price."}
{"text":"ok food but bad service. the waiter never talk to u or answer u when u talk to him. the food is average and i'd rather visit otjer places to eat pho."}
{"text":"There were several customers at the restaurant and kept the staff busy.  Our order was taken a few minutes after arriving and it took a while for the food to reach our table.  Customers who came in afterward had their meals served before us.  The dishes were brought to our table quickly once confirming the order with our server."}
{"text":"The WORST Vietnamese noodle in Toronto! You won't find meat you can eat in the noodle since they only give you the parts people don't/cannot eat. The soup tastes just so so, you don't need to go to a restaurant to have it, you can make it at home (after you try it, you will find you can cook better than the chef)!"}
{"text":"I don't really give 1 stars unless I feel like I've wasted my money.

I used to enjoy this place but the last couple of visits the broth has either been too bland or too salty.

Also, There is a sign on the door that says in large letters spend $20 or more get free spring rolls. Spend $30 or more receive free chicken wings. Mind you it is for your next visit. Upon leaving I had to remind them for that coupon however I do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"I would give this location ZERO STARS if I could. AVOID AT ALL COST. Service was extremely slow on Sunday 3-4PM. Host (Female ~50) was VERY rude to me and my friends. We are a group between 24-30 working professionals.

Did not take orders or offer us water/tea for 10 minutes after we arrived. We flagged her down to order after waiting far too long. Caucasian friend was vegetarian and asked for meatless options, and she said \"no\" and cussed at her in mandarin under her breath. While the majority of the group didn't speak Mandarin, I did, and heard it very clearly.

We then decided to order several items to split and she scoffed as if we were being cheap for wanting to try more items on the menu. She also forgot to bring us the extra bowls we requested to split, as well as the soda and soy milk that we ordered. 

She gave us the bill while we were still eating (bill for soda and soy milk clearly visible despite not having bought it out until reminded twice), and when we paid she demanded a 20% tip when we've already given a very UNDESERVING 10%."}
{"text":"After my visit to their other location at Finch and Yonge, and reading recent reviews on this location as well, I can only conclude that there were new owners who doesn't give a cow's arse about maintaining quality. This location USED to have a fantastic management and staff was friendly. It seems that isn't the case anymore. I'll look for pho somewhere else, thanks."}
{"text":"Their portions definitely are bigger than other pho restaurants I've been to, however, the older waitress stopped us at the end and asked for MORE TIPS. L M A O ???
Umm, who does that? Should've taken back the tip we originally gave her.
Clearly they don't care about repeat customers cause that left a horrible and bitter impression. Bah!"}
{"text":"A friend and I ordered take-out here. As I would in any new pho experiences, I went with the house special. The portions were very large for the price and it's definitely filing if you're looking to bloat yourself. However, the broth is definitely lighter than most pho establishments, of which I personally was not a fan. If you're looking for a less robust flavour and more food from your pho, then this might be a place to check out."}
{"text":"Ate here and the hygiene level scored zero. Found stuff in the bowl of pho."}
{"text":"The portions are huge, but the pho is filled with MSG. Again, it's rare to find a pho place that doesn't load their soup with MSG. Therefore, my rating is based on the overcooked  noodles and beef that isn't raw when served. 

The floors of this restaurant is somehow sticky when I walk on it, and there's a few flies lingering around tables. The chopsticks were also sticky.. I really don't know if this is because of the dish detergent they use.. or if they're not properly cleaned. 

Well, I have to say I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited this place with my mom, brother and boyfriend. Came in on a busy Sunday afternoon, the place was almost packed to the brim. There were a few tables with no one seated on them but were filled with dirty dishes, implying that the servers have no cleaned up after the customers left. During the day of our visit, the entire restaurant, which was full, was staffed by only two servers who also are the cashier and cleaner as well as they seemed to be severely understaffed. 

Food
I ordered the Lemongrass Fried Beef with Rice, my boyfriend ordered Rare Beef Noodle Soup, brother ordered the Lemongrass chicken with Rice while my mom ordered the House Special Noodle Soup and the Shrimp Roll. According to them, they all said the food was very good and was worth the money, especially given that the large noodle is only a dollar more than the smaller size. The food themselves also came out rather quickly despite being severely understaffed themselves. As for my rice, I found the flavor to be slightly on a heavier side, which is fairly common with vietnamese rice, but was overall acceptable and good.

Atmosphere/Experience
The place was only staffed by two servers and both of them were running around in a frantic manner when we were there. During our visit, another table apparently was missing one of their order, leading to the lead server screaming at the other server quite loudly in Mandarin. This caused a lot of heads to turn and was quite disruptive. In addition, the restaurant was also surrounded with dirty plates and dishes which the servers understandably didn't clean due to how understaffed they are. 

Overall, this place isn't bad for a quick fix of Vietnamese food. The food is good and the price is also fair."}
{"text":"There are some places that I question and this one is definitely one of them. 

First off the name of this franchise in chinese translates to 'Fat Cow Noodles' with a picture of a fat cow. However the english name that is displayed is \"Pho Vietnamese Delight\". Always a big pet peeve of mine when it comes to chinese vs english names for businesses.

This place is no where near authentic viet but the food is still good. The portion sizes are massive and you do get your bank for your buck. A small pho is almost like a medium-large. Can you imagine what their large is like? I'm a big eater but I can barely finish a small on its own. The broth is flavorful and not fatty like other places such as XeLua and Pho88. However the broth also is a bit different then genuine pho. There's something about it that makes you want more. You WILL be thirsty afterwards as they over power your meal with MSG.  The other dishes such as rice or vermicelli dishes are as well very good. Portion sizes are big for those too.

Service wise, they are crap. Like all their franchise locations, they follow the stereotypical chinese/mainland service with rudeness, dirtyness and greedy for cash. Like for example, i do not appreciate having my table wiped clean with the same cloth used to wipe the food/soup that was spilled on the floor. I do not like to be moved to another table midway through my meal to accommodate a larger group. I also do not like the bill served to me when i'm still eating to hint that i need to go to accommodate others. I also do not like to be told that the amount on the bill is before tax and tip although i'm still taking out cash from a different pocket to accommodate the tax and tip. Oh and the greatest one yet, having their server speak to you in mandarin but realize you do not understand them so they make some snarly remark. I questioned \"pardon me\"?... he gives me the \"argh\" and shoves me back. 

All of the above has happen in multiple occasions but why do I come back? Well it is because it's the closest pho place near my work and the broth is good. Otherwise I would never come back.

Would I recommend this place? Yes but ONLY if you drop your standards."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of pho and have tried many different pho restaurants in Toronto and in other cities. The portions at Pho Vietnamese Delight is definitely much bigger than most other pho restaurants I have been to. For less than $10, the value is definitely there. The pho is also very good, the soup was spot on and the toppings were very generous. There are a lot of other different menu items, such as curry and Hainanese chicken. I will definitely be back to try those later. Parking is very convenient in the plaza. Service was decently fast for a small restaurant. Tip, if you come during weekday lunch hours, it is very busy as there are alot of students from the nearby College."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Good food and reasonable price. Although Vietnamese noodles are not authentic, I come here all the time for the Hainanese chicken rice."}
{"text":"I've come here half a dozen times in the last month, miraculously..I still have change left in my wallet. 

Seven dollars for a small bowl, eight for large. You can practically swim in the portions. The BBQ chicken and rice here is decent as well, and it pairs nicely with the seasonal vegetable in garlic oil. During the day, you may run into a highly enthusiastic waitress who is also louder than a steam whistle. She's quick to bring out your order, and refills the cup of water whenever is comes close to half empty. I said half empty because it makes more sense here...not because I'm a pessimist. 

This is a very average local restaurant, and it seems to cater to many Seneca students. The level of service declines as the time draws closer to evening. The lively waitress is replaced by a much less perky young Man, who makes sure he does no more than he is paid to. It also feels slower here at night, even when there are more tables. 
The food is consistent, never waiting more than ten minutes for your order.
The spring rolls is a bit hard to chew, I don't actually remember spring rolls being the way they are here in Vietnam. In fact, pho is completely different in Vietnam...for starters, our portions are unimaginable. But, I don't think that's something I could complain about...we must be pigs in the eyes of the Vietnamese..almost like how we look at Americans with their fast food addiction.

There's not much to say about this place, when I'm hungry I come here..and with what change I find in my pant pockets, I manage to buy myself a meal. 


Perhaps my most boring review yet..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch just because my mom and I was in the area and hungry. There aren't many choices of restaurants from this plaza. 

Price was affordable and portion size was quite generous. I haven't try their hainanese chicken which I would return to do so. I ordered satay beef noodle with fresh pho. My mom ordered special pho with everything. 

My noodle soup wasn't hot.. which was a disappointment. The raw beef was raw to my liking however it really does match their restaurant name in Chinese \"fatty beef\". I had to take out quite a lot of fat from the sliced beef. The fresh pho wasn't as soft as I liked but if the soup was hotter, I would maybe like it more. 
My mom's pho soup was HOT. like it was on point, and flavor wasn't bad compared the pricing. The price is generally lower than average Vietnamese restaurants. 

We ordered an appetizer platter. Suprrisingly this platter was the bomb! the spring roll was fried just right (not over fried/ dried), the rice paper roll was good in a way the ingredients inside has shrimps and bean sprouts. The beef and chicken skewers was really flavorful. The beef was soft, tender and beefy! I love it a lot. Each comes with a side of paring dipping sauce which it matches quite well imo. 

*ONLY ACCEPT CASH/ DEBIT*

I would definitely return to try more from their menu if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today because I had some business to attend to and this was the closest eatery around that I thought would be quick in and out.  Also I love a hot bowl of noodles in the winter.  

The seating was really squishy but as expected during the lunch hour.  With a quick look around I can tell that this place is frequented by students from the nearby Seneca campus.  I guess if I was a student there, I would come here too.  It's cheap and the portions of noodles they give you is generous.  I ordered a large bowl of house special pho, but next time IF I ever go back, I will order the small.  There was plenty in the large.  Actually let me clarify, there was plenty of noodles.  The amount of meats was fine and the beef tendon was really soft which was really good. 

Now I can't really comment on the cleanliness of the place.  I don't usually venture into the back and to the washrooms in these joints.  I rather hold it in and use the washroom when I get back to the office.  However from reading the other reviews for this place, it seems like it's subpar when it comes to hygiene.  Good thing I didn't have to go today.  

So in conclusion, my bowl of pho was okay.  However had I seen the inside of the kitchen like the other people that reviewed here, I may have ran out if I saw what they saw."}
{"text":"This Pho place serves not just Vietnamese pho but rice/noodle dishes, Malay curries, satays & roti. I tried their lunch special Hainanese chicken & rice. It was not bad:  the chicken was moist and tasty (even better with the gingery dipping sauce) and the rice could have been more flavorful but ok. Would come back and try their many pho and variations when I'm back in the area. This place is just a short walk south of Yonge/Finch station. Street parking available."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing, just decent bowl of pho. The bowl was pretty big for a small, and If I remember correctly, it was only 6$ for the portion of noodles and meat I got. Service was OK, atmosphere was OK, again, nothing amazing or worth mentioning lol. Only came here because I wanted pho and was around the Yonge and Finch area."}
{"text":"More of a 2.5 to be honest, but I deducted half a star because of poor service. Food itself was avg, I ordered the rare beef with beef balls. Rare beef was not rare, and the beef balls were cold, so I had to submerge it in the soup and save it for later to eat. Though overcooked rare beef is common at chinese pho restaurants, I have NEVER had a cold beef ball before, this was the first. The soup base was pretty standard, but for some reason there was an after taste to it that I can't quite describe. Perhaps the rice/curry dishes may be better, I don't know. Now what I really disliked was the service. Though the waitress there was polite, the other lady (presumable the owner due to her lack of uniform) however was quite rude. When we asked for the bill, we put our credit card on the table for a long time, then the nice waitress saw it and told us that they are debit only. That's fine, so we switched to a debit card, but by that time the waitress had walked away to do something else. So again, we waited for someone to come take our money, then the boss lady very rudely told us to go up to the cash to pay. Really? They couldn't tell us this at the same time that they told us debit only? Obviously I don't expect great service from Chinese restaurants, cause I'm used to it by now. But I expect to have efficiency at the least. As a result, I could only give this place a two star for now."}
{"text":"My friend Tian brought me here for the first time so the company was good as usual and this place is good too but not the best.  This is proof that more doesn't make you better. The pack the pho bowl with tons of noodles and meat, more than most but the flavour is only just OK, not the best. Clearly your dose of msg for the day.  I prefer the pho place in Ozzie-hood,  Pho Tien Thanh 57 Ossington, of you love pho, try this place."}
{"text":"This was the worse food experience ever! This food here will kill you and the place is a pig sty. I've seen better looking soup broth in my toilet bowl after a night of hard drinking. If someone tries to bring you here, jump out of the car and run, don't look back, just run. I like Vietnamese food and eat it quite often. I enjoy it so much that I began to think it was impossible to mess it up... until Pho Vietnamese Delight. First it is not owned or run by Vietnamese, it is run by Chinese, that says enough right there! Tonight,  It started with the hot tea. The waitress brings it to the table in a large cheap soiled plastic picture, you can smell the plastic melting from the heat of the tea. The waitress poured it into old dirty looking plastic cups. You can smell the BPA from the plastic leaching into the tea. Seriously, literally you can smell it.  I'm with friends that I like and respect,  I wanted to say something and just leave but it just wouldn't have been appropriate. Finally our soup arrives, in a large oversized plastic stained soup bowl. I didn't eat it, I just picked at it.  This place breaks all the health rules. Hot food and plastic should be against the law, it is poison and can change your entire hormone structure. Known fact, breast cancer comes rom BPA exposure in plastic.  This place is BPA central and you can taste it in the food. Remember, run, don't look back and please folks start to demand more. If not for yourselves, do it for your children.

Did I mention I wasn't fond of this place?"}
{"text":"Decent place but not great. I'm pretty critical of pho and was hoping for a winner here but was a little disappointed. A perfect pho broth has a clarity and lightness to it, heady aromas, full of flavour, but light...you know what I mean? It's that hard-to-achieve balance that makes the perfect pho. The pho here has a dark, heavy broth, initially giving the impression of beef flavour but ultimately falling short. It's like it was flavoured and coloured with soy sauce, giving it saltiness but no significant depth of flavour. Quantity and price were certainly good though. Noodles and beef were plentiful and decent quality. I also had satay chicken skewers and they were very good."}
{"text":"Worth going to if you're nearby and looking for Vietnamese food, but don't go too far out of your way. Lunch specials (Monday-Sunday) are pretty affordable at $6.99, and the main menu is also reasonably priced (most meals in the $9-11 range). The fried foods like spring rolls and Malaysian roti (basically a paratha) are very good, but the other dishes (pho, noodles, curries) are average. 

The place was pretty busy at lunchtime on the weekend, but the service was still pretty quick."}
{"text":"Now, I'm not usually one to come to a Vietnamese restaurant for dinner, but a friend chose it, and I had no other suggestions, so we ended up here.

Came somewhat later that the usual dinner rush, so it was a little quieter in the restaurant. Lots of seating, so we didn't have to wait long, but the service was a bit slow with only 1.5 servers working. (One was on break while we were there). 

I don't really like pho, so I ordered the Pork with Rice and Curry Sauce. The Pork was quite good, but the soup it came with was ALL MSG, and the curry was barely spicy at all! Definitely not worth that extra ~$1.5 for the curry. My friend ordered a spicy pho, but not too sure what it was. He loves it, and says he orders it all the time!

Service was decent, but a bit slow as I mentioned. It was tough to get some more water or a napkin, and needed to ask specifically for it. Servers were also lacking on the enthusiasm, and I definitely felt like they didn't want to be there. 

I probably won't be back, as I don't even eat Pho."}
{"text":"I came during quieter times on a Monday night so service was fine. Had the special pho large and bun bo hue. I really like the pho noodles, felt like fresh noodles (tho it probably wasn't). The broth was okay, nothing special but a decent portion of meat for a large. The bun bo hue had pigs feet so definitely authentic and also a good portion of meat. The soup could be spicier tho and honestly a bit bland compared to the other ones I've had in the past. The pigs feet had a lot of feathers/hair tho still. (The hard kind that you can't really eat) Overall the prices were okay given how much meat you got. I would come again as not too much other Vietnamese choices in the area (and the xelua at Leslie and finch is not good). I will say I felt less thirsty afterwards compared to other pho places so maybe they just use less MSG."}
{"text":"Came here twice over the past two weeks.
Decor is pretty eh. Doesn't seem too clean, but I guess it works...

They have quite a number of options on the menu, whether you're looking for some curry, pho, rice, noodles, vegetable dishes, or just some light snacks.

For the pho, the portion sizes are no joke: their large is probably the same as an extra-large at other pho places. And it's only an extra dollar to upsize! Average price for a pho is under $10 for the large as well. If you can't finish the entire bowl in one sitting, you can ask to have it packed up in styrofoam containers and now you have two meals for the price of one! Can't go wrong with that.

The first time, I ordered the thai style house special beef noodle, which is basically their house special except with spicy and sour flavors. The second time I got the house special. You get a lot of rice noodles, and the amount of meat that comes with it is not bad. However, proportion wise, it feels like there isn't as much meat because there's so much noodles. If you like to take a bite of noodles and a bite of meat, you'll find yourself with an excess of noodles at the end.

The broth itself is pretty light. It feels a bit strange to drink though. I prefer the thai style broth because of the extra spicy and sour flavour added and that gives the noodles a bit more flavour. But the noodles in general don't have any flavour beyond what you would expect from rice noodles.

Service is pretty average. We came around 10 PM on a holiday and one of the employees was talking loudly in cantonese commenting on how long we were taking and how we aren't leaving. This was after the bill was sent to us shortly after the food arrived and said we should pay first. I mean, I guess it's a holiday so they just want to go home which is understandable. I just found it kind of amusing.

One of my DC's found a really short piece of hair in the pho. Given the other reports from previous reviews...sanitation might be an issue."}
{"text":"I will definitely return here for pho! The small size was soooo big I almost couldn't finish it, but then I am a twenty-something Asian, might have something to do with it :P I didn't want the rare beef so they gave me more brisket, the broth did have a hint of MSG, but show me a pho place that doesn't nowadays! The small size was $6.50 and well worth it! I live near East Chinatown and the vietnamese places were much saltier, this place is really good, in my books and seating is pretty good. :D"}
{"text":"I had their pho several times. Well portioned and well priced just like most pho places I've tried. Pho is such good value that I think it rivals McDonalds. Of course, I like pho much more. 

Pho is such a standard dish that I can't find much to write about. Since they all taste about the same. my main criteria now for good pho is the temperature of the soup. The soup should be hot enough when it arrives at my table. Pho Delight achieves this well. 

I did try their rice and vermicelli dishes and that's where the differences become more apparent. Pho Delight is Chinese owned and I find the taste of their rice/vermicelli dishes more \"Chinese\" than Viet. The taste is lighter than at Pho Mi 99 in Sauga (Pho Mi 99 is Viet owned). Also, the spring rolls are not as crispy and savory as the Viet versions. 

Since it's the closest pho restaurant to my house, I'll probably come again. I wouldn't get the rice/vermicelli dishes again but the pho is definitely more than adequate. Their prices are good too. As I recall, if you order over $20, you get a freebie. You'll definitely get your bang for your buck at Pho Delight."}
{"text":"What I love about smaller family-run restaurants is the portion to price ratio.  You often receive a larger than life portion size for your cheap eats.  That pretty sums up Pho Vietnamese Delight. I could definitely stop this review here after having said that, but there would be no fun in that, would there?

I came here twice with friends.  Its location is very convenient, with it being next to Finch Station as well as H-Mart.  What characterizes this pho place from others are the massive bowls used for the large size at a very reasonable $1 increase in price.  When I say they are massive, I really mean that!  It could feed two-three hungry hippos!  Of course, knowing me and my frugal ways, I opted to eat the large size by myself because of the short change I was giving for the size up.  We ordered the House Pho (number 121) and the House Pho in Thai Style (number 132), as they were claimed to be the most popular item by the lady running the shop.  They were both under 10 dollars after tax.  The dishes arrived almost instantly, and what was noticeable was that number 132 was almost identical to number 121, except that they stirred in a sour, tomato sauce (think of Tom Yum sauce).  I would have appreciated some more creativity with the broth for the Thai style dish.  However,  if the broth of 121 is their main specialty, then it's all fair game, right?  No. For 121, the broth was nothing more than what I would consider a salty, watered down soup.  It was a disappointment compared to the broth I had received the first time I visited to order 121.  The memory of me happily slurping up my noodles then has been torn apart, replaced by my currently low regard for their quality.  Frankly, the caveat of going here is that you may receive a broth without depth that even the noodles can't absorb for flavour.  

With so many noodle restaurants competing with this one in the same neighbourhood, I would write this one off.  Try Big Beef Bowl instead.  At least you'll get decent to good quality food there for the same level of service, sanitary practices, and speed of service."}
{"text":"First time here. I came with my friend who likes pho. We ordered the large appetizer platter (picture below). It came with spring rolls, chicken and beef skewer along with some meat pieces. We also shared a large pho.

I loved the taste of their chicken skewers and the dipping sauce. I surely recommend that you try them out. I also liked their spring rolls. Large pho is HUGE even for two people. I liked the taste of it but my friend said he had better. Price is very reasonable. Someone next to me ordered curry chicken and it looked tasty. I will try it out next time.

Clean establishment. Great service. Free WiFi. While I'm not an expert in pho I have to say that I surely liked it. I strongly recommend their appetizers especially the chicken skewers & spring rolls."}
{"text":"Pho Vietnamese Delight is a standard place if you are looking for a mix of Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese cuisine. I came to this place with my friends as we were looking for a quick meal to satisfy our hunger after a 5K run. 

The food is fairly decent as there were a lot of options to choose from, ranging from Pho to Vermicelli to Hainan Chicken on Rice. There are some very good options from their special menu as a spring roll and drink is included for $6.25. The pho broth is average at best, as it was very salty, as compared to other authentic broths from other pho places. 

The service was average, as there were not many waiters during the time we dined. So, therefore, our table's requests were not attended towards , as immediately as we hoped for.  

Overall, Pho Vietnamese Delight is an average place to eat at if you are looking for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I decided to hit up this place last night for a second try after a somewhat mediocre first experience in the winter. The first time I had ordered the Malaysian Chicken Curry and last night I got the Malaysian Beef Brisket curry. As you can tell, I'm a fan of Malaysian curry and since my wife is Malaysian, I'm very familiar with how it should taste. 
In short, I was extremely extremely disappointed with the meal last night - it was brutal and much worse than the first time. Malaysian curry (also known as rendang curry) is typically made using a coconut milk base. While I can reluctantly give these guys points for the coconut flavored gravy, I must say that they completely bombed with the meat. What was supposed to be a nice bowl of slow-cooked beef brisket, turned out to be a bowl of FAT. I kid you not; every piece of meat was a huge chunk of fat and the little meat that was there underneath fat was grossly undercooked. It was just disgusting and I had to bail on finishing it. The only saving grace was the gravy but when you're staring at a bowl of fat, you're bound to lose your appetite instantly. Needless to say, I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"ive been here for 4 years. love this place. i always order 133 with chicken instead of beef. 
the taste is a bit different depends on the day."}
{"text":"The lemongrass stuffs are good. Nevertheless, the pho is not as good as I expect. But the price is kind of fair."}
{"text":"Horrible service but decent food. The server did not ask us for our order neither did he come to give our checks. And as if that was not bad service enough, the server fought with us for not tipping. I would not recommend going to this place."}
{"text":"When I first saw this place developing a year ago, I was pretty excited as everything in the area was pretty much Korean not to say Korean food isn't awesome. 

This is an OK Pho place, it's not authentic Pho, I think even on one occasion they admitted it's not authentic Vietnamese so the taste might be different, lol what? I actually make the drive out to Hung Long as the Pho is much better and 'authentic' but that's in another review. 

The few times I had rice the pork chop was kinda burnt. 

All in all I'd say visit this place if you want something quick in the area and had a hankering from some ok'ish type Pho. Service is decent at least."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, the salty taste of MSG. 
This restaurant deserves one extra star because their portions are unusually large compared to many competitors for the same price.
The large can feed a small country.

The noodles are plain and don't have the kind of bounce you'd expect from pho. They're nothing special. The soup is salty and the thin small pieces are beef are not even worth my time. I've also tried the bun noodles- again, plain and just.. not good. The satay beef noodles are super spicy with little satay taste. They made me choke a bit on the saltiness of the spice and needless to say, I didn't finish my food because of that. The only reason why'd I come here is because it's convenient: pretty much right on the corner of yonge and finch.

The more you chew the noodles, the more it tastes like plastic.
I'd have a better chance finding a vietnamese sugar daddy to make me food from the motherland than getting satisfying pho here."}
{"text":"We go there or Pho more particularly Beef tendon, lean beef, and tripe and for Tom Yun soup for my wife. Both are consistent, tasty and freshly prepared. They keep long hours-until 3 a.m. in case of a Pho emergency. For us its a dependable, inexpensive meal when we are running late. Not a place for a hot date!"}
{"text":"Recently had a quick lunch there. It is well priced, tasty and the service is efficient. The Pho was rich in flavor and they offer several soup bases for other noodle soups. This is a step above most Pho place. I would return for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"One of the worse pho I ever been to. Waiters are very rude and don't have any smile at there face. They just give one napkin for 2 peoples when I paid for my food. The waiter demanded very rudely that he wants tips. You get tips when you do proper customers service. Your customers service sucks and the food was not good at all. When I give the waiter 50 cent tip they talk shit about it in there own language. I wish I knew what they are saying."}
{"text":"How is it that I have not been to this restaurant before?

This restaurant seats about 50 people and even though we were late leaving the office for lunch, luckily there was one table left and with us seated, the restaurant was full by 12:30pm!

Vietnamese Delight has a few 'lunch' specials (available 11am - 5pm!) for $6.99 that include either soup or a spring roll but I opted to order from the main 'placemat' menu and had the Malaysian Curry Chicken with rice for $6.99.

The dish consisted of a bowl of skin on, bone in chicken thighs with potatoes in a curry sauce and a plate of rice. Although this dish was quite delicious, I doubt I would order it again.

Here's the thing... I get the whole 'cooking with the skin and bone adds flavour' but it's just too much work to eat and the chicken can tend to be undercooked, as it was in my case.

This dish ended up being mostly rice, a bit of potato and, after discarding all of the overly pink and red pieces, very little chicken. Although I do have to say, if it wouldn't have been completely inappropriate, I would have asked for a straw to slurp up every last bit of that curry sauce! Mmmm.

This restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. Despite the fact that they were completely full, the service was quick and friendly. I'll definitely be back to sample other items from their menu.

Note: They only accept cash or debit and there is a $0.25 surcharge for using debit. Shouldn't this be considered part of the cost of doing business? Why is this being passed on to the customer?"}
{"text":"Decent pho place. Takeout is very fast, maybe 5 minutes for them to pack up an order of pho. Ambience is non existent because it's not that kind of place. Prices are good, around $10-15 for a full meal. They also have other Thai or Malaysia fusion items if you didn't come for pho."}
{"text":"The pho is really good and the portion sizes are huge. Lots of selection on the menu. One of the best pho restaurants in North York."}
{"text":"After the minimum wage increase, there are not many places that offer good value for your money but this place still does. Their lunch special is only $7.25 and you get a pretty big portion. Food is overall pretty good and their service is really fast. They also have a 10% discount card for $10, valid for 1 year but you cannot apply it to the specials."}
{"text":"Came here with friends after a hike. Ordered Special with Thai sauce while my friends ordered the regular special. Came in a massive bowl. It had a lot of contents in it and for $10.50, it's not bad. One thing is the meat was a bit too fatty for me. Nothing much to say about the decor. Service was okay."}
{"text":"I went to this place today, me and my boy were walking around and decided to check this place out ... The pho u were decent nothing impressive ... I actually had better many times but it is not bad in the mean time ... If u want good food get the spring rolls they r bonerific ... I will defiantly  come back here just to taste the Vietnamese spring roll served right here ... I will recoment to get the platter the meat source came with it was very tasty for skewers.

There is a side seat right at this place ... There was a single girl sitting by herself after she left there was another girl who can by her self too ... I am not sure what is going on in that seat but maybe I should check it out"}
{"text":"Good Pho and in a city full of Pho restaurants good is a good review. Pho is the McDonalds of Vietnamese food and there are hundreds of places, a lot are mediocre and not that clean. Vietnamese Delight is clean with friendly service and the food is good standard Vietnamese food, I would stop in again when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Pricing is lower than average especially for their portion size.  Their lunch special ($6.99) is till 5pm everyday, which is great for me since I like to eat around 2-4pm  where most lunch specials would end.  Mind you that the lunch special menu is small and not extensive at all, but even at regular price the pricing is competitive.  I usually order their hainanese chicken rice and spring roll.  My friends who come with me usually order their pho, where I take a small bowl & take some of their noodles .  We share food .  I like the pho and hainanese chicken rice and they never disappoint me.  I have had better pho, but this place is still decent especially for the location (it's very close to my house), wait time, convenience, and pricing!  I love their hainanese chicken better than most places (especially for the pricing).  Their service is pretty fast.  You order food and around 5 minutes or so your food is ready.  If ur super hungry and don't want to wait, this is the place for u.  The decor is pretty normal Viet restaurant decor, so not fancy or anything.  This place is good for a quick bite.   It's no Michelin star restaurant but it hits the spot."}
{"text":"It's not a Vietnamese restaurant, they only imitate Vietnamese foods. Therefore it's easy to understand why the Pho and other Vietnamese foods here are tasted so bad. Also the waitress there is really rude, she put the glass of water on the table hard enough that it splashed all over my friends and on the table, then she asked for more tips... I mean, it's bloody terrible the service."}
{"text":"It's a fast and simple Vietnamese/Malaysian restaurant. Not a fan of the vermicelli noodles they use but their Thai style beef pho is the best (#132) Little spicy and delicious. Ask for the think noodles otherwise you'll get the wide flat ones. The Malaysian curry and pork fresh rolls are also great."}
{"text":"Don't order the pho, find a different location... MSG was the only thing I tasted."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good price, good food, but do not expect a fancy decor or a service here. The lady who I'm assuming to be the owner of the restaurant can come off as a bit rude but I realized it's just the way she talks. I usually come here for pho and the portion is pretty generous. Can't forget to mention the clean/clear broth because I do not enjoy broths that are greasy/oily. Street parking is available and TTC is very close by as well. Note that they only accept debit or cash."}
{"text":"Due to the random power outage in my apartment/area, my parents and I went across the street to grab some food at this restaurant.  We've been here, and the food is never consistent. The first time I went, it was delicious, but I haven't been impressed ever since.

My mom ordered a lemongrass chicken dish with rice, my dad had the Hainan chicken, and I had the chicken skewer, spring roll and vermicelli.  My dad said the Hainan chicken was pretty good - but I enjoyed it more at Phoenix.  My mom's rice dish - we didn't really get to try since we were full from sharing the other two dishes.  My vermicelli dish was mediocre.  The fish sauce seemed too over powering.  Too much MSG.

Their pho dishes from previous experiences also had too much MSG in it as well.  However, it's quite a lot of food for the price you pay for."}
{"text":"I only had pho, without noodles, and it was tasty. I love tendon, and this place has large chunks of tendon and other tasty bits in the brisket. Seems pretty authentic.

Staff was friendly and service fast. Price is reasonable too."}
{"text":"Plain, brightly lit storefront restaurant.

The menu is a bit short and features some Malaysian curries and Hainan chicken as well as traditional Vietnamese dishes.  All are labeled in English.

Noodles were quite good but were thick rice noodles and not vermicelli as listed.  Tasty spring rolls.  Pleasant attentive service.

Menu is reasonable and priced similarly to other pho houses.  We did not have pho but will try on next visit.

Nothing super memorable, but quite okay if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ever since the first visit I have enjoyed the food and the service they provide. The restaurant overall is very clean and comfortable. The staff are extremely friendly and kind. In terms of service, we receive our food fairly quick and it is equally good every single time.

Whenever I go the typical order is the pho special, chicken and beef skewers with the curry sauce (which is amazing) =) On occasion I would order the chicken rolls which are very good IMO. The price range is fairly decent, I believe all the items on the menu is under 10$.

I would definitely come here again :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps I'll have to get used to this place once I start classes at Seneca. There are a few other choices in this plaza though, however in terms of noodles this is practically the only place. It's okay though.

I came here with my dad earlier today, and noticed that the owner was actually someone my dad knows! Ding, immediate discount. The place was moderately busy for 3pm, and my guess is it consistently gets customers due to its proximity with Seneca.

My dad ordered the satay beef noodle soup, while I ordered the well done beef with tripe noodle soup. First I must say that the satay soup base is of the Thai style, not the Vietnamese style, so do keep that in mind if you order it. Other than that my dad seemed to enjoy it. My well done beef with tripe noodle soup was also okay, although I should comment on the huge portions they have! I barely finished a small, and I was starving when I arrived. Lots of noodles, generous on the beef and tripe, and the soup base...was relatively standard.

Iced lemon tea is quite good, and I would definitely recommend that.

Free wifi! Ask for password."}
{"text":"2.5 stars!

I've been here three times and had spicy beef noodle soup and beef pho. Like most Vietnamese restaurants, I'm sure that there was MSG in it. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was very flavourful and tasty, but it tasted like there was MSG in it. My friend who was Vietnamese didn't actually like it very much and thought that it wasn't \"authentic\" enough. If you're looking for a quick and cheap restaurant for pho in the Yonge/Finch area, it's not bad, but like my rating says, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"

Atmosphere was very casual and it was a very small restaurant. The service is decent for an Asian restaurant, but they are quick, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Pros:
Friendly service
Portion size for food items good for price

Cons:
Food will not impress you

Pho Vietnamese Delight is your standard Pho joint.  It will get the job done, no more no less.  You get pretty good portions for what you pay.  As long as you temper expectations, you will be fine.

We came in and were greeted very nicely by the staff.  A high chair was brought automatically before we even had to ask for one.  The staff were very friendly throughout our time here.

I ordered a large bowl of pho and my wife got the curry vermicelli.  I also got an order of spring rolls as well.  Food comes out relatively quickly as with most pho restaurants.  The portions here are very good.  They give you a ton of meat in your pho.  The meat to pho noodle ratio here is excellent.  They gave my wife this huge bowl of vermicelli for her curry.  I knew right away she wasn't finishing all those noodles.

Taste wise, you're not going to get the best bowl of pho here.  It's pretty decentand like I said, as long as you know you're not getting the best, you'll be fine.  If you want something more authentic, you're in the wrong part of town for that here.  

My biggest gripe was the size of my HK milk tea.  They charge $4 here and the cup was a bit on the small side.  A little strange given the portion size of everything else here.

All in all, Pho Vietnamese Delight will satisfy you're craving if you're feeling pho.  If you want something more authentic you'll have to go to other parts of town."}
{"text":"Was feeling something quick and light, been to his plaza many times, and been to all the other restaurants here, never been here before.

Ordered the standard rare beef pho - Small Order $7.50

The atmosphere was quite and spacious.

The food came pretty fast.

The pho was regular, the meat portion and bean sprouts were generous. The soup was full of MSG.

Typical fast food pho place with a HK style menu.

Something else I noticed is, nobody had napkins. You actually have to ask napkins.. Even though all spoons, chopsticks, sauces, and sauce plates are self serve on the tables. You actually have to ask for napkins..

I wouldn't usually give this place 2 stars, but the other 2 Asian restaurants to the left and right are much better choice for taste and dollar."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday, with a few friends for lunch and it's a place that I normally go to when I'm in the east end and want pho.  Fortunately with this review, I'll continue going to it for its pretty consistent food, and generous portions but there are numerous areas that do need improvement for this to really put this pho place on the map.

I'm from Mississauga, and most of the good pho that I've had is mostly located in Mississauga, though there are some good places across the GTA.  I'm not sure if it's just Vietnamnese people in Sauga have an entrepreneurial spirit or what but it's certainly bloomed a lot in the West end.  But I digress...

Overall, the food is really good.  My friend ordered the \"House Special\" and the pho is pretty tasty, the broth is clear and I personally don't taste any MSG in it (I would tell only if my tongue is numb and is in dire need of water).  It's also included with a generous amount of noodles (a small size is not so small) and the tendon and tripe are perfectly cooked.  

For what I ordered, I got the Lemongrass Chicken rice dish and it was safe to say that everyone at my table wanted to grab my dish after most of them had a taste of the chicken, which for the record was juicy, flavourful (packed with Lemongrass taste) and well grilled.  We could not get over how yummy that was.  The rice, with the nice sweet/salty fish sauce was just an excellent dish.

The not-so-good's part of the meal was more on the service and I was left with the impression that they were a bit short staffed, although there wasn't a whole lot of people in the store.  One was at the bar while the other one was waiting tables.  When they had brought my rice dish, they forgot to provide the fish sauce and I had to flag the server twice in order to get my attention.  At a certain point, I thought I got the server's attention as she looked at me, but then turned away and went to another table and clean the dishes off that table.  I was slightly irritated by that, as I sat around 5 minutes while everyone is digging away with their food.

I do wish that they would do something with that bathroom though, it's a weird mix of a single person / public bathroom.  Not to mention, why are there a stack of chairs in the bathroom?  It's rather off-putting. 

In any case, good place for pho, big portions, tasty food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The service has always been very efficient and staff are very nice. 

I always order my trusty BBQ Pork, spring roll with vermicelli $7.50. The bowl is massive and comes with quite a bit of meat in there. Awesome! Also tried their seasonal veggies with garlic on other visits and it was quite tasty. 

Fast and cheap. But don't expect more. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered a spring roll with grilled pork on vermicelli. Spring was spoiled. Couldn't believe that they'd serve a bad spring roll to me!!! Never going back here again. I've had better tasting Vietnamese food elsewhere. Fish sauce wasn't even good. Should have known when I saw the vietnamese place owned & run by Chinese people."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food.  Awesome service...very accommodating & quick!!  Dishes are reasonably priced.  Have been here several times already & definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"There is obviously way better Viet restaurants out there, just not in the Yonge/Finch area.  Viet Delight is actually operated by Chinese people and the food served there are Viet and Malaysian.  I have never tried the Malaysian dishes and probably never will.  The Viet dishes are mediocre.  The pho meat look like scraps of beef and fat.  The tendon is fatty and hairy.  If it wasn't for star anise and cloves, the soup wouldn't even smell or taste like pho.  The closest item they have that is remotely Viet is the spring roll.  I give the spring roll an 8 out of 10.  There are 2 dishes I would recommend, 1. lunch special C, the vermicelli and beef skewers with a spring roll for $7.75 and/or 2. lunch special B, the lemongrass porkchop on rice (it also includes a hot/sour soup) for $7.50.
Don't do the shakes, it's all condense milk and milk and sliver of whatever fruit you ordered.
Anyone looking for authentic Vietnamese food operated by Vietnamese people have to travel to the west end Pho Tien Thanh (Ossignton/Queen) or Pho Mi Asia (Keele/Wilson) or for the best of the best Pho Dau Bo (Weston/Finch)."}
{"text":"Huge portions and the pho is pretty good. $7.50 for a small but in reality its the size of a medium/large! The amount of noodles is ridiculous, so trust me on this -- just order a small and you'll be mighty full. 

Service is prompt and the food comes out in seconds. Literally. Not a minute goes by after we order and BOOM its out. Good or bad I don't know lol.

Clean and doesn't smell like dirty cloths. That's a win in my opinion."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here. I found it strange that they didn't have any non-meat dishes. Luckily they were able to make some of their dishes meatless for me. One was the pad thai which was good but heavy on the onions. The other was vermicelli with just the cucumber, peanuts, lettuce, radish & carrots. Still yummy!"}
{"text":"We came here to get some takeout. We ordered the chicken skewers with vermicelli, chicken wings, pork with vermicelli, spring rolls & seasonal vegetable sauteed in garlic. We got the food in fairly short order. I was surprised at how quick we got it. It's not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but it's pretty good. Decent prices as well. Service was fast & courteous. The restaurant was relatively full, with only a few tables empty. It was clean & bright. Just a tad small for all the tables in there."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Restaurant doesn't really flash maybe because it's beside a grocery store, but you should try it there sometime. Price is cheap. Staff are nice."}
{"text":"Not bad at all... They give out coupons almost every time I eat there... Taste good... The only noodle soup I didn't like was the pork feet something... It was too spicy..."}
{"text":"This place is really a solid three stars and a half, but I have rounded down because the service is spotty - depending on who is serving you, and the non-pho meals drag down the grade.

The pho is very good and tasty, comes with a lot of noodles, a plate full of sprouts, mint leaves (?), and lime.  

I've seen from a lot of reviews that complain about not enough meat, but I find that it is a proportionate amount for pho.  It is not too little and just within the context of the soup meal. 

I've been here a number of times over this past winter (Brrrr!).  Yes, due to the unnaturally cold weather and have found the pho to be steaming hot, quickly served, flavourful, and satisfying.  In the end, I've had better pho, but there is nothing wrong with this one at all.

The weak part of the menu is everything else.  The pad thai is not the best I've had, and the non-soup meals are decently simple, but not disappointing.  It's okay and perfect for a fix; just that it could be better.

If they can boost the rest of the menu to match the very good pho, then I would add another star.

It would be nice to see Pho Vietnamese Delight up their game another notch.

END"}
{"text":"A-OK. 
Their pho is ok, lots of noodles, meat is fresh but sliced very thinly. My main complain is the broth, it is missing the flavor and is very dark, which means they do not parboil or roast the bones first and do not remove the scum in the final cooking, steps I would never miss when cooking at home, they help remove impurities and make broth crystal clean. However I like the variety of the condiments available and especially the home made chili sauce, which tastes very fresh and yummy, it alone keeps me coming back. Plus I don't get my usual MSG reaction when going to this place so they must use very little of it. Chicken wings as well as spring rolls were on the greasy side, and the lemon grass chicken was also very fatty as if they were using the American variety, chickens from Ontario are never that fat.
Overall I would recommend them for a quick and cheap lunch, especially if you're not watching your cholesterol levels."}
{"text":"I generally like the food here, but I'm not pleased with their coupon expiration dates. I order a lot when I eat here so I can take advantage of the coupons. But the coupon's expiration date is only one month.  It's not likely that I'll come every single month so I end up not being able to use them & wasted several already.  Sucks that they can't extend that date & make it more worthwhile for their customers. I don't think I'll bother with this coupon thing anymore - waste of time. I'll likely patron them less going forward for this bad business sense."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place. The broth was bland and the pork was over spiced."}
{"text":"Confortable and clean place with good and cheap food. I ordered a lemongrass chicken vermiceli for $6.99. You can choose water or tea to go with for free."}
{"text":"Pho Vietnamese Delight is an average pho place (diner?).  I ordered a small house pho.  The portion was big for a small.  I barely finished it. The noodle was nice, smooth and fresh. The broth was flavourful (MSG?). The meat was meh.  The services was adequate. Pho Vietnamese Delight is good for filling the stomach.  Come in with the right expectation, and you will do just fine."}
{"text":"Went for a third time. Food is good, service is fast and friendly. Not spectacular, but a good place for Vietnamese food (not just pho) if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is good! I kind of frequent them more than the Angus Pho place down the street and the 88 because the restaurant is a bit bigger and feels less cramped.

The only thing about all these Pho restaurants on Yonge St. is that you may have to pay for parking.

But let's get to the food... here, you'll find your traditional Pho restaurant items like the beef noodle soup, vermicelli, and rice... but there is also an extension to the list of various thai and Malaysian curries.

I was actually surprised they had such an extensive menu and that a Vietnamese Pho place had other cuisines as well.

I had the Malaysian beef brisket curry with noodles. I have to admit the curry was pretty good and the brisket was quite tender so overall I would recommend it (see photos).

The portion was large too and I was almost to a point where I was going to give in and doggy-bag it, but finished it all in the end.

This place is great, I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food: I had the small Thai shrimp rice noodle roll soup. The portion size was much bigger than I expected and for once I wasn't able to finish everything. It was pretty good and really spicy. If you can't handle spice, don't get it because it does leave a kind of spicy/burning sensation at the back of the throat. My mom got a cheap combo of fried rice and meat. The rice was good, flavourful with a nice addition of raisins to it. 

Ambience: Pretty spacious restaurant with enough room to have large and small groups of people. There's a TV in the corner for you to watch shows. 

Service: The waiters were fine, service was decent. We were quickly seated and our orders were taken. 

Lastly, we ended up spending over $30 so we got a coupon for free chicken wings the next time we come.

Overall, it's a decently priced pho restaurant with a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Idk why this place has shit reviews it's actually so good, I've been coming here for like 7 years!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I need a Pho fix.

Now there is not much difficult the what is required to keep this place in business.  The signature dish is obviously the House Pho Special.  Anybody that eats Pho understands that the star of the dish is the broth.  The broth typically is made for hours and sometimes days and at the end you have this you have an tasty broth.

Today, I ordered my special and I was very disappointed.  The broth was bland, boring and not a Pho broth.  I dont think I will be coming here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"There's a new Vietnamese restaurant in the Yonge and Finch neighbourhood.  It's a small franchise with their more popular and well known location on Don Mills.  This location has only been here for about 2-3 months and has been slowly making its name in the area.

Decided to check out their menu and tried them out for lunch. I went with the grilled chicken and spring roll vermicelli.  They have a couple of lunch specials priced at 6.99, which would offer additional items such as a hot and sour soup or a spring roll on the side.  Didn't feel like it and nothing on that lunch special menu stood out. The decor inside is nice and simple, but modern.  And you can still feel the \"newness\" of the restaurant, which is something I enjoyed.

My take out order only took about 5 mins from when I ordered to when it was ready, which was quite quick. While I was eating I couldn't help but compare it to another viet restaurant in the area, Wonderpho. I mean the similarities were all there. A quick and efficient service, the take out containers were the same and the grilled chicken in taste was quite similar. I mean there are some small subtle differences but funny just how similar they were. The grilled chicken in my opinion could have spent a little more time on the grill which did hurt its overall taste. The seasoning is a little less bold than Wonderpho's but still not bad. If you want a little more flavour then you probably would prefer Wonderpho. If you prefer to be just a little healthier and want that \"clean/simpler\" taste then you'll go for Delight. Delight also does give you a little more vegs with your order as well as chicken in that regard.

Overall, I would have to say Pho Vietnamese Delight is alright. The decor is much nicer than Wonderpho and if the food is quite similar why not go to the better looking restaurant. As well their menu does have a couple of more items.  If you're take out like me, not much difference at all in price or taste. So I guess the decision would fall simply what you feel for that day (extra seasoning or a simple/cleaner taste) and probably location.  My feeling is we'll end up with only 1 vietnamese restaurant for yonge and finch, we'll see which ones wins. If I have to choose one, I think it'll be this one."}
{"text":"Lots of Noodles in the pho; which is consequently missing a normal portion of meat. The service is extremely fast."}
{"text":"Their curry chicken is so good! One thing that bothered me was the amount of bones in the chicken. It would've been better if they used boneless chicken."}
{"text":"Typical, simple and quick dine and dash place to eat. Decent servings and fast service"}
