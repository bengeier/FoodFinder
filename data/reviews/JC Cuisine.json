{"text":"Very happy and satisfied!!!! I haven't order in Chinese in almost 4 years!!!! Afraid to take that leap in Vegas!!! No more worries for me!!! My number one to go to!!!! Try it guys you'll be very Happy"}
{"text":"Buyer beware I got food poisoning for 4 days since posting last /ordering review, had to call my bank due  to the rudeness of the staff. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"2 hours and no food, this place is garbage. Plenty of good Asian food in Las Vegas, don't bother with JC, they do not care."}
{"text":"Good service, great quality, I really like the fried rice there, the sushi roll shaky dog, it is awesome! Enjoy eating over there! Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, we had it delivered and we're happy for a small delivery charge at the time. Though it took an hour and a half to actually St our food. Had we known that, we'd have just ordered from somewhere else. Visiting from our of state, we just wanted food after our long hours of the day walking and exploring. The delivery driver was rude and insisted I had given them the wrong phone number because my phone didn't have service and he tried calling me (as we had instructed to call when arrived) the only thing I liked really was the price and the potstickers.. BBQ Pork was weird and not what we wanted, and the chow mein was weird tasting."}
{"text":"Good chinese food, the chicken is very crispy and fresh. They dont drown it in sauce like a lot of places. The chow mein tastes great and the fried rice is perfectly seasoned. Definitely one of the better chinese food places Ive been to! Would reccomend to friends. Dont know how the sushi is but the food is great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cashew lunch special - not only was it a large portion, but the ingredients we're so fresh and tasty that I hurt myself eating too much :)"}
{"text":"What we have here is a great Chinese restaurant with AWESOME lunch specials. I got General Tso, fried rice, chow mein, and egg drop soup all for $5.95. All arranged beautifully! Great tasting food at an even greater price."}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi experience ever. Wooo if you are a beginner in making sushi do not make sushi for selling it to others. Hire someone who knows what taste and true sushi making is. 

Poor mixture of Ingredents, spicy tune was not worth putting in the mouth. 

Please this is not a fair business practice. Everyones money is hard earned. We spend our moeny to eat outside where people love to make food for others and are creative and professional. Need to have some  quality control. 

Horrible taste, going to return the food."}
{"text":"7+ dollars from some horrible orange chicks.  Only went down because of the sause.   Chicken was dry and mostly bread.      Very lose cause the food is always good until today.  Normally it's meaty much and flavoryful.  Today it was dry orange flavoured bread.   Probably w9nt order that again. Not worth risking the loss in money."}
{"text":"Being next to a college campus, one might consider giving the taste of this restaurant's food a pass.  After all, it is a step up from Top Ramen, a staple in any college dorm pantry.   But is it really better?   Not at all. 

My entire hospital floor ordered a plethora of items off their menu.   Too much of the food we ordered were hit or miss.   In fact, throwing a dart, after being spun around and blindfolded, at a target 50 ft away would still result in hitting the mark more often than you would get something delicious and/or edible here.  

The egg flower soup- no good.   It starts bland, and finishes with a weird aftertaste in your mouth.  This is the opposite of enjoying a good wine tasting.  

Bbq spare ribs- Dry.  What it lacked in flavor it more than made up in the red food coloring it was doused in. 

Shrimp in lobster sauce- sub-average but decent sized shrimp and edible. 

Sesame chicken - Dry.  Hard.  You could not stick a metal fork through them if you tried.  If you manage to bite into one, you might discover a hint of sweetness to the chicken. 

Chow fun-  Not so fun if you ordered this. 

Teriyaki combo plate- I heard from co-workers that it was decent. 

Egg rolls, crab Rangoon-  Meh.  

I give them a star for being friendly over the phone and ordering was easy.   Being open until 4 am is helpful for us late night shift employees.  If only they were worth ordering from."}
{"text":"Sushi burrito was a huge let down. Definitely not worth $10z teriyaki combo was pretty cheap and sauce was way to heavy."}
{"text":"Stop selling sushi please. I ordered 2 rolls and was not happy. Very small pieces. Not worth the money. Had no flavor. Spicy tuna should have some type of kick but no not here. Customer service was good no complaints there being it was my first time. However the woman was prepping a container of 2 or 4 ounce sauces in the dining room when I walked in so that kinda made me wonder how else food may be prepped there. She didn't have gloves on and set the pan full of sauce on top of table in the open to be exposed with the ladle sticking out dripping. Would not come back here."}
{"text":"Thai ice tea is very delicious. It's on point. Good customer service. I'm from Cali and I hope joint is good...I will be coming here every time I visit Vegas!!!  #ComptonCa"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant the food was delicious and great value. Definitely try the shaggy dog roll and a great off the menu item was the JC special crunchy roll. Love this new restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is only mediocre. Edible on an empty stomach when they are they only Chinese restaurant open in the area at late night. Portions are a little small but not unreasonably so. Delivery time was good, but I ordered through Postmates, so I can't speak for their own delivery service. Sad that the best part was the pot stickers, which were pretty good, but the sauce was way too sweet. Sesame chicken was mostly breading, overcooked, and the sauce was weird and dry, and also way too sweet. Pork fried rice was alright, though it was odd that it had green beans and corn in it. Wish I could redo our coin flip and order pizza instead. We'll finish the meal but we won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Tried to order for delivery for tonight through GrubHub, was told that there was an additional $2 charge for the distance and an additional hour before my food would even be ready for delivery. That's fine, when I called to cancel the order, however, I was told \"we're downtown\" *click*
Whoever answered the phone, literally hung up on me when I was trying to cancel my order. I won't be ordering from them again, thank goodness for GrubHub, or there would be a very angry couple when the delivery man showed up and then an angry delivery guy who wouldn't have been paid for the trip."}
{"text":"I ordered the egg drop soup, saut√©ed vegetables, and honeydew slush boba through eat 24. The egg drop looked and tasted funny, to me it was inedible. The veggies were fine, but had a weird aftertaste. I did like the boba slush. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot for a lunch special! Food way better than Panda. They will do general tsos chicken for the same price.... super tasty"}
{"text":"I was nervous about ordering from here at first because of its 3 star rating, but after reading that most the negative reviews were about the sushi or people's orders taking too long, I went ahead and ordered (it was late and I didn't have many other options). I ordered through Postmates and the food was quick and on time. I got the family dinner A, and since I wanted Hunan Beef as an entree I called ahead to make sure they could do it since it wasnt listed as an option. They said it was ok and to just write \"+$2 and hunan beef\" in the notes, I also asked for extra sweet n sour and crispy wontons for my soup in the notes. Despite always being nervous about restaurants/Postmates missing the notes my order was 100% correct so I was def happy. All the food tasted like your basic Chinese food, the egg drop soup was better than most, but I'm still giving 4 stars because both my entrees were very dry with such a small amount of sauce on them. Had that problem been fixed I would have easily given 5 stars. Just know what you're getting into when you order late night Chinese, if you're expecting something gourmet this isn't the place, but for what I wanted at the time without leaving the house it worked out perfect for me."}
{"text":"Ordered General Tso's House Special Chicken and Beef Chow Mein Noodles for delivery. 

The food got hear really fast. Less than 45 minutes. But that's about the only good thing I can say about JC Cuisine. 

The General Tso's Chicken was dry and didn't taste fresh. If you've ever ordered a Chinese dish that's battered and fried like this you know the taste goes downhill fast if it sits out. 

This General Tso's Chicken tasted like it was sitting out before being delivered. 

The Beef Chow Mein Noodles were even more tragic...

They were flavorless. Even worse, the noodles were only half cooked. It was like chewing on thin strands of raw dough. 

There are a lot of good Chinese restaurants in Vegas so I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this establishment many times after mr. Beijing was temporarily closed. Every time I have ordered it has always been amazing, both good and service. However, tonight was a different story. The girl that answered the phone tonight barely spoke English, I get it, it's not your first language, however, when you work with the public......... Fast forward to an hour later when my good came, the order was correct but nothing tasted good. The orange chicken was bland and tasted off, the boba in my tea was HARD. I could barely chew it. I ordered can order of egg rolls (2) and an order of crab Rangoon (5)  they only gave me one sweet n sour sauce for the order. The container of rice was extremely small, when normally I could get three meals worth of rice in the container they usually give. To top it off my fortune cookie had no fortune, lol. This has b en the only time I have ever been displeased with this establishment. I will try them once more, hopefully it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"JC Cuisine is a very new Chinese restaurant in the very old shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway and Harmon Avenue across from UNLV. Always up for trying a new Chinese restaurant, being that I was in the area, JC Cuisine would be lunch. 

When I walked inside, I showed the woman at the register the Yelp Check-in offer for a complimentary drink. Going off subject for a sentence, I could create either a Yelp Talk thread or Yelp List on the greatest excuses that businesses give for incompliance with the Yelp Check-in offer. The excuse that the woman representing JC Cuisine gave is that the lunch special excludes the Check-in offer. I'm thinking this is not the end of the world. The bottomless fountain Pepsi is $1.55 or a can is $1. And most of all the Chinese lunch in special is one of the greatest deals around. 

JC Cuisine is a full-service Chinese restaurant that also offers take out. With that said, the woman at the cashier walked me to my table. She was friendly. That is a reason that I passed over a star deduction for Check-in offer incompliance. Wearing a friendly attitude she led me to a table in the back of the house that was away from the window. This was on a June afternoon during a heat advisory. From this point on she was my waitress and I was the sole dining patron. 

Perusing the lunch special menu, I observed that there is a $5.95 and $6.95 list. The later included shrimp based entrees. Proceeding this review, there is a picture of this very lunch menu. I decided on the pepper steak with onions. At $5.95, it included a bowl of egg drop soup followed by the entr√©e with fried rice, and soft chow mein noodles. Complimenting the waitress filled the glass of bottomless Pepsi. 

Now, I will discuss the food. The egg drop soup tasted average. However, there was a tasty touch of corn in the soup. A few minutes later, the waitress delivered the meal. It was a unique presentation. This is the first time that I remember seeing Chinese food presented in a long dish that had three portions. One of the pictures that proceed this review shows the left portion holding fried rice, the center holding pepper steak with onions, and the right portion holding soft chow mein noodles. Working off the fried rice on the left portion, the taste was agreeable. Close by, it was more enjoyable working off the pepper steak with onions. Both of them were tasty and the right temperature. However, when I worked off the soft chow mein noodles on the right side, my taste buds were like, \"This is filler and they've tasted better.\" Immediately I asked the waitress for hot sauce. She pointed to the bottle on the next table. I grabbed it then blanketed the soft chow mein noodles with it. This failed to blanket my opinion of the soft chow mein noodles. They were not warm. Considering that the fried rice and entr√©e were warm it was odd that the chow mein noodles weren't. Are they supposed to be not hot? Fortunately two out of the three items on the plate weren't bad. I agree with Meat Loaf's philosophy that two out of three ain't bad. Then again it ain't great. 

  The bill came out to $8.12 before the tip. After paying the bill, I left with the opinion that JC Cuisine is an average Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, the food is taking over an hour to get here even though the site says 20-30 minutes. The place is only 9 minutes from where we're staying so this is ridiculous. We're starving!! If you want your food in a timely manner then do NOT order here. Will update once food finally arrives. It is currently 11:55pm. We ordered at 10:30pm.."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. I think my favorite part was the serving size (huge portions). They should advertise that these portions are meant for multiple people. Oh man. Thought I could order a mapo tofu and some pork fried rice and have a California Roll on the side, I was wrong. Would definitely eat here again if it's still around when I come back."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place with quick service and great food at a great price then try this place out.   We started with hot and sour soup which was a very big portion.  My Uncle and I shared the bowl with was about two serving for each of us.  I got the Chicken chop suey which was excellent with lots of veggies and chicken.  Portions are a good size that you may need a take out box to enjoy later.  Also saw that they served sushi so next time Im in town, I'm gonna try it out!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have had in a long time. First it took over 2 hours for delivery, 2 miles on a Sunday afternoon. All the food was cold!! I don't mean luke warm, cold! The Chow Fun was a soggy miserable mess and flavorless.? The Curry Chicken was really soupy and almost no chicken.  NEVER AGAIN. Who has the nerve to serve this low quality food junk. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery, the girl on the phone was polite and helpful, she said 45 min but actually took one hour and 15 minutes. 
I had egg rolls (was good), spicy salmon sushi (4/10) and the chicken chop suey (10/10) 
I won't order delivery from them anymore, but I would go there to eat...."}
{"text":"The service was awesome! They were friendly. I tried the California roll and a few other sushi plates and they were quite good. Def coming back again"}
{"text":"Great service here, I am new in town and don't have my car with me yet, needed food and found JC cuisine , they got me a quick delivery and even put me ahead of a big far casino order because my apt is very close by, big thanks to them for helping me out, orange chicken was good , provide drinks and delivery service !!! Highly recommend especially for the price"}
{"text":"Ordered online through grubhub and it took forever, 2 hours. The management was nice enough to give me free egg rolls on my next order. The fried rice is good and the best price. The only thing I didn't like was the sushi it was bleh but the Chinese food was good and fairly priced"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place because I was in the mood for some quick food that wasn't pizza. Most of the reviews were not bad so I gave them a try. The deliver was on time. I ordered chicken teriyaki and veggie chowmein. The chicken was horrible Did even look appetizing so I didn't eat it. The rice and sauce however not bad. The chowmein has strange orange hue which i'm not custom to but I have seen these types of noodles. The chowmein despite the color was actually not bad and not too greasy. I even re-warmed it the next day and it still was good. Over all I wouldn't order from this place only because I've had better."}
