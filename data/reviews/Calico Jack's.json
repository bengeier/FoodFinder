{"text":"You know you're in trouble when you walk into a Mexican restaurant and there's ketchup on the table rather than hot sauce.  We went for some food at this lame ass joint (my gf had a gift certificate) and the place was totally empty during the lunch hour, but I admired the large screen tvs and access to nonstop ESPN in hi-def if you like that sort of thing.  But then it all went downhill.  The seats were uncomfortable.  The staff seemed confused by everything.  The food was abysmal.  If we could give less than one star, we would!

Let me describe in more detail: literally every bite of food was sub-par, and we ordered four courses.  The fancy quesadilla was literally a big basic tortilla with pre-shredded American cheese.  I could have done better at home easily.  The \"burro\" had some major problems--chewy meat, crispy tortilla in the wrong way (dry), and beans that will immediately send you into salt overload.  The flautas were so greasy and unappetizing that we just said no.  I've never seen her send food back in my life.  Dessert was lame.

Avoid this place at ALL cost. . Seriously Taco Bell will do you better.  Go to a real Mexican joint and boycott this monstrosity of \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"Years back I would always be here but went back and whoooa what a change and not in a good way :/Would give 0 stars but I can't. Horrible place to go.  Only go if you want your night to be ruined.  Rude people working there. They don't have manners they talk back to you. Very poor customer service was only their for 5 minutes. Guy working their was acting like he owned Westgate and said to go back to Phx. HAAAAA I live out west so kinda sad that they have people like this running this place."}
{"text":"First time here, didn't read reviews until sitting at the bar. Bartender was from the east coast and was polite an service was good. I only ordered the quesadillas and they were pretty good. Actually my only gripe was the darn fly that kept trying to share my meal."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to have a cheap drink before a show, this is it. Only spot that had a happy hour before the chili pepps. Bartenders were super friendly"}
{"text":"I went in last night with my family for Taco Tuesday and loved every minute of my dinner. $2 delicious tacos and great drink specials. We also ordered the mini chimis and nachos and both came out hot and tasted amazing. The drink menu was really interesting and creative, and the Margarita was perfect. My server was knowledgeable and attentive. I have zero complaints about this place and would recommend it to everyone, old and young!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the music here. By the time I get here I'm just ready to party and this place makes sure that happens. The DJ is great. He plays all the old school and new school."}
{"text":"As my dining companion said, \"never trust a place that charges for chips and salsa!\" Like most other folks who've reviewed this joint, we wound up here because of a Coyotes game. It should have been warning enough that there wasn't a wait to eat here but there was at every other establishment at Westgate. They were serving their much-maligned Event Menu which is truly food court food at resort prices. $5 for chips and salsa? Ridiculous! Between the three of us, there was a taco salad (which I was informed is less tasty than a taco salad served at particular hospital cafeteria in town), a sad veggie burrito and my sad steak burrito, replete with dry steak and missing guac and sour cream until I pointed out to the server.  It took a very long time to get our food, even though the restaurant appeared pretty dead. The server was friendly enough but not very skilled. For three entrees and NO beverages, our tab was nearly $50 before tip. Outrageous prices for subpar food. I agree with other reviewers: Taco Bell food at triple or quadruple the price. No thank you."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were standing at the bar for over 10 minutes for just a shot of liquor. Multiple bartenders passed by without even asking what we wanted we tried to flag them down without any success. How does a restaurant succeed with horrible customer service as this? We went across the way to McFadden's and got a shot within 5 minutes. Epic fail on calico Jack's part.

McFadden's just got $20 for 2 minutes of serving.

On another note if I could go negative Stars it would have been negative three."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE MONEY!!! The \"hostess\" was in short shorts and I thought she was a customer!! Service was slow and inadequate-we waited too long to GIVE our order. Then too long for check to get to us! I ordered the \"mini\" thingys and they were bland. The dipping sauce did help with taste. Hubby says wings were not cooked enough. He did bring them home so we can cook them more. Then there are no \"to go\" boxes and the rest of our (mediocre) wings had to be wrapped in tin foil. Tried to pay with Discover, nope, another minus!! The bartender WAS trying to help our server as he asked to bring more iced tea and HE checked on us couple times. The only reason we stopped is we were at the stadium for an event and Calico Jacks has Buzztime.  Sorry, not worth it. We'll go to our usual watering hole next time.

YOU SO NEED \"RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE\"!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before a concert and was seated right away. Then it took forever to get a server over for drinks and a food order. The server was MIA most of the time. Food was a little less than average. The decor was OK but seemed a little hard. With a name like Calico Jacks I expected caribbean with a pirate theme, not tex-mex and skull art. That's just my opinion and does not effect my rating. The manager looked like he hated everyone and was looking for a fight. The bright side is the bartender they had on that night was awesome. Fun, friendly and was a lot more helpful than our server."}
{"text":"Steak Fajita was awesome, played some beer pong, listened to live dj, and our server Katie was on point. Regretting not getting her number."}
{"text":"I received an unsolicited text message from this establishment."}
{"text":"Calicos is the spot to be at Westgate. The night life here is awesome. The ladies are everywhere. I definitely recommend trying this place out. You'll probably run into me here. Good drink specials and celebrity guests. Can't go wrong heading to Calicos."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but since this place was so TERRIBLE, I felt like a review was needed. Shortly after getting out of a football game across the street, our group walked in to what felt like 100 degree weather. There was no AC except for a couple ceiling fans; it felt as if I was actually eating my meal in Mexico... When we asked for chips and salsa, they were out of salsa and brought us guacamole instead, which they then charged us for without notice. Last but not least the chips were stale, the food was horrible!!!!!  the beer was hot, the service was AWEFUL and it cost about 90 dollars for three people to eat. I wish I could give this establishment -5 stars. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!! One star reviews are not harsh for this place at all. Chuck S. who made that statement, admitted he didn't try the food, but unfortunately we did. My girlfriend had the fish tacos which consisted of 2 deep fried and luke warm pieces of fish nuggets with a cold tortilla wrapped around each on a bed of raw cabbage. It came with pineapple salsa that had no taste whatsoever. It was accompanied by black beans with again absolutely no taste as if they had been spooned directly out of a can with no seasoning, and spanish rice again bland and cold. I had a burger that tasted as though it had been broiled that morning and held all day before serving. The bacon was undercooked and gross. When we got the check, we discovered that the waitress had added an \"included tip\" of 18% for a party of 2, which is appalling. The next morning we called to talk to management about all of this and were directed to a voice mail. We left a message and here it is a week later and we haven't received a call back.  So they really don't even care if people are dissatisfied with their food here and they are getting the horrible reviews that they are. Total bill for this car wreck of an experience was $73 for the fish tacos, 2 burgers, 2 margaritas, 1 coke, and tax, and aforementioned 18% tips. I would never recommend this horrible place to anyone!"}
{"text":"They advertise bike week pricing but they don't honor it. The place was empty but it still took 10 minutes to get a beer. Don't bother with this place there is a reason it's empty when all the other bars in the area are packed.  #falseadvertising"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for zero stars. They ran out of chicken and apparently every nacho ingredient. When our order came out, the nachos were smothered in ranch and jalapenos with a scoop of guac. It did not resemble the menu item aside from the chips. No silverware and we had to get our own napkins. By far the worst dining experience of all time. They did change the tv for me so thats a plus."}
{"text":"I stopped by this joint for a quick drink and regretted it. Service was so-so, the drinks where horrible, I sat at the bar and constantly kept smelling vomit, and um, did I mention they have roaches? One was on the bar, not sure if he was trying to pick up on me or what, but ya - ew!  P.S. the girl's bathroom stalls - I don't think they've ever been wiped down. This place needs to close and clean up."}
{"text":"I went there with my husband last night,  Saturday, may 15th. The restaurant ambiance is totally cool! Great southwest , mexican decor. After we were seated, we ordered a beer & a margarita. They finally arrived about 10- 15 minutes later! We had been enjoying their great salsa & chips, figuring we were really going to like this place!
   The menu is pretty limited. We ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup & the beef fajitas to share. I was not famished,  and figured there would be plenty. 
    Now, they came out together, which was okay, since we were sharing. But, they brought a cup of soup instead of a bowl. That cup of soup cost $4.99, and was smaller than a small coffee cup! Neither of us liked it, either.  The fajitas that were supposed to come sizzling were just warm, and the meat was dried and cooked pretty well. The meat would have actually been good if cooked right. The portion was very small, and the tortillas that came to wrap the food in, were about the size of a drink coaster!! Also, I was pretty bummed that my margarita had absolutely no alchohol in it. 
      The server was really nice, but we will not go back there."}
{"text":"The food was bland and the service was an \"I don't want to be here attitude\". We will not go back. I ordered fajitas and the steak was already cubed (no sizzle at all) it did not come with lettuce, cheese, or sour cream, only rice and beans."}
{"text":"Would never go there again. Went to lunch there food was not good then a roach comes across the table yuk! Never ever again."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour. No happy hour on event days. We are from out of town and didn't know there was a event. Not there fault but they had what they called a \" event menu'\" what a ripoff a limited menu that the prices were jacked way up. We had nachos , quesadilla and 2 beers $50.  Food was average at best and way way over priced. 2 appetizers and 2 beers for $50 that is insane!"}
{"text":"Over priced food that isn't any better than a taco bell. Drinks more expensive than the hockey arena next door. Do yourself a very big favor and stay far away from here or join the ever growing list of disappointed reviewers on yelp regarding this place"}
{"text":"Oh my...one word terrible. Went to Calico jacks on Mother's day. First, the service was horrible. It's like the waitress didn't want to work. No drink refills, no one even came to check on us. For all they know we could have left and they wouldn't haven't cared. Second, food was terrible, no flavor. Last the drinks, if I order a drink and you don't have the mixing ingredients, don't try to make something just come tell me. Drinks were horrible. Will not go back. If I was the owner I would fire everyone and start over."}
{"text":"Calico Jacks has VERY GOOD FOOD...the salads and Burritos, the Desserts & their signature burger is AWESOME! Along w/ the Service they give. I would recommend them to anyone who loves good Mexican food w/ nothing but THE BEST service!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in west gate. Much better than Salt. I am a Native Az too. This taste like Mexican food should to me having had grown up eating it living in Az. The reason only 4 stars furthest from The Arena. Takes a few more minutes to walk"}
{"text":"Taco Bell or frozen dinner would put this place to shame. Cold food bad service! I wish I could give no stars."}
{"text":"Should be zero stars. Way overpriced for the terrible quality of food. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Best place to go too. I always go with my girl friends and I never have a bad service again people are friendly but sometimes you'll have some people get into a fight, but all in all I like it :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star experience  at the bar. I went with my girlfriend twice to this place during happy hour and we definitely both left happy each  time. We favor the $3  margaritas special. Great service, clean place, and good pricing.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience with the staff there and the food lets just say there is lots of room for improvement. Very disappointed, decently not going back."}
{"text":"My sister and I were in town for the Packers-Cardinals game.  We found this place looking for a place to have breakfast.  I can't comment on the food because they had a limited menu on game day and we didn't like any of the options.  The only reason I'm even writing a review (this is the first Yelp review I've ever written) is because I wanted to commend the service we received from the bartender, Isabel.  She deserves 5+ stars.  She was very, very friendly and made us feel as if this was our local bar. She felt really bad about the menu options (as if it was her fault).  She makes a great drink.  If I'm ever back in Glendale, I would stop in just to see her."}
{"text":"Been to Calico Jack's three times; first time service was very good; all we had was drinks. Second time, service was bad- food horrible. Decided to go a third time Tuesday April 12th at 1:30 PM, service was absolutely attrocious. We ordered two margaritas, tasted like margarita mix only (no alcohol); when questioned to bartender she tried to give a history of Tres Generacions Tequila and how mix is made; gave us an additional shot (essentially a quick splash into our drink). After we decided to leave low and behold we were charged $2 a piece for the so called shot. Did we leave a tip? HECK NA- WE WILL NEVER GO AGAIN! We will tip very well for good service- this place is terrible when it comes to service- TERRIBLE! I absolutely do not reccomend Calico Jacks. Check out Marc's on 43 Ave & Peoria; service is great; drinks and food are very good; price is reasonable!"}
{"text":"Prior to the Sharks/Coyotes game, my friends and I decided to hang out here for drinks and food.  We set up shop at the outside bar. 

I decided a margarita sounded good. The margaritas was average at best. The flavor just wasn't there and tasted too much like a mix. I then went to beer.

We ordered wings and taquitos. This food was pretty good.  Watch out for the habanero wings.

Two friends and I then decided to order nachos with chicken. That was a MISTAKE!  The nachos weren't very good, had about 2 wings worth of chicken if that and had very little cheese, beans etc. I can't believe I wasted $11 on that. Some of the worst nachos I've ever had. Steer clear of that item.

The bartender was friendly and was very attentive to our needs.

Decent place, but maybe some of the other locations at Westgate are better?"}
{"text":"Should've left when I first walked in. It smelled dusty in there. We were meeting some friends for happy hour and didn't want to be rude.  When we sat down there was a layer of dust just sitting on top of the table. It was like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks. The bar top was dusty. The food was nasty. Their house margarita was ok. Nothing like trying to drink a cols beer out of a plastic cup  where am I a house party?  If you don't have to go here do go out of your way to do so."}
{"text":"Went here on 7-29-11....since this was my first date night out with my hubby in over a year we decided t hat we wanted to go to a club/bar.
We did not eat here so I can't give a review about that.
We had alot of fun dancing. Music was pretty good and people were pretty friendly. We got there early. We arrived around 7: 30 pm and there was a guy and his guitar....he was pretty good. After 10 pm they clear tables for a dance floor. I was having a great time until some of the bartenders got on top of the bar and started dancing on it! I mean if that's your kind of thing then this is the place for you! I for one am a little on the jealous side so I was definitely not feeling this place because of that! If you are gonna have girls dancing on the bars with their asses  hanging out, at least have some eye candy for me!!! 
I only gave this place three stars because the dance floor is kind of small and I didn't like the girls dancing on top of the bar with their asses in my face!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I can remember eating and/or paying...hoping somebody that runs this place is aware of how terribly bad they are...we seriously debated walking out on our 90$ bill because first of all 3 ppl 90$ is f*#king ridiculous for the food they served and because our server could not have been more worthless...this establishment is a JOKE"}
{"text":"This place is so getto.. Charging  5 $ cover only for guys.. Girl  upfront didnt even reconize i was standing in line.. She was to busy talking to her freind...  I would not go here poepme ate rude..."}
{"text":"The place was empty on a lazy Saturday afternoon. The food was good. Ordered a Jack's Famous burger. It was simply a burger. No seasoning or flavor of any kind. Potato wedges were decent. The food came out hot. Enjoyed two brews. 

Overall not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Can I give lower than 1 star?  Calico Jack's was featured on Fox 10 News so we figured we would give it a try.  My wife ordered the carnitas burrito and I had the don flautas.  Disgusting.  Worst meal for both of us that we have had in a long, long time.  The service was slightly below average.  The atmosphere is nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"Living social had a deal for Calico Jacks, so I thought I would head down for a nice Sunday afternoon lunch.  Upon arrival I walked in through the front door to find no one to greet or direct, so I made my way to a booth near the bar and started watching some TV.  After a few minutes the bartender comes out and provides a menu and takes my drink order.  

I ordered the chips and salsa appetizer and the chicken fajitas.  While the chips and salsa never found their way to the table, the fajitas did arrive sizzling and smoking on the usual cast iron skillet and came with the usual fixings.  The presentation was a little cluttered with a separate dish for rice, beans, sour cream, and tortillas.  Besides the \"rustic\" cuts of gigantic bell pepper chunks, the food was cooked well and tasted like a mediocre fajita.  I ordered the fried ice cream for dessert and it came out quickly, about 5 minutes.  It was tasty and much better than the main course.

My whole experience took roughly an hour and the service was definitely lacking.  The gentleman serving my table was the only employee I ever saw the whole time.  He was serving all occupied tables while serving the bar and could have definitely used some help.  His service was great, he just can only do so much on his own, so my drink sat empty for awhile a few times and I never got my appetizer because they were understaffed."}
{"text":"If I could give this place an effin zero I would. This is my second post in 2 and a half years and there hasn't been the slightest of improvements. I was having a blue moon at the outside bar and the bartender tells me I can't have glass on the patio. So I tell her to give me a plastic cup that's at the end of the bar. How ingenious is that ish? Because I have insulted her intelligence,  she calls security. Im so happy to be blessed with common sense. Unlike the aholes at this place. Smh in disgust..."}
{"text":"If there were an option for zero stars this place would earn it. Although our server was really nice so I guess one star goes to her. The food was horrible!!! Small cold portions that are extremely over priced- how can you mess up Mexican food this badly!?!? The only \"decent\" food was off the kids menu. Advice to the restaurant- just be a bar, don't serve food."}
{"text":"We went to Calico Jack's after a ball game on a Sunday night.  I was unimpressed with the service and disgusted by the management (I'll explain in a minute).  

First of all, they put us at a table next to stairs that the wait staff used constantly.  Every time a waitress wanted to walk by, my husband had to scoot his chair in so that he was litterally pressed up to the table.  Our $9.00 patron shots were delivered, but without the limes we requested.  We asked our waitress 3 times before she finally remembered some limes.  At one point, I actually had to go to the bar to get a drink because our waitress was nowhere to be found.  

I ordered 2 drinks at the bar and asked the bartender to close the tab on my debit card.  We waited for a few minutes before the bartended finally walked by again.  He looked at me confused, and I reminded him that I wanted my tab closed.  He went back and retrieved my card.  I still left a good tip on my balance, and we had our drink and left.

A few days later, I noticed I'd been double charged on my debit card: once for the amount of the drinks and once for the amount of the drinks plus the tip.  The charges were hard posted (not going to fall off like they sometimes do), so I called Calico Jack's and left a message for the manager.  When he didn't return my call, I called back and asked to speak to him in person.  I explained the situation and said he'd \"look into it.\"  Wow, was he annoyed... no apology, nothing.  After not hearing from him for 5 days, I was about to file a fraud claim through my bank.  I checked my account first and noticed the $18.00 had been refunded, so I didn't have to.  

It's disgusting cusotmer service-especially from a manager, in my opinion, that he didn't call to apologize or even to tell me that he'd processed the credit.  

I was unimpressed from the beginning, but this interaction with the manager of all people showed me that the only thing Calico Jack's cares about is the bottom line... they could care less about the customers they serve.  Booo."}
{"text":"Ricardo/jeorge was our bartender and server. He was awesome, helped us with suggestions and gave a reason to come back tomorrow(sunday) for the bloody mary bar. Music wasn't too loud for lunch. Oh.... and AMAZING food."}
{"text":"NHL hockey night at Jobing.com arena means restaurants are doing crazy business.   With added patrons one would expect management to increased staffing   I've been to a couple of the arena area restaurants in the daytime and they are empty. So, if it's football or hockey there will be a lot of people so be a manager 

I probably would give it a 3 but the service was slow because they were  understaffed.  Draft Coors light not very cold.  Food was forgettable , which means average.  But the main reason I will eschew this place was the restroom attendant.  It is a small bathroom, real small.  It was creepy, very creepy.  Female friend said same in the ladies room.  I've been in really nice expensive restaurants with huge bathrooms with attendants.      I still think needing someone to have to hand you a paper towel is superfluous anywhere.  But at Calico  Jacks  it was worse than superfluous, it was pretentious. I will go back to the Saddlehouse where they trust you to pee without a supervisor."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff, and good food. I had the quesadilla since I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend had the Jack burger, which he said was the best he had in a long time. We came because we were going to a hockey game next door. Would have gave them 4-5 stars, but they didn't accept the coupon we had that came with our hockey tickets, which is the whole reason we came here. Not coming back because we don't live close, so the coupon was worthless. Not the waitresses fault, so we just paid for it."}
{"text":"Went here before the Sam Smith concert at the stadium. Server was nice holy crap the food was terrible. I ordered a burrito and my friend ordered a salad, and they both came out uncomfortably fast. The chicken in my burrito tasted like it was marinated in soy sauce. Wtf. This is a Mexican restaurant. Use chili powder or something.

This is easily the worst Mexican food I've had in Arizona.

Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I attended a retirement party here on May 21, 2010, and have a mixed review.

The wait staff and bus staff were excellent - firendly, courteous and prompt.  The $2.00 happy hour margaritas were an excellent value and the complimentary tortilla chips and salsa were plentiful.

The happy hour appetizers were a bit pricey at $5.00 and the entrees all seemed overpriced.

The quemada \"burnt\" salsa was terrible.  No one in my group liked it.

If I go there again it will be margaritas and chips/salsa only for me."}
{"text":"a bunch of us friends came to calico's for a night out , even mix of gals and guys. When we came to the door to get in they didn't let a friend in because his boots were Timberland and the security told us those were \"gangster\" boots. WTF who says that really, they did not allow my friend in so in turn all 12 of us left to saddle ranch where we spent our money ,and had an awesome time. Stereotyping is what happens at Calico jacks....shame on you..."}
{"text":"I give this place one star because it wasn't the absolute worst restaurant experience I've had. The bartender was cordial at least, once he realized we existed. We came in tonight , New Year's Eve and entered right as it was clearing out.  Ie: most had gotten or were finished with their meals.  They were not busy and being directly across from jobing.com, they should be prepared for game nights and new years.  (Having worked at a restaurant next to a sporting arena, I am aware of how this works.) Long story short, 1 order of not good chicken tacos took a half hour, our taquitos were completely forgotten, the employees were wandering around on their cell phones; that's if you can tell who works there, as they all wear street clothes. These people either don't know what they're doing, or they don't care because they're guaranteed business when all the edible places are busy.  I will never go here again and dissuade anyone I know to do so either."}
{"text":"Service was poor, and all orders came out wrong..I can deal with that but the menu is selection is small, they only provide a few items and \"was out of chicken\" really you serve 6 items and can't even keep enough on hand?"}
{"text":"GOT VOUCHER ? too bad , you lose
 
We attempted to visited this place numerous time. Each time we were told the \"event menu\"  was the only menu available because of an event that day. Even though the event was 8-10 hours in the future, they still used the event menu. Went there on a day with NO events at Westgate..... still using the event menu. This menu consists of \"food court\" type snacks.
 
It took numerous calls to get the truth : they no longer have a full menu !!!   But they continue to sell dinner deal vouchers on sites like KGB Deals. When the General Manger (Bill Walsh) was confronted, he became verbally abusive and refused to honor the coupons for ANYTHING..... 
 
You have choices when going to Westgate...save yourself the grief.... Maragritaville is right next door !"}
{"text":"Went to Calico Jack with some friends. The Margaritas were horrible the beer was warm. We only had cocktail we paid (it was happy hour) for our drinks and left them there full. We would not go back  again. Calico Jack Hot beer and Arizona doesn't mix."}
{"text":"Service was slow even though there wasn't a crowd. Food was mediocre and more expensive than it seemed worth. You don't get chips and salsa with your meal, had to pay $5 but the salsa was good and had a nice kick.  Probably the best thing about our meal."}
{"text":"Me, my wife and 2 friends are going to the Cardinals vs Charger game so I was not expecting the service to be the best due to the line and proposed wait time at every restaurant in the Westgate complex, BUT the service was soooo bad that it there was a rating lower than 1 star this place would get it. 

So after waiting in line to put our name in to get a table (normal).... the people in front of us get told its an hour wait for a party of 2 (normal)... The person ask how many in our party, I respond 4, and they say 30 minutes (not normal)... How can you sit a larger party 30 minutes before you can sit a smaller party? If I had 6 could we get in sooner because I would have made 2 new friends with the people in front of me.... 

We get a text (which is a nice feature instead of carrying around the vibrating coaster), and go to get our table where we were seated promptly, and it was clean. From this point on it was pretty much a disaster. 

I ordered a Tijuana burger, my wife ordered a casadilla, and our friends ordered some nachos. This normal bar food should be a piece of cake to cook. Not so... After 15 minutes the waitress (who was dressed like a patron with no identification that she actually worked there), comes back to the table and says they are out of chips for the nachos.... WTF... YOU ARE A MEXICAN CANTINA!! HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF CHIPS?!!! 15 minutes later we see food coming out of the kitchen with chips....We are a little annoyed at this point. We have also waited 30 minutes so far and have only received our drinks..... 

The waitress comes back to check on us and tells us our food will be there soon... 
10 minutes later she comes back to check on us again and says our food will be there soon again. If you are a keeping score we have now waited 40 minutes and have no food. At this point its 20 minutes to kick off and the bar has emptied out. I can understand a wait when you are packed, but now the place is a ghost town. I ask the waitress how much longer, please give me a time... She said ANOTHER 20 Minutes... 

So now it takes an hour to make a burger, nachos, and casadilla? The manager never came out to apologize... Maybe give us a drink coupon to come back after the game, or maybe just comp the 1 round of draft beer we had consumed in the 40 minutes we were waiting to get our food. We paid for our drinks and got food at the stadium. 

Just because you are busy on game day does not mean that you get to give crappy service. I have never heard anyone say.... \"I'm surprised that place went out of business, they had such great service\"... This will be our last choice on game day or any other time I am at Westgate."}
{"text":"Both  flavors of margaritas I tried, Strawberry & Mango were the worst I've ever had anywhere!! They tasted like powdered margarita mix was used if that's even possible.  The chicken chimis I had were very bland, gross & didn't come with any kind of garnish or cheese. This was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"One of my friends birthdays is this weekend so last night me and 5 others went to the Coyotes/Sharks game to have some fun. The birthday boy chose this place for his birthday dinner. Here were the problems we encountered during our time:

1. Our server was Chloe and she did not even come to greet us for a solid 10-15 minutes.
2. Once she took our drink order (5 waters and 4 alcoholic drinks) it took about 15 minutes for those to be delivered. 
3. My boyfriend and I ordered chips and salsa and guac which ended up be $10 in total... just for chips and salsa and guac. The chips were not even that good
4. Our food took a while to come out, which would be okay if the place was busy, but it wasn't. We were the third party to be sat in the restaurant. 
5. One couple ordered the nachos and they said it was delicious, another person ordered the Calico Chicken Sandwich which he said was good, and the last ordered wings which he ate all. I ordered the fajitas which were pretty decent except for the fact that they gave me flour tortillas (I asked for corn) and didn't notice until I took a bite. I am allergic to wheat.
6. Our waitress did not stop to check on us at all and when two people wanted to order another drink, one asked for theirs and then she walked away so fast before the other could ask for theirs. Service was not good.
7. When we wanted our checks, we asked her for them but before we could tell her how to split them she walked away. When she came back after 10 minutes with the one check, it took her about 10 more minutes just to split it.
8. The cherry on top was as we were waiting for our checks, a cockroach crawled across our table.

Would definitely never go back and highly recommend to choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here prior to the Cards v Broncos game w/ my daughter.  She has not eaten at Bitzee Mama's, so this is her least favorite Mexican restaurant in Glendale.  Bitzee's is still mine.

First, I've been programmed to the free chips n salsa basket at most Mexican restaurants.  Odd that there was none here and it was not listed as a menu item either.  Options appear to be nachos or a layered dip. 

We ordered the shrimp ceviche which is marinated in lemon, garlic, the chef's spices...it was very bland.  I think the Chef left out the spices.  It wasn't the only thing he left out.  He left stuff out of my burro.  We didn't finish the ceviche.

The daughter got the tortilla soup and did not like it at all. She wanted to give them her grandmother's phone number to call for a good recipe.  I tried it and it was okay.  Tested kinda like watered down queso.  We didn't finish the soup.

My burro was missing its key ingredients of sour cream, guacamole and oaxaca cheese and the drizzled sour cream on top.  That should have been the first clue to the waitress that something was up w/ the dish.  Plus it wasn't chimi-style like I ordered.  Rather than send it back to have it fried, I decided only to say something when the bill came if I was charged for chimi-style...I was not.  W/o the cheese, I had more of diet burro, so I guess it was okay cause I saved calories for later.   I saved more calories eating only 1/2 the burro.  

Haven't tried the Irish pub yet that went in where the Fox Sports Grill is.  Places to go prior to games remain in preference order:  The Yardhouse, Saddle Ranch, Native New Yorker.

The place was not busy...it picked up the closer it got to noon.  This is 3 hours before kick-off.  I don't think diners are lining up to get inside here like they do The Yardhouse.

********************
UPDATE:  5/14/2011
Sometimes I like to look back on my Methinks not reviews to see what other diners are saying after my visit.  I'm amazed Jack's is still opened.  To be in the Westgate, which sees probably meh traffic when there is no event, and then not be busy when an event takes place, how do you stay open??   Based on my experience at Bitzee's Mama and other diner reviews on that restaurant, I can only surmise that the offerings for Mexican in Glendale are so slim that its citizens are very forgiving."}
{"text":"Dropped by Calico Jack's after tonight's Red Wings victory in Game 3 to kill time and let traffic thin.  Scanned the area and decided to give these folks our business.  We got inside where a total of maybe 5 or 6 other people were eating and drinking.

We took a seat and waited far too long for service for such an empty place.  Once we were served the folks were friendly enough and I was high on Red Wings victory so I let it slide.

Then we ordered...

Ordered the quesadillas and two beers (Tecate).  First our beer arrived...in cans.  I've never been served beer in a can unless it was PBR and even then we were told up front it was in a can.  Okay, I can live with that.

Then the quesadillas arrived.  They were no better than Taco Bell and probably triple the cost.  I expect to get gouged a bit at a restaurant just outside an arena but this was ridiculous.

Tonight was the first and last time I will visit Calico Jack's.  For the prices charged the food has to be superior to edible for me to even think of returning."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.

Their website and the posters and promotional material IN THEIR BAR promote drink specials (Wednesday - $1 drafts, $2 margaritas) - yet they don't honor them at the bar.  They give you a long story about how they can't change the promotional material in their own bathroom.

The food is bad.  The service is just okay.  It's always dead. 

There is no reason, with places like Saddle Back across the street, to go here.

Go someplace good that actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"4 of us went there last night before The Who concert.  I'm giving it 1 Star only because of it's great location next to the arena....OMG where do I start?  We had to flag our waiter or someone else down about 5 times...he would disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time.  The $13 burrito wasn't half as good as $5 burritos you can get on Van Buren.
We go out @ 5 times per week so you have to be pretty bad to have earned \"My Worst Dining Experience This Year Award!\"

Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"This place got very poor reviews but I had a decent experience.  Really a two star place that gets an extra because of the coupon.

The bartender was the only one on staff (Monday at lunch).  She didn't really know how to bar-tend, but was nice.  We had two beers each and an order of their nachos with carne asada, which was better than most.  I prefer cheese sauce (like queso dip) on top of Nachos rather than melted cheese which gets hard and cold pretty much immediately).  Pretty darn spicy too, which is a good thing

The total bill was $36.  Too expensive for the surroundings BUT, restaurant.com has a gift cert.  You buy the cert for like $3 and it is good for $25 off if you spend $35.  Good part is that it includes booze.

SO, our bill was only $11 (still tipped on $36, of course).

I won't be back without a coupon, but with one, this place is A-OK."}
{"text":"I always get restaurant.com certificates to go here, and I don't mind the food, but the issue with it is that they go to the extreme when considering the average American's tastes.  They don't take any risks by putting any real Mexican flair into the food, so it all ends up rather bland by comparison.  

The upside is that little kids will eat it, because it's not spicy at all.  If you know people who usually won't eat Mexican food because they complain it's all too spicy or gives them heartburn or whatever, take them here, because this will be right up their alley.  It's like if someone who is used to cooking traditional English food tried to cook their first Mexican meal.  Even the poblano cream sauce, which sounds like it would have some \"oomph,\" had no real zip to it.

Service is always great and friendly. So don't take the 2 stars as a discouragement, because there is definitely a market for the type of food they serve, and of course they have big TVs for sports and lots of booze, so there's always that...and any of the \"Mexican\" food they serve would be fine as a bar appetizer."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Went here on a Sunday after the football game and could not believe what I quickly encountered. No A/C inside, ground fans hanging from the ceiling by rope, and really bad service. When you go to a Mexican cantina you are usually in the mood for chips and salsa, well not here!!!! On a SUNDAY, which has a cardinals and coyotes game going on, they ran out of salsa!!!!! How that's even possible, beats me! Room temperature beers, horrible service, hot, and really bad food! Tasted like it was microwaved and thrown onto a plate. I remember meals in grade school from my crack head cafeteria lady tasting better then this. And to add salt to the wound, for 3 of us, it was $90!!! Please don't eat here, this place needs to be done away with!"}
{"text":"The restaurant had a special event menu last night because of the Justin Bieber concert. If you want to do a special shortened menu, the items being offered should be good. OUr table of 6 ordered the nachos, quesadillas and burgers. All of them were cold, plain, poor ingredients and overall bad. Did I mention they seemed to out special prices on their \"event\" menu.  A small, yucky burger $11.49, a really small quesadilla (four pieces) $9.99 and cold, gross nachos- $11.99. And the topper was a bottle of beer- $7. The one star is given to the server. She was friendly and attentive. No wonder it was the only place not booming with business."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday party. A lingering layer of stickiness coats everything. Bar staff over serves people and when they finally hit their tipping point, kick them out, literally onto the curb behind the bar. I don't drink, so I witnessed it happen 2 times while  I was there. Restroom attendenent was pushy and crowded the already tiny restroom. The birthday girl enjoyed their drink card."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for a better customer service review than with Isabel Hurtado. Great bartender"}
{"text":"I can not say enough about avoiding this place. The food is over priced and it's not even good. The staff is socializing out in front more than waiting on people. The music is heavy metal and too loud. You're better off at yard house. At least there you get some value for your dollar."}
{"text":"I've been reading the reviews about this place and I can somewhat understand the judgments about it but my friend and that came through to this spot over at the Westgate Mall had a good experience.

I was in the mood for Tex-Mex so we pretty much settled for Calico's. Definitely was not crowded here, hence probably because of the reviews it has received. Good points about Calico Jack's: despite the lack of waiters here the service was very g ood from the waitress we had. My friend had a chicken burrito while I had a shrimp burrito. Added to that I requested a pomegranate margarita and I don't remember how the convo came about for some pineapple mix to be added to it but the waitress did that for me as well. EVERYTHING came out great. The shrimps in the burrito were huge and fresh. I have no complaints at all about the food nor the service.

If I have anything negative to say about Calico's is that they do need a bigger staff eventhough there was not a huge crowd in the restaurant. But it was a Saturday and it was nice so it should be beyond necessary for there to be more than one or two waiters attending to patrons. Also some updated furniture would do the place justice. Other than that not really anything bad to say about Calico Jack's."}
{"text":"This place is DISGUSTING!!! My boyfriend and I wanted to go there before the kings game last night and when we ordered drinks we saw at least 4 roaches! NOT only was the service horrible but theres ROACHES TOO!?!?!?! Why is this place still open? Only reason my post has one star is because it wouldnt let me post zero."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant out because we got a smokin' deal from Restaurants.com.  It was a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty.  We were asked if we wanted to sit on the patio, which we declined because the Non-Smoking Patio is immediately adjacent to a smoking bar.  Um... smoke travels and so the patio was out.  

We were seated in the 'dining' area.  The music was very loud, so the reviews that this was a good place for kids, not so much.  If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.  Not to mention that considering the decor and the number of cowboy hats in the room, the hard rock/heavy metal was sharply out of place.

We were immediately greeted by our waitress who took our drink order.  She brought the drinks out fast and took our food order.  My husband and I both got the carnitas burrito and my in-laws got the chicken tortas.  The waitress promptly brought us some chips and salsa.  Which tasted horrible.  The chips were too thick and were bland.

Once the food arrived it looked good.  Which made the taste all the more disappointing.  While my pork was tender, it was bland.  The sauted peppers were completely raw and not cooked at all. The refried black beans were unseasoned and very bland as well.  The rice was 'eh'. Nothing special.  My in-laws said the tortas were very dry and had to ask for more sauce.  The bread for the torta was supposedly toasted, however there was no indication that it was actually toasted. 

We ordered chicken strips for the kids which were decent, but considering they were dripping with oil, not too healthy. There was so much oil that the breading slid off the chicken.

Over all the meal was extremely disappointing. The service was prompt and our server was very nice but unfortunately we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Service was slow didn't get order right, towards end of meal husband had a cockroach crawl up his leg, part of our meal was taken off but had to wait to long for manager to fix situation  and never got an apology"}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in a very long time.  The restaurant was empty on a Saturday night at 6 pm and I think there's a reason.  We both had the tacos (carnitas and mahi) and they were both served cold.  The mahi itself was a little warm, like it had just been cooked, but the carnitas felt and tasted like it had come out of the fridge.  The tortillas were cold and hard.  Rice and beans were at best room temperature.  Wash this down with $6 beers?

I'm sure this place relies on events at the local arenas for it's business and since there was nothing going on it put forth a half-assed attempt.

Would not return."}
{"text":"Great service, lousy nachos.  I got a giant pile of chips and raw onion.  Scant \"cheese\" and what little meat there was was tough and grisly. This is Arizona, there is no excuse for such lousy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Why please with all the amazing Baja style street taco amazing places would this place be here still!!!! This is not Mexican food it's crap on a plate , water salsa, old soggy chips. I want to go back and help the chef in the back if you can't make salsa ..PLEASE don't open a Mexican restaurant. ..this place will close! Super bowel around corner get your shit together!"}
{"text":"First time going here before the Coyotes game.  Service was decent, however the food was terrible and overpriced.  Worst mexican food I've ever had.  Also there was a golf video game next to our table that was randomly making noise.  Asked about turning it off or down and they said there was nothing they could do.  Didn't offer to move us or anything.  Not going back here."}
{"text":"Walked out after 4 minutes. Sat us at a dirty table.  Asked for a drink menu and they didn't have one. Went to the restroom and it was horribly dirty.  Place was empty while all other restaurants were packed.  Food options were very limited and over priced.  Menu not customer friendly starting you have to pay a minimum price per person.  

Said they are revamping the drink menu but I'd say you need to revamp the entire place...tear it down and start over..."}
{"text":"went to this bar on a Saturday afternoon maybe 2p -3pm, doors was open but no staff to greet you we sat down anywhere and then it took 15 minutes before some one from the back came to greet us, looks like it was the dishwasher since the waiter came out 15 minutes later and seem annoyed, he didnt greet or try to entice us on the menu just came lean on the next chair arm rest and said you ready? never been to this restaurant before but he didnt care or ask, then I had some coupons from my employer to use which cleary said complementary appetizer with entrée well he look at them and said nope only one coupon and gave it back very rudely,  didnt even say let me check nothing, well food came out about 20 minutes later like it was something warmed out from yesterday tacos carne asada and it was nothing special.  didnt come to check on us or ask how was everything, came one time for refills and then brough the check after I ask him because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes before he came back. 
I will go back maybe on a friday night or evening late when full staff is there and see if this is only one of those one bad apple in the basket spoiling it for the rest. If this was the manager they need to get it together, but if this is the way customer service is done when the boss is not around this is bad."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Salsa had zero flavor. Waited almost a hour for our food. Wasn't busy. Never coming back. Sad day cuz the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Was there for St Patty's day early dinner, Nachos were terrible! Mexican restaurant and terrible nachos ??...doesn't make sense! Was empty on drinks several times, had to ask for everything, didn't know the waitresses name, enchilada sauce was yuk compared to most Mexican food places. My guess is that theryre only succeeding cuz of the location, rather than the referrals and good food.... Too bad. Won't go there again or will I refer !"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple--this is the poorest excuse for a Mexican restaurant in which I have dined.  The place was empty when the courtyard was overfilled with people, and thus I had my suspicions upon walking in because of that.  The nachos hardly have any cheese on them.  They do not serve hard-shell tacos!! but soft shell only that they claim they can crisp up!  The portions of meat on the tacos were so scant, it was hard to believe they were tacos.  This place won't be in business for long, so this review will be moot.  But until they close, stay away.  There is another Mexican Restaurant within the same complex if you must have Mexican food."}
{"text":"New very limited menu. No free chips and salsa and the server told us she knew nothing at all about what kind of margaritas they had as she'd never tried any of them. I didn't ask her if she'd tasted them I asked her what they had. She was even more confused when I asked if they even had wine. After a few long minutes I was told they had red and white wine. Ok I'm not sure if she was new ir maybe smoking something but come on! Eventually I found out it was all Sutter Home and ordered a beer. We were told there are new owners. At this point we paid for our drinks deciding that if she didn't know basics about the drinks the food would REALLY be confusing even though the menu was so short. We didn't want to risk it. Good luck to the new owners as we think you'll need it! It's  a mexican restaurant so you might want to have a few custom margaritas."}
{"text":"Not a come back place!! It is Wednesday evening about 7pm now we waited 35 mins for our food. And waited 15 mins to put in our order. I got the carna Asada plate the flavor is good but it is so chewy. We will not be back. Valley Luna is still better!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but does not have very many options. Wings and Nachos for the family today. Good but not very fulfilling. Still recommend for a bar type atmosphere before catching a game in Westgate."}
{"text":"Service was super slow. First Margarita was strong then larger cups more watered down. Didn't check yelp until we got there and saw that the nachos were safe bet. They were good but needed salt and added chicken."}
{"text":"You get what you get.

Over played music which was ok to listen to 3 years ago, and even then it was annoying. Everybody seems to be trying find meaning in the bottom of the patron bottle, but here it is ill flavored vodka and crass rum. 

Bothersome promoters, the treacherous bosoms of a money tip hungry bartender defines the motion of this ocean. I got nothing against them, but I am not trying to spend many minutes in places of this level. 
Most often, i was looking at the time wishing the time to leave was not now, but back then. I would recommend this place for one reason, the 2 dollar drinks...and with such cheap drink specials you will understand the reason why they have to dangle carrots to their patrons to pull heads in the bar.

cough.... sorry...i just smelled my own smugness. Oh well....
No worries...everybody has to switch it up.

{"text":"Terrible!!! Absolutely terrible!!!!  Terrible..... I just saw a cook use the restroom and not wash his hands... Then I'm told it's been a problem before... Absolutely gross.. worst establishment ive ever been too.. the owner managememt should be ashamed !!!"}

{"text":"The staff is extremely rude and the food is horrible. Do not come here! Tegian was supposed to put us in VIP but there is no such thing as VIP here. Horrible!!!!!! Said tbt need 10 people for a gift card but they would not include myself. I will never go back here"}
{"text":"My hubby and I visited Calico Jack's this past Friday night (thankfully we didn't read all the bad review on here first). We took advantage of the Happy Hour drink specials and ordered the $2 margaritas to go with the complimentary chips and salsa.  We also grabbed the $5 appetizer specials and ordered the calamari.  Both were very good, although I prefer my calamari with a marinara sauce (they serve it with a sweet/spicy chili sauce).  For my entree, I ordered the La Torta, and I have to say that I was disappointed with it.  It's basically a grilled chicken sandwich with sliced avocado, but there was no seasoning to it--no salt, pepper, spice or anything. It was very bland.  The beans and rice that came with it were also kind of bland, so I smothered them with salsa.

The service was very prompt and courteous, and our food was delivered to our table promptly.  We really enjoyed the music soundtrack that was playing--a good mix of dance tunes on a great sound system--that was a big plus!  The ambiance was pretty cool, with a lot of leftover features from the former place (Bar Louie's), but now with a Baja vibe.

We would definitely be willing to try this place again, but would not order the same food choices.  My advice to Calico Jack's is to spice up the food and take good care of the customers!"}
{"text":"Tara the mange on bike night has no class she knew that  of  new bartenderJessica don't attend customers n a friend and a group of fifteen got thrown out cuz she paid no mind n one guy tossed a  lemon her way  to get her attn had already spent a significant amount of money no consideration on paying n tipping customers ,  place starting to suk."}
{"text":"We had dinner only room was on patio they let people smoke on the patio so wrong could not enjoy my meal asked about the law they said they were fine with it will not go back or that mall."}
{"text":"We went on a non home game day and Westgate was slow.  The restaurant has a Mexican flare tables and chairs in dining area with s large bar area with hightops. We ordered strawberry margaritas, they were generous in pour and size.  They were topped with whipped cream.   Chips and salsa were warm and fresh, they even have refills.  For meals we both ordered fajitas.  They offered to do a split of the 4 types of meats, however we went with the chicken.  They were served with fresh warm tortillas, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, the usual.  The chicken was tender sizzling on a bed of grilled onions and peppers.  They were well seasoned to perfection.  Plenty of leftovers.  While we were there the Cardinal walk in dancing and having fun.  Surprising to see a cardinal seeing they were playing in Detroit.  Ramon the cardinal was a fun bonus especially for my 78 yr old mother, he was a kind young man who just wants to make people smile.  Nothing wrong with that, we need more folks like Ramon.  Give Calicos a true, just not on home game day based on others reviews. We had a nice meal. We will gladly return."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location at Westgate. Showed up on a Saturday before it got too busy so we were able to chill for awhile and enjoy the music and atmosphere. Around 10 or so they started clearing the tables from the floor. The DJ was playing pretty good music and had the dance floor pretty full. 

It was a cool spot to chill with some friends while visiting for a weekend."}
{"text":"Absolutely sad, on west gates website it has a Monday through Sunday happy hour/ specials so my fiancé and I drove from surprise to have a drink and some decent Mexican food. We show up and order a draft beer and a margarita and some burritos, the food was fine, but when we got the check we were shocked. Honestly disappointed. A 12.00 margarita? Plus a 6.00 beer... the website has the specials after 4 pm on Sunday 3.00 margaritas and 2.00 draft beers. I showed the waitress who went and showed her manager. The manager said it's old and that they wouldn't honor it... so instead of a 25.00 bill it came out to 42... for two drinks... really sad. Rachel the waitress was great. Just don't show up expecting to utilize the specials on the website"}
{"text":"I honestly loved this place until last night. My friends and I were sitting on a bench in front of the place after leaving my friend asked how do we enter the Halloween costume contest? And the bouncers response was you are too drunk to enter? I thought the comment was rude and uncalled for so I said are you serious? And was upset because all we asked was a question. If he didn't know the answer he could have just walked away. Then everyone of his coworkers took his side and when we got loud they called the police/security and they didn't even listen to our side of the story. Long story short I will never go there again. I won't be disrespected and give money to people who don't give a fuck."}
{"text":"Never had food here, but it's poppin Friday and Saturday nights. I'm 30 and the crowd is pretty good. Great music, packed AF, I always have a good time. DJ usually is there on the weekends. Everyone is dancing and raging. Good times!"}
{"text":"Came in on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Server was prompt and friendly. However, about 10 minutes into our meal, ROACHES crawling on the walls. We were sitting against the wall and my boyfriend looks up and sees two ROACHES crawling along the base of the sitting wall and one on the wall. He got up and informed the server. As I was standing there waiting for the manager to come out I see a couple more coming out of the corner. Clearly an infest. Well the manager never came out to apologize. The server told us our meal was on them and if we wanted to stick around and finish our food we could move tables. No thank you! Lost my appetite in a major way!!! Also, what a coward the manager was by not coming out and even apologizing for the incident. Will never, ever return! Food consumer beware!!!"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad. We do not go out to eat often but will definitely not go here again. Hockey fans were going into the arena, so it wasn't busy. Picnic tables outside were low - maybe set up for a midget and I am short - 5' 1\". Waitress was terrible - unattentive - very very slow getting drinks , chips etc. food was less than adequate. Do not waste $$ here Taco Bell would be better."}
{"text":"Ehh it's nothing fantastic.  The staff is always pretty nice and service is fine but the food could definitely be better or have better prices.  We've gone a few times just because it's so convenient to our house but it doesn't really get any better and never completely satisfied.  Our last was on an event day, which made the experience worse because prices were higher, menu was limited and we still weren't that thrilled with our food choices"}
{"text":"Well my bad, I was disappointed with this place a couple of years ago, and said that I would never go back....but I did. Let me set the scene; Labor day, happy hour, just me and the hubs, and when I say just us, there was no one else in the place. !.Except for the kitchen crew setting at a table and the bartender, We walked in to an empty bar and was told that none of the taps worked, so only bottled beer 2. Menu thrown on the bar and told to take a seat anywhere (I think he assumed we were going to sit at the bar so I went and got the menus myself. 3. If the taps aren't working wouldn't you think they would give you a drink menu? No, I had to go to the bar and ask for it. 4. Went back to the bar to order my drinks because no one else made an attempt to come to the table. 5. Drinks came along with chips and salsa and bartender, and asked if we were ready to order so we did, 10 minutes later he came back and informed us that there was no sirloin which was what my hubs ordered. 6. Chips were warm and slightly salty, but it was obvious by the grease that it was probably due to be thrown out about 2 months prior, disgusting, salsa was tinny and tasteless, so that was a wash and I love me some chips. 7. Drinks were pretty good so we needed another, So my  hubs went to the bar to order them....mind you there is still no one in the place other than us and the bartender not sure why they weren't coming to the table. 8 Meal arrives and we had both ordered a chicken meal, one Chipotle the other Poblano....both were 17$, which was a bit expensive, but I am willing to pay if it is good. 9. Well it wasn't good....the chicken was 1/2 breast sliced in half to make it so thin it ended up like show leather, on both plates...the rice looked like and tasted like Campbell veggie soup with overcooked rice, no flour tortillas with the meal, But we both received a healthy supply of undercooked Brocolli on our plates...I still can't figure that one out?. 10. Mine was luke warm at best which tells me that mine was prob already done waiting on the hubs chicken to get overcooked. 11. While we were eating another waitress/bartender came in and although there were  a couple of dirty tables, she nor anyone ever attempted to bus the tables, she was busy however, on her phone the whole time. 12. When all was said and done, I told the bartender that it was mediocre  meal at best, so he gave us a free dessert and 20% off the bill, later to be added back on because I had a coupon....

Do yourself a favor and save yourself some money and go elsewhere at Westgate, what a disappointment, if I could have given it no stars, I would. I cannot believe that this place is still open???And this place calls itself a Mexican eatery, that is a disgrace to Mexican food!!"}

If you are going to have a location this close to the stadium have sufficient, friendly staff to make it work."}

Would give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Sure glad Mystery Diners wasn't there.  Stood at door for several minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there.  Very few people people were there.  Told to sit at bar or at booths along the wall.  The tables were all dirty and still had dishes on them.  Got our drinks very quickly and waitress was prompt.  We had the mispleasure of hearing the manager ordering booze.  Shouldn't that be kept out of earshot of the customers?  Food not too bad.  Placed an order for a burrito to go and it was just a plain, unappetizing looking burrio.  Nothing was on it.  I asked for sauce to go on it.  When I approached the waitress at the bar for the sauce there was a woman standing behind the bar with a baby!  I sure hope the kid wasn't changed there.  Won't go back.  Managers and workers were all seated in the public area doing some sort of work.  Not professional!"}

{"text":"The food is passable, but absolutely garbage service and totally overpriced. Come in if you have no options from surrounding restaurants, but DO NOT make this your first choice to try.

Edit for clarity: We came in before a hockey game to have some drinks and order food. Four people all with alcohol and food orders, and multiple times we literally had to wave our hands like children to get our server's attention. Loudly saying excuse me multiple times as she passed never seemed to work.

We went back after the game when the restaurant converts to more of a late night atmosphere for drinks and dancing. I went up to the bar where I was the only person waiting between 6 empty seats, and very few people had come to the bar in general. Two bartenders walked in front of me, stood there chatting while one of them poured a beer from the tap, and then walked away to the other side again. Not an acknowledgement of any kind. I would have accepted eye contact, a head nod, a finger up to signal 'one moment' - nothing. Totally ignored.

With half a dozen good size bars within short walking distance, I will be sure never to give another dime to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is next to Hell's Half Acre so I believe they should rename it Hell Hole because that is what this place resembles. I went into this place because of the signage outside the restaurant that mentioned their happy hour currently being served. After being seated, I waited for twenty minutes before I got up and had to ask for service. After being greeted, I was informed there was no happy hour despite the multiple signs advertising it. The food took forever and was not very good. The quesadilla was a tortilla with a piece of cheese in it. The menu said it had guacamole but mine did not come with anything on it. The tortilla and slice of cheese cost about 11 dollars. This place is a disaster and they do not seem to care."}
{"text":"WOW.......how do you run out of tea??    They were out of tea?? Iced tea.....in ARIZONA ON GAME DAY? 

Service was horrible.  Food was just okay.  Had to get my own silverware. 
Would never go again.  Read the reviews on line before and was not looking forward to it.  However,  had to meet our group there not by choice.

You live you learn.  By the way as you walked to the women's restroom the men's door was opened and you could peek at the urinals that were being used.  Nice!!"}

{"text":"Not impressed! My family meet some friends from out of town for dinner. Place pretty empty, about 7 pm. My first margarita was great, but that was the only thing that was worth paying for. The food was not appealing, and tasted worse, and was not hot (more like room temp) You would think with only 3 entree items they would have mastered those items)
My son ordered loaded fries- with no sour cream or onions he got both. My daughter ordered chicken wings- they were dry and not hot (temp). Everybody's order was messed up in some way. My second margarita was a waste- not good at all.
Our bill was over $100 for 2 kids 2 adults! Really?? Wouldn't be a problem if we didn't have to order pizzas at the bowing alley to make up for horrible food. 
Our server was friendly, but still not worth the $.
We will research prior to picking next time!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!  We didn't even get a chance to eat.  We came in on a Monday night, there was NO one there.  We sat down, and waited...and waited...and waited.  Finally we went and asked the bartender for menus, we were given one.  We made our choice, still no waiter/waitress.  The bartender at that point disappeared as well.  We got up and found him hiding on the other side of the bar, texting. Upon leaving, I said \"I guess we will leave since you have no waiters\" and was answered with a rude, under-his-breath comment from the bartender, who barely looked up.  No thanks, too many other choices of places that will actually appreciate my business.  This place won't last long with this kind of service...no wonder it was empty."}

I had a Tito's margarita and chicken quesadilla and friend had a flavored margarita and chimichanga things.
Both drinks and both plates were really good and our server was super friendly to my pup and us in general.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Really bothers me that I have to give them even 1 star!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!

Last night a friend and I were going to go to Calico Jacks.  After we walked up to the door the bouncer (not sure of his name) told my friend he wouldn't be allowed in because he was wearing a jersey and the dress code states that men can't wear sleeveless shirts.  Out of curiosity, my friend politely asked, \"Why is it okay for women to wear sleeveless shirts?\" And he goes, \"I'm sorry... it's just policy.\" My friend and I were a little disappointed but we were like, \"Okay\" and proceeded to walk away. Upon leaving, I overheard another bouncer, ZACH, say the word \"Faggot.\"  I turned around and asked him what he just said and, without hesitation, he looked me in the eyes and said, \"I called your friend a faggot.\"  I was absolutely livid. 1) How completely unprofessional and 2) How completely UNJUSTIFIED. We did absolutely NOTHING to merit Zach using such a derogatory and discriminatory term.  After a few choice words with Zach we asked to speak to the manager, JEFF, who acted completely uninterested with what we had to say and told us, \"Yeah... yeah I'll talk to him about it... thanks.\"

This is the first review I've ever written on yelp (or on any website, really). I signed up specifically to post this review because of how absolutely offended I am at the sheer lack of ANY professionalism at this location, as well as the blatant homophobia.  I plan on calling every day until I find out that something has been done about this.  If you'd like any more information please feel free to ask."}
{"text":"The margaritas where LARGE and tasty.  The salsa was very fresh but I had expected more kick to it...since we were at a Mexican restaurant.

We also ordered the cilantro lime chicken wings.  A dozen for 9.99.  With tip, the order of wings & 4 margaritas we paid about $55 total.  So not toooo bad.

This was another one of those places where no one wears a name tag. We were unaware of our servers name until the check came. (the other being LGO)"}

Not very busy and yet couldn't get a refill. We got our chips and salsa about 2 minutes before our food. Lots of staff but none seemed to be doing anything. 

Food, meh. 

Salsa was alright. the chips were the bottom of the bag, broken into little pieces. The wife barely touched her carne asada tacos and my carnitas tacos were basically cilantro flavored. My daughter did enjoy the bacon cheesy fries. 

Price, horrible.

Portion sizes were small for the price. I guess I'm used to more bang for my buck. 

Family ambiance, poor. 

It really isn't great for kids. No separate kid menu. If you have picky kids this isn't the place to be. 

There's better Mexican places nearby. A lot of them. If you plan on tequila shots this might be the place to be but if you want a nice meal, I'd suggest passing it by."}

When we got there they gave my boyfriend a hard time about his sneakers so we talked to the manager and he let us in. They were also charging a 5$ cover that night which I think is ridiculous. I would never pay money to get into a bar like Calico Jack's so we all left and gave Saddle Ranch our business. I really liked this bar when it first opened but over time the crowd has gone downhill and the doormen are out of control!"}

{"text":"This place is an effing joke...especially at night. I can't comment on the food but the bar service and drinks are horrible. First off, if you want a drink, get in line sister...cause you got about a 20 minute wait ahead of you. Their margaritas taste like too much cheap sugary margarita mix and not enough tequila...the beers are served in either hot glasses or tiny plastic cups, and other drinks like whiskey sours are heavy on the sour, barely any whiskey. Wtf? Oh, and I recall ordering a red bull (straight) it was given to me in a tiny cup (redbull is what? 8 ounces maybe?) I didn't even get the full can, but yet handed the guy a $10 and got back like $3...wtf? How does that work?
Do yourself a favor, put yourself on their VIP list, get your five free drinks by doing so, then bail and take your drinking money elsewhere..."}
{"text":"**DIDNT ACTUALLY EAT HERE!**
Last night we were at Westgate waiting to see the fireworks so we figured we'd try somewhere new to us for an appetizer and drink. This place had no line and nearly everywhere else was too busy. First, the hostess was pretty much nowhere to be found for probably five minutes. Finally she came around and said \"let me go check and see if we have tables.\" Which was extremely weird since... we could see three open tables... Eventually she sat us and brought menus back after seating us and then grabbed silverware in a separate run. The entire hostess interaction was uncomfortable and awkward - she was really quiet. Maybe she was new? 

Anyway, after sitting for awhile thinking about whether or not we wanted to stay, we asked to see a drink menu and we were told they didn't have a real drink menu and that the bartender would just make whatever we wanted. OK, I was hoping for some kind of speciality drink to the place but it's not a deal breaker. When the waitress couldn't tell us the prices of cocktails, that's when we decided to leave. Overall, it needs a good cleaning, an updated staff, and it really just doesn't have great atmosphere. I don't like leaving a review for somewhere I didn't eat but I couldn't resist for this one."}
{"text":"I try to be a positive person but our experience here was not good. The food was mediocre at best and the service was awful. Watched our waitress stand and converse with someone for 15 minutes and we all had empty drinks. I politely requested she bring us another round on my way to the restroom. When I returned to the table, my friends had cancelled the order as the waitress continued to have a personal conversation and went to the bar to order the drinks. They requested the check which took another 30 minutes. Bad food + bad service = no return. They need stronger management here. Had they been around they would have seen what was happening. There were several upset patrons. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I would put zero star if I could TERRIBLE! Steak tacos had no flavor when I asked for hot salsa the waiter/bartender brought me cholula seriously at a Mexican restaurant you would expect HOT SAUCE! Corona was warm and server brought out warm mug!~ oh and by the way lunch for two w 2 beers was $45.00!"}
{"text":"Good music to dance to but too ghetto for my tastes. In addition, after you pay a cover and go in you can't go out and come back in. You have to pay the cover again. That's gotta be one of the stupidest thing I ever heard."}

Food is lousy and the service was the worst our party have ever had...talk about slow...turtles couldve been quicker than the gal that was taking care of us...The manager who we complained to didnt really care and waitress could only say she was swamped...hello,,,bring in more people when busy!   fire the manager and re-train waitress\"s that cant dish out good service."}
{"text":"Isabel was the best bartender!! Coming back just for her, she gave great service while dealing with many intoxicated guests. She was very efficient and kept the drinks coming!"}
{"text":"Well, I accompanied my friend here a weeks ago because his friend had a special happy hour thing going on. 

So in order to receive the happy hour promotional benefits, you had to wear a wrists band based on the person your representing. So I'm thinking, \"Going to get good beer and liquor at good prices!\", nope. All they did was lower their ridiculous prices down to regular bar prices. Furthermore, not only do they not have any special exotic drinks, but they didn't even have a special house drink nor any drink specials. Not impressed. Also the happy hour wrist band prevents you from having to pay the $10 entrance fee.  *rolls eyes*

It had a club/restaurant/sports bar atmosphere. Weird combination to say the least but it smelled good. And the waitresses in tight short black shorts were pleasing to the eyes I guess. I guess my main complaint about this place is, it doesnt seem like a place where I am willing to follow their strict dress requirements just so I can have a basic bar experience. If you must go, make sure you have a happy hour promotional thing going on. I personally will just go to the yard house or margaritaville. Or maybe just to johnny rockets or something. West gate has way better selections."}
{"text":"Westgate occupies an interesting space in the West Valley nightlife ecosystem. If you live in Peoria or Glendale and Friday night rolls around, you may not feel like making the long trek out to the *cool* parts of town. When that conversation comes up, you know that you can come here and have multiple options.  If one of them isn't scratching whatever itch you need to scratch, you can quickly move on from there. For this, Calico Jack's is a completely fine option. 

I should say that I have no interest in reviewing this as a restaurant. Other reviews seem to cover that aspect of the experience, and anything I have to say probably wouldn't be helpful. What this place is to me is somewhere where you order 4 shots of Jager, pay $32 (just a shot in the dark on the price, but Dos Equis is $6 per bottle so it's probably not far off) plus tip on that tab, and go out have fun on the dance floor if that's your thing. On a weekend, if you're a male without female companions, expect to pay a cover charge. $5 will get you in, which is completely reasonable. It also doesn't take too long to get a drink at the bar here, since they have two separate bars along with a server that sells a simplified offering of alcohol from an accessible location. One positive thing is that there is a part of the patio where the music isn't piped into, so you can have a conversation at a reasonable volume. However, it is where they quarantine the smokers. 

Ultimately, whenever I end up at Westgate on a weekend night, I stop by for a little while and don't regret the decision immediately. It seems to know what kind of audience it's aiming for, and competently caters to them."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food and drinks!!! Had the 3 taco combo. Highly recommend the shrimp tacos and the carne asada tacos. Simply amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Initial review @ 5 stars: Stumbled upon this place after leaving the shout house. This place attracted the attention of my gf and I. The DJ was playing some ol' school hip-hop that we both appreciated. It was a lot of fun with a lot of great customers on the dance floor that made the night so much fun and friendly. We loved it so much, we decided to join in on the fun again in the near future. Awesome music and NO cover charge. It was very entertaining to see one of the employees pop smoothly to the tunes. That Asian guy has SKILLS. Seriously! The beverages are affordable. :)

Newest review after my recent visit. Not so good.  So my rating has changed.  Different DJ, different music, now go-go dancers. Bartender for whatever reason took waaay to long to get our orders and had serviced many that came up immediately while my gfs and I waited for a good 20 minutes or so.  It was ridiculous.  I did not eat here."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin.  We were there on a Wednesday night at 6ish. The place was empty and  we sat outside on the patio.  It was happy hour so we ordered 2 appetizers( cheesy tots and 7 layer dip), which were the best part of the whole meal.  Here's where the night goes down hill....out come our meals and 2 of our party of 5 ordered steak fajitas, and the server brought chicken.  No problem she made a mistake, she takes it back the rest of us eat our meals, thinking that the fajitas will be out shortly...wrong!  We. Are now done and still no fajita, but out come fajitas to another table.  At this point the waitress has started to act like we don't exist.  It's now 7:40 and no fajitas.  Another waiter sees we are stairing at the door and asks if we are ok or need anything, and we explain.  Finally out come fajitas.  Our waitress drops them off and disappears again. The manager does come over and comps the fajitas and offers us a round of drinks! Sweet!  It's now 8:15 and we would like to leave but can't find someone for the bill.  Flag down our waitress and she gets the bill.  Wanna guess?  It's not right.  1 fajita not compted, sides of stuff we ordered but never got, apps not half off ( because we had been there for so long) it was not happy hour. Needless to say the bill had to be changed 3 times, at one point the waitress tried to snatch it out of my husbands hand.   The whole thing was a hot mess.  I had a hard time putting 1 star but the patio is a great place and the appetizers were pretty good."}

{"text":"Probably the worse meal we have had out.  Restaurant was empty at 5 pm which should have been a hint.  It was taco Tuesday--$2 street tacos.  We had 3 different tacos each.  There was 1 teaspoon meat, tons of raw onion chunks on a single mushy tortilla that fell apart.  When I requested salsa, I was pointed to the \"salsa bar\".  It was a small metal container at the end of the bar with a mix of jalapeños, pico and cheese - barely enough for a table of 4 let alone an entire restaurant.  Lucky for us the place was empty.  I ordered a \"fresh\" strawberry margarita which cost an extra $2 because it was \"fresh\".  Nothing fresh about it - sugary sweet purée.  Beers were stanky.  Had to ask multiple times for water."}
{"text":"Website said half-priced apps but waitress said website \"needs updating.\" So false advertising. Warm beer served in plastic cups. Bartender sat in a booth on her phone while our beers sat empty. Charge the same prices as the other bars in Westgate. I suggest going literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"I always have a great time here on Saturday nights. I came here with a group to celebrate business success, and we were all pretty entertained with the great DJ, and vibrant staff. The bartenders here seem well trained, as they don't let people camp out at the bar trying to order a drink. Everything seemed like a well oil machine when getting service. 

The DJ played a lot of great new jams mixed with some old school hits. It was really cool to hear! At about 10pm they clear the dinning area of table and chairs to create a dance floor right in front of the DJ. This is about the time is started to get busier and a lot more fun.

There is a large in door bar and a smaller outdoor bar to order drinks from. Looked like they had a VIP area also that you can reserve. I havn't tried the food here yet. I'll have to do that on my next visit. 

All in all my group and I had a great time here."}
{"text":"$6.00 for a draft beer that wasn't even the size of a regular bottle of beer?!?!?!

I am not going to go into details but 5 of us were here today for lunch and this was one of the worst places in Arizona that I have ever been for Mexican food.  The food quality is poor, the \"summer menu\" was limited in choices, the street tacos were nothing to write home about.  The white \"cheese\" on the nachos tasted like paste.  I was thrown back when the bill arrived and after a 20% tip, we blew $80.00 here and there was NO WAY this place was worth an $80.00 lunch.

DO NOT GO HERE FOR THE FOOD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I personally liked the feel especially compared to the other bars in the Westgate center! I prefer the upbeat vibe and decor! Had Coronaritas and they were bomb! I think they are my new fave drink!"}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad. 

My mom was in the mood for Mexican food while we were visiting Westgate for the Sidewalk Chalk Festival, so we decided to try it out. 

Worst food I've had. Period. I had the carne asada tacos. The meat was chewy and grisly, the beans and rice were lukewarm and the rice wasn't fully cooked. My mom had the chicken burrito. It was dry and very bare. It was filled with tons of lettuce and all tortilla. This food was just awful. 

Our waitress was ok. As we were leaving a guy approached and said we shorted the waitress $10, which we totally did by accident. He was very polite about it and we even tipped a little extra for the mistake. Oops."}

{"text":"I went in on the Saturday after the Tanger outlets opened up with my Mother In Law.  The food was really good.  I had a carnita's burrito and it was seasoned very well.  The service was a tad slow, but nothing to be frustrated with.  The price was decent for the portions.  I'd happily return with a few friends for some drinks and to watch a game or just hang out.  My favorite part of the restaurant is the ambiance.  It's very chill and comfortable."}
{"text":"For some reason this is the only place I can get a seat during the sporting events.  It's a basic bar food place with the usual sporting event markup.  I have been here when the whole place filled up with smoke from the kitchen, which made it hard to see the small TVs they have placed around the bar.  The chicken wings are usually a safe bet."}
{"text":"I walked into Calico's with a few friends as part of a pub crawl. It was evening so I cannot rate the restaurant fare, but there was a party going on and we were going to be part of it. 

First Impressions: outside looked pretty cool, I've walked by the place a few times, but never went in. Inside people were dancing and having a lot of fun in the middle of the room, while others rimmed the dance floor drinking and talking. The music was loud, run by a DJ and had a fair mix of R&B, Rap and Latin beats. Girls were wearing very risque clothing, generally not a complaint, but some reminded me of scenes I've seen from the People of Walmart website.
It was fun to sit there and people watch at first, and then get out and hit the floor. I showed off my best moves (Lackluster at best) and no one pointed and laughed, so it was pretty cool. 

Later: So good times right? Why not 5 stars? The problem is that the longer the night went on, the more people spilled sugary drinks on the floor. Half the night I was trying to keep from falling, the other half, I was using excessive force just to move my feet. They were virtually glued to the floor.  Nastiest floors ever!
Also, the bar is awkwardly designed. I got to an open spot near the outdoor smoking patio and waited, and waited, and waited. The bar was busy to be fair, but it was only when I moved to the center that I got served, and that was after 3 other folks who showed up after me got served first. The bartenders were definitely on auto-pilot and were not caring for the whole bar. 

Final Synopsis: Would I go back? Yes. I would go back, but not by myself, it would be to have experiences with friends that liked to dance. I realize that it's virtually impossible to keep the floors clean, so I would want to go earlier, before the floors became superglue. I wouldn't expect swift beverage service there, but I would know to go near the wells, as the bar has some dead service zones in it."}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if it was available. 1st time in and service was horrible, nacho came out ice cold, place was super hot. Took forever to checkout. Won't go back again"}
{"text":"Should have looked this place up on Yelp before going. It was empty when we got there which seemed normal because it was early. It took the waiter a little while to bring the menus. We ordered a large margarita. It was Taco Tuesday. The special was $2 street tacos and $2 rice and beans. We ordered 2 tacos each and 2 orders of rice and beans. It took longer than it should have to get our food. The tacos came out and we waited and waited for the rice and beans. We had to flag the waiter down after a while to get the rest of the order. The place was still empty so I'm not sure why he was so busy that he couldn't come over and see how we were doing. When we finally get the rice and bean the beans have jalapeno in them. I don't eat spicey food so to me they were inedible. I don't remember the menu saying the beans had jalapenos. The rice was no better it was greasy and had no flavor. I had a carnitas taco and a chicken one. This was the first time I've ordered street tacos that come with only one tortilla. The chicken taco was ok but the carnitas had no flavor. The only time our waters were refilled was at the end of the meal. When it was time to pay their pens didn't work. Two pens later I was able to pay for our disappointing meal. I will never go back to this place again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Almost forgot to add that they were playing some good Latin music but then switched it to country music. Um it's a Mexican resturant why are you playing country music?!?"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst meal we have had in a long time. It started out promising as the chips and guacamole we ordered were pretty good with large chunks of avocado in the guacamole. But that was the only good thing about this place. The refried beans were so spicy that neither my husband nor I could eat them. The rice was undercooked. The tacos hubby received were okay but they were cold and the waitress never returned for us to tell her. The pork I ordered was fatty and the seasoning was totally one dimensional. A definite let down and a place we agreed that we will never visit again."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant and obviously would not return.  The event menu was sparse but not as sparse as the serving size.  The  tacos were small, cold and contained minimal meat Certainly not worth the price."}

{"text":"I typically like to take my grill and cook for myself when I go to University of Phoenix Stadium for a Cardinal game.  In retrospect, I wish I had this time around. But, since I had a car full of family, I chose to make it easy on myself and find a place to eat at Westgate....so we wandered into Calico Jack's Cantina. Thank Goodness the Cardinals won, because this experience would've ruined my gameday otherwise. 
We were seated right away, and a waiter came over to take drink orders, which we got in good time. So far, so good. We were offered chips and salsa. But then the waiter tells us that they are putting all the food orders in at 11am, when the kitchen opens, in staggered order so it doesn't overwhelm the kitchen. Tells us it could be 35-40 minutes. No problem. There was a sign on the wall about a grand reopening just two days earlier....that should've been an indication they haven't ironed out the kinks just yet. Food was coming very slowly out of the kitchen. There were other football fans, Eagles fans, behind us screaming profanity at the TV in earshot of my kids. Best of all, the GM-- a younger looking guy in a hat, was plainly drinking beer from a can BEHIND the bar.  Is that even legal??  Waiter comes out at 11:35 and says it's still going to be another 25 minutes...OK..still good, and I asked to pay ahead so when our food comes we can eat & bolt for the stadium.  12:10 comes and no food-- and we're not alone, I talked to a guy in the bathroom who waited an hour with no food.  So when I ask the waiter says our order hasn't even been started and it'll be another 30  minutes and I ask to have my charge refunded. The waiter does this and offers a free round of beers for the inconvenience.  We asked if they'd just take that round of beers off our bar tab...DENIED! 
I won't be giving this place another chance, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else either.  But I will offer some advice to the GM....1. don't drink on the job---very unprofessional!    2.  If you have a dining room full of hungry folks drinking and watching football at 10am,  why wait until 11 to open your kitchen??  You're asking for an overwhelmed line every Sunday.  Open the kitchen at 10 and give your kitchen a fighting chance."}
{"text":"Mediocre food probably a decent bar."}
{"text":"I was injured walking into Calico Jack's because of their negligence.  You'd think they would have written a injury report.  Went back three times the next day to speak to a manager and was told to go to small claims court.  By the way, never got to speak to a manager. This place is a joke. Never stepping foot in this place again, not even if they paid my medical bills and then gave me free dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Bad service bad food didn't have their two signature drinks on a NFL Sunday before the game. Not a good place to go before the game and can't be a good place to go after. The nachos were a mess and ravioli were still frozen in the middle."}

{"text":"My friend and I arrived at 7pm and the place was empty.  Our server came almost immediately and took our drink order which was 2 frozen margaritas.  It took about 10 minutes for the drinks to come and they were 85% ice and maybe 10% margarita.  Our dinner was chicken fajitas and carne asada fajitas with rice and beans which were $2 extra.  Forget the rice and beans cause there was no taste to the beans and the rice was the worst rice I have ever had! (Hard, crunchy and no flavor).  The fajitas were ok, lots of chicken, onions and peppers. The carne asada meat was way over cooked and very bland.

I won't go back there and wouldn't recommend it.  The only thing that was good was the service!"}
{"text":"After unsuccessfully sending our COLD FOOD back three times, we gave up on most of our dinner. Managed to eat the paltry servings that were warmed up in the microwave, but definitely WILL NOT ever return for food at this establishment ever again.

The only bright spot of the evening was our server who was extremly attentive, very friendly and super courteous when dealing with our situation."}

Very unprofessional and apparently 2 other individuals had a similar altercation with the same guard moments before. The bartenders work at a slow pace, cursed at us for asking then to attend us and do not do much to enhance the experience. If you are visiting Glendale like I did I would recommend seeking other options."}
{"text":"Just went in after working a long event in Westgate to grab an appetizer for the long drive home. I got the Mini Chimis and OMG they were amazing, by far the best I've had. If that is any indication of the rest of their menu then I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cannot comment on the food because we left before we could even get any drinks. Waited 20 minutes or more. Now we know why they had the shortest wait of all restaurants at Westgate."}
{"text":"NOPE! HUH UH! DOO-DOO! Ok. This is pretty harsh. I was there for the first time on 9/2/2010 before the last of the Cardinals pre-season opener for a bite before the game. There was a wait....ok....got it! However, their were open tables? Don't GOT it! The hostess said \"Your table is ready\" yay! \"Oh, by the way would you mind sitting on the patio\"? We were game for it. The Hostess then walks us through the patio and out to.....wait for it......Arizona beach area?! Low back, low to the ground wooden benches and beach style chairs. Yeah, sure in Arizona 100 plus heat. Not happening. So, we wait for an inside table. We eventually get one. The friendly waitress Jesse takes our drink order. We wait about 4 minutes or so.....perfect. Jesse takes our food order. We wait about 50 minutes for not so good food. I was with 2 other people. We ordered the following. Person #1 ordered Nacho's w/ sour cream on the side. Person #2 ordered a grilled chicken Quesadilla and I ordered fried Ice Cream. They were all terrible. The Quesadilla was as thin as Taco Bell's and three times the price. I mean they were SKIMPY! The Nacho's I was told were chewy. Nice, just what one would like, chewy nacho's. Jesse our server did apologize for the wait saying this \" Im so sorry you had to wait. I keep telling the staff to hold off on seating people to give the kitchen a chance to get caught up\" WELL, that explains why we could not be sat inside when there were tables open. So, like I said. Pretty bad execution, bad food, long wait. NO GOOD! If you go keep in mind too the menu is extremely limited. So, ADIOS....thats goodbye in.....well I'm just sticking with the theme, using my resources!"}
{"text":"Really good music and so worth the $5 dollars. For guys is $10, the dj is really and alway make the environment sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is awful.  No drink menu and subpar food. They nearly killed my friend, she had to eat an entire tube of Tums to restore balance after a Marg and Chimichangas."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent.  Service was slow, and wasn't particularly busy.  Beware sitting on the east patio, you'll get mixed whiffs of sewage and propane the whole time you're trying to eat."}
{"text":"OIL WAS BAD and had to order again, the second time it came out worse and I had to get a refund and leave. Never again. The menu even states that the table need to have 10 dollars per person per hour, and may charge extra if this is not met."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service SUCKED. They ran out of silverware and was forced to eat my dinner with a steak knife and a flimsy plastic fork.  Waitress took forever to bring water to the table. After food was served never saw her again. Probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"May be the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I can make a better burrito at home, with white bread and ground beef."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Bad food, bad service (except for one awesome waitress) and there is a strange woman in the bathroom who takes up the whole sink with dollar store lotion and then hands you a paper towel and expects a tip. WTF?! Go somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"I usually see the bright side of any situation, but for my experience here a 2-star review is generous and it is mostly because of the food. I came here on 08/24 at around 4:30 pm. We came specifically to this restaurant for two reasons, we had a gift certificate/coupon, and we were attending the Cardinals game at 7 pm. We intended to sit, relax, pace our eats, and drink until the game. At the time we were seated, there wasn't any wait, and there were only two tables full in the area we were sat. We looked online before we came and they had a lot of good looking choices. We we were seated, we were given a one page (front/back) Special Event menu. On this special menu, there wasn't that many options, but we thought whatever and we were hungry. Our thoughts were if the menu is smaller everything should be done correctly, wrong so wrong.  For appetizers we ordered Chips & Salsa, guacamole, and jalapeno poppers.
Chips- Wouldn't call them chips. More like tostadas broken in half and sometimes thirds.
Salsa- Not much flavor or spice and lacked salt
Guacamole- tasted like avocados were previously frozen or was in a plastic container. It lacked salt and flavor. To improve it, we used our limes from our beverages, added salt, and the salsa we had at our table. Made it better, but not by much.
Jalapeno poppers- Not what I expected. Was basically cream cheese, bacon, and diced jalapenos molded together and shaped like a jalapeno. Had good flavor and was possibly fried a little too long, but it had bacon in it, so how bad could it be.
For our entrees we ordered the taco salad and the classic taco with refried beans. I did not taste the taco salad, but it was described as OK. I had the Classic taco plate with refried beans. As stated before, everything lacked salt. I can honestly say Taco Bell tacos and pintos & cheese are far more superior then what I ate at Calico Jack's.
Now here is where the disappointment gets a little deeper. We went to pay for our bill and was told that we could NOT use our gift certificate on Special Events. Special Event? It's just a pre-season Cardinal game and being walking distance to the stadium (0.3 miles) should not be deemed a special event. I love the Cardinals, but it's no New Years celebration. Now we had to pay around $75.00 for a below standard meal when we could have gladly paid that and more at the Yard House which was nearby. Being irritated by this, my wife asked to speak to the manager to show us where it stated this on our gift certificate (really couldn't/didn't explain it well), but told us that on game days it's considered a special event, and that the menu it scaled back to items that can be cooked/prepared quickly, and that their corporate office decides when the special events are. So basically they are being lazy and greedy to quickly turn over tables.We said when we came in to the establishment, there wasn't that many people in the restaurant. We also mentioned that the food was not at all that good and he said he couldn't control what came out of the kitchen. 
Is it fair or right for them to claim around 125 events from steps away Jobing .com Arena and over 110 events at University of Phoenix Stadium as special events? Needless to say, I will not be returning to this place even if it were free. If you do, just go for the drinks, because those were very good, well made, and not watered down. Our waitress was very good and pleasant as well as all the other table staff."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best food option if looking for a meal in this area. We stopped in to grab food before a hockey game with my in-laws. It was one of the few places that wasn't a chain we have in Las Vegas, but not a great dinner spot. 

The good is that we were seated right away and the restaurant wasn't overly crowded or noisy which was nice. The seats at the table felt unstable and were the most uncomfortable restaurant chairs ever. 

My husband and I started with a margarita and it wasn't good. The flavors were not in line with a typical margarita flavor. I went with a taco plate and chose three different flavors. The tacos were okay, but not great. The waitress pointed out the salsa bar for the tacos which sounded great, but only offered a couple of salsas and wasn't particularly inviting. My husband wasn't in love with his meal either. The wings and nachos that my in-laws ordered weren't bad. The nachos were actually a very large portion that could have been shared by two people. 

Calico Jack's wasn't the worst restaurant I've been to, but given the other options in the area I would go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"1 star for basically the worst Mexican food I've ever had. 3 stars for a super cute and friendly waitress and decent margarita. Pretty disappointed the one time I don't check Yelp before dining somewhere happened to be with my boyfriends parents. 
The chips that came with the chips and salsa were warm but killed with way too much salt. My bfs mom and I both ordered the chicken burrito. It came out with no sauce, cheese, Guac or sour cream on top. It was basically Luke warm chunks of chicken with chopped ice burg lettuce and what I think was ranch inside of an old tortilla. 
None of the employees (except for our waitress) seems to be interested in smiling and our encounter with the hostesses was very awkward as well. I would definitely avoid this place at all costs. Even with the discount on food offered here. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they chose to raise prices so high during the Super Bowl. I can see higher prices if we were just buying drinks & going out into crowd with them. But we sat at a table & ate dinner (which wasn't the good btw). Was really appalled that they didn't even give us a price list of beverages so we would know ahead of time. $16 for two draft beers is outrageous. I know others are doing the same thing, however it doesn't make it right. We won't be back."}
{"text":"OMG WOW, and I don't mean in a good way. We are a party of four in an empty restaurant at 5:00. Our waiter was Ron and even with effort from us he had no energy and could even keep our order straight. When he delivered our drinks he could not even place them in front of the right person. The draft Kiltlifter was stanky. If this place was busy I might expected this bad service, but only one other couple in the hour when we were there. If you go and Ron come to take your order, move tables. I hope the GM reads this and fires this staff. No excuse for bad service when you are empty."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Their dress code doesn't fit the west side and their drinks are over priced!!! There have been some incidents where it's making me believe that the owner does not like minorities. If that is the case, they need to see where they are demographically. Believe me people other places within the vicinity know money has no color, but green."}
{"text":"Terrible.  The place was empty, yet I was served by beer in a HOT glass?  odd.  I ordered beef fajitas, and they were terrible, with much of it being such bad meat it was inedible.  The food was also extremely bland.  I asked for chips and salsa, only to never get any.

It was terrible, and I wont go back in my travels to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Hi, it was my first time her. Brandon was the most awesome bartender, he knew about beer, scotch and tequila. Cool attitude and look like a very professional guy. We will be back."}
{"text":"We have lived in Texas for over 30 years, so we've got a lot of experience eating at Mexican restaurants, particularly Tex-Mex. So we decided to try Calico Jacks. We ordered chicken fajitas and shrimp fajitas. The food tasted fine and the service was excellent (not a surprise considering how empty the place was on a Monday night). But what was very disappointing was what we did not receive. I can't recall the last time I dined at a (not fast food) Mexican restaurant in either Texas or Arizona and was not served complimentary chips and salsa immediately upon seating. No chips and salsa at Calico Jacks. I also can't recall ever ordering fajitas and not being served rice and beans as part of the standard presentation. No rice or beans with fajitas at Calico Jacks. Pricing was reasonable, except when taking into account these items that were not included. We probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I went on a Sunday to have lunch. We were the first customers since they had just opened.  The server greeted and seated us. Although he wasn't friendly he was polite. I reviewed this place on Yelp and noticed the bad reviews. But I decided to give it a try anyway.  You have to pay for chips and salsa. Not usually customary for Mexican food. I ordered anyway, when he brought out the chips he said they were on the house. We all ordered our food and sad to say that my carnitas tacos did not have any flavor. The chicken fajitas were bland. Rice/beans is not very good either. Salsa was flavorless. I was disappointed in the quality of food you get for the prices. I did however use a 20% coupon I found on Yelp. Hopefully Calico Jacks reads these reviews and makes improvements."}
{"text":"This place is so disgusting! The service was awful and made you feel that you were an inconvenience being there. I got the mix and match taco plate. Meat in taco were dry and tasteless. Bean and rice were cold. We are from out of state and should have read the reviews first (my fault). We'll make sure to tell anyone who is visiting AZ not to eat there. And if you see that one person who likes this place and says \"oh this place is great! Don't know why there are bad reviews?\" They are liars and probably work there or know people who work there. Read all the reviews first, no one likes this place and I am just one more person to confirm that."}
{"text":"My first experience with this place was during the first week of June.  I went there with a friend of mine for a quick afternoon drink.  The service was terrible, the bartender was about as friendly as rabid pitbull, and the drink was overpriced and stale.  We literally were two of maybe five people in there at the time.  

My second experience was on a Saturday night at the end of July.  I was literally as excited about standing in the 25-minute line as I am about turning 50 in a couple decades and staring down the barrel of a colonoscopy.  I could not put in to words what I thought about the clientele of this place.  Wannabe gang-bangers seemed to be the main clientele followed by guys in glittery shirts and fake diamond laced pants.  

I was in this place for about 45 minutes.  I have to admit, the music was good and the drink service was above average for the whole Westgate scene.  But, after seeing testosterone filled thugs trying to fight with everyone seemingly just trying to have a good time and being pushed by some guys on the dance floor, it was time to leave.  

I haven't been back since and don't intend to.  The place seems to attract drama and, unless this is an afternoon on NBC, I don't need that place in the Days of My Lives!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. Extremely slow and inattentive service. The food portions were the smallest I've ever seen for a Mexican dish. Ordered a quesadilla with steak ($18). Half of the tortilla had nothing inside it. Should've known why everywhere else had an hour wait and this place could seat us immediately. Don't go here, wait somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I went here for Cinco de Mayo, hearing a lot about it in advertisements. Bad idea!! There was a good crowd and limited seating. My group took a seat next to a couple of other groups and we struck up a conversation. We all ordered food and drinks separately. By the time the waitress brought us our one bottled beer, I had already gone up to the bar, got a drink and drank it. We also ordered all you can eat tacos since she suggested it to us. She returned 40 min. later to tell us they weren't doing it anymore, so we ordered nachos with no tomatoes. It ended up having tomatoes on it, but she couldn't be found, so we scrapped them off. It turns out that the couple next to use had a the same $10 off coupon as us. When we got our separate bills, the waitress said she couldn't use the coupons because we were at the same table. We weren't even at a table. We were on random benches and didn't even know the other group originally. The waitress took our coupons before we got our food and never said anything about not being able to use them then. She brought back her manager who could care less and was extremely RUDE and wouldn't listen. They ended up calling over security and the cops and kicked us out over a coupon that they couldn't apply?!? They then took our barely eaten food that we paid for and threw it all out without asking, when we were waiting to get a box! This place will not last. The group across from us said they were never coming back and it was the WORST service they've ever had. Poor management and rude waitstaff, especially Christina. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"The worst Mexifan food I've ever had.  Same for the Margarita, not even drinkable.  Had to add salt and pepper to get any flavor at all, even for the guac.  Preparations are bizarre, broccoli involved in many of the meals."}
{"text":"I like the other person don't understand the bad reviews. We are here before the disturbed concert and had EXCELLENT service and the food was amazing! We told them we had to get to the concert so they rushed our food and drink order in. They were phenomenal too and the shrimp and steak fajitas were amazing! Please don't let others influence you to try this. We did and we're thoroughly pleased!"}
{"text":"Ok so my friends talked me into going back and giving it another shot.  Mistake.  If possible, service was even worse.  I was there on Thursday evening and when we arrived it was virtually empty.  The servers would literally walk by our table and look at us but not come over.  We finally talked to the manager, Mike, and that helped.  The food was very good this time.  Still not a place I would choose to go."}
{"text":"I'm at the bar right now and I guess the white bar tender her doesn't like non whites he's very rude and he only wiped the bar by white women where I am standing and I am non white. We left a tip he didn't take it. He asked me as I as was wiping the bar \"does he need to tip me\" really? He should have wiped he bar by me as it was dirty, not to mention he's wiping he bar with a dirty towel that's not even wet, I had to take ice from drink to wipe. He has take my cup from me twice already and I wasn't done. So is it a race issue or he is just rude? I don't appreciate the service I have obtained only by this bartender. All the others have served fine. Please advise or I will go corporate."}
{"text":"I should've read the reviews before ordering food at this place.  After Monday night football, I ordered the Carne Asada taco and my friend ordered the chicken burrito.  It was the worst mexican food we've ever had. We felt stomach discomfort instantly.   I'm 100% sure we're going to pay for it tomorrow morning.  If you visit this place, order beer and chips...if you order the food on their menu, it's on you."}
{"text":"While visiting my bestie ordered their nachos. Have to say they were not good nor did they look good. My bestie sent the nachos back immediately & here comes the manager. The manager, Pam, was hospitable and asked if there was anything else we wanted. We all were ok with just having drinks and watching the Final Four. She took off the nachos off the bill. We end up getting food at the Yard House."}
{"text":"Consider Calico's game stepped up. After quite some time of avoiding the place, I came back for a special event and was not disappointed. Upon entry, the dress code looked ridiculous (Really? No plain white T's? Why?), but there were no haters, bros, or thugs in there breathing down anyone's neck. It was acoustic night, and my friends and I had a roomy booth. Sure, there is still dancing, but there also seems to be more space than I remember. Great place to be social.

And in the restroom, I was pretty surprised by the attendant. This is by no means a fancy place, but that guy was really cool and had pretty much anything that would come in handy at a bar. Like your own assist for hire.

I also take back everything I said about the VIP/referral program they have. I totally get it now: Popular people like me will pay no cover and drink for cheap every time, and you newbies will be paying $5 at the door and significantly more for your domestics and wells. When I want to drink something of higher quality, the prices aren't that bad, but it sure does help getting discounts all the time for being in the know. And even better, you get the extra hookup if you bring tons of friends. Now, I can't give the four stars I want solely on the basis of discounts, but when it comes down to it, Calico Jack's has transformed into a place cool, young adults should give a try.

PS-I haven't had the food, but you already know that's not why you're here."}
{"text":"One million times \"Meh.\"

Went here tonight before the Coyotes game.  This place was pretty much the only one without a 30-45 minute wait, so we decided to check it out.  (Yes, this should have been our first clue, and we took it - but decided to risk it anyway.)

I remember when this place was Bar Louie and AWESOME, so I already had a grudge going in.

1.  The \"new\" decor sucks.  I am not sure what the weird symbol has to do with \"Calico\" or how it all comes together to be Mexican dining, but - whatever.

2.  The wait staff was... eccentric.  All seemed to be new to waiting tables.  (And likely there to get experience to go work at Yard House... lol).  Not bad, just not particularly knowledgeable or quick.

3.  The food is DEFINITELY not great.  We had to choose from an event menu (expected) but the options were all bland.  No signature dishes jumped out at you.  It reminded me of a Taco Bell menu printed on a \"nicer\" sheet of paper.

They cut a lot of corners here.  The bill comes in a cigar box versus a typical bifold bill holder, the sugar holder is a generic white plastic thing that was hand-painted, and the nachos that we ate were about a 1/5.

We enjoyed not having to wait, but we were talking about what we \"would have had\" at the Yard House for most of our meal.

Given the vast amount of other options at Westgate, get there early so you can wait for a table and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"A disappointment. Ridiculously slow service - had to ask for everything twice. Jalapeño poppers were not good. 2 people in our group had carnitas burritos and said they weren't very good. I had the Carne asada fajitas and they were good but it wasn't worth going back. Everything was also very over-priced."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in ages to go along with ridiculous prices. 

Nachos with warmed over Cheez Whiz?  Unidentifiable chicken in fajitas. Tortillas the size of a quarter. 

Had better food at Taco Bell. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"This place is really not worth a second look. Went here for a bachelorette party because the bride to be wanted dancing. They did have a cover but I don't think they charge girls (at least we didn't get charged). The service was slow and horrible. The whole girls dancing on top of a bar in underwear and a tank top is not my thing so I was not that impressed. The DJ was decent and kept us all dancing for awhile... the later it got the more iffy the crowd got. It was soon impossible to dance without being grabbed and cornered by guys. We ended up leaving and going somewhere we could drink and have fun without being sweat-ed on by a bunch of older men."}
{"text":"Awful place. The food is blah and took 30 mins to arrive! Margarita was a lime sno-cone. Ordered a captain & coke, got a Bacardi and coke. Ordered a Mai tai, got a Bahama mama. The server spilled water on my husband. They gave us a ticket that we could come back and get a free drink after the concert, but by that time they charged a $10 cover for men. No wonder they didn't have a wait like everywhere else before the concert!"}
{"text":"Horribly over priced. Horrible service. I saw a bar tender giving away drinks to a table of girls that looked under aged. I'm pretty sure he snuck some of the drinks on my bill. I will do my best never to come back."}
{"text":"Reviews not fair for this place. From SoCal and I eat Mexican food 3-4 times a week. Food good. Drinks good. Service perfect. Don't be haters! I'll come back next time I'm here."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by for happy hour/dinner. We were seated and ordered the margaritas on special. We ordered a quesadilla (on special) and hot wings. After getting the drinks I asked for chips and salsa (yes...I had to ASK for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant). 

The quesadilla and wings were delivered with the chips (yes....it took that long to get the chips). Chips were okay. The wings and quesadilla were tasty...but the salsa and guacamole that came with the quesadilla were really bland...no flavor at all. I ordered a Negra Modelo and waited...and waited...and waited. We were literally the only table in the place but were kept waiting over and over again. 

Our server finally got to pouring my beer and then let me know that the tap was empty and asked if I wanted something else. I didn't....by this time I was over half way done with my meal and opted for a non-alcoholic beverage. The exec chef stopped by to ask how everything was. My friend let him know the salsa was bland and had no flavor. The chef explained that he had heard that before...that he was redoing the menu and that he was going to redo the salsa but he needed to go through what they had. So....you have a Mexican restaurant, you get complaints about the salsa and you want to go through what you have before you make it right? How much salsa do you have in back that you have to go through? 

The topper to our experience is when the bill came. We were charged for the beer we never got and $2 for cheese sauce (no...we didn't order cheese sauce or our wings or quesadilla). We let the manager know because our server was MIA again. He removed the items and our server came with a new check, saying \"sorry...I'm a re***d\"...how offensive is that?!? We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here last night with some girl friends and had a decent time. Seems like everyyything that had alcohol in it was $6. Shots of generic tequila, draft beers, and mixed drinks. So if youre gonna drink, just get shots because their mixed drinks SUCK and their beer is warm. I asked for a long island and got nasty watered down juice crap. Seriously the worst drink I ever had. Long islands are supposed to be strong! I had to ask the bartender outside to fix it. Apparently she knows the bartenders inside cant mix for sh*t too. Music was mostly spanish, almost made me want to leave but then they played some good stuff for like 30 min. Nobody can dance by the way. Guys and girls. Lots of older ppl and lots of shaved heads. Idk....i would say if you cant go anywhere else, this should be your last resort. Or else just get drunk and you wont really care too much."}
{"text":"We were the only two people in there (which should have been a clue),but it was a Wednesday so...
First, I must say that I thought it was pretty tacky that my Margherita came in a plastic cup!
We ordered the burritos, one chicken and one carna asada. Both of them were horrible! The meat was very dry and no taste! I have had much better at a fast food place and for much less. For the amount of food you get, and the quality of it they are very overpriced! 
I have no intention of ever going back here, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else.
A lot of changes need to be made if they plan on staying in business.
The air conditioner was not working either so it was quite hot in there. We were told that it had been out for about 6 months now!!
The only good thing I can say is the girls that were working . They were both vey nice and bubbly. Joy was our waitress"}
{"text":"For was ok, and service was ok. Nothing special tbh. Pretty blan. If your looking for good Mexican food, keep looking."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place does not have better reviews. I came here before and after the USA vs Colombia Copa America game. It was awesome! They had great music and lots of dancing. It made me miss Miami since I finally found a place that has good Latin music. Prices for drink and food were not bad. The service was very nice and fast. I will be back."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place 1 star due to the fact the hostess/ or possible manager took our table away from us right before the rest of our group was about to arrive. I understand it was busy due to preseason football but we were paying customers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the hostess and waitress were great. Even the manager came by to see how we were......but.... The food.  Hmmm. Mission flour tortillas chimichanga had no crisp to them at all.  Wings tasted like they were baked from the freezer  I am sure the jalepenos peppers were from a box from Walmart  the beans tasted like a generic can of beans with no flavor the rice well let's say it was probably a  5 pound bag of rice with one 5 oz can of tomato sauce added to it for color.  Absolutely no flavor at all. The hot sauce didn't even do it any justice    The burrito that we ordered was a carne asada. They should have called it the lettuce cilantro and onion burrito. We did order a beer and a drink and those were good.  It was a good thing we had a living social discount or I would have asked to leave without a check.  I will not visit their restaurant to eat again.  They may want to find a new menu or a new cook"}
{"text":"I have a whole bucket of nopes for this place. Came here to watch a NFL playoff game during the day before a hockey game at the arena. Ordered a beer and then we realized there was a memorial service happening.not next door or outside but literally in the bar. Totally felt awkward but i understand that's not the bars fault. So we stay and keep to ourselves. Then we started to notice how dirty the place was. Stained ceilings, sticky floors, a mop bucket in the hallway to the restroom to stop a leak. It was January 14th and there were still New Year's Eve napkins on the floor. The final straw was when a cockroach crawled across the bar top. It's in a really good location too. Just a shame the place is so dirty."}
{"text":"Arrived to no one manning the place. So grabbed menus and sat down. 2 other couples here and 5 filthy dirty food strewn tables. Only sat down due to a buy one get one free entree coupon from a Entertainment book. Must also say up front this is way over priced. 

Wife ordered a Margarita which turned out very nice. My Dr Pepper no ice came out a Coke with ice. 

We wanted the queso dip for $5. In order to get it you must buy the Chips and Salsa for $4 then add on the queso for another $5. So $9 for queso. It has no flavor at all. The salsa taste like hunts tomatoe sauce from a can watered down . So no free chips and salsa first off and you get completely ripped off for the salsa and queso dip. It's true value is $0. Don't eat here.

My wife ordered Caritas Buro and I the Shrimp Fajitas. The Buro has more lettace and what looks like leeks than meat. It was served a bit too cold. My Cajun shrimp fajitas were 0 star. No Cajun seasoning. Tasted like boiled shrimp that were fried. 70% of the veggies were burnt. Got 10 medium shrimp for $20. 3 had tails 1 had the digestive track still in it. So the food is Not seasoned at all and is not prepped properly at all. Eat here at your own risk. We shall never return to such a nasty place."}
{"text":"Surprising to see negative reviews here. I came here with my girlfriend 3 days in a row for a company event, and the food was great! Megan was freaking awesome!!! Everything from food to drinks were quickly served even though it was packed! Me and my gf will definitely be coming back here again next time we're in AZ."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Sunday afternoon before the Harlem Globetrotters game at Jobing.com Arena. The place was pretty much empty (not a good sign). I liked the look of the place when we walked in, but service was slow and the staff seemed very inexperienced and uninterested. It was also eerily quiet... The food was nothing spectacular or even worth mentioning really - but I will give them a couple points for their chips. Too bad Westgate has so many chains and so little \"real local flavor\"."}
{"text":"Shockingly bad experience.  Stay away.  

We decided to check this place out after seeing a writeup that they were relaunching this restaurant.  If this was the relaunch, I'm glad I hadn't been before because the experience was awful.  

We arrived after the 9/15/13 Cardinal game.  We were disappointed to find the Event Menu since it was after the game and the place wasn't busy (seems like they could serve a dinner crowd at this time if they wanted to).  Anyway, we ordered a beer, wine, chips & salsa and the mini chimichangas.  The server then informed us that they were sold out of the chimis and they were also out of salsa.  That's right, OUT OF SALSA!!!   I'm sorry - but if I were running a mexican restaurant - I would go to the Fry's up the street and buy the ingredients to make more salsa.  OR - go to Costco and get buckets of Pace.  To accept that they were out of salsa - and would be for the rest of the day - is unforgivable. 

We switched our order to just the jalapeno poppers and got our drinks -- both of which were warm.  And, although we were inside - it was hot.  Fans blowing everywhere but there didn't seem to be any AC on.  

Lastly - it was loud.  Not loud because it was crowded - but loud because they had the Sunday night football game on - which was in a rain / lightening delay - so we could hear Dan Patrick and others kill time waiting for the game to start.  IMO - putting music on and at a lower volume would have been the appropriate until the game came back on.

I thought about contacting the manager to complain but realized I don't want to go back.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Came here prior to a football game. I expected expensive food and drink, but come on, $14 for a burger, and $7 for a domestic beer. I'll wait and buy a $8 burger in the stadium. . ."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 1/2 star. The only reason I'd stick with 1 is because of our server. It's Monday, 3:45pm... no one is in here. Literally me + 3 from out of town. Ordered 3 tacos and a margarita... tacos were dry; boring and the marg was basic, wasn't asked for a salted rim, my brother ordered nachos. They were horrible. Chips tasted like they have been microwaved. Service took too long as well, which was the kitchens fault, not our server. Disgusting. Boring. Probably frozen everything. Will not eat here again unless I'm dying"}
{"text":"Took family here for dinner, we had a groupon that was nice. Overall service was great  and the portions were ample to fill us up. I usally eat the mexican food up in Globe and Miami arizona and its hgard to beat, but this was very good. Will go backto try the draft beer selection"}
{"text":"Ok, this was our 2nd time coming here ever. The 1st was last year before the last Lions/Cards game. At that time, the place was rocking, the food was flowing and the bartenders were very attentive. They even had a Bacon Bloody Mary that my girlfriend loved!! So on that note, we came back, why did we do that?

We get there about 10:15(NFL Sunday) and we were told that the kitchen didn't open till 11am, makes very little sense because the games start at 10am. Whatever, hit us with some chips and salsa for the time being.....

Server comes to us and lets us know that the kitchen is open and that we can place an order....7mins later, sorry, I was wrong kitchen is closed and you get even put in a order till 11am.....Okay.

My friend had the Chicken Quesadilla, didn't like it too much, something with off with the chicken. She ordered another one with just cheese and pico, that took about 45mins.

I have never looked at the reviews for this place and couldn't believe I didn't see these before, only because we were so hung-up on the Bacon Bloody, we didn't even think twice about it, oh yeah about that Bacon Bloody, the server told us that it didn't sell, to the point where they just gave it away for free...That's smart.


Not sure what the deal is, but if your gonna fail, do it in the summer, at least try to get it together for Football Sunday, the one day you can make a profit. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The music is so so, the management is even worse. If you like bad music and drinks that are lite this is the place for you! You can expect lots of calls for free give aways, tables Etc on Sunday's and the calls won't ever stop. If you want to be kicked out for being polite this is the place to go. So many better things to do in AZ, especially in west gate area. Don't waste your time or money. If you want to be ripped off then this place is the spot!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Where do I start?

We came here before the Coyotes game looking to grab a few drinks and food. New to town and not familiar with the area, we picked this place as I noticed there was a 20% off voucher on the Yelp app and the place wasn't too busy.

Should've. Read. The. Reviews. 

Terrible food. Below par would be putting it lightly. Dirty tables (they were super sticky!) Decent service but that can only go so far. 

My saving grace and only justifiable reason for picking such a terrible place was going to be for the 20% off coupon but when I tried to use it, the waitress said its not redeemable on game days. 

What a letdown! DONT go here."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We went here the day after Christmas for a concert. The menu had been cut down and limited. I checked the prices and selection I had seen online, and they raised the prices due to \"events\". We paid $21 for a quesadilla that had maybe a half a piece of chicken on it. We had to ask our server several times for salsa, and my brother in law ordered shrimp tacos. Not only were the tacos $17, one tacos had one piece of shrimp on it. Our bill was close to $100 and then they bring us beer in plastic cups. They can't even clean the bathrooms. Would suggest going somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My first ever review...the reason I created a yelp account! 
I didn't have high hopes for the lack of stars already when my boyfriend and mom and I decided to visit, but they took restaurant.com coupons on a weekend and we were in the westgate area so I thought \"it cant be that bad\". I was so wrong. There was only one other table in the entire bar so I wasn't shocked when our waiter greeted us right away. I ordered a margarita from the sign that hung above the bar...only to be told they do not serve those margaritas.....?? Excuse me? Hahahha what, why are they up there then? The waiter had no response, so I awkwardly ordered a beer and let it go. 
The menu had about 10 items... extremely condensed. We ordered guac and chips which ultimately came AFTER our meal, and we each had some horrible rendition of food they claimed to be Mexican. 
I could go on explaining every detail of this awful awful experience, but bottom line is - the food was awful, small portions and waaay overpriced, the service was awful. It was unanimously decided that I am never allowed to pick restaurants based on restaurant.com coupons specifically because this place was SO bad, I didn't even want to call and complain to a manager. I would not go back even if they gave me a free meal. Unless a manager could compensate me with giving me a gift certificate to a DIFFERENT restaurant FAR FAR away from this dump, calling a manager at Calico Jacks would be a downright waste of time."}
{"text":"Horrible service host was bitchy at best drinks were light and there was hair in the salsa wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy"}
{"text":"I'm all for equal rights, so why is there a $5 cover for guys? My fiancée and I wanted to enjoy a bar with some friends, but I'm suddenly the only person paying a cover because I have a penis? Bullshit. Disclaimer: she was more pissed than I was. #SexismGoesBothWays"}
{"text":"Yes the food was mediocre at best but I am increasing my review stars because our server was very personable and attentive( although I watched several other tables not get adequate service). Place was the emptiest of all and I tried not yelping for once so that's why we came. Great service for me, great sunny location on game day, food just meh."}
{"text":"Only one in the restaurant at 5:40 pm. Maybe 6 people total by the time I left at 6:30 including one loner guy at the bar smoking an e-cig as if he was cool somehow. Took 30 minutes to get a burrito and a kids bean and cheese burrito. Kids burrito was inedible because it was too spicy. My burrito came with just beans and no rice because \"they didn't make any rice today and didn't tell me\". Didn't double up the beans to make up for it, just left an empty spot on the plate where the rice should have gone. Took 25 minutes to replace kids burrito with chicken nuggets. Only one waiter and apparently a worthless cook. Never going back!  I expect the place to close down soon. Barely hanging on because of arena guests I'm sure."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star only because I HAVE to.  Our waitress was the worst I have ever seen. She asked my kid about a drink that was not included in the kids menu--without our knowledge.  The kids meal was supposedly free with each paid adult meal. We both ordered entrees, the food was cold and disgusting. We sent it back because it was just too nasty to try to eat.  We got a comp meal at the manager's request.  I guess because we were forced to send our food back, they decided to charge for the \"free\" kids meals and when I asked about an extra drink charge, we were told my daughter (who is 5), had a drink that didn't come with the kids meal and we were charged $3 for that too.  The waitress had no customer service skills whatsoever.  She could not care less that our food was cold and hard. I will never ever go back to this dump."}
{"text":"The place was empty and that should have been a sign.  The server was sweet but the food was terrible. The table was dirty and the menu was expensive.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"I don't know what most people are expecting, but I consider this one of the better dive bars around. It looks like a place built and furnished with the expectation that there would be bar fights between biker gangs. And that's ok, unless you're hoping for the typical mariachi-band type of Mexican themed place. Calico Jacks is more like the place you'd find at the end of a pier, not inside of a Ritz Carlton.

Could the place be cleaner?  Sure.
Could someone wipe off the menus every few weeks?  That'd be great.
Could the food be more \"authentic\"?  Of course.
Should they serve margaritas in glasses instead of cheap plastic? Absolutely.

But that's not why I end up at CJ's.  I usually end up here because I'm looking for some decent food and drinks either before or after a hockey game, and don't feel like waiting an hour to be seated at one of the other places at Westgate.  So I make my way back to CJ's.  

The bartenders I've had have been very friendly and quick. The waitresses are hit or miss, just like every other lower-to-middle end bar/restaurant on the planet.  The food isn't \"to die for,\" but it isn't bad either.  The drinks aren't absurdly expensive.

Again, if you're looking for truly authentic Mexican food, skip it.  If you're looking for decent food and drinks at reasonable prices because you're hungry before a game, then by all means give CJ's a shot."}
{"text":"If I could give this negative stars I would.

Should have known it was terrible as Westgate was extremely busy and people had to pay to park and this place was dead.

Had a small burrito that was $16 didn't even have cheese, oh well. But the spoon full of rice it came with was ridiculous. They don't have drinks on the menu so you pretty much just guess and ask the waitress, oh and the prices are listed but I'll let you know now it's $4 per soft drink. The menu was a piece of paper, not laminated. Gave us our bill just the receipt nothing to hold it in, gave us a pen to sign didn't work, had ink all over it. The hostess was just chilling up front chatting with people who were sitting at the fountain across from the restaurant, I could go on but I won't, please just don't come here it honestly ruined my 21st birthday."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to meet up with another Yelper...Valerie. She had invited me cuz she received VIP which included 50% off drinks from 8-10. Who wouldn't take the offer...right? The bartenders were friendly.

Since we went there early, the place was lively. Full of lights and many people. Part of their outside area has sand which I thought was cute. I gives you a relaxing atmosphere and I wish I could have snugged my feet in it, but I had boots and socks and I thought it was too much effort. LoL!

I wish I could have stayed longer to see the place turn around when they started dancing, but by 10:30 I was ready to get my groove on and had to go else."}
{"text":"Upon entry, my co-workers and I were a bit skeptical as the place was nearly empty at 1:30pm and there was not a hostess.  Eventually a girl from the kitchen yelled for us to sit anywhere we wanted.  The lunch menu is extremely limited; another 'red flag'. The salsa was really good; the chips were soggy.  Ordered the quesadilla with no meat; which was VERY good! The waitress was friendly, but a bit in over her head."}
{"text":"Celebrated a friends Birthday here last night the place was pretty lit. Great music and chill atmosphere. We had the front VIP section and it was split between two parties, no complaints except not much regular sitting room. Service was about a 3 saw the wait staff dancing in the crowd most of the time, but no one needed anything so I guess they helped keep the joint poppin with all the ass they were poppin on some of the people there!  Nice place no cover at all, or for sure none for wo"}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of coming here during my annual trip to spring training. Much like most out of state visitors I ventured out after the game on our first night out looking for a little bit of the AZ nightlife. Unfortunately, I came across this unprofessional establishment. After hearing what sounded like old school hip hop coming from downstairs, as I drank at the Shout House, I rallied our group and headed to the front door only to be greeted by an obese, rude, imbecile door man. Mind you, I have partied at some of the best bars and clubs in Vegas and Los Angeles for the better part of 12 years with minimal hassle and even fewer A-hole door guys. Upon presenting our valid government IDs we were simply told that a member of our group could not enter despite being 22 years old. The \"door guy\", as he will be known as because he doesn't deserve a name, informed us that the ID was not acceptable by Calico standards without any further explanation to which I simply responded \"ok, I guess they don't need our business,\" as he looked over his shoulder at the mostly empty business. We walked away without any further incident and walked across the way to McFaddens. As we reached the door, before we could even present our IDs, we were told by door security that we will not be allowed into their bar either. I politely asked why we were being denied and was informed that both bars are owned by the same company and that the door guy at Calico Jack's had called ahead and told them not to let us in. Apparently, we hurt his feelings in some way so he took it upon himself to put a damper on our night. Security at McFaddens went on to explain that vertical IDs, whether issued in AZ or out of state, were not accepted by any bar type establishment in the state. We chatted about the ridiculous rule and explained that we were merely looking to spend money and have a good time. My GF, thinking our nights in AZ were ruined, became upset and immediately wanted to go back to the hotel. I showed my Paramedic ID to the manager and reassured him that we are good people and  just wanted to enjoy our vacation. He offered to \"take care of us\" the following night and pointed me in the direction of Hell's Half Acre. We left for HHA and never looked back at either bar mentioned previously. Hell's had affordable strong drinks, friendly staff and awesome metal music. I even made friends with the security guard during my week long stay and became a repeat customer. CJ's is losing money because a minimum wage door guy doesn't have the ability to articulate like a normal human being nor the ability to give proper customer service. Maybe if he cared about keeping his job or keeping this place in business he would be polite to guests of this establishment. I would have been willing to plan a night out with just my GF and I for the sake of trying some place new but not after that experience. Who knows maybe he was just racist. This is AZ after all. I hope to return to spring training next year to see this bar replaced by something better. Look at all their poor reviews if you don't believe me."}
{"text":"The worst bar at Westgate for sure. $10 cover charge, and then the bouncer getting up in my husband's face when he was trying to leave."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time about a week ago for a friend's birthday. Wanted to grab some drinks for her special occasion. Walked in and the place was completely empty. Sat down at the bar and ordered a round of overpriced tequila shots. The bartender checked our IDs. I didn't have my drivers license because I had left it at my apartment complex office, but I did have my passport. Showed it to her, she told me it was expired. Confused, I looked at it and she pointed to a date that read the year 2010. Annoyed, we left. After we left, I looked over my passport, confused as to why I hadn't come across this problem before (especially since I had recently used my passport to go to mexico). SHE HAD READ THE ISSUE DATE.. NOT THE EXPIRATION DATE. It was good till 2020. You would think a bartender would know how to check an ID.. Big bummer because the place was dead and we ended up spending about $350 at the bar we went to next!"}
{"text":"Never been here. Never heard of them, until they called and texted me twice in a day...to let me know that I had won free drinks and no cover to a VIP night...I did not go."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best. After being seated it was almost ten minutes before a waitress came over. After taking my drink and food order, the food came out in less than ten minutes, but no beverage. The server said she would take care of it, but she disappeared. Ten minutes later I flagged down the waitress and asked about my beverage. I finally got it and that was the last time I saw my waitress. I had to get up and ask the hostess to get my check. The waitress brought the check to the table, plopped it down and walked away. After waiting for her to return, I walked up to the hostess and asked her to take my CC. I then waited over fifteen minutes for my CC receipt. 

Service was unacceptable. Food was mediocre. I will not be returning. I cannot recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I think the two and one star reviews are a little harsh for this place.  We stopped in here for a drink and didn't have any issues.  It's a newer building, like most of Westgate.  We got our drinks fast, but it wasn't very crowded so maybe that's why.  They had a DJ playing music videos on the TV.  Very cool.  It was a Thursday.  I didn't try any of the food, so I can't speak for that.  But in terms of the actual building, and service, and even the prices, I don't see any major issues.  I'll have to try again."}
{"text":"Plenty of bars in Westgate and THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!

It is Saturday afternoon and of the 18 beers that are on tap, the server rattled off nearly half that were out of stock.  I settled on one of the beers only for her to come back and tell me they are now out of it, too.  F-it, I don't want a beer now!  Well, I do want a beer, but they don't have any.  

How are you out of so many draft beers???  I can accept 1-2 of them being out, but your product revolves around beer and you are out of most of them.  The only reason is poor management.

Take my advice -- There are easily 10 bars in the same Westgate complex -- Go somewhere, anywhere else!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Calico Jacks has to be one of the worst places at Westgate to go at night when it turns into the bar scene. This place was definitely not built to withhold the amount of people it gets and tries too hard to be hip and upbeat. It never fails almost every time I go there I feel very uncomfortable and claustrophobic, there is literally no point in trying to dance here because you can barely move you feel like a sardine. It also gets extremely hot and it's fine to get hot and sweaty if you are dancing but if you are just standing there and barely moving and you get all gross then that is absolutely ridiculous. It is also takes forever to get a drink from the bar located inside because you can literally stand there for a good half hour and not even get noticed by the bartender. Therefore, I would not recommend this place to anyone unless it does some serious remodeling."}
{"text":"I can't even say how the food is. I was here for 20 min, asked a waitress if I could order then she never came back. 15 minutes after that another one said it might be best if I got my own drinks from the bar. Are you kidding me? NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Food was very flavorless. It had heat spice but no flavor. I had the grilled chicken tacos. My son's had the steak burritos with the same results, flavorless. And the portions are rather small for the prices."}
{"text":"The bouncer with the big ass beard didn't let my friend in because she looked too \"wobbly\" the girl that was sober!!! He was just being an asshole!! I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"Worst place i've eaten in a long time. The waitress was very indifferent to how our food was,wheather we were happy with it or not. Way over priced. Much more experience than most mexican restaurants. Whoever called this tex mex has never had real tex mex. Don't even know where it came by the the name. Give this place a pass. There are way too many restaurants in the area to go to this one. All Mexican restaurants give free chips,this one charges. You even have to request hot sauce. I wrote a complaint via the internet to Cactus Jack and they didn't even bother to respond. I hope this place goes under quickly and allows a decent restaurant to take its place."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. . There is no other word to describe it. Honestly. It's the WORST spot in Westgate by a long shot. Food is gross and over priced drinks are over priced as well probably to compensate for all the employees that will be standing around while you wait 25 minutes to even be brought a water. Seriously. . Go somewhere else there are lots of places to get a bite and a drink in Westgate. I wish I could give them 0 stars I was so disappointed with the experience. It's the first time I've had a bad time at Westgate but my God.. it was just THAT disappointing. If this was anywhere else they would be out of business but being at Westgate it's easy to please drunk college kids. Oh and as a side note... it's a \"Cantina\" where if you want chips and salsa it will be an extra 5 dollars.. please Calico Jack's move out of Westgate so we can have another good bar/restaurant take your place."}
{"text":"Most disappointing experience ever!  Wish I had taken the time to read reviews before choosing this place.  in a nut shell we didn't even get to eat and were mistreated by the manager for no reason.  

My girlfriends and I made a quick stop on a Thursday night.  They had a bit of a wait before we could get a table but we understood and went to the bar in the meantime.  Took at least 15 minutes for a bar tender to acknowledge us and get us a drink, nothing special about the drinks.  We finally got a table and our waiter NEVER showed up.  I asked to hostess twice about it and yet no one came to take our order.  Finally I asked to speak with the Manager, who very rudely and aggressively brought water and menu's to our table interrupting us and rushing through what he was saying.  I am very disappointed at the service and at his attitude, as someone who has worked rush hour in the restaurant business before I can tell you that nothing is ever an excuse to mistreat your costumers.  Know that I tell anyone and everyone about the horrible experience I had and to never even consider coming to this establishment."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Saturday just after 8pm.
Before we even ordered, the waitress told us that she would be clocking out at 9pm.
We felt like she meant, \"hurry up and order your drinks.\" We asked for Goose IPAs and Estrella Jalliscos and the waitress informed us that they were out of those beers and they had been \"slammed\" earlier that day. We ordered other beers and tried to enjoy the night. At 8:36pm, the waitress returned with our check and told us that she was being forced to close out her tabs. We have planned to stay for a while and order a couple of rounds but we guessed that they no longer wanted us there so we paid our tab and just planned to move onto the next bar. The place was pretty empty so we are not sure why our check was closed out and given to us when we had not asked for it. We moved onto another bar and gladly gave them our business. 

Bathrooms were filthy! 

Don't waste your time here! Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Made a stop for St Patrick's day.  One star because of the bathrooms. Disgusting, they look like they haven't been cleaned in a year.  The service was good from the bartenders part but a dirty restroom means dirty restaurant. It was also early in the evening so there was no excuse. They need spring cleaning. Atmosphere was very early 20s youth."}
