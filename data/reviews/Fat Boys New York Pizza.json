{"text":"I ordered delivery today, there was a small issue w my order. The mgr called and corrected it immediately and sent me free cannoli! The delivery guy was friendly and professional and the food is as good as promised. From now on, I will order cannoli. I recommend Fat Boys.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Good pizza...im a chcagoan so to go to a n.y. pizza spot and say it is good almost curdles my blood. But it really is good. What really makes this place great is the owner. He is very personable and friendly. We got the large and oh boy was it large! Good amount of food for the money. Only reason its not 5 stars is im a Chicagoan!"}
{"text":"GREAT-WONDERFUL-AWESOME PIZZA, WINGS, & GARLIC KNOTS and the PRICE IS JUST RIGHT!!! My husband and I live right down the road from this pizza joint in Mesa...we wanted pizza today but couldn't decide between Papa John's and Pizza Hut so we said \"what the heck\" let's try that one place down the street (Fat Boys) and we are SOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY WE DID. I think we found our new favorite pizza joint and we won't have to flip a coin for it anymore :) Only down side...bring cash, they only accept cash at this time."}
{"text":"This was my second try at delivery from Fat Boys. The first time the pizza was pretty good but the dough was chewy. So I decided to give them a second try. Well I was really disappointed. Delivery took 1 hour and 45 minutes and the dough was chewy again! I called at about 1 hour and 30 minutes to ask about the delivery time. The guy who answered interrupted me in mid-sentence and told me that it had left 10 minutes ago. $35 for two chewy pizzas delivered in 100 minutes is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. It was a nice place to get pizza and not have to go to a pizza chain. Cheese bread was very good. I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"the team over at fat boys are the best in town.. there garlic knots are awesome........ plus on top of there food be out of this world the guys over at fat boys were awesome and donated to the communiuty garage sale to help rasie money for the boy scouts troop 380 they rock!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic New York style ??? Ehh. More like mediocre Arizona style. Being from Jersey where pizza places are every block I would say it was ok. Delivery was in a reasonable time. Plain slice ok. Meatball parm was not that great. Was not a fan of the garlic knots or there version of \"marinara\" (by the way, italians dont put suger in there marinara) all in all ... would only order again if I was just ordering pizza."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza! I'm a personal trainer and save pizza for cheat days and only get good pizza. I try to stay away from chain pizza places because they are not that great.   The crust is thin and just a little chewy with a very nice , not too sweet but not too salty either. They use a very good cheese and there topping are always fresh on point. I normally order there house salad as well and it always  has fresh crisp lettuce and loaded with toppings.  If your in the east valley it's defiantly worth checking out.  Hope you enjoyed my review,  Jake Lewis"}
{"text":"My story gets better! Because Fat Boys did not charge me the exact same amount twice- the $12.00 tip was not included when they ran my card the second time, the bank is charging me to further investigate. It will not be treated as an unauthorized charge instead of fraud- had it been the same amount the matter would have been over. It would be great to hear the explanation of why the tip was not included when the card was run the second time."}
{"text":"Really good, NY style pizza made with fresh dough. Great location. Fast service. You can't beat the Monday & Tuesday large pizza for $6.99 special. Also sells slices if you aren't looking for a whole pie and you can add any topping you want!"}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to love this place from the great reviews, the pizza wasn't what I expected. Their Grub Hub menu was distorted, so it was kind of annoying because I couldn't order 3 items on a single slice. So I opted for a full pizza. I love a lot of toppings, so I got quite a few. I also got a salad which was a great buy for $2.  I digress back to the pizza. I ordered :Chicken, Roasted Peppers, Onion, Tomatoes, Fresh Garlic, Spinach, Banana Peppers, Extra Cheese. The Chicken was like a tyson chicken patty cut up. Extra cheese? Spinach? No. The best thing about this pizza, was the fresh garlic. Everything else? Not worth the $10 dollars I paid for a 12\".  I'm not one to hate on local eats, or small business, but you might want to change something about your practices."}
{"text":"We ordered the 28\" pizza special. Holy cow!!! When I picked it up from Fat Boys they took it to my car. Those guys are great, funny and super nice! They made sure I had a big enough car to get it in. When I got the pizza home I had to go through my front door because the pizza box was too big for the garage door. The pizza was great!!! Perfectly cooked And their sauce is delicious. We live outside of their delivery area and I have to say its worth picking up!"}
{"text":"This place knows how to make pizza.  Not specialty pizzas, or dessert pizzas, or hipster pizzas, but real, delicious pizza.    If you grew up in a place with a real pizza joint, not a chain, it will be a taste of home.   If you didn't grow up with a pizza joint, you just found one.  In any case you owe it to yourself to grab a pie,and some garlic knots.  Your going to get some amazing pizza for not much money.    My fiancee and I were in Mesa craving pizza when Big Boys came up on a search, we stopped in, met the owner,  and ordered a one topping pepperoni pizza with garlic knots.  Normally I'm not a fan of one topping pizzas because so few places have good quality meat.  This place was different, the pepperoni was tasty with just a bit of spice to it, the sauce's seasoning was awesome, and the cheese was gooey.  All of this was accomplish with out the super grease  that many pizza places have.   The garlic knots were soft and warm with a good garlic flavor an plenty of extra chopped garlic if you want to add on more, there's no powder here.  Truly great pizza, awesome garlic knots, and its cheep, you can't go wrong.    Note due to less business in summer hours when I last went they are not accepting credit cards to try to save money."}
{"text":"Ordered two pies for delivery last night for the Tuesday special of $6.99 per 14\" pizza + $1.00 per additional topping.  Also got 10 wings (bone-in) with spicy BBQ sauce. Both were excellent! The pizza was authentic NY style, cheese and sauce were excellent, pepperoni was fresh and cooked to perfection.  The wings were very tasty and had just enough 'bite' to them to make you want to eat more! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service all at a great price...the family and I went there for lunch yesterday for the second time and it was as the first time...we even went back there for dinner after our kids' basketball games. This place is definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly service, a little drab but still satisfying. We had the slices and wings special which filled us up. Pizza was ok nothing bad nothing special. The wings were pretty good and I really liked that they had rc cola. I haven't seen that stuff since the 90's. I do wish they had iced tea and or sprite. All in all it was ok maybe even a little good."}
{"text":"Omg! seriously huge slices and so yummy! I got 2 meals out of it and for $3.00! How can you beat that? Not to mention the staff is so friendly and helpful! They should do great in is new location!"}
{"text":"First time visit to Fat Boys Pizza tonight - oh, what a wonderful surprise!  This place is legit!  Husband and I shared a $19.99 special - large pizza and a dozen wings.  The sign says \"NY style pizza\", and being from New Jersey, I'm a harsh judge.  I was NOT disappointed!  This pizza was outstanding!  Thin crust with just the right chew (not a cracker crust).  We got sausage and mushrooms - the toppings were fresh and delicious, and the pie was cooked to perfection!  LOVED the sausage (real meat, no machined sausage pellets here).  Sauce was tangy and in just the right amount on our pizza.  And the wings.....  wow! :)  We chose \"hot\" and the sauce was superb, with just the right heat and flavor.  The wings are REAL - no nuggets here! - and very meaty!  We polished off the whole dozen.  It's clear that quality is a priority in this place - excellent quality ingredients and service.  We noticed that all the employees making food were mature adults.  Gotta love it when a little, local Mom & Pop shop knocks it out of the park!  We will enthusiastically go back and back and back again!"}
{"text":"Have to say with valentines day coming up I was hoping my love of this place was going to last longer but it ended faster than a relationship on the bachelor. Greasy pizza, and super hard sub bread that almost pulled my teeth out as I tried to rip off a hunk made that clear. The sad part is the guy taking my order mentioned that he was looking to change his bread supplier (now I know why)! What makes me mad though is as a owner or manager how do you serve something like this to a paying customer and not care? I mean he made the sandwich so it was not like he did not get a chance to notice it. I guess I could give it a pass if it had been toasted but that was not the case. A cold sandwich with stale bread, and green bell peppers which taste like they were coated in sugar did not a tasty sandwich make. This place has not been around to long so they still have a chance to turn it around. As I always say try it out and judge for yourself but as for me this is one fat boy who is going to cut this place out of his diet......."}
{"text":"The pizza, wings and garlic knots are great. There seemed to be some confusion about our order, but overall a good place. Ordering for pick up might be best. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...we usually go to venezia's but not any more....Fat Boys it is!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise! My fiancé and I were in the mood for good pizza, did a yelp search and the reviews were great so we gave it a try. We got the garlic knots, an antipasto salad and a pepperoni pizza (you'll even love the crust). We loved it all! We now have a new pizza spot! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to order this pizza after reading the reviews but I'm hugely disappointed!  The crust was dry and chewy and it tasted like their ovens needed to be cleaned. The wings were just so so I've tasted waaaay better and the chicken was very fatty. On a positive note the prices can't be beat but I'd rather pay a bit more for a better taste.  I really wanted to love this pizza it just isn't that good"}
{"text":"Place smells fantastic when you first walk in. Menu if creative and everything sounds delicious. The prices are right. The place looks pretty clean, although my fiance disagreed and thought it could be cleaner.  I ordered the  spinach mozzarella roll, and he got a customized pineapple ham artichoke heart mushrooms roll. And tasted perfectly good. No complaints from my fiance about his food. The crust is a little overdone but maybe that's how New York rolls are supposed to be?  The one complaint I have is the food was served on a thin piece of paper directly on the plastic tray. No plates. The plastic tray is warped from the heat of the food. This aint Gilbert Pizza, but overall, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"FINALLY GREAT PIZZA IN MESA!  I am so happy I decided to pop in for a slice.  I wish I ordered a whole pie!  Perfect crust, yummy rich sauce (Like Grandma used to make) and lots of cheese:)  It is about time we had decent pizza in our neighborhood or in the state for that matter.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good, not as crispy as I like but very good pizza anyway. Fast delivery, and the driver was pleasantly friendly. I hate when I'm asked for a tip and he didn't ask. When I gave him a tip he was very grateful. Spaghetti portion was large and salad was fabulous. Great value and great food. Loved it. Will be a frequent customer while in mesa."}
{"text":"The first time i ever had Fat Boys Pizza I was AMAZED, but couldn't understand what it was about the food. After some careful thought I decided this: Corporate Amerika is all about consistency, so when you order a Papa J's or Pizza Cut pizza, it's going to taste the same no matter where you live. They do this, thanks in part, to processed ingredients and recipes which are canned, shipped, and sold.  Fat Boys is a little different. The cheese is REAL (not processed) and you can taste the difference when a crust is not frozen. At first, I thought it was a tad greasy, but I now crave the greasy pepperoni cause i know that means it's REAL and not processed crapola that's had the grease removed to appease the masses.   If you want something that is new and different than the corporate pizza pies you've been eating.....try Fat Boys !!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new place and ordered delivery. Yummy & reasonably priced, friendly staff. High quality ingredients, pepperoni sliced thin but large pieces, I usually don't eat the crust and I ate every bite. We will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"A damned fine slice of NY Pizza, with a pretty decent list of toppings. Got delivery from here today- it was prompt, the pizza was tasty, the price was right, and it's good for what it's good for. NY Pizza isn't my favorite, but that won't stop me from giving this place a solid rating. They do what they do, and they're doing it well. I give them props for that."}
{"text":"FINALLY, another option for amazing pizza in East Mesa!  I have been a fan of Venezia's however, they now have some competition in my opinion.  Fat Boy's has an amazing\" fatty\" pizza, a whopping 28 inches and you can buy it by the slice to try it out.!  I had the sausage pizza and this sausage is fantastic!  I had to call and make a compliment on the sausage and whoever I spoke with said they make their own sausage, so no wonder it was so good.  The sauce was flavorful with fresh herbs which I love!  I would have liked a little more of the sauce to dip my pizza in because it was so good and tasted so fresh. What I loved about the crust is that it was crispy on the outside (but not dry) and nice and moist on the inside, not chewy.  It reheated absolutely without a doubt the best I've found in East Mesa.  It somehow stayed nice and crisp and the cheese melted perfectly the second time around.  By the way, this pizza was loaded with cheese (which I love) . As far as the location, it's just not really noticeable. It is more of a neighborhood type joint.  They have some tables to eat in if you want but nothing fancy here. This is the kind of place that seems to focus more on the food and affordability and not so much the ambiance but that is what I personally prefer.  I had a friend that lives in Chandler tell me that Fat Boys opened a new Mesa location and she told me to try it out because it is her favorite.  So glad I did!  They even deliver although for some reason the profile is showing no delivery."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING on the menu is great. the jimmys Italian sub is amazing. the BEST wings you will ever have!!!!! its a no nonsense place to get good food for a good price"}
{"text":"Very good! The pizza crust was delicious, toppings and huge slices. Had hot wings too...they were dry seasoned and meaty which made them easy to handle and very filling! Fast delivery too'"}
{"text":"Last month when I bought my pizza at fat boys I had a slice and left the balance for my wife and daughter when they came home from work.  I said nothing to them.  After they finished eating the pizza I asked them what they thought about the pizza.  Both of them said it was one of the best pizzas they have had in a long while. I told them my experience and they both said I was crazy.  So.....I decided to stop in and get their lunch special of two pieces with one topping (I had mushrooms) and a soda.   I took the pizza home and got ready for the moment of truth.  I was surprised at the size of the two slices it equaled a 10 inch pizza.  I took my first bite, then another until I came to the crispy crust.  I have to admit that it was a pretty good pizza.  Perhaps my taste buds were off the first time....this is a complete reversal of my last review.  Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here because of the reviews. It was bookmarked on places to try. I could not tell you about the food because I didn't have any. I ordered a fat boy supreme and a diet coke. The cashier said the soda machine is broken and handed me a warm can of soda. It was 12 ounces and I'll bet I would have been charged for a 16 ounce fountain drink. I handed him my card to pay and he said that they only take cash. There was no sign stating this anywhere. I told him I needed to go to the ATM. I did not return. What a waste of time. Not a good way to run a business."}
