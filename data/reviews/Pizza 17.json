{"text":"this poor excuse for a business has made me lose faith and desire to order pizza ever again. my delivery took almost 2 hours to arrive when i was quoted 30 minutes, and when my food arrived it was so cold the pizza had gone stiff. frustrated, i called back to be told i was a liar, and that they refused to do anything about the terrible service and even  worse food. save yourself the money and aggravation and avoid pizza 17"}
{"text":"I am Sorry - I am giving one review to this Place.   But the Truth be told - Me and My wife got Tandoori Chicken Pizza 16 Inches - Price was $15 incl taxes. So thought it was a good deal. Guy over the counter, he is Saakib - very rude  guy. completely business oriented, does'nt even think of customer satisfaction. First of all if you ask for receipt they always give a receipt from debit card. Never ever give an official receipt - so if the pizza is not fresh no one can sue them. Never gave us a receipt.  We took pizza home. Ate 2 slices each and went off to sleep. Around 3: 30 am in the morning My Stomach all over my groin area and all over my left side of Stomach started hurting like I needed to go for an EMERGENCY. So I called Alberta health link and they said you should go and see the doctor at Emergency, if Pain is constant for more than one HOUR. My wife gave me Eno and I took another medicine Pudin hara. SO i Puked 4 to 5 times. I believe was Food poisioning. Morning time I was feeling 85% better. However I would like to Sue this place. But cannot as these People don't offer Receipts.   Please do a favour to yourself - Do not go to this place for any Pizza their slices are not fresh all day . They have increased their Pirce from $3 to $3.50 and even their Pepperoni, Ham and Chicken Pizza, it seems like they have Vegetables and Chicken like a week old. Lets say someone calls in and cancel the order. They dont cancel but let it keep. So they make money of someone else. They do not care about any one else's well being.  Please Do not Eat their food. If you don't want to go through the Experience I had :("}
{"text":"It's Sunday. It's nearly 1 am (I guess that technically makes it Monday). I want some late night food and even the donair places are closed. Where can I go that's not the nearest fast food drive through? A flashing 'open' sign in the window told me Pizza 17 might have an answer for me.  Sure enough, 2 kinds were left in the hot counter/pizza holder thing. I took a slice of each, Hawaiian and some kind of sausage one. At $3 a pop, the slices were nice and big, a perfect late night snack. It doesn't look like it's changed much since Chad W was there in '08, it wouldn't top my list as the best pizza in the city, but there's something about a late night slice of pizza, whether inebriated or not, that just tastes so gosh-darn good.  The gentleman behind the counter had a nice big smile for me, asked me if I wanted a drink and wondered if I wanted my slices to stay or go. I took mine to go, but wouldn't hesitate to sit down and eat in next time."}
