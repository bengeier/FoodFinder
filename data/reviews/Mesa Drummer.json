{"text":"The service was awful. I was given a dirty look when I asked for silverware, the waitress complained about another table to us and had to go up to the counter to get a refill on water.  The hamburger meat smelled rotten, the ranch was yellow and the wings were greasy.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Looking for a great local dive bar!?  Look no further.  This place has all the qualities of a small town watering hole. Cheap brews, good food, friendly staff (Linda) and not to mention best tunes in town because you can play what you like.  I recommend bud light by the gallons, super drummer burgers, and thursday nights cause you will have the bar to yourself."}
{"text":"Their Delicious hamburgers are soaked in wine before cooking to give them a robust and full body flavor the French fry's are big and crunchy the atmosphere is a dimly light sports bar with 9 tv's all playing different games the service is good and friendly"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch and couldn't have been more pleased. Fresh food cooked to perfection. Friendly staff. Everything you want in a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I love this place, but I miss my old bartender Terri.    The food is great.   The people that go there are super laid back and awesome.   The service is hometown.   I just miss my old bartender."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here many many times and usually meet up with old friends for a few drinks at least two to three times a month. We like that it is a small dive bar and located near out house. However there have been many disappointing visits. The wait staff is NOT friendly or inviting. One blonde waitress in particular is extremely rude. We patiently waited for her to come take drink orders and/or bring a menu, finally we just flagged her down  for a menu. She seemed irritated and threw the three  menus on our table. My husband asked the bartender about the special $2 shot which is posted on the wall. He ordered three $2 shots for then when we received our tab he charged us full price. When we asked about the price it the blonde, rude waitress started yelling at us and said she doesn't care what is posted on the wall she's not giving us the $2 special. We have given this place many chances and every time we are disappointing. we decided this place was NOT worth our money nor our time. Skip it and try another bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to see if the original wine-burger is alive and well in Mesa. Back in the 70s when all the Dirty Drummers had spun off from Wineburger they all had basically the same burger. A savory crispy texture, quality beef and all the traditional fixings. 
I'm very pleased to find the Mesa Drummer has held on and rock the original recipe. Now if only the new \"Original Wineburger\" owner could come visit and taste the real thing at Mesa Drummer or Dirty Drummer on 44th St. Maybe they can learn a thing or two and all will be right in the world of Phoenix old school grilling."}
{"text":"Decent place.folks when you go out be realistic.its a dive bar.decent place tho.id also like to address another topic.tipping.you have to tip.no its not a law but it should be.i you feel you have the right tip they certainly have the right to refuse service.this is a give and take world.if you want people to take care of you take care of them.tip 20% minimum you cheep bastards.yes even in a dive bar"}
{"text":"Needed to find a place to watch the end of the Monday night football game. A little hesitant at first as it looked like a tiny hole in the wall and would they have enough tvs. Inside looks about the size of an average size pizza place with booths and a bar and a game area. Was told they ran out of hamburger. Good thing because the pastrami sandwich was fantastic! Frys were good too. And they had my favorite beer Heineken. Plenty of tvs but sound was off and music playing and people talking loud. I should go back for another football game and try the rest of their food."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST wings of any place I've been to. Ever. I actually end up crazing their wings. It's a fun place to go to relax. Music isn't loud. There aren't obnoxious people. Karaoke on Saturdays! But what keeps me coming is the wings. Food food fooooood."}
{"text":"This is a local dive bar with great bar food. Very friendly bartender and fellow patron. If you want to have a conversation folks will indulge you in some talk. Cheap cold beer. The wings and BLT was right on. The only complaint I would have is the wings are $1 extra if you want them grilled after they come out of the fryer. Good place before or after a Cubs spring training game."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get drinks with friends. Their alcohol is priced cheap and they make the drinks good. They also play great music and their burgers are delicious!"}
{"text":"I use to think a lot of Mesa Drummer -- went twice a month 2 people could both have good meal and beer for $20.00;    Went again on 5/26 first time in long time; burger, beer, 2 orders of zucchini was $25.00???????????????  I could have had a steak   -----   WILL NEVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"Drove down from Pine, AZ for the best burger and coldest beer in the valley.  Been coming here for twenty years, has always been good."}
{"text":"This is definitely a dive bar. The service is average, the food is not bad, the TVs are terrible (like 15 years old), and the patrons are mostly creepy old dudes. I will not be coming back here. If they would update the TVs and get a better selection at the bar (whiskeys etc) I may consider returning. Overall, not very impressed."}
{"text":"Wow - what a nice surprise.   Strip mall - didn't expect much.  Friendly, great pour.  Went to A's Game - and received good info.  Great burger before the game - awesome wings after the game.  Easy walk to HoHoKam stadium.  Would definitely come back & definitely recommend to friends - whether to going to game or not.  Not a lot of beer selections, but enough. Go here!!!! A nice surprise."}
{"text":"Meh, it's just your normal dive bar. Nothing exciting here.

Came here the other night for dinner, thankfully we made HH for 2.75 bottles and 2.50 draft. 

Walked in and at first it seemed like a family resteraunt with about 8 sit-down tables. Sat at a table cuz if you sit at the bar they have 3 TVs back there but their about 12 inchs big so you better squint your eyes, especially after a few brews. Had 2 pool tables, cant recall darts or not,

The place is bland though, real old lookin. \"out-of-style\". Had their wings and they sucked. And if you want them grilled its another buck. (there goes their tip). They actually did come with celery and carrots, although you can tell the quality was low. 

Not alot of people there either... for a friday night. It explains why they use cheap food to serve, they have to make up for it somewhere.

WAITRESS NEVER SMILED. DONT LIKE YOUR JOB, DONT WORK THERE!!! Thats what really turned me off. Negative vibe right from the get go.

I will never return.
PS. other DD locations are alot better. their obviously independently owned."}
{"text":"Great bar and grill. I have been coming to this place since I was like 5. The regular order has since then changed from Shirley temple to Dos Equis with lime. Burgers are bomb! Jeremy is great! Terry is especially friendly! We  Mesa Drummer!"}
{"text":"The Drummer is a long time lunch location for my coworkers and me, 20+ years now. 

As others have noted, The Dirty Drummer is a bit divey, but the burgers are fantastic and the service is feel-good personable. So, head on over and have some soul-quenching food and a great time.

I get the Cheese Drummer with Bacon. Delicious... Mmmmm. They put a little port wine on the meat during the cooking process. There is nothing that compares to the Drummer Burger taste. It is transcendent. I can't get anything else because the burger is just too damn good to not get the same experience each time I arrive. Also, we typically share a side of crisp tasty fries and usually some wings.

It's a relaxing satisfying trip each time. The only detraction is that the beer is not cold enough for me... for me. I usually ask for a glass of ice, so I can drop a cube or two in my mug as I'm pour from the pitcher. Small price to pay. Still rates 5 stars though. 

I love coming here. Lots of memories. A few mysteries, like whether Zane (the owner) owns a pair of long pants. I don't think so, never witness him wearing anything but shorts. We'll just have to keep going to find out. 

Keep up the good work, we appreciate it.

I've probably been to the Drummer on 44th & Thomas more. That store will get a slightly different review. Both will make you happy, but the Country Club location is my favorite."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Service is acceptable, expect errors. I have never been here without at least one error. I expect it now. You get what you pay for.  Latest example: my fianc√© and I ordered apps and a beer a piece. The server gave her my beer and I hers, not a big deal. Apps were served correctly. We also ordered burgers. She order a Hawaiian w onion rings, I ordered a patty melt w sour dough and fry's. She received her correct burger but w fry's. I had to wait an additional 20 mins or so to receive my burger. As I was told the cook had placed it on rye. ( in all fairness is the correct bread, but I hate rye ) My greatest disappointment with the food it the lack of quality in the cheese. The overall savings from using Kraft flavored singles compared to real cheese takes away from what could and should be a great burger. I could I think if more people were to frequent this local bar/restaurant they might change there ways.

Don't be in s hurry."}
{"text":"Zane  has an awesome place here...been coming for a burger for over 20 years!  Game day is fun here too"}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and a beer. This is are real neighborhood bar with good service and good food. Enuf said - try it out it's great"}
{"text":"This place is great, born and raised down the road from here. Is it dated? Sure. Is it dirty? No. A great place for a hot, juicy burger and a cold beer. Great prices. Divey? Yeah. Pool tables, darts and a South Park pinball machine! What more do you need? Come here and relax with the other creepy dudes! I go at least twice a month."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Missed having a local bar to hang out in after moving down here from a small town 8 years ago. This place reminds me of home! Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Linda is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Came back to try to redeem my review ): I had to ask for a menu and got my food an hour later and I really wish I was exaggerating."}
