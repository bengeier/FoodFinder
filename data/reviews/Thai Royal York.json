{"text":"Friendly service and tasty food. Not the cheapest but not overpriced either. I ordered the coconut green curry with steamed rice and my company had spicey pad siew. Food was ready within 15 minutes. Will definitively be dining here in the future!"}
{"text":"This is a way-below average Thai restaurant.  Here's what we've had on our one and only visit:  Pad Thai: The signature Thaimerican dish is a supposed house speciality.  It appears this house specializes in bland.  I've eaten a lot of Pad Thai in my life.  This definitely ranks near the bottom on my list, where the second last position is occupied by Chef Boyardee, with death-by-starvation bringing up the rear.  Szechuan Eggplant:  In contrast to the above, this dish was actually reasonably edible.  Decent flavor to the sauce and the eggplant was prepared right.  Curried Vegetables with Tofu:  We've actually ordered steamed vegetables but received this dish instead.  What tasted like leftover vegetables with some red curry sauce dumped on top made my wife sick to her stomach.  I hate throwing out food, but this just had to go.  Chicken Fried Rice:  I know that yesterday's steamed rice is today's fried rice.  But it doesn't have to look like it.  It was unappetizing in appearance and looked like it was re-fried twice, at least.  Tasting it confirmed my suspicions.  In its defense, it was a free dish because we spent over $30.  The only positive side is that the place is fairly cheap.  But you definitely get what you pay for.  The food is worth 1 star. The value is worth maybe 3.5 stars.  Verdict: Stay away."}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant many times but didn't eat here because of the look of the restaurant, it looks weird on the outside.  Today, I was hungry and feeling like some Thai food so I gave this place a try and it was pretty good!    If you're into Chinese or Thai, give this place a try.  The owner are honest hard working people.  I was chatting with them while waiting for food and it was pleasant."}
{"text":"The crispy beef is a must have!!! This restaurant is heavy in my rotation for delivery.... And the owners are nice and genuine.   Best Thai joint that I've found in mississauga."}
{"text":"it is literally \"Eek! Methinks not.\" :) I am big fan of good Thai food, and I always drove by this place, so one day decided to stop by, I walk in, this has to one the most dingy decor I had seen in a while, staff doing chores on some tables, random pile of clothes on other tables, So I am like should I dash now? me being adventures I was like no I will order something, I try not judge a book by its cover, but in their case I should have and ran for the hills but it was too late, I ordered their special Thai rice or something, it was one of the worse fried rice let alone Thai fried rice I had ever tasted.  I had maybe two spoonful and dumped it in the trash. I would stay the away :)  PS . The portion was huge."}
