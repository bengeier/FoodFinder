{"text":"I usually stick to lurking on here, but the food was so good I was compelled to write a review. As previous reviews state, this is solid, cheap Indian food. I had the Chicken and the tomato dal and they were very good. Very. Good. Portions are very generous, the staff is very warm and inviting, and the food has a beautiful rustic, home-made quality. I will definitely be frequenting this place from now on."}
{"text":"Sree's, an Indian eatery, is one of the best things Pittsburgh offers. I am sure that due to their locations and hours that many people living in the city have not experienced their food, but it is a definite must.

I would add it too my list of places to go before you leave Pittsburgh. The menu is limited and by limited, I mean that they pretty much server the same thing every day. The main entrees are always the same. You can choose from either Tamarind chicken or vegetables and tofu.

I am not a huge tofu eater, but it is ok. The tamarind chicken is excellent.

As for the other sides, you can typically choose from:
1. Chickpeas and potatoes 
2. Spinach and potato 
3. Tomato dal
4. Grape leaves and curry
5. Spinach dal

I can highly recommend just about anything. I have been known to eat their food several times a week and I will often bring it home for my family. You get more than enough food for only $5.50

A must visit for a unique side of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Mrs. Sree is always friendly, and the food is great. Be sure to try to cauliflower on Thursdays :)"}
{"text":"Sree's on Murray, by far the best and cheapest Indian food in Pittsburgh. You get a ton of food for a small price. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"I don't get all of the good reviews for this place.  This is like Indian-ish food, very bland, visually disgusting, although served by a very nice woman.  I went on a cold day and the heat wasn't on so I had to eat as much as I could while shivering at the table.  

2 things that I've never seen at an Indian restaurant--tofu and wheat pita.  The tofu was pretty awful and a piece on naan might have saved the day instead of the dry tasteless pita.   I'd go on but I'm getting a little sick just thinking about it..

The 1 good thing is that it is vegan friendly.  But I'll go to the Indian place on 6th and find a vegan option there before returning to Sree's."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, healthy and spicy! I've been a devotee of Sree's Foods for almost a decade. When my employer moved to the North Shore a few years ago I've missed my lunch hour visits to Sree's terribly. I now brave Pittsburgh's streets on my bike for my favorite 'fast food'.  If one is accustomed to the oily, creamy, high calorie meals one typically finds at Indian restaurants, Sree's will take some getting used to. 

Mrs Sree's low-oil vegan dishes with brown rice and whole wheat bread are the healthiest options one could imagine for just $6. I can get 2-3 tasty meals out of one visit!"}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Very pleasant Mrs. Sree serves up huge servings of bland indian food and a warm brown pita.  The choices always have vegetarian options, which is a plus.  But it's quick and you can get a couple meals out of it.  I recommend adding on some of the hot sauce from the tables.  

One true positive: this is a great place to eat a quiet lunch alone."}
{"text":"My first visit was solid. Tamarind chicken, chickpeas, over rice. Flavor was great and the price was good."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sree's about once a week for the last several years. It is certainly not top end Indian food and there are very few choices. The menu rotates everyday, but most of the options remain the same. Taramind chicken, vegetable tofu, tomato dal, eggplant curry, potato chickpea and tomato cauliflower. 

Although the food isn't particularly amazing, it is an extremely good value. For six dollars you get chicken, rice, bread and a vegetarian choice or three veggie choices with rice and bread. Once in a while there are special menu offerings such as samosas and an alternative type of chicken, but not very often. 

To the people complaining, my question is what non-chain or fast food option is available as a healthy lunch in downtown Pittsburgh for six dollars?"}
{"text":"I went here a few times a week when I worked downtown regularly. I really like the food. I would get carry-out. It's cheap and good with a bit of a kick. You get it quickly and the lady is really nice.  The decor isn't great but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is about a block and a half closer to my work than an Indian Buffet nearby, so today I tried it out. I will be walking the extra block and a half from now on. The chicken and the side were OK, with good flavor overall, and I did appreciate the fact that he had a \"less spicy\" chicken option. But  I'm 99% sure the rice was just brown Minute rice and I'm 100% sure the \"flatbread\" was just half of a tortilla. Yup, just like you get from the grocery store. In my opinion, not even worth the cheap price. I will pay more and walk farther for authentic food from the buffet."}
{"text":"Sree's is one of those places that I eat at a couple times per month for the past two years.  I usually get a craving, or a co-worker gets a craving, and that craving can simply not be denied!

The tamarind chicken with rice (great texture and taste on rice!) with chickpea potato has become my staple order.  Be sure to add some of the homemade sriracha which is fantastic! It's on the long green counter near the register in the nondescript semi-translucent plastic bottle.   I also had the eggplant curry today as well.

The included pita is indeed dry and tasteless as others have mentioned, but it serves nicely as a way to suck up the sauces.

The chicken is tender and juicy, the chickpea potato flavor and sauce is awesome, and everything is nice and spicy.

It's true what others have said that the menu is basically static and that the daily offering is more or less the same.  However, sometimes there are fish dishes, sometimes there are meatballs, sometimes there's an alternative chicken dish (like today).

The service here is always friendly and fast and consistent.  I couldn't be happier with the price --- still under $6 including tax!"}
{"text":"My office exists in a culinary mine field attacked on all sides by purveyors of fast food crack. You can imagine my surprise then when instead of pizza/french fry/burger smells assaulting my senses they were instead ambushed by the lovely aroma of fresh curry and indian spices wafting from Sree's.

Fresh ingredients, vegan friendly vegetarian fair, great chicken curry, and all for about 5 bucks.  Sounds perfect doesn't it.  Well sadly, their naan doesn't quite match the level they have set in everything else.  To me it tasted liked preservatives with the same sorta flavor that you would get from store bought bagels.

So skip the naan, but feast on everything else."}
{"text":"Not bad.  But not good.  The food is a solid \"fair\".  The reason you find people who go nuts about Srees is, it is CHEAP.  It is C-H-E-A-P cheap!

I have eaten their food for lunch, since they had the one in Market Square downtown, closed about 1998 or so.  Now I go to the one on Murray in Squirrel hill, when I just want to taste something that vaguely reminds me of Indian food, I am in the area, and after a few bites, I do not mind throwing out what is left.

You get an entr√©e, with meat you get one more side, and a half slice of really lousy bread.  And in this case, I am being truthful.,  The bread slice you get with a meal at Srees is just meant to help in filling you up.  It is really bad, other than as a filler.

So, you can get a few dishes, if you go all vegetarian.  Or, if you choose the chicken with (usually) Garbonzo beans, you get one more side.

If I were on a really tight budget, like a student,  or was trying to make it to the next payday, this is a really good place that fills a niche.  But as far as being anything above \"fair\", it isn't.  Worth a try.  It is good filler if you just want a bite, or a cheap meal, but not \"good\".  

You get a LOT of food, for very little cash.  And THAT is VERY good, sometimes.  And hey, ANYTHING beats McD's or Burger Blech..."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, especially for Health lunch! Quick, hot lunch line style menu with 3 vegan and 1 chicken dish to choose from + rice and bread. The food was better than all of the indian restaurant lunch buffets in oakland. Very cheap. I would go back."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this but this is Indian food at its worst. I feel really bad about being so harsh but the food could have been anything but Indian. 
Greasy, spicy , tasteless food apart from the Samosa which actually tasted nice. 
Tried the vegan meal which had 3 entrees , brown rice and flat bread .
Here goes the food review-
The brown rice - nothing to write about 
Flatbread supposed to serve as Naan bread - surely bought from a Walmart type store - not even heated up . Just bad 
The chickpeas - decent 
The cauliflower and peas were just floating in oil 
The samosa - surprisingly likable ! 

Most of the reviews have been positive for this restaurant- maybe this was just a one off bad day"}
{"text":"Consistent quality, I have been getting takeout from Sree's for several years and it is always perfect at an affordable price. The Chicken Biryani is flavorful with tender chicken and you can never go wrong with a side of Chickpea Potato. Unlike many Indian buffets and full service restaurants, her menu is limited and that makes it nice. You know what you're going to get."}
{"text":"If you work downtown, if you're vegan, or if you just are craving a quick indian meal on your lunch hour, this is the place.  It's cheap.  It's fast.  And the food isn't anything to laugh about.  It's not as spicy as I would prefer but I love the price and the ease of being able to stroll in and stroll out in under 10 min.  The owner has always offered advice on what to try if you're new to the whole idea.  This is a downtown staple and a favorite of many downtown workers."}
{"text":"(06/14/2011) A great gem in the middle of dahntahn.  Don't be scared off by the looks of the place, shoehorned into a wedge-shped building with a dowdy interior (green plastic and cotton-flocked tablecloths, grayed vinyl floor a la your grade school cafeteria); dining in is a little awkward (communal tables lining the walls).  The food is pretty good -- the dishes remind me of when I would go to my friend's mom's and be invited to stay for an impromptu dinner.  Sree's does vegetables better than they do meat, go vegan; the chicken breast is dry and stringy, even though it's sauced.  Had the grape leaves curry (tangy), chickpeas and potatoes (creamy gold potatoes), aromatic cauliflower.  Lots of warming heat and mix of spices in the curries; sauce nicely sopped by a piece of naan (although the naan seemed commercial).  Some of the vegetables obviously from a frozen, pre-prepped product (carrots,broccoli) or canned (chickpeas), but who doesn't have those staples in their pantry; you can't beat the price ($6 for 3 sides and rice), and it's thoroughly satisfying."}
{"text":"I miss Sree's wagon at CMU. $3 for a LARGE lunch: two veggies curries, a daal, and some nan (nan is not the greattest but not bad), and that was in 1999. He made a dish called carrot methi that I have tried, without success, to reproduce, and have found nowhere else. I would usually eat 1/2 for lunch and take 1/2 home for dinner, which...eating largely on $3 a day anywhere is almost impossible.

I don't think he had any meat options at CMU, at least not back then.

Looks like the prices have gone up to $5 since then- still an amazing deal."}
{"text":"I used to skip school to go to this place. I feel like the people who give bad reviews dont really get the place- its 5 bucks for a heap of vegan indian food, and your complaining about the decor? Obviously you can go pay more fot indian food downtown if you want nan and basmati rice, but its not gonna be vegan since all the dishes are cooked with ghee, and no one is going to be as awesome as mrs. sree. 
This is my favorite place to eat in pittsburgh not beacause its the fanciest or most painstaikingly crafted food, but because of the value, heartiness and comfort it brings me.
My tip would be to go on monday, wednesday or friday. I mostly eat there on those days, (even though the grape leaf curry.has grown on me) beacause that is when I can get the tofu, chickpeas, and either tomato dal or blackeye pea.with spinach.  Other days you may not find the same level of delish....
Also, last time I went they switched back to the triangle shaped tofu! I love it!"}
{"text":"I am definitely no expert on Indian food, but since this this place serves nothing that even resembles that, I feel qualified to offer my thoughts..  Once you get past the dismal decor of the \"restaurant\" itself and figure maybe the food will at least be ok, you get a dish slapped into a takout plate by a pleasant woman. It all goes downhill from there.  I ordered the vegan lunch which consisted of Eggplant , Tofu and Vegetables and Tomato and Lentils over rice.  All three were substandard.  The eggplant was ok, but did not appear to be fresh..was visually unappealing and basically not good.  

The lentils and tomato served over mushy brown rice (not basmati), was light on both tomatoes and lentils but was passable as food.  But by far the worst was the tofu.  Large cubes swimming in a disgusting broth were like sponges of awfulness.  Biting into one resulted in a gushing of water that looked like it came out of the Ganges river, (thereby establishing it's only tangential connection to authentic Indian food.). Thank Annapurna (the Hindu God of food and cooking),  for the half a slice of whole wheat pita that was laying on top of the rest of this slop.

My understanding from what others tell me is there are better things to order on other days of the week. But I don't plan to return ...maybe when it eventually becomes a Subway or Starbucks.   

Hoping I don't get sick.

{"text":"Vegan lunches are amazing, dosas are great, Mrs. Srees the best. Best Indian hotsauce in the city."}
{"text":"This is strictly \"ok\" place. There's no naan. It's the wheat off-the-shelf pita.  The tamarind chicken was good/better than average (which is why the 3 stars).  The chickpea (\"chhole\") were a bad average.  Rice was standard (non-basmati). The price was less than $6.  The seating was skeletal (not fancy at all).  

I would actually want to give it 2.5 stars.  Definitely not worth the 4-star rating that it has.  It is family-owned so you should support this place."}
{"text":"Its fast and very cheap. I've never had bad Indian food but this was not my favorite. I suspect that the quality of the food varies daily as they have a limited menu. Ill probably give it another try as they may have better food on another day"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an inexpensive meal, this is your place. If you're looking for an inexpensive meal that looks like it scared away the health inspector, this is also your place. Despite the disheveled, unclean, and initially frightening appearance, I said hey, I'll give it a try. 

To be honest if you love spicy food, you might enjoy Sree's. In my opinion the food was too spicy and all other favors were lost in the shuffle. I moved on to the rice, unfortunately one of the sides was on top and the rice was completely drowned in curry. If that's your style, more power to you. Personally I was not a fan."}
{"text":"One of the few things, in the culinary sense, that I really miss about Pitt that B-lo doesn't have an equivalent of - basically Indian fast food that is somehow still very fresh and authentic, chanelled through a mom'n'pop diner meets food stand idea. A tiny hole in the wall with decor that is nothing to write home about, Sree's serves amazing, super cheap, largely vegan-friendly cuisine in huge portions that someone like myself can easily get tow or three meals out of. The staff (which consisted of Sree and his wife when I was there) were always very friendly and often kicked in extra bread or other complimentary items for regulars. This was a weekly stop for me when I was on a tight budget, teaching at Shuman Juvenile Detention center and living in Squirrel Hill back in the day. When I'm in town again I will need to make a special trip!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant once and will never go back. Extremely cheap food both price wise and quality wise. They basically scoop what color food you want out of 2 troughs. I like Indian food. This is very very low quality indian food."}
{"text":"In the landscape of food options downtown, Sree's represents one of the best time/$/value ratios around.

Time = Sree's usually has a small line inside, but the one or two staff members always push everyone through efficiently with great service and a very open and caring persona.  Even in the height of the lunch rush, you never have any hidden surprises when you're in need of a quick grab and go.

$ = Under $6 for an entire box of quality food...  check.  I can't think of many places that offer you more, good quality food at this price point.

Value = Sree's has some solid flavors.  While not the best Indian I've ever had, it definitely delivers in the well-sought after spice department.  I typically order the chicken, and take the staff's suggestion for the vegetable of the day (usually three or four options).  They also offer a hearty vegetarian plate and samosas that deliver on expectations.

A few notes...  if you like to sweat (like I do), Sree's has a slow-burn hot sauce that pairs well with everything you can order.  Also, seating, while scarce, does the job if you aren't looking to have a conversation (tables are placed up against the walls)."}
{"text":"I'm going back. I had the vegan lunch. I liked the spice level. It seems authentic and healthy."}
{"text":"Its as good as it gets.

No frills Indian food.  Cheap and plentiful.  Friendly, quick service.  I love this place.  if you are a vegan its perfect for you but the chicken dishes are fantastic also.  Give it a try...at 6 dollars a plate it cant be beat."}
{"text":"Sree's is a staple of my downtown Pittsburgh lunch diet. For $5 you get chicken + 1 veg or 3 veg curries with rice and pita. While the chicken is delicious and a pretty huge portion, it's a bit greasy so I usually opt for 3 vegetable curries. Of the vegetables, they always have a chickpea potato one plus three other rotating varieties, including -- off the top of my head -- tomato dal, grapeleaves, mixed veg tofu, cauliflower tomato, spinach potato, eggplant. I'm a fan of the tomato dal.  A lot of the curries have a rather sour acidic flavor, but pretty tasty.

The pita is completely pointless and you're better off forgoing it (for extra rice if you want). If they had nan I might give it another star.

The downtown location is only open for lunch, with very limited seating -- it's mainly set up for quick take-out."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Pittsburgh and had no groceries and was still grossed out by the perma grime left on my stove from the previous tenant, I pretty much went out for lunch downtown everyday. I am a big fan of Indian food and a big a cheap skate so Sree Foods was a perfect fit for me.

This place is no BS and the most unpretentious hole in the wall kind of dive you'll ever find. You go in with $5 and you get a styrofoam container and an elderly Indian lady gives you a big heep of amazing vegan Indian food. There's usually three vegan dishes and one chicken dish. They give you a little bit of all of the available dishes and throw it together in one container. They finally then throw in a piece of naan that is like the Indian equivalent of Wonder Bread but the great dishes make up for it.

It is a cash only spot and like I said, just $5 for this daily lunch special, and $1 extra for a pop. One thing to beware of is that they fill up your styrofoam container to the max. Sometimes the food starts to leak out, so if you don't want an unnecessary dry cleaner run, be careful."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch-only spot downtown.  $6 gets you the daily special (typically Tamarind Chicken) or the vegan option, one of the many delicious side dishes (today was eggplant, last week it was green beans), a heaping spoonful of rice, and some naan bread.  I really like this place - you get consistently prepared, delicious food every time.    Nothing fancy, but always delicious and reliable."}
{"text":"For $5 you cannot beat this lunch deal. You get the chicken along with two sides (I would get grape leaves and chick peas) and the bread. Trust me when I tell you it fills you up. The downtown hours are limited so make sure you are there before 3pm"}
{"text":"YES YES YES YES

One of my favorite lunch spots downtown.  $5 delicious Indian food cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Sree's is the best value for sumptuous, healthy food I have ever encountered. They do a fantastic job of balancing low price with high quality food. I don't give it 5 stars because it is a Michelin grade restaurant, but rather because they so successfully provide healthy, flavorful food at a very affordable price. This is not where you go for a special occasion, but it is where you go frequently if you love Indian food and like to eat a healthy diet -- especially, but not exclusively, if you are vegetarian or vegan (they do offer chicken alternatives)."}
{"text":"Pakistani Love!! The Spicy Chicken Hyderabadi and Cauliflower with Tomato and Butter Beans Lunch Special was amazing!!  This is home cooking!!"}
{"text":"Aww...Mr. and Mrs. Sree, I know that you can do better. I want you to. 

I was really disappointed to be eating vegetables that came from a can last Monday. It brought back (bad) memories of my mom's pop-open-a-can-dash-of-salt culinary style, or as my partner mentioned -- cafeteria food complete with the no-nonsense service. The green beans were nostalgically plain and the carrots were very oily. The spices were not very distinct in any of the dishes. And the pita on the side was an unwelcome touch. 

The cost matters much less to me than flavor. I could buy a more satisfying array of canned goods at the grocery store for $5, while I would happily pay $10 for a quality authentic Indian style lunch. 

I am sure that Sree's is highly convenient for those who work (or live in a box) downtown, and for those poor souls, I recommend that you at least bring your own container to save the styrofoam."}
{"text":"What is with the good reviews? I swear this woman must pay these people to write them. The place is discusting. Absolutely dreadful. The place is old and towels hang up to block the mess of the kitchen in the back. The food is in old equipment from the 70s and the owner wears these soft hand casts that look like they havent been washed in years. The bottles on the tables literally have crust on them like they havent been washed and the atmosphere is old and moldy.

The food is way overpowered by spices to cover up the lack of quality in the meats and vegetables. I am all for spicy food but I could not even finish my meal. I've gone to this place 3 times now and figured I had a bad batch and that I needed to try other things to figure out what these reviews were all about. Nope! Every time I left dissapppinted. Even the Naan is fake! She buys store bought cheap pita bread. 

Seriously I'm surprised that she passes the health inspection. If you want good indian food, Id try going to the buffets on 6th ave. Definitely way better bang for your buck. And your not questioning what is in your food."}
{"text":"Sree's advertises \"curry in a hurry\". The place is reminiscent of an elementary school cafeteria: A small sign with today's options, a hot food line, with up to two people behind the buffet scooping orders into styrofoam boxes, and a cash register. Along the sides, there is bench seating, all complete with plastic utensil holders, paper towel rolls, and squeeze-bottles filled with a delicious and very spicy hot sauce.

If nothing else, the place is a bargain: $5 will get you the styrofoam box full of food - be it a large portion of Tamarind Chicken, or a selection of 3 out of 4 daily vegetarian offerings. Along with that, two big scoops of white rice and 'naan'(really, half of a cold white-flour pita).

The quality is where I feel really leaves desired, though. The food sits out, the the ingredients often taste canned, or otherwise processed. While the food has more flavor than, say, a Subway sandwich, I feel that as far as Indian food goes it is rather bland, unless you put enough hot sauce on it.

Taking this place for what it is, cheap indian food, it is a stop that is nice to your appetite and your wallet. If you don't work nearby, though, it's not worth a trip."}
{"text":"Sree's offers an exceptional value. For $5 you get enough food to fill up even a 6'5\" guy like me! It is all prepared with quality and freshness of ingredients in mind. Some Indian food is prepared way too spicy. Sree's food is absolutely authentic Hyderabad style, and you can enjoy it without being overwhelmed by hotness! I first went to the Sree's in Squirrel Hill in 1996, now I frequent the downtown location. Another thing that is nice about this place is that it's a family affair. When I went in today Sree's very congenial wife Vydehi was serving the food, her mother was on the cash register and their delightful daughter Sreethanaya was sitting at a little table eating lunch. I highly recommend Sree's - 4 STARS! BTW please pray for Sree. He's been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) so he can use all of our prayers. For more information on Sree's visit their website: http://www.srees.com/"}
{"text":"I visited this location in the mid 90s when I lived in Sq. Hill. Sree was always so friendly and accommodating. Love the tamarind chicken and the chickpeas dish. For only $5 you get an extremely good value. This is not high end Indian cuisine, it's South Indian (Hyderabad) style food that is found in millions of Indian homes every day!"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food at a great price. Even better if you go on a Tuesday or Thursday for samosas. Owner is super nice too! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Step into Sree's Foods on an unassuming corner in the cultural district of Pittsburgh and it's like having lunch at a friend's house. Sree himself serves up vegan Indian food buffet style in what appears to be a one-man operation. There is a chicken option for those who want it, but most of it is strictly vegan with no dairy served. Hey, that means no Palak Paneer! Oh well, The food was pretty good and I'd definitely go back. Sree gives generous portions too, so you might want to wait a few hours before getting dinner there. Right near the convention center."}
{"text":"I started working in downtown Pittsburgh about a month ago and have been looking for a place to grab reasonable lunch when I don't have time to pack.  Sree's fits the bill.

I often eat vegetarian and chose to try out three of their entrees.  The grape leaves were by far the best with fresh, lively flavors.  The chickpeas and mixed veggies, while also good, were fairly bland.  I do appreciate that the food is not greasy, many of the other options in Pittsburgh hit the stomach hard with grease.

Lastly, and while I hesitate to use strong words here, the naan is pitiful.  It is strikingly food-service-esque."}
{"text":"I know some people are crazy about Sree's, but I ate here for the first time today and I thought it was meh. I like the simplicity - one meat dish, one vegetarian dish, pick from 3 entrees, but I didn't really enjoy anything about the dish or the place. The server was really nice, so that's a plus. I ended up only eating about half of it and then went to au Bon pain for a soup."}
{"text":"What?!?!  I haven't written a review for this place yet!  I've been enjoying Sree's food for years while working dowtown.  It used to be $5 for a huge portion of food but I think they raised the price to $5.50 plus tax which you still can't beat for what you're getting.  

I usually get the chicken and chick peas - always tasty and never disappointed!  The staff including the Sree's are sooooo friendly.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a flavorful lunch on a budget."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, back when Mr. Sree was alive (Wonderful Man by the way) And I get that some people are like OMG it looks terrible, I don't know what I am eating yadda yadda. What I don't think these people understand is that this is not your commercial Indian food. Its your Indian equivalent of moms home cooking, and that's what we (the positive reviewers of this place) like. If you don't like it fine, but don't bad mouth the place. And to the dude saying she has fake naan. She never says its naan, she says plain and simple that its a pita. I love this place, and go at least twice a week. If you don't like the spice or its too overpowering for you. That's cool, just know that its packed everyday around lunch."}
{"text":"For super quick and super cheap Indian, this is it.

Best thing: it's $5. I don't mean $5, plus tax. I mean you hand them a $5 bill, take your trough of Indian food, and go on your merry way.

Here's the deal:
Option One: chicken + one vegan side
Option Two: three vegan sides
All options come with rice and bread (would call it a \"fluffy\" version of naan)

They also have treats like samosas and byrani rice once in a while.  I guess it's on some sort of set schedule, but I can't remember it (besides, that isn't as fun as walking in to see what they have made that day!)

I'm no vegan, but their vegan dishes are amazing (and spicy!)

Tomato lentils is by far my favorite"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I thought it was going to be better. At its price it's good,but paying a few dollars more gets you better Indian in PGH. Sweet woman owns and operates the store. But please try it and give her some support"}
{"text":"In the midst of a culinary hell downtown, Sree's shines. Really lovely staff, great food, and extremely reasonable prices. 

If you like good Indian food, go here."}
{"text":"I just finished having lunch here for the first time. I've never had indian food before. A coworker recommended Srees. I had the spicy chicken and grapeleaves with cauliflower and it was delicious! And seriously, only $5.89?? I will definitely be back with friends and family."}
{"text":"$5 you can't beat this place.  You get either tamarind chicken and rice with a vegan side, or three vegan dishes with rice.  the potato with chickpeas is very good.  otherwise, the sides tend to be on the bland side."}
{"text":"Mrs Sree now makes fresh of the griddle dosa (South Indian crepe which is vegan and gluten free). Inside for a filling is potato curry and you get a side of coconut chutney and homemade soup (sambar). This lunch is my fav and fills you up but does not make you sleepy. Allthis for just $6, it cannot be beat. I will also go on Tuesday and Thursday for her homemade samosa (pastry with spiced potato and peas filling).
This place is the best."}
{"text":"Cheap vegan fair, they also usually have a chicken option. Drinks are reasonably priced. Pricing is good, food is tasty."}
{"text":"My star rating is based mainly on the food. It's the poorest quality Indian food I've had in the city. I would call it 'food court' Indian.  The up side is that you get a huge styrofoam container of your choice of two entrees, rice & 'nan' (I think its just heated up pita) and its only $5, worth it. If you are a vegan downtown looking for a quick cheap meal, might be one of only options (besides Moe's & Frankturary) another plus is the service is nice & quick."}
{"text":"I got the chicken lunch, and was really hoping for good, fast, cheap Indian food close to my apartment. I got mushy brown rice, pita bread instead of naan, and a rather large bug next to my chicken. I wanted to like it, but I can't get past the bug :("}
{"text":"Had an appointment nearby. Stopped to check this place out for lunch. Pleasantly surprised. Good food at a great price! No disappointments here. Will visit again if in that area."}
{"text":"Like its other locations downtown and by CMU, this Squirrel Hill storefront offers food for a bargain.  For $6, you can get rice and all four of the vegetarian (vegan, too, I think) dishes OR rice, the chicken, and two of the veggie selections.  The portions are huge, and can feed you two days in a row if you've got a good appetite, or maybe even three days in a row.  Unlike the other locations, the Squirrel Hill branch only serves dinner, and only Monday-Friday.

The four vegetarian dishes available the day I visited were a dal, spinach with black-eyed peas, chickpeas and potatoes, and tofu with mixed veggies.  Of the four, I disliked the tofu and mixed veggies--I'm a fan of tofu, but this tofu was way too spongy.  The other three selections were all right, though not spicy at all and too liquid-y.  As other reviewers have remarked about the other locations, the naan was really a piece of store-bought flatbread that tasted a little stale to me.

Does Sree's have the best Indian food?  No.  Is it one of the best options for dinner in Squirrel Hill?  No.  Is it worth the money, if you're on a tight budget and want something fast and filling?  Yes."}
{"text":"Affordable, family-run and DELICIOUS.  Very veggie friendly, too.  Makes downtown lunchtime my happy place."}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly, the crowd is always happy, the food is tasty, healthy, and inexpensive.  I can't ask more of a restaurant.

Open for lunch only, Sree's serves four fully vegan vegetarian dishes and one chicken dish daily.  Choose chicken + one veggie or three veggie dishes for $5.

The menu repeats weekly; that is, every Monday has the same options, every Tuesday has a different set of options, and so on.  The menu changes up from season to season; currently, the menthi carrots (Monday) and aloo saag (spinach potato, Thursday) are my two favorites.  

The food is cooked off-site, and brought into this small space for lunch daily.  Sree and his family have three other locations, including a full restaurant in Sharpsburg.

Probably the healthiest, tastiest, and best value in all of Downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Sree's is probably the cheapest place to eat downtown and still feel like you're getting a great deal.  There are lots of cheap places downtown, but they usually leave something to be desired.  Not Sree's!

It's $5, and you get Tamarind Chicken(at least every time I've been there, that's the only meat option, but it might change..) a vegetarian option over rice, with a piece of Naan.  The owner (Sree) runs the joint, and he'll tell you what to try and what not to try.  

Definitely worth the lunchtime walk.  I only go once or twice a month, due to the real or perceived lack of variety."}
{"text":"The best place ! You can't get a great lunch like this for the price in the city. I've never been disappointed in the 7 plus years that I've been eating here! Service with a smile!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Sree's more than I did.  Ray and I stopped in a day or two prior to the G20 summit when downtown was virtually a ghost town (kinda like a weekend day in Pgh, but this was a Wednesday).  It's a small place in a V shaped building with two entrances.  Ray and I walk in for the first time and no one really is in the spot (again G20).  The tables are on both sides of the building facing the wall with paper towels and plastic silverware, hot sauce scattered around.  There is an extremely pleasant indian lady behind the heated trays who greets us warmly with a broad smile and a pleasant demeanor (this is one of the reasons I wanted to rate this place better).  The meals are very cheap at $5 for the chicken curry, rice and another vegetable (think some type of chick pea).  I also appreciate their selection of drinks which includes coconut water.  I kinda had an idea what I was gonna be in for when I looked at the sad bread.  I was expecting roti or naan, but this was cold semi stale pita.  We have a seat and being somewhat of a curry maven I look forward to a flavorful lunch, but sadly the meat is somewhat dry and the curry lacks any real flavor or spice.  The rice is fine and I've already commented on the pita.  The chick pea side had a little more flavor, but still nothing close to good.  The lady was so endearing that I almost gave the place three stars, however the food really was sub par.  I can only imagine they are specifically tailoring this food to the masses who want cheap food and are only dabbling in indian flavors with the tamed down flavor level.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Overall Impression: 
A true staple of what Indian home cooking really is.

The Food:
Not only is there an all-vegan option for her lunch making it friendly to special diets, but the menu changes every day to cycle through her amazing dishes and provide new offerings to newcomers. My personal favorite is Tuesday, where she makes homemade samosas (to die for) and has one of my favorite side-dishes, grape leaves! In my most recent visit, I ordered the Large Meal (because I'm worth it) which included Hyderabadi (Spicy) Chicken, grape leaves with mixed vegetables, and Tomato Dal--all over a bed of rice with plenty of different curries to go around. Some of her curries are similar in taste and relatively spicy, but some of the vegetables are less so, like her green beans, and baby eggplant. Just make sure to ask her which ones are which. I do feel like the different curry could have more depth of flavor to separate them from each other, but that would be my only suggestion of improvement.

The Restaurant:
When you walk into Ms. Sree's, don't be put off by the cafeteria-style set up or the old equipment she uses--I assure you I've eaten there at least once a week and I'm still alive! She always makes sure to greet you when you walk in, and always asks how your day is going. She gives me all the grandma feels, and it's backed up by her overall sweetness and appreciation for her customers. There is a collection of photos of her late husband on the wall, who also used to work at the restaurant (before my time), and I'm sure she still keeps the place open as an honor to him, which gives me even more feels. (I'm not crying, you're crying!). The menu itself is very well-priced. I've never paid more than $9.50 for a meal, and that's when I'm being gluttonous. The amount of food you receive for that price is well worth it, adding even more value to her home-style cuisine. 

TL;DR
Ms. Sree is my go-to for my Indian food cravings, which occur at least once a week. She has me addicted to the wonderful spice pallet and grandma-style food. If you're into commercial Indian cooking, which is what most people are used to, you'll see from fellow reviewers that you'll be disappointed that it's not typical by any means--but to me, that's the best part."}
