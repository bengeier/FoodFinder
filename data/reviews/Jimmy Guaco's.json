{"text":"Jimmy Guaco's was a relief to find because I was so used to mucho and burrito boyz. I got their halal chicken burrito, and it tasted great! All the ingredients are fresh, and contribute to that nice fresh, spicy flavour you should expect to get when you buy a burrito. Definitely going to become a regular here."}
{"text":"One of the better burritos in durham. Beats mucho burrito any day. Choice of fresh toppings and staff usually make recommendations if needed. I keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Have been several times and am a fan. Have had the chicken and chorizo - both delicious. Lots of veggies and extras to load up your burrito, all fresh and tasty. The small burrito is actually quite huge so a great deal. Only small complaint I have is they charge the same for a burrito bowl as a large burrito and that thing has way more in it..burrito bowl is a lot of lettuce. All in all a great find, so much better than M4 (which is bland and boring) and Burritoville (not a lot of toppings and quite filthy the last time I was there)."}
{"text":"Jimmy Guaco's is an excellent burrito shop. The menu is great, lots of selection.  The quality of fresh ingredients is second to no other burrito shop that I have tried.  Burrito sizes are great and will definitely fill you up.  Absolutely recommend making this your go-to burrito shop!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today. Even though they included a free nachos which was nice, everything else was unpleasant. The staff were very unattentive and noisy. They left most of the work to one older woman. They did not explain the toppings well. No napkins are readily available. After waiting for five minutes with no one around, they finally gave me my burrito. When i asked for napkins for my wife and I, they gave me exactly two. Burritos were poorly made and very soggy. The ingredients did actually taste good though. It's too bad, i usually like this place but probably won't be coming back. If they paid more attention to detail and staff training, perhaps they could turn it around."}
{"text":"Been a long time Guaco's customer but disappointed with recent menu changes; Taco Tuesday used to be awesome but now it's just a waste of a lunch hour. The burritos have gone down hill a little but are still good. Staff are always phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have been to burrito boys, mucho burrito and Jimmy G's. None of it compares with the quality go Jimmy Guaco's ingredients, awesome taste and original combinations.
I feel the Whitby staff can use a bit more training vs. the Oshawa location but still awesome."}
{"text":"Best burrito I have had in a while. Very busy restaurant. Quick and friendly servers but a slow process. But it was worth the wait. Yum"}
{"text":"Came to this location after we read the rave reviews of the oshawa location.  Really enjoyed the food,  and considered it better than mucho burrito."}
{"text":"Yum!! Enough said. 
Love this place. My choice is the Chicken and Chorizo Burrito! Ingredients are fresh, staff are friendly and the burritos are delish! Been back many times and will be back many more times."}
{"text":"My wife and tried this place today and enjoyed in very much. The staff were friendly and our Burritos were excellent, we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Good Burritos.... But don't get the Nachos!!!!  
A very small portion for what you pay for.
Also I asked for no Olives.... And there were olives in it !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After lacklustre performance at the nearby Mucho Burrito, we were anxiously awaiting the opening of Jimmy Guacos. Gotta say Jimmy Guacos did not disappoint. Staff are friendly. Ingredients are fresh. The nachos are surreal! Tons of queso cheese and toppings on the Nachos. Burritos are huge. We usually get the fish. It's fried and made fresh. Only trouble is that it's super busy at meal times. However, that's the cost of a good product. We continue to be regulars. Would totally recommend."}
{"text":"This place has racist old lady that is hard to hate at the same time. Get this amazing experience we had. I go in to order and get the looks that I don't belong there. Was asked by so called sweet old lady what I want. So I tell her 4 burritos. From there u get asked about the names. Once I told her my name she frowned and mumbled NICE NAME. It all went down hill from there ? Step it up ppl we can't keep having this hatred spreading with no accountability whatsoever"}
{"text":"Very good burritos at a fair price. Not a sit in type place, but great for take out. Nice parks across the street where you can sit and enjoy your burrito. Tons of choices of toppings and meat. Friendly staff that will take their time to make your burrito perfect and not make you feel rushed.
Their house sauce is the bomb.
Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the \"Soup Nazi\" old lady. We tried to ask her to not include chorizo or some random ingredient like that (don't really remember) on the \"burrito of the day\" that was advertised at the door, she said \"we can't do modifications, you should order a different one\". Tried to explain myself that it was about the deal, she just kept yelling at us about not doing modifications, wouldn't even let us finish talking. Yeah, no thanks. They have good variety and it tastes good but Mucho Burrito on the other side of Baldwin is also good and you don't get treated like shit."}
{"text":"It's one of the only places I like for burritos. They have lots of ingredients and choices. I think it is a bit expensive but one small burrito fills me up fine. 
I would recommend it even though not many people know about it or like it that much."}
{"text":"I came here because of the good reviews, but i came out disappointed. Did I really just spent 16$ for a burrito and a coke? The burrito was mostly rice and chorizo, garnishes were meager, no trace of the fresh guacamole they advertised. Employees were bickering while I was eating in an otherwise empty restaurant. Sad.
I miss San Fransisco's Mission burritos."}
{"text":"I've been to other jimmy guaco's were the food is on point and they treat you like family. I also know this app is for food reviews only but still  you need a lil love or frendliness  when you get your food.  it makes ten  times better when you get you meal from some one that greats you like a friend or like family. any way now for the review of the food it wasn't that great stake bareto was under cooked that's a bout it lol"}
{"text":"Really good tacos! I'm surprised that I never found this gem before.
Staff is friendly, food is good, service is fast and it's cheap.
Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Fresh and always delicious! Baja fish is my favorite. This is my first time at this location and it's every bit as good as the original."}
{"text":"The employees are so unprofessional and noisy carrying on personal conversations while customers wait in line. And we were given one napkin each!
Burritos are tasty for the Whitby area but they would do better to go back using tinfoil to wrap the burrito. We got a free nacho with a small burrito."}
{"text":"Jimmy Guaco's has THE best fast-food burritos in town. The quality and freshness of their ingredients is amazing. I always get a chicken burrito and it's absolutely delicious every time. I have also ordered the chicken quesadilla and it's also delicious. Upon my recent visit, I decided to try something new - the nachos. The nachos here are even more filling than any other place. That's because instead of chips, they use sweet potato waffle fries. On the risk of sounding repetitive, these were also delicious. In case you haven't been able to detect a pattern here, definitely go to Jimmy Guacos... because it's delicious."}
{"text":"After a long work day I decided to end my day off by getting my Mexican fix. Scouting Yelp for something different from the usual chain Mexican restaurants, I came across this place and decided to check it out. They have what you'd typically find at a Tex-Mex place but I decided to stay familiar and order a chicken burrito. 

Firstly, I should say that service wasn't the best and I was served an unwanted side of sass with my burrito regardless, I came for food and not service apparently. I ordered the largest size chicken burrito they had (which was a huge mistake) and each bite was filled with regret and me wishing I had just gone somewhere else. My meal was rather tasteless and the blaring top 40's music didn't help affairs much either. I would say I ate roughly three-quarters off the burrito before I cut my losses and just left. 

I hate to sound negative, but I REALLY don't recommend you try this place, unless you somehow have to."}
{"text":"Such good burritos! Excellent selection for choices and sizes, fillings toppings...mmmmm just thinking about the place is making me hungry. No where else can I get the chicken and shrimp burrit. They also don't charge extra for guacamole which I love. The food is always fresh the service is quick and price is reasonable for the amount of food you get. Also I love how they have a loyalty card!"}
{"text":"went once, wont go back. The line up was incredibly long, the service was slow. Food was just ok a best. Mucho Burrito definitely uses better quality ingredients. I'll be going there instead from now on."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and occasionally hit or miss.  I feel like this place has gone down hill and the burritos have become so bland.   I will recommend the quesadilla"}
{"text":"This is our go-to burrito joint and for good reason!!

We come here at least once a month for lunch. My hubby always gets a different kind of burrito and I've taken to getting the nachos. The nachos come with lots of toppings, sour cream and cheese sauce (if you're getting takeout, ask for them on the side, keeps it from getting soggy), guac,green onions, tomatoes, green peppers, black olives and hot peppers (I skip these last two). I've had it with the lattice fries and with the nachos and both are good but I prefer the crunch of the nachos. Get the regular size, the small is just too small!

And if you're lucky and they have the turtles cookies, get some! they're INCREDIBLE and always fresh baked, sooo delicious. Chocolate cookie with chocolate chunks and chunks of caramel or something... YUM, they're SINFUL.

The main criticism I have of this place is how bloody long it takes to get your food. You can easily spend half an hour all in if you're ordering more than one thing and there's even one or two people in front of you. They really need to speed the process up and get more efficient at serving customers in a timely manner and the staff needs to do better at working TOGETHER to serve customers. Still, the food is delicious and we keep coming back. Worth a stop and waaaay better than Mucho across the street."}
{"text":"If you think Mucho Burrito uses fresher ingredients, I have some pig slop to sell you at a great price.  Jimmy Guacos is awesome.  And doesn't charge extra for guacamole!  I wouldn't let my dog eat in Mucho Burrito on the good chance she'd end up eating a relative.  Went there once, the food was slop, and the employees were rude and constantly trying to upsell.  I'd rather stand in a line for two hours at Jimmy Guacos than eat free food at Mucho Burrito"}
{"text":"Quite simply the best burrito in town. Fresh and tasty ingredients. Great service and right next to a park for some summer sun! Love it! Open more locations please!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I am biased because I looove burritos, but I really love this place! Though the price tag can be a bit much, you are paying for a solid amount of food that is delicious and ready quickly. 

The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I particularly like how little time it takes to get a good meal here. Oftentimes after work, I just want to stuff a burrito into my face hole and this business provides the perfect opportunity to do that. The burrito always has a good portion of both meat and rice and this is not one of those cheap \"all rice and no meat\" type places. The food is ready in minutes and can be customized so that you have it exactly the way you want it. The staff members are always interesting and friendly to chat with while you are waiting, and the bathrooms are clean. 

This is the perfect place to get a quick, delicious, and filling burrito if you have a few extra dollars to spare."}
{"text":"Burritos here are excellent and they have interesting combinations I've never dreamed of in a burrito!  Free Guacamole as it should be, unlike mucho across the street.  Try the sweet potato!  Awesome!"}
