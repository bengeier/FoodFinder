{"text":"Abby's has great food at a great price!  The service is very good and very friendly.  This is a perfect spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Joe, the owner, makes homemade soups that are absolutely amazing.  Abby's is quick, inexpensive and tasty.  It's a great place to kick back with the family and enjoy a quality meal.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Abby's has great food at a great price.  It is a nice family place because it is casual and unpretentious.  You can't beat the price on the specials!"}
{"text":"Awful breakfast and the service is worse! The \"steak\" for their steak and eggs was the thinnest cut I've seen outside a Philly Cheesesteak. It was overdone, over seasoned, and overpriced. Hashbrowns were the frozen shred kind and drowned in butter.  I went because they had a Groupon but won't go back if it were free."}
{"text":"It wouldn't be fair to expect Abby's to be what it isn't. It's a fine little breakfast and lunch spot with European groceries and gifts. 

Our hostess, Flo, is a pip. The cook does a fine job making what's on the menu. (We don't really know whose hair that was under the potatoes.) And the menu IS extensive. It is, however, important to read the menu before ordering. Who knew, without reading the menu, that the corned beef sandwich was going to come with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise? (That was surprising, but would not have been if I had read the menu and seen that all those sandwiches come that way.)

The pastrami omelet was light on meat and did include American cheese (probably noted on the menu, but, well, you know). The frozen shredded potatoes were done up just fine. 

And there you go! For not a lot of money you have a huge menu, great service--and entertainment, and you can pick up obscure Eastern European staples and treats while there! 

Oh, and any place with a TV automatically loses a star, so that's why the two."}
{"text":"I was on my way to another place for lunch and saw a Now Open sign. I have to admit that usually is enough to get me to stop by. This one was attached to a deli, cafe, grill. I had to. 

It is a European market with a grill and seating area attached. I opted for the Boars Head corned beef on a Lepina bread over the Rye. Good choice. The bread was awesome. I had a bowl of bean and bacon soup that totally hit the spot on a cold day like today. 

The owners are really nice and love to hear feedback."}
{"text":"Cheap and Easy, you don't get a better lunch than this place. The burgers are on point, the Rueben is to die for, and the tuna melt is out of this world. 

If you get a chance stop in and check out their market too. I don't know much about some of the stuff they had, but I can only imagine that someone is going to call this place a gold mine of European food."}
{"text":"Good breakfast specials. Very low key atmosphere.

Expect little service- which is fine.

Weekends, not suggested...Weekday mornings is when the food is the best !

They supposedly have some special coffee, but couldnt seem to get me any, or know any thing about it."}
{"text":"We needed some work done on our car and didn't know how long it would take so we walked over to Abby's for breakfast. I did my research ahead of time and knew it was very nearby.

Okay, we are standing at the counter looking at the menu. My husband catches the eye of someone that works there. This guy stared a hole through my man the size of Venus. Instead of asking what we'd like to order he asks: Where are you from? Where do you live? How long have you been here? The interrogation annoyed me so I announce that I'll have the spinach omelet with wheat toast and a glass of orange juice. My voice snapped him out of his trance and he wrote down my order.

We sit ourselves in the dining room. There were about 7 or so people already seated. The crowd was very blue color, one guy even had a gun on his hip. The dining room is a spacious with tables placed throughout. It sorta reminded me of a banquet room with tables set up for a conference or a wedding reception or graduation party.

On to the food. My spinach omelet consisted of chopped, frozen spinach that was defrosted before it made it's way into my eggs. To my surprise, my omelet came with cheese.....American? I ate half of the omelet and half of the hash browns. Here comes the guy again to ask my husband more questions about his background and to peddle his Italian pastries that he can provide for special occasions. Seriously, I thought we were on some hidden video type program the way he couldn't take his eyes off my man. 

Overall, mediocre food."}
