{"text":"I was really hyped about going here, after reading all the positive reviews the expectations were high! Went last night and have to say it was quite the disappointment. Our cocktails weren't bad, but probably a bit too pricey for what we actually get. The service was horrible. We ordered guac and chips that didn't come, we had almost finished our drinks when we asked another server for our order. It finally arrived and then the music got way too loud that my friend and I couldn't even hear each other speak.oh ... and a warning to everyone that doesn't spend +$20. There is a $20 Min to pay by CC. Who does that? I'm giving it 2 stars for now, but might come back to try it out in summer so I could experience the live music and the patio and make my final judgement!"}
{"text":"I hosted an event last month in the private room at Reposado and could not have been more pleased with how it turned out.  The staff made planning the event simple by answering all of my questions in a timely fashion and offered great suggestions on how much food to provide.  All of my guests commented on how nice the bartenders and doorman were  and of course the food and drinks were delicious!  I have always loved going to Reposado and now that I know how great the private room is I will for sure be hosting another event there."}
{"text":"If you're a tequila fan you'd be hard pressed to find a better place in the city core. Huge variety to select from, and most mixes I've tried have been done very well. Only downside is that your bill can rack up pretty quickly, it's not a place for budget-seekers.   Bonus is that on some nights they have live music."}
{"text":"great bar, great jazz,  I appreciate the attention to detail...tasteful design....nice atmosphere. Wide selection of tequilas... and fine Djangoish (ok, not a word) swing jazz with a voice on the weekends."}
{"text":"Despite my aversion to tequila, I love this spot.  The margaritas are delicious, but I love to ask for an extra glass of ice so when the drink gets close to done (and a little too sour) you can dilute it.  The patio is awesome, and though the little seats look cool, they're actually awkward to sit at for more than 5 minutes.   Tried the food for the first time last night: ample servings and delicious.   My only hesitation on giving the spot 5 stars, is I find the pricing a little high."}
{"text":"How in the world have I never been here before? I love Reposado. It has a relaxed, laid back ambience (the bar staff hand you a menu and let you seat yourself). My friend and I chose a  table on the backyard patio, a tad on the small size, casual, and fitted with wooden bistro-size tables and chairs, as well as loungy stools and low tables for those who really want to relax.  At Reposado, you can learn everything you ever wanted to know about tequila (short of visiting a tequila factory in Mexico).  I enjoyed reading the menu descriptions, but opted for the margaritas instead of the tequila flights. I had the following:  -Reposado margarita: the classic margarita is done very well, and you can really taste the flavour of the tequila.  -Mango margarita: the sweet mango juice makes this go down very fast. Delicious.  -Chorizo and olive tapenade/crostini appetizer: a full tray of sliced spanish sausage, sauteed with thinly sliced green pepper, and a (tiny) bit of olive and feta tapenade to spread on baked crostini. My favourite appetizer of the night.  -Empanadas - a trio of chicken, vegetable and beef empanadas (appetizer size) with a side of fresh salsa. Very good.    -Crab cakes: delicious and deceivingly spicy; enhance the flavour with a splash of the lemon provided on the side.  The place could do with a few more food items on the menu, but I enjoyed their selection nonetheless.  After 10pm it's bar service only. The bar gets packed, the live music begins and you can either remain on the laid back patio or join the fun inside."}
{"text":"I went to Reposado with a group of friends on a Friday night in July. I really enjoy drinking tequila and the reviews on Yelp and Toronto Life compelled me to check it out.   Their selection of tequila is impressive. I asked the bartender's opinion on a few choices and he seemed knowledgeable enough. To be honest, a lot of their opinions sound very similar so if you're a complete beginner, don't expect to be given a Tequila 101. Just ask for an ounce of something anejo and you'll be fine. Don't sip the silver stuff unless you like making ridiculous faces in public.   I'm not sure if it was because of the numerous drinks I was having, or whether it was the impending heat wave in Toronto, but the bar was sweltering. I felt like I was sweating tequila bullets. There's outdoor space in the back for a patio, but there are walls surrounding the seating area so there is no breeze or wind at all. It was an improvement from indoors, but still not that comfortable. If you're going to be on a date, just don't wear something that will show your sweat marks!  The bar was busy but not too crowded. There was a friendly crowd there and the ambiance was cozy. It's not the cheapest place to have drinks but it is definitely unique and worth revisiting.   I tried the Don Julio 1942 Anejo and it was damned good (it's not actually made in 1942 though). For a 1.5 oz shot, it was $25. Instead of trying to pick tequilas based on how cool their bottle is, you can ask for a menu which lists all the options and their prices (the latter is important because we ordered a lot of the 1942 before we discovered the price)."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!    Reposado Bar & Lounge is a high-end establishment in a divey part of town, which makes visitors feel extremely cool and with it. The prices are high, but so is the quality of the bar and its tequila. You'll be surrounded by men wearing nice buttoned shirts and trendy blazers over their expensive jeans; and hot women wearing really nice dresses. The place feels a bit like a reception for a casual high-end wedding, if that's possible. My advice: take lots of money if you can, try a couple of exotic tequilas ($12-20 each), and sip away while you soak in the lovely patio and the beautiful people. I prefer places that are a bit more affordable and dressed down, but Reposado has a ton of potential.  4 stars"}
{"text":"I went to Reposado Saturday night with a group of friends and had a pretty good time. It's a small but intimate space. This particular night they had a $5 cover charge and a live jazzy/blues rockabilly type band. It was a really good vibe, not too loud... The drinks can be a little bit pricey but if you're really nice the bar staff will usually agree to bring them down to a 1 ounce and save you a couple bux. It's a fairly Queen West \"indy\" crowd but respectful. I'd go back there"}
{"text":"Was on the patio for most of my visit. The Patio is quite dark but no music so quite good for chatting. Waitress was quick to ask if my double rum and coke order should be in a tall glass. Quite impressive as no one ever asks me this before I actually request it. Good atmosphere. Another great location on Ossington."}
{"text":"I spent one hazy evening here last summer, drinking the most amazing margaritas (traditional lime with top notch tequila). When we needed a change we moved on to delerium tremens on tap, a rare delight. We ate some nibblies from the tapas menu, all of which were excellent enough to make up for prices (a bit high for tapas). The back patio felt cozy without feeling small and dark. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, though we definitely left somewhat intoxicated, so my judgement may be slightly flawed."}
{"text":"Our destination bar when in Toronto. Excellent tequila  drinks and outdoor patio. Lots of tequilas to choose from."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks with an emphasis on tequila. Live music every night starting at 10 except for Saturdays (I learned this the hard way) and as you can tell the live bands are definitley  a draw."}
{"text":"Been here  3 times - all Saturday nights and I have concluded that tequila makes people friendly. It is so easy to strike up a conversation in this small lounge. Pauline..... the girl from Ipanema  is your go to girl - she tends the bar and is extremely helpful explaining all tequila varieties.  Great mix of  tunes and not played loud so talk all ya want. Every so often the bar gets very crowded very quickly, then it thins out just as quick, then crowded again....so pay attention when it thins out or you will wait awhile to get a drink. The backyard patio has no bar service and was packed last Saturday.......that explains the wave of people ....coming in and out to buy their drinks."}
{"text":"Place all orders (drinks AND food) at the bar?!  They also had never heard of the 50% off your first tapas order promotion, and then applied it incorrectly so that we didn't receive the full promotion.  Our friend ordered chicken tacos and received pork. Another ordered no cilantro and received cilantro. The appetizers arrived 20 Minutes after all the tapas arrived. The food itself was decent at best and no longer hot when it arrived.   Not impressed."}
{"text":"Pretty friendly gang, found the hidden room next door for the Jay's game called El Norte. Sandy and Catherine were great hosts , loved the free hotdogs lol Drink specials were appreciated!"}
{"text":"Great little tequila bar in the heart of the new ossington strip. This place was one of the original places on the street. The atmosphere is great, set by both a good staff and owners, as well as the decor. They have a good patio at the back which is nice on a summer day."}
{"text":"Managed to snag a table on the patio to enjoy some drinks. Love the tequila and beer selection."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the hype is around Reposado. We got the Plata Martini and the Hot Ruby. The Plata Martini was lame. When I was checking in on yelp, I saw the 50% off on the tapas advertised on the yelp page. When I asked the server about it, he responded saying he knows nothing about it and isn't a yelp user. He said he would check and get back but never returned. The empanadas arrived and we were charged full price for them. The whole experience just left a bad taste."}
{"text":"GENERAL INFO Reposado is a great little tequila bar comprised of a narrow room leading into a great little patio. The bar is filled with a plethora of different tequilas, from the economical brands to the well priced higher labels. Blessed with a great staff that cares about tequila, this sophisticated lounge is the perfect place to try to convince someone you're not what you are. Just in case what you're not is a tequila drinker, feel free to look out of place with a non tequila beverage - they do offer them there.  MENU RECOMMENDATIONS I'd suggest talking to the bartender. A flight is always a great call - this is basically a tequila sampler. See Kat's review for the more detailed description. Whatever you do, don't order a shot of Cuervo.  LOCATION NOTES On the East side of Ossington, just South of Dundas.  SERVICE NOTES The staff seem to more accurately be described as tequila ambassadors than servers. At least our server did. A great knowledge of tequila and a wonderful understanding of tequila novices. Let's put it this way, not only did we order a few rounds, I went out the next day and bought a bottle of nice tequila - armed with the knowledge of what makes a good tequila and a new found love for it.  HUMOUROUS STORY I went to write about Reposado and found out Kat had already written the perfect review."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Dropped in during a little ossington crawl, I'll be the first to admit it was a little later in the evening and things were getting a bit foggy; figuratively, perhaps also literally.   Long bar, live jazz band, and pleasantly surprised to hear some Sinatra between takes.   A couple tequila shots, few pints of innis & gunn, the place was packed. Great spot for my night-cap, maybe next time I'll get there a bit earlier.   Good vibe, great service, for sure would venture back."}
{"text":"This was Stop # 3 on my Thursday Night Lady Crawl, and my second visit in the last month.  Reposado is a bit small, but it's niiiiiice. If you want drinks made with tequila and done right, try this place. It was the right amount of busy for a Thursday night.  Unlike the last time I visited, they had a jazz band playing as we walked in, which I think added to the cool ambiance. The music was bit loud, but only as you sat closer to the front.   The back patio isn't bad, either. We didn't get seats - opting to stand - but that wasn't an issue. And when we went inside to sit, we found seats.  I had one of the lime cocktails - tart (for me), but tasty. I also know they have sipping tequilas, which is a refreshing difference from the bars that serve the shot-glass-with-salt-and-lemon variety.  My experience so far hasn't been anything except positive, so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's hilarious that so many of the reviews for this place are derived from blurred recollections. But I can see why considering the extensive list of tequilas.   Back garden patio seems like it would be great in the summer! I wandered through and found a guy hiding from his friends as he was so drunk, he couldn't break his gaze from his shoelaces.   Great jazz for a trendy lounge although the sets were short and breaks were long. The intermission music was a buzzkill.   Will compliment the bartenders. Through the lines and mass of people, we never felt ignored or neglected. They somehow managed to be attentive to everyone."}
{"text":"I was here in the early evening on a hot summer day for a paloma..or two...or three..or four. We sat on the patio and I remember the chairs and tables being cute. We had tapas, I think mini empanada flight and chorizo with feta cheese tapenade and cheese plate. Our hostess was beautiful and attentive. I returned on another occasion  by myself to sip tequila and the bartender was very kind and almost educational!"}
{"text":"While this bar has the appearance of one of the more upscale, pricey stops on Ossington, it can be the centre of a totally affordable night out. Focusing on great tequila, the bar is staffed by a very friendly a knowledgeable bunch of bartenders, serves great snacks, and, most importantly, has a great selection of cheaply priced beers on tap and in bottle, including Delirium Tremens, easily the best on-tap beer in the city.   Now, be warned, the tequila is pricey (great entries on the list going for around 13-16$ a shot) but remember, these are sometimes 250-300$ bottles in the store, and you are unlikely to have the opportunity to try great tequila for a better price elsewhere. These tequilas come served in beautiful shotglasses designed to accentuate their unique aromas, and are really worth checking out, especially if you have never had a really great tequila: these are miles and miles from what you remember puking up in undergrad. For a good introduction I really recommend asking your bartender for a recommendation, I felt I knew what I was talking about with Tequila, but decided to ask for recommendations anyways, and so far everything I was pointed towards has been better than what I would have picked myself.   So, please, if you want a fun evening out for a cheap price, go to Reposado, grab one round of expensive tequilas for the experience, and then spend the rest of your evening ordering cheap beers. It'll round out to be an average costing night out, I promise, and more importantly, the bar could do with an influx of the economically challenged, my only real complaint being that sometimes I feel the bar should have been renamed Añejo in honor of the average customer."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey, but it has a wicked tequila selection.  I loved the small local feel, and it had a real nice dark ambiance.  The night we went,  there was a great band that jammed well into the morning.  That being said, it was a pretty loud place while the band was playing.  There was also a decent selection of beer if tequila isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, great for friends to get together. Variety of tapas, good for sharing with. I would recommend this place to groups of friends or date nights."}
{"text":"I went there recently on a Saturday night with a group of friends. It's a quaint little place with a great band. They serve tapas only but the portion sizes are great. We ordered the crab cakes, empanadas, cheese plate and chorizo sausage and enjoyed all 4. For the portion sizes, Reposado's prices are great. My only complaint was that the bad was a bit too loud. The amps were turned up too high that it made it difficult to carry out a conversation. Nonetheless, I enjoyed going there and will go back again."}
{"text":"This was a pretty awful experience. The serving situation was, well, let's say odd.  We arrived on a beautiful Sunday holiday weekend evening and took a seat on the much revered patio, seeing no host person in sight. We soon saw the server cleaning up the table next to us, but were ignored; we still waited a good five minutes for him to greet us (there we four parties on the patio) in case he was busy. Well, eventually we have up and my husband ordered at the bar. A newly arrived couple next to us apparently experienced the same confusion, as they asked my husband for a menu when he returned with our drinks, having mistaken my husband for a server.    The patio itself was drab, with unlit candles on the tables, and an enclosed wood fence on either side. The only redeeming quality was that you could hear the band from inside, who was quite good.    I ordered the Grand Margarita, which tasted watered down, and lacked any salt on the rim or lime on the side, which I would expect to be standard for a 12 dollar authentic margarita. The night continued to head downhill, as the couple next to us started smoking like it was the last day on earth, as well as the couple behind us, as well as the wait staff lining the walls and smoking on their break. As one might predict, the air soon became unbreathable in this small mostly enclosed space. We booked it outta there once we couldn't hold in the cough any longer.... My lungs may never forgive me.   I really wanted to like this place based on many local recommendations, but after this disaster of an experience, how could I?"}
{"text":"Great tequila bar if you're a fan (not so much me but my friend is). Cute little place with patio for those awesome summer days!  Came by on Friday with a few friends and was seated right away. They ordered two 1.5 oz of tequila (~20-30 each) and I stuck with my old fashioned and slowly sipped away while we wait for our 4th guest. Soon after, we ordered some tapas, enchiladas (I think?), crab cakes, cheese platter, chorizo platter and they also gave up a salsa and chip on the house. Food is great, service is great and atmosphere is definitely there.  Would totally come back in the future!"}
{"text":"I have been meeting people at Reposado since Ossington was still sketch! The narrow space is best on a late spring afternoon when you can order an appetizer and get some variety of Tequila on the back terrace. If it is mid-winter, there may be a cover charge to pay the band in front. I like the band, they are good, but they take up so much of the seating, the place gets packed and sweaty and there is no place for your coat. Tequila in the winter, though, is warming and reminds you of those past Mexican holidays. So, maybe a Thursday night in December? Ahhhh- a flight of tequila allows you to taste the dramatic difference.  If you have only had Cuervo, forget everything you know about Tequila.  If you have tried/love Patron, start from there and expand your horizons.  Reposado is a place to take visiting scholars of alcohol to show them Toronto rocks!"}
{"text":"This bar is all over the place. First, the drinks are ok. But, for a place that is ostensibly a tequila bar, the staff lack knowledge. I asked for the smokiest mezcal, and was first pointed to a mezcal that definitely leans sweet, not smoky. The tapas platter was fine, but pretty much everything tasted bought (rather than prepared in-house). The waitress messed up our check 3 times. That said, the back patio is lovely and a great place to pass a couple of hours, and was kid-friendly. So, if you just want a place to park for a little while, do it. If you want great Mexican food or drink, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was expecting more innovation from the cocktail menu. Mezcal is the \"in\" thing right now, yet on a fairly long list of tequila cocktails, there were only a couple of mezcal drinks on the menu, and several of those used fruity infusions of mezcal. It just seemed like a dated menu from five years ago, but out of step -- for a tequila bar -- now. Also, I think if you're going to go deep and focus on one spirit, you should design the menu in a way that guides the customer. Aside from a brief explanation of \"reposado,\" \"anejo,\" etc., the tequila (and mezcal) list is a daunting laundry list with no categorization, no descriptions of characteristics, no way for a novice to choose other than an arbitrary selection based on price point. The space and location are good (but OMG, it's too dark. We were literally using phones to read the menu. I like dark bars, but c'mon!), and our service was great. But you need to update and hone the menu and cocktail program."}
{"text":"Petit bar de quartier, le Reposado est réservé aux amateurs de tequila, la carte est tout simplement immense et vous pouvez commander vos shots à l'unité ou bien par series de 5 pour une séance de dégustation.  // Little bar located on Dundas and Ossington, the Reposado is specialised in tequilas. The selection is simply impressive, you can order your shots one by one or by series of 5 to discover the different types of flavor."}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome Mezcal selection and great cocktails. Service was attentive and helpful to make a selection. Great decor and patio out back. Love the Duggan's IPA on tap as well!"}
{"text":"Cute tapas bar with a great selection of tequilas and mezcal. We went on a Friday night and luckily snagged a seat at the bar. After 10pm, they had a live music (jazz). Loved the vibe! The place is tiny but it's so much fun!"}
{"text":"I dig this place. I'd heard and read a lot about their Mexican eats and tequila forward cocktails, but I never had the opportunity to give them a try until recently when I was there for a corporate event taking over the entire venue.  As you might imagine, being on Ossington, it's not a big space but this little diamond in the rough shines as one of the brightest spots along the strip. A long bar inside with plenty of seating, a fair number of tables and now that warmer temperatures are there a nice covered back patio behind the restaurant. Yay!  Most of us were standing around as a variety of menu item faves were passed around by servers. The tacos were fantastic in my opinion, simple in their composition but hearty and generous in portion size.   I had a few bites, enough to entice me to return soon, but the fire was lit under my ass by their cocktails! Such perfect execution and totally willing to make adjustments to taste. I asked for a Mezcal Mule, something that was off menu and they were quickly able to pivot and make something exactly to my liking!  Can't wait to come back for a proper meal and add that final star!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Small but lovely backyard patio, $10 cover on Friday nights but they have (at least on the night I was there) live jazz! All cocktails are made with freshly squeezed juice, and you can taste the difference. Their tequila flights are quite fun, and I would love to know how they make their sangrita. Delish.   Great date spot! (If your date can handle tequila, and really, would you be on a date with someone who couldn't?)"}
{"text":"When it comes to tequila, the staff at Reposados know their stuff. We headed to Reposados on a cold February Monday night. The crowd was light so we decided to sit right at the bar to have a good view of what they had on the shelf.  There were so many choices! I was like a kid in a candy store.   Right away our awesome bartender Jason suggested Clase Azul Reposado. A mid-price range tequila from the Arandas region of Jalisco Mexico. Not only was this one of the best tequila I've ever tasted but it comes in a beautiful tall Talavera bottle. This tequila is aged in old Bourbon, Cognac and Sherry casks, which give it a very smooth and complex flavour.  After the Clase Azul, I was ready to get my taste buds to work. We moved on to the broader Mescal category (Monday night Mescal special!). Jason suggested the Jaral de Barrio. Again, he was right on the money with this suggestion. It's served with a sangrita chaser (tomato juice with chopped jalapeño and a pinch of salt), which helps bring out the earthy flavour of the Jaral. Since Mescal's can bit a little hit or miss, I was glad we got to enjoy a really good one.  Sipping on these delicious tequilas, the night started to zip by. My friend tried their tequila infused pineapple drink. You definitely have to watch out for that one. Although it doesn't taste like anything but pineapple juice, it's still a good 38% alcohol content!  I finished the night with a pint of tasty Delirium (on tap!).  Because we went on a Monday night, they just had some tunes playing in the background, but on weekends, they also have their own local jazz quartet called the Reposadists, which are apparently very good."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to venture to on a Friday night. The music is top notch and the tequila is at its best in this bar.  I was there on Friday night and took advantage of the patio out back where you have the chance to star gaze (when it isn't smoggy!) and enjoy a beverage in a very well decorated atmosphere.  They have started recently implementing $5 cover at the door for the band but I promise you they will not disappoint. They are all very talented musicians.   The space is a bit of a tight squeeze but isn't that always a great opportunity to meet new people that way!   Be prepared to pay for quality Tequila and amazing Delirium Beers but when you head to a place like Reposado, you can't expect anything but the best.  This place truly is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Popped into Resposado on a Thursday night for a drink and a chat.  It's no secret that I have an affection for the beloved Margarita, so i gave it a whirl. Marvelous, simply MAHvelous. Although... it was lacking the salt rim, i forgive you. We wanted to sit on the patio but it's tiny and was plenty full, so we grabbed a little table by the bar. The jazzy band started up and my toe never stopped tappin'.  I like this place."}
{"text":"Varying iterations of Mexican screwdrivers in tubular glasses with skinny straws and you drink them really fast on the back patio that resembles someone's back yard with cutesy twinkling lights and wooden picnic tables and everyone's smoking because they still can, and then a white Louis Armstrong summons you back into the small yet cozy bar with his smooth big band crooning reminiscent of your parents' dinner-making music and you know all the words and your head hurts a lot the next day."}
{"text":"had some late afternoon drinks here with a small group. They have a fantastic patio out back. It's a perfect environment for their huge selection of tequilas and tequila cocktails. If you're looking for something to do on a late-summer afternoon, head there."}
{"text":"Ossington. This area of Ossignton used to ring true to the ear  when someone mentioned depressing, dilapidated buildings along with the generally low-price point of the nearby residential properties. Yes, that used to be quite true although still better than living on Duffering,  {insert  ba-da-bing here}! But thanks to the Jedi mind trick power of Gentrification that is no longer the case.   This area has been re-energized with clubs, art galleries, pizzeria (I am looking at you Libretto), and sprinkled with fun looking if tiny places along the strip.   Reposado is one of those places. It is fairly nondescript from the outside, although inside it has a modern cantina look with wood accents everywhere. With 'meh' tables servicing parties of four on the right and a bar with stools to the left. An exposed brick wall on the right with a few art pieces doing their best to cheer up the joint.   Now like Insomnia Lounge, Reposado suffers from the same cold, almost unfriendly cave-vibe during the day, I am certain it's the brick walls that does it.   As the decour only comes alive at night once the light are dimmed and the tea candles are put at strategic places to add that too cool for school, that borders on the romanctic. Although, all in all, it's all fairly conventional.   Aside their Tequila selection, which, are you ready for it? 78 different types of Tequila! Ay que rico! Highlights include live jazz on almost every Thursday, which I have never attended so I can't speak for and their cool if small patio at the back.   The small patio looks as it if were the tiny, low-rent brother of the back patio at Carens Wine & Cheese Bar in Yorkville. Which is not a bad thing, it is still welcoming and nice. Just low-rent.  I like this place, although I am biased as I love Tequila -- as a side note , I recently acquired two very nice specimens, a Baluarte Reposado and a Mezcal  Edición Limitada, which are just seating next to my wine rack, just waiting for a special occasion, so I am going easy on this place.   Just remember, with such a niche in a city located 4000km away from Jalisco, Mexico plus an ongoing diseases hitting Blue Agave production for the last two decades, a night experimenting at a Tequila Bar in Toronto is not going to be inexpensive.   However I am sure that if you visit with good friends and enjoy tequila, then you will have a great time at this small place."}
{"text":"I have never had a great paloma north of Mexico.  I wish I had time/liver space to try even more tequilas and other drinks.  The bar was hopping and I definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"I have to be honest it could have been a full moon..but I sort of hated this place.. our drinks.. all of them were bitter.. like draino bitter.. and of the four of us..all of thought the same thing..and they were expensive.. plus a homeless lady busted in the front door in a very crazy moment..grabbing the food/chips from a gal at the table in front of us before the staff could get her back outside- but it was a bit of a daunting..well it was just a bit wacky.. but our drinks sucked and when the four of us pointed out that we didn't like them our server told us to suck it up.. I mean we only had a sip at that point and she was like..hey that is how they are supposed to taste! anyway we split and went to the next bar and spent the rest of the night there.. much better.. I would not go back to Reposado.. and weirdly they didn't even bother to replace any of the food that was tossed in the homeless struggle!!"}
{"text":"Nice, cozy bar. Decent selection of drinks. Authentic tacos, two of them are vegan while one is vegetarian that can be veganized upon request. All delicious. Check-in offer was rejected so I didn't order tapas.  After a while a live band showed up and started playing classic music, a bit loud for such cozy place but overall I was impressed by the performance. Overall it was a great night."}
{"text":"Tequila! Not the type of bar you want to do a suicide shot in...and by that I mean you are not going to be surrounded by a lot of young people shooting cheap tequila, snorting the salt and squeezing the lemon juice in their eyes.   I really like Reposado, it is often my go to place if I am venturing down the Ossington Strip. I love the good quality tequila they serve here, in fact this place introduced me to the fact that I actually quite like tequila. All those years proclaiming what a foul drink this was were wasted! Then again nothing like a cheap and nasty version of anything to put you off.   It is not the cheapest place to drink, but the drinks are quality. The ambiance of the place is relaxed and welcoming, which is why it can get very busy. I have been here when there has been live music on, really good fun but not the right volume if you are looking to have a quiet chat with someone.   The food here is limited but good, crab cakes were really nice.   Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"I dislike Tequila. It's not my drink of choice and I wouldn't ever order it on my own free will. It seems to also be my birthday curse, but that's a story everyone can relate to.  Although this is true, I like Reposado. I like their drinks, the people and what it stands for. They use the good stuff here and they mix your drinks well. The tequila selection is large and the mixes seem endless, they'll do it all. They make tequila cocktails right and they are delicious, even to a tequila hater like myself.  The space is cozy, just a bar and a narrow strip to get in and out. However, they do have a fantastic patio out back. Bean stalks grow on the fences and if you're lucky, you can munch on them while sipping on your delicious and unique concoction.   Overall, Reposado is a nice intimate place to meet new people or to relax with friends. The drinks are good, pricey but taste like quality. Reposado represents that small quaint place that makes you feel comfortable once you walk in. It has everything to offer. Just take it all in and sip steady."}
{"text":"Good cockatils and great small bites! We loved emposado and margaritas.  It was slow night or we were too early- around 7:30pm but we loved it! Great and fun date night at the bar!  Bartender was great!"}
{"text":"One obligated stop while partying on Ossington.   If you go with a big group, you'll probably need to segregate, the premises are tight, plus it gets really busy... On the other hand, this place is successfully intimate for couples (iiiiuuu), specially if you take into consideration the low lights, the sexy live music (some days), and the \"makes everybody attractive\" magic potion called tequila.  If I were a guy I would bring first dates here.  The bar pampers the eyes, what a beautiful image: all kind of tequilas and mezcales illuminated by a purple mystic light...  The musicians were delightful, I felted like dancing, and for an instant they transported me to the 1920's. Those $5 bucks for cover were worth.   After having a huge dinner, the \"Hola café\" seemed like my best bet, boy it worked...! (excellent digestive)  We couldn't leave without refreshing our tongues with one of their heavenly fixed Palomas (a must taste).  Salud!"}
{"text":"Think tequila and you'd probably think of a rather messy scene. If you want to yell WOOOOOOOOO and pound back tequila shots...this isn't the place for you. At least it isn't if you go like I did on the oh-so-happening Sunday night.  Highly enjoyed the Tequila Avión flight sampler. The blanco was paired with surprisingly delicious shot of this spicy sauce. The reposado was enjoyed plain. The anejo was paired with dark chocolate.  Great place to kick back and relax and fine tune your tequila appreciation, especially in the outdoor garden in the back.  Oh and, interesting fact of the day: I asked about the sign, and it's a bat skeleton to pay homage to the bats that pollinate the agave plants."}
{"text":"meh. cool vibe. nice atmosphere. as far as the drinks themselves.. nothing amazing. very average tequila and selection...bartenders didnt give a care about selling anything or even elaborating. i had to twist the guys arm to even pay attention for a minute and recommend something. instead of being excited about any cocktails he just pointed out the most popular thing and didnt care to do much else."}
{"text":"Precisely what it ought to be. If you have friends who think they don't like tequila or, perhaps worse, friends who like terrible tequila because they don't know any better, this is the place. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable, the selection is unparalleled in the city. I hear their mixed drinks leave something to be desired but I haven't tried em myself - stick to the tequila straight and you'll do fine.  If you're new to tequila, and maybe wary because all the tequila you've tried has tasted like fire and paint thinner, Reposado is a really great place to fix that, because they do it right. Ask the bartender for something gentle and \"silver\" (clear, hasn't been sitting in barrels for years) just to get the flavour figured out. Tequila has a lovely fruity flavour but a lot of people dive in to the añejo (aged) stuff which is golden from the oak, and can taste almost more like whiskey than fruit. Aging does all kinds of wonderful things to the flavour, don't get me wrong, but starting with the silver stuff helps you understand where it comes from. Then you can move through the aging process, they can even assemble you a tasting flight that takes a single tequila through its ages. Very educationadrunk.  Strangely, I've never been here when they've had live music going, but it ought to be a great place for it - cozy, good booze, nice vibe."}
{"text":"i really liked this place.. tequila bar!! how awesome!! i like how little this place is and their cocktails are killer!!! i had one that was tequila infused with strawberry, jalapeno and pink grapefruit juice.. was soooooooo gooooooood..!!! yummo!!!  would be going back very soon i hope!!"}
{"text":"Solid tequila cocktails that aren't sweetened with nasty bar juice - just pure freshly squeezed fruits and agave. Nice little back patio and delicious snacks including guacamole and various tacos. The inside part of the bar is not the most unique or pleasant spot to be in (long and narrow, little light) but the back patio is covered (for rainy days) and is full of greenery. Good summer hangout spot (especially if the line at Bellwoods Brewery is too long)!"}
{"text":"Reposado gave me an exciting night out!  I came here a couple Fridays ago and enjoyed some of their delicious margaritas.  It was pretty busy, so we didn't get to enjoy the patio, but it looked great when we walked around.  Instead, we found a table inside, which wasn't all that comfortable.  Tables were sticky and ventilation left something too be desired.  The kicker for me was when the bouncer instigated a fight with one of the patrons.    What's the lesson?  Come for the drinks, get onto the patio and beware of the bouncers"}
{"text":"Reposado is a little but well known Tequila bar on the Ossington strip. I went here on a Friday night, it was busy but still lots of room to stand around. I tried a mango margarita, they are not shy with the booze!   We sauntered to the back patio and managed to snag enough free chairs for my group. People were stingy giving up their un-used chairs! 'Oh my friend is coming and I need these 5 empty chairs' um ok.  My wonderful elite friends (shout out to Denise and Leslie) and I shared a tasting of tequilas. The blanco was my favourite!   There was a live jazz band playing. They were pretty good (I'm not really qualified to review a jazz band so lets leave it at that ;).   I like Reposado. Its a good date place. Or just to hang out with your peeps. We paid $5 cover on Friday, but I heard that is only on weekends (?)."}
{"text":"Terrible/non-existent service, food was mediocre and took for freaking ever, traditionally non-meat option didn't have meat indicated on menu,on that note, no vegetarian options at all, no water or napkins provided without passive aggressive eye rolling from server. Will definitely not be coming back, what a joke."}
{"text":"Reposado is by far my favorite bar in Toronto. Great atmosphere, amazing drinks, and quality folks. Btw, more hotties here than anywhere.  I'm from San Francisco, and This place delivers."}
{"text":"Great tequila and mezcal selection, nice cocktail list (however did not salt rim my margarita ) service was great, we didn't try the food but we defiantly warmed up with the drinks"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of hard to find tequilas for Ontario. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. I live nearby, and Reposado has become the go-to spot for a drink for my husband and me. It's great in the winter with live music, and in the summer with its cozy back patio."}
{"text":"I was excited to attend Reposado for the second time... for a private open bar event through their bar room and patio.  There was a special open bar menu from which I most enjoyed their Paloma mixed drink.  It wasn't as sweet as the margarita; it was a soda based drink which could only be placed in the ranks of a mojito for its palatability... did I just make up a word?  My first visit was more typical of the bar's everyday ambiance... quiet enough to sit upon the stools at the bar and have a conversation with the bartender... it became almost like a history and tasting tour of tequila.    An absolute must try, for tequila lovers and haters alike, is the 10-year oak aged Clase Azul Reposado. I didn't know tequila could taste so good!"}
{"text":"Came here at 1AM on a Friday night and this place was still very busy. My friend and I shared a tequila flight and a resparado margarita. The tequila flight is interesting, they label the tequila and provide sangrita and dark chocolate for after taste. However, I'm not a huge fan of sipping tequila even when it's super high quality so maybe I'm not the best audience for a flight. Loved the margarita though - would definitely come here again.  Also the major plus about this place in the summer is its back patio. Super cute with lights and wooden benches!"}
{"text":"A great place if you are feeling the urge to splurge on some quality tequilas.  It has a great selection of tequilas and offers unique twists of classics such as grapefruit margueritas and straight tequila liqueurs.  Ideal for smaller groups since the place is a narrow sliver, however the patio in the back gives it a more \"open\" feel.  Also not the cheapest place so if you plan on partying hard, do some pre-drinking or move on elsewhere to finish the night."}
{"text":"Reposado is a lovely small place to meet up with a friend and grab beer/tapas. I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3-4 and it wasn't packed at all. The patio was full but we could have grabbed a seat beside someone.  This place is a little on the jazzy, sophisticated maybe even pretentious side for me...It's also not that cheap, so I don't think I would come here again but I see the appeal for the general population.  Patio is lovely, cozy and comfortable and quiet enough for an intimate conversation.  Inside is narrow and dark, the bar is littered with overprices bottles of tequila and various alcohols I would never try. I got a beer and we ordered tapas.  Food: Small plantes - obviously Chorizo with some kind of dip...good! Nothing special though, just tastes like regular sausage. Homemade potato chips and dip - A LOT of chips and the dip was sour cream based (i think), very good I was impressed. Be careful with the chips, they're harder than regular chips and you MAY be an idiot like your truly and cut a gum or two. Picante crab cakes - yum! spicy, definitely recommend.  Empanadas - spicy, very good - there were 4 in an order I think.  All in all, the tapas were a good addition to the beer and we didnt walk away hungry. PS does anyone order beer in this joint? Seriously. I just want a damn pint, i don't like stupid martinis!!!!  THERE IS SO MUCH TEQUILA. Jesus christ... I didn't know tequila could exist in such quantities and cost this much money. Buy at your own risk, this sh*t is for serious people."}
{"text":"Reposado is a great place to kick back and enjoy some quality jazz and top-notch tequila and margaritas.  This bar gives off the vibe of being down to earth, yet endlessly cool.  My friend's dad is the owner and can be usually seen at the front of the place, singing your (or at least my) favourite jazz tunes with the in-house band, The Reposadoists!  If they're not on, then Piper's Laptop will be playing (which is quite literally my friend Piper's laptop, expect she's in Europe right now.)  The place is small and long, so can get cramped pretty easily, but there's a cozy patio in the back, that has low tables and chairs, and a tiki bar where you can chill as you patiently wait for an open seat.  Whoever designed the inside definitely has good taste in my opinion, with large, beautiful and unique photographic prints on the exposed brick walls.  I'm not going to comment too much on the margaritas, as I'm definitely not a tequila aficionado, but I DO suggest the blood-orange margarita.  I dig the vibe of the place and only wish I went there more often.  Perks:  During my first visit, this past Valentine's Day, my friend's mom came around to every table distributing Hershey's Kisses to everyone.  I also met Stefan Brogren.  All you early 90s kids know who I'm talking about.  That's right, \"Snake\" from Degrassi.  Amazing, I know.  Other Toronto based actors and indie musicians can be seen here regularly.  So what are you waiting for?  Get over to Ossington, order yourself a margarita, request an Ella Fitzgerald song and wink at the cute bartender for me.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Perfect experience. A million thanks to Jan and Jason for being charming barkeeps, ideal DJs, tasteful mixologists, and generous tourist suggestion-givers. (If you guys see this, we didn't make it to Black Hoof, but it's top on my list for next time I'm back in town!)  The stained glass behind the bar helped earn that elusive fifth star. So did the garden in the back, the tremendous tequila selection, the fresh squeezed lemon in the sour, and the juicy, spicy chorizo dish (charcuterie supplied by El Gaucho down the street, Jason told us) with perfectly salty tapenade.  Between two of us, we indulged in: Two classic margaritas (so tart. made with hornitos. perfecto.) Agave \"Manhattan,\" made with tequila, galliano, and sweet vermouth, garnished with a twist. (As a bourbon drinker, I was on the fence for this unlikely recipe, but I admit that it was tasty.) \"La Vida Buena,\" with tequila, fresh grapefruit, and agave nectar. This might have been my fave. Blood orange margarita. Fresh juice, tart. Strawberry margarita. Fresh strawberry puree. very similar to original."}
{"text":"I think for most people Tequila brings back memories of shitty Jose Cuervo and having your head in the toliet.   Reposado helps to mellow those cringe-worthy memories. This place is really great!   There is a extensive list of tequila complete with sampling flights (if you can afford them, they are a bit pricey).  The mixed drinks are fantastic. The classic margarita is delicious and comes in an eligent long thin glass with rocks in. After about the fourth Marg my mouth got a bit sore from all of the sourness, but they had a great selection of a few awesome microbrewery beers. They have some variations of the classic Margarita using blood orange juice and some other equally delicious and refreshing combinations. You can taste the tequila but it is not over powering on your palate and goes down smooothly.      I've been here a handfull of the times and always seem to find a place on the patio which is filled with a friendly but cool crowd. There is a small amout of tables and chairs and also calf-hight little teak benches. Very nice greenery and little torch lights give it a great ambiance considering its a concrete patio. The Tiki Bar at the back is the perfect place to grab your beverage of choice when it gets a bit to crowded to the inside bar.   The staff have always been very friendly and accomidating. The food that I have had there was also a great little snack. I've had mini Empanada's there that were as good as I've had in South America. My mum and I also ordered the homemade potato chips with dip and they were also a great munching snack.   Reposado is just a bit more refined then a lot of the bars on Ossington without a snooty attitude. A great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Great vibe and patio. The jazz music is cool. Not enough servers and had to wait ah hour at the bar for a head nod from the bartender. The place has so much potential. Won't be back. I don't wait 1hr for a drink."}
{"text":"Now this place is just cool.  I'm sure the good press helps, but this place was righteously packed as the night continued on.  Acting like old people, our little group settled down at the table in the front window and ordered pour, after pour, after pour, of the most reasonably priced tequila I've come across to date.  Tequila is correctly served with sangrita and lime, though there is a nominal charge for their delicious sangrita.  It's just spicy enough, with enough fruity flavor to accent the tomato.  Strangely enough we did get a recommendation from the bartender who said that this brand new tequila was awesome, but she was pregnant.  I'm sure she didn't taste it while with child.  Just goes to show you that the bartenders know their stuff.  All the tequila we tried went down nicely.  5 stars.  This is a solid tequila bar, with a great list.  This is the place to come to enjoy real tequila.  They have a small patio out back, but that crowds quickly."}
{"text":"Great spot with a good vibe and good looking people.  I like it here."}
{"text":"I wanted to have a good first tequila experience and was brought here by someone who claimed this place had the best grades of tequilas. I started off the night with a tall glass of long island iced tea, which was (two thumbs up) fantastic. My guest then proceeded to order a shot of patron silver for both of us and I was a bit disappointed that they did not offer me a lemon. Down the hatch! I took the shot like a champ (with no lemon) and it went down so smoothly and brought on a warming after-effect.  I loved the aesthetics and ambience of the bar, I would say it takes on a mixture of rustic and hipster vibes. I definitely enjoyed my experience here and would recommend any tequila lovers/connoisseurs to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten here, so I can't comment on that, but the drinks are worth the visit alone. I love me some good tequila, or resposado, if you will, and this place serves it up in delicious varieties and concoctions. The blood orange and grapefruit margaritas are standouts.   If you're waiting for a table at one of the many restos on Ossington that do not take reservations, bide your time here."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, the live music, lack of a cover on a Thursday night with said live music, the (cute) bartender, the lighting, the location-- its all there. Unfortunately the few drinks i had, although clearly girly and could arguably be their weakest drinks, the blood orange margarita, mango margarita, and their cosmolita, weren't great. Pretty sour to be honest-- but I appreciated what they were trying to do. How often can one get a blood orange margarita? I think next time I will stick with straight up shots. :)"}
{"text":"This place makes me really happy.  Kinda random and pretty delish.  I am a sucker for live bands, a mishmash of people, and tequila margaritas.  I have a feeling, they will be seeing alot of me! =D"}
{"text":"Tequila and I have had a long love affair.  Ever since I lived in Mexico, I've had a soft spot for delicious Mezcal and Tequila. I don't know how it took me so long to actually go here, but it was a really lovely atmosphere, with a great jazz band that played and REAL Mexican SANGRITA!! Ayyyy Dios mio! There were even tiny chunks of jalapeno in the sangrita - I wept a little. Maybe from the heat, maybe from joy. Either way, it was a great time.  i was a little surprised to see that the chips and dip were quite literally chips with dip, but I think that speaks to the pull-no-punches quality of Reposado's menu and also my starry, tequila filled eyes.  i will be back. Oh jess, I will!"}
{"text":"Go for the drinks, don't eat the food! What i had was overpriced and burnt. Chill place to have a drink, There was a cute little band playing. The heated patio is amazing!"}
{"text":"Reposado is hands-down my most favourite place to spend an evening in Toronto.  I am completely besotted with this bar, and I didnt even start out as one who enjoyed tequila - though I can very easily attribute that to the sauza gnar I'd once thought was the real deal.  I almost don't want to give them 5-stars just because I want this place all to myself.    Anyways, let's continue on.  Whilst Reposado does have a small Tapas menu, this place is all about the drinks.  Haven't really experimented much with their draught but they do have a really delicious Belgian brew named after alcohol withdrawal symptoms: Delereium Tremens.  Don't let the name put you off, I'm glad I took a chance with this one.  It's malty with significant hopps, and ask if its a fresh keg 'cause I find it tastes way better when nice and carbonated.  My girlfriend and I had a bunch of tequila cocktails ranging from tequila + soda + bitters to one that featured a nice tequila with blood orange and lime.  It's hard to remember them all but I can assure you that we were very happy with all of them, especially the Tri Fecta, which features a small goblet of fine tequila paired with a Dos Equis Lager and a shot of this super concentrated tomato puree which was spicy and very salty but so intense and delicious I had to ask for another shot of it.    Reposado is small and narrow, so go here early on a weekday to avoid the crowds and enjoy some great gypsy jazz by the in-house band, appropriately named the Reposados."}
{"text":"Reposado really is one of the biggest gems of the Ossington strip.  They have a really cool list of cocktails. I had the \"Hot Ruby\", which was stawberry infused tequila, habanero infused tequila, and grapefruit soda. Totally a standout - I'd reccomend it if you're looking for something a little different! The sweetness of the strawberry with the heat of the habanero is really neat.  If you're looking to try out some of the different tequilas, try one of the flights that allows you to sample a few!  The servers here are really knowledgeable, so if you have any questions feel free to ask them!   The live music is really, really good. It was sort of a latin-inspired jazz. Love love love it. Though I reccomend sitting closer to the back, and not towards the door where the band is set up, and it can get a wee bit loud :).  We tried a couple of the tapas (take advantage of the Yelp check-in offer! 50% off of your first tapas plate!)  Chips & Dip - the dip was awesome but chips tasted like something you can get out of a bag Chorizo with an olive tapanade. A-Okay. Nothing else to really add to that comment :P.  They were okay, but really, you're not coming here to eat, you're coming here for some good tequila and good music! :)  Will most certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"And so, I join the masses of yelp colleagues in writing a review of this fantastical tequila bar on the Ossington strip.   I've been a handful of times over the past 8 or 9 months or so (and yes, I only discovered this lovely place 8 or 9 months ago!), but every time has been a thoroughly enjoyable evening!  More often with a reasonable sized group of friends (consistently 5+) though I have been on more intimate one-on-ones (ie, dates) as well.    I will admit, the first time this place was brought up, I was skeptical.  I've been physically against tequila since I was about 22, after a rather unsightly incident involving a hotel pool in Cancun, a frightening number of tequila shots, and severe \"food poisoning\" for the remainder of the day...and night...and into the next day.  ANYways.   With the requisite amount of trepidation one would expect after having a seriously negative experience with tequila, I went to the tequila bar.  And, oh my, what an excellent decision it was!    First, the atmosphere: oh my stars, gorgeous!!  Woody and romantic.  Mauricio may be right, as I've never seen it during the day, but it for certain looks lovely at night.  The back bar is gorgeous, massive chapel style mirrors reflecting back some of the most interestingly shaped bottles I've ever seen!  The feeling? Relaxed and casual, despite my feeling like I should be dressed up a little more than some of the other establishments around here.  Live music tends to make itself heard here, and is often a of a jazzey feel.  Finally, I can actually hear my drinking companion(s), which is kind of important when one's on a first date.  I feel like a grown up drinking here.   Second, and likely more important, the drinks: for a tequila-disliker (\"hater\" seemed such a strong sentiment), I was pleasantly and pleasurably surprised!  I've had a handful of the drinks on the chalkboard written menu and all were delicious.  I've made the incredible discovery that I'm in fact not a through and through tequila-disliker, just a dirty, cheap tequila disliker.  The prices are somewhat high; there are drinks under $10 and the median is $10.  They also offer a handful of flights with 3 or 4 ounces of good tequila...and a chocolate.  I may have never had a flight, but I've had some of the chocolates.   Where did the extra star go?  Well, as much as I do love the decor, it's a skinny little bar with a tiny little patio.  I've mostly had to stand around the bar or side shelf and share a single stool between 2 or 3 people.  The place becomes busy quite early on in the evening, so if you'd like a seat, go REALLY early.   Also, never having had the tapas or the wine (nor having paid for them), I'm reserving that extra star until I can comment more fully.  Really, I guess this is more of a first-draft review with room to improve."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!  Emailed to book a party of 20 people for food and drinks, birthday party (so it would have been a sizeable bill). The responses were dismissive and short - they actually initially responded with one word - 'nope'. After some back and forth it turns out they're just rude and unhelpful, and apparently can't be bothered. Interestingly enough, you can book resos via the Yelp! App so they do take them. However I won't be giving them my business - I have been to Reposado before (not bad but didn't blow me away) but they can keep their pretentiousness to themselves.  I'll take my business elsewhere. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful great first experience here.  The bartender (Kyle) was very knowledgeable and had a great tequila tasting!  Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"The last stop of a citywide bar crawl was at Reposado Bar & Lounge.  I came here for an Elite Event a couple of summers ago, liked it then and like it now! Great location; if you're jonesing to change scenes, you have other bars to choose from as Queen Street is 2 blocks away. The drink menu is quite diverse with beers and various cocktails. I had the Mango Margarita, which was delicious. The jazz band was fantastic. Reposado is overall a very chill place where you can enjoy great music and fantastic drinks.  I'm a fan !"}
{"text":"I've been to this place once. It has a really cool back patio and a nice vibe all around. Its very dark in there. Very low lights. You'll need to like that kind of ambience. There's also some pretty decent live music there on most nights. Mostly jazz.  Their specialty is tequila, but they do have some other stuff too. Their drinks are kind of on the pricier side, so I wouldn't say this is a place you'de come regularly (unless you're some kind of tequila aficionado)  Mainly a good place to go on a date I'de say."}
{"text":"I've heard horror stories of the gory wakes of destruction tequila leaves. Given that I am asian with the stereotypical horrible tolerance, I wasn't too keen on spending a night puking.  I ended up in Reposado and daringly decided to go for one of their infused tequilas, on ice. Surprisingly it was fragrant, tasty, and enjoyable. Not to mention dignified--it came in a tiny glass goblet-like invention, a mini-wine glass.  Five stars, Reposado, for giving me a wonderfully amazing first experience with tequila. I couldn't imagine a universe where I'd like it, but rejoice for such a universe exists.  (Their cocktails are really good too! ...and is it just me, or are the ice cubes actually spherical...??)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, live music, smaller narrow bar so it becomes busy quickly.. Awesome selection of tequila, and cocktails. I haven't tried the food but would recommend it as a place to stop in as you're bar hopping along Osslington"}
{"text":"totally great bar! delish drinks"}
{"text":"It's a cool place to go with a couple of friends to celebrate something. It's expensive, but the tequilas are worth the visit. What they really need is a better food menu, because you can't drink tequila and mezcal with such tiny little expensive side tapas - hangover guaranteed! I'd LOVE to taste their drinks with decent mexican food - to share!   Take your date, S.O. or just a few good fellows there to enjoy a great (and I said expensive?) night."}
{"text":"This charming nook serves some superb margaritas. That said, it gets pretty chilly in the small space with frequent entrances/exits. I'm not a tequila aficionado but this seems like the place to go for that sort of thing. Service is okay but -1 star for charging cover later on."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Their drink menu is unbelievable and the bartenders surely are talented in the drink making department. I just went here to grab a few drinks to start off the night and to catch up with a friend and this place was great to do just that!  I ordered the Blood Orange Margarita and it comes in a nice tall glass, great flavor, amazing tequila, and quite stiff. I really enjoyed it. The bartenders were really friendly, made some great suggestions, and definitely concocted some delicious drinks for us. The prices are fair, the venue is small but still comfortable. I liked the decor as well. Some of their cocktails are quite pricey, but definitely delicious so savor every sip! Their drink menu is quite extensive so there are plenty of things to choose from, especially tequila, so stop on in for a drink or two! I will most definitely return here again when I'm visiting! Salud!"}
{"text":"After not being able to find a seat at Foxley bistro, my friends and I came to Reposado as a tapas alternative within the same area.   I'm sad to say that after we arrived, settled down, ordered our drinks, and then tried to order food, we were informed that their tapas menu was not available for the night... I wish we were told this sooner, as it would have changed our decision to stay.  We settled for the tacos, sold in trios. They weren't that bad but not that fabulous either. We also ordered guacamole, and a few other unmemorable menu items to share. They were okay.   The lighting in the bar was awful. Super dark, and impossible to read our menus. There was also no seating for a group of 5 so we had to dine at the bar in the far corner.   Overall, my visit here was not enjoyable if only considering the food. I didn't order any drinks but I am guessing they were good, as they pride themselves in their selection of tequila.   On the plus side, the waitress was kind enough o split our bills 5 ways, and correctly separate our drinks, which was nice.   I'd only consider returning here for drinks, with a group of 4 or less."}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks, but it was great.  It's a tequilla bar and you really get to appreciate the full flavours of tequilla here.  For the life of me, i don't remember my drinks (yes i got nicely buzzed as i started drinking after work here) but i remember having a great variation of a spicy spicy ceaser, and a great drink with grapefruit juice in it. Those were the two that stood out.  I have to warn you though, drinks are not cheap, especially when you start getting into trying different things. But it's a good place and worth it in my opinion.   The ambience is quite nice and the patio is cool in the summer. The seating is really low and almost middle eastern like. Chilled out vibe."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Very casual and chill. Drinks were good, but not amazing. Server is very relaxed, so this could be interpreted as rude, but I think she's just nonchalant. Didn't try the food, but the empanadas in our neighbouring table looked good."}
{"text":"This place hits all the right notes with me when it comes to decor both inside and out.   Inside you are welcomed with with dim lighting, exposed brick, dark tables and chairs, black ceiling, candles, floating shelf window thing opposite the L shaped rosewood bar, and a stained glass window. Bathrooms are kept nice and tidy with white back splash, aluminum tile trim, and a hand dryer that will blow the skin off your hands.  The patio is one of my favorites in the city, despite the very low furniture. Nice wooden deck, tall wood privacy fencing, inlaid lighting on the wooden floorboards, and a tiki bar so you don't have to get up and hit the bar for more tequila.   The service here is great, even when it's busy the servers will take the time to explain whatever it is you want. The tequila's available here are much more refined than anywhere else in the city. Even if you don't want tequila they have great beers on tap like Delirium Tremens and Stratford Pilsner.   Overall, this place becomes more and more of a go to spot for a night out of drinks with friends. The prices can be steep when reaching the top shelf tequilas but that goes for any beverage of choice. Good bang for buck and the intimate setting just tops it off."}
{"text":"Neat cozy dark long bar with live music on weekends. Although the bar was long and narrow it never felt uncomfortably crowded.   They do tequila flights, a sample of 3 and some spicy tomato juice for palette cleansing. It was fun to try the different kinds, figure out which one you like and then order cocktails based on that. Friendly bartenders and hooks to hang coats/bags (a feature not to be underestimated)."}
{"text":"Always a good time here. A place where you an come to truly appreciate tequila - none of those cheap tequila you used to shoot back at the clubs. Love the small patio in the back."}
{"text":"We came to this cute bar in the Ossington on a extremely cold Saturday hoping for somewhere to have a few drinks and read on yelp that they have a live band on Saturday. We came early enough where we didn't have to line up or pay cover and also the live music didn't start yet.  They have some cute Mexican tapas and cocktails.  But since we already had dinner we opted for cocktails instead. The bar is tiny with very limited seating and a bar area. They have a outdoor patio so I can see how it would be an amazing place be be in the summertime. The live band started playing at 10pm. They played some bluesy music. I enjoyed it. All in all a cute intimate bar. Come early as it get later in the night they start to charge cover to get in. I would recommend this bar."}
{"text":"amazing drinks! habanero tequila and strawberry tequila omg i also had a cucumber tequila martini wow"}
{"text":"I have been to this place only on a Saturday night outing - but boy does it have great ambiance ! Live music, great drinks with great company - can't ask for more. The patio at the back is very charming."}
{"text":"Great place, a Mexican themed bar with a clean dark interior and a spectacular patio out back. The patio is shaded enough to be pleasant in any weather, and if it is warm out, it is as pleasant as any patio you will ever find. The menu has plenty of nice beers, but their bread and butter is tequila and mezcal. Their list is enormous. For me, I'm not going straight, so I went cocktail. Thankfully, they have some nice custom tequila/mezcal based cocktails to choose from, and the tegroni, a negroni with tequila instead of gin, was really well mixed and refreshing. Nice touch. Once the kitchen opened at 6, we also ordered a taco trio with beef. The tacos are small - just enough for a snack - but delicious. Great flavor, great corn shell, and seasoned perfectly. Nothing to complain about here, my friends."}
{"text":"Great little place in Toronto !  Bar staff was really friendly, food delicious and drinks too. The vibe was really nice too for a date night. I'd definitely go back !"}
{"text":"Great selection of tequilas.  I had their blood orange drink which went down very easy.  The decor on the patio is nice and includes a tiki bar.  I would have liked to spend more time here.  I guess I'll have to go back again"}
{"text":"Live music, good drinks and a nice patio this Reposado Bar was adventurous and cool."}
{"text":"I have not been back to Reposado Bar & Lounge since I attended an Yelp Elite Event here. All I remembered I had a really good time?   Back again with some of my fellow Yelp friends on a weeknight. The place was quiet and I remembered we were the loudest table? We talked about future bachelorette and bachelor parties that involves strip joints? I think?  I shared a Herrudura Flight ($30). Someone had an anejo Manhattan ($12.39) and told me it was good. Another person gave me his shot of Tromba Blanco  ($8.41) because it was not his thing, he enjoyed his Stratford Pilsener ($4.87) way more... And someone got really happy drinking her Virgin Sangrita ($1.33).   Reposado is definitely a great place to hang out and chill with your friends.   I need to go back again, maybe after a few shot of Tequlia, I will remember more?!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me to rate... It was hard to get a drink because the bar was so busy, but once I was able to get the bartenders' attention, it was great service. Their drinks seem complex to make, and I guess the bar gets a little backed up because of volume.  We tried a few tequila cocktails, they were good. Live band played jazzy rock. I liked it, my friends didn't. There's a heated patio in the back... I found it odd. There was a bar without a bartender back there, and heaters that didn't reach the entire space. We felt cold and went back inside.   I'm not going to give this place a low rating because I really liked the music, drinks, and vibes, despite the amount of people. Think I'll come back on a weekday."}
{"text":"It's posh as hell, but you do get what you pay for. I got a flight of Mezcal as well as a side of tortilla chips and salsa whilst waiting for my friend to get off work at 11. I met someone really cool here while looking like an old-ass drunkard with three shots of transparent Mezcal in front of me. It wasn't cheap, but it was worth it -- really, really good stuff.  This is an unusual spot for the area - most places tend to be divier. If you're expecting something that fits into the mold of the area, this isn't it. If you don't really take stock in the crowd that populates a place, but care about the quality of drinks and food served - this place may be for you.  I enjoyed the live jazz band here. Coincidentally, the girl I met here was the girlfriend of the bassist. They're both great people! Toronto is sweet."}
{"text":"My bar review are always a little, erm...fuzzy.  But, to quote a country song: it's 5 o'clock somewhere, so a bar review feels in order.  AMIRITE?!?  So, Reposado.  Great tequila, and great tequila selection.  Bar staff know their stuff,  creative cocktail options and, did I mention...GREAT tequila?    I like that it's small, and have enjoyed popping in for a drink early on a weekday evening when it's not too busy.  The back is a dreamy garden oasis, a term I use here both earnestly and seriously, despite the fact that it sounds hokey.    *moment of thought*  Hokeyness be damned!  I want to convey the image appropriately: a tequila-friendly garden oasis.  Top that, world!  Yelp note: as much as I love Reposado's drinks, their tapas are ok but nothing special.  It's fine to get a few snacks if something to line the stomach is desperately needed, but otherwise I'd stick with the liquids here."}
{"text":"I love this place! One of my favorites on Ossignton. Weekend nights around 10pm they have live music playing, typically 3 or 4 piece blues/jazz bands that really rock!  A wide selection of tequilas and a knowledgeable staff to help guide your journey of either horizontal or vertical flights (or, both!.. this has happened on several occasions and can be dangerous).  Great back patio with heaters in the cooler weather.   Seating can be tough, especially when there is live music so I recommend arriving early if you are looking to have a seat while enjoying the performance."}
{"text":"This is a great spot on Ossington for some awesome Mexican food and drinks. Their outdoor patio is fantastic. Get the mini burritos! They're bite size and delicious."}
{"text":"i love this place. i'd give more details but my memories are a bit fuzzy. oops. did i mention that i loved this place and had a really good time here? :)  it's small, can get crowded at times, the tables get full fast, they have a  small back patio. the music is good, the drinks are excellent. if you can score a table or a set at the bar, you're in for a night."}
{"text":"Strong drinks, great live music (shout out to the coolest bassist on Fridays!) Get your mezcal fix here :D"}
{"text":"First time here.   Pros: Patio was nice, nice decor, like that it had jazz music. Drinks were good.  Cons: Super crowded, drinks were over priced and due to no control of their own im sure they were short staffed.  Why one star? After my partner waited 40+min for drinks...the bartender forgot to bring back his credit card so we could settle the tab and leave..it was crazy busy I get it, however, after failing to get his attention I raised my voice so he could hear me over the noise. He then proceeded to talk down to me, accuse me of yelling at him, told me it wasn't a buger king and wouldnt listen when I tried to explain the misunderstanding. He never would have talked to a guy the way he talked down to me. Very massagonistic. I thought maybe I was over reacting about the massagony however, my partner who is male and was also present agrees with my interpretation. Shook me up. I get that it was busy and the bartenders were super stressed but this was a horrible experience. I won't be back."}
{"text":"As others have said, Reposado serves up tequila far superior to any of the crap you remember puking up in college. Instead of making a pained, sour pickle face as you down it, you feel as dignified as a diplomat while you sip a selection of premium tequilas hand-selected for you by a knowledgeable and personable staff.  Our bartender, Eddie, attended to us with such care and customization I felt like I was meeting with a mortgage consultant or wedding planner. He quizzed us on our favourite types of alcohol and price points to finally suggest the perfect flight for us to sample - Milagro brand tequila.   A flight is a series of one ounce servings of a brand of tequila (they have tons of them) in each of the three stages of tequila's lifespan - blanco (white, or virgin), reposado (\"rested\") and añejo (\"aged\"). The lot is served on a tray with Sangrita, a sort of spicy tomato shot that you can sip like a chaser in between swills of tequila. Don't be fooled by the tequila shot glasses though - this isn't the Madison and you're not meant to down these in one swallow. Sit back and enjoy as you work your way from brisk blanco to smooth añejo.   Reposado also has excellent margaritas, including classic (reposado margarita), blood orange (a house favourite) and mango. Try them all. Also be sure to try some of their excellent beers - they have Delerium Tremens and apparently, according to my beer aficionado friends, this is quite the find. Savour it!"}
{"text":"Just too a little walk down Ossington Avenue and the Dos Equis logo drew us in.  We sat at the back at the patio.  Their feature liquor is Tequila.  Lots of variety ranging from your commonly drank Tequila to your top self Tequila.  The patio was cute and chill.  I was there with family and it was a nice vibe and we are looking forward to try the tapas.  Definitely a neat place to check out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in TO.  Definitely the go to spot when I need to get my mescal fix.  The sangrita blew me away as well.   Sangrita is not easy to find, especially at Tex Mex/Mexican joints in TO and this sangrita a serious kick in the mouth!  The bartenders were incredibly friendly and well versed in the world of tequila.  Will definitely be making this a regular stop in the future."}
{"text":"One tequila, two tequila, three tequila... more! I know it's meant to be floor, but this place has so many wonderful tequilas you will want more before you hit the floor.   In the summertime this place has a beautiful back patio, and if tequila isn't your thing, I think you're weird, but that's OK. They've got lots of other drink choices from reasonably priced craft beer to nice whiskey cocktails.   I hadn't been in the winter until last week, and it stands up in the snowy months, too. I was at a private party in their side room and they had a projector and music jumping and obviously let the person decorate for their event. Fun fun.   Be aware: If you weren't there for the party, there was a cover. What the what?"}
{"text":"I would give 3 1/2 but the band was great so giving extra.  I didn't get any food but tried few of their drinks.  Acapulco Gold, their house margarita, ruby red something, and they were all pretty good.  The band was playing so we paid $5 cover to get in and it was packed and loud.  I liked the music they were playing so I didn't mind but it was loud.  So if you don't like the music, you have to go outside in the back and even though they got heaters, it would get pretty cold in the winter."}
{"text":"Omg do I adore this little bar, so adorable. Mini patio at the back. In fact, they opened two bars for the event I was at. The second bar was in a different room actually. BTW: I didn't come here for a Yelp event!! It was an entirely different event.  So our event was 6 to 9pm ish. The open bar closed at 9:30.... but they continued the night with some jazz music and served regular customers. Kudos!!  They have some pretty neat drinks. Sorry if \"neat\" is a nerdy word.  - mango margarita (with a piece of mango!) - blood orange juice + vodka (SO amazing) or tequila (not as amazing) - blood orange margarita?   I enjoyed lots of my drinks but honestly I am going to apologize as I do not remember the REAL name of any of these drinks. However they have many different kinds of tequila, and YES you can do tequila tasters: 7 different tequila shots. That's what you can do :) I had two of those... they tasted like tequila.... but it was fun. The chaser for tequila is a spicy tomato juice of some very amazing sort.  My coworker had some spicy cocktail, something with \"Red\" in the name. Spicy, hot, but really really nice.   I also had the crab cakes here -spicy! Very soft and tender crabmeat as well, it was good.  I'd love to come back sometime -NOT due to an event! I very much enjoyed the location, the really friendly/casual bar, lots of summer drinks, cute patio, JAZZ @ NIGHT?... also I was carded!! Why was I carded at AN EVENT I WAS INVITED TO!!?"}
