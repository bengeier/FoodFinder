The staff is friendly. Very clean looking."}
{"text":"This is great sushi restaurant. Fish is fresh. Menu items are very creative. And the service is great. The staff are friendly, professional, and caring. Definitely an A+."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My family comes here quite frequently because it has turned into our favorite sushi joint. The people are kind and treat us like family, the sushi is some of the best tasting and freshest sushi we have ever had. It's a great atmosphere and a lovely place to grab a few rolls with my family."}
{"text":"Blue Sushi is fantastic. I used to eat at Pure... not anymore. Just by dining here once, it's evident that decent portions, great service, and excellent food quality are all things that you get at Blu. I wouldn't get sushi anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  If you want \"fresh\", this place has never let me down.  It's tucked away in a prime N Scottsdale area, near an AJ's.  This is a comfortable environment, and my number one sushi restaurant.  I'm new to reviews, but felt compelled to write about this place."}
{"text":"This wonderful little Hideaway tucked in Pima and Pinnacle Peak has the most excellent food wonderful staff and the freshest ingredients I have ever had in the entire Valley area."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this sushi establishment. Great find in North Scottsdale. Amazing sushi rolls, fresh uni, salads and unique hot rolls are also delicious!  
Staff always friendly. Sushi chef is fantastic with a true artistic flare!"}
{"text":"I just officially had the best sushi in AZ if not in most of the country. I let the chef select and everything was amazing. Soy sauce would be a sin to put on this. Tuna, yellowtail and a stripped bass. I'm still waiting for my \"special roll\" and I can't wait. Don't let the outside fool you. This place is legitimate!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch for the first time here. Took my best friend who just came back from japan, we both loved it and he said that this place is \"legit\". Great food, great service, and even better environment. Recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Sushi is incredible!! Hidden gem in north Scottsdale. Staff is friendly and the owner is passionate about the quality! Traditional sushi spot with a modern twist!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi place.  Menu is huge!  Soooo many sushi options to choose from.  The Inferno Roll is amazing! Staff is super friendly and helpful.  A definite \"recommend\".  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. The owners are a little weird but the waitresses are nice and the food is excellent and that's all that matters. Happy hour is the best thing it's not too expensive"}
{"text":"I do not care how a place is decorated and as long as the background music is unobtrusive (loud , hate filled rap) , what about the food?  Wifey and I had lunch and tried the bento box. Dumplings were very tasty, the three pieces of Tempura were light, the California Roll was good and the Terriaki Chicken was better than average. This was a great introduction. The final test? How is the Sushi/rolls ? To be continued but so far, I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Being recently returned from Japan after living 4 years in Tokyo, the food at Blu Sushi is the best Japanese food that we have had in Arizona.  The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Went here twice while on vacation for the week. Great happy hour deals. We tried some rolls and the chicken and vegetable fried rice. All was amazing"}
{"text":"We've been passing this place for months but always forget it's there. We ordered take out tonight & couldn't be more pleased. Everything tasted fresh & delicious. So nice to have a great sushi spot in the neighborhood! I'd post photos but we are everything too quickly to capture any. Can't wait to dine in and check the place out again."}
{"text":"Fresh!! Best sushi in North Scottsdale.  Try the garlic edamame, white tuna sashimi & shrimp fried rice!  Great service.  Go for the food!"}
{"text":"What a great find in North Scottsdale!  Nice, sleek atmosphere, and quality, fresh ingredients.

We were warmly greeted by two employees (one of whom ended up being our waiter - a very personable guy from Southern California).  The menu was a little overwhelming, so we asked for our server's recommendations, all of which turned out to be fantastic, fresh, and innovative.  We especially liked the Beautiful Blu, Fire, and Blazing Shrimp rolls.  

Our server was helpful and attentive, without being overbearing.  The sushi chef came over to check on us a few times, too, which we thought was a nice touch.  While we were having dinner, several people (of all ages) came in who were obviously regulars; they were all greeted and served warmly, whether they were dining in or just picking up takeout.  We could tell that the Blu Sushi staff is definitely focused on customer service.

If we lived in Scottsdale, we'd be back here all the time to tackle the rest of the menu!  If you live close by, you're in luck - Blu Sushi is definitely a winner."}
{"text":"This is a new establishment but I can say it was one of the more frustrating experiences for my husband and I. I hate when reviewers comment on the decor first .... But this place is really nothing special. I read the reviews prior - so food reviews were pretty good - and though we should try it. To our dismay we ordered some nigiri - Spanish Mackerel + salmon and a spicy yellowtail maki. Nigiri was a no-go. The quality of the rice was not what we expected, especially for the price point. They should charge much less due to the quality of the fish. There is no denying that his place may do \"okay\" as they have a ton of Maki and Speciality Rolls to offer non-traditionalists. The quality was not there and My advice would be to go to Toyoma if your looking for authentic Japanese sushi in north Scottsdale. I will say the staff and owner were very kind and friendly, and wanted to learn about our experience. Having had the best and some of the worst sushi throughout my years, it's important to keep in mind the quality and price point really have to meet eye to eye. For the price point they offer - I'd go to Toyoma or even Sushi Roku. For quality comparison- I'd go to Teharu on Frank Loyd Wright."}
{"text":"Fantastic and unique sushi with excellent service.  We will be back. Nigiri was great.  Try the sweetheart roll.  You'll never want to order a plain California roll again."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews are for lunch which is ok.  Do not recommend for dinner.  Overpriced for what you get in terms of quality, portions and enviroment...."}
{"text":"Did not realize this sushi grill was right at Pinnacle Pk and Pima. Stopped on our way home and had some happy hour sushi rolls and wine.  Mr.M was our waiter and Chef Kim was preparing food.  I thought Mr. M was part owner or relative since he talked so well of the place and food. Our sushi rolls were wonderful and the seaweed salad is great! Will def go back!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal here!  love the cloth napkins and immediate service.  we ordered the baked mussels, edamame, fire dragon roll and crunch rolll. The flavors were terrific and no sauce was over served or too thick but perfectly applied. The dragon roll with several types of fish was superb!  
Tucked into AJ's shopping center next to CVS, this location is ideal for quick access off Pima road."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Been looking for a good sushi place in AZ since moving here in June. Finally found one. 

The monkey brains (really just a stuffed mushroom) were delicious and the pear martini was so so good. 

This place isn't anything super fancy, but the service was great and food was too!"}
{"text":"I have been here four times in the past month and am thrilled to have such a quality sushi spot in North Scottsdale. The decor may be sparse but the food more than makes up for it. The sushi is always super fresh, the fish expertly cut and the rolls creative and delicious. 

Jenny (or Ginny?) who operates the place really cares and will go out of her way to make sure you're satisfied and happy. The sushi chef is not only great at what he does but is also very friendly and goes above and beyond to ensure a great experience. 

If you're into fresh, quality sushi this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Tried Blu Sushi for the first time tonight...loved it. We ordered several appetizers. All of them tasted great.  the gyoza was especially good. Tried a few fried rice and spicy yaki udon. All a hit! The sushi was fresh and just right. Overall an excellent experience. Nice people who work there. They weren't busy but I suspect it's due to there somewhat hidden location.  Highly recommend this place for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had.The service was amazing and the ambiance was great! We were sat right away and the server gave us great recommendations. Not a bad thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Seriously some of the best fish ever. Friendly staff make you feel like you are eating with family. Don't let the strip mall deter you. This is one place not to miss"}
{"text":"While the food is good, the service is HORRIBLE!  We waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order and then it took over one hour for them to serve us two shrimp tempura rolls.  The management here needs to hire more help.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"The best thing about Blu Sushi was that the fish was fresh.  The selection of fish was very limited, not at all inspiring.  Omakase should not be two types of tuna, salmon and sea bass.  The recommended dishes were all fried, not sushi to me.  The rice on the rolls was refrigerator cold, as opposed to warm as it should be.  The fresh wasabi wasn't freshly grated, but rather a chili waasabi.  Finally, the plates were plastic.  Sorry I didn't go to Toyama , just up the street."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I've eaten in all of Arizona. I highly recommend the dynamite volcano roll. It was unlike any roll I've ever had- melt in your mouth delicious! We also loved the Geisha and the Arizona rolls. Service was great and atmosphere was nice too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately their menu lists items they NEVER have (intend to have?) As in the Bulgogi Korean BBQ- 0 for 3 and a strike out as far as I am concerned!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SUSHI!! My husband and I love this place.  great service, very friendly staff.  The owner and manager always go out of their way to say hello and will often stop by the table to check on your meal.  The attentive service doesn't feel intrusive but makes the dining experience even better.  The prices are very reasonable and I have found consistently delicious sushi each time I eat here. Definitely try this place,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"To the comment Lance wrote I find that hard to believe I go there almost everyday for lunch since its by my work and once in awhile for dinner since its been opened.  The owner Jinny is very nice she goes above and beyond to make sure your experience is amazing. The servers are very attentive as well. Everytime I'm there the chef has never left, why would a chef leave if its a sushi restaurant? I'm sure the owner probably wouldn't allow that. I just find it hard to believe. You'll have to go in and just meet them you'll be very pleased with your experience there. Most importantly though the sushi was amazing! I love the Az Roll, Marilyn Monroll, and the fire roll. I've also ordered yellowtail sashimi very fresh! For the dinner entrees so far ive only tried beef fried rice and the bulgogi very delicious! Im originally from Californis and this is definitely my new sushi spot,  I hope more people support this place."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, great prices, and the staff remember you and greet you with a warm smile upon your return. I have been here at least a dozen times and the food never disappoints. My favorites are the sushi tapas section...creative flavors combined with buttery, mouth-watering fish. Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Tried lunch rolls. Service was poor considering there was only 1 table. Took forever to take order. Asked for 2 different rolls but both were the same. Food is ok nothing outstanding but the decor is cool and hip."}
{"text":"I'm a huge foodie. This place rocks. Who cares about the decor when the food is this tasty. Right on!"}
{"text":"I come here about once every 1-2 weeks for a light dinner. The food is consistently fresh and beautifully prepared and the owner and staff are welcoming and always attentive. I am so glad this is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I frequent many sushi restaurants and this amazing place has the freshest fish and friendliest service in the Scottsdale area! It's very hidden within a large shopping center (Aj's and cvs) 
You will not be disappointed with your choice to come here! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great atmosphere. Make sure to try the Beautiful Blu, Dragon, Rock and Roll, and Fire rolls. You'll love the friendly waitstaff!! Must try for sushi people."}
{"text":"Just got home from Blu Sushi and we are still talking about how delicious and amazing our meal was! The owner Jinny and server Min were wonderful and did everything they could to make our family dinner enjoyable. We tried sake (coconut, cucumber, and traditional) and the Mule cocktail made with homemade ginger ingredients. Wow! Sushi was exceptional and brought us back to our days of living in Chicago...this restaurant meets the standards that some of the best sushi restaurants in Chicago provided. We chose two sushi rolls and had Min select another two, including the Fire Dragon, 3rd St, Slick, and a Rainbow. We also had sake nigiri and it could've melted in our mouths! Thank you again to the staff! We'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"This is some of the best, freshest sushi at a very affordable price that I have had in the 13 years we have lived in Scottsdale!   The owner / manager came over to help with the service and was very informative. 
We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!  Some of the freshest sushi & sashimi I have ever eaten.  Extensive menu with many specialty rolls."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I found it hard to find good sushi in AZ. However, my search ended when I found Blu Sushi. I've been to both locations - Scottsdale and Litchfield Park and this is the best sushi in AZ by far. Creative, fresh and delicious. Owners and staff are welcoming and hospitable. I have recommended it to all of my friends and bring out of towners here regularly."}
{"text":"Decided to try it since there were 4.5 stars averaged from 98 people.  The sushi was just ok.  The decor was clean, but also just okay.  We didn't go during happy hour, but we ordered from their \"deal menu\".  We ordered the following:

1) 3 sushi roll combo
-1 CA roll
-1 salmon roll
-1 tuna roll
-$11-$15 (don't remember exactly how much) 

2) bento box
-1 shrimp tempura, 1 zucchini tempura, 1 onion ring tempura (tempura sauce was too sweet).
-1 CA roll
-1 salmon nigiri, 1 tuna nigiri, 1 shrimp nigiri
-small salad
-$15.  

I've had delicious sushi rolls and bento boxes, but these were nothing to rave about.  The service was as expected, but also nothing extraordinary.  The water tasted like dirt, but I guess I didn't expect tap water to taste like bottled Fiji water."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Scottsdale!!! Super fresh and so delicious!  The sushi chef was so friendly and explained all the fish to us. I can't wait to go back.   Go check it out. I wish them much success!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  It's the best sushi we have found in Phoenix/Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Lamp was closed so we had to call an audible.  This was a refreshing change.  We showed up here and the sushi was priced nicely and the quality is there.  I'll be back... we all enjoyed our dishes."}
{"text":"We love sushi and have been to places in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and many other metropolitan areas. This is by far the best inner state (Arizona) sushi bar we have been to. The service is excellent! The fish is fresh and the chefs are always accommodating (shellfish allergy)! I wouldn't say cheap because the quality is excellent but the prices are more than fair. Come and check it out I'm sure everyone would love it!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  I've been to all the sushi restaurants in this area and Blu Sushi is the best.  Friendly atmosphere and the skinny margaritas are a great accompaniment to the creative sushi dishes."}
{"text":"Had lunch/early dinner here for my friends bday. The sushi rolls were amazingly good. The fried rice, yakisoba and Goyza were yummy. The restaurant was nice and open when I come in. The owner was friendly and really got to know you. A must eat when it comes to a good dinner and sushi. Next time I'm in Scottsdale I'll come eat here again. Wonderful experience"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They go above and beyond to make sure your satisfied. Great customer service, sushi was very fresh and the rolls were fairly priced. The owner Jinny is very friendly as well. I recommend you try this hidden place out. Im a connoisseur when it comes to fresh sushi and this place has the taste!"}
{"text":"Extremely high quality sushi.  Everything in the north scottsdale area is fairly good but this place was just better.  Very fresh ingredients, unique rolls, nice pieces of fish in each roll, presentation on point and they randomly had deschutes fresh squeezed on tap.

I like supporting local.  A woman, im assuming owner or some sort of vested interest, came up to us and asked how everything was and had a genuine interest that we enjoyed everything.  Its a small gesture but its becoming a lost art form in most restaurants.

I'll go back, the food is way too good not to.  Huge menu of rolls as well, I have about 7 more I want to try"}
{"text":"This place is delicious - we tried a variety of items & they were all fantastic.  Definitely be going back."}
{"text":"An excellent selection of lovely fishes, including the uncommon crudai & escolar, both of which were terrific. Decent sake offerings. Very attentive service ~ our server could not have been kinder or more accommodating. We would definitely come back here next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Daughter and I both had the 6 piece nigiri combo for $20. We stopped by after her volleyball game since the yelp reviews were good and we were close by. The rice fell apart under the nigiri pieces. The fish slices were slim and the quality was the same as Teharu(cheap and easy). The spicy tuna roll that came with the combo was bland and smushy. 40$ later, I'd rather have spent my sushi bucks elsewhere. Plus sides: clean, nice interior, patio. Service was typical."}
{"text":"Great date night here. Food was delicious. Sat at the bar and had wonderful conversation with sushi chef/owner. We'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Beautifully presented food, and food quality was TOP NOTCH.  The salmon nigiri was so tender that it practically melted in my mouth!  I also got spicy tuna and caterpillar rolls, and my boyfriend had the best fried rice of his life.  By far the best sushi I've had since moving to AZ, and I've been to quite a few in the North Phoenix/Scottsdale and Sedona areas."}
{"text":"This place serves really fresh sushi. We had the maguro sushi, Ebi, tamago, the Alaska roll and the chicken teriyaki roll. It was all delicious and beautifully presented. If you like stuffed mushrooms, you've got to try their Monkey Brain appetizer - tempura mushroom stuffed with cream cheese and spicy crab drizzled with tasty sauces."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Sushi place. The food is excellent as well as the service. We like to sit at the sushi bar and they'll make you whatever type of special roll or dish you like. We live in North Scottsdale and finally there is a \"special\" place to go and not the same old sushi restaurants. Blu is unique and definitely a gem! I highly recommend to all sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"We were a little skeptical about this place because it was in a strip mall. Boy were we pleasantly surprised. Hands down one of the best sushi places in Scottsdale. Much better than Pure Sushi and prices are extremely fair. The Inferno Roll and the Blazin Shrimp are fantastic if you love spicy rolls. The monkey brains were also fantastic! They even made it with corn starch since my wife can't have wheat flour. Definitely coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Standard sushi. Extremely small portions for the expense. But that's North Scottsdale for ya!"}
{"text":"Drove out of the way to check this place out as it had such a high Yelp rating and I'm glad I did. It's in a location surrounded by more old and stodgy than young and hip, was reasonably empty when we arrived at 8 on a Friday, but that was to my delight. 

The dynamite volcano roll was amazing, drinks were well priced and while the sushi rolls were pricey, they were no more pricey than other sushi joints in the area. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"What a great find! Was in town visiting friends and Yelped this great sushi place. Really creative, excellent quality, very fresh. Fun and helpful wait staff, especially Rafael. The chef was creative and the rolls inventive. Accommodated a severe food allergy in our party and went out of their way to make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"NOT only did they entirely screw up our order, they do not answer the phone, missing items. HORRIBLE PLACE. DO NOT GO!!!!!! this has happened countless number of times.  I am done with this place."}
{"text":"BLU HAS THE MOST AMAZING SALMON SAKE SASHIMI RIGHT NOW.  GO GET SOME BEFORE I EAT IT ALL... 

Another amazing visit... four people, four orders of salmon sake *and* a visit from the sushi chef.  Seriously, go.  Right now.  Do not pass go but do collect $200 and take it with you.  Order all the things."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!  This was our first time visiting.  The decor is lacking but you can't beat the food.  We visited around 12-ish on a Saturday.  There was only one other table which was surprising.  We ordered the spicy crab rolls and egg rolls which were delicious.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special chicken teriyaki bowl, which by the way was horrible, it was dry and had no sauce. In the past I've ordered the same thing which is why I ordered again because it was reasonable
1. I was charged $17 for dinner entree, when I ordered lunch. I ordered around 1:30pm how is that dinner. 
2. I asked to speak to the manager and he refused to talk come up and talk to me. 

3. The lady who was helping me had no customer service whatsoever, all she could say was I'll let the other lady who charged me last know that she charged the wrong price because we don't have a lunch menu. 

This is the the last time I will be coming here, I will not pay $17 for a small piece of chicken that was dry and looked like it was sitting there for days. Spent $24 for lunch that was garbage. I tossed it."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and were told 25 minutes but the food was not even warm when we got it home. I was disappointed overall in the food. Nothing was really tasty and the mixed tempura had two thin shrimp one onion ring and two pieces of sweet potato not much to eat. The fried rice with chicken was ok but as I said everything was pretty cold. We also had crispy calamari salad but not crispy and egg rolls.  Probably not going back. Too bad because I was looking forward to trying it"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - we went on a Monday night (birthday dinner), which violates my rules of sushi in Phoenix (don't go on Mondays)

We got a nice assortment of nigiri and maki.  The nigiri was pretty good, and they had some pretty interesting maki, too!  The presentations are very nice.

Also, for appetizers...Ninja Tears - how can you not?  (Jalapeño popper type things - tasty!)

Some of the folks at the table ordered ramen, etc. too.

Very nice, and we'll have to try it again on a weekend sometime soon"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  
The calamari and chicken appetizers were great.  Sushi fresh and well presented."}
{"text":"We can here last Saturday night and had the best experience!! We were greeted by Jinny the owner and had the best service by her!! She truly goes above and beyond. She suggested a winterberry cocktail which was amazing considering I don't drink cocktails. It was made with Tito's vodka and fresh juice, none of that premade mixer crap. Then had the smoked salmon nigiri which was perfect, then the fire blue special roll and the blazing shrimp. Both were amazing but the blazing shrimp was my favorite, spicy but not kill you spicy. All in all we will be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for a good sushi place!k"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I l LOVE this place!! The service and the food is spectacular. If you check-in via Yelp, they will reward you with a free edamame, so don't forget to check in Yelpers! 

Their garlic edamame, BOMB. So good! Our other favorites are:

Calamari tempura, YUM! | Cherry Blossom roll --- really any of their rolls are delicious as they take pride in their fish, their rice and their presentation. If you're looking for a spot to enjoy really amazing Sushi, stop by Blu Sushi, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Blu has everything you need in a neighborhood sushi bar. The fish is ridiculously fresh and the menu is creative. It's not just same 5 fish reorganized in various dishes, it's an expansive array of options that can serve all tastes. My wife is pregnant and she had many options for cooked fish/rolls and traditional Japanese/Korean cuisine. I tried the ono and their signature blue roll, and they were buttery and fresh. We'll certainly be back. If you live in north Scottsdale and you need a neighborhood go-to sushi joint, look no further."}
{"text":"This is one of our families favorite restaurants in the entire area!!! We have dinner at Blu several times a month and are always treated so well. The sushi is so fresh and delicious, Jenny (the owner) will not allow substandard food to be served. We have never had a bad experience and have been dining there since they opened. There are also many gluten free options for those of you looking! Perfect place for friends to meet and families to gather. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi to go 
I went in for lunch and the parking lot was being repaved so I wanted to take it to go. Unfortunately it wasn't pleasant to eat there with the tar smell. However they wouldn't let me order the lunch special so that was a bummer."}
{"text":"Wow, fantastic rolls. The Pinnacle Peak and Seared Ahi rolls were incredible! They have the most extensive sushi menu I have ever seen. The staff kept coming to our table to check on us. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi loved the portion size. Big menu selection for all tastes. Service was disappointing.
Spoke to the manager who acknowledged the issue"}
{"text":"Blu Sushi is great! I would give iThe monkey brains are outstanding, along with the Vegas roll.  Very fast service."}
{"text":"We moved here from LA, been trying to find a great sushi place in North Scottsdale. Blue Sushi is by far the best! The sushi/sashimi is so fresh. The owners Jeannie and Richard are very friendly and they make restaurant very warm and welcoming. I don't miss J-town in LA anymore!"}
{"text":"Delicious. This is our favorite sushi place in the north Scottsdale area and it is so close to our home, we come regularly. We love the blazing shrimp sushi roll. Just amazing!  They also have happy hour 2-6 m-f which is great. Lots of rolls for 5 and 7 dollars. They have a full bar also. The sushi is of very high quality as the owner also has a successful sushi resultant in the west valley. We just love this place."}
{"text":"I got turned onto this place by a friend of mine don't let the inconspicuous façade fool you this place is filled with talent. Put your trust in sushi chef Johnny and allow him to take your pallet on a culinary adventure. Add to that the welcoming wait staff and i guarantee you will return."}
{"text":"The absolute best and FRESH sushi in Phoenix and better than any sushi I've had in Cali - no over exaggeration!  I think we tried about every fish our first visit.  Impeccable presentation and variety that you won't find anywhere else.  I live more than 1/2 hour away and will travel here anytime I want sushi.  No doubt, this is my sushi - go - to!  They even have tilapia sushi and rolls that you couldn't even imagine putting together!  Jung (sushi chef) is friendly, accommodating and is a true chef.  The staff and owner are extremely welcoming and friendly.  You must try this place and then get hooked!  In the evening on certain days of the week, they have a live band as well.  This place is rockin' and rollin'!  5+ stars!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but the service was so slow.  When we got there, there was only one other couple so they were not busy at all. We ordered our sushi, which took a while to come and then put in another order for a simple 2 piece. By that time there were 3 other tables that had arrived. We had finished all of our food and were still waiting on that one order. We almost left it took so long. I can't imagine how slow this place would be on a busy night with a full restaurant. Like I said, the sushi was good. The waitress was friendly. Also, note that the crab on the menu in the sushi section is fake crab. So, when you order \"kani\" they will tell you, oh that's fake crab but you can get real crab for extra. But they don't tell you how much extra and she wasn't sure. It was $8 extra, which I thought was expensive. Plus, most sushi restaurants don't use the imitation unless they label it \"krab\"... And they certainly don't try to pull one over on you. I thought that was shady. Also we didn't think the sushi chef seemed very friendly - usually sushi bar chefs tell you hello and goodbye and smile at you etc when you come in and out. Didn't experience that here. Maybe it was an off night, I'm not sure but definitely not a good first impression. I might give this place one more shot only because the food was good and that's the only reason they even get 3 stars. But they better pick up the pace - service that slow will never survive in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place to eat !!! Sushi is fresh and absolutely delicious and the staff is great !!! A must for anyone who loves sushi !!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, 
how did I miss this gem. 
 Been driving past it and never focused on it in the AJ's strip mall. Searched for sushi nearby and found it right under my nose. 
Well, Food is fresh and amazing.
 Sooooo many choices, I cant wait to go back and try more.
 Décor is lacking, but who cares, your there to eat great sushi.
So go now, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their sushi is amazing, all high quality ingredients, very fresh, fast service. Strongly reccomend."}
{"text":"Great sushi!!! Horrible service! I've been in for lunch a few times and the \"bartender\" didn't know how to make the featured drink or one off of the menu. I've also been in to pick up a to go order and asked for extra soy sauce. The young kid told me I shouldn't use that much. Another time I was at a table having lunch and the same kid said to me, \"what do you do  for a living that you can come in here in the middle of the afternoon and order a martini \". I've been eating here since they opened a couple years ago I just love the food. Maybe someday they will have the service to match."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent!!

Fresh... Very friendly staff. 

Found our new favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and are super happy to have this spot in the hood. We leave ourselves in the hands of the chef and he takes such good care of us. I've tried new things - Saba - Uni- and old favorites. They have a ton of rolls but we've been very happy with sashimi and nigiri. Now they have live music on Friday nights and it's just a nice friendly low key neighborhood spot. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"High quality sushi is hard to find. Not here. Rolls have great creativity and even better flavor. Nigiri is fresh and a great value."}
{"text":"Amazing service!  I love the blazing shrimp roll.  The kids loved the popcorn shrimp roll and the ice cream.  If you like sushi and live in North Scottsdale, you should give Blu a try!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. We got some sushi, appetizer, desert. Overall not bed, but i cant say it was the best. Calamari feels fresh, and chewy but not yammy!! One thing i really dislike was water. It smells so bed. Its definitely not a filter water. I hope they use filter water even during making sushi."}
{"text":"Best Sushi since getting to Arizona! And a great spicy cucumber and fresh ginger martini"}
{"text":"Richard is the bomb in making sushi rolls ! 
Best in the valley 2018 ! Very unique rolls 
Best quality and variety of sushi ! 
Explosion of flavors ! 
Pinnacle Peak and Pima next to AJs 
Incredible personalized service by both he and his staff"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because it was close to our hotel and open at 3 pm. The place was pretty empty. Service was good. They offered special foods to our 2 year old and were very understanding of her general state of rambunctiousness. Wish that I could give a better review of the food. The fish portions were very small and tasted somewhat fishy. The spicy tuna and yellow tail were prepared with some sort of chile powder instead of the typical creamy spicy sauce that I am accustomed to and had an overall off putting flavor and texture. Would not recommend this place overall for the food."}
{"text":"Tried Blu Sushi recently and will not be returning. Being that it was our first time, we tried an array of sushi options from your standard rolls such as a spicy tuna roll to some of their specialty rolls. We even tried one of their cooked options, the teriyaki salmon plate. The fish on the rolls seemed old and/or low quality while the salmon was overly cooked and almost uneatable.  
For the prices and quality,there are much better options, including near by grocery stores within driving distance to curb your sushi fancy."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience here. Came for early dinner. Served by the owner & the service was excellent. She was friendly, genuine & fast with all our requests. The daily special of toro sashimi was amazing. Probably the best we had in AZ so far. The soft shell crab, AZ roll (super spicy), shrimp tempura ....were all good. Definitely come back food the food & proximity to our home."}
{"text":"Blu Sushi from the outside looks very unassuming.  However, they have a great open restaurant and outside seating.  I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality of the food and friendliness of the staff - especially Kay.  Make a point to say hello !  We will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed trying this sushi restaurant 
Their specialty sushi was very good
Everything was freshly made including their iced tea!!!
The rolls were tight with thin amount of rice so you could enjoy the the rest of the ingredients"}
{"text":"I was anxious for this place to open because of our desire for another sushi option in north Scottsdale. Upon entering, we quickly noticed how starkly decorated it is. Not in a modernist way, but more like unfinished way. Next, while I always enjoy background music in restaurants, the playlist was filled with forty year old pop songs and some Nat King Cole standards. Not sure what they are going for.   The staff is very nice and attentive. We ordered a glass of wine but noticed that the open bottle had the cork stuck partially back in. This concerned me that the wine could of been opened weeks ago and gone bad. However, as it turned out, the wine was fine. An investment of a few wine vacuum stoppers should be in order.
Finally, we ordered the sushi along with some egg rolls and a lobster roll. The food was tasty.
Some changes to the decor would make this place more appealing."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Blu Sushi for many years we live just a  mile away. Great place to come when they are slow which is most of the time, but they can't handle a busy schedule. We went on a Friday night trying to catch a movie an hour and fifteen minutes later. We told the owner this upon our arrival. It took us fifteen minutes to get two sakes and another fifteen minutes to place an order at the sushi bar.  There were only two servers for the whole restaurant and only one sushi chef.  It took over an hour to get our meal, when we received the first order I had asked for chop sticks and a soy bowl to dip and never got one. Finally I grabbed one off another table.  Also had to grab some low sodium soy since the staff was too busy to attend to us. There were several tables that arrived after us that received their meals before ours, so much for being loyal regulars . Really disappointed as we have been to this place at least twenty times.  Fortunately we have many choices close by so this will be our last time dining at Blu Sushi. :("}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in the Valley. Fresh fish and a wide selection of rolls. The staff are always friendly and offering suggestions. Often times they give you items just to show off other things on the menu. I highly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch, however service is not there. We where only 2 of 3 customers and had to wait for someone to check on us. Sushi was good though...for a land locked state."}
{"text":"After living in the Bay area for decades, we got used to great Japanese food. Three years ago when we moved to Scottsdale, we started our quest for the best Japanese restaurant. We had a couple we liked but since finding Blu Sushi, we've found one we LOVE! The menu is large and everything we had was perfect.  The sushi I had was generous and super fresh. The roll selection is amazing. Prices were fair and the service was very attentive Parking very easy in this strip mall. Full bar too. A great addition to the Scottsdale food scene."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi joint located in North Scottsdale.

We ordered deluxe red sushi which came with 30 pieces of sushi with six different kinds of fishes. Let me tell you their price is high here, perhaps north Scottsdale price but fish grade was very high, they purchase high quality of fish.

Owner Jinny was our server and she had a very nice smile.  Great quality sushi with friendly service."}
{"text":"I love going to Blu Sushi whenever I get the chance!! The rolls are awesome, the service is always very fast, and they're willing to make custom rolls based on whatever you ask for! Their iced green tea is also super refreshing :) I'm happy to have a sushi joint so close to home, with great quality food & awesome service!"}
{"text":"Found this place randomly and it is absolutely amazing! They have an extensive menu with lots of sushi options! I highly recommend you sit at the sushi bar and order the dynamite lobster roll! This is a great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I really laid like  here- all items are fresh


No Longer any good !! Be.      delicious- my one criticism is the music is too loud and not relaxing!- chef has changed , food no longer good and expensive!"}
{"text":"This is a new and much needed sushi restaurant in Northeast Scottsdale.  It is replacing another restaurant, which I never went to.  It's nicely decorated, quite pretty actually, with a long sushi bar, and an outdoor bar with a passthrough to the inside.  Nice little fenced outdoor patio also.  it's in a strip shopping center, but a nice one anchored by the local upscale grocer, AJs.  The sushi is always fresh and very good.  The owner is very eager to please and always comes to check on us.  My girlfriend and I love sushi and had to give up on our favorite place down on Bell Road as the area was getting sketchier by the week.  It's not cheap but it's not ridiculous either.  The green tea is usually genmaicha, which is my favorite.  If you like good sushi in a pretty, clean place with friendly staff, check it out.  It has become our favorite new sushi haunt."}
{"text":"Going by the good ****1/2 star reviews, I was looking forward to having fine sushi at Blu Sushi in Scottsdale. I was happy to know that they had outside seating so I can also bring along my Micky (who is a two-year old Bishon Frisse-Chihuahua mix. I digress). 
The only good thing that came out of this experience was that I got a free bowl of edadame upon checking in through this app. The rest was an epic fail.

For starters, it was hard to find.
The wait was at least 1 1-2 hours. Granted we came on a Friday evening, but the place was not at all packed.
Then the food came. Ordered a bowl of ramen noodle soup (for my son, who said that it was just \"alright, not great\". Not anywhere as good as the ones at Santoku inside the Mitsuwa Marketplace in Torrance, CA). Also ordered three sushi rolls. They looked pretty small to me--at least by a third. For the $15-16 price per roll, I was disappointed and really mad at how exorbitant these prices were for the smaller size of each roll. Never mind the flavor nor the presentation--no star for either one.
I took a picture of my sashimi platter, which came with a price tag of $40.00, for twenty measly and boring slices of the usual suspects--five each of salmon, tuna, red snapper (? Not sure), and yellowtail. The platter itself was adorned only with the shredded radish, on a plain white plate. There was no other embellishment, not even a twist of lemon nor a fake leaf. I doubt they were trying to go for the minimalist look. My point is, I expected a sashimi platter that has been elevated to a culinary feast for the eyes, just like most Japanese foods tend to be.
Service as a whole was bad. Didn't get any offers of refills for our water, not until towards the end of our dinner. 
I wanted to cancel my sashimi order but the lady said--\"he (the sushi chef) is already cutting (the fish)\". 

So, our 2 1/2 hour dinner came out to roughly $116.00, for sushi that, at best, was mediocre. Left me wondering, wth made people give this place a 4+ star rating??

Needless to say, not gonna go back there. Harumi Sushi on Adams St, in Phoenix, remains THE sushi place to be."}
{"text":"Went here New Years Eve. Absolutely delicious. Definitely my favorite sushi spot in this state!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a different sushi spot. WOW! We are so glad we tried Blu Sushi. The staff is top notch!! We were treated like V.I.P's. The variety of rolls is endless and delicious. We had the Slick and Inferno. Both were fantastic and as fresh as it gets. This will be our go to Sushi spot!! They have only been open for four months. I hope all goes well for them. They are the nicest people. The Sushi Chef made a few special on the house items for us. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this sushi restaurants reviews are over inflated. Service was very spotty
The sushi was warm, the ramen soup was tasteless 
And finally two hot teas were seven dollars
Which takes me to one of my yelp rules when you see A restaurant has four a half stars and less than 150 reviews beware!"}
{"text":"This really is a hidden gym as others have stated. This has to be due to its location. They have incredible rolls and apps that I have never seen anywhere else. The monkey brains are absolutely amazing despite the name. The sushi chef is one of the funniest and most personable open chef kitchens I have ever come across. The cocktails are also very strong and I wouldn't plan on driving after a few drinks. This place will not let you down and will make you a return guest."}
{"text":"The Sushi/Maki here is UNMATCHED in creativity, freshness.  If I am allowed to verge on poetic, the maki rolls are are lite delicately flavored clouds.  So light and yet not without substance.

If I can give one piece of advise for Blu Sushi...and any sushi restaurant for that matter, it would be to always sit as close to the chef as possible and ALWAYS attempt to learn about their craft directly from them.  On this occasion, my wife and I were quite fortunate to sit in front of Richard, the owner and chef for over 10 years.  Not only is Richard a master of his craft but he is a great conversationalist in all things sushi, restaurant and even foreign travel.

We started with Spicy Edamame.  The garlic is sweet and balanced the not-too-hot chili sauce.  

Next, we shared four maki (aka sushi rolls, albeit \"sushi is actually freshly cut fish over hand packed rice).
1. Dynamite Lobster Tempura Roll:  this is a beautiful dish that actually eats as two.  The lobster tempura on top is very light (possibly fried in rice oil?) but the lobster underneath is appropriately firm, not mealy, and deeply flavorful.  The roll underneath is a simple California Roll but the krab is so light and the roll packed to perfection such that it isn't dense but still hold with a chopstick pickup.  Looking around the restaurant, this dish appears to be a favorite...with no unhappy faces.
2. Japanese Burrito: a soy paper wrap replaces traditional seaweed in this hand roll.  Inside is the most delicious mix of spicy tuna, krab, and shrimp tempura separates in layers with avocado, butter lettuce and small sticks of cucumber.  I have never had such a cravable hand roll!  This dish alone would bring me back many times.
3. Beautiful Blu: spicy tuna with crunch inside topped with fresh tuna.  Richard sprinkled a small amount of roe (tiny fish eggs that give the sushi/maki a little salty pop).  A great staple for those not too adventurous but wanting a very fresh representation.
4. Japanese Pesto:  we didn't see this on the menu, but Chef Richard suggested we try it.  DELICIOUS and creative mix of two different cultures.  Essentially this is a tuna roll with avocado drizzled with a very light pesto sauce.  It doesn't sound like it should work but it does without question.

At this point we were expecting to be done but the conversation was great and Chef Richard treated us to some tempura fried salmon skin lightly topped with a seven spice and scallion.  This could easily be a regular appetizer offering.  Every bit as flavorful as salmon sushi but enhanced by the light batter and scallion.

Since it was my birthday, gluttony was permitted.  Chef Richard brought out a tempura fried slice of cheese cake with French vanilla.  Fun way to cap a great meal...and discover that next notch on my belt.  At least my sock size is the same as in high school.

You should give the restaurant a try.  If it is busy, expect a slower service.  Sushi is not a fast food offering and nobody should expect it to be.  Enjoy it in the same way you would pour time over an aged steak from Mastros.  Most great things in life are slow and savored."}
{"text":"We have been to this place 3 times in the last year, and each time it gets worse. Our recent visit took almost 2 hours and all we ordered was four sushi rolls. From the servers to the kitchen, they just don't have enough people working here. Very slow getting all the food and drinks. Since most of food served here is uncooked, it should't take this long to get a sushi roll. It took a half an hour just to get our bottle of wine, then the server just dropped it off without opening it. I guess she thought that I brought my own corkscrew. The wine list is a joke too. Choice of 4 whites or 4 reds. The owners here are clueless, and to put it bluntly, idiots. They have no business running a restaurant. I don't know how long they will stay open operating this way. We will never be back. Not just the worst sushi restaurant I've been to, but one of the worst places ever!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at Blu. The sushi is delicious and the options are endless. I love their happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Chef Richard really sets out to make your dining experience inclusive and memorable well at least that's how we felt during our visit. Granted, the place wasn't busy so chatting it up with the chef and our sweet server made our visit warm and inclusive. We felt like we were having our own personal chefs table/sushi bar  experience ha! 
Just to mention a few favs the Sea bream or Kurodai was on the daily specials menu and we really enjoyed the buttery and light sashimi cuts with fresh wasabi ( always preferred over wasabi paste) Also my favorite was the akami cuts of blue fin tuna so firm and fresh! 
Salmon and red snapper also high quality and generously cut. 
A five star all around for BluShushi YUM!"}
{"text":"Really happy to have this place in the area.  Great sushi at a decent price.  Their lunch and happy hour menus offer really great values.  Service can be a little inconsistent at times, but not to the extent of being a deal breaker.  Kitchen times, such as Yaki Soba and bento boxes are equally delicious."}
{"text":"The service was awful.  When we got there we were only 2 of 3 customers and took forever to come take our order.  

After 45 minutes had passed came with one of our orders and it was wrong.  Then had to wait again for miso soup 
Never brought out our appetizer of poke we ordered.  

After over an hour we finally got our order!  
Very bad experience and will not be returning.  Even though the sushi may have been decent the experience made it bad and I couldn't wait to just leave. 

And to top it off did not offer to take anything off the price after the terrible service."}
{"text":"Place is awesome, some of the best sushi I have had , very friendly service.. will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Nagiri Sushi Platter was delicious and filling. Rolls are good size and big enough to share between couple of people. Happy hour is excellent with appetizers at half off. Atmosphere was chill with good vibes. Service was fast and professional. Will be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot! With my office just across Pima I was thrilled when Blu Sushi opened. I've had lunch twice and both times I've been very pleased with the quality and value of my meal! Jeny is such a sweetheart and is sure to keep my drink full and make sure everything is perfect."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of sushi all over the country and I would have to say this is some of the better sushi I have had! I would highly recommend this place! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time and was very pleased. We had the Blu Platter with Teryk Chicken and the Spicy Tuna roll, Rainbow roll and the Geisha roll. All the food was great the Blu special and Geisha roll was fantastic. Would come again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients, good value. The yellowtail sashimi was one of the best cuts we've had. It was like butter; you could eat it without teeth. The Tsuyu ramen came in a delicate homemade broth.   The yellowtail Kama (jawbone) was tender and juicy. Service was helpful and friendly. Atmosphere was down to earth. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First visit to Blu Sushi after a friend's recommendation. This is the best SUSHI I've tasted in Phoenix metropolitan!  I moved to AZ from the Bay Area. After San Francisco's excellent Sushi I could not find any that compares in AZ until I ate here. Fresh fresh melt in your mouth fish served with excellent sauces and a good flair. Spicy rolls are rated on the menu with 1 pepper for mildly spicy up to 3 peppers for the spiciest. Owners are friendly and give excellent service. They even gave us an extra baked roll in the house! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, thin cuts of salmon and hamachi. Rolls are extremely heavy on rice and light on fish and vegetables.realy poor experience for us om May 25, 2017."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Sushi lovers come and be amazed. The freshness is only beaten by the incredible sushi chef, Richard. Your stomach and mouth are in for a treat. Let Jeannie make you a cocktail to wash everything down smoothly."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had in the valley! Food, service, menu options, and presentation is the highest of quality. No person will ever leave this place dissatisfied! I recommend it to every person I know, and even if you don't live in Scottsdale, this place is worth the drive! The sushi chef is extremely talented and always has a special item posted and the owner and staff are absolutely incredible. I plan on visiting this place as often as possible and all other sushi restaurants are out of the picture after eating here!"}
{"text":"Went to blu sushi for lunch and it was the best sushi I've had in a really long time! Their sushi rolls are a great size and NOT itty bitty like most places nowadays and their prices during lunch time are practically a steal! Highly suggest checking this place out!!"}
{"text":"Friends told us to go to Pure Sushi, but this was next to the grocery store so we went here instead.  Mistake. The blue string lights, strip mall setting, and fact that there was only one other table of guests should have given it away.

Service was okay (remember, us and one other table), prices not bad.  But we ordered (among other things), the blue plate which supposedly featured 20 pieces of the freshest selection.  It came with 18 -- not fatal, perhaps the sushi chef cut a finger off and could only count to nine. But several of those pieces were old, dried out, and the crab was fake crab.  Really?  Fake crab in your top 20?  

We have since been to Pure Sushi.  Hands down, no question, go to Pure Sushi."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals. The amigo roll was my favorite. If you like fresh jalapeño then give it a try. The tuna roll was also delicious and the cocktails were made with fresh fruit. Small quiet setting with tv's at the bar. Service is friendly and fast. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Literally the best sushi in town. My husband and I go to this amazing restaurant weekly and it is to die for. The sashimi is delicious and so fresh and they have such incredible rolls as well. The service is also impeccable I highly recommend checking this restaurant out, you will be so so glad you did."}
{"text":"Ordered tako salad, two uni sushi and chirashi bowl. Best sushi I have ever had. Excellent."}
{"text":"Another awesome meal at Blue Sushi; went to celebrate my daughter's university acceptance.  I don't even look at the menu anymore.  I just talk with the staff and let them choose.  We splurged on the super fresh Bluefin Toro that was spectacular,  The special rolls for the day included a King and I roll that had a spicy Thai finish; super yummy.

This is now our GOTO sushi joint."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a timing issue, but they do open at 11:00am. My wife and I arrived for lunch at 11:30am to find a half dozen tables occupied but no one being served. Appeared that only the bartender was there. We were in a hurry and based on the number of people in front of us who hadn't be helped we decided to go elsewhere.

Bad service is a killer. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I was out riding my bicycle and looking for something to eat, when I came upon this hidden gem. At first I rode past because there wasn't anyone in there, but not finding anything else, I decided to give it a try. I sat outside at the bar and was immediately greeted by a young man named Min. He's from LA but has an accent reminiscent of someone from New Orleans. Seeing that I was parched from my ride, he immediately got me a large glass of water, followed by a cold pint of Sapporo beer. He casually asked if I'd like to try an excellent appetizer. I said 'sure, what is it?' to which he replied 'fish and chips.' Well it couldn't have been farther from what I had in mind. What a fantastic recommendation! My dinner consisted of maguro (tuna) and unagi (fresh water eel) nigiri sushi, as well as Min's recommended roll, the Fire Roll. I had was served the nigiri first and it was a perfect balance of fish to rice. The unagi was the best I've had in a very long time. When the Fire Roll arrived, it was wrapped in aluminum foil and set ablaze. Once opened, the smokey aroma was incredible. One the first piece, I knew immediately that this was the best roll I'd ever eaten. There aren't words to describe it, but I'll just say 'off the hook.' The owner, Jeannie hung out and chatted with me throughout my meal and just speaking with her, I can see her passion for serving good food. If you haven't tried Blu Sushi, you've missed out. Go, eat, be amazed. Quite possibly the best sushi I've had the pleasure of eating."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday around 6pm ..not busy - probably picks up later . Dining space outside and bar area that transitions to the outside . Service was great - always refilling drinks . Didn't get any alcoholic drinks but the bartender seemed like quite the mixologist for the people at the bar .

Had the Hawaiian, Aloha and BSCR baked roll ..all delicious. Also had a sushi \"burrito\" wrapped in lettuce -very very good . Had an edamame bowl as an appetizer-finally I've had a good dish of edamame- lightly salted , just perfect ! 

This place seems like a hidden treasure- go now before there's a long wait !"}
{"text":"Great food for the entire family. Sushi was fresh and had very different flavors. The teriyaki chicken for my youngest son was delicious. The lunch specials were very reasonable."}
{"text":"So glad I have found a good Sushi place in N Scottsdale!  Try the Blazing Shrimp made with shrimp tempura, cream cheese and crispy fried Jalapeños.  A nice sleek and clean seating area with a beyond friendly staff make this great choice!"}
{"text":"My mom & I can in for happy hour and let me tell you something, what a deal they have going on there!!! Basically we got 7 rolls, 3 appetizers and a bomber beer all for $74.00!!!! I know right!?!?! Crazy cheap!!! The owner was making our sushi personally and she was a sweet heart and our server was awesome! She always made sure we had everything we needed! By the way get the blazing shrimp roll it's to die for. No it's not on the HH menu but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! We love finding small amazing places when we travel and this one didn't disappoint. The fish was fresh and the presentation was excellent. The chef went out of his way for us and accommodated all requests for someone in our party with an allergy. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone. The owner is very kind and solicitous and Rafael, our server, was on the ball the whole time."}
{"text":"Disappointed.. the sushi was good but very small & expensive. I am still searching for the perfect sushi place. It's of moving from Expensive Orange County CA. & It's more expensive out here?
The service was good (only customer) but the waitress was attentive, pleasant & friendly.
I don't mind spending money for sushi but I feel a little disappointed when the amount of sushi included in the roll of less than the cream cheese or other tasty fillers. 
 Oh well the search continues..."}
{"text":"So sad that this place is going down and out. They won't be in business next year barring a miraculous turnaround. I've been here several times and this time was a big disappointment.

The fish is fresh, but sadly, the good ends there now. The service is horrific. Insufficient staff can't carry the seating load. You will never have quality service if you don't have sufficient staff, as sincere as the skeleton crew may be. Our server bungled the order twice, and simply getting the correct salads to the table was a challenge. At one point, the sushi chef wandered about attempting to locate the table that ordered the salads. Then they came back with someone else's salads. The second time, the nigiri sushi platter was replaced by a sashimi platter which made the waitress red (embarrassed). When she returned with the correct platter, the \"chef's best selection\", it included cocktail shrimp, ordinary tuna, salmon, and wahoo. Basically, they bungled an order and attempted to recuperate their losses using the least expensive fish they had. The platter was $60. This might have been the most insulting part of the evening.

Drinking sake? Beware! They don't advertise prices and innocently present a simple bottle of sake for one, only to charge you $40 later. They have prices for wine, but not for sake which is curious. That said, ask before you buy.

Slow service, deceptive pricing, aggressive salesmanship by the wait staff, and lack of integrity will not bring me or my party back to this establishment.

Sorry, but after two bad visits, you Blu it. Two stars for quality fish."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi every time!  Two thumbs up!! PS. The lemon roll is fantastic. The Baja sauce (a Japanese pesto)... Richard's secret sauce, IS FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"BOMBEST Sushi I have had in a while. We had the slick roll, the baked lobster tail, baked salmon, inferno and fire roll. (Practically had the menu)

Everything was fresh - to death. I mean it .

You will not leave this place disappointed or hungry."}
{"text":"Ok. I've had sushi all over the world, including Japan. This place is absolutely in my Top 3! Try the Beautiful Blue, amazing! The freshest fish in AZ! Highly recommend. Oh and very fair prices!!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food is top notch!   Having lived in north Scottsdale for 20 years we have tried most of the sushi places in the area.  This is definitively our favorite."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi fan and Blu Sushi delivers! Their creativity with their sushi is remarkable. Blu Sushi is located in the AJ's shopping center and it's a hidden gem for sure!

Whenever I hit up Blu Sushi I start with their garlic edemame and their miso soup. Their miso soup is rich and full of flavor. 

Sushi roll must try here at Blu Sushi: Cherry Blossom! It's so good!!

They have a great happy hour menu but take note that they are closed on Sunday. 

Their martinis are also really good! They have some really unique beverages that are must tries."}
{"text":"Was not disappointed at all. The sushi was fresh and delicious. The place was clean and had a great atmosphere . Our waitress was very nice and attentive . We also had Chicken Teriyaki and Veggie Fried Rice all were good. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and they accepted my little puppy (we cant leave her alone in the hotel room)."}
{"text":"We just love this place.  Drinks are fabulous and various sushi's are so fresh and creative.  We live in Chicago and do 3 months out here and this is the only place we go when we want Sushi.  Ginny remembers us from a whole year ago and greets us with hugs and remembers my favorite drink. Come, sit at the Sushi bar, watch some sports and order up a great meal."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and super nice service. Casual atmosphere. The garlic edamame was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The sushi was fantastic, fresh prepared well and very tasty. All around great place from the decorating to the service. I would absolutely go back again."}
{"text":"I dislike writing negative reviews, but feel I must say something about the terrible service at Blu Sushi last night.  In quick summary, the food was OK, the ambiance fine (it's a strip-mall restaurant), the supporting staff friendly, but our server was categorically awful.  She got just four of the seven items we ordered correct, promised to fix it on the bill, then gave us a bill for the entire incorrect order.  Her delivery was ridiculously slow on what was not a busy night in the restaurant, and the food simply wasn't good enough to overcome the inattentive and incompetent service.  Unfortunately, it ruined Blu for us and I cannot recommend it to anyone who loves sushi--even in a quick and casual style."}
{"text":"Awesome, best service, food is beyond reproach!  Love it - see for yourself come on in!"}
{"text":"On my most recent visit, the quality and freshness of the sushi rice was not as good as my previous visits. The rice was mushy and tasted old. Service was great but the quality of the rolls I ordered did not meed my expectations."}
{"text":"I'd never had sushi outside of my small, Missouri college town until last night. I recently moved to the area for an internship and had been craving sushi for a while. One of my co-workers recommended Blu Sushi and she did not lead me astray. The employees were very friendly, kind and attentive. I ordered a Sapporo Roll. It was not as spicy as I would have hoped but still fantastic! It had one chili for spiciness so next time I may try something with more kick. They have a huge sushi selection which intrigues me to come back for more. The only thing I was disappointed with was the dessert I ordered. I requested the Oreo Cheesecake. It was clear that the cheesecake had been frozen and was not flawed completely. Plating was beautiful, however. I would probably skip the dessert next time, but I will definitely be going back for sushi again."}
{"text":"Have been here four times. Always friendly & great service. The fish is perfect!  We will continue to frequent!  Good location for us.
We continue to frequent & really enjoy it. Food is top notch. Service is great. Overall a great experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here twice when we were here a year ago.  Sushi was very very good ((I've spent a few months in Japan being wined and dined) but even better, the owner & staff are super - both friendly and helpful - When we arrived here tonight they remembered us and remembered what we drank and what we ate!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Blu Sushi! Our new favorite sushi place! The owner is friendly and we love the casual space."}
{"text":"From Chicago and was looking for a place for my moms birthday in Scottsdale and was impressed not only by the food but the service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I am not familiar with the Scottsdale area and this seemed to me to be in the middle of nowhere but boy was it worth it! We ordered an assortment of things several different roles and chicken fried rice. Every single item we ordered was impeccably prepared and tasted perfect! I am from San Diego and generally do not find the sushi in Arizona very good but this could easily hold its own with anything I've ever had in California. Add to that that the staff was phenomenal the place was not very busy and when I first walked up the outside area made me think it might be a bar but once you get inside it's a very cute little restaurant and the waitress and the owner or manager I'm not quite sure which, are all absolutely wonderful! I asked a lot of questions about the food and they were very accommodating. This will definitely beone of my go to spots!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. $10 lunch specials where the food keeps coming out.. Like.. Seriously.. 4 course meal time. Soup. Salad. Sushi. Protein.  Side dish.  The best part - it's ALL delicious!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi place. Friendly service and decent sushi. There are better spots, but this one isn't terrible."}
{"text":"Finally, a sushi place has opened in Far North Scottsdale. My friend and me were so excited to try it and were practically there the day they opened; it has become our favorite sushi place. The sushi is always so fresh and delicious. The owner is friendly and welcoming.  Not only that, they have a generous happy hour menu. This restaurant is also spotless, even the bathroom,  which is a sign of how well a restaurant is run. I always enjoy coming here and I recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! A sushi place in AZ that reminds me of the great sushi that you can find in San Francisco or Hawaii. This is NOT your typical crappy deep fried and low grade fish sushi restaurant you find in AZ. I had eaten here for the first time this week and the sushi was amazing. They actually had Toro.....and this wasn't the laughable Toro you normally get in AZ....it was Oh-Toro...which is basically the best type of fish you can eat. If you haven't eaten here....and you truly can appreciate GOOD sushi....you're missing out if you haven't given this place a chance. Next time....I'm taking pics!!!"}
{"text":"Innovative, delicious sushi rolls! Creative, yummy appetizers! Japanese burrito...a must try! Come on in and be treated like family. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was dead on a Friday night.  The sushi was just a-ok.  We wanted to order the toro and since it was listed as market price, we asked our server how much it would cost.  She told us \"no more than $20\".  So we shrugged our shoulders, said, not bad...let's try it!  We ordered 2 orders of the toro.  When it came time for our bill to arrive, she was completely wrong!  It was $40 EACH for it!  When we asked her about it, she responded, \"I wrong.\"  Ughhhh."}
