{"text":"Was happy to see a Hawaiian BBQ place within walking distance of my home. I had the short ribs and thought it was cooked to perfection. The taste was excellent and it was served in a timely manner. Will definitely be coming back to LULU."}
{"text":"Such a good selection of food, ordered delivery. My husband was shocked by the generous amount of food he got for a $10 plate. I ordered a mini loco moco, reminded me of the all the good food back home in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Food quality: It's actually pretty good! I usually get the mix plate with chicken katsu & bbq beef, no salad just extra rice. Try their molasadas when it's fresh, it's delicious. 

Price: Items are priced reasonably & I believe military gets 10% off. 

Cleanliness & Staff: It's a brand new restaurant so it's nice & clean. I especially like that you can actually see the kitchen! The tables are always wiped down as soon as customers leave & I like that you are greeted immediately when you come in!

**They also deliver which I love!"}
{"text":"The highly anticipated opening of Lulu is upon us! No shade toward L&L but so glad my Hawaiian food cravings are only a hop, skip and a jump away. I've had the grilled chicken,  bbq beef and katsu...all are bomb.com! Mac salad was hmm hmm hmm. Extra katsu and teriyaki ready for you to grab to your heart's content. Very clean & inviting open kitchen with very good handling habits. Friendly manager and cashier who haven't had a day off since opening I think!  Welcome to Centennial!"}
{"text":"We ordered here 2 nights ago. I was not going to do this.  But my entire family has had diarrhea for 2 days after taking a few bites before we all collectively tossed out this gross, old, chewy, slimy food. Never in my life have I eaten something I wondered to myself \"how old is this?\" As I sit on the toilet filling it with liquid lava, aching with a fever, sweating and cramping like crazy and listening to my children crying in pain fighting over the upstairs bathroom going through the same thing... I'm appalled this place is allowed to serve food. Never will I order here again!! I know you are sick of the same old stuff on eat 24 and you are curious about the Hawaiian BBQ. After filling a toilet a hundred times and having to venture out twice to buy more toilet paper in this condition let me advice you to skip this place all together! Do not eat from here!"}
{"text":"BBQ chicken was amazing as well as the rice and macaroni salad. Definitely like the amount of chicken they give you and very clean. I really recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is great and the portion sizes are very generous. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant and bathroom are always clean."}
{"text":"Great new Hawaiian spot in Centennial hills. They have all the staple food items, and also have delivery options for those in the area. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that their Katsu is rather thin--Very little meat, lots of breading. Overall, they offer big portions and this place hits the spot when you get those Hawaiian food cravings."}
{"text":"Got chicken katsu and a spam masubi. Good flavor all around. Struggled to find a piece of katsu with chicken larger than a few pieces of paper thick. At least the fried part on the outside didn't overwhelm the amount of chicken in it."}
{"text":"When I saw the signage go up for LULU's, I could not wait for them to open.  As I was recently searching the yelp app, I noticed it was up and running.  I ended up there Friday night ready to make my order.

Located in an already insane parking lot due to other business's, you would do well to just park out in the north forty and walk in.  There is ample seating inside but not really for a Friday night.  I was on a mission to order and hoped that it would travel well enough to the house to be devoured.  

There was a lull in the action when I walked in shortly after 6:00PM.  I scanned the multiple menus posted about and experienced my normal pre-order vertigo followed up with indecision.  This was quickly cured when I spotted a handheld menu.

I ordered for the GF a mini Loco Moco.  For myself, I ordered up a regular Chicken Katsu and a Spam Musubi.  The staff was friendly and I sat down to wait.  The next swell of hungry humans came in and it got busy quick.  I sat back and watched to see how this new location handled the pressure.  Everyone was all smiles and remained just as friendly as when I arrived.

My order was up in quick fashion and out the door I went.  Out I went back to my sled watching the insane parking lot do it's thing.

When I arrived at the casa, I quickly tore into the bag and set the table.  There was some condensation (anyone figure out a cure for this and you'll be a millionaire!) but not enough  to ruin the delicious crunch of my Katsu. The regular size was awesome and served with a two huge helping of rice and da mac on the side.  The mac had a wonderful flavor to it.  I will order extra next time. I was so engaged with my meal that sadly I did not try any of Loco.  The musubi, as I had previously observed was made to order and was also delicious.

LULU, I am thrilled you are in the area and I look forward to visiting you again....even if my waist size isn't."}
{"text":"The food is ok, prices are good, the teriyaki sauce is not good, to me L&L is better. I do love the egg rolls here they are so good."}
{"text":"Got pick up. Food was quick and service was friendly and tasty as usual. The have their ups and downs. Today was an up!"}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, we have high expectations when it comes to hawaiian BBQ as we know how it SHOULD taste. The food was great, service was awesome, beautiful environment, they'll have a lot of walk in traffic. 

A few tips for the owner: you can tell when food has been marinated & I would marinate a bit longer or make your marinade a bit more concentrated. It lacked flavor by just a little (BBQ chicken, teriyaki beef, BBQ short ribs). Typically, hawaiian bbq also has a char on the food, so I would sear the BBQ short ribs a bit longer / turn up the heat because it ALWAYS tastes better when it has char! :)"}
{"text":"When I walked in and noticed the sign \"What is Boba??\" I knew I was in trouble. 

Express style resteraunt, very clean and well decorated. Bright and comfortable. The employees were all very friendly however the feeling of being at L&L was a little over whelming. 

The portions are very good for the price but the taste and texture of the food left a little to be desired.

 It's a good spot if you are just lookin for a fast, big portion at a good price."}
{"text":"My husband and I order delivery from here at least once a week - always a fast, fresh, and friendly experience. BBQ mix plate is delish and hubby loves to get chicken katsu. I do wish the chicken had less fat pieces, but i can get over it. Saimin on a cold day hits the spot. So glad this opened up close to home. Better than L&L, in our opinion."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Got the Katsu and BBQ chicken! Chicken was tender and came out piping hot! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So greasy. Teriyaki meal are not supposed to that greasy.and meat needed to cook way longer than what i got.i had combo plate chicken had skin on they dont cut the meat like other Hawaiian places.their restaurant called Hawaiian but it taest like gready Chinese food.totally grossed out"}
{"text":"This is almost a 4. I'm just on the fence. I prefer L&L when they don't give you extremely thin overly fried katsu. But here's the details to this place. Ordered at the inside and the girl working talked barely louder than a whisper. Place was clean and new. Spam masubi, you can't mess this up. I also ordered the crab ragoon, and the sauce was WAY too fishy. It left a disgusting aftertast, idk if they make it in house but they need to tone down the fish sauce. I Also ordered delivery. It took about 30 min from calling in. Food was still hot when delivered. I ordered the chicken katsu this time. Sauce was similar to L&L. The chicken was juicy and thick, but I do wish it was a little crisper as it got soggy near the end. The rice is not like L&L because it is more moist vs. The drier rice, either one isn't bad, but just a difference. Now I love L&L macaroni salad but this place.... the mac salad had way too much mayo. The Flavor Was good. But they should tone down the mayo as it was just grossly dressed. I'll probably come back, but I think I may prefer L&L even though L&L is totally hit or miss lately"}
{"text":"Having been to Lulus on Decatur. I was excited for this restaurant to open. Place is nice and clean and friendly service as well. But my wife ordered me the bbq chicken plate last night and it tasted like it was not even marinated it was missing the flavor I normally enjoy. It tasted just like plain chicken. I had to add sauce and siracha to get some type of flavor. Sad to say will probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I wish they would make their rice scoop a little more because we always end up buying extra scoop of rice for our boys and their macaroni salad is a little bland not like other Hawaiian BBQ place, at least add more carrots. Good portion of food, just add a little more rice please."}
{"text":"My first time ordering from here and first time ordering them as delivery. Let me tell you, the delivery service is so fast! The food is awesome! It's hard to find delivery for something other than pizza and Chinese food. Lulu's is my choice for delivery now!"}
{"text":"This is The Worse Fucking excuse of a so called restaurant! I went in to order. The reason why I should of ran for the hills is when I asked that girl behind the counter what kind of soup do you have? I felt like a Professor at UNLV,giving me the deer in head light look she then turned to the other Lil girl. Some man was back there too looking hella lost!!!!! After explaining to the bitch what soup is I then ordered my selection of soup. I then asked for combinations 57 And 67. After paying I thought the price should have been a lil higher. Paying with my debit card I asked for change so I could tip her ass with cash. After waiting which seemed forever I then found that the lil girl has a math problem as well. Instead of the three items I thought I paid for. I received only two item. If you have time go teach English and order your food then by all means go in and order. Please remember your math skills on the way in as well!!! The whole experience was horrible solely because my father is 84 year old diabetic so I ended up rushing to Raising Canes to order from a place that would be able to get the correct order since father had took his insulin shot. No more whole in the wall joints for us!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummmy, hits the spot when ur starved and don't wanna cook yet want some Hawaiian style COMFORT food .  The wonton soup with noodles is sooo good and plain, not over spiced and yummmm tasty short ribs!!!  Mac salad is killer as well .... Overall good quality and super nice workers.  All Ono.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is not bad for the price. It definitely has some positive food tastes.

I had the salmon steaks. I was given two pieces of salmon which I thought was generous for $8.95. They were overcooked but still tasted good. I did have to use both lemon wedges to make it moist enough to enjoy. 

I had some of the garlic shrimp as well, but it had very little if any garlic taste. The tempura was good and the shrimp were tender. The macaroni salad was bland. 

The best dish I tasted was the hot and spicy chicken. It was extremely flavorful. If you visit this place order this. 

It is not bad for the price point."}
{"text":"I've had Lulu's at another location and did not like it. This one was new so I thought I'd give it a chance. Not good either. :("}
{"text":"Really like this place. I'll probably be coming here more often since it's down the street from me."}
{"text":"The young Chinese girl the cashier is RUDE. Asked a simple question if I can substitute the bbq chicken with chicken Katsu. She looked at me like I was stupid and answered back with attitude NO. Sitting there eating our food and she never checked up on us if we were ok but she checked up on other people in the restaurant. Gave the other people their bill with fortune cookies and she came to give us our bill and my son said how come we didn't get fortune cookies. My son got up himself and grabbed it SMH. I will stick to L & L Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"Delicious musubis!!! Love all the musubi variations they offer beyond spam. My go to order is the mini chicken katsu meal with spam musubi and a pork bun. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Definitely better than L&L BBQ on this side of the valley. I ordered the garlic shrimp but was disappointed that it came with shrimp tempura instead. There are not a lot of places up at Centennial Hills to get Hawaiian food. As a Hawaiian Ohana now living up here in Vegas, we are satisfied with how the food turned out."}
{"text":"Honey chicken katsu, BBQ beef, chicken lumpia, fried wontons and a piece of the fried shrimp from my man's seafood combo. All of that was really good. The macaroni salad is bland and boring, it literally has no flavor. The fish from his plate was \"meh\" nothing special. Everything else was really good! I asked for a LOT of soy sauce and they gave me 3 packets. Really? I ordered and picked up, it was ready in 10 minutes. I will be ordering again but won't order the fish... and hopefully by then they will have fixed the mac salad... at least salt it!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from lulu2, and I've ordered Kalua pork, the mixed BBQ plate and the garlic shrimps. I have to say, they do deliver hella fast!! It took them less than 30 mins from ordering online to actually delivering the food!!!! 
The BBQ plate was really good, it got grilled chicken, some kalbi and I believe some BBQ beef. The Kalua pork is pretty good but they need to give out more cabbage. And for the garlic shrimps, I just don't care for it, i just didn't like the taste, not garlicky enough for me.

But..... fast delivery of Hawaiian food!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place via delivery on our lazy Sunday evening. They arrived sooner than they stated, so that was good.  Hawaiian food is not the best, but everything we got was ok. It's nice we now have a Hawaiian place close by and that delivers."}
{"text":"excellent food. you get what u expect. typical hawaiian food with huge portions. favorite part is that have extra katsu sauce available without charging extra. will be my new hawaiian joint and look forward to trying all the other menu items."}
{"text":"I was excited that they opened another Hawaiian BBQ joint not far from where I live besides L&L BBQ. I called to make the order, and the man that took my order was very friendly, and said that the order would be ready in 10 minutes. I thought 10 minutes was a short amount of time to prepare food unless you go to a fast food restaurant. I ordered the seafood platter and the food was disgusting. The fish was rubbery, and the scallops didn't taste like scallops. The food was lacking flavor big time! I didn't even finish my plate. My stomach was hurting after I ate the food too! No bueno! Too many other restaurants to choose from, so I will never return. Only gave two stars instead of one, because they were really nice, other than that, the food was two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"He prefers L&Ls, but he will settle for LULU as well.  This is a great little place.  The food is always pretty good and we haven't had a bad experience here yet.  The people the work there are very quick and organized.  I'm so glad that we have a very close Hawaiian BBQ spot near us now.  

Some of these places can be a little dingy and dirty feeling (greasy -anyone else feel like that?). This is not one of those places. It's very clean and new -maybe because it is new. It just makes me feel better about the food that I recieve from a location when it looks a lot cleaner.  Does that make any sense whatsoever? This is our spot to go to in the NW and we'ver very happy that it is here.  This is on our list of places to go to for take away if we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. Location is very clean including restroom. How ever the Loco moco was not fresh today. It was like a frozen patty fried, a little rubbery also. Drenched in gravy. It was a large portion,  over a bed of white rice. They forgot the mac salad for my plate. Flavor was very bland. I fixed with shoyu,  teriyaki sauce, and Sriracha provided.i tasted the saimin with spam and the soup base was also very bland, tasted mostly hot water. How ever the banana lumpia was good. Small portion but good flavor , sweet and the lumpia wrapping was very crunchy. I will try this place again to see if the experience will be different."}
{"text":"One of best places to eat good food good service the ribs was awesome will come back and recommend this place to anyone thank you............"}
{"text":"Great little spot tucked away in the Montecito Shopping Center. Definitely my local go to when the roommate and I are craving Spam Musubi.

The place itself is small. You walk in to a few tables and the same friendly guy greeting you every day you come in no matter the time of day. 

Like I said, this is my go to place for musubi and it doesn't disappoint. Usually I stick to the classic spam but there's other musubi options like Portuguese sausage and chicken katsu.

I normally get their very filling and affordably priced combination platters. These combo plates all come with 2 scoops of rice, cabbage and a scoop of macaroni salad and 2 to 3 sides of protein depending on what you choose. Fried shrimp,  scallops, fried fish, short ribs, BBQ beef or BBQ chicken are all choices. You really can't go wrong with any of the many choices."}
{"text":"Delivery is quick! The steamed pork bun (Manapua) is a touch dry. Banana lumpia is sweet- make sure you like banana! The chicken lumpia is good. Of course I am partial to my Aunt's, she uses a bit more vegetable and closes her ends. The seaweed salad was great per my husband's review- he said it was flavorful like a tasty piece of the ocean. We also had the kalua pork, rice and Lau Lau. Very good flavor, a nice gentle smoke on the Kalua."}
{"text":"This is fairly new close by our home & we do enjoy Hawaiian, so we get it a try. Service is good, very attentive. We ordered loco moco & chicken katsu. Both came with white rice & a side of macaroni salad. They were both just ok. Hamburger patties were thin & nothing special, brown gravy was good though. Chicken Katsu was a little dry, the sauce was good. Both were big portions! We might try it one more time but something different."}
{"text":"This restaurant, if you even want to call it that, gave me the worst dining experience I've ever had. As I received my food and was about to indulge, one of the employees essentially kicked me out of the establishment because they were about to close. My meal was slapped together carelessly in seconds lacking flavor, and the beef had an unappetizing texture. I told myself I never wanted to come back. I would not recommend this Hawaiian BBQ restaurant to anybody that I do not hate. Teriyaki madness is way better despite being a larger food chain. Don't waste your time, money, or emotions."}
{"text":"Smelled just like home. Ordered takeout and they were nice enough to bring it to our table where we were waiting at. Service was quick. I got a mini chicken katsu and the portion was huge! I swear there were 3 layers of chicken katsu. A mini with 2 katsu sauces is more than enough for one person. I liked that they put the mac salad into a separate container. Their mac salad is better than Babystacks.

They included a menu into our bag. They deliver up to 4 miles for an extra $2.

Can't wait to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Bland, tasteless food. The saimin is close to cup of noodles type quality.

Really disappointed since there isn't any Hawaiian food aside from L&L. Uses Kraft Mayo for the Mac salad which is a cardinal sin of Hawaiian cooking."}
{"text":"Food was spot on and the customer service was great. The server was very attentive and offered options. I ordered the katsu and a spam musubi, and family ordered beef terriyaki. Enjoyed this place I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Solid 3 1/2 stars!

Besides L&L in the NW part of town, now we have another option...LULU Hawaiian BBQ!  Food fairly similar between all Hawaiian BBQs...but to be honest, none of them compare to back home in Hawaii!  This LULU, while a step in the right direction, is just OK.

Décor is almost the same as Ohana Hawaiian BBQ, the huge lit up menu boards too!  Like all of them, the Hawaiian menu is basically 95% the same as the other Hawaiian BBQ restaurants here too.  Funny, same employees too....pretty much all Chinese!  No offense to y'all...but where is the locals atmosphere, eh?  Not one local Hawaii worker in sight!  No pidgin English!  No IZ or Kapena or Pati or 3 Plus playing on the stereo!!  Ack, for me this almost automatically takes a star away!  It's a part of the ambiance!  The locals make it like home!

Back to the food though, which is very much on par with all the other non-Hawaiian owned Hawaiian BBQ places in all of Las Vegas.  Cooked efficiently, tastes really (really) just A-OK.  There is something missing for me, I don't know.  Is it the love?  Something is lacking.  The food will feed you for sure with its large portions, and while pretty tasty - I just don't feel NOURISHED.  Perhaps it's a soul thing?  Anyway, the family and I partook in:

-Fried Fish Combo Plate
-Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate (BBQ Chicken, Beef & Kalbi)
-Chicken Katsu Curry Combo Plate

Each combo plate comes with 2 scoops of rice & 1 scoop of macaroni salad.  If you're going low carb, get the mini plate!  2 scoops of rice is massive!  But yummy with extra shoyu.  Macaroni salad for me is delicious with a dose of black pepper & Tabasco.  LULU's macaroni salad was a tad runny for me though and could have used more salt.

Entrees itself were average, nothing fancy to write home about.  Fried fish seemed like more batter than fish.  Chicken katsu was ehhhhh...the chicken was pounded way too thin in certain sections so you got a lot more panko than meat.  The curry on the chicken katsu was for sure from a can/bag too...artificial tasting.  If you're gonna do that at least use a GOOD brand!  I normally don't like the katsu sauce served in any of these restaurants too, usually a cheap mix of ketchup & Worcestershire sauce.  If I know ahead of time I'm visiting a Hawaiian BBQ here, I bring my own!!  Bulldog or Kikkoman Katsu Sauce does the trick just fine!

Best thing we ate was probably the Hawaiian BBQ mix plate.  The chicken, beef & kalbi were grilled very well on the flat top - good sear with those tasty caramelized edges.  Great with hot white rice.  I would order this the next time if we come back.  Generous serving - except that we got only 1 piece of kalbi.  More kalbi ribs, less BBQ chicken!  I insist!

Not a bad experience overall at LULU Hawaiian BBQ.  We may be back again the next time a local food craving kicks in.  Maybe then I'll see a local Hawaiian working behind the counter!!

{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim today during my lunch hour. I was looking for something quick and wanted to switch up from my normal splurge of Greek food in the same shopping center. Enter LuLu Hawaiian BBQ 2. I already sort of knew what I wanted when I got up to the counter because I had browsed the menu in the past and it seems a lot like L&L(which I`m very familiar with). I ordered the BBQ chicken mini plate to go.

First impressions while waiting? The store was clean, the employees were friendly, and it was a nice warm temp in there(It is cold outside right now). I felt comfortable waiting, plus it smelled delicious in there. I waited about 8 minutes and one of the employees brought my to go bag to the table I was sitting at, which was nice.

When I got home, I ripped open the bag and popped the lid on that super familiar to go container and I was impressed by the amount of chicken I got. Plus, they separated out the cold macaroni so it didn`t get all gross in the styrofoam container with the hot chicken and rice. They also included napkins, cutlery, and a side of sweet soy sauce. Sweet. Now to taste.

Now this is where the experience falls apart for me(for ME. Everyone has their own taste standards). The rice was rice. It was fluffy and tasty with a little soy sauce. The macaroni, I`m sorry to say, while creamy...was incredibly bland. I kept digging, expecting the flavor to be released. I finished it, but I was definitely not impressed. In fact, I was a little sad after having had L&L macaroni in the past. I`m still slightly sad right now as I write this. I wanted to love that macaroni. Annnnnddddd ...the chicken. It was OK. There was rubbery skin on the underside, which was easy to peel away, but made for a less than desirable eating experience. I thought the flavor was fine, but lacking. I don`t know. The entire meal needed salt and a punch of something more. It was fine. Would I go back? Probably not unless someone really wanted to go and then I would say \"okay, dude\". 

Like I said, the employees were SO nice when I visited and I think the concept is good and we need more options up here in the NW, but the execution fell short."}
{"text":"Horrible. Fatty low quality meat. Lacking flavor too. Wee were needing a new go to place in the NW. This isn't it."}
{"text":"Ordered the mini Hawaiian BBQ chicken and banana lumpia. The banana lumpia was a small portion but very yummy! The mini chicken platter was the perfect size. The macaroni was bland, but I added mustard salt and pepper at home which made it perfect."}
{"text":"I have lived in Centennial Hills for a while now and there are no decent Hawaiian food places. Hawaiian barbecue is one of the coolest people I have some of the most incredible Hawaiian food you can get

I would highly recommend coming in here and trying any of the dishes because they are both inexpensive and tasty!"}
{"text":"Well, I was actually expecting Hawaiian BBQ, not cheap, frozen from the grocery store food. The only BBQ there was sauce in a bottle straight from a store. 
First and last time eating here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.


Great customer service they usually remember what you ordered if you come in more than once!


Place is very clean and well organized! 

Soda machine is always working!


Can't forget to mention they're the only place on this side of the town that has red bean sesame balls. Better than the Togo sushi section at Albertsons that's for sure!!


So glad I found this place! 

Check it out the Garlic shrimp is amazing!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hawaiian BBQ food. I saw the signage for this place quite a while ago and couldn't wait for it to open (I monitored the progress on a weekly basis!!). I was so excited there was going to be a kahlua pig place closer than the L&L over on Centennial. 

I'm sure I was probably one of their first customers. The dine-in area seemed clean and there are menus on the walls which are easy to use. The menu itself is extensive and I was boggled by all the choices. Not only do they have Hawaiian choices but also all the traditional Chinese food fare. 

I ordered what I had waited so long for, the kahlua pig. It comes in two sizes and both sizes include white rice and macaroni salad, which is the way it is traditionally served in other places. 

The kahlua pig had a nice flavor. Subtly smoky and not too salty. The meat was a tad dry which is somewhat common for this dish. I have only been to a handful of places where they kept their pork moist.   The scoops of rice were nice and fluffy, not the traditional sticky rice that usually comes with it and I liked the texture. The mac salad was the standard Hawaiian variety, which is normally over-dressed with mayonnaise and this was no different. I liked it better than some since it wasn't sweet as some mac salad is. The portions were ample and I usually order extra rice and extra mac salad and get three meals out of the pork serving. 

The only other thing I've tried so far was the egg rolls which were slightly greasy but tasted light and were pleasantly crunchy on the outside and moist and plump inside. 

All in all, I was satisfied. Love the location and I plan on taking away at least once a week. I'll be one of their regular customers."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's the new \"go to\" place, when looking for good inexpensive meals. The customer service is exceptional here with Jim & the crew. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazingly flavorful food. LuLu definitely edges out L&L with content, flavor, and quality good. I've eaten here about 12 times this month alone and the the 9.95 BBQ mixed plate its flawless. With the choice of 2 meats; BBQ chicken, beef, short ribs, Chicken Katsu, and shrimp you can't go wrong. 

Personally, my favorite order is the Katsu w/BBQ beef. Also the honey chicken Katsu misubi."}
{"text":"My parents warned me about this place. They told me it's not good. But of course I had to try for myself. And what do you know I'm not happy at all. I ordered the katsu chicken curry & BBQ beef/short ribs plate. Their food is very bland. There's nothing special about this place. The serving size was huge but what good is that if the food isn't tasty. I'm disappointed. All I wanted was a good dinner tonight instead I spent $20 on two plates that pretty much went to waste. At least now I know to avoid this place."}
{"text":"The food was hot, plentiful, and delicious. I had the food delivered to my home and everything was in the bag. Napkins, forks, and all the sauces that I could ever want. It really was a pretty good experience. Thank you Lulu's"}
{"text":"Probably the best so far I've tasted around Vegas. My favorite is the honey Katsu chicken, there mansala is great when you don't order big. The noodles siamin is worth the savory (simple but delicious). I order mostly online for delivery. They are amazing both delivery and in store services. I will continue to order here and will be my local hawaiian food restaurant. I am always satisfied to have them as my quick and fast food express when need a quick bite. Thank you for your amazing food and prices!"}
{"text":"Got the food delivered and it was quick but not crispy. Worse was that the driver forced me to tip. Never ordering again."}
{"text":"On a night where I had no intentions of leaving my house but was craving some Hawaiian BBQ, Yelp led me to LULU and I'm so glad it did. The food was delicious (aside from a couple fatty pieces that weren't edible)! I honestly wish I had had more room to eat because I couldn't finish the chicken lumpia which was wonderful :) And delivery was prompt, the driver courteous, and prices are very reasonable. I got a ton of food and a drink for the money I spent- including delivery charge, tax, and tip :) Overall, I enjoyed my first experience with LULU and will definitely keep it on my short list for future take-out orders."}
{"text":"A little courtesy could create a good impression. As we were entering the place, we were walking behind a guy but he just went on and did not even bother to hold the door for us. He turned out to be the owner or manager of the place."}
{"text":"I love me some Hawaiian food. Wound up here on accident and was not disappointed! Their rice was a bit subpar but their pork was on point!!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least 3 times and did one of their family meals as delivery once. Each time, the food was great! We did the family meal that says it feeds about 8 people, you definitely get more than expected! We fed 9 adults and still had left overs for 2 days."}
{"text":"I didn't like it, the taste was fine but you can get more delicious meals on other restaurants like L&L and Tiki's. I won't recommend the place."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and have ordered several items on the menu. The food is tasty but the portion sizes seem to be lacking in comparison to L&L down the street. The service has always been friendly and efficient. It's just hard to pay the same price for half the amount of food from their competition. The BBQ short ribs I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Very clean, very friendly staff. Food was made to order and didn't take very long to be made. We order two half and half combos which is served with rice and mac salad. I got fried rice, shorts ribs, and honey walnut shrimp. My bf ordered kalua pork & chicken katsu. It was cheaper than L&L or Makai. Nice that it's down the street from my house, they even cater or deliver! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim since we were craving Hawaiian food, but didn't really want to travel far. It's located in the Smith's shopping center on Durango and Elkhorn. 

It smelled like most fast food Hawaiian places, of cleaning products and food. But hey, at least it everything was very clean. We both order the seafood special plate that came with fried fish, fried shrimp and choice of meat. I got chicken katsu and hubby got bbq chicken. It also came with some macaroni salad and I ordered a side of kim chee. 

Overall everything was good, much better than I was expecting. I would say their prices are comparable to L&L and the katsu and bbq chicken being better at LuLu. Definitely a place I would go to again. The portions are generous that I was able to save my other half for lunch the next day."}

{"text":"The Hawaiian BBQ chicken is definitely Five stars! The decor is different and very nice! The menu has tons of options which is nice. Try the wontons!! They're so, so delicious! Fresh and crispy. Not oily! 
I'm really happy that we have a place like this across the street from our house!! No more driving to L&L. :-) 

I obviously can't try everything on the menu all at once so not much more to say!!! Come and try this place if this type of food is what you like!"}
