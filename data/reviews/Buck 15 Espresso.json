{"text":"Walked by while staying in the area for vacation. Decided to come in for a cup of coffee, and ended up getting some food as well. Both the food and drink were so good my friends and I came back every day. I highly recommend the jerked chicken grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The staff made us feel welcome and the food was great. The ricotta toast was beyond my expectations. 

This is the perfect place for a casual brunch for two since the seating is limited. There is one huge table where everyone sits + a few seats here and there near the window and the counter.  

The price was really fair."}
{"text":"Always such beautiful art at Buck 15, St. Henri"}
{"text":"Gotta give this place 5 stars. Interesting rotation of roasters being served. It's gone from Detour to a roaster in Toronto I didn't even know. Unfortunately, I didn't retain their name as it wasn't that catchy but it was quite good as a pour over. Curiously, they were also serving Stumptown the time I went most recently, for espresso drinks. I think that was just a temporary thing though. If anyone knows the name of the current TO roaster they're serving, I'd appreciate a PM about it! 

The menu looks really good as well, food-wise. I don't eat gluten so I haven't ordered anything but the plates always look great and ppl seem rly happy with the toast based offerings.

Staff is also very nice, place is clean and bright and located centrally relative to the metro system... what else can I say? there's wifi!"}
{"text":"The girls are super friendly and nice and the breakfast is just perfekt and super yummy!!! We really enjoyed it :-) go there!!!"}
{"text":"Attention to details (with food presentation, decor and all the way to the bathroom...did not mean to put this all in one sentence but oh well!). Modern minimalist artsy decor. Limited seating. Great coffee (says my better half). Try the Yummy smoked salmon bagel. High quality ingredients. Need more selection of teas (only 2 at time of review). A little on the pricey side but quality has a price I guess! That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Si vous cherchez un endroit où déjeuner près du marché Atwater et que vous n'avez pas le goût d'un plat cuisiné en série, rendez-vous ici. Le café est fabuleux et on nous offre de généreuses portions. J'ai craqué pour le bagel St-Viateur servi avec uf pour emporter, dans une charmante petit boîte, s'il vous plaît! Ne soyez toutefois pas trop pressés pour le service."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee shop. Great unique menu items, all are great breakfast options. The coffee is fresh and tastes delicious and the orange juice is fresh squeezed. The art in the place is good too. Good vibes."}
{"text":"Buck 15 is just mouth watering wonderful. Really.. It is!
Here's why. 
Overall It's a simple quite small place, that packs a great punch of originality, comfort and most of all flavour in each of their dishes. Each bite is a bite of comfort food, happyness and just perfection, also healthy. No no, don't let that turn you off. They are healthy in the sense of having great amounts of veggies, healthy meats, and not overly greasy. 
Roy(The owner) who is none other than a load of kindness and friendliness focuses on perfection. Which he does very well. 
Having been there well over ten times(Yes 10!) each time I arrive with a smile and leave with a bigger smile. 
The space is overall small, one table with several benches/chairs to sit down and devour your meal. Yes, you sit with other strangers(Mostly foodies!) it's a wonderful way to perahps strike a conversation or two or look at others take photos of their food(Such as myself) 
Non-coffee drinkers can rest assure and be sure that you will be more than satisfied with their teas and their Nutella hot chocolate.. Yes, Nutella! 

Their menu changes from time to time, yet it's always just deliciously perfect. You order a dish which may have something you don't like or nuts.. Don't stress about it, they will make sure you can still eat that dish according to your taste or allergies. 
I can think hard and long to see if I can find anything negative about Buck 15.. I simply can't. The only downside to their place, it often gets crowded. That's great! Why? Because it's hard work paying off and it shows. So, just be patient, and wait. It's worth it. I promise!
While you're there, say hello to Roy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee spots while visiting Montreal. The space is beautifully designed, with a bold and colorful mural that adds a lot of artfulness to the place. The coffee selection is good, and the food all looks delicious. (And some was homemade). The staff was beyond friendly, and seemed happy to be there. The only downsides were my cold brew, which was on the weak side, and the temperature, which was hot and stuffy."}
{"text":"Location: On Notre-Dame West, west of Atwater. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx. Street parking available.

The place: Though this café is on the small side (it has one community table), it runs high on energy. Minimal decor makes for a fresh, clean look, and the awesome mural by Stikki Peaches that showcases an entire wall, adds an eclectic and colourful vibrancy to the place. Love it! The concept here, is to create a friendly neighbourhood joint where friends and strangers alike can commune together over coffee. Don't know your neighbour? Start up a convo!

The goods: Excellent coffee - the barista doesn't mess around - he knows exactly what he's doing. Great espresso and excellent latté. They've also got almond milk, which makes me happy. 

Service: Roy, the owner, is über awesome. You can't get friendlier service than Buck 15 unless you head over to Olimpico. Roy is on a mission to make every client feel welcome,     and he takes the time to shoot the sh*t with everyone who walks in - he really just wants to get to know you. It's kinda like the modern day version of Cheers. 

Price point: Great - I can't remember how much I paid for my latté so that probably means it was cheap.

Buck 15 is a great new addition to the Southwest. I plan to visit often and you should too."}
{"text":"We must have passed this cafe a dozen times and never noticed it. It's tucked away and is a small space. The staff is incredibly welcoming and it has an inviting vibe. The food is unpretentious and completely delicious (toast with mushrooms, a red wine reduction and asiago cheese). The coffee was smooth and lovely (we had a cappuccino and a cold brew). Definitely going to be a regular hunt now."}
{"text":"Wow this place is really awesome, the service was really friendly and it shows they care!!!
First the espresso and cappuccinos are some of the best in Montreal, years ahead of any popular chain!
The breakfast menu is simple, minimalist and classy just like the decor!!! 
So I tried the toast with avocado and egg, it was almost a piece of art in my plate. Some really strong seasoning, quality bread and of course delicious avocado. 
Really a great feeling and experience. Unfortunately only a few seats !"}
{"text":"Le Buck 15, c'est la seule raison pourquoi je vais au marché Atwater, vraiment. J'ai beau te sortir n'importe quelle excuse, tu dois savoir qu'au fond, le sac de pomme que je \"dois\" aller acheter, c'est pour justifier le fait que j'ai fait un ride de métro de 20 minutes seulement pour pouvoir savourer un de leur fabuleux cappuccino. 

Le local est tape-à-l'il. Une grande murale arborant les dessins d'un artiste local est éclairée par les rayons du soleil, qui font leur chemin sans problème dans chaque recoin du café. Le propriétaire sera probablement celui qui vous accueillera à votre arrivée, un homme fier et souriant qui s'assurera de la qualité de votre boisson, que ce soit un espresso, un cold brew ou un pour-over (le plus parfait que j'ai goûté, by the way). Par contre, le Buck15 ne serait pas ce qu'il est sans son menu unique de tartines et pâtisseries. D'inspiration totalement californienne, on vous propose une tranche de pain épaisse surmontée de garnitures toutes aussi délectables au goût que pour les yeux. Avocat et uf mollet; banane, beurre d'arachide, miel et pétales de rose; Ricotta et fruits de saison; et la liste continue. C'est sans oublier leur brownie fondant au caramel et sel de maldon, leur gâteau aux pistaches et à la rose, ou encore leur yogourt de bufflonne surmonté de granola maison. La touche finale? Le chef qui, systématiquement, sortira de sa cuisine pour timidement vous demander ce que vous pensez de votre nourriture. Si ça c'est pas assez pour vous faire craquer, dites-le moi. Je suis tellement convaincue que vous tomberez en amour autant que moi avec le Buck15 que dans le tord, je vous donnerai mon sac de pomme: J'en voulais pas vraiment de toute façon."}
{"text":"Everthing we tried was so freshly prepared and so good, food deserves 5 stars! It's a tiny place but 4 of us were able to sit down  and enjoy our Sunday brunch. Service was great, the chef came and asked us if we were happy with everything."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, arty environment, good food and very warm staffs. I got there on a warm afternoon and ordered the cold brew. They are very creative and had coffee in a glass bottle, super cool! 
The kitchen guy recommended grilled cheese to me but I already had a lunch so I got the peanut butter toast instead with bananas and lots of nuts. 
Cool place, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny coffee shop in strategic location. They have delicious toasts, my peanut butter banana one was so good that I would certainly like to try the rest. As for the coffee, after two latte experiments, I would say it is good, but not necessarily the best I have had. It may take some time until you get your coffee and toast as there seems to be always a line up when I've been there. 

What I really like is the atmosphere of the place, the big community table and the smiling, friendly personnel, it all makes you feel this your neighbourhood coffee spot, where people know each other and leisurely stop to get their caffeine fix. The space is utilized to its maximum, designed in a practical and modern style. Very inviting and certainly I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a slice of San Francisco, here in Montreal. Exquisite handcrafted food  coming fresh from the kitchen with all the best ingredients Quebec has to offer. Fantastic brunch menu changes daily. Incredible pastries that look cookbook perfect. The coffee is outstanding and as warm as the vibe and the people of Buck15. LOVE THIS JOINT!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Roy, Missy, Saad, Mathieu and Elena and everyone else at Buck 15 make this such a joy to visit on a regular basis. The team makes this cafe a place to visit again and again. 

In terms of the food, the chefs always come up with interesting, sometimes Jamaican inspired specials during the week (come early as they often run out). The regular menu is hard to beat as well, some of the most beautifully designed and tasty meals you'll ever have. Even something as simple as scrambled eggs have an extra special taste that's hard to find anywhere else.

Make sure to also try their \"Keep it Cool\" Cold Brew which is made and bottled in house. You can even buy a case to take home (or have it delivered to your door).

There always seems to be seats despite it being quite busy, so worth the trip to the Atwater market area to check out this fine Montreal establishment."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Montreal and I just happened to stumble upon this place. The ladies inside were super nice and helpful, the pour over was delish (though a bit small for the price), and decor is very clean and classy. My friend hit the fresh squeezed orange juice and the cold brew. 

I did not order food, but I got to see some of it. Word on the street is that the avocado toast is to die for. The food is beautiful to say the least. A great little spot in the south west."}
{"text":"Stopped by Buck 15 for some breakfast. Initially I wanted the Bagel with smoked salmon but they only serve that on weekend which was a bummer but I found something I really enjoyed! It's called the Jammin Jerk Chicken Grilled Cheese. It was delicious, so cheesy and some amazing sauce and obviously the jerk chicken and a little bit of Prosciutto too! Great experience overall with great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Buck 15, home of elaborately prepared home brew coffee. There is some muttering and a lot of hand waiving involved. 

The result? Really exceptional coffee. 

Now if only they were open till like 6 or 6:30 pm."}
