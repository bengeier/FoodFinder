Bon accueil, belles portions...le risotto avec ses filets de perche était vraiment à découvrir. Malgré le monde, on ne se sent pas considéré comme des touristes. Bref allez y les yeux fermés"}

{"text":"Niente di entusiasmante, apro così questa mia recensione. 
Il posto è sicuramente carino ed in mezzo al piccolo centro del paesino affacciato sul magnifico lago, centro dove è molto comodo e interessante fare una bella camminata, il languorino si è fatto sentire presto e così abbiamo deciso di provare questo ristorantino, la veranda esterna era illuminata da un caldo sole e ci siamo seduti lì. Subito il servizio al tavolo e una ragazza gentile ha preso la comanda, il menù non è molto generoso, ha piatti di carne e pesce ma non la pizza, la scelta non è il massimo ed hanno anche due menù turistici che però difficilmente io consiglio perché in questi paesi turistici sono orientati quasi sempre sul flusso di tedeschi e americani che fanno la fortuna turistica di queste zone, italiani qui ne ho visti davvero pochi, quindi difficilmente trovate una buona qualità, si sa noi italiani siamo più difficili nel degustare, vogliamo sapore e qualità in giro ed io sono molto esigente.
Ho assaggiato un risotto al pesce persico che in realtà era pieno di burro e aveva poco di pesce, tranne qualche piccolo filettino di persico addirittura fritto messo sopra in triste visione...deludendo medio.
Lo spaghetto alle vongole che poi mi sono concesso a forchettate da un altro piatto era pieno di sabbia, errore gravissimo che ho fatto subito notare ma che ha lasciato il cameriere quasi indifferente, tanto ci sono i turisti...
La lista dei vini bianchi e rossi ha un ricarico davvero troppo elevato, in pratica analizzando le etichette che conosco ormai molto bene ho notato che costavano circa il triplo dei negozi, ci sta ed è normale un ricarico ma non in questi termini, la mia bottiglia di bianco era buona ma se siete ad esempio in comitiva mi sembra una esagerazione spendere un capitale solo di vino, dovrebbero abbassare un po' a beneficio anche delle famiglie forse.
Non ho preso i secondi visto la delusione iniziale e sono certo di aver fatto la scelta giusta, il dessert invece era un buon tiramisù fatto in casa, mentre gli altri erano prodotti di pasticceria almeno da menù.
Abbiamo pagato uno sproposito considerando la scarsa qualità, insomma pagate il posto turistico in sostanza. Almeno rilasciano la ricevuta va..."}
{"text":"Good food, nice vibe, friendly service in a good location of billagio. 4 stars not 5 bc the food was good, not great"}
{"text":"I always eat here for a meal or two each time I am in Bellagio. 

The food is fresh and delicious. The service is great, and the value excellent. 

After you are filled with good food and drink the owner will probably show you a small photo album of Bilacus looking quite pretty over the course of the four seasons."}
{"text":"Initially planned to go for dinner here during our weeklong stay along Lake Como.
However, too many great Italian dinners at our place and now leftovers to finish, drove us to decide to come here for lunch instead.

Arrived shortly after noon, on a weekday, and they accommodated our party of 7 promptly.

For lunch, an appetizer and two dishes from the Primi menu were very satisfying for a couple.  Good food and reasonable prices, all while sitting on a rooftop with overhead vines. They also have the local dish of Perch and Risotto. Food was fantastic, setting is idyllic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's my first time in Bellagio and through Yelp's high review of this place, six friends and I decided to have dinner there. The food was amazing and the outdoor seating was perfect this time of year. The risotto with fish was so good that it got all six friends fighting for the last bite! Bravo! I totally recommend this place if you are looking for some good Italian food. We come from Australia, Sweden, Singapore and Belgium and all give this place a thumbs up."}
{"text":"We ate at Bilacus on the recommendation of a relative and it was indeed a good recommendation. True, in Bellagio there are few truly 'bad' restaurants, but I think Bilacus is just a bit better. My dining companion had the panzarotti which she deemed delicious and I had the meat ravioli with mushrooms, equally delicious.  We shared a single second course, it was lake fish sauteed in butter and seasoned with sage, so good.

The outdoor seating was pleasant with a delicate breeze at our back and the view down the street, twisting downhill out of view. The day was warm, mid eighties (28 for you locals) but it was cool on the restaurant's terrace.

The service was very good, each of them with a good command of English. Did I mention the prices for an upscale neighborhood were very reasonable? True! But it is the food that makes the restaurant,  and they certainly delivered."}
{"text":"Was one of my favorite restaurants in Bellaggio!  And, you feel like you're in someone's home.  Everything was fabulous, from the wine selection to the food to the desert. Loved it. We went at the end of our trip, and I wish I had gone earlier so we could've made a repeat visit before we left."}
{"text":"We actually stumbled upon this place by accident and weren't aware of the great reviews. They were all booked up for the good tables on the balcony, but we gladly accepted a table in the front of the restaurant. All our dishes were excellent. I love penne arrabbiata and theirs was outstanding. Good service and great food. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it!  We were greeted warmly and the service was very friendly.  We had home made pastas and the duck antipasta.  We were all smiles when we left."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect since Bellagio offers so many highly rated restaurants, but this was definitely the right choice for dinner. My wife and I just barely found a sit, and had very good local white wine and beer. We ordered the roast veal, which was divine, and the cheese ravioli in butter sage sauce, which was amazing, and one of the best pastas we'd eaten. For desert we ordered the tiramisu and panacota. The panacota was a bit ordinary, though still very yummy, and the tiramisu was exquisite. Overall good service and reasonable prices, so highly recommended in Bellagio."}
{"text":"Ambiente arioso, ampia sala e ampio dehors terrazzato, colori caldi e stile rustico chic. 
Cucina tipica lariana di ottima qualità. Buona selezione di ottimi vini.
Buon servizio.
Buon rapporto qualità-prezzo.
Consigliato per un appuntamento galante."}
{"text":"Yea, it is ok.  The bread was poor.  The risotto was decent and the bolognese were the same."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Bilacus on our last night of a two-week long road trip around Europe, and I am so grateful we chose this restaurant as I can't imagine a better ending to our adventure.  We had stepped in and made reservations during the afternoon while we were out walking around Bellagio, which I would recommend since the restaurant was quite busy when we came back later for dinner.  The backyard terrace was very comfortable on an early May evening.  The wine selection was good (although if you're really looking for wine, check Apertivo Et Al basically next door), and the service was excellent.  There were more than a few tables speaking English around us, so I'm guessing word is getting around to tourists.  The highlight of our meal was the European Sea Bass (not the same fish as we're used to seeing in the U.S.) plated with roasted potatoes and carrots.  It wasn't overly fussy, but full of flavor and the fish was perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"We found this ristorante by chance...it was up an alley from our hotel and off the beaten path...we came in one evening, were seated out on the patio under the arbor and everything was perfect!  The salad, local fish entree and the house wine was superb!  We came back the next night in a steady drizzling rain and sat inside (of course).  Same great service, food, ambiance...the owner came around and made us feel a part of the extended family!!!"}
{"text":"Bilacus is a very nice restaurant, which I frequently go to every time I am in Bellagio. The food  ranges from good to very good, but the main reason I go there is for the lovely atmosphere in the restaurant's enchanting little garden. I have had both lunch and dinner at Bilacus, but mostly the former, which I would also recommend. The staff is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic location with the outdoor patio. I was in when they had the Como Lake perch risotto, it was absolutely perfect- small fillets on top of a well-executed risotto with sage leaves. Get yourself a jug of wine and clear the rest of your  day because you'll be in a food coma. 

Great service, fair value for money, I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"I spent 10 days in Italy. My dinner at Bilacus was the worst meal I ate.

It's odd that a meal here fell so flat. When we asked our hotel for recommendations, the clerk pointed to Bilacus immediately. We were excited to dine here.

Because Lake Como can get fairly chilly at night, Bilacus has a semi-enclosed outdoor porch area with heat lamps. When you're seated, you may also be offered a blanket. That's a nice touch.

I looked up above the table to see a mesh screen on a window leading to the kitchen. It was coated in grease/oil. It's the kind of thing Gordon Ramsay would spot on \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and scream at the owner about. If they don't notice or care about yellow slicks on their window screens, where else are they dropping the ball?

I began with the penne arrabiata (10). The sauce was watery and mostly flavorless. A definite letdown.

For my second course, I went with the tagliata griglia (steak, 20). This was the real crime. The cut of meat was really awful - tough and gristly. Despite asking for it medium rare, it was clearly cooked medium well. I ate other steaks in Italy that practically disintegrated when my knife hit the meat. At Bilacus, I was forced to saw away at a steak that had all the texture of an old boot.

The total damage for our meal was 77.50, which is horrendous for the poor quality of the food.

During our time in Lake Como, we vastly preferred BabaYaga and La Fontana. If you find yourself headed toward Bilacus, keep strolling on. There are better, less expensive meals all around."}
{"text":"perfect! Great atmosphere in the garden/terrace. Try the Caprese salad and Pampadelle with mushroom sauce."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Food was fantastic, location/scenery on the terrace looks like a painting and the service was superb. Highly recommend the saltimbocca. I had high expectations based on the number of locals that recommended the place and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"One of the best lunches we ate in Italy! A must visit for a long multi course meal. The wine was great and the ambiance was fantastic"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. My wife and I ate there 3 times when we stayed in Bellagio. Fresh ingredients are used to make simple high quality dishes that taste good and aren't trying too hard.  We witnessed a lot of people turned away. Make sure you set up a reservation. We always came early before the dinner rush so we were able to get a table. This restaurant was one of the best overall dining experiences we had in Italy. Better than many more expensive restaurants in Rome, Milan and Venice."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We had a mixed cheese platter as antipasti and spaghetti vongole and risotto as main courses accompanied by some white wine (recommendation of the waiter). Everything was super delicious and the service excellent - and the prices were also absolutely reasonable. Totally recommendable!!"}
{"text":"Good food well-served.  The pumpkin soup is to die for!  And the local white wine we enjoyed was very memorable."}
{"text":"We were not disappointed in lunch for four. Did not make the cut for the outdoor dining on the terrace but enjoyed inside nonetheless. Excellent selection on the menu and a huge wine list with reasonable prices. Started off with a liter of house red wine - decent, fantastically fresh and flavorful melon and prosciutto. Grilled vegetable antipasto was Ok-tomatoes, zucchini, red peppers and eggplant-a little boring. One dish meal of risotto in a creme sauce with fresh, lightly breaded lake perch was excellent. Shared with our friend as was plenty for me and he wished he had ordered. Grilled seabass was very good, ravioli in sage butter sauce also rated good reviews. Only dish that did not hit the spot was the pasta arribiata-proclaimed a tad boring and not spicy.  Two tiramisu-watched them make were perfect.  110 for all of that for 4 including 2 waters and the coperto, so not a bad deal in Bellagio for a big meal. Service was friendly and did pretty well until the end when it fell off a little."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable price of 15-20 Euros per entre and wine by the glass starting at 5 Euros. I had the lake como fish combo and my wife had the grilled sea bass. Both were great."}
{"text":"We came there a bit randomly during family vacations. We ordered anti pasti, cheese, ravioli and trout. We also had a glass of chianti. The food was really good, it tasted fresh and at a decent price for such a touristic place."}
{"text":"We have been eating our way through Italy and only wanted some nice pasta and wine for lunch..and this was it!  The penne arrabiata was excellent, but the meat ravioli with mushrooms and cream sauce was spectacular!  Eating on the terrace during a brilliantly sunny spring day didn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"The view is fantastic; we lucked out and got a table on the edge of the terrace without a reservation for lunch. Service was a little lacking. Prices are a little high. Trio of fish was disappointing, especially since it is described as being accompanied by a side dish which ended up being a single spoonful of diced roasted vegetables. The ravioli with mushrooms in cream sauce was fantastic."}
{"text":"If you are NOT italian do not go here!!! They are a SCAM. We ate a sub par meal, and when it was time to pay the credit \"credit card machine did not work\" even though we saw it being used minutes before with some elderly Italian ladies. They wanted cash to avoid taxes. Sub par service with a scam. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! 
Rip off and down right deceitful!!!"}
{"text":"Food: overall good...

Appetizer: melon with prosciutto...meet was fresh not too salty, melon was just right

Pasta
Pasta with bolognese...nothing special...sauce was ok not too salty but as you can see from the picture the sauce was a bit on the salty side

Atmosphere: nice and relaxing...there is an indoor restaurant and a patio outside which is nice for groups

Service: ok, waiter checked in from time to time but room forever to get the bill...

If I was in the area i would go back and try other dishes"}
{"text":"One of the cutest little restaurants I've ever been to! I absolutely LOVE the outdoor terrace area. Great for people watching or to just soak in the beauty of Bellagio. 

I ordered the Ravioli alla Montanara (meat ravioli w/ mushrooms & a cream sauce) and it was SO GOOD.  The sauce was bomb and the mushrooms and ravioli were cooked to perfection. My boyfriend ordered the Penne alla Caruso (penne with chicken and vegetable in tomato and cream sauce) and that was pretty good as well. 

We also ordered a trout dish that ended up being very disappointing. The fish tasted very bland and the lemon sauce didn't help. 

Besides the trout, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. They also have a good selection of wine which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Very happy with my lunch! Mushroom stuffed pasta, wine, and tiramisu. Just perfect! Would go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food! Definitely worth a visit if you are staying in Bellagio"}
{"text":"If I ever go back to Lake Como - my first stop for dinner will be at Ristorante Bilacus. I had read about this place online and asked our hotel staff about it when we arrived in Bellagio.  They said it was one of the best restaurants in the city and was run by a family.  We reserved a table on the terrace and loved this place.

I am still dreaming of the homemade tagliolini in mushroom bolognese sauce. My husband ordered the filet, which he enjoyed. But the tagliolini took the prize. Delicious! Good wine list and fair prices. The wait staff wasn't the absolute greatest, but I'd go back for the food in a second."}
{"text":"If you want traditional Italian dishes, fine wines, great service and delicious deserts this is the place for you. 

We had a great experience here. Everyone is super friendly. The food is awesome. We started with linguine and vongole then had pappardelle bolognse with mushrooms. Also amazing. And yes we could get those dishes back home BUT not as good as it was here. 

Then came the real treat. In the little restaurant across the street,  more of a take out kind of place. There was a lot of action. So I went over to see what was going on. Right in front were three copper pot mixers with what looked like large balls of dough being mixed. But it was polenta. Under the bowls were burners and in the bowls were mixing blades like in a cement mixer. There were lots of people buzzing around the three bowls with a man with s large knife slicing into the ball of polenta and another man with a large wooden paddle pushing the ball around in the bowl all the while the mixing blades are going. Then there were the bosses, the women who were supervising to make sure the men didn't screw up. Lol. 

I'm watching this whole thing in awe. The one mixer saw me watching and gave me a piece of the cheese that was going into the polenta to try. It was delicious!! Then he pointed to a large bowl with about 10 lbs of the cheese in it and then a stack of about 20lbs of butter. He pointed to both and then the polenta. Although I didn't understand a single word he said the message was quite clear. All that butter and cheese was going into the polenta. 

Goodness gracious I thought how can that be. The volume of cheese and butter was almost more than the polenta!!

Then a mob started gathering outside as the polenta was being finished after being continuously mixed, sliced, remixed with the wooden paddle, transferred from one mixing bowl to the next and cooked for 3 hours. 
It was ready to be served. It was polenta pandemonium. 
There was a mob for hours outside lining up to get their polenta. 

At that point our reservation was ready we sat outside on the street side of the upper terrace and we could see what was going on over at polenta central. 

The owner of Balicus who is the nicest guy came over and we were talking and he explained about the polenta. It's made only once a year for a charity event and you can't just buy it. You have to preorder it. And it is in very high demand, an understatement if there ever was one. You have no idea what was going on over there. 

Well after we finished our two courses of pasta a plate of polenta appears in the middle of our table. My jaw dropped. I looked at it and thought to my self it looks very dense. So my wife and I each took a forkful and once the polenta got into your mouth it changed from a dense dry looking compound to the most velvety delicious thing you ever ate. From that moment of conversion which by the way my wife and I reached at the same time it was a race to the end. I think I one won by a forkful. Lol   I then scraped the plate clean and licked the forks clean. So far it's been the highlight of my trip to Italy. 

Then we had our entrees. I had the local lake perch. Never had perch before. It's a light and delicious fish. I highly recommend. My wife had the grilled prawns. Very fresh and delicious. We had also ordered a bowl of white beans with rosemary and red sauce. It was so good I would have eaten the whole bowl but just couldn't do it. 

Somehow we found room to eat some of the best chocolate cake ever and the owners mom's apple cake. 
We were beyond full but it was so good we just kept eating. We couldn't finish it all no matter how hard we tried     

I had a glass of Corsatto wine with my cake it's an expensive glass of wine but it was Devine! And worth every Euro!!

Well I had the wife pay the bill cause I couldn't sit any longer. I had to get up and walk outside. I thought I was going to explode. I had to move around. I think the polenta was expanding and my body was trying to metabolize all that food and was generating lots of heat. I was sweating big time all of a sudden. Thankfully a walk along the lake and a glass of fine Grappa at Serbelloni settled me 

Not planning on breakfast or lunch today. 

Would I go back and do it again? You betcha!!"}
