{"text":"Oh boy! C'est loin d'être un 4 étoiles comme plusieurs mentionnent en anglais. 

Avec Pho Nam Do, pas loin, ce resto se mérite à peine 2 étoiles. Le riz Minute Rice, les petits bouts de vieille iceberg et de vielles carottes, non merci. 

Y'a quasiment jamais personne dans ce resto (j'habite pas loin), je sais maintenant pourquoi. 

J'donnerais 3 étoiles à ce resto si c'était vraiment pas cher comme bouffe et j'y retournerais. Mais sortir de là avec une facture de 22$ pour une table d'hôte, no thank you."}
{"text":"After travelling Vietnam, I've come to have pretty low expectations of Montreal's Vietnamese food scene (every menu seems to be 70% pho, 20% pan-Asian cuisine and 10% grilled meat dishes and few fresh herbs in sight).  

Nhu Y is not one of those places. Yes, there's pho on the menu (one type) and there's the typical pan-Asian (general tao, pad thai, some curries, spring and imperial rolls). BUT there are things on the menu I had not seen outside of Vietnam. Bahn xeo (outta this world), fried sweet potato and shrimp cakes (be still my heart), catfish soup and shrimp pâté with sugar cane (I'm eyeing those for future delicious) And the caramel fish. 

Everything comes with a mountain of varied fresh herbs, the food is perfectly balanced and spiced and my god-- even the pork is cooked exactly like I've come to expect on my travels! ... and well it should be-- the lovely lady who runs the place is from Ho Chi Minh and even after thirty five years of being away from home, still has the charm and hospitality and tradition fare I'd been craving."}
{"text":"I come to this little hole in the wall for the Midi Express. It's no frills, authentic for the most part (I spent two weeks in Vietnam) and there's lots of variety. Note: they can get a bit overwhelmed at lunch, but it's a solid choice."}
{"text":"Just finished a good meal here. Clean, friendly, effecient service. Not a place for varieties of pho but if you're looking for out of the norm Vietnamese dishes then this is the place to try. We had Bun Thang , Cha Ca + extra noodles, and combo C (house soup, imperial roll, chicken with peanut/coconut milk sauce, rice and tea), Vietnamese style iced-coffee which came to about $48 with tax and tip for 3 people.  Our waitress spoke Vietnamese, French and a decent amount of English.  It also participates in BYOW."}
{"text":"Really Excellent food, with an authentic feel. I've had Vietnamese food in many locations in Montreal (and other cities) and this one ranks high for service, and overall food quality. Looking forward to trying something new on their menu on a future visit !"}
{"text":"Simply put, this was the best Vietnamese dinning experience I have ever had after having lived in New York and Montreal for nearly ten years each.  Almost all their dishes are served with a generous portion of herbs (vietnamese spicy mint, purple perilla, vietnamese balm, coriander, etc), adding a refreshing aroma to their culinary wonder.  Extremely satiating and budget friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and I've constantly been blown away. It's a bit small and unassuming, but this restaurant is big where it counts.
The freshness of the ingredients really shines and the prices are great.
I recommend you try one of the \"specialty\" items for everyone in your group and ask them to serve them to you back-to-back so you can share. They'll bring you one item at a time until you finish it, at which point another even more delicious dish will be brought out! This way you can try more food, enjoy more flavour and it's a great sharing experience. I'd also recommend having some papaya salad and spring roll to whet your appetite before your feast.
I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Lot of oil in the shrimp paste dish. Abundance of leafy and minty greens was nice. The shrimp on sweet potatoes was ok, but there's a lot of fried batter here. Service was not good; we felt as if we were greatly imposing on the lady for every request we had (i.e. extra bowl, plates). Bun thang was ok. The monkfish was not good, too much fried content here."}
{"text":"As you may know, Vietnam was colonized by the French for many, many long years, so it has a French influence (like in the french bread Vietnamese sandwiches made famous by Lee's Sandwiches, which are franchised everywhere). 

So here in Montreal, it is only natural to find many Vietnamese restaurants, just like in France. 

Nhu Y restaurant is known for its Chef, who was trained in French cooking schools in Vietnam. The 2 dishes this restaurant is famous for according to the local Vietnamese diaspora is Canh Chua Ca Bong Lau, or sweet and sour Catfish Soup, which has a great mix of flavors. And the other is their signature appetizer, Chicken Wings, marinated in Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) and crisped up for a great combination of texture and flavor. 

Tres Delicieux!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese food of very high quality.  Strong flavors and generous portions of sprouts and greens.  Attentive hostess/cook.  Not on the level of the South Vietnamese empire in northern Virginia, but to be thought of and mentioned in that context is compliment enough.

I am confused as to why Loi 101 does not mandate the translation of \"Nhu Y\" into French.  Mostly because I enjoy \"Cafe Starbucks Coffee,\" \"Poulet Frit Kentucky,\" \"L'Usine de Spaghetti\" and \"Bureau en Gros\" so damn much."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic Vietnamese food, some dishes were as good as what I had in Vietnam. Not westernized and they don't cut corners. The Banh Xeo and Bun Cha are both must eats. I didn't get a chance to try their Bun Bo, but plan to next time I'm here."}
