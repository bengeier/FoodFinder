{"text":"Very pleased. The pork belly beans were a pleasant surprise. I was unsure if I wanted the Curly Wolf, the guy taking my order let me try the sauce. Sold! I enjoyed my sandwich, the okra was crispy, just like I asked. The brisket sandwich I got for my dad was gone when I looked over at his plate. I got take out, but I did notice a dog-friendly patio. I will return to this bbq joint on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Omg the ribs are so amazing here! :) by far the best bbq ribs I have had :) I had ordered a full slab, which is in fact more than enough for a family of maybe 3-4 people, which I ended up eating shamelessly on my own over 2 meals :) Great place and the portions are amazing for the price. Love the sides too! I'll be going in soon for more of the sandwiches and meat delights they have on the menu. 

The service is good, and the people there are real nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Good bbq and cold beer. Very friendly staff. The brisket is perfect and their cornbread is amazing."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with several things!  The BBQ sandwich literally melted in my mouth.  It was so good.  The okra and Mac & cheese were amazing as well.  Best of all,  the people working there were so very kind. 

I will definitely be enjoying Danky's again."}
{"text":"Wow! Some of the best BBQ I have had in the valley. Also the customer service was excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good BBQ place that slow cooks the meat but doesn't dry it out and is NOT a chain. We found it! This  is a small little resturant with a BIG taste. It is clean and Mike the chef is very accommodating. This is a MUST TRY. Spicy, sweet, beef, brisket,  pork and chicken. Don't forget to have the homemade apple pie and sweet tea!!!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! I had the beef brisket and  Mac-n-cheese it was very delicious. The staff was super friendly and I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the lunch special for a quick and cheap meal. I will definitely be coming back for dinner as they were prepping some ribs while I was there and they looked and smelled unreal. This place is clean and friendly, plus they make all their sandwiches and plates to order so everything is super fresh. Can't wait to come back and try some more stuff!"}
{"text":"Great local bbq place. Glad to have this near our house. A couple visits ago he have me the Schmikey (brisket, cheese whiz (I think), bbq sauce on a soft bun). It was a happy accident because I would have never ordered it. But it's so good,  I get that every time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, Andy, and I just stopped in for a quick lunch as we saw that this had just opened.  Andy LOVES barbecue, but I am not a fan of barbecued food or barbecue sauce and I have to say that Danky's Bar-B-Q has changed that for me!  The first bite that I took of my (very tender and juicy) chicken breast with the traditional sauce was absolutely delectable.  The cornbread was delicious as was the macaroni and cheese.  To top it off, Pat and Chad were extremely friendly, and when we asked if they would be selling their barbecue sauce by the bottle, they sent us home with some!  I would recommend this place to anyone, even those who aren't a fan of BBQ, because Danky's changed my mind about BBQ food!  We will definitely be returning here once we finish our leftovers!!"}
{"text":"Best place for brisket, customer service is top notch. My favorite BBQ spot in Scottsdale hands down."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving bbq and we found Danky's online. Great food and awesome customer service. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and it didn't disappoint and really exceeded my expectations. If your looking for real BBQ, good tunes, and affordable prices, this spot is for you. Going back tomorrow for lunch to get the brisket and beans."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I found the absolute perfect barbecue place. Being from Dallas I'm always looking for Texas BBQ and Danky's fits the bill. Best brisket ever. This sauce is absolutely amazing. Plus they have several other sauces that are just as tasty as the regular. It is my go-to place on Sundays. The french fries are crazy good too. Definitely try it"}
{"text":"GET THE BAKED BEANS!! Everything I've eaten here is very good. My fav is the pork and baked beans. Did I mention you should get the baked beans?"}
{"text":"Caveman-q pork and chicken thigh was delicious. The beans and mac n cheese were great too."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great BBQ sauce. Ah, my mouth is watering just thinking about the meal I had yesterday!"}
{"text":"I got there pulled brisket sandwich... To die for! Great atmosphere, great workers, all around great place!"}
{"text":"We split a full rack with sides. The portion was delicious and generous. The baked beans are a MUST. Patrick and his crew were very welcoming and made us feel comfortable despite the fact that we arrived close to closing time. A return visit is a must."}
{"text":"Great ribs and great owner. We came in close to closing time and ordered the 2 meat platter with mac and cheese. Dynamite bbq here! 

Owner came over at closing time and asked if we wanted some pulled pork to take home as there was left over and he didn't want to hold it to tomorrow. Yes please! 

Would recommend for anyone looking for top notch bbq in the $10-15 per person price range."}
{"text":"This is my first ever review and I just think it's necessary. I love this place. I get my order to go every Thursday and every Thursday just like today, when I'm done eating I am just happy. Classic pork sandwich, side of okra is my go to but everything is really good. 
My beautiful wife had a brisket sandwich with regular BBQ sauce and jalape√±os and was sort of in a dreamy state after.
Cole slaw is awesome. Beans are decent. Get the okra!
Don't forget the ribs! Pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ! The ribs are fall off the bone, tender and delicious. A little bit too spicy for a couple people in my family, but perfect for the rest. I really enjoy their hot links- juicy and flavorful. Make sure to go earlier, because they sometimes run out of things (hey, good ribs take time!). Overall, definitely a cute little place and definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Danky's catered dinner for our group of 20 golfers.  Served brisket, ribs, beans, slaw, corn muffins, and some special sauce.  This was really good bar-b-Q!!  They arrived on time and helped set up our event.  While we dined at several restaurants (Blanco's, Two Brothers, Blue 32, and Phil's Grille), Danky's was voted best meal for our trip!!"}
{"text":"3 meat combo - Chicken Breast, Brisket, Hot Links w/ pork belly beans

The smoke smells hits you from the door. As a relocated southerner, I was surprised to find a place like Danky's in my area. A little drive from my house but I try to go at least once a month the quench my \"caveman\" thirst.

ESPN + Tailgating style food and beers + The best beans you will ever eat = Dank"}
{"text":"Unreal good BBQ! The meat was the perfect balance of smoke and flavour, the sauces were a perfect t balance between sweet, spicy and hot and the team was super helpful and friendly. I can see why Danky's is winning awards here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really a good find. In town for work and hungry for some cue. This place did not disappoint. The pork and chicken were very good. The beans are the star of the show, though. So very good. The javelina sauce is a really unique mix of BBQ sauce and salsa verde, so good on the chicken. Nice selection of craft beer in the can which is the superior vessel for those in the know."}
{"text":"My husband and I both got the Schmikey. It was delicious. The mixture of the cheese and the BBQ sauce was so yummy. It's not overly spicy sauce, so if you're looking for super kick you may not like it. I thought it was just right!! My husband got the bigger size sandwich, but I didn't really notice a great difference in the amount of food he got. 

As far as sides go, we loved the fresh cut fries and the macaroni was delicious (add salt). The beans were good, but we probably wouldn't order those again."}
{"text":"Ribs fell off the bone perfectly, smoked fried chicken was amazing, brisket was very tender. Creamy mac and cheese, fried okra and French fries for our sides were excellent as well."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional. Friendly staff and unbelievable smoked meats. We have been all over the country and this place is one of our top ranking barbecue stops. It's worth a trip to mouth watering world."}
{"text":"Oh my yum!!! Soooo good! My family and I are from out of town and we were sent here by a car saleswoman. It did NOT disappoint, we did two of the 3 meat platters, and 3 sides for a group of four. If you like fried okra, it is made to serve. I watched them batter and put them in deep fryer. Beans were also really good, and coleslaw was welll coleslaw. All in all it was nice to be able to try a little bit of everything, and have several flavors bite after bite. If you are from out of town looking for some good BBQ I recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue restaurant in the area. They are located in the strip shopping center where Walmart is located. They're pulled pork sandwiches and platters are cooked perfectly. Their brisket is moist and tender. Their regular barbecue sauce is good but a little tart and I wish they would offer a sweeter alternative. This is a small place and seating is at a premium. They'll soon be putting in outside seating which should help. The side dishes are not great but the meat is so good you really don't notice. It is family run restaurant and everybody is very helpful and friendly. Overall if you like good barbecue this is the place to go."}
{"text":"So good. Tried their #4 combo. Brisket, ribs, and chicken were perfectly seasoned and very tender. On top of great food and service, the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Had a craving for 4th of July ribs and decided to try my neighbor Danky's. At 5:00 pm there was only one table present.  Staff was very friendly but highly disorganized.  I ordered the 1/2  slab rib dinner at the cost of $19.00 !   I asked for sauce on the side (just in case).  After 20 min., they finally delivered my order with TONS of sauce all over it. They offered to replace it but I simply requested to have them wipe it off. 15 min. later I received a new order with the sauce on the side as requested.  Sauce was thin and HOT / spicy.  My mouth was on fire from dipping into the sauce in between bites. I tried to order the infamous apple pie and was informed that the owner, who makes it, took the day off for the holiday.  Based on previous reviews, this has happened many times before. The portion size, compared to others offering this description, was off with tiny sides, and I left hungry and disappointed. Cornbread which was supposed to be included was omitted. The 3 additional customers who came in within the hour ALL received \"I'm sorry's\", for the misc. delays and errors.  Other full service restaurants offering 1/2 slab dinners deliver a salad and sides worthy of a $19.00 ticket...Won't be back."}
{"text":"Real smokehouse, we love the meats and beans the best but that's just our style. Great music. Small place very family friendly. if a bit of smokiness on your clothes laterto remind you of your meal isn't your thing order takeout!"}
{"text":"I came in to get lunch the place is really small so there were no tables but no worries I took it to go. I got the Large brisket sandwich with coleslaw on it and an order of fries. The sandwich was big! It had the perfect amount of sauce on it and was so good. The fries are fresh and very yummy. I'm just sad I couldn't finish them because I was so full. Only reason I knocked off a star is because there was nowhere to sit but I will def be back."}
{"text":"Went here after the Phoenix Open and was starving. Their ribs were amazing,  my husband had the mac n cheese which we both loved and the schmikey sandwich which he devoured. The owner was absolutely nice and attentive, the young lady who rang up our order was informative and helpful with picking out what to eat. We truly enjoyed this place. Oh! The apple pie they make there.... get that too"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a Small Business restaurant owner in the neighborhood.  The food and service was great.  Important to support local!  We want them to stay.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"First time going, I had the classic pull pork sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious. I know next time I'll be getting the ribs.  The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"$40 for (2) two meat lunch platters and a couple cans of soda is absurd for even high quality BBQ! This isn't even approaching decent BBQ. The brisket is cut paper thin (sign of overcompensation for dryness) and served in such a small portion. The beans tasted like they have thyme in them which is off putting. I couldn't finish them. The hot link was above average. Overall I am supremely disappointed in my visit and will not return. Turns out there is a good reason to sit through long lines outside to get a crack at Little Miss BBQ's food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I got chicken plates with fries and coleslaw. The chicken was great, my wife loved the fries, and I thought the coleslaw wasn't bad. It isn't soggy like alot of coleslaws. I wasn't huge in their bbq sauces, but if you like spicy you'll probably love them. They had to much kick for me. I'd say add a few sauces in there and the rankys would be even better. For sure going back"}
{"text":"We loved it! My family went their after going to soccer mall because we found it on yelp. The food was very good and the staff was very friendly. The home made bbq sauce was very good and the french fries were to die for. I hope you will read this and go to Dankys because it wasn't very busy and we want it to stay in business. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"They have the most awesome ribs and side dishes! The meat just fell off the bone, moist, tender and delicious! I read a lot of good things about them and they were all true!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix....and one of the best I've had in the USA. It's a small place (the best ones always are) so make sure you get there early or give yourself enough time. Pro tip: the beans are the best side, the brisket and pulled pork the best mains."}
{"text":"Being from Texas finding good BBQ is a real challenge.  Danny's is some of the best BBQ I've found outside of Austin."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Ordered chicken sandwich. I don't know how they prepped the chicken but it tasted pretty basic was hoping for a nice smokey flavor or great char on it. Bun was cold. Was hoping for something more exciting or traditional. Bummer sandwiches don't come standard with a side but have to order it. Maybe offer a combo deal. At the price point I don't see myself coming back. Giving an extra star because they offer beer. Good bbq should make you want to stuff yourself and feel full, this I didn't mind the portion was small. Underwhelming. Always wanna support the local guys but not this time. Best of luck."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. Only issue we thought was mac and cheese is too dry, MORE CHEESE! The man that waited on us was very helpful with our order, can't remember his name. We were there Sunday the 17th about 2;45. Thanks see ya again."}
{"text":"Good barbecue. We've driven by this place quite a few times now and had to stop. The mesquite aromas that waft into the Parking lot forces you to look around in wonder. The meat was incredible. Extremely flavorful, moist and tender. I really appreciate a truly real smoked process that allows the meat to reach its full potential. The barbecue sauce is a peppery and tangy combo. The sides were a bit disappointing as the mac and cheese and coke slaw could use a bit more flavor. But this place definitely gets 4 starts because the most important part of BBQ is the meat and sauce! The service was awesome and they are super friendly and nice taking care of us throughout our dining experience."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch today and I watched the two gentleman attempt to fill one order for 20 minutes. I had already paid for my meal, but I just didn't have the time to deal with trying to get a refund.  It almost seemed like the staff was having a very hard time focusing.  Service this slow is unacceptable. BBQ places in phoenix have a hard time surviving. If you add bad service to the mix your days in business are numbered."}
{"text":"Danky's will treat you well! We found this welcoming hole in the wall about a year ago and we keep coming back! My husband called in our order and by the time they arrived the back had ran out of their famous brisket. The owner greeted my hubs by name and apologized and sent us home with wonderful ribs instead- on the house! Highly recommend the pulled pork and their sides are great, too. Their roasty-herb flavors are great on their own or add on the spicy BBQ sauce in spoonfuls! Thanks Goliath!"}
{"text":"I stopped in after reading other reviews. In short, I loved it. Although the javelina sauce is not prominently mentioned on the menu, you gotta try it! Wow. Very good on a pork sandwich. I didn't care much for the danky sauce. The Cole slaw was exactly how I like it- light on the Mayo and crunchy. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The caramel salted fries are awesome. The beans... Delicious. Pulled pork very good and a nice portion. Try this place immediately."}
{"text":"This was the best barbecue I have had in Phoenix. The beef was moist, tender and the traditional sauce had great flavor with a bit of a bite to it. I found the same moist and tender meat in the pulled pork and the barbecue chicken. The restaurant is relatively new and they are adding additional items and making a few tweaks to the side dishes.  I have not tried the ribs yet but if they are anything like the beef, pork and chicken sandwiches I  can't wait to try them."}
{"text":"We spotted this new BBQ place near our house.  So gad we gave it a try.  We both had pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and side of beans. Deliciousness!  I couldn't recognize it but there was a really good spice in the beans. We were too full or we would have tried the apple pie. Next time for sure!  Cant wait to try tother menun items. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times, ordered 3 different items and all are fantastic!!  I have been wanting to try their slab of ribs, but every time I go they are completely sold out:-(.  The owners are friendly and you can tell they really care about their food and what their customers think!  This is going to be a regular BBQ place for me."}
{"text":"I was visiting in town and saw this place reviewed on yelp.  The place was amazing!!  Great food.  BBQ brisket was moist and juicy.  Sauces are great!"}
{"text":"Danky's catered our celebration of life event after our team did the ALS awareness walk in Scottsdale last weekend. Patrick Frederick, the owner, was very good to us and most helpful. More importantly, the food was awesome and truly a crowd pleaser. So good we did round two and three with the leftovers!!!"}
{"text":"Stellar BBQ. Southern Mess, Mockingbird and even some burnt ends were still available!  Great to see them grow over the last year!!"}
{"text":"Was craving amazing BBQ and they delivered. The atmosphere is home-like; the customer service was exceptional, and the sauce was phenomenal. Will be back again in the near future, and will tell my friends and family to try it out."}
{"text":"Nice people.  Good food. Uncomfortable seating and very little room. If you can get past that then check this place out. The food is quite good!"}
{"text":"Had to give Danks' another try since it is right by work.... had the Brisquet and was pleased by the improvement in the portion this time as well as the quality of the cut.  The staff was more than accommodating which was nice .... I'll be back for a third try soon."}
{"text":"In town for an adult baseball tournament and needed a good meal. Read previous reviews of Danky's and decided to give it a try.  Ribs, pork, sausage chicken, brisket were all exceptional.  The sauce is very good.  Sides were generous. Baked beans are extremely tasty....not big on ambience but food was great, beer cold and TVs had sports on! Very clean restrooms too!  Highly recommended....."}
{"text":"My recommendation is getting the Chicken Thigh platter.  The chicken thighs tasted very good,  nice smokey and moist with good flavor where you can get the sauce on the side.  The pork was cooked well but you definitely need sauce all over it otherwise it doesn't have much flavor. As far as the sauces,  if you're getting a platter definitely go with the Original BBQ sauce. Dankys sauce would be good on sandwiches because it's not so much BBQ it's more of a smokey sweet relishy sauce.  I was not a big fan of the Javelina sauce. Over all I give this place 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"If you are in the Phoenix valley and you are looking for GREAT BBQ you want to stop by this place. Great options on meat plates and their side and good too. I highly recommend the BBQ Ribs or the Brisket."}
{"text":"Great bbq. The smoked chicken thighs and beef brisket were juicy and well-seasoned. Cornbread came in a little cupcake liner and is one of the best I've had; not dry. Found our new spot for bbq."}
{"text":"Great Brisket! And the local javelina sauce was amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food not bad prices and not hot hot spices unless you want it so. Recommend chicken and ribs, cornbread crumbles and Cole slaw with green apples. Mm wish we lived closer by, would make regular out of me."}
{"text":"Yeah, boiii~ 

Delicious!!  We were hungry for bbq and being from out of town we were unsure of which establishment to go to. Both myself and my boyfriend were happy with the choice we made in going to Danky's. The gentleman who helped us figure out which beer and meal to get showed superb and genuine service. He was easygoing and just laid back. Good stuff. The gentleman manning the kitchen was kind and gracious and both were attentive thus making our experience with Phoenix bbq a pleasant one! 

We ended up getting the fatty brisket, 1/4 rib and sausage meal with a side of Mac & cheese, beans and a corn bread muffin. Brisket was not dry in the slightest, sausage had a good crisp to it and the ribs were falling off the bone tender and super tasty! Cornbread muffin was coo~  Ask for the spicy bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"Yeah for the small shops, brisket was good, beans were good but heavy, pulled pork was cold and dry and lacked flavor other than an odd chemical smoke hint.  Not cheap. . if you are dying for some BBQ and can not make it to another part of town then it will do but not the place that is a destination for amazing bbq"}
{"text":"Yes!! Love this place. The food is amazing and so is the service. Highly recommend. The ribs were killer, not dry but not fatty. The sides were SO good. Will definitely go back. Great \"comfort food\"."}
{"text":"Best BBQ! Had the 3 meat plate and sgared it with 4 people! All sides were deliciously spicy and right on target! Owner and every worker cared about each person's plate as it came to the table. They also asked us and each table how everything was! Will definitely come back and tell all of my friends!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night.  We ordered pork ribs, which were fall off the bone tender, but lacked depth of flavour.  Definitely had a real pink smokiness to the meat, but couldn't detect any underlying spice or heat.  The apple coleslaw was refreshing, and baked beans were good.  I would come back for a quick BBQ fix!"}
{"text":"I got the brisket. It was ok without sauce, not too much flavor. After I added some sauce it was fantastic. The apple pie was great and so was the ice cream, which goes without saying. I would definitely recommend it though"}
{"text":"Fries we absolutely over done, I mean to the edge of burned.  The chicken came to my wife still cold in the center.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people. Love that its family owned and that more people are learning about this place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check the place out - just needed some coleslaw to go with the ribs I had cooked. Wish I had skipped cooking ribs and just ordered from this place it - smelled so good!! everyone is very nice, enthusiastic, and customer focused- I'm coming back for the full experience! The slaw was killer"}
{"text":"Amazing. Doesn't look like much from the outside but incredible!  Our new favorite bbq now."}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue that my boyfriend and I have ever had!  The food is top-notch every time you won't get ribs like these in Arizona or anywhere else. I have yet to find  anything on their menu that I don't devour immediately. The staff is so friendly and always on their game. If somebody asked me what would you eat for your last meal I would choose Danky's. When friends come to visit I take them to Danky's every time."}
{"text":"6/21/15 - (First time)

Just stopped by here after a weekend trip. Having just gotten back into town, my friends and I were craving something tasty. We landed on the recently opened Danky's Bar-B-Q.

I think it was one of the best decisions I've ever seen one of my friends make. The food was absolutely incredible for the price. 

Three of us got the Curly Wolf BBQ Sandwich - Chopped brisket with their signature 'Javelina Sauce' (Arizona style spicy yet tangy green BBQ sauce) and I personally went with The Schmikey - Chopped beef brisket with BBQ sauce and melted cheddar on top.

After trying both sandwich's I came to the conclusion that I liked the Curly Wolf BBQ better but the cheddar cheese on The Schmikey made it just a step above. Next time I'm going to try the Curly Wolf with some added melted cheddar and I personally believe that it might be one of the best sandwich's I've ever had (prediction).

Overall, the prices are great ($5.50 - 7.75 per sandwich), service is good and the food is.. well.. dank.

6/25/15 - (Have eaten Danky's 4 times now)

Still just as good as the first time. The big Schmikey is to die for. The brisket is smoked for hours upon hours until perfection. The BBQ sauce is home-made, unique and delicious. 

Overall this place is worth every penny if not more!"}
{"text":"It's all about the sauce!  Although the pork and brisket are 'melt in your mouth', the sauces made the day.  The Danky Dank was delicious.  The relish sauce was excellent.  And the Curly Wolf, slathered in great green chile BBQ sauce was a taste treat.  The pork belly pit beans were scrumptious, beans and so much more.  We'll be makin this one of our regular stops when we get down to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm calling it three and a half stars on the food and 5 stars on the customer service. Staff was prompt and attentive. Love that they ask you if you want lean or fatty cuts on the brisket, which was prepared well. I went lean this time, but will definitely go for the fattier cuts on another trip. The pulled pork was just a touch dry and bland IMO, but that's what BBQ sauce is for, right? Must be the Carolina tendencies I have. Flip side to that statement, it was incredibly lean.  Mandatory that you get the beans, that side definitely stole the show for me. Portions are good, I could have finished the two meat plate but it would have required a nap afterward. Definitely looking forward to ribs and hot links next trip."}
{"text":"Never tried it. Walked in and took a chance... BRAVO!! Great, great BBQ. Loved the chicken and pork. Mac & Cheese is to die for. We'll done, DANKYs, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've had to update this review because while the food is good, the service is lacking. On two straight takeout orders, they have left out the cornbread. Their way of dealing with it? They offered extra cornbread next time. In addition to this second screwup, the coleslaw is very bland so I don't think there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome, the staff are real cool n friendly, and it's the only good bbq joint in north phx, highly recommend if you're looking for bomb eats"}
{"text":"Been waiting 20 years for a great BBQ place to open up. Finally, we have one. Ribs were amazing. And those beans. Crazy good flavor. Don't pass those up! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Was craving some good BBQ.  Saw some great reviews on Yelp so my wife and I decided to give it a shot.  The staff was super helpful and patient as we asked our fair share of questions.  We decided on the Brisket and Ribs with lots of fried okra.

The ribs were fall off the bone tender and sooooo good!  Some of the best I've ever had!  The brisket had the nice smoke ring and was super tender and flavorful.  The fried okra is also great!  If I weren't already full from all the meat and the multiple sides of okra, I would have considered ordering more okra.  :-)

I would highly recommend the green sauce / salsa.  It has a great balance of sweetness and punch of spiciness from the jalapenos.  I used this in conjunction with the regular bbq sauce and the two together was better than each individually.

Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great brisket sandwich with javelina sauce. Staff courteous and dining facility very clean."}
{"text":"Carried out from here.  Staff was great so was the food. We had boneless chicken breast, hotlinks and brisket.  Sides were coleslaw and mac and cheese.  All good!  We will be back...."}
{"text":"Anytime I try a BBQ joint for the first time, I always order the ribs.  That and brisket are a BBQ barometer.  I was very pleased to receive a half rack of beautifully done pork ribs.  Lightly seasoned (pork flavor speaks for itself) and smoked to perfection where the bone pulls away from the meat, but doesn't crumble apart.   I sampled the sauces prior to receiving my dinner (cornbread muffin, slaw, fries and killer baked beans included).  I was pleasantly surprised by the \"relish\" sauce, or \"javelina sauce\" as Patrick likes to call it.   The \"traditional\" sauce is very flavorful and resembles a sauce closer to a Carolina sauce or Tennessee sauce, not a \"ketchup sauce\".  Sauce is an accent, not a topping. 

My oldest boy had the brisket sandwich topped with slaw.  He devoured it and said I want to come here again.  My youngest son and wife had the pulled pork sandwich and loved it. Fries were absolutely perfect! Mac-n-cheese was a thumbs up.  

I have a smoker at home and have been making exactly what we ate for years.   I tend not to go out for BBQ a lot because I kick ass at my own hog.  I will definitely be skipping a few 8 hour smoker days this summer to sip some cold beer and enjoy some of Danky's BBQ perfection!"}
{"text":"Great service.  BBQ is middle of the road nothing great. It maybe the item I had.  Pricing is ok."}
{"text":"Tried Danky's just after it first opened and it was average at best.  Decor was non existent and bbq was not even close to Pork & Fork at the time.

But what we experienced yesterday was to die for!  My wife orders the large beef brisket sandwich with two half sides, and I had the classic pulled pork with slaw on top!!!   Both sandwiches were over flowing with delicious meat.  My pulled pork had crispy bits of skin throughout which was fantastic!  So the food was great but the new decor really transformed a former boring plain room to a total bbq experience.  From the smell of the burning wood once we got out of the car, to entering a totally remodeled interior.  Brick paneling covered the majority of walls along with fresh paint and nicely appointed tables and chairs.  It made for a perfect setting to enjoy really good bbq.
As for my old favorite bbq, Pork on a Fork, as my wife said recently, \"this place has gone down hill.\"  The new service line is slow, the sandwiches have dramatically shrunk and the overall experience is now at the most 2 stars.

So I ask you to experience Danky's and compare for yourself, I know that you won't be disappointed and you too will become a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Had Pulled Pork large size was very good and BBQ. Sauce was not over kill.
Would return for sure.
I would get the bun toasted next time. 
Cashier was very nice.Her name was Tori."}
{"text":"The traditional BBQ sauce is very good. Whatever you order, make sure you get the pork belly pit beans. They are awesome. Less than a week in business. Give them time to earn that fifth star."}
{"text":"A great little BBQ place! Ribs were moist, juicy, and came apart with a plastic fork. Coleslaw was amazing. They also have fried okra, which is awesome! This place is a very good deal with the Groupon! Our group of six ate two full slabs of ribs and sides for around 45 bucks. We were all stuffed and very satisfied. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area finally!!! Easily the best BBQ beans in town. I had the 1/4 slab + 2 meat combo! Pulled pork was great and the brocket have an amazing bark! Good portions too"}
{"text":"Actually, my second visit here.. Had Classic pulled pork sandwich.. Pork was very tender and slaw was good... But I thought that although the sauce was good... It was too tame for my taste.... Will visit again to try more!!"}
{"text":"I like the food it's good smoked BBQ.  BUTTTT.  The service and systems at the place are horrible.  Twice I have called to try and place an order over the phone once they never answered so I went in and they told me they were not answering the phone because they were busy despite the place being half empty.  The second time I called in they put me on hold for over 10 minutes. Once again I drove over to place an order. 1 customer is the establishment and I was on hold 10 minutes when I brought it to the person working attention he didn't apologize just told me he was short staffed, so I tried placing an order and the computer stopped working and they could only take cash.  Perfect so after trying to make an order for 30 minutes (calling, driving and in person) no food. This place also has had challenges getting my order correct almost every visit.  I guess I'll have to find a new BBQ place...."}
{"text":"First time here and the staff was super nice and helpful with the menu!  Gave my husband a taste of a side he asked about. The beef brisket is delicious!!!  Draft beer was cold!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ place I have been too in a very long time.  Nice people great service!!"}
{"text":"Drove right past this place a couple of times and didn't even know it was there. If your looking for great bbq this is the place. The food was very good, hot, and served on a serving tray. Definitely fit the character and charm of the place. Staff was very helpful when ordering, pleasant, attentive, and overall very welcoming. We had three different meats, four sides and enjoyed sharing everything. The ribs were awesome, the brisket was tender, the beans were flavorful but feel that the corn bread could have been served hot and maybe add some butter and honey. The only bad thing about this place is it's far away from our home. No matter, will definitely be making a special trip back."}
{"text":"Great quality and great value for money (as far as BBQ goes!). Ordered one of their family platters and was not disappointed by quality and portions. Their lean brisket was amazingly tasty without all the gristle.  Only problem is that now Danky's is the standard I judge other BBQ places by!"}
{"text":"The smoky aroma attracted me from the parking lot and I wasn't even there for food but I couldn't resist ordering. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the owner picks the playlist of songs playing in the background. Be prepared for a pop quiz on who's playing.

The brisket is lean and tasty, and I like their traditional sauce. If you like a little kick give the Javelina sauce a try. One thing for sure, you have to try the Pork Belly Pit Beans... OMgosh amazing!!

I haven't tried the Memaw's Michigan Farm Family home apple pie a la mode yet, but I'm coming back for it on a special trip next time."}
{"text":"This place totally satisfied my BBQ craving. I came with a group of 4, everyone tried something different and we all agreed it was delicious! I tried the chicken and brisket, and both were moist and flavorful (brisket being my fav!) As well as the mac and cheese and coleslaw, and boy did I leave satisfied and expecting to come back when I visit AZ again. My boyfriend said the ribs melted in his mouth, and the hot link was bomb. If you like sweet and spicy ask for the green BBQ sauce, and for those who like a good kick the hot BBQ is not too spicy but has a great flavor. The corn bread is complimentary, which I loved that it was included in my order. It's nice to have something sweet on the side. Don't let the outside of the location deceive you, because inside is great tasting food waiting to be tried!"}
{"text":"2 stars only because ambience and cleanliness. I took two bites of my sandwich. Inedible.  Mac and cheese was runny and straight out of a box. Bbq sauce was lacking and funky-almost a catsup & vinegar if combined. The fried okra was ok. My bf and I still hungry, left our meal and went to Pork on a Fork. I don't even know why we try anything else."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Classic Pork Sandwich hit the spot. BBQ sauce was right on and the pork is juicy and tender."}
{"text":"Went to Danky's for dinner tonight.  First of all, the outside smells were enough to lure in an even NOT-hungry person!!!  Yum!!!  We ordered: 1/4 ribs, fried chicken drums, pulled pork, and beef brisket (which we ordered lean, and I'm glad I did!  I don't like it fatty and this was perfect!) For sides we also tried: Mac and cheese, beans, and fries.  We really wanted to try the brisket chili and the gumbo but they were out of both.  Maybe next time!  Overall, the food was great!!  I loved the brisket and the ribs were (apparently) delicious .  The sides were all fairly bland, but the meats were definitely smoked to perfection!!  Will certainly be back again!!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ for a quick cheap meal. The classic pork with coleslaw is amazing and the fries are always perfectly cooked. The meat here is 5 stars! Employees are very nice. Just what we needed for this side of town."}
{"text":"This place knows how to do ribs and pulled pork! The fries and fried okra were great sides. I haven't done any of the desserts yet but only because I'm a entree kind of person- but I know I'm going to have to eat the apple pie sooner or later... This is just the place I needed."}
{"text":"For a casual BBQ place.....FANTASTIC! The ribs were fall off the bone tender. They offer three different and interesting sauces. The sides were basic but good (tried the coleslaw and Mac and cheese). The apple pie was one of the best I've had in AZ. Glad to see a new BBQ place nearby with really nice food."}
{"text":"Dankys is definitely the best Q I've tried in a while. We stopped in and got some meals to go. We ordered a full rack of ribs with meaty beans and mac n cheese as well as a briscuit and cheddar sandwich. Delicious. The ribs were well rubbed with an explosion of cracked pepper flavor. The sides were fresh and tasty. The coleslaw was a healthy version with green apples- not too shabby. That meat though! I'm still craving that delicious sweet, peppery meat- we'll have to be back!"}
{"text":"Surprised by this great restaurant! Ribs were delicious and falling off the bones. Brisket was moist. Chicken thigh was great... The beans were to die for. The two things that could have been better was the corn bread was too dry... And they burnt the sausage when they heated up in the skillet. Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place for the first time for late lunch. The BBQ was wonderful! I tried the pulled pork and got Mac n cheese as the side. He had the brisket and half sides of the coleslaw and potato salad. The gentleman at the front that took our order had suggested the brisket and was so friendly. He was spot on with the brisket, it was amazing! The pulled pork was delicious, however a little on the greasy side for me. The Mac n cheese is probably some of the best we've ever had! The coleslaw and potato salad were also great! Next time we'll have to try the French fries- they looked awesome! Overall a 5 star review for delicious food and wonderful service! We will definitely be back! It's so great to have a local spot that has friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"The food is good but my food both times visiting came to me cold and they missed my corn bread both times. Not sure if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the special #2 to feed 4 adults and 2 kids.  We enjoy leftovers so this was perfect.  The ribs are fall off the bone tender and the pork is the same.  Loved the beans, Mac n cheese, slaw and cornbread muffins.  Perfect comfort food takeout for our final vacation night.  Well definitely order it again on our next trip!"}
{"text":"I hate writing non positive reviews, and please don't get upset as I grew up in the bbq business and know the really good stuff.  When I order a $20 plate of Bbq I always hope for it to be good.  Had a rib combo with brisket, beans and fried okra.  The brisket had flavor and nice smoke rings but was a tad dry.  I didn't care for either one of the sauces I had.  The ribs were cold and really lacked flavor.  The beans seemed to be doctored up ranch style beans with pork belly, bbq sauce and onion added, just not good.  The fried okra was just ok, and the cornbread fell apart.  Sorry guys, I really wish you well, but there's way better choices in the valley for bbq done correctly as in Rudy's."}
{"text":"I was a fool for not coming here sooner. But I will learn from my mistake. I had the Curly Wolf sandwich - excellent. The sauce was a great mix of tangy and spicy. Next time, I'll wear my eating pants and try more."}
{"text":"Overall a little disappointed. We saw the good reviews so decided to try it out. The good news first- The beef brisket was some of the best that I've had - Great smoky flavor and very tender, but the pork was only so-so and the chicken was very dry.  I really liked the barbecue beans and the fried okra was good. My kids said the mac & cheese was pretty good....and they have eaten a lot of mac & cheese.  Not the worst barbecue I've had but definitely not the best.  Sidenote, people eating next to us said the barbecued ribs were really good. We did not try them."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!!   Javelina sauce is delish!!!   And sea salt caramel fries for dessert were perfect!!"}
{"text":"Brisket is a real star here. Just two weeks ago I was in central Texas and visited five famous bbq joints. Danky's brisket is at that same high level. I normally prefer ribs to brisket, so I got a combo plate with a few ribs, slaw, fried okra, and the brisket with some bonus burnt ends. Okra was great, slaw not so much, baby back ribs were in an overly sweet sauce that was generously poured everywhere. The rib meat was tender but somehow lacking character. Slaw was vinegar based, but too mild, needs more zip. 

Service was super friendly. I'll definitely be back for more brisket, and I'll give the rest of the menu a try. Serious, serious brisket."}
{"text":"I don't want to knock a small business because I appreciate those, and I like non-chainy restaurants. This place is just OK.  Wasn't bad, but definitely didn't blow my socks off.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a side of beans.  The beans had a heavy BBQ sauce flavor to them, they were very rich which made me not want to eat a lot. I did like that they put the pulled pork in there, so that was good, but I just didn't love them.  The sandwich kinda left something to be desired.  Not very much flavor meat wise or sauce wise and the bun was soggy from the juice in the pulled pork :(  soggy bread is gross....So eat fast.
I debated on ordering the apple pie, but decided against it because I didn't really know what to expect.
Not a home run, but if you're hungry you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"There is no other place in the entire Valley like danky's! The food is unlike any other barbecue place I've ever! Falls off the bone smoked to Perfection there's sauce is legendary and their pit beans are to die for!

Don't pass by this place! Go get Stanky at Danky's!!"}
{"text":"Danky's is one of our favorite BBQ spots in all of Scottsdale/Phoenix. It's a family-run establishment that is so unassuming from the outside, but it stand-out in terms of food.

First off, let me preface this by saying that I appreciate when a restaurant is kind, patient and willing to help me navigate the menu to find gluten-free, dairy-free options. The team at Danky's has been extremely helpful and patient, and I've found that all of their meats are gluten-free, which has been a game-changer for us when we want to order take-out.

I usually get 1/4 lb of brisket (lean), and 1/4 lb of pulled pork and it's the perfect weekend take-out option for us! The meat is so juicy, tender and flavorful, and I just adore their meats. BONUS - They have a gluten-free option for BBQ sauces too.

Gluten-free Yelpers: I highly recommend Danky's. If you're nice, polite and explain your allergies/sensitivities to the team, they should be more than willing to help.

Give it a go!!"}
{"text":"The meat is done well, and the service is friendly.  I did not care for the barebones venue.  The coleslaw is a winner because I like vinegar based dressing.  The Danky Dank featured relish based sauce, a first for me.  I spend  a great deal of time in small town Texas.  This BBQ could hang."}
{"text":"Brisket was great as was the pulled pork. Had the cole slaw, great taste as was the mac n cheese. Next time I will try beans.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to bbq for Memorial day weekend.  Place smells amazing... (shocker right?) We tried the following

Lean brisket; just okay 3 out 5.

Pulled Pork; nothing great little dry 3 out of 5
Chicken breast good 4 out of 5

Mac n cheese; not super flavorful but prepared well 3.5 out of 5

Andouille Sausage; 5 out of 5 perfect

Corn muffin; awful jiffy box 2 for $1 @ grocery store.  Compare to Bobby Q corn muffin this is a 0 out of five.  

Bbq sauce; Seriously good.  Some of the best I've had. 5 out 5

Wish they had burnt ends. You pay extra for Meat combos if you want brisket as a meat  Really? isn't that a meat most peeps judge a bbq place on?   Real good service.  Staff honest and helpful"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ I guess, but definitely not 4.5 stars worthy. I wasn't blown away by any single item and I think I've tried just about every type of meat they have. It was my last day in Phoenix and I wanted to have BBQ and this restaurant was the second highest rated that I found (#1 Spot: Little Miss BBQ is closed on Sundays). Since it's the only chance I would get to ever come here, I ordered the ribs, pulled pork, andouille sausage, fatty brisket, and chicken leg. I wanted to try it all and I guess I'm glad I did because I wasn't stuck with too much of any one type of mediocre meat. I would say the fatty brisket was the best thing I've tried but even then, it wasn't anywhere near the best I've had. 

As for sides, I wasn't too crazy about the fried okra. It was still a little slimey inside. The mac and cheese wasn't thick or creamy. And the potato salad was ok. 

Javelina sauce was probably my most favorite thing here. 

The staff was nice so I didn't really feel bad about having a super mediocre BBQ lunch. At least there was good company."}
{"text":"Excellent selections of BBQ sauce. I'm a big fan of their pork and brisket. 

Danny's is deff a good place to have a quality BBQ dinner."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to check out this BBQ place out for a while and finally decided to try them out before doing a Wally World shopathon next door. You can definitely smell the smokey goodness from the parking lot and it even may make your leg tingle like it did mine. Nice!

This strip mall location has had quite a few different types of food joints including the last one that was hot dogs. We're so glad to see a new BBQ restaurant near our house and I'm thoroughly convinced these guys will have great success with their delicious food and their excellent service.

Ordered a Big Brisket Sandwich called the Curly Wolf and was not disappointed. The brisket was very tender and it had a nice smokey flavor with the Javelin Sauce kicking things up a notch. My wife went with the Classic Pork Sandwich which comes with their traditional BBQ Sauce and some of their top secret Cole Slaw. She was very happy with her choice and told me several times how good it tasted.

We also ordered some side dishes to go along with our sandwiches. Checking in with Yelp instantly gave us a FREE standard side so we picked the Fried Okra. We also tried the Southern Style Potato Salad and had to check out a Hot Link with their Hot Spicy BBQ Sauce.

Everything was super delicious and the prices are very reasonable. They have a custom built smoker that is better than the ones I've always seen and it did a great job at keeping the meat moist and tender.

Service was very friendly and most helpful. This is a local Mom and Pop owned and operated place and that is very important to me. I was very excited to meet and talk with Patrick the owner. We spent a good amount of time talking about smoking meats and making sausage and favorite techniques and suppliers of special ingredients. This really made my day since making sausage, smoking and curing meats is one of my longtime hobbies.

Can't wait to come back and try out more of their Signature Sandwiches and also check out their yummy Big Dank Plates. The plates offer a bigger selection of meats and they come in 3 sizes. Plenty of options at this place and they are more than happy to combine and customize whatever tickles your fancy. Just tell them what you want.

Just good old school hard work and effort at this restaurant with secret family recipes and a lot of pride. Come on over and give them a visit and you will see what all the noise is about. This is going to be on our new rotation for yummy BBQ as well. SCORE!

{"text":"I love good BBQ and I've always had trouble finding really good BBQ in North Phoenix  -  Not anymore!  Danky's is really great BBQ!  The brisket absolutely melts in your mouth!  The ribs, sauces, and sides are all wonderful!  The owner Patrick is a great guy and such a positive addition to our community!  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Pretty much steady as she goes the 2nd time around. They added a lunch special, but it actually is only a free drink if you buy a sandwich and a side. Still not a fan of most of the meats just sitting in metal tins, but I did hear the guy lightly chopping my chicken breast for the sandwich. I know of no barbeque style that eminates from Michigan, so these guys are clearing winging it or there is some famous Q up there that has been a hidden secret. The mild BBQ sauce is tasty though, but hoping they add turkey and make it a full service meat factory. 
   Also why would you have the girl at the register leave the register to drop the frozen fries in the deep fryer. If you want to keep her busy, then have her cut your fries fresh and give the customers something better. Stop hiding the BBQ sauces also - break them out so we can try everything."}
{"text":"After getting on yelp for a new BBQ place to try, we decided to try Danky's. Immediately upon entering we were greeted with genuine enthusiasm and excitement. I ordered the brisket, my fianc√© ordered the chicken plate, and my son got a pulled pork kids meal. IT WAS ALL FREAKING DELICIOUS! The portions were great, the service was prompt, and the food was fabulous. What I loved most about Dankys with the service. It's hard to get good customer service anymore and everyone in this place was truly happy to be there, hardworking, and just extremely genuine individuals. It almost seemed like you were just eating at a friends restaurant. We really loved everything about this place. Including the comfortable environment. We will definitely be making Dankys a monthly thing. After going out to dine lately and being disappointed time and time again with either he service or the meal, Dankys was a breath of fresh air that people do still care about their business, their food, and their customers. Super pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"Very good. Ribs and brisket 5 stars. The pulled pork was a little dry. If you like a strong mustard potato salad thats what they have. Pork pit beans are great. Mac and cheese good. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a good BBQ joint. All the meats were tender and tasty! We tried all 4, chicken, pork, brisket and the links. We have been back a few times, and their bone in, skin on chicken thigh is our new favorite!!! The meat is just amazing there!"}
{"text":"So good. This is a small place where everyone is important. The food is great. Even though there isn't much seating it's fine because the portions for carry out are great."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food, great service! Had the ribs, pulled pork and beef brisket. I can't wait to go back. We also tried the green apple slaw, really good stuff!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ in a small spot. 4 different sauces - our favorites were the spicy BBQ and the javelina with green chili. The fatty brisket was great- they also have a lean for all you lean machines. The fries and Mac n cheese were good. Skip the fried okra.  At this point Dankys would be a 3, but the service was top notch, the tall bald bearded cutie at the counter was so polite and helpful. Dankys was having a promotion for charity today for Phoenix Children's Hospital - free chicken n pork BBQ sandwiches n sides with any donations going to PCH, 20% of all sales and all tips going to PCH.  Kudos to the owner for supporting children in need.  Tip: they serve alcohol which was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good! Fantastic food. Family feel. Classic BBQ ambiance. Great service. Clean. The owner Pat: very hands on and all over the place, cooking up amazing creations, serving customers and stirring up good conversation. Oh and good prices. Awesome local business that genuinely cares about its food and customers. A real gem."}
{"text":"Awsome! Was pretty much how my family descibed the food tonight. couldn't quite go to the fifth star since we wanted brisket and they were out before 5pm. Maybe once we get some of the brisket too."}
{"text":"I had a brisket sandwich, I asked that my brisket not be chopped, they were accommodating, the fries and ocra are great, Dusty had the schmikey chopped brisket, he said he enjoyed his, we shared the fries and ocra, over all a good food experience, I will return, I wish they had more classic drink choices, old fashioned root beer, homemade tea and lemonade, there is only a drink fountain with the standards, the beer is cans only"}
{"text":"One of the better BBQ spots in Phoenix and earned the recognition they have received. Been here several times and all the meals have been good. Being an avid grilled/smoker i would like to think I can pick good BBQ. With that said, I have sampled all the meats and by far the best thing is the smoke fried chicken drumsticks there. They have great smokey flavor and frying keeps the meat juicy and the skin crispy. You can't go wrong with the beans and Mac and cheese as sides. The pork (ribs and pulled) is very good as well."}
{"text":"Below average bbq and poorly operated I've eaten at some of the best bbq places in the country unfortunately Dickeys is even better than this place"}
{"text":"Stopped by after late day At work.  After reading reviews had to give Dankys s try, liked it was local.  Smoke their meats on the premises.   Super clean and friendly staff.  Owner on premises, do a great takeout business.  They have about 6 tables and a tv in dining area.  

Got a sandwich with slaw and pulled pork with javalena sauce and beans for takeout.  Food and service are the great.     Beans are worth the visit and homemade.   Great homemade sauces.  

They have a catering menu or you can order the meats by the pound.   Worth a visit. 

For the Michiganders they have BetterMade, Vernors and Faygo."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good barbecue place for a long time now. I personally don't care fo fatty meat and they have that option.  It was lean, but at same time extremely tasty!  Helpings are big but was glad to have some take-home. It tasted great a few days later. Although they didn't have a sweet barbecue sauce, they did have a milder one for me and then there's this relish type sauce that is interesting and really good.  I also like my meat well done and they gave me the ends of the shredded beef. That and the chicken (breast/all white meat which I prefer) were what I had and they were perfect! Husband had the pork and he loved it.   

Can't wait to go back. Highly recommend!

The next time I need catering, I'm using them!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service and food are amazing. I would recommend to anyone looking for excellent BBQ."}
{"text":"Great brisket, fair to midlen pork ribs, coffee shop environment, inexpensive. Try it I liked it."}
{"text":"Really like their classic pork sandwich with beans. It's always good and the service is great."}
{"text":"It was 8:30 PM on a Thursday and my husband and I needed some grub. Our choices were Rubio's, Wendy's, and DANKY'S!! Of course we chose to eat local and i'm so glad that we did! 

I ordered their brisket with split sides of potato salad and green apple coleslaw. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! The meat was incredible! We asked to try all of their sauces which I highly recommend doing because they're so fabulous (and different!). My favorite was their spicy sauce but my husband loved their chutneys. 

My husband ordered the pulled pork and mac & cheese which was also a major winner. The mac was SO good (and not mushy like at a lot of BBQ places). I will definitely get that next time! :) 

We will absolutely be back when we're in the area again!! Thanks for a great experience, Danky's!"}
{"text":"Been around the block as far as barbecue is concerned. This place was top notch great food great people reasonably priced and they have beer"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! The salted caramel fries were amazing! 
Brisket, the ribs, and BBQ beans were all amazing too! Friendly and helpful staff as well"}
{"text":"This was by far best BBQ I've had in a long time. My husband had the brisket and I had the pork. It was very lean, tender and delicious. Their sides are also very good and they make their corn bread fresh onsite. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I definitely suggest that you try this place, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Had Danky's cater my companies lunch and there food was amazing.  I am pretty finicky when it comes to BBQ and will say this was hands down one of our best lunches as of yet. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"A new BBQ joint in the neighborhood - hurray!  This is a review based on trying exactly one thing on the menu so far - I'll try to get back and update this.

I ordered the Curly Wolf BBQ Sandwich for lunch today - the young lady at the register said this was one of her two favorite sandwiches.  

This is a chopped brisket with their \"Javelina Suace\" - this is advertised as spicy yet tangy - and spicy was confirmed when ordering.

It was very tasty, but not really spicy, so it didn't completely agree with my expectation that it would raise some sweat on my brow.  

Not fair to hold that against it.  As I said, it was very tasty.  The meat was also tasty.  One of the other guys ordered the Danky Dank (pork with a relish based bbq sauce).  He said it was pretty good, but liked their classic sauce better.  He got a taste of the classic sauce from the other guy, who ordered a brisket plate.  I didn't try any of this, but it had a nice smoke ring, and he assured me it was tasty, and that the sauce was also good.

Definitely planning to head back and try some more items (I noticed they have hot links  :-))

Good place, friendly folks - give it a shot!"}
{"text":"BBQ is a big deal for us. We've eaten here a couple of times. The food is good but they could do a little more to make it better. Their sandwiches have plenty of meat but the buns are always stone cold. Hint - by a bread warmer/steamer. It will make a huge difference. Second, customers can always add salt to your fries, they can't take it off. Ease up a bit on the salt. Lastly, if you are going to serve macaroni and cheese- do it right. Your's is the worst. Noodles with cheese sauce poured on them is beyond acceptable. Try baking a pan of it. Even if it gets a little dry, customers would be much happier.  

Your meats are awesome - just need some work in the sides and such."}
{"text":"Came here after reading about Danky's in Phoenix Magazine. I would give it 5 stars but the smokers inside make it feel humid and I always walk out feeling sticky. The food is delicious and I find that it is good portions. It is my go to spot when I am in the mood for BBQ."}
{"text":"What a great find!

We were in the area and craving bbq so we stopped at this little place which is in a Walmart plaza. It's small with just 6 or 7 tables inside and some patio seating. Our timing was perfect because if we had arrived 5 minutes later we would have had to get our order to go. There are some paper menus at the counter where you place your order and then you find your own seat.

I ordered the two item plate with chicken breast and lean brisket. It came with your choice of sides and a cornbread muffin. It also had a large cup of a sweet and slightly spicy bbq sauce which I dipped everything in from the meat to the fries. The meat was delicious and very tender. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich which came with coleslaw and a pickle and he also got some Mac and cheese. We ordered soda (the only size choice is a massive cup) but they do have beer.

The prices were very reasonable, the staff was friendly. I only hope they move to a big place as people were staring at us waiting to give up our seats so we couldn't linger."}
{"text":"Very good bbq and service and you have a great place to eat. I would eat here over Famous Daves anytime."}
{"text":"Don't let the size of the place deter you, their bbq is as good as any larger restaurant - and the staff is a total delight.  Huge portions of fall off the bone ribs, not too sweet but not too hot BBQ sauce and really well done sides.  And, the price is terrific, too.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the pork sandwich with coleslaw.  The meat was tender and the coleslaw was one of the best I have had in the valley. Unfortunately there was not a lot of sauce on the sandwich and there was just a dollop of coleslaw. Mac and cheese and potato salad was good"}
{"text":"Great brisket (I had a mix of fatty, regular and YUMMY burnt ends)  The bbq beans and corn muffin were excellent but oh my...the homemade apple pie is marvelous! Served with vanilla ice cream, quite a treat. Love the low-key, casual atmosphere and can't wait to go back to try their other menu items. Nice work Matt and Patrick!!"}
{"text":"Danky's is one of the best barbecue places I've been to near paradise valley. It has your typical meats as options - pulled pork, brisket, etc. with a large menu of southern-style sides. Fries, fried okra, macaroni and chrese, potato salad and even meaty sides like chili were on the menu. There are a few sandwiches that sound pretty appetizing, and each can be customized too. The best option, though is the plate - you get to pick a few meats, a side and corn bread as well. This is an excellent option for lunch due to its lightning-quick serving speed, excellent meat quality and variety of options."}
{"text":"I would post a picture but the food didn't last long enough. Customer service was great, as was the food. The owner is friendly and knowledgeable and his passion for meat really shows. While it's different in style from what i normally think of in barbeque, it was delicious and we will definitely come back often."}
{"text":"I am thrilled that there is a new place in the neighborhood and am truly hoping that it does well.  I will definitely try it again because I see the potential and think I may have ordered the wrong thing, but it is all I can review.  My daughter had the BBQ chicken sandwich with cole slaw and she liked it.  She said, \"It's no Honey Bears, but very good\".  

I had their special Dank Sandwich.  The nice cashier repeatedly said to me when I asked about the sauce that it was a \"relish sauce\".  I guess I should have ordered something different, but I usually like to try a specialty.  The meat was tender and delicious, but it was not  BBQ sauce at all--it was like straight relish.  Don't get me wrong, I love relish so I figured it was infused into the BBQ sauce and would just give it some flavor.  I ate half of it and that was enough because the relish overload was just too much. I also thought if they named a sandwich after their business, it must be a favorite.  It is not something I will ever order again.   

Sides we tried:  mac and cheese, cole slaw, and beans.  The beans were delcious and I would definitely get them again.  Mac and cheese was bland, but ok to eat.  Nothing special.  The cole slaw was also fine, but nothing special.  We would have tried the Apple Pie, but they were out of them.  

All in all, I will try it again.  I read all the good reviews, and I think i will try some different items.  I HATE to give this place a low rating, but I am hoping that next visit will be better.  The service was excellent and the people are friendly.  It is also priced right.  I will definitely edit this review if I have a different impression."}
{"text":"the rib meat literally slides off the bone. so delicious. excellent Cole slaw as well. love the addition of the apple"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best BBQ I've had! The staff - and I am assuming the owner was very helpful, friendly and welcoming. If you're looking for a local place with great food at reasonable prices and good portions- this is the place!! 
\"This is the best BBQ I've ever had!\" 15 year old boy!  that's huge for a teenager"}
{"text":"Great little place. Staff is always friendly & the food is very good! Grab a cold one & watch the game with some good barbecue yum! Only thing I wish the portions were a little heftier, but I'm kind of a hefty guy lol"}
{"text":"We like it! My husband devoured a rib and chicken plate. The chicken was good and the ribs were tender and fell off the bone. It comes with fries and coleslaw and beans. You must have the javelina sauce, on your fries, brisket, etc. So good! People are nice and happy to take care of you. I would suggest that they let folks pick their own 2 sides with a rib plate, even though the fries and coleslaw are good, I like mac and cheese more."}
{"text":"I went in there on a Sunday afternoon (between dinner and lunch) after going to GNC next door. The place was dead, but that was fine by me. Great canned beer selection, and a menu that is definitely geared to their strong points.

I had the Caveman platter ( I go to BBQ places for the meat, not a sandwich) and had brisket, chicken thighs and pork. I also got the \"Daily Greens\" which I assumed would be collard, mustard etc. but turned out to be deliciously crispy fried okra.

I also had a side of smoke pork belly baked beans and some New Belgium Fat Tire to wash it down.

First off, the brisket was DELICIOUS. You can tell that the brisket and beans are going to be what they're known for. The brisket was just the right amount of fatty and moist, with that tell-tale pink smoke ring around the edges and the beans were rich, smoky and full of pork belly.

The chicken thighs were very moist and smoky as well (like they'd come out on your own grill at home, but better). I've never had smoked thighs chopped up like that, and they were fantastic.

As previously stated, the okra was crispy and delicious, with not too much breading.

The pork was probably my least favorite, but still better than most pork loin I've had. Definitely not traditional pulled pork, but would be amazing on a sandwich, or with a sliced of bread and dowsed in sauce.

The traditional BBQ sauce was ON POINT. Smoky, sweet, tangy and spicy.

The meal was finished with a cupcake sleeve full of moist cornbread to sop up the BBQ sauce and juices.

The staff was very welcoming, and even though there wasn't many people there, it was a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Left happy and satisfied. Exactly what I expected in terms of portion size and beyond expectation in terms of flavor. Great place only thing that could be better would be the price, reasonable but still a bit up there but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My wife and I were across town and came across this little place. We were greeted with a big smile and a \"How ya doin'?\" when we walked in. The brisket is absolutely outstanding! And the BBQ sauces, along with the Javelina Salsa are delicious! And its priced right, too! We will definitely be making another trip up here to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Seriously the best BBQ ever!!!
Staff is super friendly. Great service! Great food! I come here everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, ribs and pulled pork were great, juicy and tender. Will def be back."}
{"text":"I went today with a friend.  Between us we had pulled pork, lean brisket, hot link and andouille sausage, beans, coleslaw, corn muffin.  It was all exceptionally good.  The sauces were amazing and the coleslaw was made without sugar and with apples.  The food was amazing and far superior in quality and price to another place I had been going to.  I've eaten great BBQ in the south, Texas and in South Los Angeles and this was the best!  I expect I'll be a regular from now on.  And, Cole who was at the register and took our orders could not have been nicer and more competent."}
{"text":"We visited a couple years back when they first opened and frankly, kinda forgot (it was a so-so experience).   Out of the blue, we decided to give it another try tonight and holy crap!

We ordered a sampler meal (Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork + sides / cornbread).   For just about $50 out the door, we fed our family of four have plenty of leftovers for a late night snack.

The ribs we classic, fall-off-the-bone, low/slow BBQ.   Just awesome.   The rub might be a bit peppercorn heavy for some, but it worked for us.

The pulled pork was delicious.  Tender and flavorful (w/o sauce) with plenty bark bits mixed in (something I love).

The star of the show was the brisket.  Classic.  Fork tender, but not falling apart.  Flavored just right (simply seasonsed) with plenty of smoke coming through.  My 9-year old went to town... which is almost a tear-jerker for mom & dad who have hard time convincing her to eat any kind of protein in normal quantities.

We've been missing out for a while - and really, have sometimes griped about not having a good BBQ joint near by, but now we know!"}
{"text":"Just picked up dinner. OMG! We had brisket, ribs, hot links, baked beans and potato salad. The brisket was absolutely  delicious.The ribs fell off the bone. The hot links never made it home because we ate them in the car. Patrick and his crew are hard working and very passionate about their bbq. Give them a try. I think you'll really enjoy."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  I had the Curly Wolf,  which has juicy brisket and \"Javelina\" sauce (relish that is mildly spicy and sweet).  I am not much of relish guy, but it was great.  The fries were hot and tasty. The corn bread had a nice sweet taste as well.

The environment is pretty cool.  Brick walls,  ability to see some of the kitchen,  and friendly staff.   

Being a BBQ establishment, it's important to comment on the meat. As said before,  the brisket was juicy,  but also had a great smokey taste.  Also worth noting others had chicken legs that looked tempting if I wasn't wanting a sandwhich.  

All in all,  very positive experience, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is the best around great portions and sauces. Small quaint but so yummy and filling. Will come back when n the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Danky's is one of the best Yelp finds we've made for BBQ.  We've been there a number of times and Danky's does disappoint.  As many have mentioned the ribs and brisket are amazing. The meat falls off the bone!   They have become one of our favorite spots in the Valley for BBQ. The staff are also super friendly and very helpful with recommendations and great service."}
{"text":"Had the Brisket sandwich, the smoke flavor was delicious and was a generous portion.

In response to Larry C's review, the price is actually lower if you compare it to local BBQ joints. I wouldn't expect you to know that though, considering you don't even know how to spell Brisket slick...#realmenknowbrisket"}
{"text":"I dusted off my trusty Yelp App and looked for a new place to try since I was in a rut by going to the same places. Even though Danky's is a bit of a hike for me they earned a spot in my regular rotation.

I tried the Big Brisket sandwich with a fountain drink and the fried Okra. They have two sizes for the sandwich, Regular and Big. The Okra was complimentary since I used the Yelp check in offer for a free side, which is normally $1.99. My total damage came out to $11.36.

I could smell the BBQ as soon as I got out of my car. The place has about 5 or 6 large tables and serves beer and hard drinks. There are two large flat screen TV's and each end of the restaurant and a couple more above the kitchen area. This place is located in The Big Lots plaza right next to Petco. I spent a few minutes tooling around various parking lots before I found this place.

Now on to the most important part, the food. The sandwich was Big as advertised, no girly man need apply. And what was outstanding about this BBQ Sandwich is that the BBQ sauce was not squeezed on to the top of the meat, it was incorporated into the meat during preparation. I can go through a whole list of adjectives to describe the BBQ, but I'll say say that I had to stop myself from inhaling it in two minutes and slow down and enjoy it. I haven't even gotten to the fried Okra. Again, another outstanding morsel of food.

To say I'm a fan of this place is an understatement. Danky, You Rock!"}
{"text":"Our dinner at Danky's tonight was delicious. The ribs were succulent, and just fell off the bone. The beans are out of this world. My husband and I are vacationing this week from Orange County, CA, and enjoyed the entire meal."}
{"text":"\"There are very few lunches that I would drive from the Carefree area to Tatum & Shea for, but lunch at Dankey's BBQ is worth it! Took that trip today and had a spectacular lunch at Dankey's. The \"Curley wolf\" sandwich was fantastic! The brisket is amazing! And the \"javelina sauce\" has enough spice to tingle your palette, and compliments the brisket. I wish Dankey's had a location closer to Northeast Scottsdale. If they did, I'd eat there as often as possible!\""}
{"text":"We tried the ribs, pulled pork and brisket. They were all delicious. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Had my first experience with Danky's tonight. I was picking up Rubios for my wife, but didn't feel like that. The BBQ smell lofted through the parking lot, and pulled me by the nose to a big sign that said BBQ.  I walk in into what doesn't look like much, simple counter and a few booths. But none of that matters because that smell greets you with a big smile. There was another big smile behind the counter, gentleman greeted me and gave me the rundown on the menu. I ordered some ribs, links sausages, and multiple sides.  As I was sitting waiting it was apparent that most of the clients were regulars, which says a lot about a business. 
I get my food and head to the house. I resist the temptation to sneak a snack till I get home. Not easy I will tell you. 
I unwrapped the ridiculous amount of food I ordered, and dove into the ribs. WOW!!. They were amazing, great tenderness, and a sauce to die for. My son walks by and says what do you have there. Oh yeah, some of this is for you. 
I make him a plate, enjoying the links and sausages as make him a plate, also very good.  10 min later he is back. \"do you have more ribs\", \"These are the best ribs I have ever had\".  My thoughts exactly. The beans pair with it perfectly, they are excellent as well. Don't get fries to go, they don't travel well:)
Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.  
See you soon!!"}
{"text":"Great little place! Had no idea it was there and while walking to get to Petco we saw the sign and stopped in. I had the Danky Dank, which is their sweet relish BBW with pulled pork and my husband had the brisket with the javelina BBQ sauce. Both were delicious! We both had fries but I wish I had gotten beans and coleslaw instead. The fries were eh and just your basic frozen french fries. The service was awesome and Patrick was super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today.  It was okay. I would've given it more stars if I had gotten what I has actually ordered. I was very disappointed when I got my sandwich home and it wasn't at all what I ordered.  I was also surprised by the size, I had asked for a large & it didn't look very large at all. I hate to see what the small looks like. The one good thing about this place is their bbq sauce, it was delicious.  I probably wouldn't go back just for bbq sauce though. 
I updated this review and changed my 3 star review to 5 bc the owner reached out, and I think they may have had a bad/really busy night. Also, I think I was given someone else's order by mistake.  I will be giving this bbq joint another chance!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ,and hoping they get better. 

Had the 1 meat plate today with brisket and a side of beans. Didn't opt for a drink as I saw they had bag-in-box tea vs. freshly brewed tea. That's always a big strike in my book.

The brisket is decent. Would like to see more bark on it but the smoke flavor was good. It was pretty tender and moist. Better than some, not as good as some. I will go back for it but I prefer some of the competitors. 

Baked beans were great and show a nice touch of a good unique recipe. These are not straight from the can beans and are a great side item for any dish.

Cornbread was fine but didn't come with any side of butter, which I thought was a bit odd. I didn't see any with the other condiments and utensils either.

I appreciate that it's a BBQ joint with one or two sauces and not a place with ten sauces for every taste. Come up with a great sauce and feature it proudly (I understand two sauces too, sweet and spicy). Ten sauces means you just don't like any of them.

It's a young restaurant and I suspect it's going to get better and better. Great pricing on the menu, very aggressive."}
{"text":"We were in the area for an appointment and checked Yelp for a recommendation. Danky's was at the top of the list. Our wonderful experience began at the register while ordering. The owner gave us a tour of the menu and offered guidance. My husband had the 2 meat platter(brisket and ribs) with beans and mac and cheese as his sides. I had only the brisket and mac n cheese. We were not disappointed. The brisket was moist and tender. The ribs were equally delicious!  The mac n cheese was creamy and the beans (a recipe from the owner) were outstanding!! Corn bread rounded out the meal.  We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to go and got a Danky Dank pulled pork with their special relish sauce and slice of apple pie.  Both were very good. Pulled pork was very moist and had great flavor.  Bun was good.  Pie tasted home-made.  Definitely will go back to try the brisket."}
{"text":"Just tried Dankys BBQ for the first time & it was not only the best BBQ I've had in Phoenix but honestly the best BBQ I have ever had!!!! The meat litterally fell of the bone before I could even get it to my mouth  every last thing on the menu was unbelievable. And if the food wasn't good enough the staff was such a delight! They were so knowledgable & helpful... I truly felt at home! Thank you Dankys for an awesome expierance tonight & the best meal I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The food was definitely 5 stars. We tried as much as we could in one visit including the ribs, brisket and their homemade sausage. All some of the best I have had. The setting was ok and the service was friendly and proactive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tonight my bf and I ordered out from Dank's and omg it was amazing! Honestly some of the best BBQ I've ever had! We will definitely be ordering from them again!!!"}
{"text":"This BBQ is the Dankest. It is hands down the best BBQ in Arizona. Everything is good. I recommend getting a group platter a taste of everything. Even my my kids love it!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered our Thanksgiving turkey from Danky's and WOW!  It was absolutely amazing!  We've never had anything so delicious!  It had a slightly smoked flavor, but was tender and moist!  We  had leftovers and were so sad when it was all gone.  If you are looking for a catered meal--or your next holiday turkey, give this a try!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times already .best bbq I ever had. The food is the subject here .not how fancy of a place it is. 
Try the chicken bbq ...also amazing. I a regular now"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch before the crowd. I thought it was really good Texas barbecue even though I'm more of a Kansas City barbecue guy.I got the two meat plate of a chicken thigh and the brisket. He gave me both the flat portion of the brisket and the point (apparently juicer and fattier). I liked both, but I'll go flat next time. The thigh was big, crispy and good. 
Number 2 in the city, not so sure about that. I'm happy to say I need to do a lot more investigating around town."}
{"text":"I'm just happy to finally have a BBQ restaurant close enough to walk to, and they serve awesome food, perfect servings, and the service was great too, I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch and it was amazing!  You can tell the minute you open the door that you are in for a treat because the smells were heavenly.  I had the 3 meat combo with andouille sausage, pulled pork, brisket and then the baked beans and cornbread muffin on the side and I added a side of mac and cheese.  They gave me a rib to try and it was awesome!  Highly recommend this place.  Service was great, restaurant was clean, and food was second to none.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best BBQ I've had since I moved from the Midwest 3 years ago. So glad my search is over!!! The traditional BBQ sauce and beans are the best!!!!:) great and friendly service with the small and personal feel... Just like back home:) can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"We love the BBQ and okra!  Not much seating inside so be prepared to get your order to go or share a table with others."}
{"text":"A go to Bbq place. Good food and friendly. Close to house and always ready in a few minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket plates. Good service. Got some takeout too which was well prepared. 
Going back to try the other options soon. 
Can't go wrong with the brisket."}
{"text":"Meet the Super cool owner, that guy loves bbq and I love his bbq. If you want something new and different I would recommend the salted Carmel fries."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'll be back. Love the BBQ. I had the brisket and the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"This is a nice little BBQ place. The smoked brisket was excellent, good smoke ring and flavor. The cornbread was stale and not really edible, and I would have preferred it to be served with sandwich bread (it's a Texas thing). Also I would have liked to have tried some of their other sauces, the one (which I had to ask for) they gave me was too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"Great food. Coming here from Texas, I am always looking for a great BBQ place. The place is small and not a lot of seating but lots of business. Having an open kitchen is always great to see how things work in the backend. This is a small business and the owner actually works in the kitchen. The portions are large and full of flavor. I definitely recommend the palace and will be a regular."}
{"text":"Danky's has fall off the bone ribs. I've always heard the phrase fall off the bone ribs and it really does seem like a banal statement, especially since people use it for restaurants that done have fall off the bone ribs. This place literally has FALL OFF THE BONE RIBS. Pick the rib up by the bone and the meat comes right off. This place has amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing ribs! Second time I've had this place and the second time I was blown away"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to pick up dinner for later.  No customers in at the time, but quickly filled up while I ordered. Went with a pound of brisket, 1/2 lb of hot link, 2 orders of fried okra, and trio of sauces.  The order took about 10 minutes to prep. The guy who gave me my order explained the meats and sauces.  He was especially proud of the day's brisket.  So, an hour later and I'm ready to eat.  Everything was still nice and warm.  The brisket was excellent and had a great mix of smoke/rub flavor.  Hot links were not my style, but my wife liked them.  I'm a TX hill country sausage snob.  Sauces were off the chain and really something different. I found myself mixing them to find the perfect combination of gelatinous/sweet/spicy/chunky perfection.  Good job Danky's, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful, welcoming staff. Love the BBQ brisket sandwich and Mac & Cheese. Ate it all! There were 6 of us and we will ALL be back. Just needs to be a bit bigger!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix. Been here a few times and will continue to go if the wasteline allows it. Get the Curly Wolf with the relish style Javelina Sauce. Traditional is good too with slaw on top. The open kitchen will have you smelling like smoked BBQ afterward, but that can be a good thing. The gumbo and chili are super too!
I read a review where someone thought the sandwiches were bland...wow that can't be further from the case. Give it a try. Don't miss there parking lot BBQ on April 30th either. We are definitely going back for that."}
{"text":"Great food, great flavor! I am new to the Phoenix area and tried a few different bbq places and none were as good as this place. My new spot! And the Mac and cheese is amazing"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite place for BBQ. Their pulled pork is ridiculously tasty and the BBQ beans and coleslaw are top notch. I tried their food from their Free BBQ day where all the money raised for the day goes to benefit Phoenix Children's Hospital...class act all around!"}
{"text":"Dankys: we'll be back just because of the name. 

I ate here with a few friends at 7pm on a Friday. After searching on Yelp for a spot to eat BBQ this place seemed like a winner. 

Arriving we were meet with Dankys younger brother running the register and taking orders. Cool kid and is exactly who you'd expect to be steering the ship at Dankys. 

We ordered the family sized meal. Pulled pork, ribs, and brisket. All 3 were a grand slam. The trays of food arrived with minimal wait time. The staff working the kitchen were all singing and full of smiles. 

This isn't a polished estabiliahment so don't come here expecting to have a lemon towel to wipe your hands off. Picture a hockey bar that serves Miller Lite cans with the smell of BBQ in the air. That's Dankys. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Chicken legs and beans were fantastic.  Good local BBQ spot.  Far better than any of the chains I have been too."}
{"text":"Great food and great service at a reasonably priced BBQ joint.  We plan to return again & again.  

The only suggestion I would make is to change the lighting.  It is very dark in there and the recessed lighting is above the ceiling fans, so the entire place has somewhat of a strobe light effect that can sometimes cause problems in some people with special needs."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. This is a brand new place in town and I will continue to give them my business. Price point is great for a to-go meal or something sit-down."}
{"text":"Best Ribs in town.  Happy to see great Bar-B-Q in neighborhood.  Excellent baked beans side and service."}
{"text":"I just visited them not to long ago. The staff is really friendly and also gave me at 10% discount because of my job. Love them already! Anyways I got a pulled pork sandwich with bbq sauce on the side because I wasn't sure if I'd like it. But it was really good. Good customer service & BOMB Food what more could you ask for. Will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I give it 3.5 stars. Good amount of food for the price, really friendly staff, but we thought the food was just okay. The southern potato salad was my favorite. I liked the chicken okay, but mine was a over done. My wife got the ribs, which I liked but she didn't."}
{"text":"So I was going to take a picture of this delicious food, but I ate it too fast. The Danky Dank was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had, and the sausages were also good."}
{"text":"Incredible brisket. 

Ribs were fall off the bone. 

Great accompaniment with the corn muffin beans and slaw. 

Highly recommended and will return."}
{"text":"I've lived for 30 years in KC, Missouri so I've had my fair share of good BBQ. So for me I had to try this place bc I've heard so much. I had the three meat tray, why not it's only a dollar more from the two meat tray?? No brainer. I had the pulled pork, brisket, and chicken breast-carry out. I could really taste the smokiness and flavor in the chicken. The beef and pork were full of flavor. The BBQ sauce was good but a little too watery for me. I'm a fan of Sweet Baby Ray's personally. I wished the meats had more juiciness in them but it was take out and I wasn't able to eat it right when it came to my jobsite. Plus the BBQ sauce was held on the side. Definitely will be trying more to get a feel of their BBQ. Next are the ribs."}
{"text":"So glad Danky's opened. Real smoked BBQ!!  Pulled pork, chicken, brisket, hot links!  Awesome sides as well.  You gotta try the javalina sauce and the pit beans!!!  If you like BBQ, get to Danky's NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Dankys for the first time today. Pulled pork sandwich with their traditional BBQ sauce was awesome. Without a doubt one of the top 3 I've ever had. The owner and his staff were great. Will definitely be back for their ribs!!!"}
{"text":"Had the ribs for dinner tonight and they were awesome! The meat fell right off the bones. My husband had the pulled pork and brisket dinner, they were amazing too! The service was fast and the staff/owner were super friendly and helpful. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"When we called for a takeout order my husband asked if the sides were shareable ( we have 5 people in our family. ) The employee who answered the phone said they were. The sides we got were maybe for one person. So be specific when you ask.
Their food was very good!  No complaints from my kids at all. We will definitely be back, and just ask for more food."}
{"text":"I love ribs, and Danky's did not disappoint. Their food is excellent and their prices are great as well."}
{"text":"Great reviews but just ok.  So I had a half rack, baked beans, Mac n cheese, corn bread and a soda.  Cost $23 which seems a tad pricey.  Well the 1/2 rack was huge more like a3/4 rack.  Fall off the bone with a tangy sauce.  But I didn't love them.  Baked beans were not good.  Mac n cheese was average at best and the corn bread unremarkable.  I really wanted to love it but just could not.  Probably 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The beans take 17 hours to make but only 5 minutes to devour! Great BBQ, the sauces range from sweet to hot. Loved the brisket"}
{"text":"We ordered the #4 for takeout. It has a little bit of everything. The service was friendly and the food was amazing. If you like a little spice, the javelina sauce can't be missed"}
{"text":"Yesterday was out second visit and we got there around 4pm i think. Me and my boyfriend have enjoyed coming here. We're always ordering ridiculously latge meals and we never finish them. Staff is always friendly and smiling and always helping and willing to make your experience even more awesome. Food is always delicious and I can make several meals out of it. Love you guys! Gotta bring some of my friends here! The mac and cheese and root beer floats are my fave!
√í"}
{"text":"The food, the price, the sides, and even the service are amazing!! The meat tastes perfect, their sauce is homemade and has a nice spice to it, and you can tell they care about their craft and customers. Wish I lived closer because I would surely be a regular! Great job Dankys!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was great although for next time I'll probably choose the plate with meat and 2 sides just because the bread wasn't fantastic. 
Cole slaw was great in the sandwich, side of Mac and cheese was a little bland so I'll have to try other sides and pick the best ones :)

Great service, fast and personable 

Also for the kiddos - try the nuggets, not in-house made but yummy regardless 

My husband and I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I love going To a  place where I feel welcomed and this place welcomed me with open arms fast friendly service food was fresh and hot. Not a long wait time I like the fact that the owners was working the French fries were fresh cut and homemade the Mac cheese was good could have been a little bit more cheese but it did the job the corn bread was on point it went well with the chicken breast"}
{"text":"It's a small little place in a strip mall by Walmart but the food was pretty tasty. They have some creative and interesting sauces like pickle relish. The meet was a little dry and I couldn't taste any smoke in it but the guy who was running the register was super friendly and made a great margarita!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not someone who loves to find BBQ restaurants because quite frankly, BBQ food is not something I crave often. However, I wanted to try a new quick restaurant around the area and Danky's was my pick with their 4.5 overall star rating. 

I decided to place a pick up order: The Big Hot Mess sandwich with fries for hubby and I ordered a Big Danky plate of chicken thighs and fried okra. Hubby seemed to enjoy his sandwich, but when I tried a few fries of his, I wasn't a fan. The fries just didn't taste good. How do you mess up fries? I don't know... My chicken thighs though were pretty good. I loved how crunchy they were in the outside and tender and juicy in the inside. Surprisingly, the portions are pretty generous as they gave 3 thighs and I only could eat 1. The cornbread that accompanied the plate was okay and the fried okra was fine too. 

Not sure if this is one of the best BBQ in town because again, I don't really eat BBQ food so I can't even compare to other similar restaurants in the valley. The cashier was nice and the prices are inexpensive. Our bill came to around $20. Overall, not a bad place to eat for BBQ."}
{"text":"We came by late Friday night and saw the place was deserted. We were hesitant to go in without a Friday night crowd, but we trusted the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. It turns out it was empty because Danky's is in high demand and they run of of items quickly. I guess everyone knows you have to come earlier to get what you want. But they still had pulled pork which is my go to for bbq! I ordered the Classic Pork sandwich, which is topped with coleslaw. It was delicious but wasn't quite warm enough. We also ordered their IPA which is brewed by Mesquite River Brewing, and was very tasty."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.   Loved it.   Pulled pork was great.   Traditional sauce was tangy and perfect.   Fries tasted home made and cole slaw had a unique and awesome taste.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"We just had Danky's for the first time and it was absolutely delicious!!! We had the chopped beef brisket sandwiches with the slaw on the side! The brisket just melts in your mouth!! Love that there was sliced green apple in the slaw, too! It was so fresh and crisp! We also had the side of southern potato salad which was also amazing!! Our kids got the chopped chicken BBQ sandwich and side of mac and cheese- they finished everything and loved it!!!  Some of the best BBQ we have all had in some time!!! Thank goodness we live so close cause we will be back many times!!"}
{"text":"Anytime that we hear about a place for BBQ, we typically check it out. We moved here from KC and great Q runs deep! This is a quiet, unassuming space that has been around not quite 2 years and it located in north Phoenix. We checked out the Big Dank Plates (read combo platter). I always check out whatever poultry is on the menu (in this case, chicken thighs and smoked fired drums) to get a sense of their attention to detail (and if they overcooked it) and they crushed it!  Moist meat with wonderful flavor. They flash fry the protein and their hot links are very well done...not dried out and incredibly good with their sauces. They offer the brisket either fatty or lean...I mean...this is BBQ...fatty is definitely more flavorful!  We were brought a sampling of their sauces: hot BBQ (traditional with hot sauce and spices), a relish-based sweet BBQ, and their javelina sauce...tangy green with jalapenos). They were all very good and the hotter sauces were easy on the mouth...not lingering burn that would destroy the flavors. Cornbread was fluffy, mac and cheese and coleslaw (with diced apple) were very tasty.  This place is a go-back...!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"There aren't many places in the valley where you can get Faygo and Better Maid chips.  I'll be honest, it's the whole reason we came!  We were pleasantly surprised by the awesome service given by the owner, well, not really surprised.. it's that Midwest nice thing!  He took our special request for more Faygo (woot! woot!).  Then also made a promise to show all Detroit Tigers games and, come football season, Lions games, as well.  

Although I take offense to this (since I thought I perfected my own recipe), my boyfriend said their beans were the best he's ever had. 

I really loved their traditional BBQ sauce, as there was just enough kick for me.  The pulled pork was my favorite, but the many people that came and went with their takeout orders raved about the chopped brisket and the ribs.  We'll have to give them a try next time! :-)"}
{"text":"FINALLY, great BBQ in north Phoenix.  Made from scratch sauces and sides the BBQ meat selection wasn't good enough so they made javelina sauce to take it over the top.  I asked for a selection and that is exactly what I got.  Good portions of brisket, pork, and Links with beans.  Oh my lord the beans are great.  Had to wash it down with a PBR so y'all know I likes my PBR with beef.  Then to cap it all off, \"Memaw's\" hot apple pie a la mode.  And son let me tell ya it was 1/4 of a pie.  Emma was real happy to do Memaw proud in recreating her family recipe while Mike was eager to get me all the Sauces they have.  The javelina was the best, his favorite too.  I'll be back to try those other sides."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you... Danky's is some GREAT BBQ! Next to Wal Mart in a boring strip mall, this place is all about flavor. Try the Schmikey sandwich, it rules! This place should probably be on Diners Drive-In's and Dives!"}
{"text":"Consistency  is key. While trying out dankys a third time i had my fiance bring some home. We ordered our usual. Pound of brisket  side of beans and mac and cheese at 29 bucks.  We got another persons order which doesn't  equate to 29 bucks.  We live 35 min away and to much of a hassle to correct. Food is still good."}
{"text":"New to town, was looking for some BBQ. So happy to have found this place. We tried the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. As well as the okra, beans, and cole slaw. All excellent. I don't write many reviews but felt I needed to leave one for this place."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ place. Small, simple, and delicious.  Had the pulled pork, lean brisket, pulled pork sandwich, coleslaw, Mac and cheese, and fried okra.  Everything was great!!  BBQ is clean, tasty, and not overpowered. Sauce comes on the side, so it's up to you on how wet you want it.  Coleslaw is light and crisp with pieces of apple.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Two words: The beans!  Sandwich is good quality, no fatty pieces. House sauces are rich, definitely worth the try. Extremely courteous staff. Clean facilities. Have your next lunch at Danky's."}
{"text":"Met Pat the owner last night. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Everything was great. MAKE SURE TO GET THE BEANS! The smoked chicken drumsticks that is THEN DEEP-FRIED IS AMAZING. We will defiantly be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends because they were rated #2 for Brisket by Phoenix Magazine. And after seeing the high ratings on Yelp we all had high hopes for this place.

We went in on a Saturday evening. I will admit we got there late (7:30 - they close at 8) so that may have affected our experience. Although they were very nice to us, even if it was almost closing. 

Collectively we ordered brisket, pulled pork, chicken thighs and mac and cheese. 
The brisket was pretty good. Not super fatty/juicy but it wasn't bad. Would I rank it at #2 in the valley? Can't say I would. 

The pulled pork was very dry overall. There were a few good bites in the mix but sauce was needed for sure. We gave them the benefit of the doubt being late in the day - maybe we got the bottom of the pulled pork barrel if you will.

The chicken was really good! Nice and juicy, crispy skin, good flavor. It was definitely the winner of the dinner. 

And for the side, the mac and cheese was a little bland - needed salt for sure. I would probably try a different side next time. 

Overall the staff was very nice and the food was okay (chicken was great). I'd be willing to give them another shot earlier in the day to see if that makes a difference.

PS - they have their smoker inside so be prepared to smell like smoke the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Had pulled pork sandwich and baked beans, both were very good. Quick and friendly service, clean but dated look in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Danky BBQ

3 of us ate at Danky's BBQ & had a variety of their offerings. Each of us ordered a three meat plate with differing sides so we had good exposure to their food. We're big BBQ fans so here's our two cents:

-I'm not sure what's going on with BBQ joints that don't have true sweet tea but Danky's follows their lead. Sweet tea is available but it's out of a fountain so it's not the true sweet tea die hard BBQ lovers expect. 

-The service was amazing. We really enjoyed the gentleman behind the counter. He was friendly, talkative and very helpful. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and highly recommended the chicken (and we found out why ).

-The chicken was by far the best part of the meal. The 2 of us that had the dark meat chicken were super impressed. Both leg and thigh were very flavorful. Danky's smokes then fries the chicken so it's has the right amount of smoky-ness to match that solid flavor. 

-2 of us ordered sausage & had both the spicy and regular sausage. This was something all of us agree we wouldn't order again. The regular sausage was a bit spicy itself and the spicy sausage had a swift kick. Both people were convinced the sausages were not made in house. One person even went so far as to say they thought it was brought out of a freezer and cooked before fully thawed due to the aftertaste. 

-The chicken breast was probably the least favorite of the offerings. It was dry (which you would expect from white meat) but not very flavorful. It was a bit bland and was best served as a way to eat something swimming in the BBQ sauce. 

-The pork was decent but definitely dry & cold. Not a lot of flavor to speak of but was a little better than the chicken breast. 

-All three of us got the fatty brisket. These had a good flavor but it was very light. The bark you usually find on these smoked meats was barely existent and is normally the place that holds the flavor. If there were more bark in the brisket we all guessed it would give more of the flavor we enjoyed but was unfortunately mild. 

-The Mac &. Cheese was, well... Mac & Cheese. It seemed a little like a velvetta style cheese with regular macaroni noodles. 

-The beans had a nice blend of bacon flavor & onions. These were a pleasant bright spot and you will enjoy them if you're like your beans sweet. 

-The original BBQ sauce is sweet with a large amount of vinegar. I personally wasn't expecting that much sour so it caught me off guard. I'm not a personal fan of sauce with heavy vinegar but I got used to it the more I ate it. 

-We took the green chili sauce on the recommendation of the person behind the desk and we were glad we did. We liked this best on the brisket. It had great green chili flavor and not a lot of heat. 

-We weren't real big fans of the spicy sauce but 2 of us aren't really hot/spicy fans anyways. If you're a spicy person then give it a whirl. 

-We all ate the cornbread but agreed it wasn't anything we would order if it didn't automatically come with the combination plate. Don't expect much on this one. 

We would more than likely eat here again if in the area but wouldn't necessarily make a special trip. Overall every one of us independently gave the restaurant a 7 on a 1-10 scale."}
{"text":"Well Y'all, Im gonna put it like this. Yes the meat is tender and juicy! Cornbread moist and sweet. Mac&Cheese fresh and tasty. And that my friends is where the road stops! Breaded fried okra was frozen? Andouille sausage comes frozen from local Shamrock vendor...lol, not sure what they know about Creole sausage making??? I spent 30 of my 52yrs on the planet in the deep south, eating open pit BBQ at least once a week. From Memphis, through the Carolinas, to Georgia and down into Jacksonville Fl. Yes I know what SWEET, SMOOTH, SMOKEY BBQ taste like. From the wood used to the base of the sauce itself, (be it Vinegar base, mustard, or tomato base) Its the combination of these few ingredients combined with a whole lotta LOVE, that brings that wonderful taste to life. And while Danky's certainly is not lacking in the passion. Their quest for that smooth blend is definitely missing! Mesquite wood is all they use and while a hint of the hard wood is pleasant, most especially when combined w/hickory, cherry, pecan. By itself its very harsh & sharp! Their sauce very runny and not that smooth, too vinegary. That same sauce tainted the bake beans and combined with a lot of onions they were just wrong. Restaurant is small storefront, where folks ask to share your table as space is limited. And the meat comes out of a giant stainless steel box. No open pit here??? Music was GR8! My quest for good Southern BBQ continues."}
{"text":"We had Danky's last night. I was craving BBQ and found them by accident. We had the Curly Wolf and the Hot Southern Mess. YUM! We also had fries and fried okra. The fries were just OK but as far as fries are concerned I can take them or leave them. The fried okra was outstanding. We'll be going back often. I'm going to try everything on the menu, SOON!"}
{"text":"This is a very good BBQ restaurant. The beef brisket was great. The baked beans are the best in Phoenix area.  The prices are reasonable. I definitely will return again."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Ribs, sandwiches & the pork belly pit beans are the bomb! And Memaw's hot apple pie with vanilla ice cream, my oh my, is enough for 4."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I were also lured in by the Dank in the air on a trip to Petco. Haha Jeff is a big pulled pork guy and has tried several places around the valley and said Danky's is his favorite. There are pieces of the skin that are crispy and full of flavor that he absolutely loved. I enjoyed the chicken breast, fried okra (YUM), and macaroni and cheese. We tried both traditional and javelina sauce. We prefer the traditional but both are yummy. The staff is very nice, the music is great, and the food is delicious. Good job Danky's!! Oh and we love that you are local!!"}
{"text":"Brand new BBQ spot in my hood. Wanted to really like them as all employees were nice. However they have some big kinks they need to work out. 
Pros: the beans are legit, the two sauces are quite bomb as well. I would go back and buy the sauce if they sold it. 
Cons: I ordered a two meat platter. The chicken and brisket. Both were cold not luke warm, cold. The brisket was smaller chunks of brisket that he cut down to order. Problem is it was way overcooked. And the fat was white from the temp being so off. With BBQ fat is flavor but I couldn't eat cold white fat. The flavor was decent and has potential if they can get their temps right. The chicken was dry. Like got left out for a couple hours dry. I had to pour two containers of sauce on it to make it doable. No seasoning of any kind didn't get smoke or anything just dry bland chicken. The cornbread was dry as well. And it wasn't warmed up it was just pulled out of a Tupperware container and handed to me. So dry and cold bread had my coughing and sucking back iced tea. I would maybe give them another shot in a couple months for the beans and brisket but those were only two that I'd touch again. One of the people with me did say the cole slaw was creamy and good. After having Lil Miss BBQ and some other local spots this just doesn't come close, at all."}
{"text":"Service was really good, nice, attentive and friendly. The food was good, but not out of this world for me. I felt like the membrane was still on the back of my ribs. Pork sandwich wad good. Coleslaw a little different with apple in it, but good. 
Give them a try, they may your next favorite BBQ place."}
{"text":"I used to have to travel quite a ways to get my favorite barbecue sandwich (Pork in a Fork).  Now it's practically next door!  The quality and taste of the meat at Danky's is top notch; the sauce also is tangy and divine.  If you are an avid sauce person, look no further than this place!

Now, if this was about the sandwiches, alone, I would give this place 5 stars in a Phoenix minute!  However, my favorite barbecue staple is Mac n' Cheese and Danky's is practically flavorless.  They should enhance the recipe so that it really kicks when you eat it.  Otherwise, this place is great, the service rocks, and I definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Execution of good barbeque is understandably tough - especially in a neighborhood like this. I mean, there are so many similarly styled barbeque places within a reasonable driving distance of this particular joint, I can't help but wonder: What's the point?

So, going into Danky's, I expected great things based on the reviews. But realistically, and I mean this in the most non-malicious way possible, it really just doesn't stand out to me as anything spectacular.

My girlfriend and I split a couple of pulled pork sandwiches in the late afternoon. They use your standard supermarket-bought buns. The meat was very fatty and didn't really pack much flavor depth, which could be attributed to us coming in an hour before closing, maybe? I don't know. I wouldn't call it bad, so much as I would just say that it was forgettable. 

Sides for us included cornbread, which tasted exactly like the Jiffy-styled cornbread that can be obtained from Wal-Mart. The mac and cheese was kind of bland, although my girlfriend said the fries were excellent, so there are some positives to be found if you're willing to experiment. It just seemed that a lot of their stuff are things that I could have easily duplicated myself by simply going to the grocery store. That's not a good sign.

Perhaps their acclaim lies within their other meats? I'm not sure. On the positive, the staff were very friendly and chatty, so I'll give them credit for having some good customer service.

Bottom line: Based on all of the options we have available in Phoenix, they'll never be my top choice. Nevertheless, I'd still recommend at least giving them a try."}
{"text":"The guy with the glasses up at the front is so nice! He made sure multiple times that we were happy with our food. The food was also really good!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  My girls loved the ribs and the cole slaw was delicious.  I asked for the BBQ sauce on the side for my pulled pork.  I'm not a BBQ sauce fan, but this stuff is fantastic! Bonus points for offering Faygo and Better Made Potato Chips.  It was a nice little reminder of home!"}
{"text":"Loved it!! First time trying it and it was great food and great staff! Would definitely recommend and planning on coming back :)"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch. A bit more expensive than I anticipated from the location and restaurant style. The meat is great, and that's what counts. I'm not a huge fan of brisket, but theirs was very good. The beans are supposed to be award winning, and while they were good, I didn't think they were fantastic. The people are friendly and the service was good."}
{"text":"Food--all of it is fab. Tasty and high quality. Best potato salad ever. Brisket is killer. So are hot links. Customer service is fast and friendly. Owners are always there. Everybody hustles to ensure customers are well taken care of."}
{"text":"Delicious brisket! Will definitely add to my list of must returns...Friendly staff..If you like barbecue,  this is the place...."}
{"text":"Honestly, we wanted to love this place and like the other lower reviews we agree it was subpar BBQ. Based on the rave reviews I guess our expectations were too high. My husband had the BBQ ribs ($14 for a 1/4 slab) as well as the Schmikey sandwich ($6 served with a pickle spear). On the positive note he really liked the brisket sandwich, but said the ribs and sauce they used were just OK. I ordered the basic pork sandwich, we also got a side of slaw, fries and mac and cheese. The pork sandwich was OK, but really saucey and all the sides were extremely bland as many of the other reviews said. I also had an Orange Fanta in a glass bottle that was flat. I can tell they are trying hard and I wish them luck, but we won't be back. I've had much better BBQ for the price and for the people saying this is the best BBQ they have ever had I feel bad for them! On a final note we were there for probably 40 minutes and when we got home my hair smelled like a camp fire. I just can't, semi scared to post this review as I've seen the owner leaving some not so nice comments on other people's negative reviews, but here goes nothing."}
{"text":"I was expecting better from this place, but the meat were way too sweet for my taste. all I can taste is sweetness from sugar like in one of the ingredient."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place after a long day of jury duty, and I was starving! I loved it! It was so good and such a relaxed atmosphere. Crystal was very nice and helpful with the questions I had about the menu. I had the pulled pork sandwich with the relish, but I also dipped it in their traditional BBQ sauce, which was awesome! Fried okra and Cole slaw so good also! I live in the West Valley, but will definitely make a trip out here again!"}
{"text":"We shared a 3 meat platter.  The chicken and hot links were amazing.  The brisket wasn't as tender as I thought it would be.  When we were ordering they did ask if we like the brisket lean or fatty.  We told them lean, so maybe we just chose the wrong cut.  The mac & cheese was delicious.  We fought over it.  The sauce was really good, but spicy.  The corn muffin was a little dry, but it was good.  We would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great meat! Ribs were juicy and falling off the bone.  Sausage was flavorful.  Fried smoked chicken legs were like mini delicious turkey legs you get at the fair.  Fries were spot on.  Slaw was OK.  Mac and cheese was utterly anemic--didn't take a second bite. The batch of cornbread I got was dry and over cooked.  Will def go back for the meat!"}
{"text":"Randomly decided to stop and grab a pint of the baked beans after reading about them on Yelp and how good they are. They did not disappoint! Probably the best baked beans I have ever had! They are meaty and flavorful and paired well with the rack of ribs I had cooking at home in my oven. I can't wait to go back and give the brisket and pulled pork a try. If they taste anything like the baked beans did today, they will be dynamite!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Excellent BBQ, sides and service. Haven't had food this good in a long time anywhere."}
{"text":"With a name like Danky's how can you go wrong? You can smell the mesquite smoke emanating from this restaurant as you enter. The menu offers plates and sandwiches with various sides. The cashier today was Chad and he did an excellent job explaining their selections and offering samples of sauce so I could get the perfect accompaniment for my meal. 

I had the regular size pulled pork sandwich with javelina sauce and a side of fried okra. The pork had that lovely pink smoke ring tinge, and the meat had a nice combination of textures from the outer crispier portion and the softer inner sections of meat. I loved the javelina sauce. It is essentially a spicy green chile sauce. It had flavor, heat, and good consistency and went well with the sandwich. I also enjoyed the coleslaw, which was lightly dressed but still flavorful and the addition of apple to the mix was a surprising and tasty extra component. The sandwich was reasonably priced ($5.99) and was a large portion that definitely left me satisfied after wolfing it down! The only slight negative was that the bun got progressively soggier as I ate more of the sandwich so that at the end it was a pile o' mush when I took my last few bites.

The fried okra ($1.99) had a light crisp batter with tender vegetable. It was a great side to go with the sandwich.

Service from both the staff members here was very friendly and cheerful. You can tell they are passionate and dedicated to the product they sell here.

Overall 4.5/5. If I'm in the area again you bet I'll be gettin' some danky (Bbq of course..)!"}
{"text":"AMAZING BBQ!!!  The chopped beef brisket was the best I've ever had!!  Coleslaw was just like my homemade - with apples!!  So yummy!!  And they had my favorite beer on tap - Papago Orange Blossom!!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We haven't lived in Scottsdale long and we feel lucky to have found this BBQ spot so soon. The portions are huge and the meat is lean and full of flavor. The \"Dank Sauce\" they put on the pulled pork put it over the top. The customer service was great as well, we look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"This place really knows how to do BBQ.  I ordered the Schmikey, brisket with cheese, and it was delicious. Sides of coke slaw and mac and cheese were good too. While I was waiting, I saw a slab of ribs come out and they looked excellent as well.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  I will definitely be back, Danky's just got a new regular. Well done!"}
{"text":"A Groupon brought us in recently for dinner with some friends.  Great find as this was a first experience for all 4 of us, none of us knew about Danky's - until now.  We sampled a variety of offerings - BBQ brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs, sausage, chicken thighs.  Brisket was very tasty but a bit fatty, ribs were good, pulled pork was moist and delicious.  Sides okay, nothing special for the fried okra, French fries or coleslaw.  Wish we'd tried the beans.  The corn muffins were very dry and crumbly. 

Danky's is tucked away in a shopping plaza near Petco, easy to miss.  The interior holds a few tables for dine-in but it appears they do a good business for take-out.  Atmosphere is simple and functional.  Order & pay at the counter, they deliver to your table.  Self-serve fountain drinks with a gianormous paper cup.  

I like that Danky's is a hometown independent.  They are working hard to deliver good food and hard working folks.  They give back to the community and have special events to raise money for selected charities.  AZ BBQ has always left me disappointed but Danky's has given me hope that I can find good BBQ here.  I will be back to try lunch.  Thanks Danky's - glad to have you in the 'hood."}
{"text":"First time trying here !! 
Overall a good experience ! We had done take out .. The rib meal with 2 extra meats (we did chicken and pulled pork)... The chicken was very tasty ! Pulled pork was pretty good ... Ribs ,not my favorite .. Super dry and kind of fatty . 

Also negative they don't have a regular bbq sauce ... The ones we had all had a little spice .. Not the thick smoky kind . 

However I will go back for sure ! Next time want to try the okra !!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent tonight. I got the brisket big sandwich with regular BBQ sauce and coleslaw on top. Sides were fries and Mac n cheese. My husband loved the fries and my daughter loved the Mac n cheese. My husband got the two meat plate with ribs, brisket, beans, fried okra, and cornbread. He loved it and was able to bring some home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG!!! How great that this place is about a mile from my house!!!! Awesome falling off the bone ribs. Amazing potato salad & beans!! Cumin & pork in the beans slaps you but is SO good! Potato salad is on the tangy side which I love...lots of dill pickle taste, hard boiled eggs too! Sauce on the ribs is peppery & sweet...delicious! Mac & cheese is not too cheesy with firm mac & also peppery. Would like a bit more flavor as someone else mentioned. Corn bread is okay...needs butter or honey. I've always enjoyed Pork on a fork but this place blows them away. Small beer selection available. SO glad I came! Will definitely be back again! Ended up sitting near the smoker in the restaurant, came home with the smoke smell on me. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Georgia so I'm pretty picky about my BBQ.    As a KCBS judge I can attest that the Q is excellent and would rival any of the East coast players. If Danky's were in the south the line would be out the door!! Not kidding. Great find in Scottsdale. Brisket, pulled pork and pie were dynamite!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a wonderful selection of BBQ. The service was great. We liked the Different sauce samples to   mix and match the variety of meat choices"}
{"text":"I appreciate your response Patrick but I don't like to be taken for some someone that doesn't know BBQ. 
I was really upset about the whole experience yesterday and I started really digging into reviews and found one on realAZbbq.com and it was almost verbatim to what we experienced. As an owner you can't always blame your staff. 

RealAZBBQ.com Review
Last Updated: August 1, 2016 When owner Patrick Frederick opened Danky's BBQ in North Phoenix in 2015 next to a PetsMart off of Tatum and Bell, it was easily dismissed as just another pop-up BBQ restaurant riding on the rising BBQ wagon.
Just this past month, Phoenix Magazine's 2016 BBQ and Summer Food Guide ranked Danky's as the third best BBQ spot overall in Phoenix, behind Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ in Cave Creek and Little Miss BBQ in Central Phoenix. Danky's also ranked second in brisket and \"second to none\" for their BBQ beans.
Their large menu hangs on the wall just above what looks like to be about a quarter cord of seasoned mesquite wood. The commercial Cadillac Cooker is due right and the rotisserie slowly makes its rounds, carrying foil-wrapped pork ribs, shoulders and briskets.
Ordering is a tough decision. A selection of 7 signature sandwiches appears tempting, as does the smoked fried chicken drums.
I opt for the 1/4 slab rib dinner with two meats - brisket and andouille sausage with fried okra and mac and cheese on the side. For $19, it's not a bad deal for three meats.
dankys-bbq
Danky's rib plate with brisket and sausage.
As I waited for my tray of meatasticness to be served, I observed some oddities around the restaurant. A deep fryer that had seen better (and cleaner) days, tomorrow's dry rubbed briskets being pushed on a small cart over to the smoker, only for the seasoning to be rubbed off as it came in contact along the short wall that divides the kitchen from the dining area.
Real Arizona BBQ doesn't critique customer service, decorum, flare, or whatever else you think is important. The Maricopa County Department of Public Health doesn't pay my mortgage and I'm not an inspector, so there's not much that bothers me in a restaurant unless it makes me ill afterward. Real Arizona BBQ focuses on what's important - the smoked meats.
Unfortunately, the highly touted Danky's BBQ came in well below par for Arizona BBQ and restaurant-quality food in general. Hence, why you cannot trust Yelp ratings and reviews provided by journalists who haven't yet developed a well-seasoned palate for BBQ.

I witnessed the andouille sausage being sliced and warmed on a gas-fueled stove in a cast iron pan. While great sausage is a rarity in most BBQ establishments, and house-made sausage even more so, this is the first time I've come across pan-fried, charred and crispy sausage.
dankys-sausage
The pork ribs looked promising, although they must have come off of an anorexic pig as the bones were approximately the same size as one's pinky finger. The pork easily separated from the bone, overly tender, as if they had been wrapped in foil for too long. They were indeed moist, the sauce added a slight kick to them but overpowered the pork flavor and any remnants of the rub.

The randomly sized dollops of brisket showed no signs of smoke or seasonings, which was odd as the briskets heading to the smoker were seasoned with a redish hue to them. Most of the bark was missing, also likely due to being held in foil for too long and a careless cutter destroying the hours put into the briskets to create such a bark. Soft and mushy in some pieces, tough and chewy and others, my taste buds were in a whirlwind of confusion.

The fried okra was about what you'd expect and the mac and cheese was runny and made me wishing I was back at Pork on a Fork (their mac is truly second to none).

It's possible my visit to Danky's BBQ took place on an off-day. Every pitmaster and BBQ restaurant has them and they can be excusable. However, when your smoker runs on gas and electricity and you have a reputation to earn, there's no resting on your laurels.

I left with a slight nod of my head and a \"thank you\" to the courteous Danky's staff - I had a Alka-Seltzer cocktail waiting for me at home.

August 1, 2016 UPDATE: The owner of Danky's, Pat, called me a few days after his review was posted to take full responsibility for my visit and apologized for it not meeting his, or my standards. It had appeared that I visited Danky's on the worst week imaginable, one where he was experiencing the perfect storm of staffing, meat supplier and smoker woes that turned the restaurant on its head for almost a week. He noted he was working on improving a few of his sides, introducing new menu items and making his own sausage in-house. He was genuinely concerned about my visit and stated he was dedicated to consistency with the increasing demand of his barbecue."}
{"text":"We ordered the family dinner #1.  Everything was delicious!  There was plenty of food for 5, and we had leftovers!  The service was great, and everyone was very friendly. I will definitely come back next time  I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Great find! Grabbed a quick sandwich and will come back! Had the Danky and the sauce was unique and tasty. Husband had the Hot Southern Mess, and he loved it.  Evidently they won best BBQ side in the city with their beans, and the my husband ate them I believe it."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch for the 1st time and had the 1/4 rib w/2 meat combo (sliced brisket and pulled pork).  The ribs were big, meaty and delicious. However I thought the brisket and pork were a bit flavorless and a touch dry. For my sides I had the fresh cut fries and mac&cheese, both were cooked up fresh and both were fantastic. Would come back for the ribs and sides for sure. The brisket and pork doesn't compare to Naked or Little Miss BBQ."}
{"text":"Although Danky's has some tasty product, for the most part it is a thoroughly average BBQ restaurant.

The best of Danky's:  Pulled pork was moist and lean, fried okra pretty good.
The worst of Danky's:  Chicken thigh was deep fried and had no smoky flavor, french fries were soggy.
The rest: Average brisket, average potato salad, average beans, dry cornbread, no ambiance, crowded seating and not much of it, a bit slow."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Had the dank dank and the beans.  Highly recommend this place! The Danky Dank is the bomb and the beans are the shit!!!"}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good food. Much better than I expected, given that it's just a small place in a Walmart strip center. Very nice people working there (even if they are Red Wings fans ;-)

The biggest surprise to me was the 2 alternative BBQ sauces. A green sauce, and a relish sauce. The relish sauce was super flavorful, and was easily my favorite. They're definitely not for everyone, though. My wife and daughters preferred the traditional sauces."}
{"text":"Very good. Loved the chicken and the BBQ sauce. My husband and I shared the 3 meat meal and had plenty  good price and food"}
{"text":"Super friendly and quick service. AWESOME BBQ! Try the pulled pork w slaw, simply amazing! Legit BBQ joint with good food and friendly service. Warning, you will have to wash all of your clothes when you get home because you will smell like smoky porky goodness but it's just a tiny price to pay for authentic bbq!"}
{"text":"Came in with a Groupon, so the price was right.  The place is small, cute, comfy and clean.  They seem to do a big take out business.  The menu is very limited.  If you aren't having a sandwich, the only choices are baby back ribs or a meat platter, and you can't even get brisket on the meat platter.  3 of the 5 or 6 options are chicken, so meat choices were rather limited.  Ribs are very overpriced for a place like this.  The full rack is $27.95.   Heck, I can have them at a nice place and Don and Charlie's for the same price with service and atmosphere.  The biggest disappointment was the coleslaw.  It is not the creamy kind, nor is it a vinegar base.  It is just completely dry.  I am sure they put something on it, but if they do, you don't see it, feel it or taste it.  The cornbread muffins are from a Jiffy mix and were totally dry and overcooked.  The pulled pork and chicken breast are decent, no complaints there.  The basic sauce is quite good.  It's not my style typically as I'm a sweet, thick BBQ sauce girl, but I have to say, this was very tasty.  It's more of a vinegar base, but with some sweetness and a bit of heat as well and not overly vinegary.  The french fries are homemade and excellent.  That was a pleasant surprise.  The beans were good.  The mac and cheese was average.  Overall, I would try it again but now I would order differently since I know what I like.  It's worth a shot and they are very nice.  Glad to have something in the area."}
{"text":"Relish based bbq sauce is brilliant. Fried okra on the menu is genius. I love everything about this place from the limited seating, to the open kitchen, to the menu I can't wait to explore. Did I mention the okra? Second place in the valley I've found with it. Heaven. 

When I got the sandwich I was a bit hesitant about the look of the relish sauce. I was wishing I had gone the more traditional sauce route. That is until I tried it. So good. Get the Danky's Dank. You won't be sorry. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not really a picky eater but, having had some great food from Maine to Kauai, I try to be real in my assessment cause after all.... does the food and experience  really warrant a trip back?

Face it - there are TONS of places to eat. Burger and pizza places, taco joints, Mexican hangouts, Chinese choices and yes, dives shoving out BBQ on every corner. So there are certainly options in our culinary searching.

I was hoping for a great BBQ place in my neighborhood - ANYWHERE. I miss the old Frog in CC but when you look at general BBQ places you don't find many or any 5 star destinations.

I went to Danky's as it's close and maybe, hopefully a great find for my pork passions. they certainly try to please and the owner was nice while fighting a cash register reset. 

I decided on a basic for me which is the pulled pork. I usually judge the quality by the meat alone without a sauce. Is it smokey? Does it have a tantalizing taste not dependent on a slathering of spicy sauce to cover up its lack of swine sentiment? Is it moist or dried out waiting for the ketchup or vinegar wetness to bring it back from the edge of dehydration?

Theirs was a decent OK but not a top of the list hit. the overall combo of meat, sauce and slaw was about a 70 on the meat-o-meter. I'd like to think I could find a 90+ place or a 98 again.

The beans? OK but not worth the price. When you've had great, smoked BBQ beans with the meat drippings and some really good burnt ends added in from a southern roadside joint... you know what bean heaven is like.

Don't get me wrong.... this is better than some of the chain places and will warrant a return visit to try some of their other offerings but... it'll be with the same dire desire of opulent oinker or sumptuous swine that'll drive my return hoping to be impressed with quality smoke, reasonable pricing value and that overall experience that pulls me back as soon as possible.

When that happens... my 3 stars will move to 4 and MAYBE to a 5 if it warrants."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate since it's so close to my house, but was seriously let down.  The meat (brisket and pork) had an ok flavor, nothing special, however the pork was dry and lackluster.  The brisket was ok.  I'll certainly be back to see how things shape up once they've been running for a little while, hopefully food quality improves.

I'd highly recommend they work on the Caveman Platter.  If they are trying to ride the \"Paleo\" trend, fried Okra doesn't qualify as Paleo and when you advertise meat with a side of \"greens\", fried okra really shouldn't be included as a \"green\".  Maybe collards or mustard greens?"}
{"text":"Had the wet brisket, perfect,lot's of bark, moist, tender and flavorful. The side of Mac and cheese was also very good. They do only offer 1 sauce, I would liken it to KC style sauce. It was good but not my favorite when it comes to sauces. A few more choices would be great. That said, I'll definately be back"}
{"text":"I open the door and the smell of burning wood and meats overwhelm my senses.  The pulled pork is superb.  The customer service is  excellent each time I have visited. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great new BBQ place we tried today. We had the ribs and brisket and would order both again. The javelina sauce is yummy. The baked beans are very tasty with a little spice to them. The owner, Patrick is making the food himself. The service was quick and friendly. The apple pie was homemade and Patrick mentioned it was his \"MeeMaw's\" recipe. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ with really nice people working at the counter. The brisket is melt in your mouth good, and the BBQ beans are very good. Fried okra highly recommended. The smoked chicken breast is very flavorful and on the lighter side"}
{"text":"So good, the owner and staff are amazing and super friendly! Stick with the dinner plate, I liked that more than my sandwich. Brisket, chicken and hot links were awesome. I haven't tried any other meat yet buy I'm sure I will. Also the pie must be good because I heard two people come in and ask for it but they were out.
UPDATE: Everything is still awesome! They've done some slight remodeling and added a dog friendly patio! I'll be back with my pupps!"}
{"text":"I enjoy being surprised by new places especially when I can get a deal from Groupon. This deal was 22 dollars worth of food.  The menu was huge right in the front of the restaurant but the hostess went over it with us and we ordered our meal. To my disappointment Dankys didn't quite deliver. The meat was all served on a try which is fine but I do expect my food to be hot.  The Mac and cheese was the only thing hot on the tray. The ribs were lukewarm but fall off the bone good. The chicken cold, the pulled pork, cold and dry and the Cole slaw was different.  Oh and the cornbread had been sitting awhile because it was dry and hard.  Great customer service though but will I be a repeat customer, at this point probably not."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and needed some take out for dinner.  Found this gem bbq spot, the brisket and pulled pork was on point!  The ribs were delicious too, wish the sides were slightly bigger but the pork belly beans were legit.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The barbeque ribs were juicy and fell off the bone.  The sides, coleslaw, okra, fries, we're ok but not great. The fries were homecut and a little soggy. The coleslaw was not fresh or house made; it was too sweet and chopped beyond the \"slaw\". Okra was frozen and also not fresh cut; it was stool crunchy.  They also served corn muffins which were dry; They definitely needed butter and or honey. I'd go back for the ribs."}
{"text":"I went in to get food to go. The place was busy, busy. The combo meal was good with choice of sides, but the sauce was too hot or peppery for me to enjoy it. I'm a sensitive about spicy foods so for the normal Yelp reviewer, it will probably be fine. 
It's probably best to eat in the restaurant to avoid steamed fries! I was hoping for better with the baked beans. They were spicy too."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ we had the Rib with 2 meats. Chicken breast and Brisket. The ribs cooked to perfection exploding with flavor , the chicken was fantastic and the brisket was so tender and not fatty with huge flavor. Great beer and fountain choices . The beans have a special BBQ tangy and yet sweet n hearty. The slaw was perfect not too mayoeee . It's a must taste situation. The negative is they need more space for more to enjoy so get there off peak if you can."}
{"text":"A friend brought some of their chicken and some sides to a recent party and it was a huge hit! The chicken was out of this world!  So when I was in the area today I stopped in and had lunch. While I was deciding, the gentlemen that was taking my order let me try their javelina sauce; it was spicy with a robust flavor. The customer service is great. Anyway I ordered the brisket and a side - you can split it into 2 small sides. I got the cole slaw and the potato salad, both were enjoyable. Their bbq sauce is pretty fantastic. This is my new favorite bbq place in Phoenix. Hands down. Just the most delicious lunch."}
{"text":"I had the three meat platter - hot link, chicken breast, brisket with the split side of beans and coleslaw and a side of the macaroni and cheese. The hot link appeared to be boiled and not what you would expect from a BBQ house. The chicken was moist and the brisket was not and the BBQ smoke flavor was mild, too mild for my taste. The macaroni and cheese was the worst. Warmed up noodles with a canned cheese sauce mixed in and tasted bland like something you would expect from the cheese machine at Circle K. 

The slaw was just ok and the beans were the best offering. For a $17 lunch I was expecting much more.  The staff is friendly but appears to be frazzled when more than three people are in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I question ANY review for any barbeque restaurant that proclaims it the best barbecue on Earth or even the best barbecue they've ever tasted.  All that tells me is the person writing the review has never gotten around much to experience a lot of barbecue places or that the review was written by the owner's mother.

Danky's isn't the best I've ever had, not even close to it, but it's a nice effort for a little mom and pop place located in a Walmart strip mall.

A good review should touch on a few basics like ambience, good service, value and most of all the quality of the food.  Let's check those out.

1. I shouldn't have put ambience first because I could give a flying hoot what a barbecue place looks like. I've been in some with cockroaches running around the brisket and some as small as my bathroom. There are a lot more important things when it comes to barbecue places than looks.

2. As far as service, Danky's is top shelf. Everyone is friendly and helpful with no trace of attitude at all. This place must get a lot of regulars because in the short time I was there on a weekday afternoon (past the lunch mob) it seems they greeted everyone who walked in by name and asked how the kids and the dogs were.  That's a good sign.

3. And value?  That's a tough one because I think all barbecue places should be like the little roadhouses I've been at in Texas or Oklahoma where you can eat like a pig for a few bucks. Danky's isn't cheap and that's a shame, lunch for two of us was as much as I'd normally pay for a nice sit-down dinner at a decent restaurant.  It's not so much that I thought the prices were high it's that I expected more food for the price, in other words I felt they were being a little stingy.

And finally, how's the food?  That's what I'm struggling with. I read about their heritage online and I expected \"more\". The best word to describe it that keeps on nagging at me is bland.  I've trained myself to stop drowning my meat with so-called barbecue sauce which means I've trained myself to learn what great smoked barbecue meats should taste like all by themselves without being hidden under an blanket of spicy sauces.  For several reasons I don't think the owners of Danky's agree with me.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it just could be so much better. The sides (which sound so good on the menu) were also okay but not great. All-in-all between two of use sharing everything on two platters we had brisket, pulled pork, Andouille sausage, hot links, cole slaw, mac & cheese, fried okra and potato salad and not one of them screamed GIVE ME MORE! The potato salad was especially a let-down, I swear it was Reesers from Safeway.

This is a place I'll go back to because it's really close and convenient for me but it's not a place I'll remember and tell everyone I know about and drool over when I remember it.  For food and value I would give it 3-stars but they earned more for being so nice and for making the effort. I wish them well and hope they keep working at it.

[EDIT] I know it sounds weird but I just clicked through every user photo on this page and what stands out is how \"different\" the food looks like in so many of them. One that stands out is how good the pics of the coleslaw and potato salad look from Donna M compared to what I was served. Wondering if they buy their stuff from whoever they can get it cheapest from that day? My credo for a BBQ place is if it's not homemade on the premises, DON'T SERVE IT!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! The chicken thighs and brisket  are the best. I don't get the ribs often but they are very good. The backed beans are wonderful."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint in North Phoenix.  Their \"Javalina\" BBQ sauce is terrific and unlike anything BBQ I've ever had.  It's kinda like a hatch green chile sauce... and it pairs perfectly with the brisket and the hot link.  Great place to get your BBQ fix."}
{"text":"This is a really good place with awesome selection of BBQ and sauces.  Got the Brisket and Pulled pork plate.  The slaw was done just right and the staff were very friendly. I would absolutely recommend coming here for some good BBQ.  5 stars"}
{"text":"Came in with my son for an early Father's Day treat. 

I had the combo of MOIST brisket and ribs - absolutely outstanding! There is no better BBQ around!
My son had the fried drumsticks and MOIST brisket - he loved it!

This has to be award winning BBQ - especially the ribs!

Can't wait to come back - maybe tomorrow??"}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with our food!! I am a big fan of BBQ, in fact I'm quite good at smoking up meat myself, so I'm kind of hard to please! The pulled pork was very tasty and moist and had a slight kick to it without BBQ sauce. The brisket was yummy too! I got the lean brisket and it was really good, not overly dry like some lean brisket. I'm dieting so I didn't want the \"wet\" stuff, but I did taste it and it was extremely good!! I would have ordered it if I was willing to eat the extra badness (good tasting stuff)!! The beans were super good! The cornbread was a bit dry, but good enough that I ate it up. I prefer a thicker BBQ sauce, but we'll be back because overall it was a very good experience!

The place was a bit bigger than I expected. There was more seating than I imagined based on pictures. I took my food to go because I thought seating might be a challenge (I didn't bring hubby and kid). The atmosphere was nice and the employees were super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better, which includes adding new things to the menu. Gumbo and chili, fried smoked chicken drumsticks, and Andouille sausages make great additions to the already good standbys. The brisket can be outstanding or mediocre depending on the piece of cow, but the chicken is always good and the ribs reliable. This is a good place to eat in or take out and don't be afraid to try those new items."}
{"text":"Great new bbq place friendly staff and amazing food!!!  The Danny classic is very good but the real winner is their bbq beans.  Good smokey flavor and hearty sauce."}
{"text":"My desire for BBQ was reignited recently, so I decided to find somewhere new and not too far away. Danky's popped up and off we went! We arrived right around opening at 11am. 

We were greeted by a nice woman who took our order at the front counter and rang us up. This is a place where you order at the counter and they bring it to you when it's ready. The vibe of the place is definitely hole-in-the-wall, it's not super fancy but it was clean and there were several tables inside and a few outside. 

The staff was really friendly and asked us if everything was okay and tasting good while we ate. It seemed like they genuinely wanted to know instead of some places where they just ask to ask.

Onto the food: 

We both ordered plates: 1.) Two meat plate with pulled pork, brisket, a split side of Mac n cheese and potato salad, and cornbread. 2.) One meat plate with chicken breast, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. Both plates were served with a side of bbq sauce, one bigger for the two meat plate. They have a soda machine and also some beer to chose from. 

The chicken was some of the best we've ever had from a BBQ place. The brisket was delicious and you get to pick whether you want fatty or lean cuts when you order. Mac and cheese and potato salad were both enjoyable. I would recommend splitting a side half/half if you want to try two different items because one side is a pretty nice portion. I almost ordered an additional side instead of splitting but I would have never finished it in that case. Cornbread was good, but I'm not a big cornbread person so I am indifferent to most!

Ok, everything prior was a solid 4 stars, but what really tipped me to 5 were two things: the pulled pork and the sauce. 

Holy moly, honestly, I'm pretty sure this was the best pulled pork I've ever tasted. It was perfectly tender and had great flavor. Then the sauce: honestly the best. It's not super thick so you can lightly cover everything but it's not too overwhelming. It's sweet and tangy all at once and overall really complemented the meat. I hate super thick bbq sauce at places like this because it's hard to get it all over everything and even when you do, it's overwhelming for certain bites. Not here!!!! Yay!!!!!

I will absolutely return and really enjoyed my meal. They also have T-shirt's/hats/glasses here for purchase if that's your thing. I'll be stopping in to try some different sides. 

Thanks Danky's!"}
{"text":"Really good brisket and pulled pork!  Had the platter and there was plenty of meat!  Only issue was the corn bread muffin which was dry.   I will return!!!"}
{"text":"Tried it twice before actually reviewing. I was excited to try this place but it's not very good. My main issue is that both times I've been the BBQ has been cold :/."}
{"text":"WOW!  What a great find.  Hidden in the strip at Bell Road and North Tatum Boulevard, these guys know what they are doing when it comes to BBQ and fixins' ~ Yes, \"fixins\"!!  Make sure to bring your appetite and enjoy the ambiance or try takeout... both are equally enjoyable and satisfying."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq brisket sandwich and ribs off the hook !!! Great customer service to top it off !! Will definite be back !!"}
{"text":"Literally so good. Everything about it. The brisket, the pulled pork, the javelina sauce, and the service. Experience was great and the food was just as amazing. So glad to have found this little gem."}
{"text":"Legitimately some of the best barbecue I've ever had. From the brisket to the pulled pork and the amazing sides, it's all good! 

Quaint little place and a little on the expensive side, but the great food and friendly service more than make up for it!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Gotta support the local business, and this place is just what my neighborhood needed! A Midwestern, 'ma & pa' place that serves great food, great customer service and quality meat, not to mention cold beer. If you love BBQ, this place will RUIN any other BBQ you'll ever have elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Wow the food is amazing and pricing is fair. The atmosphere is kind of fast food-ish but don't let that stop you. I had ribs, fries and coleslaw. They were all excellent. They also have a decent choice of draft beers. Great place."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!  After finding this place just over a month ago, we have been back 4 times.  Every piece of meat they serve is excellent.  Try the brisket!  You have to.  If you don't want to dine in a very small, casual restaurant in a plaza, get it to go.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating.  Oh, by the way, I know food.  And, this BBQ is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great ribs ... falling off the bone. The beans have chunks of brisket in it. Pulled pork is smokey and lean. I highly recommend this to scratch the bbq itch."}
{"text":"Ate here with the kids.  There were no leftovers.  Friendly Customer service and great food.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm excited to see that their is a new place in the neighborhood & hope they do well. The best thing about this place is their customer service I walked in to grab some dinner to go on a Thursday night. I had mentioned it was my first time so asked what she recommended?  She recommended the ribs so I went ahead and ordered the 1/2 slab combo it was good came with delicious side of beans and Mac n cheese as well as a side of fries all this for $20 and change not bad it was enough food for my husband and I and 8 month old son to eat could have ordered more sides but weren't to hungry in the first place :) my husband really loved the sauce it is spicy and sweet I'm more of a smokey sticky bbq sauce kind girl but still was good the meat had a great smoky flavor and was very tender and the meat fell off the bone. They also had a good selection of beer they have your standard general miller lite type of beer and then a small selection of San tan brewery peach ale , shock top, etc so a little of everything for someone:) we will defiantly be back again ."}
{"text":"First time here. Not impressed. Ordered the smoked chicken breast w/ cornbread and Mac n cheese as the sides. Chicken was dry, funky smell in the restaurant and someone was drilling and doing some sort of installation or construction project at 6pm.  Seems like that could have waiting until after hours. Maybe I just ordered the wrong menu item, but it didn't even taste good. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Fast friendly service. Ribs were amazing. 
Defiantly will be coming back. 
Lots of food on your plate, so servings are well worth it.
Restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Definitely will return! Great atmosphere, super friendly employees! 

We ordered hot links, pulled pork, the pork belly beans, okra and mac and cheese. Both plates came with cornbread too. I'm from Tennessee, so I know good BBQ. Everything was great! The beans were probably the best I've ever had! Loved them! My only complaint was about the mac and cheese. It was a little bland and not very cheesy. So we just doused it with some cajun seasoning at home. I'd also love to see some sort of potato on the menu other than fries, maybe mashed or a baked potato. 

Excited to return!"}
{"text":"Want good midwestern bbq?!? Not in the Midwest?!? Go to Danky's. 

For all of you southerners out there, you cannot compare it to the good ol' hole in the wall BBQ joints in the south, because it's a different \"style\" of BBQ. It's amazing! 

The ambiance is nice. The owner is often in there working and/or having a good time. We over heard the owner telling a few guests about how he got Danky's started. All of the employees are very personable and have amazing customer service to the T. 

Their pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches are great. BBQ sauce is good enough to ask for extra. Fries are delightful and their baked beans are... definitely worth the try! 

Sit outside. Sit inside. Enjoy a beer or enjoy a sweet tea. Whatever it is you enjoy, do it at Danky's! 

A southerners recommendation."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Schmikey Sandwich with Potato Salad and Pork Belly Beans. The beans are loaded with meat- almost a meal in itself!  Potato salad was decent and not my fave as they were heavily loaded with mustard- not my personal preference."}
{"text":"We gave it another try!!! The food was amazing! The ribs, pulled pork, and brisket were top notch! The barbecue sauce is a bit spicy but so good!!!So glad that we gave it another go because the second time around was a completely different experience from the first time we visited. This is such a convenient location for us and we definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for some good comfort food! This place was the best! Yummy brisket, Mac n cheese & fries! The price was right.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite BBQ place! Excellent food, warm and friendly staff. Hubs had the pulled pork plate with fried okra. I had the smoked chicken drum sticks and fries. Sauce is served on the side, which I like a lot as I am not a big sauce fan, but I totally like their sauce. The pork belly beans are marvelous. The music is great and for sports fans, TV's all around, but none of it drowns out your conversation. Great place, try it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Dankys.  I came right when they opened at 11am.  Very friendly service. when my food was ready for take out rather than just putting it out on the counter, he personally bright it to the table I was waiting at.  I think thats Very good customer service.  The food was delicious and done right,  it tastes the why BBQ should taste.  I could tell that they are passionate about cooking bbq.  I give them five stars and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This place is not Rudy's, nor the Big Apple. Thank god. The small hometown atmosphere is much appreciated. And the BBQ is very good. Can't really describe it. The ribs are amazing. Come try it out. Patrick is as nice as they come."}
{"text":"Danky's is our current go-to BBQ place for those nights when cooking at home just isn't happening.  It's not the best but it is the closest to us.  You can't go wrong with their oh so tender pork ribs smothered in their delicious BBQ sauce or their slow cooked brisket.  

It's their sides that are are a bit hit and miss, though.  The cornbread muffins have seen some improvement since they've opened their doors.  I can't say the same holds true for the potato salad and coleslaw.  Some improvement would be appreciated and duly touted."}
{"text":"Great food, great personal service and very relaxed atmosphere.  I can't say enough good things. So excited to watch this small business explode. Definitely try thus place!"}
{"text":"So fire! The hot southern mess is the best thing ever. The fries are awesome too. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! I've lived close to here for years and never thought to stop in and immediately regretted it. A tiny hole-in-the-wall, Danky's has amazing BBQ and beer on tap. It's just what you'd hope for from a little BBC place.

I had the rack of ribs, fries, and coleslaw. The slaw wasn't my favorite, but wasn't bad. Tried some of the potato salad on the table which was great. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"this place is the best. great prices for bbq and the food is definitely fresh. so delicious"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars simply because it was clean. The mac and cheese was definitely out of a box.  The coleslaw was bitter.  The brisket was serviceable, but the sauce horrendous.  I'm not gonna be coming back."}
{"text":"Good brisket, ok ribs (bit dry).  Nice service, pleasant people.  Good but better bbq can be found."}
{"text":"My husband and I have had the pleasure of eating your delicious ribs.  The side dishes are SO good and the to go experience was great.  Employees were very friendly and service top notch.   Your new employee, Joe, is very cordial and is very attentive to detail.  Keep up the good work.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. Lean brisket was so tender. Pulled pork was juicy and great flavor. I had the slaw an mac n cheese for sides, both great. Also had the ribs. Great, tender, slide off the bone. My only concern, for $24 for lunch with drink, these were the tiniest ribs I've ever had. Again great flavor and all but hardly any meat on the section i was served. Like i said for the price throw in another bone or two if youre going to serve the stubby end.

Great friendly staff, too. Thankfully they finally turned on the fans as it was about 90 in the restaurant. Hard to relax and enjoy great food when youre dripping with sweat. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was really good! My family and I all shared the 3 meat combo with 2 extra sides! BBQ SACE WAS AWESOME, loved the beans and corn bread. 
It was really good and a great deal! A plus is we also found out the owners were from Detroit! My husband is from there as well, Nothing like eating Detroit BBQ in Az."}
{"text":"After seeing all the reviews and being new in town figured we would give it a try. Arrived about 30 before closing and was getting a to go order. Ordered the brisket and coleslaw for my wife and I got the same with mac n cheese. After bringing it home we started to enjoy what smelled like a great meal, wrong.  The brisket which was supposed to be moist but was almost all fat and not the best barbecue I have had by a long shot (sliced it up to feed the dogs). The coleslaw tasted sour and the mac n cheese tasted like kraft box of mac & cheese. Needless say don't think we will be returning and our quest for a good barbecue place here in Phoenix that can rival the place we left back in Vancouver, WA."}
{"text":"So....we tried Danky's again. We went in for a brisket sandwich a couple weeks ago and it was very good. We got a mix of moist and lean. Good smoke flavor. The fries were good too, along with a Kiltlifter in a can! Tonight, we picked up a full rack of ribs and a half pound of brisket along with the yummy beans and some mac n cheese. I remembered to shoot a pic of the meat to show the difference between the first time and this one. My husband just asked me, as he shoveled more ribs into his mouth, \"Are you sure these are from the same place?!\" They are, and they are delicious. You can see the smoke ring in the meat and actually taste the smoky flavor. The meat is perfectly tender and moist and the fat is properly rendered on the ribs and brisket tonight. That javelina sauce is still the star of sauces we've tried. It's so different and so tasty. It's very rare for me to jump from two stars to five, but I did, because the changes were so noticeable for the better. The owner really listens to his customers and takes suggestions to heart. They are still new and they are really adjusting to meet higher standards. They really care about their food quality, their restaurant, and their customers and it shows. Glad I decided to try them again! Great BBQ!!! Look out Texas...and Memphis..."}
{"text":"Great bbq, sauce is delicious (tangy and spicy). Sandwiches are good, was perfect for family outing, including our 1 year old who loved the chicken flavor with the sauce."}
{"text":"I was craving BBQ and remembered seeing a new BBQ place opened close to my house. First of all, before even trying the food, I was blown away by the reasonable prices. BBQ is usually fairly expensive and I couldn't believe I could get a 2 meat platter for only $11!  I was even more blown away at the portion size for the price.  They did not skimp out. But most importantly, the meat was phenomenal! I got the pork and chicken. The chicken was super moist and both were full of flavor. If I had one complaint, it would be that I wish the Cole slaw was a little more creamy.  And it's such a minor thing, I feel bad for even mentioning it. One thing is for sure, I'll need to increase my gym time as I plan on frequenting this place often!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The portions were really big. The potato salad is to die for !!!!!! Great atmosphere and clean ."}
{"text":"Yum!! Cool little spot. Incredibly friendly staff with delicious BBQ. Great prices. This will be our new go to."}
{"text":"Place is legit. Right by my house. Pretty awesome to have such a strong bbq place there. The guy smokes all the meat - he has probably a $50,000 smoker in there. Thing looks like the front end of a mac truck. Great flavor, great sauce, nice owner and service people. Headed back 100%."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!  Everything we've had has been amazing!  Great staff, super friendly and helpful.  They have TV's with Center Ice & Sunday Ticket!!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OMG...this BBQ is bomb AF.  I had the pulled pork sandwich topped with green apple coleslaw with a side of potato salad, all sooooo good.  Pulled pork was cooked perfectly.  My friend had ribs and brisket. The brisket was amazing. The bones just fell out of the ribs, also cooked perfectly.  The house BBQ sauce was really good too.  Service and staff even let us stay late to finish our food.  Definitely will be back.  Ate all the food before I could take a pic lol"}
{"text":"This is crazy! Where is the best BBQ in the country....well I would have said:
\"For brisket, TX...pulled pork, Carolina...ribs, Memphis or Kentucky...chicken, Atlanta\"

Boy was I wrong!

I decided to stop by and sincerely, I planned being the one guy that disagreed with the reviews (I usually am). To my surprise, I FOUND THE MOST AMAZING BBQ I've ever had! 

Where to start...well meat first then sauce n sides.

Brisket - moist, solid smoke ring, sliced right, not greasy...and the flavor profile was amazing!

Pulled Pork - not as moist as Carolina PP, however, the most flavorful pulled pork I've ever had. The owner of this recipe has a righteous pallet!

Ribs - oh my what ?!? So good I couldn't sauce, I mean perfect bark, juicy, with a rub that is to die for.

Chicken - yes...yes...yes...doesn't seem possible, but crispy skin, moist meat drums with again an original flavor profile that you can't help but want more and more of.

Sauces

Hot BBQ - greatest BBQ sauce I've ever had, hands down, unique spicy sweet combo that will not remind you of any other sauce, but will be the one you never forget!

Reg BBQ - Fantastic sauce, I would prefer a tad bit thicker....but the flavors are spot on. If this was jarred, I'd by it because it's better than the sauce I make at home. 

Sides:

Mac n Cheese - really good, great balance of cheesy without being too gooey, pasta cooked right, seasoned well. Not mnc for the pretentious...this is good home cooking.

Fries - Spot on, cooked right, salted right, killer.

Service - Well, I didn't get her name...but the girl that took my order, I would hire in a heartbeat! Fun, on point, attentive, and just a pleasure to buy from!

All in all...Danky is DAAANKY BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant tucked in the shopping plaza with Walmart. Went in with low expectations and Groupon. Left very surprised and impressed by rhe food and service. 

We both ordered a 2 Meat Dank Plate at $12.49 which comes with one side. One Dank Plate had the Fatty Brisket along with the Sausage and the other had the Smoked Fried Drums and Pulled Pork which both came with a cupcake size cornbread. Our sides were the Pork Belly Pit Beans and the other were the French Fries. 

Would highly recommend the Smoked Fried Drums (Drumsticks) and the Fatty Brisket. The Smoked Fried Drums are excellent with a crisp skin that is smoked which was a good combination of taste and crisp skin, while they asked what kind of brisket we preferred,  lean or fatty and we chose the tender juicy fatty type which was an excellent decision. The Sausage was also good and would recommend as a 1A choice, the pulled pork was the LEAST favorite of the four entr√©es. I think the pulled pork would have been better with bread as a sandwich rather than by itself.

As for the sides, I really enjoyed the Pork Belly Pit Beans with a solid taste and flavor. The French Fries were a little on the soggy side where I prefer a little bit more on the crispy side.

The Dank Plates come out on a cooking sheet with a kind of lining paper and a fairly nice amount of each item you order.

The restaurant is small which has around 3 tables that can sit 8 people and 3 tables that can sit 4.

The staff were all friendly and helpful with helping you order and making sure you are taken care of.

Enjoyed the total experience and was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant and will be back again.

One reminder tip, if you can get a Groupon for Dankys,  go for it to save some $$"}
