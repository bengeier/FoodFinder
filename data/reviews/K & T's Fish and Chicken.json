{"text":"It's good place for having food to go.The fries are soooo good even when they are cold. Services are good and quick. Tasty cheeseburger but the fired chicken tastes bad. Try their cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"My son and I checked this place out on our search for great fried chicken in Pittsburgh.  Still searching.  The chicken only comes in wings or drumsticks, no other cuts that we could find.  It lacked salt and spice, though it was nicely fried.  The place is dirty.  Outside of fried food, you can buy cigarettes, cigars, bongs, rolls of paper towels and toilet paper.  Bizarre.  The French fries were the best part - they are truly special."}
{"text":"We ordered K&T's via GrubHub last night (11pm on a Sunday) for delivery, and the food was very, very good! We got the catfish nuggets, a few fish sandwiches, and a turkey sandwich, all were A+. The restaurant was nice enough to include any condiment imaginable (seafood sauce, tartar sauce, mayo, hot sauce, ketchup, etc.), and the fries were perfect - sort of semi-crunchy but tender, damn good fries. Would order again!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised. My chicken didn't have much flavor, but they furnished my package with multiple condiments including tartar sauce, a cup of hot sauce, seafood sauce, and BBQ sauce. My fried shrimp was delicious as was the cole slaw---creamy and full of flavor. The fries were crunchily amazing!!!! I even went out on a limb and decided to try a slice of cheesecake, which wasn't bad but I probably won't order it again. Overall, I was pleased and will order from here again!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Pitt for two years now, and it's my first time here. My parents are in town and they walked by this place and thought it looked .. interesting? they had a post it about gizzards and it had reminded them of a place back at home (Go Chicken Go, from Kansas City anyone?) The first impression walking in was all the tobacco products they're selling in the counters.. and toilet paper and paper towels??  Onto the food: It was actually pretty good! Our meal for 4 was ~$35. We got wings, gizzards, and the fish tagime(?). The wings and fries were crispy, you could get a cheese dip for the fries. And they give you some hot sauce and ketchup too. The fish was plain, so I'd probably not get it again.. It needed some salt or something... Worth a try! I definitely wasn't feeling it at first glance but the food wasn't bad :)."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo plate (with catfish, fried shrimp, fries, and coleslaw) and mac & cheese. Delivery was fast, like 20 minutes to Squirrel Hill, and everything arrived hot.  The shrimp and catfish arrived on top of a couple slices of white bread, which I guess was there to keep everything from getting soggy in transit. Well spiced, surprisingly good for delivery seafood. The huge serving of fries reminded me of the awesome cafeteria fries from my high school. The macaroni was something like what you'd find at a buffet - bland, soft, but it hit the spot.   Would have liked to see: cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, maybe buttered or garlic toast instead of cheap white bread  Warning: I'm relatively sure they use MSG. Tastes awesome, but some people are sensitive to it."}
{"text":"Ordered a combination plate (I chose 10 pieces of shrimp and cod) and a large order of fries for the two of us.  The best part of the meal was the cole slaw; it was creamy style and made from scratch.  The worst part was that it was in one of those clear, lidded containers some restaurants use for condiments for to-go orders.  So there were maybe 4 bites of slaw.  Fried food really does not travel well encased in styrofoam containers.  The heat from the food steams up inside the container and everything ends up soggy.  Unfortunately, this is what happened with most of my order; the fries suffered the most and we ended up throwing half of them away.  The shrimp and cod were edible but did not have any fried crispness/crunchiness I enjoy when eating fried food.  The seasoning on the fries was good, and the breading/seasoning on the shrimp and cod also good.  The shrimp were small, what you would get on a Chinese buffet, but not tiny like salad shrimp used for eggrolls.    The piece of cod was a perfect rectangle, leading me to suspect it was pre-packaged frozen and not fresh and about the size of a dollar bill (I'll let you determine if that's small or not).  I think if you try food from here, eat it at the restaurant, not get it to go or for delivery to avoid the soggy food I received."}
{"text":"I stopped by last night on my way back from an event, because I was still hungry.  Given that this place is a block from my apt., and that it was Ash Wed., I figured I'd stop by to pick up a fried fish sandwich.  Upon walking up to the counter, I was confused by a sign saying \"no credit\" on the register next to a bunch of credit card decals and what appeared to be a credit card machine, so I began to ask the guy at the counter if they accept credit cards.  The phone started ringing, and he picked it up and began taking an order while pointing to the credit card stickers, which I took to mean they accept credit cards.  I wasn't particularly keen on being ignored in favor of the phone, however.  After a couple minutes, another guy who'd been cooking (the owner, I suspect) came up and took my order.  I asked him if everything was a la carte, but he told me the fish sandwich ($7.49 w/ tax) comes with fries and coleslaw.  I also asked for his recommendation concerning the fish (they have whiting, tilapia, and catfish), and he recommended catfish, so I decided to go with that. He told me it'd be about 10-15 min., so I braved the cold to go back to my apt. to use the bathroom before heading back.  When I headed back, my order was ready, so after returning to my apt., I promptly dug in.  I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich, given that it fell apart after a few bites.  I suspect this may have been due to the lightness of the catfish (I'd never tried catfish before, so I wasn't aware of this) and the bun, which wasn't of the best quality, and was round, rather than long enough to encompass the fish.  The flavor was vastly improved by a liberal application of tartar sauce.  The coleslaw was even more disappointing, due to its overly sweet and creamy nature (I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw, but I prefer the vinegar-based version when I eat it).  However, the fries were surprisingly good, due to the batter on them, which gave them a pleasant crispness (which was perhaps maintained due to picking up the order promptly and living in close proximity).  They were even better with a sprinkle of cider vinegar (I'm not a ketchup girl--sacrilege in the city of Heinz, I know!).  Despite the service snafu and the lackluster fish sandwich, I'd be willing to try this place again for some of the Moroccan specialties, which looked interesting.  Next time, I'll call in my order, though, since that seems to be how this place does most of its business (I never order delivery, but this seems to be their main source of revenue).  In the meantime, I'll stick to Donatelli's or check out some local church fish fries to get my Lenten fried fish fix."}
{"text":"Have to re-review this place.  The food is consistent and nothing has changed on that.  So the drop of a star is because their service is starting to go downward.  I work just a few blocks up the road from the restaurant and for some reason each time we order, it takes longer to get here.  It is not puzzling to me and my friends.  I know it takes time to cook the food, but it should not take well over a hour for that to happen and for you to make it a few blocks up the street.  When my coworkers suggest that we order from here I always cringe knowing that there is a possibility that I may miss my lunch break because delivery is not always reliable.  It would actually be easier and possibly quicker if I were to walk down to get my food, and that would be with the walk back up the hill."}
{"text":"I ordered around 8:00 on a Sunday night and it took two hours to arrive. The delivery guy was very apologetic, which I appreciated, but the double the quoted time I had to wait made me bitter.  The food itself wasn't much better. I ordered a chicken sandwich, fries, and mac and cheese. The sandwich was fried well, but it had this strange white powder on it that made it tasteless. It almost tasted like they sprinkled the entire sandwich in MSG. The same thing with the fries: fried well but covered in this strange, tasteless powder that left a lingering taste in my mouth. The mac and cheese, although almost definitely Stouffer's brand from a box, was delicious. Honestly the best thing about this meal was the Diet Coke it came with, and that's pretty sad."}
{"text":"I eat chicken almost everyday.  I have been past this place many times.  I am surprised that this is my first time considering how much I love chicken!!!  Immediately when I first walked in, this awesome place reminded me of the stores / restaurants that you see in Times Square and midtown Manhattan.   They have a fairly large food to select from.  This place is very clean.  You can eat in or take it out.  They also deliver   The New York City feel is that they sell more than food.  They sell paper towels, chips,  candy, etc.  The food is made as you order it.  It does not sit under heat lights and is not microwaved.  The only employee is your cook, water, and cashier.  Very friendly   The food is excellent.  I am a very picky eater.  Definitely worth the value.  It took me years to stop in.  My next visit definitely will be within the next couple of weeks."}
{"text":"I checked this place out. I felt as though $9 for 4 chicken tenders and day old coleslaw from a dump on Centre was a lil ridiculous.  I found a place called Wings over Pittsburgh that has 1/2lb chicken wings (extensive choice of sauce), ranch and waffle fries for less that this. They deliver to Oakland and stay open until 1AM!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from here for the first time. I got a combo with chicken and cod, mac & cheese and hush puppies. The fish and chicken were both good. They were seasoned well and flavorful, but just a tad over cooked making them a tad chewy. Not so much as to be unpleasant, but a bit more than I'd like. The mac and cheese was very creamy and had that home style quality to it. My son definitely liked it. The best part of the meal overall was the hush puppies. They were very flavorful, not too dry and seasoned perfectly. Definitely the highlight.   The only other negative was since I had it delivered, the food temperature was not as hot as I'd have liked, though that is not uncommon getting delivery in this part of town around normal dining hours. It did arrive on time though and the driver was very pleasant. They also had snapple which is a big bonus for me."}
{"text":"K&T's is a great late night option for chicken tenders with french fries. Unfortunately, the shop closes at 12:00 AM on most days and is about a 10 minute walk from the center of Pitt's campus rendering a visit to K&T's on a very late weekend night unlikely.  For those with out stoves, K&T's also serves up fresh fried fish in their own batter which has a pleasant blend of spices. I recommend ordering a small portion of chicken or any of the available fish options. K&T's also permits you to order combos, so you can mix-and-match. I favor the chicken and tilapia. The serving also comes with cole slaw and two slices of bread. The two slices of bread remains a mystery to me while other seem to just \"get it.\"  K&T's is on the route of a Pitt Shuttle (the 10A), so I wouldn't be surprised if more students started to rave about K&T's if they stayed open later."}
{"text":"I have not visited the restaurant itself, but my wife and I ordered from them recently. I'm actually writing this review because we just ordered from them again and are waiting for our food to arrive.  Here's quick breakdown of our last order:  The catfish fillets are really awesome. Putting a chunk inside the included bread and slathering it with tarter sauce was as delicious (and junky) as you'd expect.  The fried shrimp are of reasonable size and taste fine, but they're nothing special. One way to judge fried shrimp is to ask yourself if you'd still enjoy them without any cocktail sauce, and in this case, it's hard to give a \"yes\".  The fries were good and reasonably crisp; maybe if they had been fresh (instead of delivered), they would have been great.  The fried mushrooms weren't so great. It's hard to pin down exactly what the issue was, but something about the flavor just wasn't doing it for me.  My wife ordered the chicken tagine. I only took one bite, but it was pretty delicious.  Overall, I really, really, really want to give them four stars for the delicious catfish-and-fries combination and for the interesting Moroccan menu items, but the lackluster shrimp and mushrooms is holding me back."}
{"text":"I came in late afternoon and ordered a small chicken tenders (4 pieces, comes with fries) and a side of cheese sticks (5 pieces, comes with fries). There were no other customers at this time. The order takes 10-15 minutes, which means that the food was cooked on the spot. I was slightly peeved that the cashier/chef was busy talking on the phone while taking my order. This, however, will not factor into my evaluation.  The chicken tenders were slabs of chicken breast seasoned in a fashion similar to cajun. They also had sprinkles of white powder on them, which I suspect is MSG. The tenders were anything but tender; they were dry and disappointing. I have had better chicken tenders from cafeterias. The cheese sticks also did not meet expectations. They didn't come with marinara sauce, and frankly, Arby's has much better cheese sticks.  The only redeeming quality of this establishment are it's fries. They are thick cut, and a superior version of Burger King's."}
