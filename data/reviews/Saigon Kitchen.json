{"text":"I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. Because to me, this place isn't blow your socks off delicious! Instead it's just good enough.   Look, when I'm craving pho I'm glad I have a place close by to order from, however it's just not as good as I'm used to back home. I think my problem is it doesn't taste as authentic as I'm used to. This place to me seems like it's trying to be asian fusion (like Pei Wei or PF Changs) when I just want pho nothing fancy just pho.  Though I did think the spring rolls were awesome!!!  But nonetheless it does fulfil my cravings without me having to drive 45 minutes, so I'm happy about that!"}
{"text":"Visited a couple of times over the last 2 years because it's close to home. The food is  okay  but on the expensive side. Service seems disorganized but I never had bad treatment."}
{"text":"We take the family here all the time. This restaurant is one of the best on this side of town. Usually crowded, fresh ingredients. Kids like the garlic noodles but I always get the filet mignon pho with lots of grandmas special peppers (you have to ask for them!)."}
{"text":"Our first trip but definitely not our last!  My husband & I picked this destination after watching the food review show Check Please on PBS. We were not disappointed! We started with an icy Suprise Sangria which was exactly what we needed after a long week. Then ordered the Filet mignon shaken beef served with a fresh green salad with a tasty vinaigrette dressing. Dessert was bananas foster with salted caramel ice cream which we split. Fabulous!  Dennis, the owner, was on site and we told him how comfortable and inviting his restaurant is. The hostesses, waiters, and staff were professional and very courteous. We were treated wonderfully from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out. We will be back to Saigon Kitchen again and will tell our friends to go as well."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so we went to dinner here.....overall, it was an average meal meaning it lacked flavor, very bland. Portions were on the small side but prices were fair!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and wonderful food.  I have had appetizers for my meal because the portions are such a great size.  I have enjoyed many things on their menu and thought they were excellent!  This is a place my mom and I frequent.  It's a 10 in my book!"}
{"text":"I had the combination pho which was ok. I liked the cleanness of the place although price is a little high."}
{"text":"The expansion looks great.  We enjoyed some new items that I hope to see on the menu- a combination crispy/spring roll, Siagon stir-fry and fabulous lamb chops.  Can't wait to have them again.  Plus, my stand-by items- firecracker shrimp or the shaken beef are terrific.  But if I stop n for lunch, it's the Dennis sandwich for me!"}
{"text":"I would have never gone to this place had it not been for yelp! This place is a hidden gem! I come here about once a week. I have ordered a wide variety of things here and I'm happy to report that I've yet to be disappointed.       Appetizer: their spring rolls are a must have. My friends love the shrimp one will I love their tofu ones. They sear the tofu making it firm and hefty so it's not some mushy mess like other places. Their peanut sauce is devine but a server gave us an awesome tip bc my friend has a peanut allergy, ask for the chili sauce or aoili sauce to dip them in. Best tip ever. Their Thai tea, coconut water, and jasmine green tea are so refreshing!       Pho. I've had the chicken, beef, shrimp, and veggie (I told you I'm a regular!) and they are all great. It's such a comforting soup and I crave it all the time. Their veggie one is particular amazing bc they cook their veggies to where they're a bit tender yet still have some crunch, the leeks in particular. They use fresh ingredients from Lee Lee's Market. Their Saigon noodles are delicious as well as their shaken beef and shrimp plate. I'm not typically a fan of rice vermicelli but my plate here was ok, not bad or good just ok. Their lemongrass chicken here made me a fan. I've been to other places and this place has the best.       Pricing and service. Ppl say it's a bit pricier than they would like but honestly it's not even that expensive. The pricing is similar to that of an Applebee's or other mid-level chain restaurant but the food is 100x better. I choose to support local businesses as much as possible anyways.             Service: speedy and friendly. I've never had an issue. Even when they're jam packed (snow bird season and lunch time) the servers always come by and check in on our table. Sometimes if I'm feeling anti-social or getting out from work late I just order it for pickup and it's usually ready within 10-15 mins (always the tofu spring rolls and veggie pho). I've gotten my parents, sis, and a few friends hooked on this place, even those that typically don't like Asian/Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"We are in town visiting family and last night's dinner was a meal at Saigon Kitchen. We were told that it might be crowded, as SK it a popular place serving very good food. I guess we got there right before the dinner rush as we we able to score a 'high seat' table right away. Timing was good because right after we sat down, every seat in the place filled up with hungry diners. The staff was friendly and in spite of the number of people seated, our orders were taken in a timely manner. Drinks and appetizers came out in good time too. For appetizers the four of us shared an order of Cahn Ga Chein Bo - Garlic Butter Wings and Goi Cuon - Spring Rolls. The wings were very good. Yes, I know, wings are tough to mess up but the meat was juicy and the skin was crispy - perfect combination. The spring rolls  were over stuffed with very fresh ingredients, soft roll with crunchy filling is the way to go. The peanut sauce was smooth and delicious. We also had a small bowl of the duck sauce, which had slivered carrots and onion, perfect dipping sauce. For my main dish I ordered the Com Dac Beit - Combination Rice Plate. This was Charbroiled Pork, Grilled Pork Chop & Charbroiled Shrimp over jasmine rice. Again, each protein was cooked just the way it should be and delicious as could be. This was served with scallion soup and a fresh salad. Having gone into Saigon Kitchen with no idea of what to expect, I left after enjoying wonderful meal which was both delicious and satisfying. When back in Surprise, AZ I will definitely be heading back to SK for another great meal."}
{"text":"This was not a great experience.   We waited at least 3-5 minutes before anyone came out of the kitchen to the counter to take our order.  We placed our order and took a seat.   We waited more than 10 minutes for our drinks.  The summer rolls (spring rolls Vietnamese style) were subpar.   They tasted fishy, we're not rolled tight and the peanut sauce was bland and did not have peanuts in it.  The beef pho was ok.  It was warm but pretty bland.   However it was the perfect size.  Not too much, not too little.  Overall not a good experience.  Food wasn't that great and the service was les than desired.  I doubt we will be going back."}
{"text":"I only ever get the shaken beef here and so does my wife because it is what I like, and it's that good.  It doesn't get any better than beef, rice, and sauteed onions for me and I could eat this every day, if my arteries would let me.  I have tried other dishes when I have eaten here with family and friends and the consensus is that the other fare is excellent as well!  My kids love the salmon and so did my mother.  I'm getting hungry for this place right now..."}
{"text":"First n last, price is so high for Vietnamese food, customers service is horrible, food taste so plain, I order pho n so disappointed. Staff act like I don't exist. Places is clean but I won't come back cuz food suck n staff are rude!!!"}
{"text":"1 star for great service Very pricey pho, servings are small, flavors are not there either.  Generally I can add in all the fixings and get an awesome bowl of noodles, but this time it was quite disappointing.  Not sure what they are doing, but we will not be trying to figure it out."}
{"text":"The banh mi and pho are really good, as some people say the raw meat is separate when you get takeout. Just heat your broth and assemble it as soon as you get home.  The different egg rolls are some of the best i have had, they are super fresh and always good."}
{"text":"Decent Pho nothing to write home about. Not a lot of depth in the broth. Still good though. However, their crispy egg rolls are on point."}
{"text":"We were a large party and the staff was amazing.  I will definitely visit the Saigon Kitchen again."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat. Great bar. Best vodka martinis in west valley."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food here was delicious (I had sweet potato fries, crispy egg rolls and wings with house sauce and Sriracha). Again, the food was delicious....until I found an insect on the lettuce that came with my crispy egg rolls. Of course this turned my stomach and I completely lost my appetite. I returned all of the food to the server and didn't make a big deal about it. That is until I was informed that because I ate 3 of the wings and some of the fries, I would still be charged for the meal, per the \"owner's policy.\"  I don't know of any person who could complete their meal after finding a bug in their food. The manager came to speak with me and informed that he took the charge off for the egg rolls but will still charge me for the fries and wings. Ummm, NO!!  I sent the food back not because I didn't like it, I didn't like the bug on my flipping plate!!!  The manager yet again informed me of the \"owner's policy\" and refused to side with me, the customer. After a few minutes of \"back and forth\" with me, he did however agree to take the charge for the fries off as well. Since I originally sent the wings back, and they still were going to charge me for them, I requested they make me another batch. Long story short, it's pretty sad that the \"owner\" would risk losing potential customers over this. He should be more concerned about keeping insects out of his foods. Needless to say, I will NEVER come back to this place again."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food however, had some major flaws. I got the combo Pho and there was nothing but fat intend of steak; also found a hair in mouth my after taking a scoop of soup. Upon finishing, my girlfriends chicken Pho also had a hair strand. Will not go back again for those reasons."}
{"text":"THE BEST VIETNAMESE I HAVE EVER HAD! You got to try this little family joint with, by god the best egg rolls ever. I usually get the  Shaken Beef, a tender, well seasoned, beef plate with onions, and rice. Though my experiences there I have gotten the Saigon Fried Rice, a wonderful, sausage, shrimp, and chicken meal is awesome! This place is HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat there frequently and have enjoyed every meal. I usually start with the spring rolls or skewers. Their Pho soups are delicious, well flavored and full of stock. The staff is very friendly and we are so glad that they extended their space."}
{"text":"Have read reviews. Including some of the negative  ones. I/we have been going there regularly ,ever since it opened.  We have never had any issues with ,bugs. Hairs etc.  In fact the owner seems to be  concerned about quality and actively solicits the customers input. We have eaten at many other Vietnam style resturants, S.K is in the top tier."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I have a place for pho close to me! The viet summer rolls were delicious too with fresh  herbs and clean shrimp! My pho had a nice broth, thin rare meat, and a plate of fresh toppings to put in. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The owner or only woman that was there was extremely friendly and loved my toddler which is a plus with me!  I only wish it was bigger like more of a restaurant rather a sit in fast food place. But please check it out, it needs to stay in business,  Also hubby had beef and broccoli which was very good as well, not your typical greasy Chinese."}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time we dined at Saigon Kitchen.  It will be the last time.  There were four of us; our meals came out one at a time, with several minutes between.  One of us ordered barbequed short ribs.  They were so tough, they were inedible.  When we told our server we didn't think the beef was short rib beef, he responded \"Is the meat tough?\"  One of us ordered lemongrass chicken; nowhere in the description did it say \"contains seeds,\" and yes, it did.  The place was busy and they couldn't care less than not one of the four of us will be back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean and modern, simplistic decor. Only giving four rather than five stars because the vegetarian pho was made with chicken broth. I was really looking forward to a big bowl of yummy pho, but last time I checked vegetarians don't eat chicken. The waiter, however, was super nice and I appreciate that he told me about the broth before I ordered and he helped me find something I could eat instead. (I had a rice vermicelli bowl w/o fish sauce instead -yum!) Great, small local beer selection and good happy hour prices. Didn't sit on the patio, but it looked nice especially for the cooler AZ days. Try to sit near the front of the restaurant if you don't want to be near the dish bussing station."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise. The staffs and the owner are super nice and accommodating. I love the pho and i get this all the time."}
{"text":"Pho is very good.  If you like Pho, try their cucumber salad and chicken & rice soup combo.  Excellent!  Service is very helpful if you need ideas."}
{"text":"Surf & Turf Shaken Beef is worth the stop in!!  The pho was flavorful and complex like it should be.  Even the broth served with the entree was great!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and fresh food! Pho an spring rolls (I had shrimp only) hit the spot - I an from the San Francisco Bay Area and have been looking got good Pho here in the valley and THIS IS IT!!!! Thank you SK for opening out here in the west. You saved me :) So excited to have many more dishes.  *Note: they have an awesome bar menu too."}
{"text":"This place amazed us.  While its not exactly my style of food, the wife and I have been looking to try different things. After reading the reviews here, we were sold and had high expectations.  Saigon Kitchen did not disappoint.  Actually we were blown away.  Everything we ordered, appetizers, beer &and dinner entrees had AMAZING flavor and quality.  I told my wife that the charbroiled shrimp was the best shrimp I've ever tasted....ever. The service was awesome and the atmosphere was enjoyable and fun.  I'm happy we found this place"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves a full five stars because of the service they provide and the fresh food that they make. As a business owner I can tell what place has the most authentic Vietnamese food and Saigon Kitchen makes it authentic ladies and gentlemen!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here is outstanding. My fallback/addiction is the shaken beef. It is so delicious. I traveled for work to Phoenix for three weeks and had shaken beef about 10 times. The customer service is very reliable and wait times for food are fairly short depending on the number of customers. Spring rolls and egg rolls are very good. My Saigon Kitchen sidekick loved the Vietnamese ribs. If you like Thai food, or a lighter version of chinese food, then dont be afraid to give this place a shot. I will eat here EVERY TIME i come to Phoenix, no question."}
{"text":"Good until about 12 hours later when you spend the next day blowing up from both ends from food poisoning.  PT noodles in Goodyear is much much better...."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, nice environment. I had the vegetarian Pho and loved it, my father really likes the place too, I recommend it to anyone, you wont be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Love coming here. The staff is super friendly. Great food, my favorite is the garlic noddles. Love how wheaten your dining in or taking out you can hop up to the sat to get a beer or drink while waiting for your food. Keep up the great work. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. We showed up at 11:30am & the place was empty. By the time we left nearly every seat was filled.  We had the Chicken Sandwich and the Rice Plate with Pork. The sandwich was so big that I took half home & the Rice Plate was so big that my friend who'd ordered it, a husky guy, couldn't finish his either. Both dishes had beautiful presentation. I also had the Vietnamese Iced Coffee and it was yummy. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the banh mi sandwiches.  I was really hoping that they would be delicious as this is the only place in the area that serves them but I would say they were just average at best.  I tried the pork and grilled chicken banh mi's (i preferred the chicken).  The veggies did not even taste pickled which I feel is the signature part of the sandwich.  They were also missing fresh jalapenos!"}
{"text":"By far, my favorite local spot to eat. Great tasting food, casual and friendly environment. Foods are freshly prepared, great presentation and tasted ummm believably good! Perhaps, most surprising are the prices--quality and quantity of food---far exceeds cost. I'm a hungry man and I can assure you--you will get your monies worth!  My favorite dish thus far is the Shaken Beef, followed by salmon and Cornish hen.   Great location if you live in the area, plenty of parking, personal staff---Owner pride.  If memory serves me correctly, most meals cost are between 8-12 dollars per person."}
{"text":"This was not my type, it was lacking the flavors I'm use to with Vietnamese noodles.   Its nice inside, plating is nice, servers are nice...come for that, but for really good pho, I have better options."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened in Surprise! My mom and I went to Saigon Kitchen for lunch and this place is very good! The prices are great and the waiter is very friendly. We had the pork spring rolls which were super light and fresh. My mom had the chicken curry and I had the short ribs. Both were excellent. They give you scallion broth, rice, and salad to go with the entree. The portions were just right. This place is great and I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The food and the service were both great. Thank you  The happy hour was fun. The wings were amazing"}
{"text":"I go here to enjoy the Combination Pho'. I come visit at least once a week. Now that they have expanded, I am hoping that the quality stays the same."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to the area, and we read this place had good reviews, so we decided to try it. We absolutely loved it , we received great service, a product made fresh to order with great  presentation and quality. Taste was perfect on all the dishes we ordered. Reasonable pricing, friendly people and great service. Also, we chatted with others there and learned they have great repeat customer base, we definitely will be revisiting."}
{"text":"Love it!  I ordered something with salmon and onions and it was delicious!  Also the spring rolls were excellent.   The water that comes with your meal tasted like tap water though.  I was going to ask about that but the owner/manager seemed really busy.  I wonder why they didn't give customers water to drink from the filtered water at the soda fountain machine and this would be the reason for the four star review."}
{"text":"Been here twice and tried the rice plates.  Food is delicious and meat was marinated with really good flavor.  Everything on the plate was tasty, good portions, good prices, very good service.  The restaurant is decorated nicely.  Enjoyed my meal and would come again."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've tried Vietnamese food so we picked Saigon Kitchen, and we weren't disappointed.  I wasn't sure what to order so I asked our server (Evelyn) and she suggested the Shaken Beef.  My wife doesn't care for rice so she ordered the Pork Stir Fry. Both dishes were terrific. All-in-all I couldn't have asked for more. The atmosphere is great, the service  and server were excellent, and I already mentioned the food. Advice: Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch a few weeks back.  My girlfriend and I ordered some apps for lunch to see how this place stacked up to other Vietnamese style places.  All in all not bad at all.  My only issue was the gristly meat they used.  Im a texture guy and I gotta say gristle makes me cringe.  Maybe a anomaly bad cut."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had at this restaurant. I can deal with higher than average prices; but when I'm treated rudely by the staff I will never come back! Check out my reviews, I rarely if ever give a bad review. Oh, and the owner? No customer skills whatsoever."}
{"text":"Sadly, this restaurant has closed. On the bright side however, a donut shop has opened in its place!"}
{"text":"The Shaken Beef was out of this world !  Can't wait to go back again and again ! Trendy, quaint atmosphere. So happy to have something other than a chain restaurant here in Surprise !"}
{"text":"Visited here in December 2016 per choice of family member. We got a plate of summer rolls (not fried) for the table of five people. We were hungry and were wolfing them down. Initially, I couldn't place why they didn't taste right...then I realized it --no mint. I said something to everyone at the table as we were finishing. We agreed--mint was missing and that is why they tasted bland. --We told the manager, and he looked at us like we were nuts as the summer rolls were gone. He also said he checked with the kitchen and they said they had put mint in there. (Um...no....none of us tasted it. He said maybe it was so small an amount we missed it. I think the kitchen was blowing smoke at him. I also think if it was so small an amount that all five of us missed it, there wasn't enough in there.) He said next time, to tell him right away if something was missing. My sister told him it wasn't her/our job to oversee his kitchen. (Who wants to deal with sending food back? I just want it right --the first time.)  My pho with filet mignon was meh. Tough steak. Minimal bean sprouts, basil, etc., served with it.   Three folks that ordered the Vietnamese sandwich really liked it.   My sister was underwhelmed by the clay pot dish (I liked my pho better than that).  Vietnamese food is about herbs, spices, and fresh, delightful tastes... Saigon Kitchen just doesn't seem to get the details right for me.  Overall, per prior experience with frozen vegetables (cubed carrots and peas), and meh food, I just can't recommend this place. Makes me sad as it is near my house. I feel like they ought to get the food preparation right. How hard is it?"}
{"text":"Quickly seated at 7:30 on a Thursday night.  Interior is mellow and modern, table was clean. Smelled amazing. Menu was very enticing -- we found it hard to choose. Server gave recommendations, which we took, and we enjoyed our meals immensely: firecracker shrimp and salmon on carmelized onions.  Side salads were fresh and the vinaigrette fantastic.  The broth served with my husband's salmon had a floral essence -- lemongrass? Lavender?  Amazing flavor for a broth. Young wait staff was friendly but a bit eager to remove plates we weren't done with, get us our check before we were ready.  Why the rush?  Plenty of tables were open when we were eating at 8 and I hate to feel rushed."}
{"text":"I love this place already and it's only my first time here!! Food is authentic and delicious and a good portion. The bubble tea is wonderful on a hot day. The owner is a sweetheart, like a mom away from home. I definitely want to come back for bubble tea every week!!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Fancy dishes and great service."}
{"text":"I wish I could recommend eating here, as the food was above average.  Unfortunately, the service was sub-par.  We arrived at around 6pm and the place was pretty busy.  We were told it would be about 30-45 minutes for a table, we were ok with waiting for that period of time. After about 25 minutes or so we advised the hostess we would also be willing to sit outside as we saw a few empty tables on the patio, after doing so, the hostess proceeded to sit a 6 top table on the patio that showed up without a reservation and placed their name on the list about 20 minutes after us. Finally being seated around 6:50  we proceeded to look over the menu and ordered about 15 minutes later. After ordering our food we did not see or hear from any wait staff for about 30 minutes, about 3-4 other tables had been sat after us, and the restaurant had mostly cleared out. Finally at 8pm we received our salad and scallion soup, along with the tables that had arrived about 10 minutes earlier.  I asked our server how long it would be for our entrees and the response was that it would be out in a couple minutes.  I received my entree, but my partner had to wait about 10 minutes longer to receiver hers. Other tables that had arrived 15 minutes prior to that were also receiving their food at that time.   At this point I asked the server if I could please speak to the manager. The manager arrived about 5 minutes later.  I spoke with him about our experience in the restaurant and was merely given excuses.    He apologized that the hostess was new and was in training (not sure why she was working alone then).    He apologized for the wait time for our food and said that it was because the kitchen was backed up. From the point we had ordered, we only saw food delivered to maybe 4 tables. With this in mind, it took an HOUR to cook a piece of salmon, 5 shrimp and about 4 ounces of steak.  When I asked why I had received my food but my dates food arrived 10 minutes later, he said that they do not have heat lamps in the back and they bring out food as it is ready.  So my food got cold,as I waited for my dates food to be brought out.    At this point the manager offered us a free desert, which we advised that we were not interested in, and nothing else. Had I felt that my business was wanted and appreciated, I would have given Saigon Kitchen another shot, but with the poor customer service I will not recommend Saigon Kitchen to anyone."}
{"text":"Told our (helpful and friendly) waiter today that we have never been disappointed in many visits to Saigon Kitchen.  The staff is very engaged and wants you to find a meal that you will enjoy.  Great balance of traditional Vietnamese dishes and also some creative new ideas from other Asian countries.  I ate a massive bowl of pho and wished that there was a second helping on its way when I was done!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food & service.  Had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls (Delicious), Avocado Egg Rolls, & Papaya Salad (Absolute Best).  Highly recommend all 3 dishes."}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago and forgot to review. So here is a review of what I remember. The server was fantastic and energetic. The highly recommended garlic noodles were dry and sort of gross. The rest of the meal was typical good asian food.   The only reason we havent been back is because it tastes just like normal pei wei or panda express, therefore not worth the wait/ tip/ expense."}
{"text":"Hmmm, we had the spring rolls and rice vermicelli with pork. None of it was bad, but not that good either. Portions were small relative to other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. The spring rolls had only 1 or 2 shrimp in them and the peanut dipping sauce was watery and bland. The main course was almost all lettuce with little meat or other garnishes. I will not return."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and had the vegetarian pho, veggie spring rolls, veggie egg rolls and garlic noodles.   The veggie egg rolls were perfect, but I don't think I'd bother with the spring rolls.  They lacked any distinctive flavor.  Not bad, but nothing that made my mouth sing, either.    The pho was, as others have noted, somewhat on the bland side, but I blame the vegetarian-ized broth.  I'm no pho expert, but it had simple, clean flavors, which weren't overpowered by too much saltiness.  The garlic noodles were slightly sweet and not overly oily, but the side order portion was plenty to share, especially with having noodles in the pho.  Service was fine and we were in and out in under an hour.  We'll be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time visiting this place. On my first 2 visits here I thought the food was fantastic.  This time it was very disappointing.  We had the Caramelized Salmon ($14), Vietnamese ribs ($15)and Crispy Shrimp Rolls (5 Pieces for $8).  The Crispy Shrimp rolls are not worth the price.  The rolls are so small and you could barely taste the shrimp in it.  I thought the Caramelized Salmon was a bad idea.  The Vietnamese Ribs were dry and portions of it were burnt.  I'm not sure I will be returning.  I noticed that the prices have increased since my last visit.  So on the positive side, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Cute little patio and good food. Servers are always friendly and attentive. I haven't tired a lot of the menu but I usually stick with shrimp fried rice or vegetable pho. Their Vietnamese coffee is my favorite-I get one every time!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives, banh mi and banh xeo were great. The other three dishes we got to sample, not too flavorful. Perhaps because we went at 2:30 pm and it's an off time (still no excuse) but the entrée dishes were bland with only 4-5 pieces of meat. Can I get some meat in flavorless sauce with my rice? Shesh.    Perhaps they should just specialize on banh mi sandwiches. We'll make the drive into town and continue going to Central for better Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This place had great food and even better service. I'll be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Love this place great food and fast service and really close by my home!!"}
{"text":"This place is over priced and the portion is sooo small.  It's not even enough to fill you up. The seasoning was off.  Certain dishes were too salty and others were very bland. I definitely would not recommend this place or go back to it."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice interior and pleasant servers. Seated immediately. Ordered Garlic Noodles. One with chicken and one with shrimp. Kind of pricey ($14.00 each) but saw that it came with house salad, Jasmine rice and a broth/soup. Noodles, as we ordered, came out first. Exceptionally good and very filling, especially for lunch. Waiter brought us the bill and behold, still $14.00 with NO salad, rice or soup. I asked when he brought back our receipt, \"wasn't there supposed to be a salad, rice and a soup included?\" He stated that they were expanding into the shop next door (formerly Cold Stone Creamery) and they were using the menus that they were going to use when they finished the expansion. Since they were still rather small they don't as of yet include what is on the menu with each order (EVEN THO IT IS PRINTED IN BLACK AND WHITE). All we got was a \"sorry for the inconvenience\". Will be checking with whoever is in charge of restaurants in the state of Arizona to see if that is deceptive advertising or any form of outright fraud since we were not informed when given our menus, or our orders were taken, that we would not be getting what we thought we were ordering. Have not decided if we would be back or not."}
{"text":"My family and I love this little gem! The food is absolutely fantastic and never disappoints. The servers are amazing, ask for Kathy to be your waitress though, she's wonderful!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a co-worker recommended it. Where do I start:  Customer service was phenomenal. I walked in and was greeted by the friendly waiter. My tuckus had barely hit the seat before I was offered drinks. It was the first time my friend and I had visited so we didn't know what we wanted. We took a while to view the menu, but as soon as one of the staff saw us put them down he came right over and took our order.   Together we ordered the crispy egg rolls (I've renamed them heaven egg rolls), house chicken wings and fried rice. If you couldn't tell by my nickname of the egg rolls, I'll spell it out for you. They were DELICIOUS!!!! The wings were great too, crispy and with just enough sauce, my friend said she'd never cleaned a wing like that before lol. Rice was good too. Overall very satisfied with my lunch today and I will definitely be visiting that place again."}
{"text":"Loved Saigon Kitchen...clean, friendly efficient staff, and amazing foood! Try the Spring rolls they are amazing!  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I have been here I think a dozen times now, maybe more, and have never ever gotten anything that wasn't amazingly good. Camelized salmon, garlic beef noodles, lemongrass chicken, pho.....it's all really good, but expensive! Oh, and don't forget the crispy eggrolls! They are probably one of the best things they have there, they are amazing ($5 for 4). Most of the dishes are $10-$12, the pho is good, not great, and is pricey at $9 for a large. It is a really modern type atmosphere with a nice bar. I think a lot of the price is paying for that. Summing it up: great food, high prices!"}
{"text":"Had Saigon fried rice on Saturday night very disappointed peas and carrots obviously frozen as they were still cold when served and the fried rice was very sweet."}
{"text":"This place is hidden diamond in Surprise. Wonderful staff, the food is always fresh. I have tried a few things off the menu and I have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Seigon Kitchen is an excellent place to eat. All the food is wonderful especially the sizzling cake.They make the best fish sauce I have ever tasted. I am always telling the very nice lady that she should bottle it. Great food and the nicest people you could ever meet. Go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I got the wrong thing, but the Pho was plain gross. I have a very long commute from Surprise to Scottsdale. There happens to be a kick ass Pho joint by my work \"Noodles Ranch\". I was so happy when Saigon Kitchen opened, but it was not very good at all, and it was rather expensive for the product. I might give it another shot and try something different, but in my first visit I was not impressed. The atmosphere was a little weird, but the decoration and general mood was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Fantastic, as usual!!! The new Avocado Spring Rolls were delicious. Can't wait to have them again!! The owners are awesome, as well!!"}
{"text":"What a great local fusion restaurant. Love the firecracker shrimp and lamb and pork specialty dishes. Garlic noodles are excellent. Appetizers are all good and a real bargain if you get there before six. Prices are reasonable, especially given the quality. Service is attentive."}
{"text":"Been here several times and this place is downright bomb! The atmosphere is casual and service is always on point. The pho is truly addictive. House wing sauce definitely qualifies as amazing in my book. Haven't gotten the courage up yet to try the drunken lychee fruit but I'm working on it."}
{"text":"This was an excellent restaurant for West Phoenix suburbs. It is not a white table cloth restaurant but the food is very good. I had the Spring rolls and Lemon grass chicken which was very spicy but wonderful flavor. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Saigon Kitchen is a very good restaurant with very personable service. The food from the appetizers to main courses are fantastic. My family looks forward to having many meals to come at this little jewel."}
{"text":"Not bad by any means but not great either. Spring roles were absolutely terrible but the pho tai and shrimp curry were excellent. The reason my rating isn't higher is because of the slow service. It took forever to get our drinks (not to mention even longer for a refill), our food and our check. The server was very friendly but we waited 30 minutes longer then we should have. I'll get food here again to go but never dine in."}
{"text":"As usual, we had a FABULOUS experience here!  We brought some \"newbies\" to Saigon kitchen and they had nothing but wonderful things to say!  My friends had the pho, shaken beef, and the short ribs, and I had my usual beef salad.  Super yummy!!!!  The staff is very friendly and always available if needed.  I remarked to one of my friends that they kept filling her glass while she was taking her last sip!  As always, I had the vietnamese iced coffee, which is a MUST!  So delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered for pick up today because I went on my lunch break. I ordered the vermicelli pork and egg roll salad Bun Thit Nuong, I get to my office and can't wait to eat my favorite dish! I was very upset that the main ingredient, the fish sauce mix was not in the container!! Now I just spent $14.50 for a meal that is incomplete. I called back to let hem know my disappointment, and all the girl could do was say sorry! That's it!! Didn't even ask how they could fix this! Now as I eat my plain, dry salad, I am even more disappointed! I can't knock the food, because it is wonderful, but the two stars are for the lack of customer service! Guess that's the risk you take when you order take out!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a pleasant meal here. Service was prompt and friendly.   Seating was relatively comfortable. We had a table not a booth - the latter looked more comfortable.  This is more a \"fusion\" restaurant rather than traditional Vietnamese. Not a problem; just an observation.  We asked for suggestions from our server. She recommended the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef which came with soup and rice and Firecracker Shrimp w/Garlic Noodles. These are two of their best selling entrees. We had an order of shrimp and pork Spring Rolls to start. Everything was tasty.   They offered interesting local and regional beers. We chose two and enjoyed them (sorry, forgot what they were).  Nice surprise in Surprise."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal!  Started with chicken spring rolls, filet with rice and the banana dessert!  The restaurant was clean the service was awesome and it had a steady stream of customers,  we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I ordered the Saigon Fried Rice and it was amazing. The staff was great, three different waiters were helping us and everything went smoothly."}
{"text":"Just had dinner very good food service was very good and friendly. We had lemongrass shrimp and beef pho soup. Will return to try more of the menu. All the orders passing by us to other tables looked delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing! The owner and staff is so helpful and knowledgable. They made recommendations for our party of 6 when it was our first time in.   Everything from appetizers to soup to cocktails to entrees was delicious. I substituted and got the garlic noodles instead of the rice that was supposed to come with my meal. Garlic noodle heaven.   Since then I have been back several times. My favorite it the filet mignonette and shrimp with garlic noodles.   Surprise needs more places like this. Small. Well priced. Great food. Different from anything else around."}
{"text":"Great food, very fresh, fun place!  Spring rolls are great  Give it a try for something different in Surprise  THANX"}
{"text":"Iced Coffee was PEFECT!  Service was GREAT! Food was EXCELLENT!  I hope to continue seeing this gem around Suprise!   The Pho is one of the best I have had in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"So amazing how many people on here gave this place 4-5 stars...... Wow, so easily fooled or have never had real Vietnamese chow before."}
{"text":"The food here was so good. I had lunch and I really enjoyed my food. Everyone was so friendly here from the host to the waitress. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food is excellent in this restaurant no matter what you choose for lunch or dinner. We have supported this restaurant since it opened and glad to have it in Surprise. To my disappointment, we visited Saigon Kitchen last evening Jan 25th, 2017 (Wednesday) at 5:15PM. There were many tables empty but each time we asked for a table we were told it was reserved or the table was reserved for larger parties. Keep in mind this is 5:15 in the evening, No one and no groups were lined up outside to get in, plus there were only two people sitting at one of the tables that was reserved for \"larger parties\" and they were not waiting for anyone as they already had there entree at the table. Due to no available tables, we were told we could eat at the bar- no thank you and we left. I am absolutely shocked that the owner or manager would let customers leave their restaurant due to the lack of customer service from their hostess who has no idea how to take care of customers. Does she not realize that her paycheck comes from customers."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open. The decor is really nice comparing to those Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix. Finally good service at a Vietnamese restaurant also. The food is great. I had the shrimp and pork springrolls. The dipping sauce was perfect with it. My hubby had the eggrolls.He enjoyed it as well. Happy hour was great. I had the bbq pork vermicelli and my hubby had the Pho. We both enjoyed our dinner. We definitely will return back."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the area. We would drive from other parts of the valley to eat here. Garlic noodles, firecracker shrimp, shrimp spring rolls, shaken beef, pho, grilled chicken  it's all good!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the second time since it opened. And just as impressed with the food. Hubby had the san tan devils brew on tap (they also offer four peaks on tap). Started with the crispy egg rolls. They serve them with fresh mint and lettuce leaves and encourage you to wrap the rolls with them. Yum! Hubby had the shaken beef and cleaned the plate. I had the caramelized salmon dish. We both really enjoyed the scallion broth that both dishes are served with. People of Surprise! Don't miss out on this restaurant! We need to keep them in business since we have far too few independently owned restaurants to choose from! Besides, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 because it saves me a drive to find other pho places.  Otherwise it would be a 3.  I always seem to get a wobbly table (maybe the same one 3 times?) not good with big bowls of hot soup, the music they always have playing is like a psychedelic Muzac and  the service is just ok.  It's probably just me, but I never get a good vibe from this place. I do like the pho and recently tried the Banh Mi with BBQ pork and although my sandwich could have used a little more meat, it was good.  The egg rolls are also very good."}
{"text":"This is one of mine and my husband's favorite restaurant! The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner for two. Their food is amazing! We practically tried the whole menu and would recommend all the dishes on the menu because everything is delicious but our favorites on the menu are the Vietnamese ribs, the beef clay pot and garlic noodles. I'm getting hungry just talking about it.  See you again soon Dennis!"}
{"text":"MY Family took me there for father's day. Everyone loved their food.  The service was great. The curry shrimp was out this World!"}
{"text":"Came in and was seated before a party of six, we were 3 adults and 2 babies. The party of 6 was seated next to us. The hostess took our drink order and I told her I was ready to order she said the bartender would be there soon to take our order( where's the real waitress) after waiting 10 minutes we finally got our tea and next to us got there drinks. I once again reminded the hostess and bartender we were ready to order now another 10 mins went by and the bartender went to the table next to us and took their order and completely ignored us! Horrible we all got up and left!"}
{"text":"Good place. The restaurant was clean and pleasant. The food was good too. My wife and I had the clear eggrolls with peanut sauce. We eat these whenever we have Vietnamese food. Fairly straight forward. Not bad. We also ate the combo pho soup. Very generous portions! Good job. The soup itself is reminiscent of fish sauce/mint/and some other requirement. It seems obviously made for American taste buds. It wasn't very spicy. You can do that yourself I suppose. But still for the inducted, you also require a more robust base to start with. If you want a more authentic soup, it is not here.   They had a small menu. Sometimes that is a good thing, as it helps from choice overload. However, there were some other Vietnamese dishes, I would have liked to see.  The service was friendly and quick. Overall they did just fine. We may return in time to see how they grow."}
{"text":"I have been going to Saigon kitchen since the day they opened. Food has been good great since day one. Menu has expanded and Dennis has taken this restaurant to new heights. I love the food here and the service is great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The best rack of lamb, the new sweet and sour wings are awesoms, the peppered shrimp, and always add a side of garlic noodles. The owner is an awesome guy, now if only he would open up a shop in flagstaff!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Wonderful food and service. One WARNING!  Dishes are serve too fast. Most of those around us, as well as us, got their entree well before they had finished appetizers, soup or salad.   Ask waiter to delay placing your dinner order until after first course is finished. Otherwise a five star experience."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch so I was very excited. Ordered goi cuon, grilled chicken sandwich, banh xeo/sizzling cake, and beef pho to share with my lunch date. True to Vietnamese dishes, vegetables were very fresh - bean sprouts, basil, jalapeños, and lettuce. Sandwich and banh xeo were delicious. Pho was average with a lack of spices in the broth. The rice paper for goi cuon was not soaked well and was hard in certain areas.   The service was also average. We were the only people there and it took longer than expected to get the food. Five minutes the first dish of goi cuon and 20 to 25 minutes for the pho and banh xeo. I imagine if there were a few more tables, the wait would be much longer."}
{"text":"The perfect Asian fusion, the smell alone will bring you in, but the flavors will bring you back!! Love the fillet, & pho. The owners really care & it shows. No other place I'll go for Asian food in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Take out pho not assembled...raw meat in container with noodles. Gross! Egg drop soup was neon orange. Everything else was just like any other greasy Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Eating at Saigon Kitchen makes my visits to Surprise, AZ even better and look forward to many more experiences at this establishment."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in Surprise.  My favorites are the Shaken Beef and Viet ribs.  Friendly service and clean place."}
{"text":"Any review using the phrases \"the meat is always tender\" and \"peanut sauce\" is sure to be a four-star review or higher, right? Well this one is.  My parents love taking out-of-town guests here and we have not yet heard a complaint from any of our visitors. The food has been pretty good so far, but I have avoided ordering the pho as what tastes I've had from my mother's orders didn't seem to be up to par with what I'm used to (and spoiled by) in San Diego. Well, it's not San Diego, but for a Phoenix suburb, it's still pretty good food.  In terms of wait service, I find it pretty baffling what poor service others have reported. We have generally had pretty great service at Saigon Kitchen, particularly from Hue, but once in a while some of their servers seem a little disorganized and distracted. During my last visit, I requested extra peanut sauce (even though it doesn't usually go with the dish I ordered), and the waiter told me \"No, this is the sauce,\" and pointed at the nuoc cham (dipping sauce). I told him that I understood but that I wanted extra peanut sauce. Finally another waitress with a little more sense told me that she could go get it, but I was just too annoyed by the other server who kept refusing a reasonable request - something my dad asks for and had just gotten a moment earlier, actually - that I told her I'd be fine. (And yes. I'm also childishly laughing every time I say peanut sauce. There! Did it again...)  Other than a few minor miscues, I really enjoy lunch here. The meat is always tender and all the ingredients seem fresh. I like the shrimp rolls quite a lot. On my last visit, I ordered Vietnamese iced coffee, and at first was disappointed because it seemed kind of small; after trying it I realized that it was just too rich to be served any bigger. I'd order it again though.  My favorite thing is the combo bun. Shrimp, pork, and egg rolls - can't go wrong with this one. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the serving size was ample.  One day I will have to order the pho, but again I don't think it will measure up to the hole-in-the-wall places in San Diego, and that's okay. I'll still come here with my parents and enjoy other dishes.  And the peanut sauce."}
{"text":"The Family and I have taken an interest in Vietnamese food.  After a horrible first experience about 6 years ago we have decided to give it another try.  The only other Vietnamese place we've eaten at, excluding the the place we didn't like and I can't remember, is Pho Avenia (which we like) and neither of us is well versed in Vietnamese cuisine so I can only review Saigon on my own standards of what I like and don't like. What I don't like: Booths.  I despise booths in any eating establishment.  They are always too low and my food ends up at chest level.  The backs are too far away and it makes my lower back hurt straining for support. Sadly for me, The Wife and The Boy love booths.  I have no idea why. Saigon Kitchen has the best of both worlds. . .table booths!  Kind of like the Spork of furniture only not as funny looking.  Everyone in The Family was pleased all around! The decor is nice (and new) and we were promptly seated at 6pm on a Friday night.  Our server came over and took our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.  My iced tea and The Boy's soda were brought to us promptly, but after about 10 minutes we flagged down our server and asked about The Wife's drink (some kind of fruity cocktail thing) Our server informed us the bar was a bit backed up but her drink was on it's way.  Although our server was smiling while explaining, it seemed to me it was through clenched teeth and I definitely got the impression she was imagining my death by asphyxiation at her own hands in her head while explaining this to me.  Not cool. I suppose I can understand though.  The place had filled up fast and the \"20 something\" hostess was sitting on her butt instead of helping out like she should have. We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer.  They arrived hot and crispy but they were just spring rolls.  Nothing outstanding, mind you, but at least they weren't greasy.  The Wife had the lemongrass chicken which I tasted and thought was pretty good.  Nice and tangy with large chunks of white meat chicken.  The Boy had Shrimp Fried Rice and I had the #1 Combination called \"Com Dac Blet\" which was basically Pork, more pork and some shrimp.  I tasted The Wife's dish.  Nice.  I tasted The Boy's dish, not bad.  Mine was outstanding.  Lots of meat and plenty of shrimp. All tender and cooked to perfection. I've heard the phrase \"I don't know art but I know what I like\" well I don't know Vietnamese food, but I know what I like.  I absolutely like what we had at Saigon Kitchen and will be going back soon to see what else I like."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on authentic Vietnamese cuisine, I just like what I like and I know when I like it. Let me remind you that this place is located in Surprise AZ. Your typical fare here is Chicken wings and burgers. I would say that no pho is terrible if the bean sprouts are crunchy, the cilantro is fresh and clean, and if the broth is hot enough to make you sweat like like a priest in a comic shop."}
{"text":"Went there with the family for Father's Day and will definitely go back again (just not with the family).  I ordered the Combination Pho.  Now it's been years since I had eaten Pho as there were no Vietnamese places near me.  I don't remember exactly how the Pho tasted at Da Vang years ago, but I know it was better than here.  But Siagon Kitchen's Pho was still excellent.  The meatballs are very tasty and the broth has a unique sweetness to it.  I would definitely eat this dish again.  My wife had a combination rice plate that was very good as well.  The biggest surprise was the chicken sandwiches that the kids got.  They did not like them (why I won't go with the family again), but I had them for leftover lunches for the next three days.  At $5 these are an absolute steal.  They are tasty with grilled chicken, diakons (a radish type veggie), cucumbers, carrots and cilantro.  These would be perfect to pop in and have for lunch."}
{"text":"Last Night, as usual, FOOD WAS GREAT.   Service not so much.  Had a reservation and was seated right away.  The restaurant was nearly empty but all of the occupied tables were crowded together.  There was no one seated at any of the wall booths or corners of the dining room.  I was bumping chairs with tables on both sides of us.  I guess the staff didn't want to walk to far to take care of the customers. Service was so fast I thought I was at a fast food restaurant.  I had not yet finished my salad nor started on the soup when they were serving the entrees.  Less than 15 minutes from ordering to entree.  Didn't have time to enjoy the beer or conversation with our dining companions.   Server was also off last night.  She served cocktails and just set them on the edge of the table so we served ourselves from there. We enjoy the food so much we will be back so hopefully last night was just an off night for everyone there."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese dinning.  The food was all very tasty and priced fairly. The owner personally visited our table and was genuinely happy to see us (my parents frequent this establishment).  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place to go post-Christmas!  Newer, clean atmosphere, and thanks to the yelpers, we ordered the firecracker shrimp. I loved these (good taste and quality shrimp)...the sauce was a bit much for my sister...the consistency of a sauce for honey walnut prawns...which is not what she was looking for. I gladly ate most of them!  The garlic noodles, while good, also seemed to be cooked with a LOT of butter, which I wasn't ready for and left a weird, heavy after-taste so we didn't finish those.  We also started with the fresh spring rolls that were delicious and their dipping sauce was good. Wish they kept siracha/other sauces on the table or brought them out right away with the food, but that is just a little thing.  Also ordered the combo rice--awesome! Totally missed we could have added an egg to the top-dang it! Good portion and flavor, and I love that they accompany it with scallion broth and a salad-a great touch.  When I am back in AZ, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Saigon Kitchen in Surprise AZ before and enjoyed it.  This time I ordered the noodles with filet mignon.  I could not chew it enough to swallow it.  I chewed and chewed to no avail.  I brought it home and cooked it some more but with the same result.  The color bothered me too.  It was not pink inside.  It was a bluish/red.  Could it have been another meat other than beef?  Perplexed."}
{"text":"Ordered to go two pho combos and one pho meatball. They said it would take 25-30 mins. By the time we got there it has already been 25 mins and we still had to wait an extra 15 mins before it was ready. When I got home one of the orders was wrong I got a beef stew instead of pho combo & my pho meat ball had hair in it. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Filet was amazing, and the Rock Shrimp blew me away!  Little siracha on the garlic noodles and I was in heaven! The pork egg rolls and the shrimp egg rolls are a MUST."}
{"text":"The food here is good, the pho with shrimp mushrooms and bok choy is great! The only complaint I have about this place is they don't have enough people taking orders.  Every time I have been there it has been busy, and they have only two people taking orders and one of them is the bar tender.  Keep up the great food but increase the service some."}
{"text":"My family and I went into the Saigon Kitchen last night for dinner. This restaurant is located in Surprise on the far west side.  First impressions walking in it's a really cool restaurant very modern the lighting was awesome and the tables were what I would put into my own home. We were seated promptly and our server took really good care of us he very attentive. Secondly the food there were eight people in our party and all said it was very good. In particular the dynamite shrimp my son had this dish. I sampled it it was amazing. I had the salmon when it was good. We also had a large bowl of pho  it was average at best.  I was also disappointed in the portion size. You pay on average $15 a plate but the portion sizes we're not much bigger than what you would receive for an appetizer. One thing that disappointed me as well  was all the staff were teenagers. It did not appear that they had a manager on staff the night we went in. Now I'm not saying I do not appreciate teenagers I have three of my own. But without supervision teenagers tend to be teenagers. We were seated right by the drink station.  That is where they would congregate and talk about their lives right next to our table. When you were spending $200 for dinner I don't want to hear who you're making out with and who you're dating. I don't care about your text messages. I just want to eat my dinner in peace  and enjoy my friends and family. It's just not appropriate. Generally I don't like to review a place after only one visit. I like to visit a few times before I decide whether I like the place or not. In this case I would return for the food for sure. Just maybe for special occasions or for lunch when they have reduced prices. Kind of scared to see what the lunch portions look like though."}
{"text":"I wish I had pictures, but Saigon Kitchen makes the best fried rice ever! My husband ordered the beef pho and loved it as well!! The customer service was amazing! They made feel right at home!  I visited a few weeks ago and now back home in Maryland. I think of the fried rice I had all the time and even tried another Vietnamese restaurant friend rice in MD, definitely doesn't compare!!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The Pho and ice coffee it's delicious! I recommend it. The only complain I have it's that it does take a bit of long time for your order to come out and the menus smell terrible.  They should cleaning with clean towels. Over all I give it a 4*"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best restaurant in Surprise. Went there on Saturday night. Modern atmosphere, local craft beer and amazing food.  Service was excellent. Justin was our waiter and he couldn't have been better. We also liked Andrew. He came to our table several times to clear dishes away and he was super friendly. Tried the Lemongrass Filet with shrimp, delicious!  My favorite was the Shaken Beef.    This is a place we will crave and be back often."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!!  Great food, great customer service and great pricing.  The owner Dennis has this place firing on all cylinders.  He has nailed the food quality and role models how all restaurant owners should run their business.  I had the Surf and Turf Shaken Beef.  Words cannot describe how good this dish was....an unbelievable sauce.  I highly recommend you visit this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the firecracker shrimp & garlic noodles! Was our first time here, but will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The pork bahn mi is fantastic, crispy egg rolls and the lemongrass beef stir fry with vermicelli noodles. ..very tasty! A huge compliment coming from an Asian."}
{"text":"I've tried other Vietnamese restaurants but none compare to Saigon Kitchen.  The food is amazing, the atmosphere is fantastic, the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful.  Thank goodness they're so close to home!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant many, many times and have never (ever!) been disappointed by the food or the service.  However, if you do not call ahead on weekends, you are in for a LONG wait at times.  (People...the food is THAT good!)  I always get the Shrimp Spring Rolls with peanut dipping sauce.  They're HUGE!  Two people could easily share one order.    For my main meal I have had the Fillet Mignon Shaken Beef, the Sizzling Salmon, the Caramelized Salmon, and the Firecracker Shrimp w/ Garlic Noodles.  All were equally outstanding and I truly have a hard time deciding what I want once we get ready to order.  I have no one favorite since they are all delicious!  My husband generally leans toward the Pho or one of the fried rice entrees.  All of those are equally delicious as well.  All specialty plates come with jasmine rice, a side salad and scallion broth."}
{"text":"Wanted a warm bowl of pho on this cold AZ day. Stopped in and order the hot tea to start. Definitely not your traditional tea served at some restaurants that is brewed in kettle and poured into small tea cups. No, this came in a tea bag steeped in a coffee mug. The decor right down to the presentation of the food has an air of modern/chic. The plate of accouterments (hoisin sauce, siracha, bean sprouts, etc) was compartmentalized on a plate and made it difficult to scoop both the sauces from it.   The presentation did detract from the normal, heaping portions of hoisin sauce that I dump into my pho. I decided not to ask for more thinking that I may have been overdoing it all of these years, but alas, I could barely taste it. I did order the large pho thai (thin cuts of steak cooked by the broth), but it only came with 5 pieces of meat that were a little larger than a silver dollar. I'd hate to see what I'd get with the small.   Overall, the noodles were cooked well and the broth was delicious leaving me thoroughly warmed. This was a nice place to have lunch and a welcome change from the typical caddy of chopsticks and soup spoons at the table with a diner style napkin dispenser."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times (not by my choice) and this place is mediocre at best, so I have no idea why so many people are giving them raving reviews. Let me go through my phoanalysis...  Pho: The broth is nothing to write home about. It's not terrible nor bland, but it's certainly not memorable. The meat, noodles, and vegs were fresh.  Spring rolls: Decent, but once again, not amazing. There weren't any mint in the rolls I had and the peanut sauce is disappointing.   Where the restaurant lost huge points with me was the inflated over-priced menu. The small bowls of pho are $7-8 and $8-9 for large, depending on which one you order. The bahn mis were $5-6, are you kidding me? And $5 for two spring rolls. It defeats the whole purpose of eating pho which is supposed to be cheap and convenient. Saigon Kitchen has more of a modern lounge feel to it, and that's not what I want in Vietnamese food. Focus on the food, not the decor.  Some bonus points for the bar. They have variety of beers on draft: Sapporo, Kilt Lifter, Blue Moon, Coors Light, and some type of pale ale I couldn't make out. There's a small selection of liquor available also.  Overall, I'm not a fan of SK. But my friend who lives nearby drags me there once in a while. I'd much rather make the trip to Central King Eggroll who has the best pho in the valley, so far, from my experience."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Surprise and best of all it's not to far from my house. I'm stationed at Luke Air Force base  and I've had tried many vietnamese restaurants  from coast to coast. Hands down this is ranked at the top of my list. It's clean, modern and the staff is friendly, not to mention the food is outstanding.   So far I've been there 6 times and won't stop, the food keeps calling me. The wife and kid love it as well.  Check it out, you won't  be disappointed."}
{"text":"In the greater Phoenix area places that serve Pho are hit and miss.  Saigon Kitchen is a 'hit'!"}
{"text":"Shaken beef probably the best thing chicken wings very dry suggest not to get the wings and pho ,spring roll are good too"}
{"text":"SERVICE IS THE WORST IN SURPRISE. Read more to get my story. I made this account JUST so I could rate this place. I went here - the first time, with my boyfriend. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. This is what happened: 1. We got our drinks.  2. Waitress asked for our order... we gave what we wanted for appetizers. After that, she immediately turned to another customer at the bar asking their order so we didn't get a chance to finish what we wanted for entrees. My boyfriend repeatedly said, \"Mam\", and \"Miss\", but she didn't notice us until after she took the other people's order. Even so - she didn't give us her full attention.  3. We received our appetizers. I ordered another drink.  4. 20 minutes go by and I still haven't gotten my drink, so I flag down a waitress and repeat to her that I ordered a drink and haven't received it.  5. I get my drink.  6. Another 30 minutes go by and we notice that people who ordered after us have eaten and are paying their bills. We flag down the waitress. 7. Confusion ensues, she says our order was in the computer... doesn't even ADDRESS us, talks to the cook.  8. We wait MORE, finally the cook apologizes to me, then comes back and asks us what we order and tells me that our food was delivered to another table. I said \"OK\". 9. We wait 5 minutes and I get my entree and bf gets his BUT IT IS NOT WHAT HE ORDERED. 10. We flagged down the waitress AGAIN and told her that he didn't get what he ordered and she gets the cook. He comes out and asks what my boyfriend ordered.  11. After my boyfriend orders, I try to talk to the cook and tell him that this service is unacceptable, it is our first time in this place and that the meal better be comped because we go to Pei Wei just down the way anyway... but BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE HE WALKED AWAY.  12. My boyfriend got his meal.  13. Waitress comes by, comps one beverage. Then, she makes excuses and she never apologizes. She tells us that they are just so busy and she has never seen it so busy, etc.  14. At this point, I am not even hungry. I tried to tell the waitress that we are unhappy and that it was our first time here. She shook her head. A few minutes later she said to us, \"Well was your food OK at least?\" Boyfriend said, \"It was OK, can we get our check.\" 13. She brought us our check... they charged us for everything and didn't even try to win back our patronage.   After such an AWFUL experience, I will never go back. I enjoyed the food but I wanted to have a romantic night out with my boyfriend and they RUINED it. I just got back and I am writing this review... Service was terrible in my opinion. They didn't try to win us back as costumers after REPEATED mistakes. I should have gotten an apology for EVERY mistake made, but I only received one apology, a cold shoulder (when the cook walked away when I was talking), a whole bunch of excuses, and one comped beverage.  I will never be back. I will tell all my friends to never go there. I make a newsletter for a resort in Surprise that over 2 thousand people read and I will make sure to never advertise for Saigon Kitchen and I will let as many people know as I can why they should NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.    We paid the bill, left. Wrote \"WILL NOT RETURN\" on the waitress's copy, left no tip, and left.   Thanks for nothing, Saigon Kitchen. That was the first and last time for me."}
{"text":"Been to the Saigon Kitchen 3 times now.  Once with a friend, another with my teenage daughter and other on a lunch date with my husband.  Will have to say have been absolutely pleased each time.  I ordered the Shaken beef (diced Filet Mignon) each time.  Husband ordered the Chicken Curry (which he liked) and we enjoyed egg rolls.    The food has been hot, tastes fresh, excellent presentation and absolutely delicious.  Portions, in my opinion, are definitely a good portion---just right.  Entree is served with white rice, soup/broth, and a tasty shredded side salad with a great Asian dressing.    Staff was polite and attentive, food came out in a timely manner.  Have thoroughly enjoyed my experience each time.   They play nice \"Global Ambient\" music, the restaurant is somewhat small yet cozy.  It has a nice \"grown up\" simple Asian feel.  Definitely a great place to meet a significant other or good friend to lunch.    NOT a place I would recommend for children; tables are somewhat close together and it has a relaxing feel.  Menu seemingly NOT designed with kids meals etc.  Also a bit expensive if considering price.  Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks, it came out to $39.    Worth the money, but if you are watching budget on a lunch date, just something to consider.  We definitely have listed this as a favorite place for us to dine sans kids!"}
{"text":"First time here on a Sunday and it will be our last. If I could give this place zero stars I would! Never will we step foot into this establishment ever again!  Please see below for my reasons.  1.) Food was way overpriced for what you get and it is mediocre food. I ordered chicken pho and when it came out I thought it was the kid's size. Do yourself a favor and go to a better and reasonably priced vietnamese restaurant, there are a lot out there folks! Really don't understand what all the hype is about this place. We are foodies and have had really good authentic vietnamese food and this place just does not cut it.  2.) Waited over 30 mins to be seated (arrived a little before 6:30 pm on a Sunday night) for a party of 5, not really part of the reason I'm writing this review since I do understand that they were busy when we came and we agreed to wait.  3.) We did not get our food until after 1 hour!!! We are only a party of 5. We sat down at 7 pm, server took our drink orders within 5 minutes of sitting down. 5 minutes later she came back with our drinks and we ordered immediately since we had over 30 mins to look over the menu while we waited outside. By the time we received our food after 1 hour, tables that sat down after us started to leave. I don't understand why we received our food so late as almost half of the restaurant was empty by then.   4.) We complained to a \"manager\" since the wait was just too ridiculous! The so called \"manager\" basically gave us a lame excuse of why it took so long and offered us a free dessert. We denied the dessert even though it was free as we just didn't want to sit at that restuarant any longer. However, if they were a restaurant that cared about their customers they would have offered us a discount or even to take off an appetizer that we had ordered but nothing of that sort! Also, throughout the time that we were waiting for our mediocre food, we saw the actual owner/manager go around tables checking to see, I'm guessing people he knows, if they were statisfied and never even once did he laid eyes on our table.  This restuarant not only did not satisfy my hunger but I left feeling angry! Also, after we paid I noticed other servers/workers looking at our table like we did something wrong... felt humiliated as we are not the type to complain. I've never been to a restaurant and experienced treatment like this...ever... McDonald's treats their customers better than this! Never again!!! Do yourselves a favor, please go somewhere else!!! There are a ton of wonderful Vietnamese restuarants around the valley!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5+ years and never miss it when I visit Surprise, AZ.  I have to say that I'm fearful that Dennis is allowing his standards to slip just a little.  A few things that seem to have changed: 1.  The Shaken Beef is my \"go-to\" order and has always been amazing.  For the first time it seems to have been top sirloin beef instead of the advertised filet mignon - or worst case, a lower grade of beef. 2.  Service seems to have slipped.  Very friendly wait staff, but bussers that would walk right by the table empty-handed without clearing empty plates.  Perhaps was just an oversight, but did not used to be the case. 3.  Lastly, the lobster tail special during the Thanksgiving week was a major disappointment.  Overcooked in the shell, could not get the meat free from the shell and when we did it was a bit dried out.  My future visits will continue because I just can't miss the fabulous flavor of Shaken Beef.  My hope is that the prior superior standards return - and soon!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Surprise and I'm glad the city is finally getting some ethnic choices, especially Asian.   I'm a huge fan of the Lemongrass Chicken, which is normally the only entree I order.  I've tried the Curry Chicken but it just wasn't for me, although my sister did like it.  My mother tried the BBQ Pork Sandwich and she found it to be a nice surprise, full of flavor and very satisfying.  Also tried the Wings (House Sauce) for the first time and found them delicious as well.  Although not a fan of fish, the wings did not have any fishy taste and were slightly sweet and ample.  The staff is very attentive and friendly, which is a huge plus in my book.  Will definitely continue to frequent SK!  My only grip is that one of the staff likes to park his truck in the first space in front of the restaurant.  Although there is plenty of parking, I just find it unseemly for employees to take up the front spaces, since these should be reserved for customers."}
{"text":"Drove to Surprise for lunch today and tried Saigon Kitchen. I had Firecracker Shrimp and Wife had Pho. We started with some eggrolls for an appetizer.  The Firecracker Shrimp was outstanding and I really liked the garlic noodles that they came with. I ordered a bowl of Scallion Broth and it was delicious. The salad that came with it was basic but the dressing was very good.  The eggrolls were not the best we've had and we actually didn't finish them. Not bad, just not the best I've had.  My wife said the Pho was just mediocre and the Pho places in Goodyear are better.  While we won't drive here for Pho we will be back for the other items on the menu. The place is a bit spendy but the atmosphere is nice and the food I had was very good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious.  YUM.  Fresh tasting peanut sauce on the spring rolls ... and delicious spring rolls.  It's small and the décor is trendy.  I saw kids there but if I were you I'd try to avoid busy times b'c it's not too big.  Good service.  A little on the expensive side but they serve a mean lychiejito."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We could not believe that we had driven by this place so many times and never stopped here. From the outside we always assumed this was like a Pei Wei... not even close! This is a very nice little place, atmosphere is great, staff is great, food is awesome. We had the shaken beef, firecracker shrimp, and the garlic noodles. All of them were just awesome. We've definitely found our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Used to love it, had the best shrimp appetizer around, now apparently they have decided to cut costs and the shrimp they are using have been reduced in size by close to 50%, same price,half the food,  When we asked about it, I was told that they use less batter.... wrong.  If you want to keep customers, do not save a buck at their expense. Posted pics comparing what they used to have vs what they have now, would rather pay an extra buck as opposed to getting something I could order at Long John Silvers.  Unfortunate."}
{"text":"We had shrimp curry and marinated grilled chicken salad. Both were excellent as was the service."}
{"text":"I do enjoy this restaurant, but let me be honest; I wouldn't say it's very authentic.  It does have great flavors and the staff is very nice.  I have been greeted by the owner on every visit and I appreciate how attentive he is.  I enojy going in for a cocktail and their pho good.  The regular size isn't as large as other places but it will leave you full.  It's fancy for veitnamese food."}
{"text":"Mix of good and not so great. Arrived at 6:30 on a Friday so expected a wait. Ended up being about 35 minutes. Drinks and appetizer arrived quickly and we ordered food quickly because we saw other reviews about a long wait. Did not get entrees until one hour after we ordered, and almost all tables had cleared out. Long wait, slow drink service. Crispy egg rolls were bland, stir fry was ok, but firecracker shrimp was amazing and well worth the price. Order some to take home."}
{"text":"A fabulous variety of Vietnamese food.  The Shaken Beef is my favorite dish.  It's filet with grilled onions, rice, soup and salad.  I have a hard time trying other dishes because I get the shaken beef everytime.  The garlic noodles and beef is awesome and the spring roles are a great appetizer.  We've been eating here since they opened in Surprise and it's one of our favorite places to eat out here."}
{"text":"Delicous!!  We had the shrimp & pork spring rolls (after dinner ordered another to-go!)  I got the chicken sandwich, amazing with carrots and cilantro.  Hubby got the Beef Pho, which he loved.  Heard about great happy hour specials like 2 apps & a bottle of wine for $20!  Can't  wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Love their shrimp spring rolls with mint. Garlic noodles are yummy, the Pho is great, and the pork sliders are amazBalls"}
{"text":"my wife and I usually go here every couple weeks. the severs are very nice and the food is amazing. I see the owner talking to some regulars all the time wish he would walk our way once in a while but I'm sure that day will eventually come. awesome place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with this place.  I had the filet pho, which was nothing to be excited about.  It hardly had any veggies in it, and the mushrooms made it taste weird.  The meat was excellent and so was the broth, however the small portion is very small for the price.  There are better restaurants to get more for your money."}
{"text":"I got the combination Pho. Super flavorful. Will definitely be back and will tell my friends."}
{"text":"Saigon Kitchen - 5 Stars  Location: Bell and Litchfield in Surprise. Very close to home. Plenty of parking and easy access back onto Bell Road. I need to come here way more often.  Atmosphere: Upscale and trendy, but laid back. Looks and feels like a Vegas restaurant. The patio seating looked very comfortable and inviting, but we wanted to sit inside. The music was ambient/trance. Reminded me of the Downtown Cocktail Room in Vegas. But with better lighting.  Cleanliness: Very clean and well organized. Even the restroom was nice and tidy.  Service: Cathy was very attentive and made several excellent recommendations. She kept our water glasses and our wine glasses full.  Food/Drinks: Delicious! The Chicken Noodle Soup was outstanding. I can't wait to go back and order it again. We also got Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls, Chicken Skewers, and Surprise Jumbo Shrimp. The dipping sauces were awesome. The peanut sauce for the spring rolls was pretty yummy.   Happy Hour: The Happy Hour food menu is from 3-6, but the Happy Hour for drinks runs from 11-6. Bargain! During Happy Hour you can get a bottle of wine and two apps for just $30. Totally worth it.  Price: Very reasonable. The large bowl of soup for $9 overfeeds two people. Good portions for the price."}
{"text":"The service is horrible here. I sat for 10 mins at the bar and I wasn't even offered something to drink let alone to take my order. The food is decent but over priced. You can find more authentic Vietnamese food in Phoenix or Goodyear for less $."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here which is why my family orders here a lot. When we sit down and it's busy we don't feel neglected. The staff makes no excuses to the fact they are busy and they work their butts off to ensure the guests feel like they're their only guest. Their food is also top notch. The Pho is awesome and their sandwiches are even better. They have also never made a mistake in any of my to-go orders placed in person or online. This is amazing. We come here a lot and we will keep coming back because we've never been let down."}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD. GOOD PRICE. NICE LADY.  Pho is great. Let me tell you, I am a PHOnatic and Saigon Kitchen has some great pho. The broth is very good and cleanses my soul haha.  Chicken Fried Rice is also good. Spring rolls were on point, Haven't tried anything else yet, but I will soon. Nice lady, too friendly."}
{"text":"So after watching a couple of episodes of Chopped I had a hunger for a banh mi sandwich. I search around for a near by location out in Surprise. I found that Saigon Kitchen had them on their menu. I was happy to hear they had them because we have eaten here before and had really enjoyed the food. From the outside Saigon Kitchen just looks like another strip mall endcap restraunt with some out door seating but when you walk inside you are taken aback. This place looks like an expensive upscale restraunt. As we entered we were seated right away. Our waiter Brian took our drink and our appetizer order. The ice tea was fresh and tasted great (im very particular about ice tea.) Our appetizer were the spring rolls with pork, shrimp and a peanut dipping sauce  which are a favorite of mine. Do yourself a favor and get these if you happen to go, you will thank me later. Now here is were my review goes south. Not because of the quality of food but because of the service. So we ordered the banh mi sandwiches and our waiter leaves to place the order in the kitchen. Five minutes later he returns, apologizes and says they have run out of bread.so now I'm very dissapointed. He hands me a menu and walks away. I quickly found the Saigon fried rice which has shrimp, chicken and pork. This fried rice is probably the best fried rice I've ever had, very tasty! Now I look up for my waiter and he is behind the bar with the rest of the staff. The place is not very busy and they are all congregating back there. I waited another 5 minutes before we could place our order. Our food comes out quick, awesome. As our server brings out the food places it on the table kind of drops the plate in front of my son and me as well and walks away. Didn't offer any chop sticks of even to refill our drinks. He goes back to being behind the bar with the other wait staff again. I had to ask two diffrent servers for chopsticks and drink refills. I guess our server was told that i complained he had nit checked on us so he brought out the drinks. Food wise Saigon Kitchen is on point and is easily a five-star place. But I had to take off two stars. One for not having bread to make the banh mi and two for the lousy service."}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh and cooked right. The staff is awesome and they keep the place super clean. My wife and I cannot resist their Saigon wings and garlic noodles!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice now, I went yesterday and last Wednesday, and I don't hesitate to say I'm blown away and frankly pleasantly surprised! The service staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy with a hint of a diner feel to it. And the best part? THE FOOD! Ohh the food! It was like nothing I've ever tasted. (And I've tasted plenty. trust me.) My group [4 people] got an order of wings with the house sauce, an order of trio skewers, a house combination sandwich, the chicken curry, and two filet mignon shaken beefs. No complaints the entire meal.. Which is rare if you know my friends. We left fat, happy, and ready for a nap!"}
{"text":"Loved their food. Servers are fast, efficient, and friendly. However, just read in newspaper that their \"rating\" was not too good as reviewed by food inspectors.  A couple things I read were rather alarming regarding food storage and cleanliness.  I will wait to see if rating gets better after another inspection. I am so disappointed because food was very good."}
{"text":"Had the Firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles this time and it was yummy."}
{"text":"I just moved into the Matthews-Indian Trail area and I was soooo happy to know that their was a local place that serves Pho and Banh Xeo (Vietnames Pancakes)! I met the owner and he was so friendly, told me it was family owned and operated so I know that the food is going to be AWESOME and it sure was!!! This will be my place for Pho that's for sure! If you've never  tried the cuisine, you should, it's very very addicting! And healthy! :)"}
{"text":"Saigon Kitchen is located on the southside of Bell in between Longhorn steakhouse and Red Robin.  It is very small and the decor is simple.  We went on a Friday and it was busy but still had a couple tables open.  We weren't greeted for a while and were starting to think this was going to be a bad experience.  An older man with grey hair was serving tables and walked by us several times as we stood at the front and didn't acknowledge us.  Another younger waiter also walked right thru the door we were blocking and wouldn't even make eye contact.  Finally we were greeted by a young lady and told it would be a few more minutes.  Our waitress Faith came up and was immediately refreshing and attentive.  A complete 180 turnaround from being ignored for the first ten minutes.  We ordered apps and drinks then we ordered our meals based on the waitress recommendations.  All the food coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled great.  First came the egg rolls.  Crispy and hot with lettuce, mint, and a dipping sauce.  Then came the spring rolls with marinated pork.  Fresh, cool, and awesome peanut dipping sauce.  For our meals my wife got the number one Filet mignon shaken beef specialty which was filet mignon with onions, a soup, salad, and rice.  The filet was tender and savory.  The sauce was excellent.  I ordered a pork combination rice plate.  It came with a pork chop, pork patties, and three shrimp, soup, rice, and dipping sauce.  It was good but no where near as good as my wife's dish.  The pork patties needed sauce and the pork chop was super thin.  Still tasty but i wouldn't order it again.  Our waitress Faith checked on us throughout the night but not in an annoying way.  She really was excellent and very good at her job.  We will come back again to try out more dishes.  I only can recommend the manager trains the other staff to acknowledge customers that are standing at the front doors looking like uninvited guests and are starting to feel unwelcome.  Other than that the food was excellent, the service was superb, and the price was reasonable for the product.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just the best Pho on the planet the service is amazing such kind servers and the food is unbelievable ...."}
{"text":"I actually like this place, a rarity for Surprise. The Place is clean, the waiters  have always been attentive and friendly. I usually order Pho. The do have A RIB EYE pho, very good. The spring rolls are good too. I usually come for lunch, and even though they are busy, I haven't wound up waiting for anything."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Surprise! Delicious Pho and spring rolls. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Customer service excellent and Pho is great! Really tasty spring rolls too!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Food is fresh, inventive, and creative. Service is good without being fluffy.  Their hot wings in fish sauce and the Chicken Vermicelli bowl are among my all-time favorite dishes anywhere.  I return at least once a week for lunch"}
{"text":"It's okay but nothing special - if other choices, I'd go elsewhere. I got the pho, and maybe that's not their specialty but I would think pho is basic enough to make well at a Vietnamese restaurant... The beef was kind of strange, and I would say the whole dish just wasn't very enticing. Also it was pricey for what we ordered. No appetizers, no desserts, water, a pho, and a pork chop dish - all well over $30. They also seated us right by the kitchen door, so it was an odd place to have a table. People were walking by all the time, but the worst part was the strange smell coming out of the kitchen. It was not appetizing and was a strange off-putting smell. It seemed to me a lot of people were there to sit at the bar. Yes, they had some customers at tables, but there were a lot of loud people at the bar and I felt maybe that is the allure of the place. I would only come back if I was having a bad craving for Vietnamese food, but there are other places around that have recently opened that may be better. Disclaimer: I am not a Vietnamese food guru or anything, and maybe we just didn't order the right dishes. I've had these same dishes elsewhere though, that tasted better."}
{"text":"5 star experience every time!!! Absolutely amazing food. This is without a doubt our favorite restaurant. Thank you Siagon!!!"}
{"text":"Only 1 Star based upon my review of the PHO  i've had great Pho over the years, this is not one of them. I wanted a Large bowl of what i'm used to, loaded with beef, tendon, brisket -- the usual house special etc. this is usually provided at every great Pho eatery in and out of the States.  Yesterday I ventured into this place while traveling and dialed it up from my Android, and there were several choices in Surprise AZ, I chose the first one at the top of the page...due to alphabetical order etc. Anyway I ordered the house special, which was brisket, meatball, tendon,  etc. The sizes here are small and large only... The small bowl is 8 dollars, and the large is 9 dollars, I thought that the prices were pretty steep, I thought the quality better match the price.   When my bowl of Pho came to the table,  the large here looked like a small in my other experiences with \"great Pho eateries\", with that said this is NOT a \"great Pho eatery\" I'll get to that later...  Anyway I thought this must be good, for nearly 10 bucks for a bowl of Pho which I have never paid that much before. The broth was very bland and tasted like it needed more beef flavor, spices etc.  I had to add everything to it to make it have any taste, usually this is the test of any Pho restaurant is the Pho base, the base is the \"money maker\"  if the base is good usually everything else is good. Also, The Pho had very little meat, I couldn't believe that I paid 10 dollars for just a few slices of beef, the meatball was tough and had no flavor and less than to be desired,   Needless to say I will never visit this place again. I felt robbed, and felt that I could have spent my money elsewhere...There are too many other great Pho places to eat at unless they improved their product, increase value & lower their prices, I will never go back....  Saigon Kitchen - You get 1 Star.... your Pho failed Big Time!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for an authentic take in Vietnamese food! I had a bowl of \"combination pho.\" It either comes in a small or large size. I got the large size and it was pretty big.   The prices may be a little high but with the quality and the service they provide; it's worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Had a jalapeño margaritas, different but great. I tried it while we waited to be seated, it was busy but only because of lunch time."}
{"text":"Good Pho, Good hot plate beef dish, good fruity dessert, good sake bombers.. its all good. Im glad they open close to where i work. This place will definitely be my regular lunch and booze stop."}
{"text":"I was going to be in that area, so I searched the web for a new Vietnamese place to try. Upon walking in I was impressed with the over all  decor and style of the place. It has a nice outside eating area as well. I ordered an appetizer of pork and shrimp spring rolls and the combination Pho. I waited for my appetizer to come first, and was not happy when I finally was served with both at the same time. The spring rolls were very good and fresh, the peanut sauce was excellent. My soup was a large bowl with plenty of meatballs, beef and tendon, very good flavor. I began to prepare to add the basil, sprouts and jalapenos to my soup, when I found a string of hair, entwined with my fresh sprouts. I almost lost it. When I mentioned and showed it to my server, he quickly sent for the manager in the kitchen. He said he was very sorry and hopes that I will come back and offered me free desert. I told him thank you, but I have lost my appetite. He said okay, and walked away. I was ready to pay and was not impressed with the customer service from the Manager. My server then came back and said, he was sorry and did not charge me for the spring rolls. Oh why thank you. I love Vietnamese food and have been to few in Phoenix, with cheaper prices, better service and although may not have as nice decor, I do not think I will return to Saigon Kitchen. I recommend Pho Than on 19th Ave & Camelback."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, and super fresh ingredients! If you want really good food then you need to try this place."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!!  I mean if you want RUDE people, nasty service and overpriced TOO HIGH menu items go here, otherwise stay far far away. Also the owner is extremely rude."}
{"text":"It was delicious and the service was great! My boyfriend and I started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls which had an amazing peanut dipping sauce. We also had crispy shrimp egg rolls which were very tasty as well. We ordered one of the specials which was the shaken beef with shrimp and garlic noodles. The seasoning was tasty and the meat was cooked perfectly, so was the shrimp. Everything was delicious. We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I'm cautious when a Vietnamese restaurant gives you a linen napkin with spoon and fork instead of chopsticks. Too expensive for small portions. I had the cornish hen for lunch and I'd definitely be hungry if that was all I had for dinner (same menu/portions for lunch and dinner).  The bird itself tasted pretty good and authentic, but I still can't swallow the price for $12.  I actually picked it because other dishes on the menu were even more overpriced (pho/rice/bun) than they should be and my people are known for being cheap.  The pho bowls also looked very small and I can't comment on taste of other food. Spring rolls did look fresh but $5 for two?? No way, jose.   I've noticed \"ethnic\" food is pricier out here, so It's fine for the market in Surprise, but any real Vietnamese will know you are being ripped off.  But then again, we'd prefer cheap, stellar authentic food in a shitty location over a pricey, modernized, spotless restaurant with a bar - which this place is. I guess the money has to go somewhere. Seems like they are having good business, so good for the owners. I probably won't be back on my own dime."}
{"text":"Love this place, I always get my pho fix at this place. I love the casual atmosphere and relaxed feel. The food is delicious and the spring rolls with the peanut sauce are to die for!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny!! Shaken Beef with Garlic Noodles and Pho were amazing!!! Very classy and clean!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Saigon Kitchen is my favorite restaurant in the West Valley. I love their Pho as well as most other dishes I have tried. For that reason, I was disappointed with my last meal there and have to give them four stars instead of five. We usually go for dinner, but decided to try it for lunch one afternoon. I ordered the chicken curry, and it came out with squares of slightly dry chicken that did not seem very fresh. The same was true of the peas and carrots. My husband had a Vietnamese sandwich that he raved about, so I think my curry must have been the result of an off day. The service was excellent, as always. Despite one disappointing dish, it is still my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've ever eaten in I love the food there I love the owner she is the sweetest woman and a great cook so if you're looking for  great Vietnamese food stop by here you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"First time at SAIGON KITCHEN. The atmosphere is very pleasant and cozy. Pretty nice crowd for Monday lunch time. The veggie eggrolls were crunchy delicious. The vegetarian Pho with vegetarian broth was a bit sweet. The fried rice was tasty but too wet."}
{"text":"My husband loves the salmon- the house grilled chicken is good too. There's not a lot on menu for GF-- I tried the curry chicken/rice bowl-- flavor was amazing, but the chicken, peas and carrots where all previously frozen. Don't understand why!?! If this dish was made with their house chicken and fresh peas and carrots it would be amazing!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over here, and it was quite good.  The inside was not at all what I expected; it was very nice, trendy, and clean.  I somehow expected it to be a bit like the coffee bean that was previously there, but it was nothing like that, good.  The food was quite good, not sure exactly what I ordered, but the waitress helped me to decide based on her recommendations.    Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not our first time here and it won't be our last. The place was packed tonite. This is the kind of restaurant that deserves to be packed... Not the same old assembly line chain restaurants.  We waited for a table, and waited a bit longer than usual for our dinner, but it was well worth it! And our awesome waitress Faith gets a big thanks for her excellent customer service, and not just with us. She was very busy but never stressed and didn't let you feel forgotten while waiting for dinner. She even gave us dessert on the house for waiting so long. As for the food... Excellent as always!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! The food is delicious and flavorful. They even have a great beer selection but if your like me you'll go for the Sapporo which is on draft as well! You seriously can't go wrong eating here. Special thanks to the owner Dennis for the reccomendations! You rock!!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and food! Restaurant is trendy-good music, good atmosphere. The pho is delicious, best I've had in Surprise. I also like the shrimp spring rolls and the house combination sandwich. The Vietnamese use mint in such different ways than we use in American cooking and Saigon Kitchen does it well."}
{"text":"Great food good service and fair prices we had fried rice which is much than Chinese fried rice, and all other entrees we very good we will be going back."}
{"text":"Fresh, friendly, and fab!  Our party of 4 split: crispy egg rolls, combo pho, chicken clay pot, sizzling salmon, and a side of garlic noodles.  The food was very tasty and our server was so helpful answering questions and providing tips, along with a array of side sauces, so we could customize heat levels.  I love the fact there is both indoor and outside seating."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I am never disappointed. The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and overall is always a great experience. Their house specialty, the shaken beef, is an absolute must to try. Definitely give Saigon Kitchen a visit if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Eggs rolls, Shaken Beef and Chicken Pho are amazing. This is my favorite restaurant in Surprise. It is not over crowded or loud and they have excellent customer service."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely good, but not great, or amazing. The menu has a fusion feel, not really Vietnamese, but based on it. I had the curry chicken, which had a good flavor but lacked any heat at all. The potatoes were rubbery, as if the stew had been sitting around for while and they used square carrots and peas. It's just a personal thing but my mom would serve us frozen bagged peas and carrots growing up and so they made the dish feel cheap and mundane. My hubby had the steak and shrimp dish, and for $16 he got a little bowl with a few beef tips and two shrimp. Again, flavor was good, but the meal as a whole was a disappointment for the price. Hot green tea was a cup with a tea bag. No teapot. Classless. For a $39 bill we had no left overs. Call me a spoiled American but for a tab like that for lunch, it would be nice if left overs came with it!"}
{"text":"Okay, I drove out to this place because of the yelp reviews.  I order several items just so I could get a taste for a few things.  The Banh Mi as everyone before me has reviewed was really good. Very fresh tasting and the pork had a wonderful flavor.  I will be back for that.  However, I ordered the lemongrass beef with rice noodle and was sad to see that beef lacked any real flavor and the noodles were so overcooked that they were mushy. (yuck!)  I saw they had a shrimp fried rice (isnt that chinese?) so I ordered that for my boyfriend at home.  It came with a light pink shrimp sauce that was pretty good. (like the one you get at hibachi spots) lots of big shrimp but it really needed that sauce. The spring roll was pretty good also.  I will go back but not for their noodle bowls, havent tried the pho yet but update when I do."}
{"text":"Fun and Delicious. Another fantastic restraunt not in Goodyear."}
{"text":"A little pricey, noisy, small dining area, but great food and definitely worth all the negatives"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and had a great experience. Staff was great and so was the food. The Saigon wings were excellent and so were the crunchy egg rolls. My wife and I both had seafood salads which were also excellent.   Quality ingredients and preparation. Will be going back to try more"}
{"text":"Not only is this a beautiful spot but the inside is so calm and nice, I know that I can just sit back and relax my food here without any problem. This is very good and the costumer care is amazing! Good price, great food= Happy me! I recommend the Pho with beef!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! I'm so glad my Mom and her husband took us here when we were visiting last month. The service was excellent and the food? I'm salivating just remembering it. My Mom was surprised to see they'd expanded it since she was last there but I only know it as it now stands. It has a clean, cool and laid-back vibe which was perfect for our evening out. They do have high chairs...but there's no changing table in the ladies room. Luckily they had a table that was the perfect size so I moved the items off of it, put down my mat, changed the little guy, and put everything back as it was. That's my only complaint but since we had something to work with other than the floor I'm totally okay with it. I'm guessing there aren't a ton of babies in the area per se, but probably a fair amount of grandkids who may visit.   My Mom insisted we get the crispy egg rolls (we had the vegetarian ones) and they were DELICIOUS. We also ordered the chicken skewers as half an appetizer and half an entree for my son, they were also deliciously good and full of flavor! I was bummed we were leaving the next day and couldn't bring our leftovers with! There were 3 Filet mignon shaken beefs ordered and one Sizzling Salmon and everyone left stuffed and satisfied. I know my Mom will continue to enjoy this spot and whenever I'm back in town I'll be adding it to my list of \"must-do's!\""}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on our first date night in quite a while.  We saw the Saigon Kitchen on Check Please, AZ.The decor was modern and warm!  The food was amazing, everything, even the salad.  The service was friendly, and fast!  Ignacio, our waiter, was personable, polite, and very good!!  I had the Rack of Lamb with garlic noodles and loved it, I also ordered the Pho.  I can't describe how much flavor the broth had!!  Thinking of making it our regular Friday night!"}
{"text":"Man this place really fell apart...Sat and waited for 15 minutes to get our order taken and Josh the waiter took our order and never came back...I had to go to the bar and get our waters refilled. The Pho barely had any meat in it, and just lost its good flavor all together....really disappointing....."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner New Years Day and it was packed. I have to say \"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!\"  The service is excellent the food is amazing. Always fresh and so very tasty."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Always make me wait a very long time! Serves other tables that come after me, until I say I have been waiting for a long time. Love the food though !"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. I have never had a bad experience here. The food is all amazing, prices are great, atmosphere is wonderful, and all of the employees are awesome. I am a big fan of their pho and my husband loves their fried rice, but we have tried other menu items and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"On our recent visit the food was very good, the service not so much. It was over an hour after we ordered before we were served, and we didn't order anything exotic. The service has been slow here in the past, but this visit was off the charts. They comped our appetizer as an apology. I like this restaurant and hope they are able to solve their slow service issues."}
{"text":"Dear Egg Rolls, how I do love you here at Saigon Kitchen. You are delicate, flavorful, and SUPER HOT. It's hard for me to wait when you come out of the kitchen but I MUST because you burn the crap out of my mouth otherwise. :) Love wrapping you up in a leaf of lettuce and mint leaves. Love dipping you in the wonderful sauce. You complete me......  We also enjoyed the vegetarian pho today and my son had the filet mignon beef stew. The meat in the stew was so tender it just fell apart. It was perfectly delish. The pho is what you make it to be! Add the fixings and make it what you want it to be and stop complaining about it being bland. It's SUPPOSED TO BE!"}
{"text":"Went back here for lunch.  Last we dine here the service was great and so was the food...not so much today. The waitress took for ever coming over when we first sat. We ordered our first drinks, they took long. Our apps came at normal rate. So did our food. However, if my husband and I hadn't gathered all the used up plates to make sure wAitress removed them, they'd still be sitting there as our main course was almost finished. We then ordered wine for our main course and we watched the full glasses sit at the bar for at least 10 minutes with not one of the waiters walking by them bother to figure it out and bring them over. Waitress finally brought them over and still didn't remove old empty glasses. Mind you there were only like 3 other tables, it's not like they were packed. So on top of the slow bad service, I ordered a pretty expensive filet mignon platter. The salad was just ok, but I promise my filet was just stew meet cooked medium. If u see my history I love love steak, so I can tell u it's not filet...some horrible super tough chewy piece of beef.  The small amount of rice that came with it was not worth it either. So I don't know what happened since the last time was such good experience. Today was entirely horrible. I think I could deal with slow bad service if...IF...the food would've been edible."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The staff (Dennis, Faith etc...) rock and make sure you have all you need and a great experience. You literally cannot have anything bad here. I recommend the Shaken beef and Garlic noodles. The ONLY thing I can remotely say is not 100% is the PHO broth. I attribute this to me living close to little Saigon for years and developing a taste for a strong broth. Other than that, and that is my own preference... I LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Yes!  Yes there is a Vietnamese fusion restaurant in random as hell Surprise and it is absolutely phenomenal!  Definitely wait for a table if this place is packed because it will be well worth your time and patience.    I can't help myself when it comes to their ginger garlic chicken wings.  These things are flash fried to absolute crispy perfection.  You will want to lick your plate clean after sucking it off your fingers first.    My favorite dish to get each and every time I've been in is their firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles.  This dish is what dreams are made of by far!  The noodles are not too strong and are best companion to the crispy shrimp served alongside them.  I never have any shrimp left over, because that would be blasphemy, but having the noodles for leftovers the next day is always a treat.    This last time I went in, it was packed to the gills...but we waited it out because my gf had never been.  The owner recommended his sweet and sour ribs for her and just like the chicken wings...they had this nice crispiness to the outside and juicy on the inside.  Your food does take a while to come out, but that is because every thing is made completely fresh and not placed under any of those lame red lamps."}
{"text":"I get the Shaken Beef every time I come here! It's very fresh & better than at any steakhouse in AZ!"}
{"text":"Hooray! One of my two fondest wishes for Surprise has come true - a Vietnamese restaurant! Now all we need is an Indian restaurant and I can quit being pissed off that I committed to owning two houses in this boring little section of Phoenix. Tried it out this evening with the wife and kid. She was a little hesitant because she doesn't really go for Vietnamese, but I'm a pho fiend and when I learned that we have one of these places locally I HAD to go see.  First impression of the place: it's very neat and clean - to be expected since it's pretty new. They're going for a Scottsdaley urban vibe or something, I guess.. bar/stool area plus tables which overall reminded me of Tokyo Lobby a little further down Bell. Not a bad thing as long as the grub measures up too, such as is the case at Vogue Bistro. The wait staff were very attentive. A little too attentive, actually - we were pinged about six or seven times while we ate by two separate waiters, but of course that's better than being ignored. Customer feedback #1 - refill the glasses automatically without interrupting our conversation to ask, please. As always, I ordered the pho dac biet (special beef and noodle soup). The wife had the Saigon Rice (BBQ pork, carrot, pea, shrimp [she asked for no shrimp, though], rice and egg) and shared it with our toddler. She also had the spring rolls. I hate those things, they always remind me of intestines filled with worms for some reason. But anyway. The kid, after a little coaxing, had some rice, noodles (extracted from the guts of one of the spring rolls) and satay sauce. He didn't mind it. Wife ate her fill and also didn't mind it. My pho was hot and tasty but I have some criticisms. Positives first: it was piping hot, the broth was very tasty (marrow bones boiled longer in it, or perhaps more beef stock?), they served lemon pieces instead of lime (listen carefully, other Vietnamese places: there's a difference, and lemon is -better-) and I didn't have to beg/gesticulate for a fork. Now for the low points. Dac biet should be served with flank, tendon, brisket and TRIPE. There was absolutely no tripe in my soup. I fished for a while, then asked one of the wait staff, who advised that they do not include tripe in that dish. Fail. Not a big fail, but what I'll call a \"Bombay Spice\" fail (those people who have been to Bombay Spice in Paradise Valley expecting 'actual' Indian restaurant fare will know exactly what I mean here). Customer feedback #2: serve your pho dac biet with tripe and let customers dictate whether or not you should continue doing so, rather than the other way round. Second, I got a measly palmful of bean sprouts on one of those long square plates, hardly enough for a single bite. Third, instead of a bottle of Sriracha hot sauce on the table there was a doll's-house-sized dollop of it on a tiny square dish. Now, I don't actually put Sriracha in my soup, but EVERYONE else I know does so it's a valid point for analysis AFAIC. Yes, I know I could have asked for more sprouts and in hindsight maybe I should have, since otherwise how would they know about the fails? And finally, just aesthetics - at the beginning of the meal I was forking around in the bottom of the bowl looking for some noodles, didn't find them, then seconds later realised why - the noodles were all clustered on the other side of the bowl in a huge semi-stuck-together wad, basically as though they had been emptied out of the packet as a brick of vermicelli and then not stirred at all as they were boiled. I soon separated them with my fork.  $9 for a large pho dac biet that was missing a traditional ingredient. Not a spectacular price considering what I got. I was still hungry and had to mow down on my wife's leftovers before I was satiated. So to speak. My favourite Vietnamese in the valley is still 43rd Express (http://www.yelp.com/biz/43rd-express-phoenix) at 43rd Ave and Thomas. Go try a bowl of THEIR pho and see what you get for your dollar. Saigon Kitchen gets three stars flat. Nice and average in the scheme of things, with Cold Stone Creamery next door being a definite plus. I am judging them based on the other VN restaurants I've eaten at across the entirety of Phx. I'm certainly not going to especially fawn over the place because it's a zillion miles closer to me than the nearest other VN restaurant. But, I'll definitely return and we'll see whether they improve over time. I got an extra star in my pocket just for them if they do. Very pleasant decor, completely unexpected for a place that serves this kind of cuisine. Usually you got linoleum, plastic tables and a coupla dead roaches in the corners. For the moment, in order: 43rd Express, Avina's, Nam Sao and then here. I'm kinda glad they censored my review of 43rd Express, actually. I really like that place, it's just that I wrote my review after travelling 20 mins to get there only to find it closed.. on a TUESDAY. Anyway. I'll quit waffling now."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment, I had the charbroiled shrimp Bun tom nuong  & my friend order the shrimp Pho rau tom. The shrimp was over cooked and there was no flavor, it was like water with a very very very slight hint of what it should taste like for both dishes.  I was hoping to find a close Vietnamese restaurant and was willing to pay the higher price for convenience. However I will drive the extra miles to Pholicious for better food and prices."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese restaurant.  Portions are good except for the beef short ribs, which were meager.  Recommend that the restaurant install filtered water system for table water.  Local water from the tap does not taste good and adversely affects the taste of the food."}
{"text":"This is the best food I have eaten in Surprise AZ. If I was 100 miles away I would drive the distance to eat this heavenly food. The service was awesome. Price was reasonable. And the food was mind blowing!!!  I could eat here every day.   I will tell everyone I see about this gem in the desert of Surprise."}
{"text":"One of the best in town. My family and I love this place! Awesome environment, we love to sit outside on the patio. My 3 year old LOVES the pho and so do I. The shrimp spring rolls are also amazing. Everyone is so friendly and makes it a even more enjoyable time."}
{"text":"When I saw A couple of 3 star ratings, I wondered if a competitor sent \"ringers\" in to knock it down. My wife and I ate there for the first time today and were blown away by the quality and flavors of the foods. I average 160-200 business travel nights a year throughout the 48 States and eat at both chains and local restaurants. Saigon Kitchen is a must go if you want to experience great food, and the dinner items are reasonably priced in the 10-12 dollar range. If this will be your first time eating at a Vietnamese restaurant expect to be pleasantly surprised. It is a fusion of French and Asian cuisines unlike anything else. When the last bites of food taste every bit as good as the first ones, you just know that you will be coming back again and again.   Some people rate restaurants by how high the food is stacked on the plate. We did not walk away either hungry or stuffed because the portion sizes are sensible. Another plus is the staff. Our server Brianna was both friendly and efficient and everyone there was friendly. We intend to go back again and again to explore the different menu items. If you like Asian food, you would be hard pressed to find a restaurant with tastier food than this place. My review is unsolicited and we are not related to the owner(s?) in any way."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here 4/22/18. The soup that came standard with many entres had an utterably strange and indescribably unattractive flavor. All 3 at our table concured on this. In addition served luke warm. Another entre was also warm. Perhaps the warm food was the fault of our waiter rather than the kitchen. This place seems to have a wide variety of ratings. Perhaps some patrons are really having such different experiences. Or maybe expectations are lower! Spring rolls hot and decent."}
{"text":"Is it cliche to say this lil restaurant in Surprise, AZ \"surprised\" me ! I could eat the edamame all day! Crispy egg rolls are succulent. Weird word I know.. .But the flavors are full!  I'm at dinner with friends and the smells are making me changing my mind. Graciously they offer me bites! Beef... Pho... Fried rice!   This is brilliant!"}
{"text":"Table service was without spot or blame, flawless from  entrance to exit. Their Menu is filled with a vast array of food options. From pho, noodles, shrimp, steaks and salmon, they got it offered and at a reasonable price.  Smartly ran kitchen offering exceptional food with exemplary service. We Frequent here regularly and it's never a disappointment. Thank you Saigon Kitchen."}
{"text":"If you like pho this is the place for you! I like they give you options. Lots of great food. Service is great and accommodating. The pepper steak is one of my favorites as well."}
{"text":"Having lived most of my life in San Jose, I am very familiar with Vietnamese food.  SK is more Asian fusion than Vietnamese and that serves it well in Surprise.   The dishes are fresh and flavorful. Whether you decide on a rice dish, noodles, or soup, your taste palate will thank you.   This is a trendy cafe type restaurant with a full bar in the dinning room. Great selection of beers on draft to compliment your meal.  I usually have the San Tan Brewery Devils Pale Ale and find it complements everything well.  Service is usually great here as well.  They are eager to answer any questions and are excited for you to enjoy their great food.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians, beware--the \"vegetarian pho\" as listed on the  menu is not vegetarian.  It has chicken broth in it.  I didn't know until after I ate it, and then ordered it during another visit when the waiter thought to tell me it wasn't really vegetarian.  I've asked them about it and requested they not call it vegetarian when it isn't, but it hasn't changed.  I wanted to like this restaurant..."}
{"text":"We were coming back from a Sedona road trip, and decided to check out the new 303 freeway that intersects with the I-17. It was new and we weren't familiar with route, so we went exploring and wound up on Bell Road, heading east.  We were in the mood for Vietnamese food, and didn't think that Surprise had any good ones, and we found this place. And we were quite astonished.  The decor was quite modern and somewhat elegant. The service was superb, and the other patrons were just extremely friendly. There isn't a lot of room here, and tables have a tendency to be situated rather closely to your neighbors. In fact, the group next to us kept asking us what we were eating so that they could order the same thing.  We are fairly adroit in our Vietnamese food ordering so we partook of the standards as a matter of comparison. This means Goi Cuon (spring rolls), Thit Ga Xien (skewered chicken), Pho Tai (Steak in Noodle Soup / Broth), and Com Suon Nuong (Char Broiled Pork Chop in a Rice Plate).  Our verdict (granted it is only our opinion) - it's good but too tame. In our experience, whenever we encounter Asian Fusion, it normally seems to entail neutering the dish so that it is less spicy. Again, just an opinion based on our experience. I had to add a lot of siracha sauce to bring it up to a spicier level, but you may have a different preference.  Overall, its a good place. But, if you have friends that are Vietnamese food fans, they may be slightly disappointed with regard to the difference in the level of \"spice and kick.\""}
{"text":"Great food, clean place, super nice staff. What more do you need. Owner stopped by table to say hi. Thank You folks!"}
{"text":"First time trying Vietnamese food and it was awesome! The customer service was great, she talked us through most the menu and helped us pick out what we would like. The egg noodles was delicious and the pho soup was too!!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Just had the shrimp curry, awesome, wife got the filet mignon salad that was fantastic, my daughter got the filet and shrimp, amazing.  Try it, service is good, not great but the food is awesome and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Surprise . The staff is helpful and friendly , the food is very good , fresh and healthy. They have a vegan menu and can make accommodations for any dietary restrictions. Definitely a gem on the west side ."}
{"text":"This was mediocre at best.  Service was rushed.  Food was so so.  I had the caramelized salmon. The meat was tough with a hint of fishy smell. The soup came out lukewarm and the salad was uninviting.  With four stars I was very disappointed with the menu and service.  I plan to stop at McDonald's for a big Mac."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat when we vacation in Phoenix. Food and service are first class. Shaken Beef and spring rolls are a favorite!!"}
{"text":"Very nice Vietnamese food. . Service can be slow at times but that doesn't prevent us from returning when we want Asian food."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. The food is very good. First off, the Pho is solid. The broth is a bit sweeter than I am used to but that doesn't take away from how good it is. The meat is higher quality than the other Pho places in Surprise. The bowl was decently sized and filled with meat and noodles. I've also tried the Vietnamese curry and it is fantastic but comes in a very small bowl. I just wish there was more! Anyhow, I would definitely go here more often but it is a few dollars more than the other places.   I've been here twice in uniform and both times the owner thanked me for my service and hooked us up with a free appetizer. The service is excellent and the waiters/waitresses are on top of their game.   The restaurant is very nice inside with a more upscale look and feel. Also, it is very clean."}
{"text":"It's Surprise, AZ right, who would expect to find a quality vietnamese restaurant?  When in town, I always order up the pho (nice flavorful broth and ingredients) and a bbq pork banh mi.  Service is friendly and can get on the slow side.  One night I placed an order for pickup was told the wait was 2 hours.  That's ok, I still ordered pho from them the next night.  It seems family run which is a nice touch. Support local when you can.  Can't wait to get my pho on when I'm out in sunny Surprise."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants and was excited to take my girlfriend to this one near her home in Surprise. 1:00 on a Sunday. We were seated and finally noticed at least 5 min later. After having plenty of time to go over the two menus, I was sure hoping everything was going to be worth the few extra bucks everything cost compared to every other Vietnamese restaurant I've been too! Sure the place looks great but good \"customer\" service and fair quantity and quality of food plays in as well. I ordered the Combo, Com Dac Biet, charbroiled pork, (ground pork patties?) kinda weird, Grilled pork chop, and shrimp served over a small portion of rice. My girl ordered the Bun Ga Nuong, Vermicelli bowl with Charbroiled Chicken it was tasty but the chicken was very dry. It took us a minute or two to taste anything as we didn't have any silverware and had to catch someone to bring us utensils...swear the waitress vanished. The real problem was when I was about halfway done with my meal and I still had lots of meat but no rice...I swear I got shorted on rice! So I finally made eye contact across the restaurant with our waitress and nicely asked her while pointing at my plate with at least 6 bites of meat left on it if I could just get just bit of rice to finish my meat with, yeah I was thinking like just a small condiment cup of rice would do it, right? Wrong guess...about 5 min. later a different waitress comes out with a rice mold on a plate, not a huge amount but at least twice as much as came with my $14 meal. I asked her if I was going to be charged for a side of rice ($3) she said she wasn't sure but thought so and I kinda chuckled and said really? She said she would go ask our server about it and was gone with the rice in a flash. I was sitting there thinking maybe I should have just taken it and been happy with my $17 lunch plate that I usually get at other restaurants for $9...naw!!! I had just about finished the rest of the pork by the time the \"manager\", a kid about 18 came over with the rice at least a good four minutes later and asked what was up...we went over it again and he was adamant that if I wanted more rice I would have to pay for it. I said of course not, we were just about done anyways. Never saw the waitress again and had to flag down this \"manager\" a few minutes later just to get our bill. I was a waiter for years when I was younger and have never stiffed, until today! Whatever happened to customer service? At least trying to please your customers so they might come back? I'll stick to the non-\"Hoity-toity\" Vietnamese restaurants from now on."}
{"text":"Great people, great Pho and a very nice restaurant. I have been eating Pho for 40 years and am very picky about it. The broth is everything! They have several speciality items that really complete the menu. The Vietnamese ice coffee and leechy drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Great food, upscale atmosphere, exceptional service.  What more could you want.  Our party of 4 chose pho thru curry dishes so saw a wide variety.  All were pleased.  Appetizers were also very good.  Portions were large and prices were fair.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but the service was mediocre. My boyfriends food came out 10 minutes earlier than mine and it took the server 5 minutes to notice. By the time mine came out his was pretty cold."}
{"text":"Last night was my second dine here and my second Bahn Mi here (2nd Bahn Mi anywhere).  If you are a sandwich fan and a fan of Vietnamese BBQ Pork and fixings: Cucumber, Daikon, shredded Carrot and Cilantro -  No Mayo PLEASE (I remember to tell them to skip the Mayo)!  Also I had a side of Grilled Cured Sliced Pork and an order of Fresh Rolls with Shrimp and Pork with Fish sauce!  Service and Food Fantastic!  Note: Most of there food is Chinese and understandably as they are still a new business and more locals will recognize favorites and hopefully the Vietnamese selections can increase over time - The Owners are here and are very friendly and outgoing!"}
{"text":"I noticed slight changes since my last visits. The website has been removed and I saw a different person who maybe was in charge?  They didn't bring us all the sauces with our spring rolls this time but my main reason for lowering them a star is because the chicken in my meal was terribly dry.  I remember the lemongrass chicken was wonderfully tasty here so I thought I'd get it again. It still was tasty but I have no idea how they made the chicken so dry. I usually give places two stars for extra dry chicken because that shouldn't be done when you go out to eat in my opinion. It's so easy to cook chicken when you get very dry chicken it's disappointing.  The chicken in the spring roll was dark meat and was OK but not like fresh made good.  Maybe it was just a slightly off day? don't know?  Slight update, New Website"}
{"text":"I think the food is very good. Been there about 6 times since the open and by far my favorite is Shaken Beef.  Agree about spring rolls - just not good.  Pho I think is very good.   Not impressed by the girls they hire or at least how they allow them to dress. Yes this will sound sexist but it us a semi nice restaurant and the attire allowed by female staff just doesn't fit. Jeans a size too small. T-Shirts a size to small and the girls constantly showing skin when she has to pick up anything including ass crack and thong - not something I need to see before eating. It isn't sexy it is nasty. And she is wearing a plain white T with pink bra. What is this a restaurant or strip club.  And flip flops. Really?  Management really needs a dress code that reflects the atmosphere for staff.   So now I just get stuff to go."}
{"text":"The food is great, probably the best I've had in Asian food.  The owner takes great pride in his creations and we love going there."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Surprise, Arizona. In a city built on national chains, Saigon Kitchen is the little beacon of independent freedom. Servers are friendly, owner is friendly, food is delicious. Both the shaken beef and the clay pot salmon are two of the best meals I enjoyed during my years in Arizona."}
{"text":"A new favorite! The food was amazing! I had the surf and turf shaken beef and shrimp. The beef was delicious. It came in a skillet like fajitas but in this amazing sauce with mushrooms and caramelized onions. It also came with a bowl of broth which was out of this world amazing. Super flavorful. It also had rice and a salad with it. The salad was delicious! I can't say enough about how delicious all of the food was. The service was a little lacking. BUT the food was so good I didn't care so much about the service."}
{"text":"I have been to Saigon Kitchen a few times now and always leave pretty happy.  The wait staff is very polite, decor is chic and the food is good.  Is it authentic?  I don't know what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.  I just know that the food here is good.  They give decent sized portions and the price is right.  The spring rolls are good, but I prefer their calamari with the aioli sauce.  It's really nice to see a non-chain restaurant in Surprise."}
{"text":"Okay so I have been here a couple times now. The first time was to pick up pho, which if you eat pho regularly then you know it's never really good when you get it to go. It's just not the same. So it's nothing against this place or any place for that matter. But I have had both Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee here and they were good. (I've had them before though). I've gone two weeks in a row for my pho craving. It tastes pretty decent here and let me tell you, I'm pretty picky where I eat my pho. But I'm glad I found a place near my house so I don't have to travel across town just to have it. The service is good too. It's usually pretty mellow there too, which I really enjoy. It's not too noisy or too quiet that it's weird. Oh and don't even get me started on the dessert.. they have a sweet potato cheese cake. OH MY GOSH is it good! I could've eaten the whole slice by myself it was so good. But I split it with my best friend. I keep craving that too. And you can only find it there. They don't have that at the Cheesecake Factory. Anyways, go and try. Definitely try the dessert and if you like coffee, try the coffee or the tea."}
{"text":"Our visit here was excellent from beginning to end. The service was very good and so is the ambiance. The food is amazing and you get fair portions. It's all very fresh and flavorful. The menu has some depth so I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some other creations."}
{"text":"just left saigon kitchen  had a bad experience which will not bring me back  discovered a white single hair in my shrimp  told server which she gave a generic apology and i ask for the check and left  i wouldve at least expected a manager to speak to me and apologize but didn't happen.  Server gave me the check I paid the bill and left."}
{"text":"I love the food but it seriously ridiculous when you order take out you have to pay extra to get the sides that usually come for free with the menu item. And they don't tell you prior to ordering."}
{"text":"I don't like Asian food but this place changed my mind.  I asked the server the difference between Shaken Salmon and Caramelized Salmon.  He informed me the Shaken was made with their soy sauce and other ingredients.  The Caramelized was sweeter and made with molasses.   Even though the dishes were not delivered at the same time everything was served hot and stayed hot.  The salmon was sizzling on top of sliced onions and cut into 4 pieces for the serving.  The rice, soup and salad where served on another platter.  The dressing was lite for the salad and the soup was hot and excellent.  The rice was shaped like a large patty and I had leftover rice from the dinner.   The service was great and the server asked if he could remove dishes instead of just taking them off the table.   We went a little earlier than dinner time but when we left the place was beginning to fill up with customers and each was greeted in a very friendly manner.  I hope to return here in the near future."}
{"text":"Love this place. Used to come here frequently about a year ago, then sorta fell away (we live about 30 min away). We were in the area and decided to grab a late lunch here. As we remembered, food is great! Comes out sizzling hot (shaken beef is the best!) and the pho... so good!  Evelyn was our server and she's awesome! Very attentive without being annoying...seems most servers don't know how to strike this balance. We always had what we needed without realizing half of the time she had even been there.  Great job SK- we will start making the drive again more often."}
{"text":"Delicate flavorings, beautifully presented, good value. try going during an off hour"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Surprise, which isn't very hard to do because surprise is full of nasty chain restaurants. However, if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food, this is the place. The pho of any type is amazing, even to go. Also try the spring rolls. Make sure you wrap them in the lettuce with a bit of mint, the texture is bomb fool! It gets a little crowded around 6pm because all of Sun City eats dinner around that time. So show up around 7pm and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Just moved to Surprise from N Peoria and I'm so glad I found a great PHO place! This is definitely more upscale than your typical Vietnamese restaurant and I love it!   Last week I had the filet mignon pho with shiitake mushrooms and bok choy. Must try! Everything paired very well together (Md $14). Today I had the steak pho. Made it extra spicy with chili oil and paste. Another great dish (Md $9).  Service was great and the overall look/feel of the restaurant is a perfect place to take a date! Patio at night with some candles... ooo yea lol!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Especially since the West Valley is filled with nothing but chains and sub par restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Has been since the place opened. Now its even bigger."}
{"text":"We really liked this place.  The service was good, food was really good.  We we're expecting the servings to be a bit bigger but it left us plenty full by the time we were done eating.  Fresh and flavorful food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here over 40 times. I love this place. Every time I go in I'm amazed. The quality of the food is amazing. The owner, Dennis, takes pride in every meal. The employees are very happy to work there and are very welcoming. The Fire Cracker shrimp with garlic noodles is my new favorite plate."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, my only critic was that we waited an awful long time for our food. But overall for the very first time eating at this restaurant was a very good experience."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for Pho!!  Delicious!!!  Friendly, clean...a little pricey...but worth it for yummy food!  We go here at least nice a week.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"For the price the quality fell short in comparison to other Vietnamese pho in part it lacked in freshness including the meats. Also, the combination rice or vermecilli plate is no go-the meat being over cooked tough and dry.  The ban me however was a good choice. The service staff was pleasant and courteous."}
{"text":"Restaurants have tried and failed to succeed on the \"west side\" of the valley, but Saigon Kitchen has been a proud staple of the city of Surprise for years now. This accomplishment is the result of the hard work and dedication of the owner and chef, Dennis, who is a true visionary in every sense of the word. He never settles. He always thinks of how he can improve, which results in a menu that constantly evolves.   The Shaken Beef is the prized entree that was featured in Phoenix magazine. Ask anyone who goes here, and they will recommend Shaken Beef. You really can't go wrong with the tender high quality beef filet marinated and served sizzling over onions and peppers and flavorful spices. Sometimes people become so accustomed to ordering this dish though, that they forget all the other great food!  My friends enjoy the caramelized salmon clay pot dish. The salmon is served sizzling in a clay pot bathed in caramelized garlic glaze.  They also tend to order the Firecracker shrimp with noodles and have trouble ordering outside of their comfort zone once they try this.   The Cornish Hen - this is prepared just how my mom used to make it when I was growing up. It's a comfort food for me. The outside is thin and crispy and the meat is still very soft, tender, and full of flavor.  Surf and Turf fried rice - not sure if this is always on the menu but it's the same beef filet as in Shaken beef combined with shrimp in a vegetable fried rice.   Combination Pho - Contains steak, meatballs, brisket, and tendons in noodle soup, topped with onions, basil, jalapeños, bean sprouts.. you name it!  Salmon Pho - a modern take on pho but with the rich salmon belly!   Combo spring roll - crispy egg roll (similar to lumpia) inside of a fresh spring roll. Another modern twist!  Salt and Pepper Shrimp - my favorite appetizer featuring lightly battered shrimp with jalapeños and onions. A newer menu item that will most likely be a restaurant staple  For dessert, the tempura banana with salted caramel ice cream is such a treat! It can definitely be shared with someone since it is rich but who wants to share anyway??  Rest assured, all of the menu items are msg free and extremely fresh and high quality ingredients. I'm sure many regulars agree. That's why we keep coming back - amazing food, great service, and the chic ambiance is rare for restaurants of the west valley. If you haven't been here, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese food, but way to expensive. $9 for a Bahn Mi sandwiches is crazy ridiculous. Still the food tastes good, and the atmosphere is enjoyable. It seems to be a popular spot. I'll go again, but you have to know it's speedy for what it is."}
{"text":"Saigon Kitchen is not representative of Vietnamese food. I have tried it three times and have yet to have any dish that is authentic Vietnamese. For Vietnamese food, I'll stick with Pho Viet Nam or Saigon Pho in Chandler --- where more realistic Vietnamese food can be found.   Anyone who calls this great Vietnamese food simply has never tasted real Vietnamese food. And any vet who says this is just like the food in Nam was, I can assure you, either high or eating at the base.   Calling Saigon Kitchen Vietnamese food is as bad as those that call Olive Garden Italian food or Red Lobster seafood."}
{"text":"Go here if you are looking for a new tapeworm or stomach bacteria that will ruin your life.... Was not impressed."}
{"text":"So let me tell you about my journey with this place, I live about 20-30mins away and I made a special trip up to this place on a Sunday, to find out that they were closed. Pic I submitted. I was not a happy camper about that. Anyway, my husband was coming home one day the next week and I asked him to stop by a pick me up a banh mi. I could not wait to get my sandwich, so I was very disappointed once it did. The flavor and texture just was not right. I could not take more then 3 bits switch was to bad because the herb salad on top was very fresh.   I might have to go there and eat in house"}
{"text":"A nice little find in Surrpise!  Nice dining room and some cozy outdoor seating.  Service was great and the food delish.  We shared the Saigon fried rice and the shaken beef. I'm sad we have waited this long to try it!  We will be going back...a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! The menu is so full of delicious dishes. The prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. Andy was super helpful and nice. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're really in Saigon. Don't miss out on this great restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Six of us from our Meetup-Plant-Based/Vegan Dining Club West Side, had lunch at Saigon Kitchen today.  One of our Meetup members recommended that we go try it.  To my surprise, I had heard that they even had a vegan menu.  The food was DELICIOUS!  The lemongrass broth was amazing on the Tofu & Veggie Lemongrass Rice plate. I asked for extra veggies instead of tofu and was so pleased with extra veggies and sliced portobello mushrooms. All six of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  Three in our group order the PHO and loved it.  Our waiter was great!  Service was \"spot on\".  We didn't encounter any problems.  Although we opted to sit inside vs the patio, the indoor decor was very relaxing and welcoming. We're definitely going to plan a larger party there real soon.  They tell us that we can book a private party on the patio.  Looking forward to taking my husband and daughter there for dinner some night.  It will be worth the drive."}
{"text":"Beef filet minion Lunch was the most amazing lunch ever! Can't wait to go there for dinner! Super clean restaurant with a great menu. I'm going to order lunch for my entire team this week and see what they think as well. I am super impressed myself."}
{"text":"Great pho. The noodles can become too soft quickly- so slurp that pho up fast! The egg rolls rock, and the owners are as nice as can be. Please check this place out for the pho and banh mi. This place deserves a look if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Just finished another great dining experience here! Had something new at the owners suggestion... Salt n pepper shrimp ... Delicious! This is served with jalapeños and sautéed onions.  Needs to be added to the menu!!! It is an appetizer but they are thinking of making into an entree item too. Try it out .... Yum! Of course everything there is wonderful. You can't go wrong at Saigon Kitchen"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time ever. Great food, top quality and friendly attentive staff. I had the clay pot with shrimp. The food came out sizzling and it was magnificent. In my opinion, this is the highest class restaurant in Surprise. I'll definitely be going back here more often! Thank you Saigon Kitchen."}
{"text":"So I've been passing by this place for sometime now, and finally I've built up the courage to actually stop in and try it. Needless to say, I would like to know where I can sign up to be a regular here! This place, the staff, the food, and experience was absolutely amazing.   I came here for dinner to try the Pho since I've heard a lot of good things. I started by ordering a kilt lifter beer and the infamous spring rolls. These spring rolls were a huge hit for me! Extremely refreshing and the taste was more than imagined. The dipping sauce that come with the rolls had a peculiar taste that seemed to be addicting. I have to give two thumbs up for the spring rolls! I ordered the Surf and Turf pho (which is not on the menu) the waitress Faith told me about the hidden menu item, and it sounded perfect for what I was craving. Once I received the pho I had this sense of excitement and astonishment, by the preparation/ presentation of the whole course. (Laymans term: it looks cool and came with a lot of sides to customize the flavor. VERY FUN!) The broth had a great unique taste, which kept me in wonder how they did it! The Pho here is worthy for anyone to try. I would recommend it for sure!  Once I was finished with my pho. Faith(waitress) asked if I would like some coffee with liquor in it. It's sounded amazing when she described all the stuff they put in it. I told her\" YES, I want one of those!!\" Once I tasted this cup of coffee, I thought to myself...\"does this place have anything that is bad about it? I can't seem to find it!\" Long story short.. The coffee was brilliant! It's not on the menu and doesn't have a name yet. I told Faith, they should call it \"Kung Pao Coffee\" If you should choose to try this coffee. Ask Faith, Dallas recommends the Kung Pao coffee. She will know what your talking about. Haha    So obviously my experience is worth five stars.. Since this is my first visit here, I would like to witness the same kind of experience and customer service on my second visit for the fifth star to evaluate accuracy of it all.   I will be visiting you again Saigon Kitchen! Mark my words. Haha Great job!"}
{"text":"First time in the place and stopped for lunch. Service was okay and had the firecracker shrimp with noodles for $15, thought it was worth $5. Guess he has to pay for the remodel. If you like the food, then I guess it's worth paying for it, not me."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've eaten here quite a few times and love going. The food is always fresh and tasty. I love their spring rolls, pho, and banh mis. My family is Vietnamese so I thought I'd be daring and bring my grandma here one day. She liked it, but said it wasnt as good as hers....and I do agree.....BUT its a great substitute if grandma is taking the day off :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go! The staff is so nice and my food is always so delicious! I've taken family there and they all love it as well!!"}
{"text":"I have been several times now with my girlfriend and her friends and it never disappoints. I always get the Shaken surf n turf. I would say\ add some more shrimp but overall its awesome. Great taste and flavors. Also have tried the garlic noodles, wow."}
{"text":"So excited they finally have a good Viet restaurant in town. I ordered the Pho Thai so did the boyfriend, we also shared the crispy egg rolls which were amazing. My son had the chicken fried rice. All was amazing. I would say however they give you rather small pre-squeezed helpings of Hoisen and Sirracha. I like to add a ton of both to my soup and made due with what I was given. Other wise it was very clean, the staff was great, the soup and egg rolls were amazing and I would highly recommend the chicken fried rice for the little ones. My kiddo devoured it. Give them your business so they stick around. Fun atmosphere, nice bar, great food, great location, clean bathrooms and cold stone next door if youre craving a sweet treat after."}
{"text":"I love this place they have really good food and I always get great customer service. I always get the same thing when I go and that's the chicken pho which is best I had so far"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Vietnamese and the Saigon Kitchen came up on Yelp, so I figured I'd give it a go. The restaurant is small (20 tables or so), very clean, and has a upscale feel without being pretentious. The tables are very close together, so if you're looking for secluded booths for intimate conversation, it's not a great choice.  My companion and I decided to start with the marinated pork spring rolls which were served with a delicious peanut sauce topped with chopped peanuts and julienned carrots, providing a little extra crunch to the fresh cucumber within the rolls. Four portions were delivered, chilled nicely without being cold and contrasting very well with the warm marinated pork inside. Use of mint in the rolls was understated and allowed the flavors of the other vegetables and the pork to shine while still providing a needed brightness. Overall, a solid start.  I'd been craving pho for a while, while my companion was in the mood for a rice dish. We decoded it would be \"combination night\" and ordered the small combination pho, containing \"steak, meatball, flank and tendon\", and the combination rice plate featuring a grilled pork chop, charbroiled pork and charbroiled shrimp served over jasmine rice.  The pho was accompanied by the usual condiments of bean sprouts, basil, a lime wedge, and jalapeño along with sriracha and a sweet and sour sauce that was very similar to hoisin, and topped with onions and cilantro. The broth was delicious, and the proteins were well sliced and cooked perfectly, but the tendon was the star and was melt-in-your mouth tender. The small portion was a perfect size for me, and the hoisin-like sauce added an almost vinegary acidic tang, different from fish sauce, that I hadn't had in a pho before. Delicious dish.  The presentation of the rice dish was simple, artfully done, if a bit busy on the plate. A circle of rice was stacked first with the pork chop, then strips of charbroiled pork and topped with the shrimp and some scallions. A bowl of house fish sauce vinaigrette, a bowl of scallion broth, and a simple green salad; a larger plate would have really kicked the presentation up a notch, but I'm picking nits. My companion loved every bite and cleaned the plate. I'm trying this dish next time.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable, delicious meal, and one I thought was a steal at the $25 price we paid."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Miss Saigon - The Heat Is On In Saigon)  The heat is on in Saigon!  The sauce is sweeter and hot Five of these stars here will be for Saigon Gosh, the eggroll is hot, not to mention the Pho!  The heat is on in Saigon!  Is there a review going on? Do ask, and I'm going to tell   I was asked by Chef Dennis Tran to attend his restaurant when I first met him at Slanted Rice in Scottsdale; his sisters restaurant.  To be honest I wasn't sure what to expect since I generally don't venture out in the West side too often.    I went with a fellow Yelper, Jennifer H. to check it out.  From what I heard this place is pretty darn good.  Saigon Kitchen has received multiple accolades and write-ups from your everyday Yelper to local news like AZ Central and national recognition from Trip Advisor.  Needless to say, I was quite excited to have been invited by owner Chef Dennis!  Saigon Kitchen is very spacious restaurant with a full bar; different compared to your average Vietnamese restaurant.  The place was popping with patrons as I can hear a buzz of chatter!  I sat with Chef Dennis and he offered to order for us a plethora of appetizers and entrees.  He also introduced me to his General Manager & Marketing Director; Andy Tran and Brian Garcia.  Both of these gentlemen were transplants to Arizona and been in the restaurant business at a very young age.  Andy & Brian are very young; in their early 20s, but ambitious fellows from what I gather.    Let's jump over to the food cause that's what we're here for.  Chef Dennis laid out a spectacle of dishes for us:   Coconut Shrimp: Deep fried encrusted coconut shrimp; very crunchy and the smell coconut is alluring. I love coconut!  Chef Dennis assured me all his fried food was cooked in either sesame or olive oil...not your traditional canola oil.    Tempura Battered Shrimp: Like what the name of the dish; its tempura batter shrimp and came with two sides of sweet & sour sauce and chipotle.  A crunchy bite and a kick of spice with the chipotle sauce; great with some beer as I ate!  Eggroll wrapped Spring Roll: As simple as this may be, why didn't anybody think of this earlier?  I love texture and the eggroll definitely provided that with the subtleness of the spring roll.  The eggroll was Chef Dennis's mother's recipe and yes indeed; mom does know best here!  Saigon Chicken Wings: Chicken wings deep fried and doused with their house sauce, but the bulk of the mixture was definitely sweet and sour sauce with a hint of Siracha.  A decent bite since I generally enjoy my wings naked and adding my own sauce.    Saigon Stir Fry: Fried noodles with choice of meat, ours had Cha Sui & Shrimp mixed with carrots, onions, mushrooms, cilantro, bok choy and bean sprouts.  Love fresh fried noodles with fresh vegetables and the scent of cilantro.  Aromatic and fresh crunch gave this noodle entree and addicting bite!  Rack of Pork with Garlic Noodles:  Pork chops with a seared with garlic noodles.  The sauce was sweet and the pork was slightly charred giving it smokiness.  The tender pork was cooked just right with a little pink and the garlic noodles were again aromatic with the sting of garlic -- This was definitely my favorite!    Surf & Turf Shaken Beef: On a hot sizzling platter filet mignon & shrimp with mushroom and onions with a side of rice.  This dish was as delectable as it sounds...love the sizzle caramelizing the onions bringing out the scent with the filet was uber tender.    Salmon Pho: This was salmon belly cooked with pho broth; totally blew my mind how good this was!  I never thought of adding salmon to pho since it doesn't wound right, but at Saigon Kitchen Chef Dennis is innovative and playful with his dishes.  This is currently not on the menu but let's just say stay tuned!  We ended with Saigon Dessert, tempura banana with organic honey and cinnamon; we also added coconut ice cream to it.....YUM!    Chef Dennis has no training as a chef and has acquired his love to cook mainly from passion.  His mother was a former top chef from Tokyo and her teachings was his inspiration to be a chef and restauranteur.  His dream is to expand among the valley with sister restaurants with different concepts catering to local Phoenicians.  Chef Dennis is definitely ambitious like Andy and Brian salivating at bringing the love of Vietnamese fusion style food to the valley.  Needless to say, they were all humble from where they began and never forgot that.  They love what they do, but know it takes a daily grind to make their dreams come true! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not great, some choices were on the bland side. Thought portion size was small for the price. Not used to paying $60 for Asian food for two. Not sure if we will return"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and so is the service. If you make it during holiday season, you should try the salted caramel martini. Yum!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!!.Try the Vietnamese fillet mignon sandwich. Or the shaking beef it is awesome. The sandwiches only $10 and you won't believe how it tastes"}
{"text":"We actually really liked this place but it's a bit overpriced, in my opinion. I would love to see a wider range of happy hour specials, especially on sushi! The decor looks out of place for Surprise (this is NOT a bad thing, I welcome it). We need more authentic cuisine here, so I hope they soon bring in competition. I hope this place is successful!"}
{"text":"Decent food but struggles with service every time.  I visit this restaurant at least twice per month because I like the pho.  I've had better pho elsewhere but it's the only option out this way and ingredients taste fresh.  The servers are very kind but each time there is some mistake that renders the meal extra slow.  I know mistakes happen and am very forgiving but an acknowledgement and very basic apology would go a long way sometimes. (e.g.  I'm sorry, we had an error so your soup was delayed, we'll get it right out as soon as we can.)  I'll be back again I'm sure because sometimes I just need some soup!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars to Saigon Kitchen.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is clean and modern.  We both love the carmelized salmon - it is absolutely to die for.  You get a generous serving of salmon in a delicious sauce, cooked in a clay pot.  The meal comes with soup, salad, and rice and we always end up bringing some home.  It's unique and a great addition to Surprise!  Try it - you'll love it."}
{"text":"Maybe this review is a little unfair since I am from the San francisco bay area where Vietnamese food is authentic, amazing, fresh and dirt cheap but I can't help it. I LOVE Vietnamese food and I was craving it and was thrilled to find this place on yelp! Bottom line I got rectangle cubes  of processed pork... That is almost sac religious to me. If it says meat it should be meat- strips, slabs, pieces not processed mystery meat cubes... Especially Vietnamese food!! Not enough cilantro in anything.... The salad was good but would have preferred some fresh cucumbers, lettuce and picked radish to dip into my fish sauce... Maybe they are trying to modernize Vietnamese food... But it's hard to improve on what is best served simple and fresh!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing culinary experience I've had all year. I was so disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered a fried rice dish, a shrimp curry, and a cold noodle dish with beef. The first bite of the rice I thought \"gross\". First thing that came to mind...how do you mess up fried rice?? It's delicious! Something funky about the sauce, it ruined the whole dish. The shrimp curry had the best flavor yet the vegetables that came on the side were steamed peas and carrots. What the heck? It seemed the meal was cheapened by the vegetable choice. With a an average $20 meal I feel that \"Asian fusion\" should be able to prove some real veggies ie: broccoli, beans, cabbage, bockchoy..something! The flavors in the noodle dish was fine, however it was a bowl filled with Lettuce underneath the noodles and small portion of meat, so for that I was unimpressed as well. They used the Lettuce to make the meal seem bigger than it actually was. Save your money, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was a great place a year ago. Revisited recently and may have just been an off day. The personal touch is gone and while it is was busy, I have been here many times in the past and always was I made to feel that my business was appreciated."}
{"text":"Horrible! Spent 45 minutes waiting for a table then spent another 1 waiting for our food. Had a table of 5 with 2 bowls of Pho and regular entrees for the rest. In order for us to get our food we had to ask the waiters and waitresses why it's taking so long at least 3 times, and each time we asked they came back with \"let me check on it.\" Anyways, it was towards closing of the restaurant that we had received our dishes after everyone had left. Even then when new people kept coming in, they had received their food first instead of us. So before we left we attempted to chat with a manager about the lack of service and was given a bus boy to come to us instead. We explained the issue and they did nothing to resolve it on their own. The actual manager and owner saw us multiple times and did nothing to assist. Worst Vietnamese restaurant ever. Da Vang is better than this place.   Now for the food, the bowls of Pho were small and the broth was plain chicken broth. The entrees were not only cold they were in small portions as well. For the amount of food you get here the price is definitely not worth it.   J out."}
{"text":"We come down here every May to stay with our kids and look forward to eating at Saigon kitchen,  I order shaken beef. I have ordered steak all over this country and this is truly the best fillet and sauce for the money in this world. The owner Dennis is a master of sauces. Thanks Denny for always treating us so good and our kids the Bailey's."}
{"text":"First time ever being in this part of Phoenix and I had the craving for some authentic Vietnamese food. With the help of yelp I narrow it down to Saigon Kitchen.  As we arrived at the restaurant, parking was abundant. We were surprise to see that this place had outdoor seating and a full bar. We have never been to a pho restaurant let alone a Vietnamese restaurant with full bar in the center of the restaurant. The place was nice and roomy with plenty of seating.  For appetizers we tried the spring rolls and chicken wings, both were awesome choices for starters. For our entrees, I had the large pho dac biet while my wife had the Saigon Noodles. Both were very tasty .  I would caution that this isn't the typical Vietnamese pho shop like the ones most are used to in San Diego. The prices are not typical of most pho shops bc the quality, presentation and service speaks for itself. We never mind paying more for our food bc eating is what we live.  Can't wait to be back in the Surprise/Phoenix area, there are plenty of plates to try next time."}
{"text":"Seated a little too close for comfort next to talkative party of four while wishing I could carry on a conversation with my hubby on date night. Atmosphere is nice but very casual, on the same level as Pei Wei. Service was friendly and attentive. Enjoyed a fancy drink. Vegetarian spring rolls were very good. I had the pork fried rice and loved the sauce it was served with on the side (you mix in) so much I asked for more. I'd like to come back and try some other dishes such as the Bahn Mi."}
{"text":"Ive only been here for the pho soup which is fantastic!  Order the full as they know how to prepare the meats properly"}
{"text":"This place is great! Authentic banh mi, pho, and all other Vietnamese specialties! They have a few generic Chinese dishes but if you want a winner stick with the Vietnamese!   Bbq pork in or on anything its amazing, on the banh mi, or in rice best i have ever had. Great bread on the sandwich, crusty outside, super soft & fresh inside.   Every ingredient used looked and tasted amazing and could not be more fresh!  Already planning what i want on my next visit! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"The service is slow and non attentive. If you can get over that the food is delicious. We had the chicken pho, very flavorful and great portions. The marinated pork spring rolls were fresh and served with a delicious peanut sauce. The bun(rice noodles with other delicious items) was great. The pork was some of the best pork I have ever tasted. The fried egg rolls had a great crispy outside and delicious fresh inside."}
{"text":"Now I am going to hope the Vietnamese Ribs are on the menu every time, they are sooooooooooooooooo delicious!  I have also been HOOKED on the house chicken wings, I call them fish -chicken, which I know doesn't sound appealing, but OHHHH it is!! They are out of this world!"}
{"text":"A modern, clean restaurant located in a strip plaza along Bell road in surprise. We had the egg roll appetizer. It was served piping hot with a light oil dipping sauce. They were very tasty. For the entree I had the Saigon fried rice. A very large portion with good flavor but I thought the shrimp was a little overdone. My wife had the firecracker shrimp served over garlic noodles. Very good flavor, generous portion, and the shrimp was lightly breaded and fried.    Service was good. All the staff was friendly and attentive. Drinks were refilled without having to ask. Food was served hot.    Overall, a positive experience. I would recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been loyal patrons to Saigon Kitchen for some time now. Each time we go back, it gets better and better. There has not been a single dish we've tried that has been anything less than extraordinary. Like another reviewer here, I literally have to force myself to try something new because I like each dish that much, but each time I do I find a brand new favorite. My boyfriend is partial to the Dennis sandwich - a perfect blend of slightly spicy with fresh cilantro - and my favorite is the chicken pho. But recently, we tried the pork tenderloin special atop garlic noodles and it was outta-this-world delicious!   Moreover, the staff here is truly spectacular. Personable, attentive, and full of great recommendations on what to try if you just can't decide. We've come multiple times during a lunch or dinner rush and they always seem to handle the hungry masses with ease.    If you've been debating on going here for the first time, do yourself a big favor and try it! You really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant continues to make us happy!  The additional space is lovely and the food is great!  The service was attentive without being overly fussy.  Great experience.  Look at \"Check Please\" for their reviews!"}
{"text":"Love Saigon. We have been coming here since they first opened. They have grown a lot and the food is still amazing from when we first tried it. The shake in beef is a must try :)"}
{"text":"The beef pho is really good and the shrimp/pork spring rolls is pretty good also."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place what seems like forever now and I decided it was time to try it out...I sat down and I noticed the menu was a little short and didn't really know what to pick. The waitress was super friendly but that all did not matter to my 5 year old who wanted to color and was told they had no colors for her...besides that point I decided I was going to pick the shaken beef and my husband chose the pho. The food arrived, it was nothing short of amazing. My husband has yet to find good Pho since he left Portland, OR this place finally gave him the Pho he was looking for. The shaken beef hmm where to start, the sauce, it is truly scrumptious, I took one bite two bites three bites and could not stop until it was gone! The prices are well a little pricey unless you come at lunch they have some specials unfortunately at the time shaken beef was not one. The food, service and atmosphere awards this place a 5 star. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent on all levels. Small, casual, great-friendly service, and the food was super fantastic!!! Crispy Salmon, Filet Mignon on a sizzling platter, Shrimp Fried Rice, Surprise Shrimp are all have great flavor and very fresh. Prices are reasonable and a good value."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant.  I hadnt been there in about 2 years.  I went there yesterday and was GREATLY disappointed with the service, the portion sizes, and the quality of the food.  I didn't feel the family oriented atmosphere that I once felt... and I was nickel and dimed for extra bean sprouts and lime and basil for my pho which at one point the portion originally came with what I was now being charged $2 extra for.  The server just kind of shrugged her shoulders when I asked what had happened and why with no real answer.  My pho wasn't hot enough at all.  I feel like the restaurant traded up quality of food and service for a bigger and fancier place..   I was disappointed enough to never go back there again."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! The food is always done to perfection. Dennis is a great business owner who likes to make sure his customers are always happy. I recommend this place to anyone in the mood for some amazing food and a great atmosphere, Every dish that I have ever tried has been to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, Josh was extremely attentive and helpful.   The pork patty is amazing, quite possibly the best pork I've every had."}
{"text":"My new favorite for the summer heat! As always I am treated like a VIP and this was the new recommendation for me. Ahi tuna salad"}
{"text":"Great food awesome service...we will be back! Shaken beef is to die for and they have great iced tea. We came for an early dinner on the Friday before Valentine's Day and they only had room outside. What a treat, beautiful outside area and comfortable surroundings."}
{"text":"We originally were going to go to Pei Wei but they had closed because their hot water wasn't working.  We went here as an alternative & am so glad we did.  It was amazing.  We had the Asian wings for an appetizer. Great!  I ordered the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef that came with egg drop soup and salad.  My husband ordered the Surf and turf fried rice.  It came with egg drop soup. Everything was cooked to perfection.  My meat was so tender. We ate on the patio and the service was good. Everything was exactly as it should be. The only down side is it is rather expensive. Comparable to PF Chang's in price and that wasn't what our budget was originally. However, I'd highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and the best PHO in town. Everytime we come here were treated like family. It's a beautiful resturant and bar , family owned and  very clean."}
{"text":"I come here a lot but lately I realized that that prize of there food is too expensive .the owner needs to lower the prices of the entrees. Pho soup is not that good, it's smaller and more expensive compare to PT noodles Vietnamese restaurant located at Litchfield. If you want us to come more often lower the prices thank you"}
{"text":"Tried Saigon kitchen for the first time tonight.  Had the shaken beef which they have gotten great reviews for. The flavored were good and I liked it but it was a bit too salty. Drank a ton of water to make up for the salt. ThE garlic soup and dessert was yummy. We also had the combination rice plate which was very good."}
{"text":"My first time there.   It was busy but the team their was attentive.  The good was good and quick.   Was good to see more traditional food verses fried."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal!  We tried the lemongrass wings as an appetizer. (Yum) then we had the charbroiled pork. (Yum!)  However the lycheejito was the bomb! Lychee infused vodka with tonic, lime and mint. Our server (Lindsey) was friendly, helpful and quick! Overall a very good meal!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food and service is always really good. My favorite is the garlic noodles w beef and the lemongrass edamames."}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant but I ordered summer rolls take-out for first time and disliked the peanut sauce which is what makes these so yummy. Not peanutty enough with an of bitter after taste."}
{"text":"5++ stars. I can't say enough positive things about this restaurant. From the food, to the service, décor and beverage selections.... this is an A+ restaurant!  My husband and I both love the pho, there are many different variations for your protein (shrimp, filet, tofu and meatball, and more)...but the base of the broth is what makes it so delicious. We are also huge fans of their other menu items: shaken beef with Garlic noodles is a must try, as well as the Rice Vermicelli options if you want to have something a little lighter. We have tried most things on the menu and each item has been excellent.   The area is a bit small, so plan on a slight wait during busy times, but it is well worth the time spent!   Service is attentive and pleasant, and the owners presence is a refreshing reminder of the quality of service and passion for delicious food!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! Great service. Freshest food in the west valley! The pho is quite possibly the best I have ever had! Try the spring rolls. You won't be sorry. Go there....now!"}
{"text":"This was the most awkward and uncomfortable place I have ever eaten in. Our waiter took forever to help us, but after I finally got helped I saw another couple awkwardly looking around for their waiter so they can order, they didn't even get their drinks yet. My waiter barely spoke above a whisper, he stood right in front of my table and I didn't know he was there until I heard a faint \"hey there how you doing today\"...... Next, while I'm eating, I see a couple walk in and look around for the hostess but of course she's not at her post, she's hanging out with the bus boys by the silverware that aren't even being folded. It's not even busy and the people who work here don't seem to have a clue wtf is going on. No one has any personality or sense of urgency. I wouldn't think to come here during a dinner rush bc they can barely handle the slow hours. Good food tho"}
{"text":"From the very first the service and attention to detail was great  The bar was ever so friendly and fine to sit until our table was ready Once we ordered the food come out fast hot and so tasty  The spring rolls are a must. Next the beef soup is outstanding and so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"So this was my second time at Vietnamese food and I'm still a huge fan! The service here was super friendly and helpful. As I am a novice with this cuisine, I asked lots of questions and the server was happy to oblige with recommendations. I had doubts against jalapenos on the Bahn Mi sandwich and tendons in the Pho. They can omit them with no problem! I don't like super sweet. Avoid the lemongrass chicken! What is that delicious smell from the next table's meal? It's the Shaken Beef with onions! We started with the crispy egg roll (wrap it with the lettuce and mint provided, trust me) and it was out of this world. Cheap too at 4 for $5 or $3 during Happy Hour. We got the Pho with meatballs. The Pho was awesome, almost as good as what I had in San Francisco, but the meatballs were hard and kind of rubbery. I have learned that this is the way they are meant to be, it's a texture that Americans find difficult though. The flavor was good, but next time I'll try it with the steak or chicken. The firecracker shrimp were yummy (not as spicy as we were led to believe, but good) and the garlic noodles were sweet and buttery and delicious. Though they were too sweet for Hubby and other posters, I liked them. I guess it's subjective. The Bahn Mi was very tasty as well. The bread was top notch but the pate (we got the everything version) was a little much for me. I'll get the plain pork next time, but won't discourage other more adventurous people from getting the works. All in all, it was wonderful and we will definitely be going back again, only with the kids."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong dish.  I had pork 2 ways and a few grilled shrimp over rice.  This came with a small bowl of blah chicken broth and a nondescript  salad.  Shrimp was fine as were the two small pieces of BBQ pork, though way too salty.   The pork chop was horrible...tough as shoe leather and also way too salty.  The waitress was very pleasant, and perky, though way too loud.   The bus boy who cleared the table couldn't care less that  the  pork chop wasn't fit to eat.   $23.00 down the drain."}
{"text":"Excellent food - highly recommended. Nice staff and comfortable seating and decor make this restaurant a can't miss if you are looking for something other than typical burgers, fries, and tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty place took a friend for lunch. Restaurant has no lunch menu but extensive choices to pick from.  Staff was warm and attentive.  Two dishes ordered chicken curry and clay pot salmon.  Both came with a little salad and a broth soup. We enjoyed our meals. I feel a bit pricey for lunch, with tip almost $40.00."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here for pho when we are in the area and its well worth the trip. The pho is always delicious and boith is so flavorful! We have never got any other entree other than pho, but tempted after seeing the pictures on yelp. For drinks, try the coconut drink or lemon soda, both very good! Be careful, it's not free refills, but I usually drink about two. For appetizers, the shrimp eggs rolls and spring rolls are very good choices."}
{"text":"Here with two non-foodies, my parents. THey settled for Americanized food while I asked for the most authentic items they had. While I can't speak to the authenticity, the flavors were delicious. There were no leftovers, even for my parents. That means two things. Not too much food served and the flavors made us finish. In fact, I really, really cleaned my plate. I would go back."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and the service and food was fantastic! Had the Pho Ga which was reasonably priced and incredibly delicious. Some of the best food in Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"The place looked closed but I parked and went in anyway.....first mistake. No one else there....warning!   Nothing looked good to me so I ordered eggrolls to go. About the size of my finger, and no filling. BUT they were extra well done....yuk."}
{"text":"Saigon kitchen is one of the few restaurants that I would never return to, if I could rate it a no star I would. The owner was the rudest person ever!!! Their restaurant was completely dead, and they have a B for their sanitation grade. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"The food was great service was not too bad. However only thing that shocked me was the prices. For a moment I though I was in Scottsdale. Everything is a lot higher then normal pho place the portion was kinda small as well."}
{"text":"Love this place for their shrimp and garlic noodles. And their spring rolls are top notch. The peanut sauce you dip them in is killer."}
{"text":"I love Saigon Kitchen. For a while, we were heading there every weekend. It had just gotten too crazy though with all the snowbirds. I hate driving down Bell rd this time of year. So we havent gone in a while and having been ordering take out from Pholicious.  But that does not mean it isn't good. Its is great. I love the atmosphere. It is more upscale and classy compared to most Vietnamese places. It also has an interesting menu with so many things I want to try. I just can't not order Pho though. It is so tasty and healthy. I feel like a better person when I order pho. The pho here is great. It comes out fresh and hot, tons of veggies. My husband gets the pho thair and he loves it.  He actually prefers this place over pho tahn because it is classier. I like the pho better at the other place, but will go to either one. They are both about the same distance from my house. Plus this one has beer and drinks.  The service is always excellent. The staff is very friendly and loves our baby. They always make sure she is comfortable there. My only complaint is that they charge a lot for the small side of rice we give her.   It is fun going to Surprise and seeing all the snow birds trying this place. At first they are a little nervous, and get the simple things on the menu that are familiar. Then I see them looking at my soup. They always ask us what it is and say they are going to order it next time, and they are so happy they decided to try this place even though it was \"different\" and \"not their usual\". So go on Surprise snowbirds, try Saigon Kitchen, don't be scared, its fresh healthy and delicious. Try the pho!"}
{"text":"Came here for quick lunch. Beautiful decor but the food was lack of flavor. The waitress was nice, but I wish they have better food, so sorry to give you 2 stars.  I ordered shrimp fried rice and it came with broth soup. The fried rice was average and the broth soup was sweet, I didn't eat it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in surprise! Service is always wonderful, everyone is kind. The garlic noodles are a must have, firecracker shrimp is awesome, shaken beef is delicious! All the appetizers are super good! No complaints with this place!"}
{"text":"We had a party of six and arrived at 5:30. Good thing we had reservations because the place was happening. Our server Josh was great..we had our drinks, appetizers and our entrees. Everything came out hot and flavorful. ..the surf and turf with filet mignon beef was outstanding. Next time we'll probably sit at the bar for dinner. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My feelings on this restaurant are a little split...so let's just get into it.   Being in Surprise I understand that prices are going to be on the higher side. So, that is a downfall.   The food was good, just good. Not fantastic or anything I would be craving for. I ordered the small bowl of pho dac biet which was okay but lacking the real depth of the beef flavor. Hubby order the firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles (which I do recommend)   I noticed that there wasn't traditional Vietnamese fare such as banh xeo, soybean milk, and the rice plates did not offered shredded pork or meatloaf.   All in all, food was good. If you're looking to try some ethnic food that is a little easier on the western palate this is the place to try. However,  if you want traditional \"straight out of mama's kitchen\" type food I would definitely make the drive the 17th Ave and Camelback to Pho Thanh."}
{"text":"Great, if it weren't so damn expensive for Vietnamese food.  9 dollars for a bowl of pho is nerve racking for someone that's used to 5 dollars a bowl.  I will say this though, the food is excellent and the presentation is unlike any other vietnamese restaurant I have encountered.  A nice hotspot for the general public, and with it's monopoly over West Phoenix, it's a sorely needed treat and that 9 dollar bowl of noodles doesn't seem that expensive anymore."}
{"text":"This place is the most outstanding restaurant in surprise! The owner Dennis has done it right on so many levels! The food is so delicious and it never ever disappoints! Bring your whole family here!! You have to ask for Kathy or Steven to be your order! They're the OG's and know how to give you a great dining experience."}
{"text":"A good little Vietnamese restaurant.  Young servers in a hip atmosphere.  Good music looming in the air.  I'll be back.  They need to serve brown rice and to upgrade their pepper tray."}
{"text":"We really like this restaurant. Husband and I went there for our anniversary. The food is quite good. Our biggest complaint is the service, though the staff is attentive the courses come too closely together. We didn't have time to eat one course before the next course came. We've had this issue in previous visits as well. We would like to have time to eat the appetizer before the salad comes. We just ask the the staff wait a beat before bringing out the next course."}
{"text":"Wow, this is good stuff. First off, I entered to pick up my carry-out order, and I was greeted with a handshake and friendly faces. My food was ready, I was promptly served and I was on my way out within 3 minutes of walking through the door. My usual order in the valley is rice vermicelli with pork (Bun Thit Nuong) but I was pleased to see that Saigon Kitchen offers charbroiled chicken as well. This is a HUGE plus for me, as many other locations only offer shrimp, pork or egg rolls. The chicken was very good. The flavors weren't quite as marinated as I'd hoped and it was a touch on the greasy side (because it /is/ dark meat), but the flavor and texture were overall very good. The portion size is appripriate; I had enough to fill me.... and I generally eat a lot. I would've preferred more peanuts and pickled carrots on top, but that's nitpicking. Their fish sauce is one of the best I've tasted. I have to try their spring rolls and other standard Vietnamese items another time, but if you want a very good meal, the Bun Ga Nuong is an excellent selection."}
{"text":"Had Shaken Beef for lunch, delicious! The server was great and explained to me how to eat the dish. I had no idea Vietnamese food was so good. A little pricy for lunch, but it was good.   I was a bit concerned about one of the staff members drinking on the job when I watched him mix a cocktail behind the bar and then proceed to share a taste with my server. Guess when the owner is out there's no one really in charge in front of the house.  My first impression was \"what is that smell?\" Not sure if it was dirty water or rags used on the tables or the food/sauces being cooked in the back. I couldn't smell it after being in the place for a while.   The owner came in, personable guy and the staff shaped up. Overall not a bad experience and I would come back, with friends to dine with."}
{"text":"This is a fast food Asian restaurant with a lot of sugar and oil to satisfy fat midwestern  appetites.   Way too much of both for the sophisticated palette.  If this place were cheap, no foul.  But it's not.  Everyone has an opinion; this is mine."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Very nice and classy spot with excellent food. Favorites: fillet mignon pho, shaken beef filet mignon, and shrimp spring rolls. Had the chocolate lava cake with ice cream today for the first time today. DELISH!"}
{"text":"Surprise may be a bit of a drive from Phoenix or Scottsdale, but if you are in the West Valley and craving Asian food, Saigon Kitchen is the place to go.  A clean, modern and somewhat trendy look/feel, with an open bar in the middle of the restaurant.  Amazing appetizers, entres and service.  Order the Stir Fry and you won't regret it.  This hidden gem will be my new go-to."}
{"text":"I don't usually give a five star review but this is the best of the best in our growing town of Surprise.  I have eaten there twice now and I can't wait to go back. First time we ate at the bar and it was very busy so we had to wait longer than usual for our food.  I had the cornish game hen and it was falling off the bone delicious. Service is good & I like the modern decor of the restaurant.  Next visit I invited four friends to join us for dinner and much to my surprise everyone was happy.  It is hard to please everyone!  I had the garlic noodles and they were divine.  We need more restaurants like this in Surprise.  Next I'm going to try the Shaken Beef."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the West Valley. It is beautiful and upscale. The food is truly excellent. For instance, I order the fillet mignon and onion entree and although it is expensive, it is really a sliced fillet and done just the way you want it. Extremely tender too. I also love the spring rolls. Lots of variety. Try them all. The peanut sauce is great. Last month I brought 12 neighbors.  They all loved it. Service is great. Don't miss this place. Best Asian food in town and maybe the whole Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Wow, the Shaken Beef dinner was amazing. Really out of this world good. Make sure to get there during happy hour and get good prices on appetizers and drinks. The Spring Rolls were exceptional."}
{"text":"The food is delicious for dine-in, but if you are in a rush, this is not the place to order take-out.  I have a half an hour lunch, so I ordered well ahead of time and noted that time I would be there to pick up the food.  The food was ready on time, but it took them 20 minutes to make change.  I am not kidding!  By the time I got back to work, I didn't have time to eat.    The employees weren't allowed to open the cash register, so they made change using the money they had in their pockets and coins in a cup.  They had to fish through the cup to get out the correct change.  The waiter who was taking my money didn't have the correct change in his pocket, so he had to go get another employee to help him!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight. The filet Mignon entree was amazing. Service was fast. Enjoyable and affordable."}
{"text":"Really excellent AUTHENTIC Vietnamese run by a super friendly family.  The food was so fresh and pure I felt I was eating in their living room and not a restaurant, which is about the highest compliment I can give. Obviously, this place has caught on as it was Thursday dinner and people just kept coming in and coming in at this small, well decorated restaurant.  Seems they have tons of regulars eating there, too, after speaking with several people and seeing how many were greeted so warmly by the waiters. The food is fresh, authentic and delicious.  I had the shaken steak dinner and ordered calimari and spring roll appetizers.  Needless to say, this was just way too much food, and I ended up bringing some home.   My friend ordered fried rice with shrimp, and it was the best fried rice I have ever tasted.  Loved it! This is one of the best places I have ever eaten at on the West side, and definitely worth the trip.  The food is great, service is great, place is clean and cute...what's not to love?  My friend and I both said we want to return here...and soon."}
{"text":"OK, gave in to my desire to have great food again, Saigon Kitchen, Called for Reservations for Six at Six. got there the place was busy and my table was ready, tried food off the NEW Menu and it was just as Awesome as ever. the Rack of Lamb was raved over, Shrimp was really great as well as the noodles, Shaken Beef and Seafood Platter. The Service was excellent and as I could see all table were well attended. I may have been a little harsh on my first review on 2/6/16 but was a little upset. It is great to have a superior place to enjoy on this side of the Phoenix! Great Job Dennis! I believe you have the place under control.  Everyone enjoyed the meal ( As well as the dessert)"}
{"text":"We've been coming here a while now. What used to be one of Surprise's best kept dining secret is no longer much of a secret.  Why? Because, like many diners, every item I've had from the menu becomes a favorite dish. I literally have to force myself to try something different each time. Eventually I reckon I'll make it all the way through the menu.  Here's the hard part. Chef and owner Denis always puts some new amazing dish on the menu. Tonight's dish was rack of pork tenderloin with garlic noodles ($20). The pork was perfectly prepared and quite delicious. Hopefully it will make it onto the menu permanently.  More good news is the long awaited expansion is complete. The seating inside and out is easily doubled as is the bar.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"If you ever had authentic Vietnamese food, you'd know how bad this place is. Over priced, food not authentic. Poor service."}
{"text":"Pho was very good. Had the vegetarian version with tofu, mushrooms and bok choy. Also ordered sandwich with pate and other meats and it was good. Good happy hour and surprisingly beautiful decor."}
{"text":"This place is great for a light meal or big dinner. Me and my fiancé eat here often and today the owner introduced us to his new dish, the lamb and garlic noodles which was perfect. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat at in Surprise! My husband and I go here almost weekly for their Pho! Their chicken Pho is soooo delicious! Another great thing to try there is the shrimp spring rolls. The peanut sauce really compliments it! We love this place because 1. the delicious Pho 2. The cleanliness 3.the contemporary, nice interior. I also appreciate that the owner is always present and actually knows what is going on in his restaurant. He seems to know a lot of his customers as I often see him interacting with them. Im not surprised that he has a lot of regulars because I have become one. I'm basically in love with this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat.  Dennis the owner has turned this place into the best restaurant in the West Valley.  I love the flavors of all their food.  When new people are asking me what to get I said close your eyes and point with your finger.  It is all great no matter what you get.  They have some really nice holiday meals going on at the moment with Steak and Lobster, Grouper, and several other combinations.  They have a really nice happy hour as well with discounts on Apps and drinks.  All the servers treat me, well, better than my family treats me.  Always a happy place for me to go and get a great meal.  Come on over and you will find me with a smile sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Excellent, Shaken beef, beef stew, Cornish hen, garlic noodles, crispy egg rolls and garlic butter edamame all rock!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Surprise doesn't anything authentic......boy did we need this! Traditional and yummy!! Service is great and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting!"}
{"text":"Incredible food! If I still lived near Surprise I would probably be there right now, eating delicious pho, spring rolls, and calamari.   The owner and all of the people who work there are SO friendly and fun to be around. Sometimes I'd plan to get food to go, but when I got there and got talking with them all I found that I didnt want to leave.   Definitely a place to dine in, get to know everyone, and enjoy the best vietnamese food in all of the Phoenix Area!"}
{"text":"Still the BEST restaurant in Surprise!!!  Had the 86 Banana for dessert tonight   LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite restaurant in town. We've also had friends jump on the Saigon Kitchen bandwagon as well. Tonight was our second dinner here this week alone. Our service was fabulous. The food was fantastic.  We love the pho (both the steak and the chicken), the spring rolls, the crispy egg rolls, both the lemongrass beef and chicken, the garlic noodles, and the salmon. We can't wait to go back and try something else next time.  I'm sure our list of favorites will only grow.  One benefit to being in a town like Surprise is that a lot of chains don't see us as a good market (thank goodness) which is perfect for these wonderful independents to come in.  Saigon Kitchen is a gem and a welcome addition to our community!  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Saigon Kitchen has the best Asian food in Indian Trail! Try the Pho Beef. I was in Chicago's Chinatown recently and the food at Saigon rivals  the food I had there.  The business is locally and family-owned."}
{"text":"After pulling in front of the shop. I'll admit, we were hesitant to turn around and go to our usual pho joint BUT we gave it a try. Looks can be deceiving so don't be quick to judge this tiny gem.   This restaurant appears to be a mom and pop shop. With that being said, don't expect anything too grand when it comes to the pho. It's simple yet, I admire it. I like simplicity. It reminds me of something my mom or myself would throw together when making a quick pho. There are only two options, chicken pho or beef with meatball pho. Go with the beef and meatball. To me, it's a lot better than other places I've tried.  Spring rolls were the usual. It's the usual good. Their strawberry boba taste more of a strawberry smoothie but I'm not complaining. It taste as if fresh strawberries were used instead of the typical flavored powders. They only offer strawberry, green tea, or taro. There may be one other flavor but I cannot recall at the moment.   This place would be perfect for a quick bite of pho. Or for anyone passing through and are hungry. Also, CPCC students or teachers may find this place as a good choice to grab lunch or dinner as its nearby the Levine campus.   I would personally revisit. The staff were kind and sweet."}
{"text":"Best Asian food place to eat in Surprise!  The garlic noodles are a must. The shaken beef is always ordered by either my wife or myself."}
{"text":"Tried SK for the first time last weekend.  We had just returned from San Francisco so our culinary expectations might have been skewed... My husband had Com Dac Biet and I had Bun Ga Nuong.  Both were good.  Not exceptional or outstanding, but good, filling.  I thought my vermicelli was slightly too cold upon being served, it kinda stuck together, but once I gave it a stir in the fish sauce, which was very good, and got them to loosen up, they were pretty tasty.  Both dishes were very light on flavor and really lacked any spice, heat, or tickle to the tongue... I think this is known as bland... Yet not completely bland, I'd say blandish...  We had Cha Glo Tom as a starter and this was the highlight of our meal!  Because these were so darn good we had very high expectations  for our main dishes and were disappointed... Like I said, blandish... Especially in comparison to the starter and the culinary whirlwind we experienced in SF... But hey, it's a Phoenix suburb in a disgusting economy, so yes, we will dine at Saigon Kitchen again because it's as close as we can get...  I look forward to trying the Pho..."}
{"text":"Very happy!  Food is homemade and top notch.  Even potato chips are homemade.  We wanted a light lunch so we split one sandwich between 2 people and it was enough.  Then the 6 of us chose 6 pastries/desserts and sampled all    around.    My favorite was the key lime tart.  The sandwiches are around $8, and total cost of  pastries was under $15 (buy five get one free!).  We paid a total of about $50, same as eating hamburgers, waaay better food!!  I think it is ridiculous that someone gave 2 stars for the birthday cake.  If it looks beautiful when you pick it up and it tastes delicious you shouldn't blame the establishment for not getting it home intact."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar, food was exceptional! Sat next to the owner who gave us recommendations and we took him up on them. I had the filet mignon pho and it was so,so good! My husband had Saigon fried rice and I think it was even better than what I had.  We loved this place the moment we walked in. It's decorated very nicely and super clean. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We have been dining here since they opened.  Last night we decided to try two new appetizers that Dennis told us about.....they were excellent!  We had the salt and pepper shrimp which was very flavorful and the sweet and sour wings which were a different way of serving wings.  This new twist on wings won us over!  We will definitely order these two appetizers again. Jim and Cheryl"}
{"text":"The pho was really greasy and flavorless. We had the coconut bubble tea and it was very watered down. Overall, not a great experience. We won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Does anyone else feel like their reviews disappear sometimes on Yelp? It's so weird. I've been a few times to Saigon Kitchen once with just my husband and again with the entire family. It's a bit pricey so I prefer the two of us ha ha ha. Anyways if you are a big pho lover then I recommend the surf and turf pho. The portion is huge and they will tell you that, but it's great to take home. My only negative thing is that this time it was all surf...where was the turf? No meet at all. It took quite a while to get our food so I wasn't about to send it back. The appetizers did safe my life though. If you're looking for a date night this is a nice little place with great decor and dim lighting without having g to travel to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"So glad that I we came here for lunch. We tried spring rolls they were so refreshing and light. Perfect appetizer. Then on to my lunch....I tried shaken beef with garlic yakisoba type noodles. This was bomb. The beef was so tender and well seasoned a a sauce that makes my mouth water as I write this review.  My friend had the pork lunch special which came with a bowl of soup salad and rice. I give both these plates a thumbs up big time. Service was outstanding. I did notice they had alot of regulars. I do like to see this. There is inside and outside seating. The only thing that killed me was my plate was 16 dollars. I had to try what everyone was talking about on yelp. It was worth it to me. Sometimes it's ok to treat myself lol. What made this lunch nice was that I enjoyed it with good company. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ugh. That's about all I can say about this place. I was VERY excited when I saw that they were opening a Vietnamese restuarant in the Surprise area, I'd previously had to drive an additional 30 minutes to get my pho fix. Because there's a lot of cons to this place, I'm just going to break it down into a list:  Pros: -good location (Surprise) -ample parking -clean, modern restaurant -nice bar seating, TVs to watch sports -sells their own \"infused\" liquors, which I haven't tried  Cons: -pho is disappointing. The rare beef soup was oddly flavored (like something out of a box) and the beef was stringy and not tender at all.  -STAY AWAY FROM THE SPRING ROLLS. They are the WORST I've ever had. The pork was dry (like, crunchy dry) and the shrimp was not chilled, but room temperature. The rolls had too much mint, were not well put together and warm. I literally was sick after eating these.   Given that I've been there on 3 separate occasions and have left twice without finishing my meal, I seriously doubt that I will be giving them another chance. I'm a serious fan of Vietnamese and other East Asian cuisine and this place, quite simply, does not cut it."}
{"text":"Unique place with really really good food. I like that it is a smaller setting and the people are friendly.  Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open so we could have a place in Surprise to eat other than the chain trash eateries. I had the egg rolls which were crispy and delicious. I also had the Pho which was hot and delicious. Service was good, prices reasonable. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food is fresh and enjoyable. I would like it cooked spicy instead of adding spices after it is cooked and served. The place is very clean. I was amazed there was not more customers. The staff is very friendly too. We really appreciated everything. Cathy was excellent. Sit in her section."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Surprise hands down.   Food is amazing, make sure you try the garlic noodles. Prices are high. Too high in my opinion, however I still find myself here a lot. Their Pho is some of the best ive had. The owner and staff is very friendly. This place gets packed. Expect a wait weekends at 6.  Its next to pei wei, which given the price different and quality difference really doesnt make them direct competition."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fusion cuisine. I find these places artificial. However, this is just my personal taste. If I have to judge the restaurant, I can say the food was very well prepared, the staff was very friendly and attentive, the owner came to talk to us to ask us about our trip. The only things I didn't like are the lack of chopsticks (but then again this is part of the fusion thing) and the salted caramel ice cream was not very tasty. My friend loved this restaurant, I was more like \"it's okay\", so we'll even it at 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Was recently visiting PHX, and stopped here for dinner.  Being a fan of Pho, I ordered the Pho Tai.  Believe me when I tell you that this was a ne of the best bowls I've ever had.  Pho is all about the broth, and Saigon's is terrific.    Was so impressed, that I returned the next day for lunch, when I enjoyed their braised pork Banh Mi.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Arizona. Clean and modern look. Food is fresh and tasty. My husband and I go there quite often and the the kids like the garlic noodles."}
{"text":"Our go to spot for Pho if we're trying to stay local. A bit pricey compared to others I've been to but the service makes up for it. Try the Vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"The sizzling beef and seafood, along with the garlic noodles and short ribs are AMAZING!!!  You won't be disappointed and should go right now!  Love visiting this place every time I'm in town. Great service, friendly staff and fantastic food."}
{"text":"This place is okay. We have have gone there many times. Almost every time we have been completely satisfied with our choices. This time I have to say that it wasn't their  best. Service good, noise level better. My wife's salmon was perfect. I myself tried the Viennese Ribs. Okay one more thing off the list. I guess I am use to good old American ribs. To me no flavor. Salads were sort of wimpy.  I think we'll take a break from going there. Maybe after the first of the year will try again."}
{"text":"Got the surf and turf pho that everyone was raving about. It was meh, ok. Not horrible, not amazing either. It was very basic and didn't have any favors that would separate it from every other place. Now the fried shrimp appetizer, that was good. I wouldn't come here for pho though. I'm gonna keep trying to find an amazing restaurant that makes it right!"}
{"text":"This place continues to impress me. I LOVE the Shaken Beef and their Combination Pho. I don't think I need to go to any other place when looking for Vietnamese food. The best part? It is here in the town of Surprise! Great service, great food and so glad to see that business is going so well that they could expand the restaurant! Congrats Saigon Kitchen! My wife and I and quite a number of our friends love you!"}
{"text":"Anyone that knows great Vietnamese food knows that Viet fare is affordable, with a kick of fish sauce and a background from Cambodia, Thailand, France and Laos. I went to order a traditional Bahn Mi...look, I am a not a cheap ass but NINE FREAKING DOLLARS for a sandwich made me laugh. Really? Should be $3.25. Just like they are everywhere else. I understand the monopoly and the game but come on....that is a disgrace and disrespectful by all means. Not even good, not worth it, not worth a second chance....bummer."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just don't feel like driving up to Le's to get a Banh Mi - maybe it is because I really don't want to get the car aligned for a sandwich, no matter how good that sandwich might be. Plus, some places are just closer. So we'll pop on over to Saigon Kitchen.  Even better is you can get a nice bowl of pho to go along with your sandwich, or if you are feeling like something else entirely, you can go off in that direction instead. Plenty of options on the menu, and the staff has always been very welcoming and will help you choose a dish that fits your mood.  Not much to look at from the outside, but well worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Great food.  We were there on a Saturday evening and it was very busy. However, we were able to get a table four 4 adults and 2 children.  Ordered the chicken wings with the house sauce, outstanding for the appetizer.  Just enough to take off the hunger edge.  My daughter in low ordered the Lemongrass chicken, she said it was very good.m Son ordered the shrimp dinner with rice and pho soup and salad, hubby had the BBQ Pork, shrimp and sausage fried rich, outstanding he said!  Ii had the shrimp stir fry, also outstanding.  We enjoyed it so much and would order the same except we all want to try a different entree when we come back.  Suggest the Lemon Soda as a drink, our grandson had it and it was very tasty.  It was made from scratch with real lemons.  Great place to go in the Northwest Phoenix Valley."}
{"text":"Love this place, shaken beef is amazing,  garlic noodles with shrimp is very good as well, little on the pricy side but nice treat once in a while. Faith the manager is awesome. .."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in the valley! The service is always really great, and the food is amazing. Always fresh and flavorful. Love that we live so close, but would drive and distance for this place."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Best Filet Mignon I've ever had, the sauce is unbelievable.  Shrimp spring rolls were amazing.  The bartender and owner were super friendly, I noticed they knew around a half-dozen of their customers by name.  Casual atmosphere, full bar with flatscreens, nice decor."}
{"text":"Oh yes. Went here while visiting relatives in AZ. Amazing food, excellent service.   What I really liked is that in an indie restaurant like this you get people that really seem happy to be working there as opposed to corp-chain restaurants. They know what they are serving, and they know they are serving great food.  Started with the crispy egg rolls - these are the famous egg rolls that are delicious - wrap them in the lettuce & mint for a proper treat. Then had the Specialty pork ribs - key here is eat them while hot (made the mistake of talking instead of eating). Finished with the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef - which were, well yes, amazing.  Here's a hint - order the soup. The waiter kind of downplayed the soup as being very simple. Well, it may look simple, but the flavors just exploded in a great way. When we told the waiter how much we loved it, he explained the ingredients and process of making - and it all made sense."}
{"text":"Surprise!  A Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise.  I ordered bun noodles with beef/lemongrass to go.  I waited at the bar, and the service was great.  The owner sat next to me and had a plate of spring rolls.  I made a comment on how tasty they looked, and he asked if I wanted one.  I think that's when I knew I loved this place.  Anyhow, I got home and tasted my food.  Awesome.  The noodles were cooked perfectly (not soggy), and there were plenty of veggies and meat.  The nuoc mam had a lot of flavor as well. (You can have really good food, but if you have crappy nuoc mam, your food won't taste right.)  I think I'm gonna have to start ordering to-go weekly."}
{"text":"After the eating debacle last night I was ecstatic when we pulled up to the parking lot here. Tried to get in last night. Way too long a wait. Could have been because it was Sunday night. Didn't face that issue tonight.  Cozy and stylish, we entered the restaurant famished to a person. One of us diners is local and threw out what he likes to order best when eating here. Two of us took his suggestion and ordered the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef, as did he.  But first we had drinks. Beer for the guys. A lovely Ms. Margarita for me. Had a slight kick due to the jalapeño, but not overwhelming. The basil made it taste nice and light. Very refreshing. The signature dishes are served with soup as well as salad, and we also ordered two types of spring rolls - shrimp, and pork. The rolls were fresh, enhanced by the peanut sauce. Nice sauce, just the right amount of sweetness. My cohort is not a salad guy, but really enjoyed it with the dressing. His excuse was that it would allow him to order dessert. I like salad a lot and agreed with him. The soup was a Chicken Scallion Broth that left me wondering if that was the base for their pho. Hopefully I will get to find out before I leave Surprise.  Then our main courses arrived. The Filet Mignon Shaken Beef comes on a sizzling plate, served with Jasmine rice. Josh had asked how we wanted the steak cooked and it was perfection on a skillet, with lots of grilled onions abounding and around. I was getting full at this point, but also pretty happy because I don't have wheels here and was already anticipating the leftovers for tomorrow.  The dining companion who didn't have steak ordered another signature entree - Saigon Garlic Noodles. He stated that the pork was tender and the noodles were yummy. He also couldn't finish his meal as the two pork chops were huge.  Needless to say we could not swing dessert. All the more reason to return this week. Just to put it in perspective, I love food but not crazy about writing reviews. Had a ten hour work day and am looking forward to curling up for a long sleep after a shower tonight. But I had to write this! Two thumbs up and a few curled toes. Not to be missed when in Surprise.  Simple, clean eating grub."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we come out to Phx..Sun City West to visit because it past my wife's taste test....She is picky, born in Asia and her mom is the best cook in the neighborhood, she know her food. We load up everything and usually get some to go for the day after. Very busy but not to busy. The only draw back we found was lots of staff but we had to flag down a waitress for service....w/ so much staff I was surprised no one picked up on a waiting customer. Overall it was great food...hot and tasty and will always stop in when we are in town."}
{"text":"I was in today with my 77 year old mother who has zero experience with Vietnamese food and my knowledge is limited. Our server was helpful and gave great descriptions of the food, didn't just say, \"this is our most popular item.\" And, he was very well spoken in a world full of \"umm\" and \"like\", it was refreshing. A little grammar and enunciation goes a long way!     On top of the lovely service and respectfully decorated spotless interior, the food was AMAZING! Everything we ordered was delicious. Clay pot salmon was a tasty surprise. The Saigon garlic Noodle with beef was tender and the sweetness of the garlic noodle unexpected. The crispy egg roll with the mint and sweet vinegar sauce was excitedly different and thoroughly enjoyed.   We will return often. In the Bell Road sea off chain restaurants this is a gem."}
{"text":"We had a group of eight friends that went. Food was fabulous! Service was fabulous! We all had great food and a good time. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is by far the very best place to eat in the surprise area. We have been enjoying the special recipes that Dennis creates for years and are never disappointed.  The food is fabulous, the service excellent. Our favorite is the shaken beef and seafood bruschetta."}
{"text":"We Frequent here about every two weeks. They have a great Happy Hour. The Wait Staff is Nice and helpful. It's always very clean which I LOVE. I really like the Filet Mignon Salad, Rice Noodles (Vermicelli) with Chicken, All their spring rolls are delicious and I usually have a Ginger Fizz..as far as cocktails go it's my favorite.We also like their Pho but it's been to hot lately to enjoy it. Sunday's are great to visit this place as it's usually not busy between 3-5. We've been on a Friday night and it's just really busy and loud. But if that's something your ok with enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good selection of dishes on the menu. Service was great. Happy Hour has a nice selection of drinks and apps."}
{"text":"What an amazing place.  My wife and I shared some crispy egg rolls as our appetizer, for our main course she got the chicken fried rice and I got the shaken beef.  I can't believe how tender the beef was and the onions to black pepper ratio was amazing.  I noticed people expressed concern for the small amount of the chili sauce they give you; they now give you the whole bottle.  My wife liked it so much she said she wants to meet her father here later in the week."}
{"text":"Very nice décor and friendly staff, especially the owner who repeatedly came by the table to make sure all was well.  Vietnamese food was very well done. (Bun, and combination plate)  A bit pricey for the serving size ($14/each) Aug 2015 update     Food still good BUT no lunch menu so pricey for lunch"}
{"text":"Try the rice noodles with cured pork...delicious and light...my husband thinks they are a little slow on service (even for take out) but the food is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice, casual, yet classy joint. Everything is absolutely delicious. The chicken pho is my favorite! Pay the extra dollar for the large for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"The place was a lot fancier than I expected. I'm used to kind of run down Vietnamese places but this place is nice. The servers were friendly. One of them actually just had a casual conversation with me while i waited which was refreshing.  He requested that I get the Shaken Beef? So I did and it was really good. I got my food to go so I couldn't really experience the whole atmosphere of the place. I will definitely be back again to try something else. (The guy next to me got an order of pho that smelled heavenly...)"}
{"text":"Wow, yet another amazing restaurant, how come that does not \"Surprise\" me, coming from the \"Sister\" restaurant \"Rice Paper\". Dropped in last night to see what the buzz was about and ordered the Fillet & Jumbo Shrimp with fresh lemon grass which was made with perfection with a perfectly balanced dipping sauce served with a side of rice, a small bowl of the pho soup stock and a tasty side salad. Dennis and Hue brought out  a  Cornish Game hen that was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, these culinary marvels don't mess around!!! and of course it also came with a wonderful dipping sauce. Both dishes were superb not to mention the hospitality from Dennis the proprietor who tells me he only  uses the freshest ingredients and boy your palate sure notices the difference. The food quality exceeds the price of the menu, I would pay double for the quality given here. Saigon Kitchen you have a customer for life here, can't wait to bring my family in here. Looks like Saigon Kitchen and Rice Paper are my home away from home now!!!!"}
{"text":"Pork on shrimp crackers, fantastic, will come back just for those. Saigon shaken beef was great."}
{"text":"The problem with restaurants like this is when you have tried authentic Vietnamese food and there is a huge disparity in taste and quality. Sorry, but after trying their food twice, we will never come back again. It's a short drive to Pholicious or Old Glendale's Little Saigon, so we will just keep going to those two."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for Vietnamese food. They have the best chicken Pho and the crispy egg rolls are too die for! I personally like eating them with the lettuce wrapped around them. The only negative thing I have to say is I think it's a little spendy but will totally pay the price because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Everything has always been fantastic! Staff are friendly and attentive. Went last night and had the holiday special cherry chocolatini. Would order that again. Please keep it on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Surprise!! Always an excellent experience. The menu is extensive including Pho and many other traditional Vietnamese dishes. Service is great the waiting staff is wonderful the atmosphere is always welcoming. The Vietnamese coffee is a delightful treat."}
{"text":"We stopped in recently for a late evening dinner, on the recommendation of a colleague.  Thank you, Tim, we loved it!  The food was fresh and delicious, the staff were friendly and accommodating.  I left wishing I lived nearby and not 6 hours away in San Diego.  My final wrd on Saigon Kitchen is Yummmm.....!"}
{"text":"The server we had was very friendly and super helpful to me when I let him know I was vegetarian. He double checked that they had vegetarian broth available before he confirmed to me that they had what I could eat.  The vegetarian pho, which you have to specify you want vegetable broth because it will come with chicken or beef broth if you don't, was pretty good. It was a tiny bit more bland than I am used to, but with jalapeño and lime it was perfect.  I will definitely go back next time I want Pho!"}
{"text":"Fun little place with good noodle bowls.  Had some family in town and we hit this restaurant together.  Food is good and the staff is friendly.  They were all young and sometimes forgot to check on drinks and finished dishes, but they did circle back and were kind.  Broth for the Pho was rich and savory.  Garnishes were good, but could have been more flavorful.  Other noodle bowls were yummy.  One odd thing was two people ordered the same dish and one had a lot more egg roll in it than the other.    The Saigon Chicken Wings were a new an cool twist on a traditional appetizer.  Pot stickers were pretty good, as well.  Good value overall."}
{"text":"Had to wait 45 minutes to be seated for a group of 5, which is understanding, since it was a busy night. After being seated an getting our orders taken, it took them almost an hour for them to deliver our food to our table, by this time it was almost closing time. A couple of people ordered chicken pho, which takes only 15 minutes to cook. I and a couple others ordered simple meat dishes. I got the shrimp curry and they only give me 7 pieces of shrimp with a side of cold rice. Really!? If the owner can't cook rice or how to keep a dish warm why is he even in the kitchen? Leave it to the professionals. After we complained of our issues, they sent over a bus boy pretending to be a manager. However, he gave excuses and didn't act upon them. Really showed incompetence and lack of any type of managerial skills. I would not recommend this place, considering incompetent employees, unskilled owner, and lack of quality service."}
{"text":"Update review... Just went here on a busy Friday and became not a fan...  I did order my norm, combo plate.  Pork cube, pork chop, and shrimp.  Note I always ask to replace the shrimp with chicken.  I cannot eat shellfish and I assume chicken is less than shrimp.  To my surprise they wanted to up charge for the swap?  The waiter said he would have to talk to the manager to do the swap with no up charge.   I also noted the manager talking up charge to another customer that wanted to substitute the noodles for another type of noodle.   To top of the experience, another group of customers asked for a bus boy to clean their table.  After waiting for a good 10 minutes they left?   Maybe they were having a bad night of service?  Another issue I had was once I did get my main course I was not given a steak knife to cut the pork chop on the plate.  Once I did flag down someone, I was told that they had to grab a knife from the kitchen and had no steak knifes and the normal knifes cannot cut the pork chop? I have put Saigon kitchen on the bottom of places I would visit now that I have experienced poor service on this visit.  Not only me, but it was noted around me and it is not often I am at a restaurant and customers leave because of lack of attention.   Fix the customer service, up charge, and get some knifes to cut what you serve.  Wish the owners were there.  I always experience great customer service when they are present, I use to love this place."}
{"text":"The food is good. We come here for the pho because it's close by. The restaurant is small and there aren't many tables so I wouldn't go there hungry on a crowded day without reservations. Call to go orders in an hour before planning to pick it up. Waiting area to be seated is small and kind of awkward, I hope they get a bigger facility to accommodate for how popular they seem to be."}
{"text":"Tough- in between a 3 and a 4. Probably try something else first so put it at a 3.   Atmosphere is good. Service is good.   Price is a expensive.   Food is quite well cooked, delicious, a little bit too salty but I like it.   Garlic noodles with the shrimp ($2extra for veggies) and the egg rolls were excellent."}
{"text":"Service was great, location is prime and food was very good. I ordered a bowl of noodles with grilled shrimp and enjoyed it very much. I also had some veggie rolls and they were tasty. Server did a great job."}
{"text":"Came here to try their much talked about Pho but settled on something else.  Nonetheless, this place was Pho-nomenal!  Location & Aesthetics - located on Bell Road (corner of Bell and Litchfield) between Longhorn Steakhouse and Carrabba's. It might be easy to miss from Bell Road because what you see from Bell Road is the rear of some (not all) of the restaurants as their facades face south.  The sign to the restaurant is large enough from Bell Road so I'm thinking you won't miss it.  Even if you miss it while traveling west, it's not a problem and very easy to make a U-turn on Bell as there are enough U-turn options available on the road. Lots of parking in the rear, and the parking lot was well lit. The interior of the restaurant is well-lit if you're dining in the evening as we were, and I'm guessing if you're dining in for lunch too, you won't have a problem as the restaurant is surrounded with glass windows.  There is also the option to dine alfresco at the side of the restaurant. Normally I would minus a point here as the restaurant was on the small side and felt cramped however the owner - Dennis did come around and happened to introduce himself to us, asked how we knew of the place and picked it (told him Yelp of course!), as well as indulged in some small talk, and did mention that he was expanding the place by taking over the space next door which will be occurring mid-December to sometime in January, and even extended a personal invitation for us to attend the grand re-openinging. The place was also exceptionally clean.  The noise level was average as it was a Friday evening but wasn't overly loud that I couldn't hear anyone in my party. Despite the place being really busy for a Friday evening, I didn't notice anyone having to wait for seating.  Service/Menus - menus were provided to us as by our waitress soon as we were seated.  Very easy to read and understand.  Even our questions were answered promptly.  Our waitress took our drink orders immediately and gave us time to think about what we wanted to order.  Drinks came promptly and our waitress even saved us some money.  We came in a minute before happy hour was finished (3-6 PM).  Thankfully our waitress put in our drink and appetizer orders just in time so we ended up paying a little less (Happy Hour prices) for those items.  Food/Drinks - For libations, I ordered the orange martini which was delicious and not too tart.  For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp & pork spring rolls (2 and its cut in half so you end up having 4 bites) - lettuce, bean sprouts, rice vermicelli, and mint served with a peanut sauce dip - very tasty particularly the ingredients added to the rolls like the mint and bean sprouts which served to enhance the tastiness of the shrimp and pork.  The rice vermicelli also gave the rolls a particularly nice transparent appearance.   For the main course, I thought I was going to have the Pho but instead settled for the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef - which is seared cubed beef tenderloin marinated in their house special soy, and served on a sizzling skillet with onions.  When this part of the dish, came out, it was sizzling and I even had folks who were passing by asking me if I ever had this dish and commenting on how great it is, and it's the only thing they order when they're there.  By itself, the beef was tender, moist, juicy, and very flavorful.  The soy wasn't overpowering or too salty, and the onions were sautéed beautifully and not burnt at all.  They will ask you how you want the beef cooked, and for me it was medium, and it was done exactly like that!  It was also recommended by the wait staff to mix the lime and salt and pepper that comes with the dish first, then use that to dip the beef in (as an option) to enhance its flavor.  I tried it and they were correct in that it did seem to multiple the flavor(s) tenfold! This dish is also served with jasmine rice which was warm, fresh, sticky (as rice should be in my opinion) and very tasty; a side salad; and a scallion broth which was hot and just the right thing to clear those sinuses (though mine wasn't in need of clearing).  Well, my intentions were to come here to sample their Pho and despite that not happening, I don't have any regrets coming here at all.   As promised to the owner, I will return to try their Pho!"}
{"text":"This place has great food! The caramelized salmon is too live for! Also the sizzling filet mignon is excellent. We also enjoyed the crispy eggrolls. Great place, give it a try!"}
{"text":"The only good food we had all week. I was tired of the frozen stuff from my father in law's freezer & the stuff he got a deal on from Costco. I suppose where I was all week might have made this good taste especially good. But it was good. And the restaurant had an excellent vibe."}
{"text":"Just went last week and had a small bowl of pho and as always very delicious! I can't even finish the small side. It's big enough for two meals. Shredded chicken is always soft. Love this place! Best crunchy egg rolls!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. When it's date night, we know where we're going! Have dined several times and never had anything less than delish, but our favs are the shaken beef and the surf n turf pho."}
{"text":"The pho here was delicious!  We came with some friends who eat here regularly, and they did not disappoint. Starters were delicious too, and the tea was on point. Service was solid.  Zero complaints about stopping by this tasty place."}
{"text":"Resoundingly mediocre. Undercooked school lunch fries. They were supposedly flavored but the flavor seemed to have been misplaced on the way from the kitchen. I have had better flavored noodles from a top ramen box. Cocktail was syrupy sweet, wontons were greasy, shrimp was over cooked and tough. Nothing was completely inedible, but neither was it enjoyable.The Olive Garden of Asian food. Wait staff however was pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good spring rolls, Pho Beef Soup and the Lemon Grass Shrimp are to die for. Is a bit expensive but the atmosphere and the foods are definitely worth a try. Would give it a 5 for food, gave it a 4 because of price."}
{"text":"I suppose being on Check Please Arizona (PBS) raised expectations but I was disappointed.  On a positive note, our waitress was delightful however the food was so so. Fresh spring roll was tough, the chicken diced and the stir fry a but soggy.   I would go there again.    Every place can have an off day. We spent $60.00 for lunch - no alcohol.  Paula"}
{"text":"I was trying to find places for Chinese food in Indian trail, I came across this place because of the good reviews. Unfortunately they didn't make the meal that I requested and made something they said I will like. The meal was okay, I wouldn't get it again, and I had to wait an extra 10 minutes for the meal. I was under the impression they didn't even have it made until I arrived, 30 minutes after I ordered."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Surprise. The shaken beef is ridiculously good and the firecracker shrimp is a must. The pho is my comfort food, great to-go because they include all the condiments. The staff is great and since they expanded, there is rarely a wait. There isn't one thing about this place that I would change."}
{"text":"The place is small and a bit cramped. We chose to sit in the patio area which was quite nice, however, we were there for lunch and there were gardeners working only a few feet from us blowing dust everywhere! Not their fault the building owners scheduled gardening service at peak lunch hours I'm sure.  Aside from those minor complaints I loved the food and service was great! Our food was served in a timely manner, refills kept on coming, plates were cleared as needed and our waiter was very polite. He was also very knowledgeable about the menu and quick to answer any questions we had. Our portions were a good size and delicious! The spring rolls are on the appetizer list but were very filling by themselves. Overall it is a great place and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a good place for pho in the west valley and this was recommended. Ordered the filet mignon pho and the spring rolls and they were both great. One day decided to try something new and got the banh mi with everything on it. Damn good sandwich and worth the price. Great all around place."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a couple of other people. They both ordered a salmon dish - one ordered the Sizzling Salmon and the other a very similar salmon dish, without the onions. I ordered Chicken Lemongrass, because I was in the mood for lemongrass.   First the Salmon (non-sizzling) arrived. It was quite warm temperature wise - both the food and the dish itself. A couple of minutes later, the Sizzling Salmon arrived - it was SIZZLING hot - the dish was HOT, the food was HOT.   I'm thinking - my lemongrass chicken will be steaming hot. A couple of minutes later - I'm not exaggerating there were several minutes between delivery of each of the meals. The lemongrass chicken was barely warm - BARELY WARM. I'd waited long enough, it was a couple of hours after I usually ate and I didn't complain. Well, not until this review. Did they not notice that ONE plate was sent out considerably colder than the other two and minutes later?   I've had good food here before and good service. However, I was not happy at all with that meal. I wouldn't choose this restaurant again - at least not for quite a while.   The outdoor seating is nice - I did notice that as I ate my delayed, barely warm food. Grrr."}
{"text":"The food and now the ambience makes this the Best Restaurant in Surprise! Flavor and creativity of dishes are spot on"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 stars. I have gone to this place plenty of times and always got the pho. I had been begging my mom to come with me to try the pho and finally one day she agrees. Well turns out none of us out of 4 got the pho but I did order something new to me, the curry shrimp. When ordering the waiter asked if I wanted it spicy since it is not spicy at all I said a little would be ok. My food comes out so spicy it made my eyes water and nose run. My mom decided to try some and was angry that i was eating it and insisted I say something. I told the waiter and he offered to bring me some extra sauce with no spice to help balance it. It didnt help much so I asked for a bit more to go and i would attempt to eat it at home since everyone else was done eating. The manager then tells him I have to pay for the extra sauce. So he offers me to speak to the manager and I do. The manager explains this is how much chili flakes is added to a mild meal and basically people have different opinions on spice level, as if I am just being a baby and my food is not that spicy. He also keeps asking \"what do you want me to do there is nothing to do. I told the waiter extra sauce wont help\" and starts arguing with my entire table. He was beyond rude I was in shock I had never heard anyone at a place of business speak like this to customers before it was obvious he didnt care about our business at all. He never apologized and did not care at all. It was clear I just had to deal with my inedible food. He made it look like I wanted a free meal, but I just wanted an apology some compassion, something. So we eventually paid and left after all the arguing was done. It was embarrassing and rude I was so excited to take my mom there and that is what happens. I will not return. Oh and the next day my mouth was actually sore from how hot the food was and I did not even finish it."}
{"text":"I came here because of a previous review I was looking to saves some money.  At first glance the restaurant didn't look like much, as its in a strip mall like many Chinese restaurants have with a few tables in.  They do have a lunch menu that starts at $5.99. The menu looked like Chinese so I thought maybe this wasn't Vietnamese at all.  So I ordered Chicken with mixed vegetables.  The cokes (store bought 16 oz) variety are 2 bucks.  The food was really good. It did have a Vietnamese style and flavor to it so I was pleased.  I finished the plate right off. You get enough for one person so no left overs.    I would probably come here again, but might get a cup of water next time to save the extra $2.  My total bill was $8.16 which wasn't too bad. Recommend."}
{"text":"Ridiculously amazing food, very friendly staff, and great suggestion for beer! Family and I will definitely be back in the near future! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"So we loved this place by haven't been there In awhile specifically because they are high dollar and little portions. However once in awhile we just go forming cause there lemongrass chicken was the bomb. But that is not the case now. We went there tonight and the bowl they put the chicken in had half the portion size from before and was cooked not so good. Ended up having to send it back and get something else. Was not the quality it once was that deemed it worthy of its high dollar low portion status. Sorry. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very classy restaurant.  Nicely decorated.  Very pleasant attentive staff.  This review is based on a one time dining experience; just so you know.  The food was good but not as flavorful as I had expected. Bland would be too strong a word. But knock-your-socks-off favorable would be inaccurate also.    The food, in my opinion, is very overpriced for what you get.  I had 'shaken beef' which consisted of mostly rice and onions and not a lot of beef even though it is advertised at 8 ounces.  That was $18.  Wife had 'firecracker shrimp on garlic noodles' which was very good but at $17, not really a value for the money spent.  The 'spring rolls' are very good and at $3 each, could be a full meal for a small appetite.  Beer is overpriced at $5 a draft.    I might go back to try one of the Banh Mi sandwiches to see if I get a little more value for my dollar.   Four stars for the classy, nicely decorated, friendly staff.  Three stars for the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is gone from great in the beginning to very spotty in the new and expanded facility.     My wife and I were there on Sunday and found that the food was at best mediocre.  I ordered the RACK OF LAMB and it was over cooked and was mostly grizzle and fat.  My wife ordered the Salmon in a soy sauce served in a clay pot, and the salmon was RAW in the middle when she cut it open to eat it, the rice was not completely cooked and was a skimpy portion.  The only thing that was good was the SPRING ROLLS with PORK.    I found that since the restaurant was expanded the quality and service  is less than expected.  I was a early adopter of the restaurant and made it my home for Vietnamese cooking now I am beginning to look for a better Vietnamese restaurant.  Originally Dennis the owner was very concerned with the quality of the food.  Since the restaurant was expanded, the wait staff is less attentive and the food is now rushed out of the kitchen without supervision."}
{"text":"Superior experience. Wait time for a table, so we sat at the bar and met the greatest people, both regular customers and staff. Food was wonderful and staff was great. Will be our date night spot while we are in Surprise."}
{"text":"What a difference two years makes (since the last time I was in this place).  I've been there almost 10 times in the past 4 months. The service is friendly and earnest, but the wait staff are usually either overwhelmed or just simply in a fog!  The food, however, is OUT OF THIS WORLD! The spring rolls are my favorite and a fantastic deal during their mid-day happy hours.  Everything else I've tried was also excellent.    I honestly don't know what I was thinking when we first visited this place in 2011.  Perhaps they are under new management???  Finally, a place which is very reasonably priced, healthy, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Been a regular for months. Ordered Chicken Fried Rice & Shrimp Spring Rolls. Very flavorful, delicious. Great food, staff is very polite & attentive. Nice cozy atmosphere. Zero complaints."}
{"text":"This place definitely serves authentic Vietnamese food.  It doesn't mean the food taste good.  What I tried:  Pho Dac Biet large bowl:  nice presentation but the broth was not very clear and a bit too sweet.  It doesn't have enough herb taste.  There were way too many meatballs and not enough of the other cooked meat.  The selection of Pho variation was limited.  No Pho Chin available.  I would not come here for their Pho.  Spring Rolls - Nem Nuong Cuon:  Decent all around.  Nothing bad to say but nothing spectacular to mention either.  Bun Cha Gio:  The egg rolls were nicely fried.  The taste was okay.  The vermicelli was a bit on the cold side and slightly too al dente for this dish.  They didn't stick together well which makes it difficult to pick up with the chopsticks.  I would prefer the noodles to be a bit warm.  This is probably one of the cleanliest Vietnamese restaurant you'll find in the valley.  Unfortunately, the food is just average."}
{"text":"Great food and great service here. I always come at lunch time so I'm not sure what it's like in the evening. The sizzling salmon is my favorite. I've tried about 10 things here and they were all very good."}
{"text":"One of the better asian fusion places in the west valley, and they just doubled in size. Great staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved Saigon Kitchen. Unfortunately, they were out of vegetarian broth (I'm a vegetarian), so a couple of menu items were out for me - pho included. Disappointing. Otherwise we had a great experience and were pleased with the fried rice, salad and salmon. Our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We will return."}
{"text":"This place OVER CHARGED for their food Go to another restaurant They try to make it all fancy and fancy but the bill is outrageous  The food is not even that good I stopped going their cause it was no good"}
{"text":"I find this restaurant in the higher-priced range. I ordered a large pho for pickup today. In the area I can get the same meal for a much lower price, almost half of what it is. The pickup took about 25-30 minutes.  ."}
{"text":"This place has a nice selection of egg rolls and Bahn Mi. The mother doesnt speak english very well and had a hard time taking my order over the phone. When I arrived the daughter apologized and was very friendly. I ordered avocado egg rolls and chicken Bahn Mi. As I waited in the dining room I noticed a huge dead cockroach under the table. I alerted  them and she retrieved it and threw it away. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. This is NC and there are huge water bugs/roaches that may have come in from outside It happens. The avocado eggrolls were meh, and the Bahn Mi was really good. The bread was light, and airy, with some daikon, carrots and cilantro to as well. Nice balance. I am looking forward to trying some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week (sometimes even twice a week...we're addicted!) and the food is amazing. We typically order shrimp and pork spring rolls and steak pho (side note: it's pronounced \"fuh\"). The staff is always incredibly friendly, and you'll typically get the same waiters/waitresses who will eventually get to know you. The owner, Dennis, is just about always on the premises and really takes care of his restaurant and socializes with customers quite often. I would definitely recommend this place... The price isn't too shabby either; typically about $30 (including tip) for us both."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this restaurant as it is one of the few restaurants in this area of Surprise that isn't a big commercial chain. I ordered the beef clay pot and he ordered the curry shrimp. Both dishes come with soup & salad. The soup was a very flavorful broth which had a few scallions. It had a hint of licorice flavor & was salted perfectly. The salad was a good portion of green leaf lettuce and no other vegetables with a tasty sesame vinaigrette. When the main dishes arrived, we were very disappointed. His curry shrimp had the frozen cut carrots and peas tossed with a modest amount of shrimp and lots of potatoes. The curry was not creamy or unique in any way, I could make this from a box and that's exactly what it tasted like. My claypot of beef was supposed to come with vegetables and on top of a clay pot that is so hot that it makes the rice crispy. The rice wasn't crispy at all. The beef lacked any real flavor because all the sauce was on the rice. The dish only came with a few carrots and 3 slices of mushrooms. Lacked originality and value."}
{"text":"My daughter and I tried Saigon Kitchen last week. We were really pleased with the food and the service there.   We shared a shrimp roll appetizer that was essentially a shrimp wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. It was delicious. I had the Shrimp Pho' along with the chicken on a stick (can't recall the exact name of the appetizer). It didn't come with a sauce, but was very moist. I normally hate chicken thighs but these were cooked in a way that disguised their taste to me, lol. I also ordered some peanut sauce to go with them.   My daughter had the garlic shrimp and noodles, at the recommendation of our waitress. After tasting her dish, I had plate envy. While my shrimp pho was tasty, it was lacking something- it needed more spices and the broth had a sweet quality to it that seemed odd. On the other hand, the sauce on the garlic shrimp with noodles was terrific - I could eat that all day. I was secretly hoping she couldn't finish her food so I would have a chance at having more.   The prices were a high for a lunch. I also had a to-go order for my husband - Saigon fried rice and an order of the chicken appetizer I had with the peanut sauce on the side - so with all that, the cost of the meal was $78.00, not including tip. BRW, my husband declared his food \"delicious.\"  He spent 4 years in Vietnam and got to know the food very well...  We will definitely go back here. We recently bought a house in Surprise and after it is done being remodeled, will move in a couple of months."}
{"text":"Love you his place. Come every time I'm in surprise. The shaken beef is to die for. Don't miss it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  I had the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef and my wife had the Saigon Stir Fry.  I would recommend mine over hers, but both were good.  Good ambiance, but we took our 2-year old...and the staff was very patient and helpful making sure we kept a happy baby at our table.  They do not have it on the menu, but they fixed a chicken and rice meal for her...she loved it.  I highly recommend if you are looking for good Asian food...hit up Saigon Kitchen."}
{"text":"Firecracker shrimp dish was excellent. Pork barbecue banh mi was below average. The texture was that of a pork meat ball that was sliced, and the bread was a little tough for a banh mi. The spiel I was given is that it is \"charbroiled pork shoulder.\" BS. I gave them a couple of chances to tell me the truth, but they kept saying it was BBQ. I'm a foodie so I know this was NOT BBQ pork. They should call it steamed pork product because that it what it tasted like. (The texture was like Spam). Our check also had an extra dish that we didn't order. It was corrected, but still annoying."}
{"text":"Love this place passionately!! Have been coming since it first opened and have never been disappointed with the food and dining experience! Staff is so gracious and lovely ... Food is delicious ... My fave is the beef pho and the garlic wings ... My husband is obsessed with the Vietnamese ribs! So happy to see it expanded this past year with more dining space as it was much needed!  I've brought family & friends in from the UK, California and Florida ... All of whom can't wait to come back and dine here when they return into town! Definitely a top spot in Surprise!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to eat in Surprise , the food and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"I can't believe how many years we've lived in Surprise and haven't tried Saigon Kitchen!  We had no experience with Vietnamese food and tried it on a whim. It was nothing like the images we had in our heads. This place is amazing! The food is very flavorful and there is something for everyone. Our 5 year old daughter loves it! If you're thinking about it, come. They are so nice and welcoming. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Excellent for the family, a date or dining alone.  Clean,  friendly and delicious.  Great, knowledgeable  staff. Unique asian dishes that are made from fresh ingredients.  Ask your wait what's good,  they'll know the whole menu.  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food! The wife and I were pleasantly surprised to find this gem nestled in the heart of fast food and corporate restaurant country out in Surprise.   What we have had: -Pho is good -Wings (Garlic Butter so far) -Shaken Beef is my favorite (med rare) -Garlic noodles were really good  I would highly recommend. Go there!!"}
{"text":"Shaken beef and pho! Small dining area but worth the wait and worth the trip. Check it out!"}
{"text":".... Caca.....over rated. Place fells like its falling apart...... Yes, nothing charming about an old building with a loose flooring.... cracking and squeaking....again....Caca......... Oh yah.....the pho ga..... Chicken bouillon cubes.... Thank you."}
