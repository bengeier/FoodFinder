{"text":"Great food,  attentive staff.  I haven't tried everything, but what I have has been great!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My all-time favourite restaurant. It's a nice, quiet restaurant that offers the best Indian/Thai food. Everything is made fresh, and made to order. You can absolutely taste the quality with each dish. My favourites are the Lamb Korma, Cashew Chicken, and the Saffron rice.   The restaurant can get quite busy, given the limited space. It's best to go the day before/after the holidays to avoid waiting.   The staff are always super friendly and super pleasant!"}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant and decided it would be fun to try something new/close to home... I was wrong.  I ordered the Butter Chicken as a takeout dish (from their menu online) and it came with salad, rice, and an option for Naan bread. (Which cost extra... yes, I was charged for Naan bread) It took them half an hour to make the food which I thought was a bit long but didn't think into it. They also asked if I was a first time customer on the phone and I said yes.  I picked up the food, paid almost $20 for it (which is ridiculously overpriced) and went home. When I got home I noticed they didn't include the salad or rice so I called them back. Turns out there are two options when buying Butter Chicken... the combo (the one I ordered which includes Salad or Rice) or just Butter Chicken. First of all, why ask if I'm a first time customer and not explain that there are two different Butter chickens!? Also, who eats Butter Chicken without rice!? Like, who would buy Butter Chicken and eat it with a fork alone? I've also never been charged for Naan bread before which was a surprise when I saw the bill.  Anyways... I made a stink and explained over the phone that I was not told about the two options and that I paid $20 for JUST Butter Chicken/Naan bread! (I could go to \"Oh Bombay\" on Winston Churchill and get more food for $8.00.) The lady said I can come back and get the Rice/Salad so I did. When I got there they tried explaining it and showing me their menu... yet their menu is different from their website!!! I also got a nice little talk about how I messed up my order from the waitress...  All in all: Overly priced food, small/dark restaurant (not enough natural light coming in) and bad service. I will not be going back or recommending this restaurant. If you want a good Indian place try Ambience of India or Oh Bombay; those are close by and very good."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good! I work nearby and I am there at least once a week. Their butter chicken with naan is to die for. Other really good stuff is their cashew nut chicken and chana masala with naan or rice."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have only been there a few times but we love it and would highly recommend it. It has a very intimate setting with soft lighting, relaxing music , exceptional staff and a romantic yet family like atmosphere. It is small but that is what makes it so personal!!  Please give it a try , you will definitely not be disappointed ! I promise!!  S&MD"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have had at a restaurant in living memory. This restaurant came recommended to us and the online reviews were similarly strong, but they do not represent our experience. The staff were very nice and we were optimistic about the Indian-Thai fusion cuisine because we love food from both of these countries. We started with the vegetable pakora which were soft, mushy and partially uncooked in the center. My wife's vegetarian korma had a green-grey colour instead of the creamy yellow it should have. The texture and taste were as if the base sauce had been sitting in the freezer for months. My chicken laziz tasted like it had come out of a grocery store bottle. The spices were poorly balanced and the chicken had been cooked separately in a skillet and then mixed into the sauce, so the taste of the curry did not penetrate the meat.   I find the Yelp rating of this restaurant bizarrely effusive. If you love food and especially if you love Thai or Indian you will be sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning. It's rare for me to be impressed by an Indian restaurant. This place did it. Many claim to cook from scratch but this place actually does it. The food is sublime with exquisite flavors and texture. An experience not to be missed!"}
{"text":"It is not the best Thai/Indian restaurant, but its not bad.  It is very tiny and like a lot of these types of restaurants the service is bad; it is slow and indifferent and cold."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Perfect combination of Thai and Indian cuisines. Their vindaloo is amazing. Butter chicken is amazing. Plus their green curry shrimp is to die for. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Mississauga. Amazing Indian curries and Thai dishes. Owners are very nice and friendly - I go here at least once a week! I'm addicted"}
{"text":"Shrimp Biryani is perfect. Too bad I didn't have them spice it up due to the kids potentially wanting some. Next time, will get the kids lots of garlic butter naan and go spicy. So many good items to try."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout lastnight for dinner...not bad. Nice small place. We ordered shrimp pad thai and yellow curry chicken with basmati rice and it was pretty good. I wouldn't say amazingly authentic but close enough and the spices were just right and I like the fact that they didnt go cheap with the shrimps in the pad thai like some restaurants out there.  I would definitely go back for dinner."}
{"text":"A little jewel in a strip mall. Good food, great naan & mango lassi, friendly service and good prices. The biryani is very spicy."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. Wonderful food! They are very consistent in flavour whether or not you dine in or order out. My favourite dishes are the Cashew Nut Chicken, and Butter Chicken. You can tell their food is made with love because I'm sure it takes a lot of time to develop the flavours in their dishes. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Mango Rain offers Indian food as if it was cooked at home, from scratch, by an Indian mega superstar chef!   Ok, let me start with the fact that my husband is Indian by descent and a gastro fanatic by his middle name. He is hardly ever happy with any restaurants we go to and usually the place has to be well above good to earn his second visit. But enough about the nature of my family policy on eating out choices.   We chose to dine at Mango Rain based on a list of great reviews on Yelp, Tripadvisor, Urbanspoon and Insauga. The three of us (me, my husband and his brother) were first turned down due to a packed Friday night, however, after calling back an hour later we were able to convince Peter, the host to book us a table before they closed. My husband and his brother were a bit sceptical of the place at first but boy were we surprised when the food arrived.   We ordered Shrimp Pakora, Coconut Soup, Vegetarian Lazis, Butter Chicken, some Naan bread and rice. Everything was AMAZING! We cook Indian food frequently at home, using only freshly ground spices, no commercial mixes. This is the first time ever, we had a food tasting just like made at home in a restaurant.   Mango Rain is a small place, but so are diamonds and they are very special. This diamond is worth coming back to.   P.S.: Sorry I have no mention regarding dessert, we were too full to have and but I do recommend the house Riesling."}
{"text":"The restaurant setting is a little bit more intimate as it is a small place, however they were able to accommodate a group of 7. Parking was definitely hard to find especially with other food options in the plaza, however we were able to squeeze into a small spot.   I got the chicken pad Thai with a mild spice level as I can't take any heat. However, they do offer a three tier spice level to their dishes - mild (0), medium (2), and hot (4) for those that like it spicy. Their lunch portions were generous and the pad Thai tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Both husband and wife work here and make delicious Thai and Indian dishes. Friendly atmosphere and great service! The best Mango salad. Eggplant Curry is a must have."}
{"text":"A very dear friend treated me to dinner here while visiting for work.  She had the vegetable Biryani and I very much enjoyed the Butter Chicken.  This is one of the restaurants that makes eating in the Toronto Mississauga area so enjoyable. This was absolutely the best Butter Chicken that I have ever had.  The sauce was super rich and flavorful and the chicken was so tender that I never used my knife.  Lastly, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Foods good, price is on the high side, staff is very friendly. Nice place for a date night."}
{"text":"We visit this Clarkson favourite at least twice a month and are never disappointed. Dishes take a little time even when the resto is not busy and for me that is a good sign.  The male server, who seems to be there only on weekends, is a hoot! E.G. If you point at a dish that is not one of his favourites he has been known to move your finger along the menu to a better choice. Satay Chicken, Aloo Gobi and Pad Thai top our list. Enjoy."}
{"text":"We got there early this past Thurs, around 5:45 pm and were the first people there. By 6:30 pm seven out of the ten or twelve tables were occupied. I recommend getting there early to avoid waiting as it is a popular local spot.   We shared a Thai Tom Kap Vegetarian soup ($6.45) and it delicious. A nice melding of coconut milk, lemon grass, and ginger as well as lots of vegetables. Large enough to share if you have an average appetite.   We loved the cashew chicken but made the mistake of not going with the co-owner's recommendation in terms if spice level. She suggested 4 was hot but we asked for level 6 hotness and that was too hot and over powered the subtle sweetness of the dish. They were generous with the cashews!   The vegetarian pad Thai ($13.95) was disappointing as the noodles were sticky (or over cooked) and lacked the subtle sweet (palm sugar) and tangy (from tamarind). A side of white basmati rice was $3.45.   One person ordered a 5 oz glass of the house wine.   Our total came to $50 + tip. My guest felt that was pricey for 2 but I thought it was okay.   Judging from the convo around me people living in the area came regularly and love the place.   Jack Darling Memorial Park is a 4 min drive and a lovely place to walk by the water after a delicious meal.   My friend recommended the lamb Laziz and I heard people around me ordering it while we were there.   I would go again."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. Really good service and friendly staff. Lamb vindaloo was tasty as was the chili chicken and eggplant dish. Service was good as well. One if the better places to dine out in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews lead me to try this place out and ... I'm not sure where they went but unfortunately the friendly and family run service didn't match up to the food.  I really don't want to provide a bad review but I do want to warn people to expect Thai food quality similar to ones you find in the food court but unfortunately more expensive.  So in downtown Clarkson and off in a really tiny old strip mall is Mango Rain.  It's a super tiny place alright... maybe only 10 tables in total with not a lot of seating.  The service is clearly run by a family with an adorable younger girl helping out.  I ordered by the phone and when I arrived, everything was set to go... or at least I thought it was.    With a simple order of the Thai vegetarian stir fried dish and an app of the chicken satay, the total came over close to $30.  It seemed on the higher end for 1 person but if it tasted good and good quality, I wouldn't have that much issue.  When I got back, I noticed there was no napkins, utensils ... nothing.  Though I guess I could have asked when I was in the restaurant but most places do include them that I've been lately.    Thai stir fried vegetarian dish (Pad Pak RaumMit) - When I opened up the container... call me surprised.  There was tons of liquid... and not a sauce but looks like a very heavy dark brown soup.  It was at least 2 cm deep.  Though this was a $14 dish, I've received more vegetables at other places for $10... and much better cooked.  The broccoli was over cooked and very mushy.  I couldnt tell if it was cooked from frozen but it definitely didnt taste right.  Same went for the the bok choy... overcooked to the point it was just like a wet tissue.  As for the 'soup'... Im not sure what is very Thai with it but it wasn't strong in any flavour... including Chinese soy based ones.  All in all... for $14, it certainly was not a good dish at all and only filled the container maybe 60%.  1/5  Chicken Satay - This app was better... mild grilled marks on it and it was bordering on being dry and overcooked but at least the marinade made it taste pretty good.  The peanut sauce wasn't very peanutty and the cucumber side salad literally fit in a tiny sauce container.  It was ok overall 3/5  I wish this was a better experience for me but I'm really puzzled on all the great reviews.  Owners maybe nice and kind but their kitchen isn't doing them any favours... if anything, I will unfortunately warn you to look for food elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to frequent close to home. Wonderful ambience. Service is a little slow but the wait is well worth it. I like the fact that unlike most other places that have simmered down their spice levels to cater to all types, this place actually gives you an option to pick your comfort levels of spice and the food is flavourful - both Indian as well as Thai or a fusion for some. Everything we ordered was fantastic"}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant - I'm so glad I tried this place a few weeks ago. Cosy restaurant, good food and friendly staff.  Yes the wait for food was a little long but all was forgotten when it did come. Will definitely recommend and visit the place again."}
