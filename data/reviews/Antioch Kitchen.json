{"text":"This place is amazing! All of appetizers, entrees and desserts are here all great tasting. The ambiance is great and the open kitchen keeps me entertained while I am waiting for my food. The servers are very kind, helpful, attentive and my food is served always perfect. Especially Antioch famous dessert called as Kunefe, is soo delicious. Definitely will be back to explore the menu more. Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Used to come here when it was under different ownership, the name was Babaganoush,  hadn't tried it since it switched over so thought I would. Ordered the falafel plate that came with salad, hummus and tahini. Firstly, the salad was completely drenched in oil. Not even any flavourful dressing. Just straight oil. Then I try a falafel ball and it was the most flavourless piece of deep fried shit I've ever had. Tried to drench it in tahini sauce to add some flavour but they clearly don't know how to season any of their food because their tahini was also bland and you could barely taste any lemon or garlic. Don't even get me started on the hummus. How do you mess up hummus? It was as if they had just taken chickpeas and blended them up without even seasoning them with salt, let alone garlic or anything else.   Extremely disappointed as I used to enjoy coming here when it was under different ownership. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Great value. I agree with the other reviewer that talked about the hummus with pine nuts... Fantastic. I wasn't expecting the pine nuts to come hot on top.  I spoke with the chef to find out how the pine nuts were prepared... Fried up with pure butter... Wow. So fantastic with the fresh warm pieces of traditional barbari bread. Thoroughly enjoyed the coban salata - now I will make one with my bbq steak tonight. So finish off the great meal with a traditional Turkish coffee and some of the best homemade backlava I have had in 20 years... Made by the chef's eldest sister. My Iranian buddy even did a reading of my leftover coffee grounds. Great things are ahead of me! I will be bring my wife for dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Superb authentic food that i ate lately. Very friendly 3 siblings are even better than the food. A must see place. I am a regular already."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and tasty, the portions are generous. They also serve free Turkish tea which I loved. The best Turkish food I ever had in GTA. Will go again."}
{"text":"Burnt chilli, soggy fries with oil pouring out all around is what I got delivered. The sauces were alright but leave a weird aftertaste."}
{"text":"I had visited Turkey a few years ago and since my trip, tried to visit a variety of Turkish restaurants around Toronto. Can't say that I was satisfied with the options here, most of them were passable, but Antioch Kitchen stands out as a lovely surprise. The family that owns this place is from Antioch, the southern region of Turkey, near the Syrian border. Very friendly and polite family, who really take pride in their business.   Located in a strip plaza, this restaurant was open late on the Easter Friday. When you walk in, you feel eyes turn onto you. Quickly, you realize that this is a local hangout and the table of regulars are simply curious as to who the fresh blood is. No one is rude, just a quick cursory glance; the staff pick up on it and approach to greet you. The decor here is simple, but serves the purpose. There is a low hum of busy chatter, in this relaxed atmosphere.   My sister and I were warmly met with lots of suggestions when we asked which dishes were vegetarian. We did the cold appetizer sampler - three dishes for $11.99, which is, hands-down, the best deal. The baba ganoush was excellent and the stuffed grape leaves are divine; a pomegranate sauce is used and makes the latter dish very unique! Fresh bread is provided in a basket; you'll never get anything from overnight.   The red lentil soup was also traditionally done and you are given a wedge of lemon to balance it out. Check if it's available; it is very popular and runs out if you are here late in the evening.  We chatted with our server, Nil, who was such a lovely server. She also offered complimentary Turkish tea, served in the classic hourglass cups that are very common to the country. It was brewed well, I make it at home on occasion, and I guzzled down a couple of glasses myself.   We had such a great time that we were here for two hours, chatting over delicious food. I'll definitely be coming back with my family and friends. Fantastic prices and an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Having read the Google reviews and in the mood for something different (because I like to explore) I stopped by Antioch on my way home from work and suggested my wife meet me there for dinner.  All the food is home cooked and very fresh, even for a Monday night. We spent some time with the owner of the restaurant, going over suggestions and decided on the falafel appetizer and the Adana shish kebab platter with 2 skewers of meat.  With 2 beers, this was quite a nice filling choice to split between the two of us.  We've eaten at a lot of middle eastern restaurants, and my wife goes to a great Turkish restaurant in NYC quite a bit, so we have points of comparison.  The food at Antioch was all very tasty and fresh and we will definitely return for more.   PS - the baklava is made by hand by the owner and is worth trying for dessert.  It's different than the typical Greek baklava. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great prices and amazing service! Great place to bring the kids. I have been here a number of times and the food has been consistently excellent. Great quality, big portions and tons of flavour."}
{"text":"Omg yum. This place made kebabs great again! I can't rave enough about their hummus with pine nuts either, that might actually contain cocaine because I couldn't stop eating it.  We came for a team event and our coworker whose idea of good food was Mandarin ended up falling in love with Turkish cuisine.  I'm a downtown foodie with access to great restaurants all around my neighborhood, but Antioch Kitchen is something special and I will be making a pilgrimage there again."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the food delicious!! The garlic sauce is super garlicky. Everything was so fresh.   There are a few beers to choose but only two wines - one red and one white. I didn't try the wines.   The spice on the chicken shish was like nothing I've had before. Really excellent!  Food is big.. we got a doggy bag and it was packaged for us so nicely."}
{"text":"The best Turkish Restaurant I've been in Toronto! Great food, great service, great atmosphere, and a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"RESPONSE TO KATIE S. BELOW... ha! ha!... yet another predictable, brainless Yelp troll working for a jealous competitor or a jaded ex-supplier who doesn't know what she's talking about. CLEARLY you've never set foot in this restaurant judging by the OVERWHELMING positive response on all the review platforms including this one. You must be confusing it with the previous restaurant that used to be in the same location because that place was indeed garbage. But you loved it!... lol, \"I used to enjoy coming here when it was under different ownership.\" Your tastebuds must be dead... smoke much?  FYI toots, the new Antioch Kitchen is REAL Turkish food. Not the drive thru crap you're use to eating. Their salad is flavourful and fresh! It's not just straight olive oil. Sadly for you, they don't serve dimestore Thousand Island dressing. FLAVOUR is the Antioch's middle name! Their three signature sauces are an unmatched flavour explosion. And their hummus is off the chain! It's full of wonderful seasoning. I've eaten hummus at some of the best middle eastern restaurants in the city and the Antioch's hummus doesn't take a back seat to any of them. You say... \"they clearly don't know how to season any of their food\". Really? So you've sampled their entire extensive menu have you? Proof once again you're nothing but a spineless Yelp troll. Do us all a flavour and disappear."}
{"text":"This is just a comment to mention that the staff are nice people. I didn't actually buy anything but the food smelled good."}
