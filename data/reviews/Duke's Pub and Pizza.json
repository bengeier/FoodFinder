{"text":"It's now under new ownership as \"Mt Lebanon Pub and Pizza\" and we've been very pleased with it. We've had all manner of \"bar food\" from pizza, fries, quesadillas, hoagies, calzone, and  the \"munchie platter\" (fried cheese, potato skins, wings, fries).  We've not had a bad menu item yet.  Their pizza is our favorite, and their homemade ranch dressing is out of this world. They also do karaoke upstairs on Friday nights with one of the most fun and friendly karaoke djs we've ever had the pleasure to sing with (and she has a tremendous database of songs!), and their server/bartender for that event is the best! :-) It's not crowded or rowdy, and it's a great place to spend the evening."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Though I never ate at the former location in Bethel Park, I wrongly assumed that an established business would have good food and good service.   The very young hostess seated us right by the door on a day when it was 27 degrees outside. There were at least 10 empty tables where she could have seated us. She just wanted us to sit down so that she could go back to talking to her friend who was sitting at a nearby table.   There was a man who I gather is the owner seated at the table next to us who heard us talk about how cold it was. He even watched me put my coat on because it was THAT cold. He had a small space heater at his feet and enough meat on his bones so I assume he didn't notice that it was freezing.   I looked past that because I was so excited that the Pub and Pizza building was finally occupied again. We anxiously waited for our server to come and take our orders. We didn't wait too long.   The woman was friendly enough but when we asked what they have to drink, she said she didn't know because she doesn't have a list. We asked if they have beer and she said yes then proceeded to list off your standard dive bar drafts and a vanilla 'port.' Um... Porter?   We ordered our drinks as well as a pizza and some provolone sticks. When the pizza came she put it on a wobbly pizza stand and dropped off the cheese sticks. The pizza stand was so wobbly I thought the pizza may slide off.   The food didn't look good. The cheese sticks weren't browned. They were sad, skinny sticks that were taken out of the freezer and dropped in the fryer. I've had better cheese sticks in a cafeteria.   As for the pizza, it was terrible. Soggy and shiny - two things that food should not be. I'm sorry but if you have 'pizza' in your name, you should at least have a decent pie. It's laughable considering all of the good pizza in a 2 mile radius of the joint.   We finished what we could and wanted to leave but our server disappeared. I went to the bar to ask if we could cash out. The bartender looked at me as if I were an alien. The owner rolled his eyes. He didn't even seem to care that his employees was weren't taking very good care of his customers.   Rather than cash me out, the bartender went to find the server. Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to take our card.   All in all it was a bad experience. By the time we left we felt like the place didn't want customers. It's sad because they are in a good location. They won't last long unless they do huge business selling bud light and karaoke."}
{"text":"Duke's is as bland as it gets:  boring beer selection, soggy pizza, zero atmosphere.  It is far more interesting to sit on your couch with a 7-up and a poached egg watching a Yule Log video than it is to visit Duke's Pub and Pizza."}
{"text":"Have only been there once since they reopened, but I would definitely go back.  It's a nice casual restaurant with friendly staff.  The hoagies were excellent.  The pizza looked good, I plan to try it next time."}
{"text":"I have been at this place 3 times and every time it has gotten better   The pizza was great and we enjoy happy hour at the bar it's nice to have a neighborhood bar and restraint back at this location. If you came earlier give them another chance"}
{"text":"Pub and Pizza is a neighborhood treasure for fantastic food at a great price. Admittedly, this review is based on a single menu item (the steak salad). But we were blown away by the freshness and quality of our meals. The steak was perfectly cooked and the salad was chock full of veggies, including carrots, green peppers, mushrooms and crunchy lettuce. Everything was topped with crispy fries (because we are in Pittsburgh!) Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is incorrectly named in Yelp. It is no longer Dukes Pub and Pizza.  It's Mt Lebenon Pub and Pizza.   That said... The atmosphere is good a along with the usual great pizza.  There are craft and domestic beer specials.  Check with them on food special s too!  I also have friends that have rented out the upstairs bar for parties.  Not a bad family restaurant."}
{"text":"Just wanted to try since they just opened very recently. Was seated by the door with other tables available and gave up after waiting 10 minutes with no waitress/server coming by. The place was not busy. As far as the menu goes, they have typical plain pizza with many chices, calzones, rib, sandwiches, dinners. Nothing that fancy."}
{"text":"My family lives within walking distance of this restaurant so we really wanted to like it but unfortunately there weren't really any redeeming qualities.  We ordered a small pizza, chicken Parmesan sandwich and a chicken fajita wrap.  The food was bland and I ended up adding hot sauce to everything.  The waitress seemed put off when we asked for extra marinara sauce.  Also there were a few servers hanging out at the bar (we were seated upstairs) and one was talking about how her ex-boyfriend cheated on her and got someone else pregnant.  They were right next to us and we have a two year old son!  Also, neither our greeter/seater nor server offered to get us a high chair or booster and we had to find it ourselves.    I don't really think this restaurant will last which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Menu is shockingly limited for those wishing to eat in a healthful way. Decor is dated and I have heard completely unchanged from a restaurant that closed 10 years ago. Unimaginative menu and dingy decor makes me question why I would come back. The pizza I ordered was...pizza. The beer offerings were less than average. I would also add that this place should focus more on quality rather than quantity. They may get my business again, but I'll wait till they enter the modern restaurant era."}
{"text":"Good place to meet some friends.  We had a large group meet at Duke's to have a little holiday cheer.  Service was good considering how crowded it was.   The bar was overwhelmed by our group and another group.  We had some pizza and wings.  The pizza had a medium crust and was good.  The wings were somewhat crispy and tasted good."}
{"text":"Good pizza, the dough was good with a nice chew.  The calzones are huge.  The waitstaff were attentive.  Duke's just opened in this location?  The beer selection was o.k., Sam Adams winter ale was the only decent beer on tap, but the do offer bottled beer. I will return!"}
{"text":"Nice to see this old place up and running again. Nostalgia aside, the rotating draft list has a few nice micro brews, and the pizza prices are all very fair, and quite tasty too!"}
{"text":"My original review was on Duke's Pub and Pizza.  Since my original review the location has been renamed to Pub & Pizza.  It is under new management.  I received a yelp message last week from Courtni - from Pub & Pizza.  She had read my review and wanted to offer us a coupon to give the location another shot.  I took her up on her offer - as I mentioned previously, they are very close - and our first visit was not impressive.  Now to my review.  :)  I ordered the Philly Burger; son #1 had a Ruben, son #2 had an order of 12 wings - mild spice.  My Burger was cooked as I ordered it - well seasoned.  Very filling.  My side salad (House) was standard, no bells and whistles, but it's hard to mess up Salad.  My only suggestion would be with a burger that great - you need your vegtables to steal the show also - perhaps a creative sauce or something on the peppers/onions/mushrooms.  Overall I was happy with the meal.  My son LOVED his Reuben, he says that the bread was crunchy, the amount of meat was huge!  He had a side of coleslaw and he enjoyed that as well.  The wings, my son loves wings, he said these were OK.  He did take them home - he ordered the mild spice - and said to him they tasted ok, but the spice was weird flavored.  lol  I tasted them and they tasted fine to me.  Not sure what he was expecting.   I will say the food has improved overall.  The menu is new.  The staff was friendly and wanted to make sure we were taken care of.  Thank you to the Pub & Pizza in going the extra mile to make sure your customers are satisfied."}
