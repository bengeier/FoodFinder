{"text":"Placed an order yesterday for lunch delivery today.  We called and were told they never received our order, even though they took credit card payment for it over the phone.  Now we are having to scramble to get lunch for 10 people somewhere else 1.5 hours late.  They are overpriced as it is, but to completely lose an order is pathetic.  Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We ordered boxes for a meeting and placed the order last week. The order was short a box and they couldn't deliver it until 1:30. The meeting was at 11. Are we supposed to all eat in front of the one without? My boss ordered a burrito from the restaurant nearby and ate that. Shame we won't be ordering from here again. I liked my thai wrap. Not a fan of the cookies but I'm not an oatmeal raisin fan. I would like to give a higher rating but reliability is important when ordering business lunches. So the next day Ingallina's dropped off the missing meal. We were never charged for it so it ended up being free. I upped the rating to 3 stars since they tried to make up for it. My boss gave me the lemon cookie which was very good."}
{"text":"the office ordered lunch today from here and EVERYBODY was happy with their food! The meals come in these fabulous cardboard boxes, complete with cookies, water, fruit and the main item and it's wrapped in tissue paper. The items ranged from salads to sandwiches and we all agreed that this was one of the best lunches we all had experienced and everyone was super happy with their food (which is a hard feat to accomplish in an office!)  The employees are friendly and got the order correct and delivered it in a timely manner. We will definitely be ordering from them again soon. :)"}
{"text":"What a terrific lunch ! Sara LaVant is a gracious \"ray of sunshine\". She delivered lunch to our Scottsdale Copenhagen Furniture store yesterday. It was a very generous amount and the variety was perfect to satisfy all of the diverse palates here at the store. I look forward to the next delivery....my afternoon was much more productive than when I work through lunch or grab an apple at my computer. Many thanks Sara, from all of us at Scottsdale Copenhagen."}
{"text":"Great job ! Our office ordered box lunches, wraps and salads. Fast service and rave reviews by all. We will use you again in future for events."}
