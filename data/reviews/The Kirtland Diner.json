{"text":"My review is the complete opposite of Dave D. from ORANGE COUNTY, CALI!   He needs to READ the description of the business he wants to go to.  If you don't pay attention, you don't get to complain.  Had i been in there, i would have gladly made a call for a WHHHAAAAAMBULANCE for him.  They are right down the road."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after staying the night in Kirtland - enroute to my folks home.   WOW - what a gem of a diner in an out of the way place. Yeah, the decor is nothing special, but the waitress was super friendly, the food was great (and affordable) and we really felt at home. We'll stop in again, next time we pass through.  I'm sure a party of 14 might not get perfect service - it's a small place and I'm sure they don't often get that many. But my small party of 3 really had a great time and I wish this place was in my home town. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very good food at extremely good prices. Food came out fast and the server was awesome. This is a great diner for breakfast or lunch. Not sure on dinner-we came around lunchtime."}
{"text":"How can the place mess up eggs how can I place make terrible toast they cook it on the grill and it's saturated with grease bacon is soggy  asked for crispy potatoes.  Nope barely cooked.you wonder why no one ever goes there how do they stay open your after year amazing"}
{"text":"This is a great little small town restaurant to enjoy a good meal that is not rushed or part of a chain. The staff is friendly and our neighbors if you're from Kirtland. A few items that are very good. The corn beef hash is homemade, the pancakes and French toast are very good. If your order is wrong or cooked incorrectly it is fixed right away to your satisfaction. The prices are low and the quality is good. I grew up in a small town and this is the real deal small town diner."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice place to get some well prepared food at a good price this is your place.  So we are hiking at Chapin Forest on a cold Sunday afternoon and we need a place to get some lunch, Yelp shows some good reviews for the Kirtland Diner and we figure we will give it a try.   The Kirtland Diner is a small family run restaurant located in a store front in a small strip mall on Route 306.  The space is relatively small with about a dozen small tables.  The walls are painted in a light teal with some very nice Kirtland pictures.  The menu is pretty straight forward with one full page of all day breakfast items and one page of lunch/dinner items which is mainly sandwiches.    I ordered the Pancake breakfast with 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and substituting hashbrowns for meat.  The pancakes were nice large cakes, well cooked with just the right amount of sponginess to soak up the syrup.  The 2 eggs over medium were well cooked with just the right amount of yolky goodness.  The hashbrowns were good, especially the crispy parts.  Overall a very well prepared breakfast.   The other highlights that were ordered at the table were the Steak Sandwich, with a large steak overflowing the bread with melted cheese and a nice helping of french fries and a nice salad topped with grilled chicken that was nicely put together and had a huge portion of chicken.  I also have to compliment the service; we called ahead to let them know we were coming and they had the table put together for us.  There was no problem with with separate checks and some special requests.  The waitresses were friendly and clearly knew what they were doing.  Kirtland Diner is not the place for fancy or upscale food; what you will get is good solid food well prepared in a nice casual environment.  If you are in the area give them a try."}
{"text":"WARNING! CASH OR CHECK ONLY. THERE IS NO SIGN INDICATING THIS  The food was really great, which is the only reason it is getting a 2 star rating.   Server was inattentive or was not attentive to me based on looks. I ran out of coffee AND water and wasn't offered anymore at all until she came to give me my check and my meal was finished; which I was done with for 5 mins. A lot of these issues wouldn't bother me if I wasn't only 1 of 2 customers in the small diner. Overall very poor experience and I don't plan on visiting this place again. Again, hats off to the cook, food was delicious."}
{"text":"Set in the corner of America's smallest strip mall is this little gem of a diner. Modestly furnished, and cash only, this small diner serves traditional fare, for breakfast and lunch. They offer daily specials for each that are both set specials and the whim of the cook that day. The staff are locals who are friendly and fast, and easy to talk to.   Cheaper than McDonalds, better food, walking distance to the Kirtland Temple. The walls have photos about the local history and attractions. A good place to start your visit."}
{"text":"Quality, authentic, cheap. What more could you ask for? Staff is awesome. Menu is packed.  Only issue I have is that it's so filling I can't order one of everything. Pancakes and potato pancakes heavily recommended."}
{"text":"I give it four stars because I don't give five stars very often, but I was truly impressed with this little place. The waitress was very nice and real. The food (we had the burger/fries special) was amazing. I am not a huge fan of burgers, but this was as homemade tasting as I have had. The tomatoes were incredible and were from the owner's father-in-law's garden. The   special was $4.00. Where in this country can you find a deal like that?! It was far better tasting than a $10.00 burger that we ate in many other restaurants. Hands down a great place!  There was absolutely nothing wrong with the service."}
{"text":"so why is it hard to find a decent breakfast place with reasonable prices... the Kirkland diner is a complete dump and I don't suggest anyone to go there. very watered down weak coffee runny eggs un-flavored bi-product sausage links eggs Benedict with no sauce on it and only 3 small leafs of spinach on the the ben that was a special!! lol ..the hash browns were cut large pieces of uncooked potatoes and were not cooked thoroughly pancakes were thin not fluffy with no flavor. and my scrambled eggs looked like they were cooked in a dirty pan with what looked like black oil streaks ... the server was not very friendly we asked for water several times before michelle had to go out to the car and get a bottle of water. wait time was extremely long in fact we waited close to 35 mins and during that time another 3 people came in sat down had food within 10 mins as we waited. by the time our food came that party of 3 that got served fast was done eating and on the way out the door!! and not sure if they had AC but it was stuffy inside ... they are lucky on review sites that they at least get 1 star cuz they need allot of improvement!!"}
{"text":"There is a waitress/cook named Janet ... She's amazing!  Great to talk to is very attentive to your needs and boy can she cook!  Great little place where you can relax with a small town feel.  When I stop in and she's not there I don't stay.. She really is worth the trip and she's worth a 20% tip!! Best waitress EVER!   Guess that's why she was Miss Commerce of Lake County last year."}
{"text":"Ok, small town Diner for the win!!!!!  Great food! VERY great prices and if you get Janet, you will not be disappointed!  Janet honestly made my friends and I feel so welcome and so happy!  The chili and soup are terrific and so are the pancakes!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Well I woke up and wanted to drive to a small town and get breakfast with my girlfriend. I picked this diner from yelp to see what it's all about. When we arrived I loved the feel of it when we walked in. We were greeted by a young lady towards the back of the restaurant to seat ourselves. We picked a booth. The feel of the diner was very small town. You could hear voices echo in this building. I loved the color blue paint on the walls and the flag on the wall. I could envision a movie being filmed here for the aesthetics and the sound from the echoes.         As for the food it was good.The only complaint is the service was not very good. I'm not sure if it was our server's first  day but she forgot a lot of little things I asked for. I might try it again in the future."}
{"text":"In town for first time, checked Yelp and chose this place. Food was OK. The 'hamburger' was actually a very thinly sliced skirt steak on sourdough toast. OK, sure, that's fine. Fries were extremely average. But the WORST part is, when I went to pay my bill, the waitress said, \"Sorry, we don't take credit cards, only cash and checks\". First of all, a sign ANYWHERE in the establishment alerting me to this retail anomaly in 2017 America would have prevented me from ordering a meal there in the first place, and sent me down the road to someplace that deals in current payment methods. Secondly, I haven't written a check in like, 10 years. A check? Really? I don't even OWN checks. THEN, the waitress suggested that I could walk two parking lots over to an ATM, which of course, I was forced to. It was a bank that charged me $3.50 for having a card out of their system and an additional $1.50 for being \"out of area\". No, seriously. So, a $5 surcharge on a $14 tab, BEFORE tipping the waitress, whose fault, this was not. My advice: avoid this place. If you want to deal only in cash, drive to an authentic Amish place and have an old school dining AND paying experience."}
