{"text":"I purchased a Barbecue at Barbecues Galore 18 years ago, yes 18 years ago. The brand was Cook-On, which was made specifically for Barbecues Galore. While believe it or not it still works, it was starting to show its ago. Since I had such good luck, I thought I would go back. Upon entering I was Greeted by Ramiz Cajic. When I mentioned my 18 year old BBQ, he knew exactly what I was talking about. We discussed many options including rebuilding the old one (which still can be done).  I opted instead for a new one. Ramiz is an exceptional Sales Representative of this company.  He reviewed with me in detail what my needs were and helped me make the correct choice, helped me load the BBQ in my truck and made sure everything was done correctly. Unfortunately after getting it home and unboxing, it was found to have a defect (no fault of Barbecues Galore), must have occurred in shipping from manufacturer. I called Ramiz and he said to simply bring it back. He even stayed late after his normal end of day to wait for me. Ramiz made the return process smooth as silk, no issues  no questions asked, and made sure the refund would be processed quickly. I would have just exchanged, but they were out of stock on that model.  If you are in the Market for a new Barbecue, or need to replace parts or get accessories, this is the store for you, and Ramiz is the guy to ask for! (I am sure the other guys are great as well), but Ramiz went above and beyond to assist me so I highly recommend him."}
{"text":"Next time you advertise a contest with prizes it would be nice to know that you require a customer to spend $100 for an entry blank. Pretty cheesy in my opinion."}
{"text":"Agreed.  Customer service at this location is such a joke.  I don't understand how this place is still in business.  All the reviews of BBQ galore are horrible and everything is overpriced.  I am a avid grillmaster and I always want to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but everytime I come in, I walk away disappointed.  Chris, if you are the manager of this location...you might want to hire a more friendly staff.  This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Beware of the Yelpers that give negative reviews, may I suggest watching the South Park episode on this as it is right on in so many ways, news for everyone out there most consumers suck!  This a great store with a whole team of people that are happy to help in any way. They are accessible in the store, online and on the phone and will work with you if you need help along the way. Now a days grills and outdoor appliances are complicated so it takes some time to correct items that could be a problem. No point in going anywhere else for any of your outdoor cooking needs!"}
{"text":"Jake failed to provide me with the hose to connect the patio heater I purchased and when I called back, after reviewing the manual, which describes the hose, Jason (another salesman) denied that it should have come with hose.  So maybe it did not?  But I suppose I would have thought they (Jake) would tell you that a hose was required, and not included, for an additional $50.00.  However, I did receive a call back shortly thereafter from Chris (manager) and he kindly provided me with a hose.  Review from 1 star to 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have been shopping at BBQ Galore for about 14 months.  I usually shop in the Chandler location, but ended up stopping by the Scottsdale location near desert ridge.  After experiencing the lack of customer service I will not be shopping here ever again.  As a consumer, I have purchased a grill, smoker and other various items such as brushes, sauces, wood chips, and other utensils for BBQing.  I went into the desert ridge location on January 27th around 1:00.  I purchased woodchips, bbq sauce, rub, and rib racks.  I even told the sales representative I dont think these racks are going to fit in my smoker, but I'll buy them anyways. I ended coming back 1 hour later and wanted to refund the rib racks.  As I expected the rib rack wouldn't fit in my smoker.  The sales rep refused to take back the product and said \"the box was in poor condition and will not be taking this back.  The same sales representative that I purchased my products from earlier.  He mentioned the manager Chris will be in tomorrow if I wanted to talk to him.  I left the store, pretty ticked off.  In conclusion, I have dropped over 1200.00 in the past 14 months and never had any issues with the store.  I even have recommended people to this place.  My friends of mine have told me, that I should just shop at Home Depot down the road, cause they are cheaper and have the same products.  Because the sales representative at BBQ Galore, refused to take my rib rack, which was 15 dollars, you guys have lost me as a customer and I will never recommend this place again.  Also I will post on every social media sites, such as facebook, yelp, white pages how horrible the customer service is, and how badly they treated me.  So instead of refunding my product that I purchased for 15.00 bucks, you have lost a customer and someone that will bad mouth how bad this place is.  I even explained to the sales rep how poor this is and this is not how you treat someone that has dropped so much money at your stores.  Piss poor customer service"}
{"text":"I used them for my built in BBQ grille and could not be happier. Ramiz my salesman is very special and really gets the job done. Now for the best part, we also bought two sets of fireplace gas logs. I wanted the remote operated ones and he advised me against it. But I ordered anyway ! What do you know 4 months later they quit working. At my choice the gladly exchanged for the non remote logs. Ramiz is the best."}
{"text":"They said I would have the product, a large Big green egg within a week, after 2-1/2 weeks and broken promises I cancelled the order and went down the street to another store"}
{"text":"If Yelp allowed minus stars, BBQ Galore would have gotten minus 5!  I bought a large gas grill, 2 side burners and a Big Green Egg to be installed in my new-build home.  I paid for delivery and installation.  The grand total was over $4000.  The outdoor kitchen was built to the specifications in the documentation for the grill and the home had passed the county inspection.  Delivery was promised between 9 and noon on a specific day.  The delivery arrived at 2:30pm.  I was home and the construction supervisor for the builder was on-site.  The delivery person brought the grill and the Egg to the kitchen and then stated that he couldn't install it because the kitchen was not properly vented.  The construction supervisor told the installer that it was built to specification and showed him the venting.  He refused to install the grill and was surly and uncooperative.  The construction supervisor offered to work with him but he left without assembling the grill.  He put the Egg together but left no documentation for either the grill or the Egg.  I called the store and spoke to the person who had sold me the package.  I told him that the installer had been rude and uncooperative.  He stood up for the installer saying that the grill could not be installed.  I asked to speak to the store manager and when he came on he repeated that the installer was right.  When I asked where the builder had varied from the installation instructions, the store manager hung up on me.  The grill was installed by the builder and we are using the internet to find instructions on the Big Green Egg.  I did not hear from the store again and did not receive a refund on installation.  I plan to post this review everywhere and suggest that you buy your grill products elsewhere."}
{"text":"I purchased a new built in grill. Jake (salesman) was extremely helpful. His professionalism made for a great shopping experience."}
{"text":"Wow I cannot describe my disappointment with the follow up customer service of this store.   My husband and I bought a BBQ from here on Feb 20th and spent over $800. Within three weeks, one of our burners stopped working. There is clearly a problem with the propane getting delivered to this particular burner because it will not ignite now matter what you do. I have been calling BBQ's Galore for the past six days to try and get this fixed to no avail.   On Tuesday, I spoke with someone both at this location and the Chandler location and was told that someone from the scheduling department would be in contact with me to schedule a service call. Fast forward two days and I have still not heard anything from anyone until tonight when I received a very disappointing call from Matt the manager of the Chandler location. Matt was beyond rude and unhelpful. He informed me that no service call had been ordered and pretty much offered me no solution. I was told that to order a service call I have to go into the store in person to pre pay for it - funny this was never mentioned to me by the other THREE people I have spoken to regarding this problem.  The bottom line is I would like to get my less than a one month old barbecue fixed and apparently the store that I bought it from has absolutely no interest in assisting me do so - how is this acceptable customer service?"}
{"text":"God these guys are so rude. It's like, it's not enough you're overpriced- but basic phone and customer service manners are non-existent.   Called them with a simple request after regretfully spending 1200 on a BBQ from these dbags and the hillbilly who answered the phone was next level rude- do yourself a favor, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"my wife and i came in today, Ron helped us. Very pleased the store, the grills he showed us. He was very helpful, great customer service. We will be back when we are ready to put our yard in. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Great selection of Bbq/smoking needs!"}
{"text":"Barbeques Galore has a wide selection of pre-built and custom islands to satisfy all of your backyard entertaining needs. However, they did not have most of the stuff I was looking for. Upon entry a nice greetings at the door.  Walked into this place it was dead but it seemed like they had a good selection of BBQ's ranging from the good to high end grills (high end meaning chef grill). The prices are a slight bit high but  you get what you pay for. The people that work here were fantastically helpful and knowledgeable.  Definitely check this place out if you're in the market for a grill. You can get your questions answered and there's no hassle to buy.

{"text":"This is a message more for management then customers.  A 20% restocking fee on an off the shelf item is unrealistic.  If you want Amazon to put you out of business, keep charging that fee."}
{"text":"Went here to replace my 18 year old Turbo natural gas grill. George Kirk was awesome no high pressure and helped me out with the new model for it was a little different in size and had to fit into my existing island.  He gave me all the dementions of the new one. I went home measured and went back the next day to pick up my grill.  It was a excellent experience, George gave me everything I needed plus a loyalty discount.  I went home, made a few cuts in the island and in about a hour the new grill was in and operational. I highly recommend George Kirk and Barbeques Galore ."}
{"text":"have a BBQ galore out door kitchen from 07  it has everything..6 burner grill, two burner top stove, 3 drawers, pull out for the gas tand and a built in refrigerator. The refirg. finally died. So I researched all frig's that should fit into the space..4.5 QF types...nothing be found that would fit into the space. Went to BBQ galore on Tatum (as the Camelback store is no more) took my Maxi cool refrig. book with me and  showed the salesman a picture of the item that they were selling. I asked him to talk to the manager to make sure the frig would fit into the space. Yup, the manager said yes...it was the \"same exact size\". bought it, took it home. A few days later I had my guy there to help slide the old one out and slide the new one it...you got it..didnt fit..old frig 19 inch and change..this ne 20 inch and change wide. I already knew the other frig begin sold at bBQ galore was way to big to fit. so I had my guy alter the space so this thing would fit...I did call BBQ galore and let them know it did not fit and asked them to provide some compensation for me having to pay for the frig to fit.. nope.not never, wouldn't ( the manager from Chandler place called first as the other guy was on vacation) The tatum location manager did call me about a week later.. same thing..nope, not, to bad..even though they know there are no other frig'es out there at will fit into the space. my point...they gave me mis information. they don't care about old customers who have purchased outdoor kitchens from the prior BBQ galore company.  They do not make a frig that will fit into the space... so when your frig goes bust and you bought your kitchen a few years ago.. be prepared...their frigs do not fit..and no other ones are available...sears..wrong size etc...good luck.  I will stay away from BBQ galore."}
{"text":"Went in here on a Sunday just before Christmas.  The one previous time I had been here was about 10 years ago.  This trip was for a digital probe that I just had to have on a Sunday and I figured correctly they would have one.  The store is clean and well laid out.  The staff was helpful and knew exactly where to find what I was looking for.  The only downside is the place is not cheap.  I paid several dollars more than suggested list price for my purchase.  But what is a guy to do when he decides he needs a probe after he had already applied the dry rub?"}
{"text":"I made a long drive up to Desert Ridge to buy a side burner to go in my new outdoor kitchen. My sales consultant was Ramiz. He was very helpful, super friendly and mad sure everything fit into my car perfectly. I wanted to buy the whole store because they have so many realy cool items. I will certainly come back as we continue to work on my new project. Make suure you ask for Ramiz!"}
{"text":"Very helpful and even called me 1 week after purchase to discuss what I have bbqed and what I think of my new grill. Gave me some tips and pointers. Thanks Rick!"}
{"text":"It's always great when you find a place with great products, excellent service, and reasonable prices. The guys here helped me try to repair my existing grill but it was too old to get the parts. I bought a replacement grill on Black Friday for a nice price. It's stainless and the right size. The technical support was great. I installed it myself with their phone help when I had a question. I highly recommend these guys."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this store again.   Someone who works there, manager? owner? Thinks it is their god given right to park in the street just to the east of this store. So what happens is this car sits there and leaves enough room for only one car to pass. I've seen this on just about every Friday I go by the place on my way to another business next door.  Now add in a landscaping crew with a giant truck and the road is completely blocked, making an already congested parking lot even worse.  I used to shop here quite frequently but the arrogance of whoever this is just sealed the deal for me that I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Having no luck finding a Weber Smokey Mountain, I drove a little further south to Barbecues Galore. Really, these two stores should switch names. BBQ Island does, indeed, have barbecues galore while this place is much smaller.   They do have supplies, some grills and smokers on display, fireplaces and other stuff. It is just on a much smaller scale than their nearby competitor.   The good thing is, normally, it is easier to have questions answered here. Also, they actually had the smoker I was looking for."}
{"text":"They are very nice to you right up to the point you make a purchase.  If you have any issues with the purchase, good luck."}
{"text":"When I built a home in Las Vegas in 2000, I had a BBQ Galore grill put in next to our pool. It functions great to this day, much better than portable units I have used over the years.   We went to BBQ Galore to buy a BBQ and a fire pit for our new home in Scottsdale. A very pleasant salesman, Ramiz, came up to us and introduced himself. He wasn't pushy & didn't try to upsell us something we didn't want. But, Ramiz really knew BBQs! He was extremely helpful in picking out the right unit for us.   We had been looking for a fire pit to go next to our pool for several months. BBQ Galore had one that we just loved. Unfortunately, it was way over our budget. We must have gone back to look at the BBQ & the fire pit multiple times over the next couple of months. Ramiz always remembered our names and was even cracked jokes with us.   On one of our last visits, Ramiz mentioned in a couple of weeks the store was having a sale but, after checking with his manager, they would give us the special pricing before the sale. Much to our surprise, we decided to buy the fire pit as it was a deal we couldn't turn down.  The fire pit was recently delivered by one guy who was incredibly strong and carried the disassembled unit by himself. He did a fine job in putting the fire pit together and showing me all of the important features of it.   Unfortunately, we didn't have enough budget left over to buy a BBQ, but we will be back and will ask for Ramiz. Overall, we are very satisfied with everybody we came into contact with from BBQ Galore."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff that assisted me with my gift needs this year, and offered to find an out of stock item at another location.  Good selection of products in the store itself, and the parking wasn't so bad.  Easy to find location that is visible from Bell Rd. itself.  They have sauces and such too, not just the basics of barbeque equipment."}
