{"text":"This is the first time I had Mango Flats. To be honest I was not impressed for a couple of reasons. For one, I ordered the Cheese Pizza Flatbread which was $7.00, not a bad price! But it was not tasty. Secondly, when I received my bill via email they charged me a $1.00 tip without my consent. I was definitely disappointed in that. Thirdly, the side salad was an \"OK\" portion, but the salad dressing was looked like a shot glass. Lastly, I thought that the staff in the truck were not professional when writing down your name. What I mean by that, is that the lady was saying how she didn't care how she was writing down my name. I said to myself, really. For those reasons I gave it a 1 star."}
{"text":"Literally the worst customer service. We had them scheduled at work and they were half an hour late. When they got there they kept moving the truck around even after seeing people start to line up. The menu advertised to us was not the menu we got upon their arrival. Half of the items were not there, such as the wings. Prices were higher than was advertised to us as well. When I ordered a side of mango I was told \"we only have one mango on the truck\" which is bizarre because the first word of their name is MANGO. I didn't know how to interpret that response but she let me order anyway. I waited 50 mins in the blistering sun for this 16.94 order of a mango pesto flatbread and side of mango. The side salad was limp and disgusting. The flatbread was horrible. No pesto sauce. So oily and the cheese was so stinky... I couldn't eat it. My side of mango couldn't fill my palm. I was so angry and so hungry after ordering. I will never spend my money with them again. Also, I emailed them to tell them my issues last week and still have not heard a response. So I thought the public should know."}
{"text":"The food truck was at our office today I decided on the mango salad. While the salad was ok the portion left much to be desired especially for the $7 price and in fact not all items as advertised were on the salad. I'm not expecting much but this was not good on top of the 20 min wait to get it. Felt sorry for those who ordered hot food the two other people waiting ahead of me were still waiting when I left and from my understanding they had been there for 40 minutes when I left   Definitely don't waste your time on this one."}
{"text":"I attended the round up Food truck event this past Saturday my family and I purchased mac and cheese from another truck and it was good until we had Mango Flatz Literally blew everything out the water. I watched my brother throw away some mac and cheese from another vendor because he refused to eat it lol we had a blast Customer service was fantastic keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"This food is amazing!! Mango flats are superb. The mango salsa is heavenly!! Food was hot, fresh and fast!! I am not a salad eater, but they have a strawberry vinaigrette dressing that has definitely changed my palate. Kudos to the new management!!"}
{"text":"Seriously unprepared for a crowd, waited 30mins for limp pile of fries and the skinniest Stromboli ever. Their generator is so loud u can't hear the guy in the window, real mess. The flatbread my friend ordered was cold and the cheese was only half melted."}
{"text":"This food truck came to our apartment community and needless to say it was well priced and the flatbreads were great! I had the mango chicken pesto flatbread with the side salad  Thank you Mango Flats."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw chicken pho on the menu. Even though today was a hot one, I've been sick so I welcomed some hot soup. They were the only truck at my work place and there was a line (expected during lunch rush hour). My brother waited close to what seemed like a half hour. I, fortunately didn't have to wait as long. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. There was barely any noodles, the broth was bland and it was nothing like any pho I've ever had. They should change the name because it is far from pho. The chicken was flavorful and the person who took the order was sweet. Also, I was told my order was $8 but was charged $9.04. Meanwhile, the guy before me gave the exact $10 that he was told he owed. C'mon, at least disclose that you're going to charge a service fee for using a card. There's no way in hell it was $1.04 for taxes."}
{"text":"First time I tried them, they had some amazing hot apple cider! I believe it's a seasonal menu item but it was like the most amazing apple pie you've ever had converted in to a warming, soothing drink. I always get a different type of  chicken flatbread. Super tasty and cooked to perfection. Yum!"}
