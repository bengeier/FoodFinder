{"text":"This place seems to have potential, but whoever owns it seems to have ADD.  They have posters of 'home made' spring rolls as an appetizer, which may go good with the meatloaf/potato pancake 'lasagna' that they have on the menu.  Or perhaps a margarita would go good with a gyro?  Speaking of which, despite the novella size of the menu, it makes no mention (that I saw) of the liquor offerings of what I guess is a beer/wine license that they have; the only mention is a hand written sign half hidden in the front, and so it goes.

I ordered the salmon and it had an herb butter on it which was nice, but the fish itself had no flavor (I'd call it frozen, but I've had better frozen salmon).  Their ever present selection of heated-up frozen veggies that come with their dinners are little bit of a puzzlement as they taste awful, and making the same thing from fresh would cost about a third as much.  Maybe they have to keep the flavor dialed back so that they do not alienate their core customers to whom the word 'Yelp' is something their cat Mittens does when they step on it's tail because they can't see him without their glasses.

Anyway, the service was friendly and prompt, the salad bar is OK, and the food for all it's faults was hot and inoffensive (really, where else can you get a $10 salmon dinner).  Still, the place would do itself a favor if it were to choose some core competencies (you can make good stir fry AND good fajitas?  Right.) so that their limited menu could be more fresh and flavorful.

(As an update, the 'food posters' are gone, and I'm happy to report that the gyro meat breakfast was one of the best gyro breakfasts that I've had.  It had big chunks of juicy gyro meat instead of the thin, dried sheets that I've gotten at other locations)."}
{"text":"Not the greatest food, but for $5, you get what you paid for.  I would write more, but the picture of my meatloaf should be worth 1000 words which is approximately equal to one Swanson dinner or two dollars."}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars because I've not yet dined in; however, the take out was really closer to 3 stars for me. We got a random selection of blueberry French toast with eggs, bacon and sausage, potato skins, strawberry cheesecake and baklava. 
The French toast meal was okay. Everything was a bit over cooked, but it wasn't really bad. I did not eat the scrambled eggs because they were dry. 
The potato skins were dry and a bit bland. I'd recommend just seasoning the actual potato and cooking them for a shorter time. 
Strawberry cheesecake was AMAZING. I was very glad I got it. The baklava was slightly dry and bland but overall not horrible. They did a great job with the layers and flakiness. 
Overall, the quality wasn't the best I've ever had (a bit plain, but they're *so* close), but the prices were reasonable, so I'd probably go back in the future. It wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't awful. Just a bit average."}
{"text":"I was dragged here, kicking and screaming, on a business trip where we didn't have time to look for a decent restaurant and instead just stopped at the first place we came to.  All the warning signs of a bad restaurant were there: almost empty parking lot, faded and badly designed outside banner with bad pictures of some of their menu items, no one at the front of the restaurant ready to seat us, an almost empty restaurant, the 3 couples seated and eating were all 80+ years old, a poorly maintained lunch buffet with nothing in it that looked appealing, and the menu itself was huge (8+ pages). 

If I'd of had any choice here, I would have ran out the door and sped off.  But instead, I went through the ordeal of having to read through their enormous menu and try to find something to my liking. I didn't have time to go into detail, and since I'd seen many mentions, as well as pictures, of their ribs, I ordered a full stack of ribs thinking it may be something they specialized in or at the very least thought they were proud of. So I quickly ordered the full stack of ribs and let the waitress know I was in a hurry to catch a flight. I tried to really emphasize I was in a big hurry. 

As I waited, I went to the salad/soup bar for something to hold me over. There was nothing in salad that looked good at all, so I took a bowl of some broccoli cream soup, that was decent, but obviously canned - and I easily deduced this from the chunks of not fully mixed condensed soup.  Then, I came back to the table with the soup, the waitress asked if I would like to have my food order held while I ate my soup/salad... No, I want my food as soon as possible, did I not make that clear?

When my ribs finally came, I was extremely annoyed.  It had to have been about 30 min... so much for being quick.  Then, first bite into the ribs, and I realized I'd made a mistake in the order, as they were over-cooked, dry, about as tough as beef jerky, and under-seasoned.  Oh, and I asked for no gravy on my mashed potatoes, and it came covered in gravy.

Horrible experience.  I'd of rather had fast food."}
{"text":"I visited here with my boyfriend again this morning for breakfast. We decided to bring a coupon along with us that stated that if we purchased $20.00 or more, the coupon would knock $10.00 off. Half off. Great deal. The exclusions on the coupon only specified tax. So, as the coupon stated, 1. two people, 2. two drinks 2. two regular menu items. So, we each ordered a drink, a meal, and ordered side dishes that we normally wouldn't have ordered in order to fill the qualifications on the coupon, and get the deal. Our bill (tax and tip excluded) was slightly over $20.00. Thus, we thought, our coupon was acceptable. The manager at the front tried to explain to us why we didn't qualify for the coupon, of which my boyfriend or I didn't fully understand why. So, in order to avoid argument, we just said \"Okay.\" and paid for the full price of the meal. Perhaps the coupon meant only $20.00 worth of two entrees (regular meal items?); however, there isn't anything for breakfast enough to equal the amount of $20.00 on it's own if paired up between two people. In any regard, the coupon was very misleading and written improperly if that is the case. There wasn't any specifications on the coupon that we didn't follow when ordering our meal. Being a regular here (my boyfriend and I come here on average approximately 3 times a month, and left a previous yelp review on the experience), but our experience today left a bad taste in both of our mouths. Sorry, Jordan's. I like your guys food, and the service is usually great, but I don't think either of us will be coming back."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant in the 90's with my husband because he liked salad bars.  This was our first visit in 20 years...no husband now!  There were many walkers in the place - the average customer age was probably 80 not counting my son and myself.  Ironically, though, the music consisted of Meghan Trainer, Nick Jonas, and Iggy Azalea, etc.-LOL!  We had an Entertainment coupon and asked about any restrictions.  The waitress pointed to the fish special and a few others.  I got the gyro platter which tasted good like any gyro I've eaten anywhere.  My son got a chicken breast covered with cheese and mushrooms.  It had no seasoning at all.  Most of the salad ingredients were fresh and the clam chowder was good as I remembered.  However, my son tasted potato salad and pasta salad that he described as \"nasty\".  Service was good and friendly.  However, when we went to the register another woman tried to tell us we couldn't use the coupon because it was one of the \"specials\".  When I persisted, she said our waitress would have to ring us up then.  The food is good for old people on low salt diets, but it's funny how the music doesn't match the clientele."}
{"text":"Food was cold, service was slow and the place wasn't even that busy- I do not blame the waitress since she was apologetic and sincere. The toast was literally dripping in butter. $31 for breakfast for two people at a family diner seemed a little steep to me. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Honestly ruined my morning. Ordered a croissant sandwich add sausage patty and two piece bacon. Pepper jack cheese and **eggs on side please .

What do I get ? The sausage cut up mixed in the eggs that are on the side and the cheese on top --.  
Eggs on side means eggs on side 
Not everything on the side and mixed in eggs clearly If you order the eggs on side it means only the eggs.  

Won't order ever again - so glad my dog can't even the eggs bec the pepper jack cheese melted in them  I knew I should've just made breakfast today.

Yes I'm hangry - 

I went to take a bite of my boyfriends pancake since my breakfast was no longer an option to eat - and it seems the grill top must have been dirty bec the pancakes Are blackened and taste off - and the hash had been all burnt up too."}
{"text":"So we've ordered delivery 3 times and every time something was forgotten. Not sure if that's on the service or the restaurant. Food was a mess every time it was received, but that is definitely on the service.

Of the food that's been ordered:

Tuna salad sandwich was ok. Nothing to set it apart from what I can make at home.
Perch dinner was ok as well. 
Walleye dinner was very good. Two giant pieces and fried well.
Open face turkey dinner was also very good. Lots of real turkey goodness there!
Bacon cheeseburger was good, but the specified temp was missed (expected that though).

Two best things ordered:
Meatloaf dinner and the Jordan's combo pancake. Definitely would get either again. Meatloaf was not dry, generous portion, and savory. All the breakfast items were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"15 bucks for breakfast for me and the wifey, good food but lousy service. Seems like every time I have been here the last few years it is slowly getting worse."}
{"text":"Loved the Beef stroganoff. Meat was very tender and oh so delicious. My friend had the Extra Burger. He said it was a very good burger. It was cooked a little more than he would have liked it but the server informed us to ask for it medium the next time. I will definitely be making a return trip in the future."}
{"text":"I really love their corned beef latkas and gyro platter. They make the latka mix from scratch and you can't beat that. Hubby always gets the monte cristo and inhales it every time. And the soups are always the best when you're feeling the Cleveland cold, I love the cream of broccoli! It's a cute little spot for a quick bite any time of day."}
{"text":"It's got some good things but they don't outweigh the negatives. The waitress we had was absolutely wonderful. Very nice and fun. I got the gyro platter which was OK, my mom got the liver & onions which she said was great.  They have a salad bar that wasn't exciting. The salad bar had full size carrots and full radishes, they don't slice of shred any of the vegetable toppings. 4 different soups but none of them had any flavor. Only four other people in the restaurant. They only had 2 vegetable sides to go with meals, corn or green beans both of which were out of a can."}
