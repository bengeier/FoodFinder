{"text":"Tucked inside times square, plaza, it is a totally different vibe when you walk into this cafe. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food.   Food: Had the cold iron goddess steeped tea. It was a nice crisp taste but a bit pricy. I'd rather try their other more unique drinks in the future.   Ordered the short rib donburi which was really good in terms of taste and texture. It paired well with rice and the tender ribs made the rice flavourful too.   The kimchi seafood paella was a disappointment. Although it sounded like a good pairing, it was more spicy than kimchi taste. Also, the choice of rice is not the kind usually used for paella so the overall texture was weird.   The iron goddess soft serve ice cream was good and refreshing. It is free during the soft opening if you check in on Facebook or Instagram.   Atmosphere: Very comfortable seating and environment. Great to hang out with friends or for a date."}

{"text":"$26 Paella with frozen shrimps and SPAM.   Decor 4*, Food 2*, Value 2*, Service 3*  Go again? Absolutely not. Ppl go there to take pictures and what not, decor is nice, but not out of the world. Food is definitely underwhelming and very overprice for what it is.   Food has nice presentation, but I feel that the ingredient is very low quality. Again, Chunks of SPAMS.. they could have came up with better fillers..."}
{"text":"Ordered pancakes never arrived after 30 minutes.  Subsequent orders filled with other customers while our order was missed."}
{"text":"This new cafe opened up a month ago at Times Square. We came here around 9 PM on a Saturday evening and had to wait to get a seat even though we were seated quite quickly. The kitchen closes at 10 PM so the server asked us if we were ordering any hot food or just dessert.   My impression of this place was high end... but the quality of the food just wasn't worth the price you were paying for. The desserts and drinks were around $8 each. Food was even more. This place really adds up even if you're only here for desserts. I ordered the mango mousse which came with a side of ice cream ($8). The mango mousse was like a dome perhaps 3\" in diameter and the ice cream was in a dipper small plastic container with a few berries. The food came out literally within 5 mins after ordering... I had a feeling that the food was already pre-plated as the restaurant was super busy. For that price, I wouldn't come back. The food wasn't super fresh and/or impressive. I would rather spend that money on another dessert place or even bubble tea."}
{"text":"Great location and food! The interior of the restaurant is amazing and very modern. On Google it says the restaurant opens at 12PM so I arrived at 12:10PM, and all the good photogenic spots were already gone from the restaurant! I would say the best spots available would be the window seats. Be sure to arrive early in oder to get a spot for pictures if that's what you're looking for.   I ordered the 48H Short Rib Donburi ($21.00, they raised the price from the grand opening) and the Original Souffle Pancakes ($13.00). Accidentally ate the Short Rib Donburi before I could take a picture because I was too hungry (oops). I have never had the souffle pancakes before, and this one was nice and fluffy. The tea flavoured ice cream pairs well with the pancakes, however I can see how some people who prefer really sweet desserts would not enjoy this as it is light and more bland.   After some time in the restaurant I had asked the waiter if we could move closer to the window if a spot freed up, and the gladly helped us move our tea to that spot. There was also never once I had to ask someone to refill our waters as they came up every few minutes to top off our glasses. Great service overall and I would recommend this highly!"}
{"text":"I came here on Tuesday night around 7:30 and got seated very quickly.   Cute spot to hang out with friends! Modern and chic decor.   Food quality: -2.5/5 for soufflé pancake: decent flavour and the texture was not up to expectations.  -4/5 for the short rib donburi -3/5 for our drinks (iced matcha latte and sparkling lychee capis.   Service: 3/5 Attentive and polite mostly. Different servers came to check on us wayyy to often even though we did not stay for too long (less than 2 hours)."}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant from my friends and wanted to give it a try. The waitresses are friendly and the service is good. They always drop and check with me if everything is alright. They are doing a promotion now that if you like their page on Facebook or on Instagram. You can get 10% off with a free ice cream as well. I came with my husband and we ordered a bottle of Tishan tea. We actually attempted to order several different kinds of tea, the waitress kept running back and said they were out of stocks. Finally, there's one for us. It tastes like green tea to me. For dinner, I ordered an order of Crab Cake and an order of short rib.  Short Ribs (4/5) The short ribs taste good. It's well marinated and the middle is pink. The chef did a good job in cooking the ribs. The ginger on top of the ribs is refreshing. But the teriyaki sauce is a bit sweet and the sauce on the rice did make the rice sweet and soggy.   Crab Cake with Crispy Potatoes (3.5/5) The potatoes are crispy but there's no taste. The crab cake is alright. I like the avocado sauce on top of the crab cake. The crab cake tastes alright, it's not too bad. Fresh m time to time, I need to remove the crab shell that's found in the crab cake. The slice of bread underneath the crab cake is a bit too hard.  At last, I got a complimentary ice cream by liking their page on Facebook"}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5/5.0  Went here on a weekend afternoon to check out their soft opening. At the time, they were only serving desserts and drinks. The interior is definitely done very nicely with a similar vibe to a downtown cafe. I really wanted to like this place but none of the things I got impressed me.  Below are a few items that we ordered:  Soufflé Pancake (2.0/5.0) - Failed the jiggle test and  the inside tasted like undercooked batter. There was a very prominent egg white aroma but not much else, which comes off as being quite bland.   Flat White (1.0/5.0) - At $5.00 for a flat white, it is about $0.50-$1.00 more than any other reputable cafe downtown with well trained and experienced baristas. The milk temperature was too hot which causes the milk to lose its sweetness. Although the latte art was successfully made, the texture was of the milk was way too thin.   Mango Mousse Dome (3.0/5.0) - Nothing really to write home about this dessert. Imagine a similar tart that you would get at a higher end Asian bakery, plated with a few strips of fruits -- that is essentially what you are getting.  Black Sesame Roll (1.5/5.0) - It had a nice black sesame flavour but the cake itself was super dense and dry. The outer layer was cracking as well because it was so dry.   All desserts came with an earl grey soft serve. You can also get a free iron goddess soft serve and 10% off your bill if you follow or like their social media page. The soft serve texture was done very well and the tea flavour really came through. One feedback I have as an improvement point is the after taste of the soft serve. Am not sure if they used some sort of low calorie sweetener as it had that kind of after taste.  Although the waitresses seemed quite junior, they were genuinely helpful, polite and attentive which I appreciate.  I will come back again to try their main course selection as I have heard better things about their short rib donburi."}
{"text":"My squad and I visited this restaurant for the first time on Thursday night. We all thought that the environment and decor was very fitting for a girl's night out. If you don't look outside into the Times Square parking lot, you'd think you're dining downtown. Ambient lighting, well thought out interior design with sophisticated gold accents around the space. I give the environment a score of 4/5.  I called during the day to make a reservation for that evening but was told that they only allow walk-ins. And the staff whom I spoke to wasn't able to tell me whether or not they'd be busy in the evening either. So we thought we'd try our our luck. The place wasn't packed but almost all tables were occupied. We got seated at the booth off to the side which could accommodate all 5 of us comfortably.   Service: I felt that the staff were a bit inexperienced in a few areas and could need some training. When some of our girls arrived to the seat, the staff promptly approached us to see if we were ready to order. It would be nice if they could allow us to spend some time to settle in and take a look at their menu first. That happened twice. When we placed our orders for dinner, the staff told us we could keep the dessert menu so we could take a look at the dessert. This wasn't a big deal but as an upscale restaurant,  this step happens after when dinners are done and not while waiting for dinner to arrive. Staff were all very friendly and approachable. Although a few didn't seem like they could speak English, so communicating required some patience. When we asked to split our bills, it got a bit complicated and took a while before our server could get it right. She didn't manage to separate our meals onto different receipts but she took the effort to help us calculate the amount per person while splitting for a shared item. So, overall, I thought the service was good just lacking some experience, which was understandable since they were quite new. 3.5/5  Food: The 48 hr short ribs donburi was tasty. The ribs were well marinated and super tender. The spicy drunken chicken was very crispy and had a nice kick to it but there were only 4 pieces. Their souffle pancakes were very fluffy, and light in texture. I've never had souffle pancakes this soft before so it felt like I didn't even put anything in my belly. The souffle pancakes also came with a cup of their house made Iron Goddess soft serve. It was delicious! The nuts were a nice added touch. Overall, I thought the food was decent but the portion was a bit small. It might be tough to fill up a grown man but for ladies' night, it was fine 3.5/5  We got a 10% discount and free iron Goddess soft serve during their soft opening :)"}
{"text":"Went there during a weekend, the place filled out pretty quickly. My suggestion, is to go early or make reservation. The restaurant is nicely renovated, you feel comfortable with the set up and seating. We ordered 3 plates - the crab cake, 48H ribs and chicken sandwich. The crab cake is rich in flavours, it is the best dish out of the 3. The 48H is very tender and juicy but it lacks the side. Seems like they only give you a few pieces of meat on top of a bowl of rice. I wish they could throw in more stuff (the food presentation). Chicken sandwich lacks flavour, it has no taste other than the burning smell from the bbq stove top and the meat was a little rough but the veggies and side crispy potato was not bad. Overall, only 1/3 dish gave me a wow effect and also I came for the 10% off for soft opening and the free ice-cream.  Hope they will improve along"}
{"text":"In short, about 3.5 stars. This place looks new, fancy, and clean. After trying a few menu items, this place sort of like the premium brand of Ten Ren related kind of cafe which their focus is to provide even more quality of food and tea/coffee.  This is just my perception of things... may or may not reflect the owner's vision :). Regardless, this restaurant is definitely a good addition to the neighbourhood.   Tried three items  1. The baby gem salad - 3 stars - acceptable quality and comparable to what you expect from other restaurant. But one comment though if food quality is their focus from the pricing, some lettuce pieces in the salad has some light brown edges which may indicate it's been cut for some time. Not a big deal but it's the details that makes the difference sometimes. The plating  presentation is pretty though.  2. 48 hrs short ribs donburi - 3.5 stars - the presentation is neat but for $18, it should be. The short rib is very soft and tender. But besides that, nothing else stand out to me. Maybe it's me, I find most of the taste from this dish is coming from the sauce that taste abit like Teriyaki sauce. And sort of lacks the beef flavour that i would expect even from the actual meat pieces itself.   3. Organic Berry and Apple tea hope I remember it correctly. :). - close to 4 stars. Good that they are offering organic tea item! Thumbs up! The whole set sure is a pretty looking tea. And taste soothing after the food. But not cheap either, maybe it's because organic...   The service staff is friendly and the waitress took care of us always has a smile on her face! A big plus.   Overall it's a positive experience and I would come again. But probably not often due to the higher pricing for me. Worth a try if u haven't !"}
{"text":"Not going to sugar coat this at all. All honesty they have a lot of room to improve as this is just there soft opening. However the only reason why I would rate this as low as it is, is due to several factors that really need to improve on.  Food: We ordered a variety of things on the menu. First off the drunken chicken, we got it in both the mild and the spicy version. Was definitely not a fan of the the mild version as nothing really stood out from the dish. I do however thought it was cooked well as the chicken was not dry.   Arancini takoyaki was definitely the major highlight of this evening as a really enjoyed every aspect of this particular dish. Using risotto was definitely something I didn't expect and it paid off well.  Crab cake tostada was pretty good in terms of flavoring, however felt that the dish itself was overpriced.  48 hour Short Rib Donburi was pretty good. I wouldn't pay that much for any Donburi type dishes normally but I would say I had no grip with anything on this dish. The short rib was tender and the jus from the short rib was good.  Kimchi seafood paella was the most underwelming dish of the night. From the looks of it I expected something with a bit of spice and kick to the dish, sadly it was bland and undesirable. My friend also found a mussel that definitely smelled rancid, however we just kicked it to the side and moved on to dessert.  Finally, the reason why I came in to the restaurant in the first place, Souffle Pancake. As one of the few people experimenting with the craze, I had to see what the hype is. Definitely was below expectations but I definitely found the dish good. The ice cream that comes on the side was also good.   Service: Again I know it's soft opening so you will find kinks... But really as a place to be considered upscale, you really need better service then this. A cafe/restaurant that seats about 30 In capacity and your servers are just standing around is unacceptable.   The bar of standards should be set higher if your trying to have that quality standard and at the moment it's just not there. I shouldn't be waiting for water top ups and quality checking happens just at the end of finishing the dish when I can clearly see the servers just standing around.   Although the servers seem friendly enough, clearly there is a lot of inexperience and I'm writing this mainly due to hoping things improve.  Ambiance: Bit too bright, nice decor, definitely have that cafe vibe down.  Overall verdict, I can see this place doing well, food is decent and there is definitely a lot of creativity and work behind the BOH team. Food was presented excellently and while some dishes are a hit or miss, I definitely think it what standing out for them. What suffers ultimately is the FOH team as it's comes off more like your typical run of the mill Go For Tea then it is a upscale dining experience. Definitely not opposed to recommending them to other people, but I will say let's set higher standards for them to grow."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5. I only tried the drinks and pancake soo my review is based on that. First of all, the decor is really nice and fancy, I really liked the cutlery, ambiance and interior. The design is well thought out and the presentation is beautiful. I know they just opened, but the service felt a bit awkward and the staff seemed inexperienced and some were just standing around awkwardly. Even though we were sitting so close to them they couldn't see/hear us while we waved their attention. Another thing that reduced points for me was that they served no water when we sat down.   For the food - I shared a pancake and got a tea. Everything here is priced on the high side so my expectations would be higher- goes for service as well. The pancake was pretty good and very soft, the ice cream they served with it had a really subtle and nice tea flavor. Presentation was very nice and thought out. My tea was $8 and for that price, it didn't feel justified. I think $5 would've been more reasonable for a green tea.   The food and presentation of everything looked very nice, I think if the staff was in training for a bit longer, this place would definitely be a 4. I would come back to try their food, but it would definitely be a special occasion type of thing."}
{"text":"I like this place. I think it is a good addition to the area. Food is reasonably priced. But the beverage is too expensive, in my opinion. They said they use high quality tea but I don't think I know how to appreciate it enough to be willing to pay a higher price for it.  Service people are all very nice but the service is not professional yet. It may take some effort to get their attention. Extra utensils were not offered even they knew we were sharing the food. Sugar was not provided with coffee until we asked for it.  Some food are very good and some are just okay. But they need to work on two areas: - The quality of the food is not consistent: for example: The soufflé pancake is very good when it is made properly but when not, it was like eating scramble egg. The crab cake tostada was delicious but some are more deep-fried (a lot darker color) than the other. - Hot food should be served hot. I understand they want to serve all entrees to the table at the same time but they should have prepared the food in a better order. Our steak wasn't served warm enough.  I like the kimchi seafood paella. I didn't taste the kimchi at all but I think this dish has a well balance of ingredients (except the spam that I don't like). It's tasty. The 48hr shot rib was very tender.  The steak sandwich was a good value dish with real steak in them. I like the veggie they put in the sandwich.  I wasn't impressed by the kale salad, the crispy potatoes and the sesame roll cake. They were okay but nothing special.   I will go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Tried this newly open cafe. Interior was nice, and everything looked aesthetically pleasing (the tableware, the decor, etc). But food was disappointing.  We ordered the 48H short rib donburi, kimchi seafood paella and the souffle pancakes.   The short rib donburi was flavourful but small. It was also a little on the saltier side due to the sauce (they should use less sauce so you can taste the flavour of the rib, instead of over powering it.   We didn't like the kimchi seafood paella. It was a big disappointment, but I guess since it's kind of an Asian fusion place, what would you expect? It wasn't super flavourful either. There were too much red peppers in it (ours was 60% peppers), and it would have been better if they cut the slices into smaller pieces. They also used spam in the paella, which I didnt think it \"fit\" the dish well. You also don't really taste the kimchi.   The souffle pancakes were disappointing as well. It was \"fluffy\" when you first put it into your mouth, but then it gets mushy really quickly. It was also a little bland. But the tea ice cream that it came with was really good.   Overall, I'll go back only if they serve their soft serve as a menu option."}
{"text":"Came here today with a group of my friends. First, the decor of this cafe is beautiful. Everything is so clean and modern which makes everything so photogenic. We ordered a couple dishes and shared just so we can try everything. Out of all the dishes the mushroom toast is actually my favourite. The flavours of the mushrooms are really strong and all the ingredients works very well together. The reason I only gave the Cafe 3 stars is because we also tried the kimchi paella and it's SO expensive considering they use spam as one of the meats in the rice. And I know that they're doing a asian take on paella but cooking paella on a iron skillet is what really makes dish stand out. We also tried the original soufflé pancake. I've had soufflé pancake when I was in Japan before so I do feel like it's not fair to compare, but the \"pancake\" here has absolutely no taste but egg. It just taste like fluffy egg. The drinks are def delicious, the ice mocha and matcha latte was a delight but still way to expensive for  $7. Beautiful cafe though."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews for restaurants but this place is AWESOME!!! All the dishes we ordered were delicious but short rib donburi and souffle pancakes are out of this world. If you like coffee, don't miss the espresso rock with milk, either! We were super impressed with the food, service and ambience. We will definitely come back again for more!"}
{"text":"Wish to give this place a proper review; however, upon arriving at 9:02pm we were told to leave even though the cafe closes at 10pm.  Really?!? Who does their last call one whole hour before closing..... and we were only 2 mins after 9pm!   Wish our party knew about this beforehand! We trekked all the way from midtown to try this new hip restaurant.    Ah well... c'est la vie!"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for new concept restaurants, and my favourite is asian fusion.  This place popped up on my nearby HOT and NEW restaurants and I just had to try it out!  (Food:) CRAB CAKE TOSTADA: I will start off with the one I liked the least.  Although the avocado crema was on point, I find that I don't particularly like crab cakes.  The salad they put on the side was pretty tasty (and they do quite a good candied walnut), but the price point is far too steep for such a dish.  48H SHORT RIB DONBURI: was divine.  Restaurants nowadays are really getting into the whole sous-vide deal, and honestly I can see why.  Sous-vide allows the short rib to be cooked medium-rare while keeping the meat tender and moist.  It was a delicious dish.  And finally the crème de la crème; the SOUFFLE PANCAKES seem to be the signature dessert here and did they taste heavenly? Yes they did.  Although with an extra 15-20 minute wait time, the pancakes reminded me of Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake but with a stickier and thicker consistency.  They were plated very nicely and came with a side of Iron Goddess soft serve.  This Iron Goddess soft serve was also part of their promotional soft-opening deal, where they gave everyone a free serving of their house-made ice cream.  It was so good! It tasted like a flavour of bubble tea, but in an ice-cream version.   (Price:) CRAB CAKE TOSTADA: $19  48H SHORT RIB DONBURI: $18  SOUFFLE PANCAKES: $14  IRON GODDESS SOFT SERVE: Free!  Extra 10% off for soft opening! (If you follow on social media)   (Ambience:) Walking in, you feel like you stepped in a restaurant that is better suited as one downtown.  The decor is clean and simple, with gold embellishments and succulents lining the table.  They even serve tea in wine glasses!  I am not fancy enough for this place!  (Overall:) I liked it!  I would come again just for the souffle pancakes! And hopefully, they'll have a grand opening, with more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Enticed by the soft opening 10% off & ice cream promotions, we decided to check out Cafe Bon Bon for their drunken fried chicken and soufflé pancakes. Even from the outside, I was immediately enamoured by the modern and inviting decor. I really liked the feel of the restaurant, with the spacious & clean interior and acoustic covers playing in the background.  I thought that everything we ate was delicious. The drunken fried chicken was crispy and, although I don't have a point of comparison for the pancakes, they were pretty much what I expected. The soft serve ice cream that came with the social media promotion was also flavourful and lovely.  I can understand other Yelpers' concerns re: price as I don't think I would get the soufflé pancakes again for the price. However, I think that our visit as it was, with the 10% off and ice cream promotion, was a 5 star experience. As long as Cafe Bon Bon continues such attentive & friendly service and unique dishes, I would be back to get the drunken fried chicken again and try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"A very modern environment paired with good service and even better food. You can go here for just dessert or a full meal. They have a wide selection of food, dessert and drinks. Everything is very well presented, the latte art is beautiful and the food plating looks artistic and on point. I had the short rib donburi, if you appreciate the fattier meats, this was delicious. I also had the soufflé pancakes which were pretty bouncy. For how nice the restaurant physically is and how fancy the food is, price point is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Went to their soft opening. Their servers were very attentive and helpful. We ordered the seafood paella and it was a little too salty for us. The rice was a nice texture and lots of seafood inside. We had the soufflé pancake. It was fluffy and full of egg flavour. The ice cream was delicious as well. Nice place and great service."}
{"text":"Amazing pancake! We ordered the one w chocolate. It wasn't undercooked like the other reviews I read before going. Went there on a weekday around 2 and it was already packed. Love the iron goddess ice cream!! Also I would like to compliment on their water which they added fruits in it unlike the other places where they just add a piece of lemon but tastes stale. Will def go again!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Bon Bon recently opened in the Times Square Plaza, where the old Vietnamese restaurant used to be. They did an amazing job renovating the place, with a beautiful open-concept kitchen design! The interior design is very modern looking, seating is comfortable and roomy, and the overall atmosphere is that of an upscale cafe. They poured a lot of money into this place! All the washrooms are individual, gender-neutral stalls that even the selfie-queen Trudeau would approve of!   Now on to the food. The menu isn't very cohesive, so I can't say what type of cuisine they specialize in. They have everything from sandwiches to pasta to rice bowls, most of which are Asian-inspired. I'm generally not a huge fan of fusion-type cuisine. Sometimes it works and tastes delicious, but often, the elements don't compliment each other and result in fusion-confusion.   For example, the Arancini Takoyaki is creative, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. Classic Italian Arancini and simple Japanese Takoyaki are both delicious, but when mashed together, it becomes octopus in a mushy rice ball. The bonito flakes go well with the traditional tonkatsu sauce, not romesco sauce!   Another example is the drunken fried chicken. Why use puffed rice as breading when after frying it becomes rock hard? The chicken is super tender after being brined in rice wine, and the tangy s&s sauce is awesome. Had you stayed with regular karage batter with a crispy outer coating, this would have been a knockout dish, but the hard puffed rice shell just doesn't work in my opinion.   The Kimchi Seafood Paella tries to put a Korean twist on a Spanish classic. The Kimchi flavor was light enough that it didn't overpower and mask the fresh seafood. But why use sushi rice for a paella? I think if this were a creamier risotto type dish, the short grain sushi rice would have been a reasonable substitute for Arborio rice. However with a Paella, a traditional Bomba rice would have been a much better choice as it will absorb a lot of liquid to get the flavors but still retain its starch to naturally stay more al dente. Undercooking sushi rice to try and mimic that same desired firm texture results in a more gritty core and since less liquid is absorbed, you get less flavorful rice. I still enjoyed this dish, but personally I think had they stuck with traditional Bomba rice and used a lighter saffron butter sauce instead of making it kimchi-based, this dish could have been even better.   Now on to the dishes that were really good.   The Thai crab cakes were light, plenty of crab meat, and had a nice base. The avocado crema complimented the crab cake beautifully. The vinegarette on the salad was light and balanced.   The 48hr short rib donburi was a stellar knockout dish. The sous vide technique cooked the marbled short rib perfectly, making it melt in your mouth. All components of the dish from the enoki, scallion, shoga, Japanese rice, and sauce compliments each other harmoniously. Had the chef tried to fusion-ize this dish with some tikka-masala sauce or cheese-whiz, it just wouldn't have been so good. Keep it simple, sometimes less is more! This was an amazing dish that I would totally order regularly. If there is one must-try dish here, this is it!   Finally, the soufflé pancake was a great way to end the meal. Light fluffy egg-whites made the pancake so light and airy. This was the first time I've had these, and it definitely won't be my last. Another stellar dish that is definitely worth trying.   Now on to the service. This is still a newly opened restaurant, so the servers are still understandably inexperienced. They don't know the menu well enough to be able to help with the ordering. There are far too many servers just standing around with nothing to do that they come by to take away the plates even before we are finished cleaning off the plates. Interestingly, they completely ignored my empty water glass and I had to specifically ask for a refill. Some further training definitely needed.   The price of the dishes I find is quite reasonable for what you get. With the exception of the drinks, costing between $7 and $11. Apparently, the teas are high-grade imports from Taiwan, but I really don't feel like paying $10 for a drink. They should add slightly cheaper options to the menu for more selection. Why not offer some regular bubble tea or at least some form of basic milk tea?   Overall, I think this restaurant has lots of potential. After some improvements to the menu and better staff training, this could become a really great cafe. Will definitely consider coming back to try some of the other dishes. Just don't get creative and change that 48 hr short rib donburi because it's perfect just the way it is!"}
{"text":"Worst dessert place we ever went! We ordered the most popular one from their menu- Pancakes. And we sit there waited for almost a hour. We did not realize something went wrong until the couple sit bedside us they submit the order later then us but get the pancake less then 20 minutes.   We called the waitress to help us follow up. And the staff from the kitchen told the waitress they skipped our order.....we over heard it because we sit really close to the kitchen area.   When the waitress came back to us she said only needs to have 5 more minutes. And I told her I need a credit for the time we lost. She went to talked to her manager or the owner of this cafe shop, and she came back to tell us they can give this pancake for free to us but we need to wait for another 49 minutes due to high ordering volume.  If you think you have a special pancake so you can show careless about what the costumers' feelings, I am telling you this is the wrong way to treat the costumer like that especially you work in the costumer service industry by handling the issue like this!    Do not randomly promise the costumer something and told costumer another new story right after!   The entire store shows zero care about costumer's feeling at all!   Do you understand customers come to your store just want to spend the time to relax and enjoy the food! Instead of go to your store and deal those drama!   The store attitude is more like what people usually get at the traditional Hong Kong Cafe!  Very disappointed! If the excuse is the store is still in soft opening then the store should be more dedicated to solve this issue at the spot!     Plus  we also order the traditional tea in the pot, but we found out there is not single tea leave in the pot! And this little pot of tea cost almost $11 with tax!  We would never go there again based the what we experienced!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly staff. And the wait time is accurate (i.e. If they told you 15 mins then it's 15 mins' wait, and if they told you 1 hour, then it's 1 hour). There's a Chinese dessert place near the entrance of the plaza to hang out during the wait. Is usually leave if the wait is longer than 15 mins, but the first time I actually waited for 1 hour since we were with friends, and I think it worth it.  I was really impressed by the 48 hours donburi we order one for each cuz I don't wanna share lol! Drunken chicken and Wild mushroom toast are good. Pancakes are okay, not a big fan but willing to try the chocolate flavor next time.  Second visit I felt the donburi is a bit too sweet to my liking---so the pickled gingers on top is not necessary lol. I think thin-sliced Chinese style pickled mini cucumber might help balancing the flavor?   Chocolate lava cake, yum.  Drunken chicken, nice but again too sweet. Paella, meh"}
{"text":"This place looked very classy, when they showed me to my table I was shocked how they pulled out the chair for me. The way that they placed the menu was really nice, but it didn't make sense to me. I have two parties so there were two sets of menus, what didn't make sense to me was what's the point for fanning out both sets infront of me...  I was waiting for my friend so I had ordered myself a hot fruit tea. When it came I was quite happy with it, the pot and the cup looked really cute. Then there was that cookie... they placed it on my table and did not tell me what it was.. what if I have allergies. I don't but still. After asking one of the waiters it took a couples of trial before he figures out what it is. I know it's a cookie but what kind.. what I want to know is what's in it and what's the flavour is it that hard... finally I decided to pour a cup of tea and the handle was soaking wet that I got napkins start soaking that water. The napkin has imprints of the wet handle.. maybe they should consider not to put the handles in the wash. At last my first sip of the fruit tea, OMG this tea is so bitter that all I can taste is orange zest. Where's the \"TEA\"!!??!!??!! This isn't have called the fruit tea when it's gonna taste like boiled oranges. I've requested for some honey so let's see if this will make a difference... is it too much to ask if you give me honey but you don't give me a spoon. Did they expect me to stir with my fingers!!?? Even after the honey it needs to get diluted. Kinda glad they come often to refill my The cookie was nicely baked but can I taste the green tea... not much  Dinner:  I got the summer cavalier and my friend got the 48hr short rib donburi. Their dinner was amazing like the summer cavalier had corn, zucchini, edamame and some fresh greens. I've made mine a little special cause I didn't like tomatoes and red peppers. The cavalier was a little hard (under cooked) but over all it was very tasty. As for the donburi was really good, the meat was tender and juicy. They had a little bit of enoki mushroom and that was a little crispy!   Dessert: matcha roll was so flat... look at other reviews of the sesame roll, they were actually rounder and was placed standing up... the cake part was not soft it was kinda hard. To me I feel that the cake might of fell flat because it was missing a bit of baking Soda? It claimed that they have red bean paste but there was only a couple of red beans in it roll. Also I might think that the cream was not whipped to the fullest.   As for the lava cake, thanks for making it so there are lava! The thing that I feel like is the centre did not taste like cake batter but it tastes like a truffle centre.  I think the next time I'd just go for the entree only or try the pancake or even just get the ice cream cause that was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the soufflé pancakes for a long time, and I was happy to see that they finally opened one in Richmond Hill.   My boyfriend called at 6:30pm and the host said it wasn't busy; it LITERALLY took 10 minutes to get there, so it's now 6:40. Tell me how theres a line inside the restaurant.. how's that not busy? Anyways, we waited around 20-30 minutes and noticed that there were 6 seats available on the high table yet no one was being seated there.. another thing was they had booths that fit 4-6 people yet they sat 2 people there..... strange way to utilize the space.   The food pretty good we got the chicken and steak sandwiches with the potatoes (lemon garlic was bomb) the kimchi paella, and steak. Their short rib was sold out. We also got the pancake soufflé and I ordered it at the beginning when we ordered everything and was pretty mad to say the next table ordered it WAY after I ordered it and they got it before us.   The pancake soufflé was really good, it was light and airy with that egg waffle eggs taste.   Overall, it was pretty good just losing factors was the service. They're definitely more attentive than your average Chinese restaurant; refilling water, asking how your meal was, etc. I think they just need to work on the sitting and stuff."}
{"text":"It's like Richmond Court and Terre Rouge had a baby!  Came with a 6 top, ordered over half the menu to taste.  Apparently water is first come first serve as our two early bird medal winners were blessed with goblets of water while the rest of us are condemned to a full blown dining experience in the Sahara desert. Thank goodness the food was mostly underseasoned or I'd have really felt the damage when my tongue turned into jerky. Jerky which would have probably still tasted decent in comparison to the blessed by the devil seafood paella dish with spam and dried up rancid mussels.  To say that the experience was underwhelming would be invalid as one server placed and left an overwhelmingly large tray containing a small tea pot + a biscotti on our table which would have figuratively parted the red sea. Fortunately our food had not arrived yet, or we would have had to balance the dishes on our heads because god forbid we suggest the idea of not using ridiculously large gimmick trays.  This was originally a 2 star review that was going to be more elaborate. But thinking back on all of this has got me fuming."}
{"text":"I loved it not sure why some people are complaining so much, of course you have to wait for the food. It did take longer but you see it on the presentation and the flavor. The service is good very friendly which makes them approachable !! The decor is super chic. We also ordered the crab cakes and the steak. We loved everything, the only thing I would say is that the steak we ordered was not worth it $32 dollars for an over cooked steak when we asked for it to be well done, I don't blame them but rather blame myself for ordering a steak in a place where I should not have. My husband and I followed them on instagram and got two Iron Goddess soft serve ice cream which was delicious, i will be going back for that ice cream and to try other dishes and desserts."}
{"text":"I love this new restaurant. The decor is quite trendy. Using water pipes as part of the restaurant decor is very different and unique. As many people have mentioned, there is a 10% discount during their soft opening and free soft serve cream of the week if you check in on social media :)  I feel reluctant to write this review as this means more people will discover this new establishment and more people will flock to the business lol jk.    I tried to visit there on a Monday  but it isn't open on Mondays. So I came on a Friday nite and waited for about 20 mins for a table, which was not too bad. Please note Cafe Bon Bon does not take any reservations at all. If there is a line, the staff at the front does take your name and phone number and will call you once your table is ready. There are no round tables available but it does have a few oval tables by the wall, a few sofa chairs tables and a tall bar table. The kitchen is of open concept.  Once I sat down, I was ready to order right away. I wanted the souffle pancakes but no dessert menu was provided as the staff forgot to give me one. I ordered in Cantonese originally, knowing the establishment was Chinese but the waiter answered me back in English. However, one or the waitress did not don't understand English well when I inquired with a few simple questions such as what is the exact flavour of this soft serve ice cream. She didn't quite understand my question so I had to repeat myself. In the end, she just said some kind of tea   When the 48 hours short rib rice came, I asked for small bowls to the same waitress that couldn't understand english well because normally that is how I prefer to eat rice. She didn't understand what I meant by bowls even after I pointed my finger to a large bowl.  She brought me napkins instead.  So I asked again this time to a waitress in Cantonese for a bowl and this is when I found out there were no small bowls.  Btw, that dish is a must order. The dish was cooked sous vide style and was amazing. Definitely a reorder.    The Cafe Bon Bon Souffle pancakes didn't passed the jiggly test but they were still very fluffy and light.  I advised to eat it right away as it gets cold fast. I noticed that some tables got two pancakes while others like me got three. I think the same amount of batter is used but it really depends on how the kitchen makes the size of the pancakes, resulting in two or three pancakes per batter.  Cafe Bon Bon ended up being my first time trying Souffle Japanese pancakes and I am quite happy that it did not disappoint as I was looking forward to them. I am also happy that I don't need to travel so far to get my fix of Souffle Japanese pancakes. I had wanted to try them in DT but I was told they cut off the line by the time I got there :( (maybe I should have told them I came all the way from markham lol).  For their fried chicken, it looks like the restaurant increase the size of the dish, offering now five pieces of chicken.  I would said it was all right but it wasn't my favourite. I don't think I am used to the texture. I got the spicy version and it wasn't too spicy.  The small water bon bon cups are cute but they are simply too small for water cups. Maybe consider switching it to larger cups so it will result in less water refills?  The restaurant is still currently in its soft opening so it is still working on smoothing out all the kinks such as they saw that I finished eating my rice dish but my friends were not done quite yet but out came the ice cream. I was taken a little aback that it was ice cream time already lol  One guy brought plates but no knives when it came time for the pancakes. I had to ask for a knife. Also, they didn't clear out the empty cups once we were done with the ice cream and brought out the pancakes subsequently.  Despite the small mishaps here and there, it won't deter me from visiting again to try the rest of the menu. I am planning to revisit this establishment soon. Watch for my 2nd review :)"}
{"text":"we absolutely loved the decor and atmosphere at Café Bon Bon - it's a great ambience and definitely perfect for afternoon tea. the service hwoever, definitely needs work. keep in mind this review is based on the soft opening.   came here with my family for afternoon tea, got here around 530 pm and it wasn't too busy! we ordered the famous soufflé pancakes, they were sold out and said it would take 30 minutes to whip up more batter. it came after 30 mins - super fluffy as seen in pictures - i would compare it to the inside of the egg waffles .. it was served cool. do not expect it to be hot.   we also ordered the sesame roll cake served with their ice cream.. which was nothing out of the ordinary. my grandma enjoyed it since it wasn't overly sweet but she said she wouldn't want it again. they also ran out of spoons and decided that wasn't something they needed to tell us until we asked, so we ate it wth our forks.   they ordered the hot oriental beauty tea that came in a small pot. the tea was served warm not hot, which wasn't how my mother and grandma preferred. it poured maybe 3 little cups of tea, definitely not for sharing. my sister and i ordered the cold brew roasted iron goddess - it was served in a glass bottles, served in wine glasses... which was a bit annoying. i like tea in a regular tea cup or just a regular cup. the tea wasn't as strong as the server suggested ..   best part was probably the oolong tea ice cream that my sister and i got for free as their social media promo. i would definitely come back for the ice cream but they said we cannot order it on it's own - it comes with a few items on the menu. so i guess i'll just go to bang bang.   would i come back? maybe to try more food on the menu. the tea was okay, i'm used to having really strong teas so i do think it's a bit overpriced. that's just my opinion seeing as there's so many tea options around the area."}
{"text":"Great service, always checked to make sure our food and everything was ok.  We shared the fruit tea, short rib donburi, takoyaki, and soufflé pancakes.  The takoyaki was like an Italian arancini with octopus in the centre with a dipping sauce that tasted like a blend of bonito flakes, okonomiyaki sauce, and mayo.  The short rib was very tender and a good flavour as well.  They changed our plates before our dessert which was a very nice touch. The pancake wasn't jiggly but was very soft, moist, and had a great texture. Closer to the centre tasted more \"soufflé\" and you can really taste the egg.  Like their Facebook page for a free ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to hang out with girlfriends in Richmond Hill. Cafe is cute and chic, and they offer a great selection of dessert, coffee and tea. Fusion food is also available if you need more than just a bite!  Servers were also very attentive and courteous. We were probably checked upon a dozen times just to see if we were doing ok. Cups were never empty of water and were refilled every 20 minutes. We were probably here for 3 hours, and no one rushed us to leave! The only issue are the tables by the window. They are not big enough to accommodate all the plates of food. I strongly suggest the servers to bring out the entrees after the appetizers are done, and not all at the same time.  We ordered a couple dishes to share. I recommend the Kimchi seafood paella. It is essentially kimchi fried rice, topped with shrimp and mussels. Simple dish, with mild heat. I still liked it! I would skip the crab cakes and summer cavetteli. They weren't outstanding, especially the cavetteli. It was bland and texture was hard. I think it needed to be boiled in water for a little longer?? Soufflé pancake was lovely and tasted a lot like HK egg waffle. The tea flavored ice cream that accompanied the pancake was terrific!   For soft opening, you get 10% off your bill. You can pay by cash or credit card. Free ice cream when you like their social media page!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nicely decorated, seatings were comfortable, but the service and food were so so, if there's a \"0.5\" rating, it would be 2.5 stars.   Service: most of the waiters and waitresses were ok except for one. So we had a salad to share, this waitress came twice to try take away the salad when it was obviously not finished. I don't get why she had to keep coming to try taking away our food. So by the third time she came to take away the bowl, I just put the rest of the salad to my plate and let her take it, and I really wanted to tell her to just leave our food alone! Very frustrated.   Food: average, nothing much to describe. The savory dishes were better than the desserts (we had the matcha opera and soufflé pancake)."}
{"text":"Note: Kitchen closes at 2pm (lunch service), reopens at 5pm for dinner. I really wish they advertised this because I came here twice and failed to eat a proper meal. (The first time I thought it was just a specific maintenance issue)  TLDR: pricey menu, decent pancakes, good tea, delicious icecream, beautiful interior  Souffle Pancakes (3/5): eggy and fluffy, can see bits of the egg white, more solid than Hanabusa if you're looking for a comparison. Comes with icecream and some berries & berry sauce. I liked it, but it tastes better if you add some syrup. Takes 20+ minutes to make.  Roasted Iron Goddess Tea (4/5): so good! def check it out for tea connoisseurs. But again, pricey at $8/pot, and only hot water refills 'cause there are no tea leaves in the pot.   Black Tea Soft Serve Icecream (5/5)- SO GOOD with the nuts/crumble topping. Free during soft opening when you like their Instagram page.   Also 10% off during soft opening, so I don't feel as bad abt the price tag!"}
{"text":"Great ambience. Tea was really amazing. One of the best teas I've ever had. The gold and black interior really made it luxurious and the music was very soothing.   Great place for a date. The prices are a bit high but I guess with the quality of the tea and the service, it makes sense :)"}
{"text":"Cafe Bon Bon is on the short end of being gone gone from my dessert list. When we went, it's still their soft opening and they still have their promotion - 10% off + free ice cream (when you post your food/drink on social media). You can find this on their website.  Dessert 2/5 ---------- We ordered the souffle pancake as the concept intrigued me. The dish came with 3 souffle pancakes (instead of 2 I see from the photos), a side of ice cream, and a few berries. Now, I'm not a souffle expert by any means, but I do know that the egg whites shouldn't be visible. It seemed like the egg whites and batter weren't folded properly. Unfortunately this was the case here. The souffle pancakes were consistently fluffy, but when you cut through it, the inside is still a bit underdone and you can notice chunks of the whisked egg whites. I do think they could have added a bit more powdered sugar on top to enhance the taste, but I will say the souffle pancake paired really well with the tea-flavoured ice cream.  JAS TIP: the souffle pancake does take about 30 - 45 minutes to be ready, so don't go in with an empty stomach or take advantage of the promotion ;)  Verdict: Despite a disappointing souffle pancake, I do like the overall concept of the dish. I'll say this dish is high risk, high reward (It does cost $14). If made correctly, this will taste really good. As for their \"soft opening\", I wouldn't recommend it until they work on whisking those egg whites. Skip over that and try their other dessert.   Drink 4/5 ---------- I've been craving for match green tea iced latte this whole week, so there was no doubt I was going to order when I saw it on the menu. It seemed like they took their time in making it as the drink looked stunning. The added foam on top was a nice touch to the drink. The drink wasn't too sweet which was great because you can really taste the bitterness from the matcha.   Verdict: if you're looking for a cold tea drink, I'll give this latte a try.   Service 3/5 ---------- I didn't encounter any major issues with their service. The latte came with less ice as requested, waters were frequently refilled, the waiter took our orders with no issues, and they were approachable. I wouldn't say they provided exceptional service, but it won't be something you'll complain about after you're done.  Atmosphere 4/5 ---------- The decor in the cafe is pretty amazing and sets a really nice mood when you step in. Everything seemed very elegant and cute-looking, living up to the bon bon standard. I will say that the washroom is quite small, making it a challenge to move around, especially when you want to avoid stepping on wet spots left behind by those who have trouble aiming.  Overall, the soft opening promotion is definitely a nice incentive to give this a try. Perhaps I'll come back to try their food, but for dessert, that's questionable."}
{"text":"We went for Cafe Bon Bon's soft opening and received 10% off our bill. The restaurant was modern and spacious & the service was quick and attentive.  FOOD: 48H Short Rib Donburi ($19.00) The meat was extremely tender and portion size was adequate.  Wild Mushroom Toast ($8.00) This was delicious!!! I highly recommend this appetizer.  Overall, I would definitely come back and try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Cafe Bon Bon fell a little short on their dessert. When I was first walked in, I was impressed by the decor. They have the golden theme across the cafe which gave a very sleek, clean and elegant impression.  I ordered the Souffle Pancakes ($14) it came with soft serve ice cream, some strawberries, blueberries, one blackberry and 3 pieces of souffle. The souffle itself was a disappointing. It was under cooked which gave an unpleasant mushy texture! :( Also, the batter wasn't folded in properly - you can still see lumps of egg whites. The soft serve ice cream which came with the dessert was pretty good. It had a smooth texture and I can taste a little essence of tea. If there was a tub of that ice cream, I would totally devour that in no time! :)   Overall, the dessert was MEH but I heard the savory dishes were pretty good. I might give that a try next time I'm around."}
{"text":"Not sire why someone put one star to this cafe.  We went there on Saturday evening, decor is great, food is good.  The atmosphere like a high end hotel cafe.  Short rib donburi is good. Meat is tender. They had decent drink selection. No bubble teas or milk tea.  Dessert is great and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I only tried two menu items and two drinks so far so it's hard to say if I'm a fan. When we went a few weekends ago around 1 pm, there was no line and we were seated right away. The service was friendly and attentive. We tried the pancake souffle and the 48 hour short rib. I would say the pancake souffle just met my expectations. It was cooked through but it wasn't very high and souffle like. It was rather stubby but nevertheless airy and light. There was 3 pieces, with some berries and ice cream. I thought it was a good experience but it's not something that I'd go back for. It kind of lacks \"substance\", like it's missing some elements to the dish. The short rib was very good. Tender, flavourful, and paired well with the other ingredients, I thought this was a winner.  Our drinks were okay. I ordered a latte and it was fine, but not something I'd come specifically for. I thought the prices were a bit on the high side considering the plates weren't very substantial."}
{"text":"Saw some good and bad reviews and deco makes me feel like a visit!  Wow!  $7 for a coffee / tea!?!?  Are u serious??  Richmond Hill people is not that rich!    Ordered kimchi seafood paella $26 which they put canned \"lunch meat\" and smelly mussels!  I know this time of the year, the quality of mussel is not steady!  Then, don't put on the menu as a regular item.   Hot dishes were disappointed!   Let's give a chance for the dessert.  The only item interested was the dark chocolate lava cake $11.  However, had been told SOLD OUT!  We were the second tables of the day and the first table asked for the bill!   Boss!   Please re-organizing the menu and kitchen before open the restaurant if u want the investment back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Located in the Times Square Plaza. You get 10% discount during soft opening and free tea flavoured soft serve ice cream if you follow them on social media. The restaurant decor is nice and comfortable, like a west elm showroom. I think this cafe is headed in the right direction but there's room for improvement! I enjoyed the meal but for this price I would expect the food quality to be better!  First, food is a bit on the expensive side. The short ribs in the 48hr Short Rib Donburi is really tender and I would order it again, but could be better if the rice in the middle is less gooey. I would not recommend the kimchi seafood paella...for $23, you would expect the mussels to at least be fresh but they were not. We got the Japanese Soufflé Pancakes for dessert and they were decent. Not as thick/ jiggly as the ones you would have in Japan...but the flavour is decent. Tea flavoured soft serve was good too. My friend thought the tea flavoured could be stronger.  Overall I would go back and try other things on the menu. I hope they'll improve! The cafe has comfortable seating and would be great for a meal with a few friends."}
{"text":"Needed a place to go to after dinner, and a friend recommended Cafe Bon Bon. Was a bit hesitant, because I was a bit worried about the price, since the cafe looked like a high-class, expensive place.   Was definitely pleasantly surprised. The prices are ok-ish: coffees are a tad bit expensive, but the dessert prices are ok!). I got the Bon Bon Affogato ($6). The ice cream had a great \"tie guan yin\" taste to it. The coffee and the walnut bits complimented each other very well.   Overall, would definitely recommend this place (so far). Haven't seen or experienced anything (yet) that would warrant loosing a star! Will update when I visit again!"}
{"text":"I came here during soft opening and was happy about the 10% off and free ice cream. The place definitely is very downtown restaurant brunch vibes given the decor. I love the gold, white and blue theme. However, I waited 45+ minutes to be seated and honestly, I feel like the way they've made the seating isn't using the space very well. We tried the slow cooked short rib donburi. I thought it was good combination of flavours but honestly, $19 is not worth it. The cold brewed teas were presented very nicely in the glass bottle and there was a variety of options. I tried the lychee calpis soda drink and thought that was pretty good too. Service on the other hand was just okay and not sure why but the waitresses seemed a bit confused when taking orders. As for the free ice-cream, it was delicious and my favourite part of my visit as it was a nice milk tea flavour which I love! Nonetheless, I don't think I will be coming here again since it was pricey and just a one time experience for me."}
{"text":"Not happy, cafe closes at 10pm and when I arrived at 9:05PM I was as informed the last call was done at 9:00PM.   What does it mean, please leave!"}
{"text":"The best experiences come from zero expectations! Or am I just stating the obvious!? Didn't have a clue what this place was about until I got here. The seating was comfortable and service top of the class. There was not a single moment where my glass was not filled with water and empty plates not collected. They anticipated my needs before I could even realize what they were lol At one point I almost dropped all the plates and utensils by trying to distribute them and two servers immediately teleported to my assistance even though I had it all under control (or so i thought). Customer service is honestly a deal breaker for all businesses. I don't know about y'all, but I am more likely to go back to a resto with mediocre food but fantastic service than a bad service resto with good food!   The interior design is right on with minimalistic lines, gold accents and a tasteful wall display of terrariums. They also be bougie-ing it up with their name printed on their glassware.  We ordered the the baby gem salad- incredibly fresh ingredients paired with the perfect vinegrette!  There was nothing special to note about the kimchi seafood paella but it wasn't horrible. I especially enjoyed the soufflé pancakes! The texture was like marshmallows lol the taste was eggy with just the right amount of sugar. And the best part?? NO 2 hour wait bullshit ahem cough cue fuwa fuwa Cough ahem."}
{"text":"4 star for the food and 5 star for the service. The waiters are very attentive. While we are waiting for the table, they noticed I am pregnant and get a chair for me to sit. Glasses are always filled with water.  Must try the short rib donburi, mushroom toast and souffle pancake."}
{"text":"I was anticipating it's opening since they first put up their Cafe Bon Bon sign lol. I was surprised that such a classy and modern cafe would choose to open in Times Square. But I'm happy for the addition because I get another place to have lunch in the future :) At this time, they are having their soft opening from 3pm to 10pm Tuesday-Sunday, and closed Monday.  Prices are on the higher end, but I stand by their quality. The food presentation looks fantastic. The dishes on the menu, I would say, are Eurasian style (Korean-Spanish, Italian-Japanese, and other fusion cuisine.) The whole cafe is also quite instagrammable... I was so tempted to put the plate on the floor for a shot, but I felt like eyes would be all over me, and we were practically the only table lol.  Staff are still in training, but they are doing a great job. English seems to be their 2nd language, but they are fluent in Mandarin Chinese. Nonetheless, I love how they excel in attention to details, and that they strive for excellence in service.  I'm absolutely a fan of the light and fluffy soufflé pancakes! I've never had them before, so I have nothing to compare it with. The pancakes came with fresh fruits and a side of their housemade milk tea soft serve, which was a fantastic pairing. It takes 20 minutes to make, so be sure you order this when you sit down. I'd definitely order this again! Pancakes date, anyone? :)"}
{"text":"I dropped by Cafe Bon Bon with my sis earlier this week and was pleasantly surprised by the place. It stands out a lot from the other asian restaurants at times square.  The decor and atmosphere is definitely cute and well thought out. It's sleek, modern,minimalist and a bit luxurious.  It's casual  but at the same time a little bit upscale.   The service was polite and attentive. My server Rex notified me that there would be no food served during 2 to 5 pm, which was fine since i wasn't really hungry anyway. Rex was a really patient server and I genuinely felt cared for !!   Okay, so i didn't get any \"food\"  BUT, I did get dessert, coffee and tea. The chocolate hazelnut mousse was actually really good. It came in a cute dome shape and ice cream on the side. I really liked the addition of the caramel and hazelnut bits in the cake. Surprisingly, the cake wasn't too sweet and paired well with my drink.  Honestly, not much to say about my flat white, since I'm pretty whatever about my coffee, but I thought it was \"good\"  My sister got the Iron goddess tea and it was honestly the bomb, as a tea lover (my sis to), I/we have to say that this beats the other bbt lounges that serve tea. Their tea is strong and flavorful, definitely some higher end stuff.  Overall, I personally really liked it. I felt pretty pampered and relaxed during my visit and enjoyed eating some cake and coffee.  I'll be  back to try the food and update my review then."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for dinner and noticed that everyone was ordering cold brew tea. We were the only ones that came for dinner. Based on the menus from yelp, we though the kimchi paella would be cheaper but it wasn't. It was $26 instead of $23. So, the girls decided to get the short rib sous vide donburi, which was a much more reasonable price. It was also recommended by the waiter.   I ordered the salad gem and the deep fried chicken. Both dishes were amazing. The salad tasted fresh and the chicken was flavourful yet pungent.  One of the girls said the short ribs melted in her mouth and gave me a piece. She was right. However, it felt more like I was eating beef brisket more than short ribs.   Earlier, I debated on whether or not to get the steak. It was over $30 and I thought to myself that I could get AYCE KBBQ for that price. What's the point of me wasting it here?  The atmosphere was nice and calming. We were probably the loudest people in the room. However, I don't know if I'd come here for dinner again. The price is a bit hefty and I don't think a steak is ever worth $30. Dessert seemed alright but we had our own. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the reason that they have yet to perfect their service execution  We arrive one workday lunch with 4 hungry for food ladies and 2 famished men. There was a good 30 minute wait for our table. They said it was first come first serve irregardless the table seating size so there we were waiting, seeing party of 2 seated on a table for 6 . By the time our turn came a table for 2 showed up , we weren't called . The one next in line was called obviously because the table wasnt enough. And this happened twice after until finally one table for 6 cleared . Really ??! We weren't even allowed to order ahead.   Fortunately for them the food tasted good, our favorite was the Pork Short Rib Don Buri . The meat is cooked on Sou Vide process making it tender and brought out the meats natural tasty flavors. The pancake souffle however was a bit overhyped for me , it was not has heavenly as it looked. The Kimchi Paella was good although it lacked a little more of that \"oomph\".  I would probably come back eventually but  not soon."}
{"text":"Soufflé pancakes uptown was what got me to pay a visit. But i have to say i was way more impressed by the food than dessert.   What i ordered:  Sparkling lychee calpis  Mochaccino Arancini takoyaki Chicken sandwich with crispy potatoes  Kimchi seafood paella Soufflé pancakes Hazelnut chocolate dome  Free house-made soft serve (check-in and follow on social media)  Came on a saturday for late lunch and had to wait. There were two groups ahead of us but it didnt take too long. I they take your number in case u wna go out for and spin and theyll call you when ur table is ready. As for the food, the lychee calpis was good. But nothing extravagant that id order it again. The takoyaki was a good spin on the originally using risotto rice to replace the original batter. The chicken breast in the sandwich wasnt dry and they were very generous on the melted brie. The potatoes were truly crispy. The paella was prob my fav. Lots of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop). The kimchi flav was subtle. Asked if we could have our desserts come at the same time cuz the soufflé pancakes take around 20mins to prep. Our server made it sound like it was mission impossible, but he made it happen LOL however, dessert was just okay. Hence disappointing cuz it was what i came for. The soufflé pancakes werent as fluffy and jiggy as i imagined and they were a little sticky inside. Hazelnut chocolate dome was too sweet for my liking. The house-made soft serve was pretty good tho! It was like a milk tea flav.  It was a pretty expensive lunch. But our bellies were full and happy!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars but it does show promises to a 4 star rating.  Service was great, lovely decor, but just some improvements are needed on a few food items.  It's really nice to see a new fusion style restaurant in Richmond Hill area that opened about 2 months ago.  The restaurant is located at the Times Square mall.  There are lots of good restaurants/bakeries/cafes here that are a bit dated so this is a great new addition to the mall.  Came here with my family recently for a birthday celebration.  There aren't a lot of large tables so we were quite lucky that they manage to rearrange a few small tables at the back to accommodate the 8 of us.  It is still soft opening so not a huge selection on the dinner menu.  Some of us got the Tropical Smoothie and Mixed Berry Smoothie which were delicious.  You may find it a bit pricey for $9 but for me it was worth it!  As for the food, we really enjoyed the Short Rib Donburi and NY steak which were both perfectly done. However, the Kimchi Seafood Paella was a bit disappointing.  It looked really good but didn't have enough Kimchi flavour and the seafood was only okay.   We also got the Summer Cavatelli pasta dish which was a bit sweet in flavour and not too tasty.  They are offering now the 10% soft opening discount.  Overall, we enjoyed our evening and we would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lovely decor, totally felt like a Holts or some fancy cafe in Europe. Super friendly staff. Good options for coffee, tea and food. Desserts seemed a bit limited but they did have the souffle pancake unique to uptown (at the moment). While a bit on the pricier side, the ambience and quality of service made it worth checking out. It was hard to pick where to sit because there were so many pretty spots!  Came here with friends on a Tuesday night. My 48h donburi was good and my friends enjoyed their crab cakes. Quality of shortrib meat was great, super tender. Best part was the crab cakes were made with real crab, not imitation crabmeat. Crab cakes came with a choice of either salad or potato fritters.  I wanted to order decaf coffee but was told it is unavailable. Suggestion to management: consider adding decaf coffee to the menu as decaf options are pretty standard at a cafe, especially a high end one like Cafe Bon Bon.  We also got free ice cream for posting on social media. The ice cream was made in house and tasted like oolong tea flavor. Slightly bitter with a nutty taste. Really refreshing and well made!  Overall, great first experience and will come back."}
{"text":"The Chef is very detail on the ingredients he put on each dish.  You can tell he is cooking from his heart. Excellent combinations and it makes you enjoy every bite.  I love the Mushroom toast. For people who like cooking, must know Mushroom is very hard to deal with and the chef makes it so good, very strong fragrance from the mushroom.  The Carbonara is not as heavy as it used to be with other restaurants.  The quality of the food is worth every single buck.  Finally, we have some quality food in uptown."}
{"text":"For table of 4, we paid a total bill of $120 plus 10% off because one of the staff poured melted ice cream on my friends chair, and scarf. Luckily she was out from her seat when that happened. The original staff wasn't apologetic and left, while the other staff stepped in to clean. I think the general manager came later to apologize and offer to dry clean the scarf or have us bring the receipt if we opt to clean it ourselves. We didn't want the hassle, so they just offered us the 10% off our bill.  Onto the food, we ordered:  Drunken chicken with sweet and sour sauce - juicy chicken and the sweet and sour sauce is really plum sauce.   Kimchi seafood paella - it was cooked well with loads of fresh seafood   Crab cake tostada - not your traditional tostada, but overall it was a miss. It didn't have much crab taste and it was a bit too fishy for my taste.  48h short rib rice - the beef was really tender and delicious, but the teriyaki-like sauce is a tad too sweet for  my liking   Mocha frappe - I was told it was really good  Original soufflé pancake with earl grey ice cream - the pancake was alright, but the earl grey ice cream is really good!  Overall, the service was alright. For the price point, I would expect better quality of customer service. Our waiter was not very good and not informative when we asked him questions about the menu. I also saw him rubbing his nose a few times then grabbing utensils and drinks to service another table. It's pretty terrible in my book.   The food was hit and miss, and for the price point and service I can get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"The interior is stunning with the gold and white colour scheme. It's also very clean and well-maintained. They are still in the \"soft-opening\" phase even though it's been about a month.  I ordered the lychee sparkling calpis drink and tried the soufflé pancakes. Both were just okay in my opinion. The drink looks cool and you mix it first before consumption. The sparkling lychee is distinct, but the calpis yogurt is nonexistent. For $8, the return for value is not good. The pancakes are more soufflé than pancake. The taste is plain and there is no sauce to go with it. I'd rather have a regular soufflé instead. It's $14 for three pieces. I'm willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Cafe Bon Bon is a classy restaurant in a not so classy plaza. Their venue is gorgeous, the staff are friendly, and the atmosphere was quite welcoming. We ordered an Americano, a Matcha Latte, and an original Souffle Pancake. Quality-wise, all were decent. My only gripe about this place is that their food selections are quite pricey. If you want to spend a few hours here for dessert and drinks with some friends, check this place out. If you're looking for a full-on meal, get ready to pay an arm and a leg. Regardless, I recommend visiting once at the very least, just for novelty."}
{"text":"Although the service is good and the 48H Ribs is exceptional, unfortunately the drinks (Matcha Latte and Milk Tea) were disappointing for the relatively high prices. The fried potatoes were just that... virtually cut up potatoes with nothing special.   The atmosphere, food presentation, perhaps the hot drinks and definitely the service are extremely exceptional. I hope as time moves on they will improve the food quality"}
{"text":"TL;DR the donburi was good but do not order the hot tea unless you don't mind being completely ripped off!  ATMOSPHERE Very modern and simple decor.   FOOD 5 piece drunken fried chicken ($11) - battered and fried boneless chicken. It was crispy however there was very little chicken inside. Very overpriced.   48h short rib donburi ($19) - the meat was very tender and I really liked the flavour/texture of the rice. Good dish overall.  DRINKS I ordered the Roasted Iron Goddess hot tea ($7)- basically it's an oolong tea. The tea comes with a small butter cookie. The cookie was nothing special but a nice touch. The teapot was small and to my surprise, there was no teabag/tealeaves inside. I thought maybe it was a mistake and as I looked around, I could see that people who ordered the cold teas all had teabags. I asked the waiter if my pot was missing a teabag and she said, \"No, but do you want some hot water?\". Are you serious? I HAVE NEVER FELT SO ROBBED IN MY LIFE. $7 for a small pot of tea water?  Suggestion: Please put in writing on the menu that there is no teabag for the hot teas. I think people should be made aware of this. It is not the normal practice - everywhere I have ever ordered HOT tea, there is a teabag. Also, I don't understand why there is a teabag for the cold teas but not the hot teas.   Overall, the atmosphere and presentation of the food was excellent however the price is not worth it. I'd rather spend the money elsewhere so I definitely will not return."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new cafe after seeing some of the pics posted by fellow Yelpers. I was impressed by the plating and service but the food was underwhelming. I tried several of their signature dishes including the kimchi paella and the sous bide beef donburi. My favourite was actually the mushroom toast but I guess you can't really do that wrong. Their signature souffle pancakes were light and fluffy - obviously can't compare to those in Japan but yummy nonetheless. The chocolate lava cake was average and probably wouldn't order it again. Overall a nice place with good decor and ambiance, but I would come here more for that and not the food itself."}
{"text":"This might be one of the most expensive lunch I had in Richmond Hill. Even with 10% Soft Opening Discount my bill was over $40 with tips.  Maybe I am a big eater but I finished everything I ordered with no problem.   What I had:  Flat White ($5) - Meh as the milk was not frothed probably. At this price point and with a Slayer Machine, I expected to be much better. The waiter was nice and offered to make me another one but still the same issue  48H Short Rib Donburi ($18) - Tender with good flavour. Rice was nice an fluffy. Probably the best for value   Souffle Pancakes ($14) - When I ordered this, it only came with 2 pancakes. It was way overpriced but I think now they serves 3 pancakes per order - Nice and fluffy which I enjoyed. I wish there is a little more element on the side to make it taste more interesting  Service was a little green but hopefully that would improve over time. The price point is high for the area and what the cafe offers. I do understand that business needs to make a profit but we customers do want to have a good dining experience without feeling being ripped off.  10% off still make Cafe Bon Bon worth trying but I am not sure if I would willing to pay full prices for the dining experience.  BTW, just for reference: A 12 oz NY Striploin at The Keg cost $36 VS A 10 oz NY Striploin at Cafe Bon Bon cost $32. I have yet tried Cafe Bon Bon's steak. I hope it worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Overall good dining experience. Recently opened so the servers came in pairs, 1 training the other which i thought was good.  Environment: very nicely decorated, good for a date spot uptown. Not too many nice dinner date spots besides the big box places.  Service: usually when i go to a restaurant uptown 90% of the time the servers have a hard time communicating with me. But this time the communication was so good, and they were very informative about the dishes. Love when the staff knows whats being served instead of just serving the good.  Food: asian canadian fusion style. So expect some nice plating along with flavourful dishes  Price: a little bit pricey but you get what you pay for. If i had a date id bring her here.  Tip: finish off with the iron goddess ice cream! Sooo good."}
{"text":"Dropped by Cafe Bon Bon for dessert since it was popping up all over my feeds and found it to be just ok. Aesthetically, the place is beautiful and the service was quite good but the food was subpar. We ordered their Soufflé Pancakes ($14), an Affogato ($8) and a Matcha Latte ($6) and got a free Iron Goddess soft serve.  The Soufflé Pancake was ready in about 20 minutes after ordering (no extra wait as the restaurant was not very busy). It was soft and light around the sides but I found the centre to be a little wet (instead of custardy) and I suspect it might have needed an extra 30-60 seconds cooking time. It also had a very eggy flavour which some might like but I much preferred the souffle pancakes at Hanabusa. The fruits on the side added a nice pop of color but was not incredibly sweet. The one thing I did REALLY enjoy was the Iron Goddess soft serve that came with the pancake. It was extremely fragrant and aromatic.  The Affogato was not bad - vanilla bean soft serve is topped with a shot of hot espresso and crumbled candied walnuts. The ice cream itself was average but the espresso shot was strong and bold and mixed with the creaminess of the soft serve, created a velvety aromatic experience. The nuts added a sweetness and bit of crunch to this dessert.  The Matcha Latte was a complete fail in my opinion. It looked pretty but after getting past the top layer of foam, it tasted very watery and bland. For $6, I expected MUCH better.  If you're looking for a nice place to sit down with a friend; or if you're itching to try the famous Japanese Soufflé Pancakes and are unwilling to go downtown, this is a good option. I'm hoping that they will put the Iron Goddess soft serve as an item on the menu since it was quite good. I heard from some one that you can order it on its own but it's $5 for a cup (which isn't that big).   Given the price point and general quality of the dishes I tried, I would give it a 1.5 but bumped up to two for good service and decor.  For their soft opening, Cafe Bon Bon is offering 10% off and a free soft serve for those who follow them on social media."}
{"text":"Five stars for everything! This is my favourite uptown cafe. The decor is cute, atmosphere is cosy, service is attentive, and the food... amazing! Their Japanese soufflé pancakes paired with their milk tea soft serve, delicious! I heard some people complaining the pancakes are bland and tasteless... well they are pancakes so what did you expect? Everything about this place is on point. They're still currently offering 10% off during their soft opening period. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Once you step into Cafe Bonbon, you no longer feel like you're in Times Square. The setting is more upscale and I can see this being in a setting like Yorkdale. It's modern and spacious with brassy gold accents and succulents lining the tables. They had many people staffed; probably in training since the servers usually came up to our table in a pair. The servers were very polite, thoughtful, and considerate. They seemed to have a shy personality and are pretty quiet when they talk to you. When they were serving us our water, they double checked the cup to ensure the \"Cafe Bon Bon\" logo was facing us. When replacing our cutlery, they noticed my friend dropped her napkin and went to get a new one before placing her new cutlery down.  Onto the food now. It's a cafe so the portions are small. We had dinner before we came so our main priority was dessert.   Soufflé Pancakes ($14) - We ordered this first since it requires 20 minutes prep time. Since there were four of us, we got two orders of this to share. All the desserts come with their tea flavoured softserve, made in-house. The soft serve and the soufflé pancake was so deliciously light and fluffy. It was so satisfying and I could've finished another order of it!  Arancini Takoyaki ($11 for 3 pcs) - These risotto balls were so good. It was crispy on the outside yet soft, but not mushy, on the inside. There was a good amount of octopus inside each one.   Drunken Fried Chicken, Sweet & Sour ($11 for 5 pcs) - My coworker ordered this for takeaway. Her thoughts were that it was soggy (which is inevitable for takeout), portions were too small and too thin.   Spaghetti Carbonara ($18) - I got this for takeaway for my boyfriend. It's topped with thinly sliced asparagus. His thoughts were that it was too salty and the spaghetti was a bit too hard. I tried a little bit and also thought it was too salty.   Kimchi Seafood Paella ($23) - IMO, the paella was a bit too salty for my liking (but not as salty as the Spaghetti Carbonara). It's a decent size. We each had some but had to pack the rest because there was so much left over. I actually think it tasted better the following day. Maybe more time for the flavours to set?  There were some small hiccups here and there but that's understandable since it's still their soft opening. The only downside I see is that it is quite pricey, but you are paying for the full package (the atmosphere, the service, and of course, the food). Even the bathroom is nice! Individual stalls with Dyson hand dryers and Simplehuman garbage cans! Haha. You can tell a lot's been invested into this place. I think it's a great setting for a date with your S/O or your girlfriends.   3.5 stars since I think the savoury food needs improvement. It's still new and I can't wait to see how their menu will expand after the soft opening. I know I will be back very soon to have the Soufflé Pancakes again!"}
