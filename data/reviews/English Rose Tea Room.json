{"text":"Awesome place, I took my daughter for her birthday and she loved it as well. Quite, clean and wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Very nice tea room with cozy atmosphere.  It is where you wear a hat and gloves are optional.  Very girly and fun.  The gift shop next door has so many unusual and unique items."}
{"text":"High Tea is always a special  event for my family...  around the world or in the homeland.... High Tea is a must. NYC...Orlando...London.....and now Carefree, AZ Watercress Sandwiches , delicious sweets and scrumptious clotted cream...moist scones and fancy hats for everyone. This little piece of England in the desert.. is not to be missed...."}
{"text":"An amazing amount of things in a little space. Pretty decorations and nicely decorated tables ( which are very close to each other). The soup and sandwiches were very nice and refreshing. The small pot of tea was 2-3 cups and just right. The wait staff were very attentive and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Fun place for something different. Need to call ahead."}
{"text":"If I could give this place six stars I would. Authentic imports, including devon cream, scottish treats (made in Scotland, not a USA affiliate) and the most heavenly tea you could ever imagine.  Very quaint, cozy and perfect way to slow down and share a civilized experience. Very reasonably priced. It's a very different experience than you will find at the Four Seasons, Phoenician or the former Ritz Carlton, but equally intimate and special. Appreciate the authentic scones!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience at the ENGLISH ROSE TEA ROOM yesterday. We waited a very long time before our order was taken and we were there early in the day. The tea was served in a pottery teapot NOT bone china and this was surprising. The scones and Devon Cr√®me were exquisite. The tea was not special at all--it was weak and had little flavor at all. The little sandwiches had dry bread and skimpy filling so they were tasteless. The desserts were acceptable except for the carrot cake which was dry. The service was very bad. Our serving girl never stopped by our table. We had to flag her down for more tea.  It was not a memorable event and I will not return."}
{"text":"I am British and I know my tea, so 5 stars for this English Rose gem in charming Carefree ! My girlfriends had organized an outing so I was amazed when we sat in what could have been the Queen of Englands Windsor tea room ! Deliciously girly and full of vintage British china and knick knacks all for sale at great prices. The food is traditional english high tea fare - yummy scones with cream and jam, sandwiches, soups and salads. And a great cuppa tea from a menu of over 75 flavours ! This hot spot gets busy, yet the staff were sweet and very accommodating. After eating we strolled next door to their British home decor shop - Jo London ! Packed with nostalgia, english furniture and artwork, antique British items and a witty array of cards and hostess gifts. We had a great afternoon and shall certainly return soon."}
{"text":"I went here with my grandma when I visited Arizona from Michigan. It's super cute, full of British touches and adorable decor. I recommend eating outside. A lot of people stopped and took pictures while we were eating, but I didn't mind. We got the caramel peach tea with coconut and scones and it was amazing. There were baby birds in one of the tea kettle chandeliers above us, adding more excitement. Carefree is a cute little town, and this place makes it cuter."}
{"text":"We had a great time today at the English Rose Tea Room.  I took my 12 yr old daughter and she loved it also.   We took lots of pictures, ate yummy food and had an enjoyable experience.  There was a club of Rolls Royce Owners that must have had a monthly meeting at the restaurant so things were a bit busy and our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed but it was wonderful anyway.  I would strongly recommend a reservation and you need to be patient as nothing about this is a \"rushed\" experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice place I gave it 4 stars only for the fact that it is not well laid out. Dining is extremely cramped even if you have a reservation for a window table. We felt we were on a plane BUT the food was very good! Food good  Uncomfortable seating"}
{"text":"Recently had my daughter's Bridal Shower at the Tearoom and what a wonderful celebration. Jo and her staff were a treat to work with. The ambiance totally fit the theme of the Shower. The food was a culinary delight. The lemon sponge cake was very tasty. Great place for lunch or High Tea."}
{"text":"I was turned on to this Tearoom by my good friend Cindy.   The place is small and very darling.  You walk in and immediately are greeted by the owner of one of three other women who work there faithfully.  The decor is very Victorian.  There is a wide variety of beautiful China tea cups, pots and teas for sale as well as many other items to compliment a formal tea at your home.  When you enter and are seated, you will find beautifully laid tables.  The table is laid out for a formal tea.   They offer everything from fresh, out of the oven scones to the traditional tiered plate offerings of finger sandwiches, cheese and fruit.  If you are wanting something more substantial, I would recommend their bread pudding (to die for!) or their beautiful Waldorf salad.  The food is very fresh, prepared well, and presented well.   The selections of tea are vast and they also offer a tea of the day just to keep the variety going.  While there, you are offered to \"dress up\" if you so desire.  A darling array of Boas and Hats are offered to guests to use while dinning.  They are great for pictures and make a special event all the more festive.  Besides the ambiance, the food is always of excellent quality.  Fresh, and the best of everything is used.  Please save room for dessert!  You won't want to miss their traditional English offerings.  My only complaint with the place is that the tables, chairs, and room are small.  There isn't much room to move, and the tables are packed together pretty tight.  If you are any bigger than 5'2\" and 100 lbs, you will be uncomfortable in their chairs.  Very small and not good on the back.  If you are wanting a darling experience with a Tea Room, with excellent food, you won't be disappointed.  During the peak season you will want to make reservations.  With a small amount of tables, they fill up fast and are a favorite in the Carefree area.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Although a bit of a drive, The English Rose Tea Room was well worth it! This was the perfect place for my sister and I to spend a morning brunch on my birthday, yet I hear advanced reservations for any size party is a must, as they are constantly booked for special occassions. Service was excellent and this experience felt much more \"authentic\" than high tea at a resort. With its extremely pink and girly atmosphere, it's safe to say that you might wanna leave the guys at home :)  The tea was exceptionally good. We got the \"Paris\" which was a black tea infused with caramel and blackcurrent, what they call a house favorite. The waitress kindly refilled our pot with hot water (they use loose leaves, so it can last up to 2 pots). I highly suggest the Tea for Two special. It comes with a 3-tiered rack of 3 types of tea sandwiches, scones, and various desserts. Most people next to us got salads, which looked equally yummy.  In addition, they also have a chest full of numerous ornate hats to wear while enjoying your tea. This was too fun!"}
{"text":"3 Star food- the tea sandwiches were skimpy and lacked much flavor. The scones were excellent however the cream and jam served was minimal. No lemon curd was offered.  3 Star tea service - had a decent selection of teas to choose from. Although had to ask the server for more hot water twice. 1 Star for service - The server was a delight and the food was delivered promptly. However after finishing our tiny little sandwiches and scones the proprietor of the restaurant walked up and handed us a \"to go\" container for our desserts, the bill and then walked away. Not a thank you or a smile!  I guess that meant we were no longer welcome in her establishment.  This left a very bad taste in my mouth about this tea room. It's very pricey and cramped for space."}
{"text":"So......I have to say that I have traveled all over the world and I have yet to come across anyplace that tops this in terms of high tea. Once you get past the super fun decor that is VERY pink and girly, the tea is delicious. The scones are massive and the food is delish. Unfortunately she has spoiled me and I have compared all of my high tea experiences to hers and I find them all wanting. I will fly to Arizona for her tea and scones!!  p.s. I am currently having high tea at a fabulous hotel and they still don't compare to the English rose tea room."}
{"text":"The service, atmosphere, food and tea are 5 star!!! So refreshing to dine somewhere that is firing on all cylinders! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience but service is lacking....Staff /owner needs to adjust their attitude...  I recommend The Heard Museum North down the street...."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and have enjoyed my experience both times. The ERTR is a very unique and quaint little place. The tea is absolutely amazing. The staff appear to be pretty knowledgeable in the tea department and helped my party pick the right teas for us. While the menu isn't cheap, I think you are also paying for the experience. The scones are delicious. Not like a sweet hard scone you would get at a bakery. These are buttery and thick and delicious. The tea sandwiches are also very good. My one critique is the desserts. None are homemade, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But none are memorable either. I have gotten high tea twice and found that I just don't really like the desserts. They are kind of run-of-the-mill, something you might find in the frozen section of a grocery store. I'm not really a dessert person anyways. But other than that, this place is amazing! I highly recommend it if you enjoy tea and love a unique experience:)"}
{"text":"Once you get past the froo frooness of the shop, the actual experience is quite pleasant.   My girlfriend had wanted to take me here for quite sometime.  I hesitated because it was a very girly thing to do.  I finally obliged her and was surprised.  We ordered the Duchess of Bedford's Formal Afternoon Tea.  It was simply amazing.  Our tea was the Chocolate Rose.  The service was prompt and great and we also got to meet the owner, an Englishwoman, so this place is very authentic.    Just an FYI, I advise placing a reservation beforehand.  We got lucky but got a not so ideal table.    In short, if you want to be a good boyfriend and score points with the woman in your life, oblige her girly side and you'll be rewarded ;)"}
{"text":"To me this is like Disneyland to a child. I highly recommend that you call a week in advance to get the day and time you want.   It's a great place to bring out of town girlfriends, I have brought my husband and another couple to celebrate my birthday and brought my granddaughter to celebrate her birthday. She loved getting dressed up, with her own gloves and hat. She also loved everything on the nursery tea.    If you enjoy a particular tea while you are there, buy it. They are sometimes hard to find once you leave.   The service, food and atmosphere is excellent and the afternoon tea is $28 for two and has a wonderful selection."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a group of 8, to celebrate my daughter's bday. Got there and they did not have our table ready so we had to wait. Poor customer service. I had to ask for water refills, if we could use the hats, for the check, etc I felt that I was chasing after them to get things, totally ignored. I would never go back there.  I have done afternoon teas at many different tea rooms in Canada and never have experienced the poor customer/food service we received at this place. Food: the tea sandwiches were not good, scones are huge and dry, pastries I can buy better ones at my local AJ'S. I am giving one star because the setting is cute."}
{"text":"Once again another wonderful afternoon full of tea. We have been here 6 times and not one bad thing to say. Wonderful food, delicious scones, tasty tea, fabulous hats to wear and a very personable staff. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I offered to host my god daughter's wedding shower.  She wanted a tea and I had to figure this out from San Francisco.  I found the English Rose on line and never looked back.  Joanne, the owner, was wonderful and the event was brilliant.  The service was great, we had the place to ourselves after her regular hours, and the food varied, fun, and very English.  We even had a sweet keyboard player who stayed with us throughout playing softly in the background.  Too, perfect."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends to give it a try. We had the afternoon tea service which we really enjoyed. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the cramped seating. It felt like the people sitting next to us were part of our group. Then we felt rushed to get out because they wanted our table for another group. I'm not sure what the time limit is to eat, but I'll ask next time. We still had a good time and I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"This place is more about atmosphere. I go about once a year with friends for something fun to do. The menu is a bit pricey so we always share. We get the tier and split it... Honestly though 28 bucks for tiny cut sandwiches, two scones and tiny desserts?  They could knock the price down at least to 15.00 bucks.  The owner is very nice and staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Quite lovely. Delicious scones.  Tables are close for large people.  Lots of chatskys around.  Plop on one of their hats and pretend you are in London!"}
{"text":"This place is simply wonderful.  My mom and I come here about twice a year -- once in the summertime, and once in the winter -- and each time, I leave feeling like it was a wonderful experience.    The decor is just adorable, and I love all of the little personal touches, right down to the restrooms which are complete with British magazines -- the first time I noticed that, I couldn't help but giggle.  They have a lovely selection of hats that will completely your English tea experience, if you so desire.  ;-)  I especially love how each table is set up with an array of mismatched tea cups and saucers -- it doesn't get much cuter than that!  I haven't tried any food other than the scones -- my mom and I always just get the Cream Tea, which includes your own pot of tea (selection of your choice) and two scones (with Devon cream and jam -- amazing).  For us, this is plenty for breakfast.  The scones are huge, and almost overwhelming if you eat the entire plate.  So delicious, and beautifully presented.  The owner of this business is so sweet and kind, and she runs a fabulous place.  If you are looking to enjoy the perfect Girls' Day Out, a bridal luncheon, or any other girly event, this is the perfect place for you.  I would recommend this spot to anyone, and I truly believe that the English Rose Tea Room is wonderfully authentic and holds such an adorable wow-factor that you cannot help but enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a authentic English tea experience with yummy food - you have found your place! Book your reservation in advance as they fill up quickly. This time of the year its nice to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Only giving this place 4 stars because the owner seemed just a teensy bit standoffish, not too bad that I'd give it a super low rating, but noticeable enough that it was slightly upsetting. That might've just been her though, and for that, I can't fault! Anyways! On to the good parts. I pitched the idea of high tea to a couple of friends, because who doesn't love acting haughty and sticking your pinky out and dressing nice? I live in Tucson, so it was about a 4-5 hour drive there and back, but I don't really regret it! Me and my friends dressed to the nines and arrived while a party was being thrown for some adorable kids. Not a setback at all, we ordered some tea, some finger foods, and for myself, a quiche (it came with a salad). The finger foods (an assortment of desserts and crustless sandwiches) were great! There wasn't a lot though, and it was a bit expensive haha. I liked the smoked salmon ones the best. The quiche was good, and it came with a scone as well I believe. To no fault of the owners or cooks, though, the egg and cheese ensemble became a little overwhelmng. But that's on me, I can't have too much of a dairy product without it becoming some kind of alien texture in my mouth and disgusting me. But before that set in, it was quite delicious and rich! There was a lot of Queen Elizabeth paraphernalia all over the place and it was very decorated, not enough to be gaudy, but definitely cute. If you live out near carefree or just want to experience the closest you can to an English High Tea, then I do recommend this place. It's cute, the food is good, and they have a little box of hats to wear while you're there!"}
{"text":"Very cute place.  Perfect place to take your mom, (which i did while she was visiting from Canada, eh?).     Of couse you MUST do the high tea: consists of a awesome display of a large 3-tiered plated presentation of tiny goodies.  Little smoked salmon sandwiches, cucumber & cream cheese, scones, jam, tiny petite fours.  I love scones and clotted cream (devenshire) ours arrived with plain whip cream (totally disappointed).  Very unique place to take a guest, just hope your server is in a happier mood for you, otherwise would have given the extra star for star treatment :-)"}
{"text":"Pricey and very small portion, but fun experience. We took our toddler with us. It was nice to see 2 other families brought their little ones. Food and cakes were mediocre."}
{"text":"The Harry Potter birthday celebration event here was a most charming tribute to this popular series of youth literature. Much thought, time, expense and effort had gone into the planning, decorations, menu, costumes and execution. There were real owls from the sanctuary, a magician who visited each table, there was a Potter quiz for each table, the owner was a terrific Bellatrix LeStrange, staff were all in costume and clearly enjoying themselves. The menu was tweaked to be all in Potter style and was typically excellently presented, as well as exceptionally toothsome, just as I have come to expect from this Carefree standout. There were \"snitch\" truffles, chocolate frogs, exciting cake pops with crackling space rocks in the frosting, Hagrid's Rock cakes, and their famous scones with clotted cream and the tastiest jam ever. My table chose the cucumber sandwiches - always a treat here, the bread so soft, the filling so cold, delicate and crisp. The place was bustling, with most smiling visitors proudly in costume, and all thoroughly enjoying being in similar company - many photos were being taken and much talk from table to table was joyfully happening.   A visit to this Tearoom on a regular day is a treat, on a themed day it's something very special indeed."}
{"text":"OMG, this is the cutest place in Carefree! I have a 7 year old daughter the insisted on having her birthday at English Rose Tea Room. The wait staff were wonderful and we all got to pick out our \"fancy hats\" before tea was served. The only complaint is that there is not much arm or leg room. However, you can sit outside if you desire more room."}
{"text":"So fun, worth the drive, however, I would have liked it if they had more choices for my 2 girls to choose from (tea wise) as they only have one type of kids tea to choose from. Overall a great place for a girls day!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous time celebrating a friend's birthday at this gem of a place in Carefree.  Who knew that you could be swept away to the UK in one afternoon!  Adorable surroundings, tea that hit the spot and a beautiful display of scones, sweets, and tea sandwiches.  The service was a bit slow because it was so busy, but the owner dropped by our table to say hello, and we were forced to relax and enjoy the afternoon.  Delightful."}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful little gem! We came for high tea, and it was a delight. The tea was delicious. Overall and very enjoyable and unique experience!"}
{"text":"Great place in a serene and peaceful environment in Cave Creek. I have been here multiple times including my birthday and the tea for two never disappoints. Lovely hosts , from the UK myself its a nice comfort to hear some more of the accent and eat some familiar foods out here in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My daughters love this place, and every time my sister comes to visit me she wants to come here. The food is good (albeit expensive; it was $100 for a lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids) and the decor is really beautiful. My girls love the wide array of hats! Be warned that it's pretty small and cramped, so when it's full you can feel a bit claustrophobic. But it's a really nice experience."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this tea room. The food (salads, quiche, scones) are all very good along with the tea. My problem with the tea room is the prices. I feel they charge more than they should for what you're getting. This to me is a special occasion \"girl's\" luncheon place and not for many men due to menu selection and portion sizing."}
{"text":"The place is worth the visit. Loved everything about it. A real gem in Carefree. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Joan and her team make this not a restaurant to eat at but a destination to make. We willingly and excitedly travel nearly 100 miles round trip to eat here and immerse ourselves in a slice of the best England has to offer. When in Carefree or in Phoenix for that matter and want to experience the finest of Britain, don't fly away drive to there English Rose Tea Room."}
{"text":"The English Rose Tea Room definitely gets my \"Four and Three-Fourths Stars\". A  wonderful experience from beginning to end.  The ambiance is outstanding, especially the full-size cut-out of Queen Elizabeth II, with a real hat on her head.  Except for three issues, I would give the E.R.T.R. a solid five stars.    These issues all have to do with the food served for High Tea. With a just little inexpensive tweaking, my issues would be resolved. The first is the tea sandwiches. All but the chicken salad sandwiches could be tweaked to taste better. The cucumber sandwiches were made of bread, cream cheese and a slice of cucumber. There are recipes for English Cucumber Sandwiches that add things like onions and other herbs to the cream cheese that greatly enhance these finger sandwiches.  Also, the cucumber flavor is greatly enhanced if the cucumbers are soaked for a short period in salt water.  The smoked salmon sandwiches were only some Philadelphia Cream Cheese (smoked salmon flavored) between two slices of rye bread. So much more could be done for this bland sandwich by using some dill or capers for example. The other food that was disappointing was the petit fours.  They were dried out and not appetizing. Take the loss on this food, and serve fresh cake. All of the fruits and chocolate dipped strawberries were perfection in its self.  The scones were to die for.  Now that we have the complaints out of the way, let us sing the praises of this wonderful tea room.  The staff was total \"five stars\" in meeting our requests and needs.  As for the tea trust me (I drink tea 99.99% of the time) was \"outstanding\".  It was the \"tea of the day\", and a large pot of tea served three of us quite nicely.  If you wish to step out of time and go back to a more gentler and gracious time of living, then the English Rose Tea Room is a \"must\" for you.  Would I go back to the E.R.T.R. again?  Yes, in a heartbeat. Wonderful place."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot to celebrate my adult daughter's BD.  We hoped to sit outside and had the best table there.  Food was difficult to decide upon as the choices were many and sounded so appealing.  We settled on the salad with apples, chicken and stilton cheese and strawberry vinaigrette dressing and the quiche of the day with sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and a cheddar cheese that was scrumptious.  Portion sizes were grand.  We ended our meal with Cream Tea with Lady Grey.  The clotted cream and jam were memorable.  We have a favoriite spot for tea in England by the name of Raffles in Hartney Wintney, GB.  This brought back many memories of time spend in another country.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The place is super cute! If you want to get in touch with some British culture this is the place to go. Tea is amazing and the scones are really good. I would give this place 5 stars however what dropped it down is the customer service. I was there for my birthday with the ladies after an hour of being there we were forced to pay and leave. We stepped outside and took a picture and finished with our conversation. The owner came out and asked to go to park and chat if we wanted to but not in front of her tea room. We paid good amount for the experience and for us not once but twice to be told to leave is unacceptable. I get if you are busy but that type of service is not ok."}
{"text":"Went back a year later and still just as lovely as the last time, or may I say even better. Service was very fast and the earl grey tea is fabulous. Coming to the Tea room has become a new tradition of mine."}
{"text":"What a great way to spend the morning! We just had a group of 27 ladies enjoy a morning of the Royal Wedding Tea, scones, tea sandwiches and great conversation. My experience at the English Rose Tea Room is certainly a memorable one! Thank you Jo for making the ladies feel like royalty!"}
{"text":"Adorable place!! Went for Mother's Day and had a blast!! Delicious scones, salad, and read!!! Really great food! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The CUTEST place! I love coming here! I studied abroad in England and this is the ONLY place in Arizona where I can satisfy my craving for a good scone--and Devon cream! The staff here is always lovely and cheerful, the atmosphere is adorably British, and the place is always packed with people having tea parties and cute lunches. Love me those scones and sandwiches--and the tea is to die for! Super classy, unique place: I highly recommend the Afternoon Tea tray. A little pricey but worth it for a fun experience!"}
{"text":"Today was the 1st time I ever attended this establishment. Read previous reviews and had very high expectations based on what I read. This place did NOT disappointment. The food? 5 stars. The atmosphere/ambiance? 5 stars. The staff was helpful, courteous and always smiling. This place recreates an authentic feel to English Tea Service. The prices? Not expensive at all. Worth the 45-minute drive from Mesa. Don't forget your hat:-)"}
{"text":"This is the best experience ever! This was our first visit and we went with friends. It was completely enjoyable and wonderful. They have a great selection of teas and the tiered selections are amazing. The petit fours were delicious, the crumpets were fantastic and when you add the clotted cream and strawberry jam you'll never want to eat any other crumpet type breads without it. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about every item on the menu. They even have hats that you can borrow to make the experience more Britishesque.  The only thing I could do without was the cucumber sandwiches, not to my liking at all. But, everything else was completely fantastically wonderful!"}
{"text":"If you want to tap into your  girly side then grab your bestie and your best hat (optional) and enjoy the English Tea room. A very quaint , lovely place with delightful food and tea. You won't be sorry . Don't take my word for it try it out for yourself !!!"}
{"text":"If you want to be transported to an enchanted place and step away from the hustle and bustle of the world, go to the English Rose Tea Room.  I've been here so many times, including my own Bridal Shower, this place feels like home to me.  Having never been to England, I imagine myself there each time I have tea sitting on the patio of this wonderful place.  My Husband and I went here this weekend (yes he loves it too), and have a lovely pot of Paris tea (my favorite), scones with cream and jam, and lunch entrees.  He had the savory bread pudding and I had the tea sandwiches and soup.  The food here is always great, as is the service.  It's a nice and relaxing place to people watch or have a good conversation with the person you are with.  I can't say enough about this gem.  Go there, even if you are a guy, don't be afraid, you will LOVE it!"}
{"text":"What a gem in Carefree! We live not too far from here and always take out of town friends and family here for a little treat. Having had high tea in England many times with British friends, I'd say this place is pretty much on par with those."}
{"text":"Went for my daughters birthday.  Adorable setting....they have hats and dress up things to borrow.  VERY close quarters which was a little awkward as we sat next to two ladies discussing dates.   But the beautiful tea cups and plates and all the frou frou on the walls gave us conversation.  They brought one glass of water, even though there were three of us....eventually came back with 2 more....then the other server brought three waters, lol....not very organized as to who was doing what throughout our entire visit, but at least we had lots of attention!   Food was plentiful, but not very special.  The bread for the sandwiches were all store bought (you could tell by the texture and flavor, or lack of), the chicken was flavorless, but the salmon made up for it.   The scones were very nice....they didn't have devon cream so we got some tasteless whipped stuff, but the jelly was flavorful.   The desserts however were awful.  Anytime you had a sweet loving child a desserts and she takes one bite and doesn't want any more....you know it's bad.  There were 5 (maybe 6) different kinds of sweet and none of us liked any of them.  All you could taste was sugar, no flavor it was so sickeningly sweet.  And believe me we love sweets.....went later that night to Claim Jumpers for Motherlode Chocolate Cake to make up for not eating any sweets with tea!.   There was a nice assortment of tea choices, and we did like our teas, but all you get is a tiny pot, advertised as 2-3 cups, but none of us got a full 3rd cup in our little china cups.  We were glad for the water!   I told them when I made the reservation that it was for a birthday, reminded her when ordered, and my daughter didn't even get a Happy Birthday greeting.  Yet a table with 4 adult ladies got a treat with a candle and a quick little song.   Oh well, WE sang happy birthday to her at the tea and again over cake with the Claim Jumpers staff joining in.    All in all a little disappointing.  We've done afternoon tea all over the USA....travelling with hubby we go everywhere we can find one.   Most of the small tea shops in Phoenix are gone....Kimberly's in Glendale is such rude staff I'll never go back, this one had friendly staff but \"eh\" food.....the others we have enjoyed in the last 3 years are gone, so I guess we either hit the big hotel teas (which aren't usually as much fun, though the food is usually great) or we drive down to Tucson for one of our top 5 in the country.....Chantilly."}
{"text":"Incredible food and tea. I love their shepherds pie and any of their soups. Their spa tea is so comforting pr if you like black teas, get the black current - yum! They have delicious scones with amazing cream and jam. I just love this place. The decor makes you feel like you are in a quaint tea shop in England and if it raining out, you want to stay on this place for hours. The gals that serve you are always kind and allow you to take your time. This is a very special place to me and my mom. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful Mother's Day tea.  The preset menu offered an abundance of food as we were told by our five star server!  To start, we we offered our choice of tea including a special mother's day blend.  The apricot fruit tea was delightful even as my default choice because there was no white teas offered.  The mushroom/brie cream cup of soup was delicious served hot.   The petite salad with mixed berries in balsamic dressing was enjoyable until my daughter found a large pecan in her requested nut free salad!  (Nut allergy, yikes!)   The roasted chicken with tarragon on walnut bread was good, the smoked salmon with cream cheese filling sandwich was okay  but the orange mint butter in the cucumber tea sandwich was a miss.   Their scones accompanied with Devonshire cream and strawberry preserves were fantastic though!  All five of us agreed that this was the highlight of our tea!  Not to say that the desserts such as the sponge cake/ lemon almond tartlet or lavender short bread cookies were not divine......just the scones were superior to any other scones I've had."}
{"text":"I brought my sister in law and two young nieces in today for lunch and could not be more thrilled with the service or food.  I didn't think to make a reservation (next time I will for sure) but they were very accommodating and squeezed is in. The owner even took time to chat with my niece about her imaginary horse friend Galahand.  The atmosphere was perfection and you can even take a picture with Queen Elizabeth herself. I will certainly return. Lobed every second."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place with a passion! I have been going here for about 3 years and always finding myself wanting to make the 1 hour and 20 minute trip to get there just to eat their delicious food and sip their wonderful tea. Here is a break down of what I love most about the tea house and what could be improved!  Pros: -Their food is legit English food and the tiers are so cute! -The decoration and atmosphere is amazing. -The owner is actually British and goes to England often to find new things for the shop, so she knows what she is doing. -The selection of tea fits almost every pallet. -There is a cute shop next door that sells antiques!  Cons: -It's quite a drive since it is tucked in the corner of Carefree. -The menu is extensive but a bit pricey.  -Seems there need to be more waitresses. -Gets a litte crowded since the space is so small and there are alot of people. Noise tends to sometimes be an issue as well.  All in all it is a great place and you should definitely check it out if you are a tea/dessert lover! Long live the queen!"}
{"text":"I love tea houses!  I just wish there were more in the Valley.  This one is a long drive from the Phoenix area, but worth it if you love tea.  Make a reservation because the space is very small."}
{"text":"The loveliest tea room - possibly in the WORLD!  A great way to start off the New Year. From the moment you enter, you are surrounded by charming British touches. The owner certainly knows how to present a proper British tea. Everything was delightful! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My only complaint about this wonderful experience is that you have to drive 20 miles out of Phoenix into the desert to get there.   In fact, one starts out by wondering how and why this tea room is located at the ends of the earth.  Turns out the owner moved to Phoenix from England 16 years ago and couldn't find a good cup of tea. So......and she;s still there greeting guests at the door.  The ssetting and service are charming and friendly.   Background music from the 1930s and 1940s plays quietly, so that you could imagine being in one of those old black and white movies about London in the late 1940s.  We ordered Earl Grey tea and a tray of petit sandwiches, scones with Devon cream and strawberry jam, and tasty desserts (macaroons, slice of cake, other delights).  It was all quite tasty and pleasant.   Part of the appeal is the real China cups and trays, the wall adornments and the cutout posters of the Queen Mother, Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle.  Sorry to say, they will be sold out on the wedding day.    If you are a tea fancier, take the drive (other than at rush hour) and enjoy.  This place recently appeared in a national listing of the top ten tea rooms in the US, and the rating is justified."}
{"text":"Family went here for Grandma's birthday. Not a ton of room here but we made due and had a fun time. Lots of cute hats and headwear for the kids to dress up in. Eclectic decor throughout. We tried a sample tray and the variety was good, everything tasted fresh. We tried the Paris tea and even the guys who don't drink tea enjoyed it. Service was very good and friendly. I believe it was either the owner or manager stopped by our party several times to check in on us. We had a lot of fun!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite places to eat ever! The food is great and the decorating is so cute. I love the soup, sandwiches, and scones with jelly and cream. Yum!! Paris tea is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Adorable tea room...amazing place for high tea with girlfriends!! The Paris tea is the most delicious tea I've ever had! This is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I loved loved LOVED my experience at the English Rose. A large group of friends and I made reservations of a large (~25 person) group to celebrate an event and they were extremely accommodating to us, especially with how crowded it was. Me and my friend were even a little late, and though we had to stand for our table to open up, she was great about getting us seared with our large party as soon as she could (I believe some other worker had accidentally given our table away).   The tea (caramel peach herbal tea) was the best I've ever had and I am hooked- I had never been to an afternoon tea before and it was all delicious. Finger sandwiches, desserts, and fresh scones with jam and delicious cream.  It's quite a drive from Gilbert but I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  I took my daughter here for her 5th birthday since she loves tea parties and this place did not disappoint.  They even turned off all the lights in the whole place to come and sing happy birthday to her.  They made her feel like a princess.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"It was like I stepped into the world of Alice in Wonderland. The theme was of course, an English Tea room with beautiful decor such as crystal chandeliers with flowers and tea cups hanging off them. The tables were beautifully set up with white table cloths and tea sets as you walked in. We got seated and had some time to take a look at the menu. We  ordered an order of sandwiches with desserts and scones. The little cucumber sandwiches were very nice. The desserts were delicious and got served with Devon cream and jam.  There were also chocolate dipped strawberries and other little desserts sprinkled throughout. There was a very large variety of Teas which got served in little white tea pots. The whole experience was wonderful. There is also an outside patio with curtains and lots of seating. Even though it was very crowded on a Sunday, the service was very good. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for a girls tea party. We did our bridal shower here. Fabulous food. Everything was so delicious and we had so much fun getting dressed up and wearing hats."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the English Rose Tea Room on a rainy day, and it was almost like being in London. The dining room was charmingly decorated with numerous crystal chandeliers, cozy nooks, fancy tables and chairs, and many interesting items to view and buy if desired. The service was friendly and attentive, the teas were delicious, and the generous servings of sandwiches, scones, and pastries were beautifully displayed and tasted as wonderful as they looked.  There were so many treats to savor that we brought a good portion home and enjoyed them the next day. I would definitely recommend the English Rose Tea Room as an authentic and scrumptious example of the real afternoon tea experience."}
{"text":"First time back here in long time. Today the server didn't see me at my corner table so I had to wait a bit to get water & my order in but she was very sweet & accommodating of my time constraint.  I can't wait to eat my scones & drink some tea!! The food, tea, service & ambiance are always wonderful! Everyone should. come here at least once! Great place to bring your out of town (female) guests for a leisurely English tea experience."}
{"text":"This place is so unique and so cute. The tea and pastry tier tower were delicious. Costumer service was great."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of my boss I decided to put in a reservation for afternoon tea for my husband and I. He is always telling me he'd love to do something like this. It was awesome! We arrived and were seated in the coziest little table. The place was very detailed in its decor. The three tier tower of treats was very appropriate. And the Tea, we had a Black Rose tea which was their special that day and it was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe in a quaint outdoor shopping district. They let us buy some blueberry scones to go which are perfect with coffee or their apricot tea. You walk in and you feel the elegance. Would love to come back to this place in the winter time when I'm in the mood for warm tea!"}
{"text":"What a delightful place! I brought a visiting friend here when she wanted to experience something different after I showed her around the Valley for several days. We decided to do the high tea (as recommended by Linda R's review here in yelp). My friend chose a lavander-blended tea and I had the peach-ginger tea -- two extraordinarily fragrant and delicious choices that went so well with the cakes, sandwiches, scones, and cookies in the 3-tiered server. The elegant meal (yes, I think it should be considered a meal) and the beautiful surroundings made our trip to Carefree so much more memorable.  (Note: English Rose Accents is a gift shop located next door to the English Rose Tea Room. For that, see http://www.yelp.com/biz/english-rose-accents-carefree)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to enjoy a fun outing here, but the experience was very underwhelming. Everyone working there is very nice and charming, but the ambiance wasn't enjoyable and overall the food was so so. We came in on a Saturday afternoon with a reservation, and were seated at a small cramped table. Everything inside is close together and crammed together - it ended up feeling really claustrophobic. The acoustics make it much louder than normal restaurants.   We got the multi tiered food platter with scones, sandwiches, and desserts plus two tea pots. Our tea was served and the server said to let them steep for 5 minutes, then 30 seconds she was back pouring them. One of the tea pots spilled all over, which she said they were trying to get rid of those ones (trying, really? you can just do it), and she didn't clean up any of the big puddles left behind. The sandwiches weren't anything special, the desserts were average, but the scones and jam was  good.   The outside of the tea room is much more charming and open than the inside. Perhaps on a weekday the experience is more enjoyable when it's less crowded. If I find myself back in the area and in need of a snack, some scones seated outdoor would be the way to go."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I can't wait to go back.  It is such a girly place.  I think the day we went there were absolutely no men, I guess it would be a little intimidating for them, but there is nothing wrong, I think I will bring my hubby next time, haha.  We were nine women and had a fairly large table reserved for us.  We all donned hats and enjoyed the quaint place so much.  I had the Pear, Brie and Cranberry salad.  It was delicious.  We had a wonderful tea, I don't remember the name.  I am going to put this place in my rotation for birthdays or just girly time.  It is so darling."}
{"text":"Loved this quaint English Tea House! The owner was extremely friendly, as well as the staff. They made sure everything was tasty and we enjoyed ourselves.  There are fun hats to wear which adds to the experience. We sat on the patio which I'd recommend, since the inside tables seemed a little cramped. Decor is fun and unique.  They have a great variety of teas to choose from as well as lunch items. My sister and I were able to share a small afternoon tea tier between the two of us.  My only qualm was the tables were too small for me. I had a difficult time fitting at them (I'm 6'5\"). I felt slightly like a misplaced giant in a fairy tale."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time here!  Myself, my mother, and two guests were able to fit quite well in the outside patio.  It was a nice open atmosphere, the cutest decorations, and lovely china.  My best friend and I had the quiche and it was delicious, as well as a nice portion size with the salad that came with it.  And the tea, oh my goodness. It was so good."}
{"text":"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. From the service, to the very fresh food, our experience was fabulous. Warm bread, fresh cream, great salads and quiche. We enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 26th birthday here. Such a fun, amazing, lovely, wonderful place. I could go on and on. There was 25 of us and we all had the time of our lives laughing, drinking tea and baby sandwiches. Thank you for great memories and great service! I'll keep sending the love!"}
{"text":"So cute!!  The details this tea room has really make this place great.  Everything tasted great, I only felt like the prices were a liiiiitle high, but then again, how often do we treat ourselves to tea?!  I would say I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"I adore this place! I have been here 3 times and I'll definitely be back. It's honestly all for the experience. When you walk in its a tight little space that reminds you of your grandmother's home, with the antique looking tea pots and beautiful furniture to its peaceful vibe. It's pink, bright and girly. It's a perfect place for a bridal shower or casual brunch!"}
{"text":"It is always a treat to visit the English Rose Tea Room in Carefree. It's never too far a drive to enjoy afternoon tea, scones, tea sandwiches or a delicious dish. The setting is wonderful, the decor unique and fun, and the servings delicious. A little bit of Britain in the desert!"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  There is a big box of hats and customers can chose and wear one while having tea.  It is so fun!  Feels like Downton Abbey.  It's very crowded - lots of tables and merchandise in a small space, but it seems to work.  The tea is great and the food accompanying it is good - scones, little sandwiches, macaroons - it's all there.  I recommend this place because it's fun!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit the English Rose Tea Room for afternoon tea for years and finally made a reservation for my husband, dog and myself yesterday.  We were seated at a lovely table on the patio and had such a nice experience.  My husband had the garden vegetable soup and an apple, chicken and blue cheese salad.  I enjoyed the Just Desserts menu of scones with strawberry preserves and some petit fours with a small pot of red vanilla tea - so very tasty!    Such a relaxing and elegant experience tucked away in quaint Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place for tea with girlfriends or your daughter. Make sure to call ahead and reserve"}
{"text":"Such a cute & wonderful tea house !! Took my daughter to the nutcracker tea the past couple years. Such a fun tradition. There pastries are delicious & the tea is wonderful."}
{"text":"The prettiest and most quaint English Tea Room around! I stumbled upon this quaint little vintage tea room whilst driving through to a Business meeting and couldn't pass by afterwards without checking it out. Being English,I thought I'd be their best critic but the tea shop is run by an English Family.From the flamboyant flowers and hanging tea pot chandeliers,the tea shop greets you with absolute charm.Upon entering the tea shop,you are surrounded with English memorabilia about the Monarchy.The tables are set as they would be in England,tea is loosely served and everything comes with a proper English saucer (side plate). The food is exceptional,everything tastes as it would back home in England.I had the Duchess of Bedford's Formal Afternoon Tea for 1 and it was delicious! From the Walnut crusted bread to the lavender cream cheese,the clotted cream and raspberry jam scones to the macaroons- this English hidden little gem will not disappoint. If you want a traditional English treat,you have to visit this place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I almost didn't want to write a review, because I want to keep it my own little secret.  While visiting my cousin in Phx. last April, I decided to drive out to cave creek/carefree and stumbled upon the quaintest tea shop. I was lucky and went mid week, and got in without a reservation.  I had the Just Dessert Tea. The pastries were all delicious and tempting. The scone was perfect, and real Devon cream. A little slice of English heaven in the middle of the desert.  Best of all was the ladies working, they were all very courteous and patient and kind. They were helpful in picking out a tea and made a lone traveler feel very welcome.  I plan on coming back next spring, I'm even sending my Aunt out there next week."}
{"text":"I invited my daughter and her out-of-town friend here for a tea date about a year or so ago.  I have to admit that I was a bit UNDERwhelmed.  However, I am a little spoiled from after my very first \"high tea\" at London's Four Seasons Inn On The Park, then the St. Regis in Washington DC.  BUT, after all, this is Carefree Arizona, not Hyde Park!  Accordingly this place hits the mark for its locale.  The atmosphere is lovely with nice shabby chic touches throughout.  The tables are packed in a bit tight and the service could be a great deal faster and attentative.  The teas are excellent and scones are lovely.  We had the Duchess of Bedford Afternoon Tea - the proper title includes the word \"Formal\" but it is just the kind of offering at any pedestrian English tea establishment. The cakes and sweets on the top tier are just average.  My main complaint is that the tea sandwiches taste like they had been frozen and recently thawed out.  Ours were a bit icy on the inside and tasted of the fridge.    That said, I'd like to host a small baby shower for my daughter soon, providing the packed in seating will accommodate 12 to 16 women, along with the flurry of gift-giving.   The ambience of this restaurant negates many of the cons."}
{"text":"Everything about this Tea Room is perfect!  From the food to the ambiance to the service to the tea itself, you will think just indulged in High Tea with the Queen!  In fact, have your picture taken with the Queen in one of their fancy hats.  What a wonderful experience!  We really felt like we were on vacation!  Everyone should experience this bright spot in Carefree!  There is nothing else like it short of a trip to England!"}
{"text":"The place is adorable! My girlfriends and I dressed up and had a blast having an adult tea party. The only downside was the service.. we waited forever to get more tea."}
{"text":"I have to admit, this place is cute.   You'll feel like you walked into Buckingham Palace for a spot of tea with the Queen, herself. I usually order the soup and sandwich selection which includes a small cup of selected soup accompanied by 3 miniature sandwiches. Each is cut into two smaller halves. They are all refreshingly light and unique. If you've got a bigger appetite, check out the Cottage Pie. That mashed potato crust is going to leave you more than satisfied.   The tea experience is incredible here. The Cinnamon flavor is my favorite. It comes with rich cream and sugar on the side. One lump or two? Also, be sure to leave room for a dessert scone: Powdered sugar, warm, tears apart and melts in your mouth deliciousness served with strawberry preserve and cream.  Fellas, \"tea time\" shouldn't be reserved for golf courses. If you're in the area and want to try something different, check this place out. Call ahead because they fill up quick!"}
{"text":"I love this tea room! We are fortunate to have such an excellent establishment so close to where we live. There are excellent options for those who are gluten free. I would recommend any of the Baker's Jackets. I think the \"closeness\" of the interior adds to the ambiance. The service is usually excellent. These ladies are busy! My 5 year old loves this place as much as I do. I plan on going as often as I can."}
{"text":"Its so English, Girly,Dreamy, Vintage. You gotta try thier Paris tea for sure. It was so comforting. I and my comrade went along. She and I ordered Creme Tea  which includes :  1.Smal Pot of your Favorite Tea 2. Homemade Scones 2 in quantity 3. Strawberry Reserve  4.Devon Cream (its not sweet) and Jelly  We did little variation by ordering Large Tea with one Flavor i.e Paris Tea. Our Total was $15 and We tipped 5 Dollars for good service and greeting. Our Servers Beverly,who served Tea & Mindy who served Scones were very kind and ever smiling, and very polite. Very welcoming experience with perfect decor in a PINK WORLD. It defintely induces feel good facor. EPIC. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE !  Thanks for the royalty :-) Yelpers check this Pink World."}
{"text":"This tea room is a gem!   I have only been here a few times because I live about 35 minutes away, but I manage the trip least once a year.  It is extremely girly with tables interspersed among all things English, tea related, and frilly.  Lots of women and girls wear fancy hats while sipping delicious tea.  My daughter took me there for Mother's Day and we sat outside on the patio for high tea.  Even though it was 100 degrees outside, the patio was pleasant.  We had a fixed menu of soup, salad, finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and a variety of small desserts.  WOW!  Everything was delicious!  Needless to say, I couldn't eat anything else for the rest of the day.  Thank goodness we found the English Rose Tea Room because other tea rooms in the Phoenix area have closed during the recession.  I was afraid that I would have to visit England to get my  \"afternoon tea\" fix, but all is well in Cave Creek.  Put on your fanciest hat, grab every female friend you can find, and head to this English oasis in the middle of the Old West."}
{"text":"We have been going to English Rose Tea Room for 10 years. It is about an hour away from us so we try to make the trip 1-2 times a year, when we can. The staff is friendly, the food is amazing (their tea and scones, yum!) and Jo (owner) always tries to make it around to all of the tables. She is from England and it is always a joy to talk to her. I have not written a review before now because I don't typically think to write reviews, but as I sit in my kitchen eating my leftover scones and drinking my tea, a smile comes to my face. The scones are still \"yum!\" the next day, and the memories and how English Tea Rose makes you feel every time you visit is well worth the drive. It's high time I write a review and share it with others, don't you think?  And guys... it's one of my husband's favorite places to go too. :)"}
{"text":"Super cute little tea room. As a guy I was not comfortable but my wife was and we had a nice time. The munchies were good and all the little girls having tea parties were too cute. Not my style but they are doing a cool thing there."}
{"text":"My daughter was here for Mother's Day and we decided to host a little Tea Party for the Ladies!! We had been here exactly 4 years earlier for Mother's Day as well! It's such a Special Gem that adds Charm to any event. The menu is Perfect for a light nibble. Soup is darling tea cups, petite salads on the tea saucer. An abundance of tea choices for all tea enthusiasts! Sweet little sandwiches and biscuits with Jam & sweet cream!! The ambiance is what truly is the Charmer!! If you have an event for ladies or little ladies...this is a delightfully fancy good time!! Well done"}
{"text":"A most delightful and charming tea room, it's a true taste of \"home.\"    The perfect place to go for a refined afternoon tea particularly with a few of your best girlfriends, wear your prettiest dress and a stylish hat is a must.    Relax and enjoy an array of exquisite little sandwiches, salad, a delicious traditional Ploughman's lunch are just a few of the choices on the menu.  The desserts ( the best part ;)  ) include scones with jam and proper clotted cream imported from England.  The owner, Jo, has become a popular local celebrity round these parts and is a genuinely lovely person who has brought a little bit of that Green and Pleasant Land  to the heart of the desert in beautiful Carefree, Arizona."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our trip to the English Rose Tea Room AFTER a party of two mothers and their four young daughters left. The children were allowed to run and play throughout the restaurant. They destroyed the atmosphere that we had expected. Neither the parents nor the restaurant staff ever said a single word to these out of control moppets. The children used the hat room as their play pen. We also questioned the idea of how \"healthy\" it is to allow the public to share hats - the quickest way I know to spread lice! Our lunch was ordinary but not great and the staff is incredibly slow. The noise is the room was deafening.  I did love the d√©cor and the tea ( passion fruit) was fabulous. We loved the gift shop and bought a teapot and a few teas and commemoratives for the royal baby. A pleasant afternoon but a place that could make some small changes for the better."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now - once with my mother and 18 year old niece and once with my 22 year old daughter and I will continue to bring family and friends.  The decor is lovely and the food wonderful.  I have never had such a scrumptious cottage pie and the 'Nursery Tea' was so cute (and good).  I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Quaint, cute, delicious, but quite cramped and service left a bit to be desired. Had a wonderful time though. First time at a tea room.  The restaurant is decorated very cute, however it is very small and cramped. It was difficult to get in and out. The gift shop area is right inside the door so it's a traffic jam. They actually have a small table they seat people at right inside the doorway.  I would be mortified to be seated there.  The rest of the restaurant is quite small and cramped but it's adorably decorated.  Our server didn't discuss the menu or give us any insight into the menu, tea options or suggestions which was disappointing because we had never been there.  She didn't check in on us but a few times. It was busy, but didn't feel like we got much attention.  That being said, the food is delicious!! The sconces and quiche was to die for. The savory ham and cheese bread pudding was great as well. The tea was wonderful chocolate almond was tea of the day and was delicious.  We had a great time. But we are a patient group.  I would absolutely come back to this tearoom. But I think there is some room for improvement in the experience offered."}
{"text":"The English Rose Tea room is just the nicest experience of a \"bit of England\". They have decorated with tea pots and plates. The food is divine esecially the daily made vanilla scones with cream and jam. My favorite. Its not just for females so check it out."}
{"text":"Do you feel like taking an afternoon trip to have high tea with the Queen? What's that you say? You can't find time in your day to hop on a plane to the United Kingdom? Well that's quite all right because I have the next best option right in our own desert backyard. I am talking about the one and the only royal experience at the English Rose Tea Room in none other than Cave Creek Arizona.   I will just start by saying that the website and pictures don't do this little afternoon tea house any justice. Think of the English Rose Tea Room like the perfect haven for ladies who lunch. The ambiance is fit for a Queen. It's girly, it's cozy and it's adorable, almost like a magical elf's cottage. The woman who runs this tea room is English herself which makes the experience that much more enjoyable. As you walk in, a quaint outdoor patio greets you and once inside, shelves line the walls with every type of tea and tea accessory imaginable. Oh and let's not forget about the Queen herself welcoming you inside (or a cut-out, but we're playing imagination here). Behind the panels lies an intimate tea room where ladies and their guests lunch or have afternoon tea. Hats? Yes there are plenty of hats all around. Did you forget your hat? Well that's ok because there's a basket full ready to be loaned out for the occasion.   Moving on to the tea experience itself, well it's really quite charming. The menu ranges from basic lunch items such as quiche, chicken salad sandwiches and salads to afternoon tea items where you can order the entire Afternoon Tea ($24.99 a person) or you can pick and choose from an a la carte menu. Because my Mom and I had waited so long to try the English Rose Tea Room and we went to celebrate her belated birthday, we ordered a feast fit for a Queen. We first started by sharing the half English salad split for two which was a perfectly fresh salad of greens, raspberries, candied pecans and a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. Following our salad, the Afternoon Tea for two appeared in front of our very eyes! This three-tier meal was accompanied by our choice of tea. We decided to go with the apricot and enjoyed every last sip of not one but two pots! The tea was so delicious you don't need sugar or cream either. The three-tier tea included 6 mini sandwiches a piece (2 cucumber, 2 chicken salad & 2 salmon), two very large (and scrumptious) scones topped w/ powdered sugar and many mini desserts to finish off the meal. My favorite items were the chicken salad tea sandwich, the salmon tea sandwich and the scone. The desserts were decent but the scone really stole the sweet-filled show.   This is a truly delightful place to spend a lazy afternoon when you have nothing but time. Don't visit expecting to be in and out for a quick lunch. No, tea is meant to be savored and you can absolutely do that at this perfectly tealightful restaurant."}
{"text":"I have made a reservation for 43 of my lady friends. I talked to the owner of the restaurant in person, several times and on the phone and planned the event to fine details. Everything was perfect.  Morning of, not afternoon, first thing in the morning I called the restaurant to let them know that 4 of my guests were not going to make it back in town and as a result will not attend my event. I was assured that it will not be a problem and that the server will relate the message to the owner. Owner was not available at the time.  Here are my honest complains that I even wanted to tell the owner know but she refused to listen:  I was told, without even asking that for a reservation of 40 guests  1.The restaurant will be reserved and available for us  from 3pm to 5:30pm  2. I have called to give a final number of guests to avoid being overcharged 3. The attitude of the owner was NOT  acceptable! Here is what happened:  1.The restaurant was NOT ready for us at 3pm. It was more like 3:30 pm.  I did not say anything at the time 2. The restaurant was NOT closed for the public which resulted me personally and others to sit on a patio chair, very uncomfortable, ....my reservation was not for outside but inside!!!   3. I was still charged for the maximum guest which means that pretty much the fact that I called with a final number of guest attending did not make a difference for the owner, of course it meant less money in her packet!! I was told that she did the shopping for the restaurant and that was it!!! what is that supposed to mean? 4.I was also told that she was there  to wash her dishes late and therefore there is not a refund for the overcharge !! what is that suppose to mean? I asked, am I supposed to cover out of my pocket the  charge, after bringing her business and great business in her restaurant !?! .....and that was pretty much it! The owner only cared for her profit, pocket and NO COSTUMER SERVICE! Hello, we are in the USA here:)  5.The hats are gross and a mess and I asked if she plans to have more or in better condition for the event and I was told that they are donated and that she is open for more donations! lol my guests all had their own hats!!! If health department will look at the hats, they may have something to say about their condition and weather they are safe for the public use...  The place is small but nicely decorated, food great, and staff great but having this experience left me in a position that I told the owner, I will make sure all my guest, and more know of  her restaurant, she does not deserve our money, we pay her bills!!! and her employees by being there! Her response was : IT IS YOUR CHOICE ."}
{"text":"We brought out of town family for afteernoon tea recently and were very disappointed. We have been to afternoon tea here before, but unfortunately each time it has progressively declined to the point that after the recent visit, we won't be back.  We made a reservation, however, our table was not ready for us. The owner is rude and we witnessed her being rude to people walking in looking for a table. The food was old and stale, i.e., the bread for finger sandwiches was dry and had been sitting out, the finger cakes were dried out and stale. The focus has become about how many people they can squeeze in the small space with the tables being so close that you are literally sitting shoulder to shoulder with people at next table or you can barely pull your chair out to sit down because the table and person behind you are so close. This place has lost its charm and quality with too much focus on volume and getting as many in as possible. Afternoon tea was over $100 and the experience and food was nothing short of awful. They need to spend more time on quality and less on how many tables and people they can get in a day."}
{"text":"What a fantastic celebration of Harry Potter! We thoroughly enjoyed all the effort you went to to transport us to Harry's world. The decor, the staff and of course the food, were fabulous. Thanks again for such a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to visit this place for a while. Wanting to celebrate Mother's Day here, but the place was already booked both Saturday and Sunday, so I made a reservation on a Thursday afternoon. The atmosphere was very quaint, homey and the decoration was true to its name \"English Rose Tea Garden\".  There were two adults and two kids, so we ordered quite a bit of food. We got Duchess of Bedford Formal Afternoon Tea (petit fours, scones, tea sandwiches and a pot of specially blended black tea: English rose petals), soup & scone (butternut cream soup with homemade cheddar & dill scone), smoked salmon quiche, Hampshire chicken salad (diced chicken breast mixed with dijon mustard, mayonnaise, grapes, celery & mandarin orange segments on a bed of mixed greens and topped with toasted almonds) and Baker's jacket (slow baked Idaho potato served with a side of salad of mixed greens, tomatoes, celery & cucumber and with potato filling of tuna salad, dill pickles and mayonnaise). Everything was delicious.  The service from making the reservation to the end was splendid. All the staff was friendly and full of smiles. Overall, it is a very neat and lovely experience not only for adults, but most certainly for little ladies. A little side note, there are also many hats you can borrow wearing while you dine in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Took my girls for tea time. Great menu and excellent service. The owner was there and she was absolutely delightful. You can tell that she takes great pride in her business."}
{"text":"Pick out the girliest, most floral covered dress you own and put  it on. Make sure it's pink. Next, double check that you have pink nail polish, lipstick and blush. Ok you're all set.  Do you have a mom? Sister? Wife... Daughter... Aunt... Female caregiver...? Are they in the least bit girly and celebrating a birthday or mothers day or divorce or whatever?  This is where you take them.  You sip tea and nibble scones all while surrounded by pictures of the royal family, flowers, dogs, kittens, tea cups and other feminine knick-knacks. And of course, the hats. They have a basket of hats available to borrow for your afternoon tea. Some of them are clearly for little girls and are a little beat up, but there are plenty of nice new ones as well.  The tea menu is extensive and will satisfy any taste, available in small pots and large. I had the English Rose and it was delightfully light and aromatic.   The food offerings allow for both breakfast or lunch with savory and sweet options. And of course save room for the scones. The scones they serve are the highlight. They are served warm with clotted cream and strawberry jam, like in any good English parlor.  After you have had your fill of tea and scones, walk over to their little shop next door. In it you will find jewelry and hats, home decor, soaps and fragrances.  Quite the lovely experience, indeed!"}
{"text":"What a charming place.  my daughter wanted to have a tea party for her birthday but she was too young to go to a five star hotel. Although this place is small, they have everything we need for a tea party.  They offer honey tea (non-caffeinated), lemonade and hot chocolate as a choice of drink for kids.  They have a special afternoon tea menu just for kids.  Kids enjoyed picking their favorite hats to wear during a tea party.  This place is a bit small, once seated, there is not much room to move around.  We ordered Early Grey, Darjeeling, and English Rose Petal Tea. All of them are pretty good.  Food on the other hand was just average.  They weren't too bad but not great either.  I saw other food on the menu (other than afternoon tea three tired tray), and they look good. I don't mind trying them sometimes as I see other's review being good.  We mostly enjoyed the atmosphere, it was as if we were in England or somewhere Southern (Carolina, Georgia.....)  Service was good too.  It was a good introduction to afternoon tea to young girls.  Adults enjoyed nice conversation over tea and sweets.  Our group had five kids and five adults. As this place is small and some of the young children are not patient enough to sit through any longer than 60 mins, I recommend to keep the group small.  This place is not made to carter large group.  That's being said, the owner and servers did really great to carter our needs."}
{"text":"Mmmmm........my afternoon tea did not look like the picture"}
{"text":"This place is darling! We enjoyed the service, food and of course the tea! Our daughter had the nursery tea plate and it was a perfect portion size for her. Wish we lived closer so we could go here more often!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday I had lunch with a group of English ladies. It was great . The place reminded me of a little Devon tea shop or one in the Cotswold . It was perfect. Had a hard time choosing . Settled on the plough mans so good. But the teas looked good to . So I got two scones, jam and cream to take home Mmmmmmm that was my afternoon tea, just like I was in a tea shop back home. Everyone one should try this little bit of England . It's the best. Have a nice British shop next door"}
{"text":"Lovely place for special events or a day with the girls. Food is delicious.would love more salad options."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It is always a fun time and a place I treasure for birthdays and celebrations. So much fun!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends surprise birthday and was impressed by the service and staff. They were helpful in selecting teas and we ordered tea sandwiches and scones (the scones were simple but a big hit with our group) the staff was great and would check in with our group and refill our tea with extra hot water. The place is small but every well decorated and even provide cute vintage tea party hats for your to borrow during your time there. Goes to show you are never too old for a tea party :)"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable! Such a cute, fun experience! There is a nice patio, a gift shop, and then the main dinning area. There are so many details each place you turn, it's impossible to notice every unique item in the tea room! We ordered the formal afternoon tea, which comes with small sandwiches, scones (with cream and jam), and an assortment of little pastries for dessert. It also comes with a pot of tea for $28. We chose the Paris black tea, which enjoyed so much that I bought a container to take home from the gift shop! We ended up ordering more tea sandwiches because we were so hungry. My favorite was the cucumber! The pastries, especially the macaroons, were delicious too! My only complaint is we did feel rushed. They started to want to turn over our table before we were there for an hour. We ended up staying about an hour and a half."}
{"text":"My friend and I took our girls here for tea and we had fun. However, it isn't really kid friendly. It's really tight inside, they put in like 7-8 tables into a small place so when you walk in, you are shoulder to shoulder. The tea and Devon cream is great but everything else is ok. Our kids didn't eat anything, not even the muffins. I would suggest going with adults and leaving the kids behind. Taking out one star because we went for a \"mommy and me\" tea party and we felt it was not very kid friendly."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time here.  warm-hearted service  with lovely decoration.  lots of hat selections in the cloak room.  Reminds me so much of UK.  scone is really tasty but the macaron can be better."}
{"text":"How incredibly cute is this place?  Reservations are highly recommended but you can pop in, just may not have a great seat but there aren't any bad seats.  The menu is amazing, food quality is outstanding.  Service is adorable and prompt.  You cannot go wrong here.  Absolutely every little girl's fantasy and the birthdays ranged from 7-17 while we were eating.  Guys, just bring your ladies and check your man card at the door.  It's ok, you can get it back later with the love and devotion from your ladies.  They will love it.  Check in with the manager Hillary, she loves working here and it shows.  God save the Queen."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is very overrated! I really was expecting so much more. First of all, the price is insane! The lunch entrees were very small - if it wasn't for the $6.50 scone I would have passed out from hunger. At least my mother in law and her mother enjoyed it. I loved the room and decor but it was very small. I think they were short handed - customer service was terrible - the ladies were nice but too slow. I would never go here again. $75 for 4 adults that left hungry. Oh and they say they love to have babies in the restaurant- too bad their highchair is broken and unsafe. Really wished the experience had been better.  :-("}
{"text":"Jo is the sweetest person that you will ever meet! She helped us out during a few of our Grand Opening events and we loved her desserts and pastries! Her tea room is a perfect place where you can sit with friends and have a cup of tea along with delicious food!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was great. I met out of town friends there on a Saturday at 1:30. We had lunch and the Just Desserts tea for dessert. Everything was delicious. The only down side was, after we were barely done, they started cleaning up the dishes and brought the bill. We stayed a few minutes longer, it was about 3:00. The owner came over and asked us to leave because she had people waiting for the table. She said \"I'm not kicking you out, but I am! I have people chomping at the bit for this table\" We were only there an hour and a 1/2, which for a place like this isn't that long, especially to visit and enjoy tea and biscuits. We were all pretty shocked. I've never been asked to leave a place to make room for someone else. I could see if we had been there for hours, but we weren't. I would rather be told on the phone, when I made the reservation, that we had an hour and a half and that was all. I know they are busy, but this seemed a little extreme. I would still go back, just not on a Saturday, way too busy. And now I know not  to over stay my welcome."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has 4+ stars. It is truly a gem of Carefree. I went with a friend, and loved it so much I went back with my mom. Both times we had the formal afternoon tea and it was wonderful.  The Tea Room is so charming, beautifully and elegantly decorated. The service is always great, waitresses are friendly and the owner has been there each time I was there and frequently checks in on tables. There's no pressure to leave either, they are patient and allow you to enjoy your experience. Prices are also very reasonable! Formal tea is only $28 and is more than enough for 2 guests.   I will definitely go back and strongly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for high tea. I always have the best time here. My favorite tea is the jasmine blossom, it taste so smooth like silk in your mouth and I usually order the nursery tier to share.  This place is definitely for girls who wanted to indulge in tea, they have wide varieties of tea from around the world. They have really good ambiance and the minute you enter this restaurant, you feel like you are in England having tea with the queen.  I love that they also provide the pretty hats or tiara to wear during your tea time and of course you have to return it after.  This restaurant is very popular for ladies birthday, baby shower, just have tea for moms & daughters and lately I noticed that some ladies brought their husbands, partners or boyfriends to accompany them.  The food is amazing and the staffs are very sweet. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Our favorite tea and lunch place bar none!  We have been coming here since they opened and always get excellent service. Always feel like royalty when we are there."}
{"text":"Love love love here so much! Who knew I can find such a lovely place in the desert. It's just perfect for ladies who love tea, desserts and tasty food.  I'd love to come back with my friends here again. I had a great time with my companies here :)"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here in February with a friend. We had soup and \"High Tea\". Lots of fun accoutrements and delicious tea. The inside is decorated very frilly with lots of fun accessories and teas to purchase. The owner is British and was very hands-on, asking us how we were doing and even taking orders. Definitely recommend this place, especially in the cooler months so you can enjoy the outside seating."}
{"text":"Beautiful and delicious! A wonderful lo-tech way to spend time with a special person in your life!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite morning getaway for the best tea and scones...ever!  My favorite place to sit is on the patio but the decor inside is so lovely that it's a treat as well.  The staff and owner are very pleasant and attend to every need before you think of it.  I brought a large group of women from my monthly lunch group for a fabulous luncheon. The portions were generous and the food was excellent.   All forty of us enjoyed the afternoon which included a short presentation by the tea leaf reader that we arranged for as well.  We allowed time to browse the lovely gift shop next door and a few of the gals stopped to have their tea leaves read.  Jo, the owner made everything so simple to organize and a real treat for everyone.  I still love my morning stops on my own, but I'd take a large group here again in a heart beat.  It's always a must do spot when friends come to town too.  Carefree is such a lovely place to shop, browse, and enjoy the mixture of mountains and desert scenery.  Adding a visit to The English Rose Tea Room makes the trip just perfect!"}
{"text":"Our grandmother brought my sister and I here when it first opened. I brought my sister back last week and we had a lovely time. Jo, the owner, was very helpful with surprising my sister with a note upon arrival. Tea and 3 tier package were great! Only suggestions are to get rid of some older hats and seat guests on time. I don't remember the place being so overwhelming with trinkets when we last came. I wish I had known about the outdoor patio, which looked perfect for a hot day. Great place to bring your grandchildren or just to dress up with girlfriends!"}
{"text":"This was the first visit to the ERT for me and my friends. I booked the reservation about a month in Advance to celebrate our friend's birthday.  We loved the decor and the food and tea was also delicious.  My friend and I ordered the special for the day which was quiche and a salad. The bottom portion of my quiche and specifically the spinach was still cold so I asked for another plate.  They were accommodating and brought me another which was piping hot and very delicious. Our server asked if we had wanted the bread that accompanies the meal and we said yes; however, it was never brought to our table.  We each enjoyed our individual pots of steaming tea and those were all good (my friends had cinnamon apple, and I the English Rose).  We each ordered dessert and it was good too; however I thought I was getting the custard creme with my blueberry scone but they served it only with butter and jam.  At the end of our meal, we visited the ladies room and while waiting tried on various hats.  That was fun. All and all, we enjoyed our experience and I will probably return again in the future.  A fun place for ladies and little girls."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable and the food and tea was delicious.  I loved posing with the cutout of Queen Elizabeth and we enjoyed everything we ordered, our favorite being the British version of Shepherd's Pie, which I cannot remember the proper name for, but will take a picture.  We will back again, as this is a great town to take guests and a great lunch or tea stop."}
{"text":"We went back today to try the Duchess of Bedford's Formal Afternoon Tea....truly sumptuous! It is served on a 3 tier stand ..... the presentation is  really amazing : )   We were lucky to get a seat as there were only about 2 tables left on the front patio. It was great to see it so busy as well as to see everyone enjoying their tea and sandwiches!  We had to order the Paris Tea once again as we had been craving it since our last visit. The staff as last time were wonderful and we picked up yet another little item at the gift store."}
{"text":"Great place for afternoon tea if you're up to making the drive. I was here for a bridal shower and I'll have to say this was probably the best place for the occasion.   The service was great. The servers came around and recommended a tea based on what we like. Overall they were incredibly friendly and really felt like royalty here.   I recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice lunch but don't expect to be in and out. You must savor the tea and enjoy the moment. So many things to look at here at the English Rose Tea Room."}
{"text":"Went there right when it opened this morning at 11. I walked in and there was absolutely no one in the place. We told the hostess that we didn't have reservations but she sat us anyway. We were stuck right in the corner by the entrance though. The decor was super cute and the place looked very clean. The service was quite slow though. We ordered the cream tea platter. Which came with two scones, jam, cream cheese and a small pot of tea. You could upgrade the small tea pot to a large one for only $2 extra. I must say that the tea was excellent (we got the fruit and honey tea) and the scones were yummy, and the jam was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be returning in the near future (with reservations though!). I loved this place and was satisfied with the establishment!"}
{"text":"Fantastic all the time!  Have been many times and now it is so popular...with Downton Abbey advertisement, that a reservation much be made in advance.  Jo is lovely as are the servers.  Nice selection of teas and sandwiches.  Great place for a girl birthday or an afternoon with friends...and visitors, who love it!  My granddaughter was in heaven!"}
{"text":"Quaint place with good tea and food! It is quite unique and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"When I lived in California my sister and I used to go to this darling tea room. It closed and I have been searching for a replacement ever since. Flash forward 7 plus years and a move to Arizona, I finally found it here. This place is just wonderful. It is a bit of a drive to get to from the valley but it is totally worth it. The prices are the most reasonable I have ever seen. Their Duchess of Bedford Afternoon Tea is $28 and can easily be split between two people. I think there is a minimal split charge of $2.50 but most tea places charge $28 per person regardless of how many people are eating. So their prices are much better. I would recommend upgrading to the large pot of tea if you are planning on a leisurly meal and want to sip and chat for a while. The small pot that comes with it won't get you that far. They also have many other things on the menu, that I have never tried, if you are looking for something simpler or outside of the \"traditional\" high tea. My most recent visit was with my 3 year old daughter and my cousin. They are super accomedating for young children, in fact they love them, and have a tea just for them. It's only $12 and could easily be split between two kids. That is not to say that this is what you would consider a \"family restaurant\". I certainly wouldn't bring my kid if she couldn't sit still and wanted to run around. There just isn't room to run around for a kid. In any event the food is delightful, yummy and so very British. Three teirs packed with tea sandwiches, scones, clotted cream, jam, desserts ... my mouth is watering just writing this. The genuine British woman who owns it is always at the front desk checking people in (Unless she is on a trip to England. Which she will tell you all about via email if you sign up for the mailing list. It's adorable). She is typically wearing a giant hat that I totally wish I could pull off. She is just so charming. You certainly want to call ahead and make reservations. This place is always packed. However, don't hesitate to cal,l day of, and see if they have something open. I know that many tea houses in the valley require a 24 hour notice, but here they have been able to squeeze me in same day on many occasions. Don't be afraid to dress up either. On their website they explain proper tea attire if you want to go all out. They have tons of hats there too that you can borrow while you dine. I really can not say enough about how much I love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their quiche is to die for...seriously, if you're a foodie, you will have dreams about this stuff. (I do!) Ok, so this is my second review for ERTR. But I had to write this one because I discovered a little surprise when I finished my lunch yesterday!  I had my tea leaves read by intuitive consultant Janice Roper, who has a cozy alcove in the adjacent ERTR gift shop.   Great lunch, fascinating experience with Janice Roper. (I was able to get a walk-in appointment with Janice---I hear it's a good idea to call for an appointment.) Where else can you have  a fabulous lunch, experience tea-time ambiance, shop and get your tea leaves read? No where but here. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. Beautiful location, lovely staff and some of the tastiest tea and scones I have ever had. I will be returning with all the ladies in my life!!"}
{"text":"So elegant and beautiful. It felt like just like a little teahouse in Europe. The food was great and the service was wonderful. It was nice to play dress up in the many hats that they have available for use."}
{"text":"It is said that you eat with your eyes first before you eat with your mouth. This is so true when we entered the English Rose Tea Room. You enter a small lobby where all of your senses are tickled.  I felt as though I had stepped in to an English tea museum where it was okay to touch the art  and I had the chance to bring the treasures home. That's even before I got to the good stuff. Although a small place, they have not missed an opportunity to display everything that you want in a true English Tea House. You are welcomed by a very personalized, dedicated staff and by the owner Jo. They've even gone so far as to provide hats for those of us that want the full experience. When we were sat at our table we were provided quite an extensive menu, although it was respectful to the English tea delicacies. I was provided a delightful waitress with burgundy hair named Paige. She covered the specials of the day and when I wasn't sure what type of tea I should have there was an expansive description next to each name in the menu. Paige took a moment to point out some of her favorites and why she enjoyed them. Both I and my lunch guest went with her recommendations and were more than pleased with the recomms. Plentiful were the options for dressing up our tea from white sugar cubes to brown sugar cubes, to milk to lemons. Our pots were refilled anytime they were low.  Both I and my lunch guest went with the quiche special and were amazed at what a delicious combination it was. It had saut√©ed plump mushrooms, golden soft onions, vibrant green, fresh spinach and a bubbling layer of cheddar cheese. All this deliciousness was nestled in one of the flakiest, tender quiche crusts. The serving size was plentiful. This came with a spring green salad with in-house made blue cheese dressing. We couldn't leave without a dessert so we each chose a scone with Devon cream and strawberry preserves. This place makes scones the right way, firm with a near crispy outside and soft on the inside. The Devon cream is not a simple whip cream but instead is a marriage between butter and whip cream so rich and delicious it offsets the shell of the scone, a perfect marriage.  We finished lunch will full bellies, lips warm and smiling from the cascades of sweet and floral fresh teas.  We were treated as the most important guests, with the same respect to the other patrons.  Our lunch turned out to be a lovely experience that created great memories, one that I look forward to to repeating very soon!"}
{"text":"It was better than the High Tea at the Brown Hotel in London or the Phoenician in Phoenix and on par with the Empress in Victoria, British Columbia.  It's always hard to find special activities for out of town visitors during the hot Phoenix summer.  I took my cousin from Dallas as a surprise and she loved it.  The treats, choices of tea, china settings, atmosphere and service couldn't have been better.  My cousin was amused that we were going to Carefree and we turned on Easy Street.  Check it out."}
{"text":"We went to this tea room for a 10 am afternoon tea (kinda sorta high tea).  The hostess was very welcoming and directed us to the box of hats (we were all too eager to try them on).  Fun, feminine decor. Your typical tea room experience. A nice selection of teas, pastries and sandwiches.  We've already booked our next tea!"}
{"text":"I surprised my sister here for here B-Day. It was so delightful! There Blood Orange Cranberry TEA was AMAZING!!! And we got the assorment of yummy treats with Veggie and Salmon Quiche. It was very filling. I'm definitely going again. Enjoy you wont be disappointed. Take a couple of girlfriends and have a Spot of Tea!!!"}
{"text":"The English Rose Tea Room is a sweet, charming tea room with good service, good tea, and fairly good food. I love to take my daughter for afternoon tea or for lunch with friends. The last time we went, my ten-year-old daughter and I ordered the cream tea (I think it was called). It was two scones with cream and jelly and a pot of tea for like $9.95 or something like that. Well worth it for a special afternoon with my special girl. The tea was very good and the scones were HUGE. We were stuffed. I would have liked a little more cream because they were a little dry, but still pretty good. Anyhow, it's a fun experience and I love that I live just a few miles away so we can go whenever we want."}
{"text":"Loved this tea room. My only complaint is the service was lacking. Was hard to get my servers attention. Beautiful place to go."}
{"text":"first visit, will be back.absolutely lovely for women of all ages. the indoor space is delightfully decorated like a victorian tea parlour. they have hats to borrow, should you like to indulge and not have your own. the servings are quite generous for the price. the interior is a tad tight but tgat adds to its charm somehow if you have a guest with a walker or wheel chair i woukd let then know in advance. the outdoor patio looked a bit roomier but wasnt in use on tge very hot day that we were there. there were large groups of 7 or 8 and small grouos of 2, plus a few tables of very well behaved children. the center it is in has lots for kids. a water park, slides, artwork and more. i really enjoyed the tearoom, the plaza and the other shops. worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with the girls. Especially nice for a real tea party with the younger ones"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Right in the heart of Carefree so lots to do before/ after tea. Treats are above and beyond the Phoenician Resort where I have taken my daughter to tea before and a fraction of the price. Order a quiche!!! Had the salmon and it was the best quiche I have ever eaten. We will come back time and time again."}
{"text":"Loved this tea room! It was quite the drive for my friends and I but well worth the trip. We made reservations before hand ( good idea to do this since it's pretty cramped) for our friends 28th birthday. The decor was exquisite and the overall environment was extremely fitting for a tea room. The servers were really sweet as well. As for the teas, all were delicious! We ended getting a few snack tiers including small finger sandwiches and scones, which were all very enjoyable. The location is great since there's a little bridge and lake across the tea room--we ended up being able to take some lovely photos for the birthday girl. Took off a star because it's on the pricey side--worth it for an occasion but probably wouldn't drop into this place for my daily tea and scone fix."}
{"text":"This is your full blown charming British style tea where the patrons often dress up in hats and dresses. You must make a reservation because they will be booked. If you are feeling nostalgic for a taste of Great Britain, visit this tea room and you won't be disappointed.  The sandwiches, tea, pastries and scones are all good but not spectacular on their own. This is more of an experience with many tea pots and accessories for sale. Great place to bring your daughters and have an afternoon lunch with girlfriends."}
{"text":"My mother takes everyone to this place; she's a big fan of tea. I drink tea but am certainly no connoisseur. Their food was pretty good, and the place is very girly and cutesy. Great place to take grandma or mom. Things were reasonable priced; my only complaint was that it was kind of close quarters. I felt like I was dining in a closet. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Unique experience."}
{"text":"One of the first things I wanted to do after I moved from California to Arizona was to go to the English Rose Tea Room.  Arrived in Arizona Tuesday evening and went to the English Rose Tea Room for lunch today (Friday).  Had studied their menu online and saw they had a salad that included some of my favorite things, cranberries, Stilton cheese, chicken, candied walnuts, apples, and raspberry vinaigrette, so I ordered that.  It was really good and enough for three people (although I managed to eat the whole thing and then skipped dinner tonight).  Planning on going back again soon with my friend, who was at work today.  Also got three blueberry scones to go for her son to have when he came home from school.  He came home from school and ate them all and looked at me like he wished I had ordered half a dozen, rather than three, blueberry scones to go."}
{"text":"Great tea room So English and authentic  There for a 25 th birthday celebration  She loved it  Loved the tea And scones and tea sandwiches   Great time For all And our guys went as well Must go"}
{"text":"I'm originally from England and all I can say is Thank you for bringing a little bit of home to me.  Authentic British goodies and staff!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have experienced a lot better!! They really oversell in their ad. If you have experienced another Tea that is truly awesome you won't enjoy this one. The place is VERY crowded, VERY noisy to the point you have to yell for your friends to hear you, the food was so dry and the tea had absolutely no flavor. By the way for 2 people you can only choose one tea. It was not enjoyable. Sure the price is enticing, but it is worth paying more for a much better experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a fun way to experience an English tea. We were seated outside which was really pleasant. The inside seemed crowded, tight and busy. The food was excellent and we all enjoyed our choices of teas. The staff was very friendly. Good for all ages. Quite lovely."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for those who love tea or British culture. The decorations inside are absolutely lovely and the atmosphere is what made me come back each time. Just take a look at the photos! Their Paris tea is a customer favorite. It was so good, that I had bought tea leaves for home! Unfortunately, the downfall to this place is the food/desserts; it is not filling nor memorably delicious. I suppose you don't really go to tea rooms for food, but still. However, the biggest offense is the weekend staff. When I came here during the week, I experienced great service and I even met the owner. The times I came during the weekend, the service was just decent at best and rude at worst. Sadly, my last visit the lady \"helping\" us just made me want to leave ASAP and never return (and I have not come back).  In summary, the tea and atmosphere are the highlights. I would recommend coming during the week and definitely making a reservation. This might not be somewhere you will or want to frequently visit, but anyone interested should come here once."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!  Service and food are great and the atmosphere is so cute!  Completely girly, over-top-victorian and makes for a fun girls brunch.  I would def recommend it!"}
{"text":"This review is long due.   I adore this place. The antique tea cups, hats, shabby chic decor and bone china squeezed into every nook and corner make this tiny tea room a charming spot for a traditional afternoon tea. What better? The teas are delicious and the food delivers on quality and taste. Seriously, in that setting it's hard to complain. So, don't get hung up on the nitty gritties and just enjoy the royal treatment.   Go with your gang of girls or even better your mom, grandma or your little daughter. It will make any girl smile. Oh! The owner is a Brit who is a pleasure to talk to as well. I cannot get enough of the accent!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  From the moment we arrived, we received great service from all of the staff (served by Shane, greeted by Hillary and checked in by another waitress and owner) and felt very welcomed.  There is a great selection of teas and treats, and all are extremely delicious.  The shop is decorated beautifully with a cute shop.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A few of my friends & our daughters came here for tea /lunch one afternoon. I'll start off with what I liked about this place. Very charming, fun , beautiful decor and nice selection of gifts in the shop . I also like that you can have fun and try on different hats our girls loved that part the most. As for the negatives the help was not welcoming or very friendly & felt service was not good. The tables are too close together I was constantly being bumped into by the staff and other guests. The prices seem high for what you get although the food was good the portions are really tiny for the price & left hungry. I didn't like that we didn't hardly have any service. We had to ask for plates and napkins / glasses why wasn't this set up properly since we made reservations ? The girl brought our bill out and tried clearing out girls plates and they were not even finished eating. I felt very rushed and didn't appreciate that especially since we had just paid $100+ for lunch also they automatically add a 20% gratuity on there and don't split checks ? Were in 2018 how do you not split checks ? Luckily we all had cash so not the end of the world. But didn't feel 20% was appropriate for the level of service we received. I will give this place another try could have just been an off day but my girls enjoyed it and makes for a change of atmosphere :) I did see a tier for 3 come out in the way out that looked amazing !!!! I will be getting that next time and the veggie quiche was very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a magical place. When you walk through the door you feel like you are Alice in Wonderland attending a tea party. The rooms are ornately decorated with plates and tea cups. The service is fast and professional. The food is expertly prepared. I loved the chicken salad, desserts and tea. I recommend a visit as a change of pace."}
{"text":"I love this place!the service is outstanding, big varieties of teas and the pastries are delicious!it feels like being in England without leave Arizona!I hardly recommend!"}
{"text":"I took my niece to her first tea experience and we had a lovely time. The place is quaint and decorated exquisitely. The food was amazing, service was wonderful and the ambience was perfection. We loved it."}
{"text":"Great place to take my granddaughters. Although we had my Daughters bridal shower there the on the terrace the staff was very friendly always around to assist and make our visit a great visit. Food was good I really liked the Salmon sandwiches and the Carmel tea."}
{"text":"Awesome place for girlfriends to hang out. They have extensive list of teas for tea lovers like me. Had their afternoon tea special. Came with assorted sandwiches and pastries. Enough for 2 people. I'd love to try their other lunch entrees next time. Although it felt bit claustrophobic at times especially when people started filling in, the lovely decorations on the walls were nice distractions. At least worth one visit to check it out for yourself. Love the hats for you to use while you're there."}
{"text":"Can't beat the ambiance! This is a quaint, adorable shop/restaurant, so very British. A wonderful place for ladies to enjoy time together. Many women wear hats. There are so many pretty knick-knacks to look at, from china tea services to jewelry and stationary. It is definitely a very feminine place. The teas that they serve are absolutely amazing, you don't need sugar or cr√®me they are so good. My favorite tea is the chocolate cherry tea. When we go we normally split a tower which is more than enough and priced well at $14.00 each. The scones are delicious served with Devonshire cr√®me and imported jam. The finger sandwiches are good a variety of salmon, chicken and cucumber salad. The top tier is tiny desserts all are very interesting and different. It does make for a lovely afternoon!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  I have been lucky enough to go a few times.  I even got my husband there, and that is saying a lot.  Just wish it was closer  we live 100 miles away, but still worth it for a special occasion. Never been to England but this place makes me feel like I am.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It's quite a challenge to find an authentic English tea room in the states, as most tend to be catered to an American audience. (understandably so, but still not what us Brits are looking for, lol) BUT the English Rose Tea Room is by far the best I've ever been to, and it even tops a few back home!  The cost is reasonable, the staff is absolutely charming and the decor is beyond impressive. And the cuisine....let's just say I left barely able to stand from stuffing my face more than I should have.  If you are looking for something authentic, delicious and well-presented, in a welcoming atmosphere, this is the place. If you assume every cottage pie should taste like \"your mum's\", and nothing quite hits home, then you might want to learn your family's recipe. ;)"}
{"text":"Such a cute girly date to go to with friends and family. The food was great and the tea was amazing! I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to have a fun girls day"}
{"text":"It was nice..to do once.  In my opinion it was kinda  overpriced and those tea sandwiches are just a bit too small for me.  My friend and I had the cottage pie but we were neither one impressed, I believe they must've overdid it on the oregano.  Overall nice experience especially with my Mom being there with me.  She enjoyed it so that's what the stars are for."}
{"text":"Tea for two on a Friday afternoon was delicious...once we finally were seated and served.  This is a lovely, if a bit overdone, tea room.  The problem was really disjointed and slow service.  Just getting close to the front desk for our reservation took 10 minutes because no one was there to take payment from guests who were trying to leave.  There were  a dozen people squeezed into a tiny area.  This was especially uncomfortable for a table for two guests who were trying to enjoy a relaxing tea right next to the front desk....while people hovered over them.    Once we were seated, it took another 10 minutes for the waitress to acknowledge us.  Afternoon tea should be a calm and rejuvenating experience. With tables very close together and staff few and far between, that was hard to achieve. Having\"done\" tea around the US and world, this was a disappointment.  I did enjoy the food, but the experience fell far short my expectations."}
