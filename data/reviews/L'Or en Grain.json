{"text":"Excellent café \"Pour-over\" et espresso. Dégustation gratuite et service très sympathique."}
{"text":"This place is a really nice coffee shop! When I went there, the staff was very kind, explained their product in detail, and gave me a sample coffee for free!! They have a variety of coffee beans from all over Canada. If you make a coffee by yourself, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Really amazing coffee and the coffee person was so knowledgeable! He was very helpful and recommended some nearby cafes to grab a bite . This was one of the best coffee I have ever had and I wish I had gone there more during my stay ."}
{"text":"It's a very unique coffeeshop. True coffee lovers with good knowledge of coffee beans would love this place. I might not be the best to review this beautiful coffeeshop. It's super spacious but sadly two table set ups were there. My favorite part this shop were all the pictures that were hanging on the walls. It is about coffee and its interesting quotes. There are lots of shelves; with coffee beans and all kinds of coffeemakers, such as pour over or areo presser. Our barista is so knowledgeable and enthusiastic to explain all about the coffee and how it is made. I was really impressed how passionate he was. So my friends and I took pour over coffee with fruit flavor and my other friend took the same coffee with chocolate flavor. Omg... so strong! Too much for my stomach to handle. I had put 4 sugars and milk, and I wasn't able to finish it. Honestly, I am not a coffee lover so I am not made for this place."}
{"text":"Hands down probably the best coffee I've ever heard. A very cute independent coffee shop that has the best beans from South America and Canada and other places. They have a dedicated area for Canadian coffee and it's labelled from which city it's from. 

They have all kinds of tools, machines and coffee makers available at your disposal. I walked around to see what they were specific to. There's beautiful posters and paintings decorated. 

Unfortunately they have 2 very very small tables in such a spacious cafe. You can sit on the high chairs at the register. However, it would be nice if they incorporated more sitting space available. 

The barista explained the different coffees available and why they are different. Upon his recommendation I ordered the chocolate pour-over. It was excellent! Very strong coffee, to the point I was up way past midnight! I added milk, no sugar and it was perfect. I tried my friends fruit coffee pour over and I didn't like it, nor did they. I finished my fairly large mug, whereas they couldn't. It was nice to watch the process of the coffee being made. Really enjoyed it. 

Again, not enough chairs to sit and enjoy the coffee which is primarily why it loses a star."}
{"text":"Ouverte depuis peu dans le Plateau, cette boutique de café a tout pour plaire aux amateurs de café 3e vague. On y retrouve une grande variété de cafés provenant exclusivement de torréfacteurs canadiens. C'est donc l'endroit idéal pour s'approvisionner en café provenant d'une douzaine de brûleries telles Detour et Phil & Sebastian, pour ne nommer que celles-là. On y retrouve aussi plusieurs accessoires allant du Chemex à l'Aéropress. 

Profitez d'une visite à la boutique pour goûter un de leurs cafés en dégustation. On y retrouve aussi 2 petites tables où l'on peut s'asseoir pour siroter tranquillement un café (2$ à 2,50$ pour un 8 oz). Les prix sont décents, le service est courtois, attentionné et surtout hyper sympathique. Bref, un bien bel endroit à découvrir !"}
