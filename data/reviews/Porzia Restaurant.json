{"text":"Decor and ambience was great for a date night but the restaurant was a bit louder in volume than expected. However, this was a Saturday night and there were a few larger parties seated.   We started with the polenta tots, an appetizer made with cornmeal and an accompanying sauce (I couldn't quite place the flavours, but it had a nice texture to it). There was nothing particularly striking about this dish, but it was a light way to start off the meal.  The chicken liver agnolotti was paired with honey mushrooms and a balsamic sauce. It was smaller in portion but the agnolotti tasted fresh and delicious. Chicken liver is not usually in my daily diet, but it was definitely tasty.  The best dish of the night was the spaghetti with duck ragu, ricotta, and rosemary. The dish arrived hot, with the tantalizing aroma of duck. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente and the ragu suace had the perfect amount of spice, which gave the dish a nice heat.   To finish off, we indulged in the two desserts that were available: vanilla and pistachio ice cream sandwich made with in-house baked chocolate chip cookies, and a chocolate pudding, topped with salted roasted peanuts, and with what I vaguely recall as ricotta whipped cream. The desserts were good but not remarkable, and I have eaten better chocolate chip cookies.  Lastly, the servers were very attentive and my water glass was never empty. Overall, it was a very nice dining experience and I would recommend it if you're looking for tasty and fresh pasta."}
{"text":"Great Sunday night dinner, the buffalo mozzarella lasagne along with your choice of salad and a glass of wine for $30 was good value. Service was good as expected for a modern Italian restaurant.  The kale salad was a highlight as was the nice relaxing ambience on a Sunday with no reservation necessary."}
{"text":"Went here with my boo a little while ago.   It's a cute little resto in Parkdale with warm lighting, a good soundtrack, and a welcoming, unpretentious, natural  vibe.  Italian-influenced menu and a killer bartender who made me the best virgin cocktail I've ever had.  Better than what I got at Alinea, and that's saying something.  It was like pear and rosemary and citrus.  Delicious.   We ate:  A special that day - warm, potato-dough stuffed pizza thing with proscuitto and mortadella served with a fennel & kohlrabi slaw.  Hamachi crudo.  Ye gods, I love me some crudo, so hard.  I wish we had an all-crudo restaurant in Toronto.  This was served with beets and radishes and lightly dressed, but nothing competed with the flavour of the rich yellowtail.  I literally took a bite and got goosebumps.  Everything was perfect about this dish, temperature of ingredients, degree of doneness for the vegetables.  I could eat this all day.  Cotechino crostini with warm rapini.  I LOVE COTECHINO.  It's a small thing, but the restaurant gets the crostinis PERFECT and that's a good foundation.  The bread is charred but not overly crisped, with a giving chew.  This was warm, rich, and salty with just the right amount of bite from the rapini.  Chicken liver agnolotti with honey mushrooms.  You know who loves chicken livers?  US.  What's not to love about a delicate, punched up chicken liver filling encased in perfectly cooked fresh pasta tossed up with a tangle of woodsy honey mushrooms in a light brown butter sauce?  NOTHING, THAT'S WHAT.   Grilled octopus served over semolina with peanuts and apples.  The octopus was perfectly cooked and the flavour combination of the semolina, apples, and peanuts was a revelation.  I'm not sure that the dish was harmonious, in that it seemed to comprise two distinct components (the octopus on the one hand and the semolina on the other), but both those components were individually executed perfectly, and it was an interesting, challenging dish.  Sweetbreads.  You know who likes sweetbreads?  Me!  With bacon and romesco and sunchokes.  UGH.  I LOVE SWEETBREADS SO DAMNED MUCH.  I would say that the sunchokes were a little under and disrupted the overall texture of the dish, but the sunchokes themselves were delicious - they were raw so they had a nice, woody, earthy taste that you usually lose when you cook them.  Bone marrow and snails.  You know who loves bone marrow?  THIS GUY.  This was sauced with a delicate brown demi-type sauce and the snails were garlicky and the bone marrow was bone-marrow-y and everything was deliciously sopped up with more of those perfect crostinis.  I literally punched the air a million times when this dish came out to the table.  I could make a meal of this dish and this dish alone.  For dessert we had the chocolate hazelnut mousse.  This dish was fine, the plating could use a bit of work, but compared to the heights of the previous dishes, next time I might skip dessert and just double-down on the marrow.  The pricing was fair, the atmosphere grown-up, the service was perfectly professional but laid back.  Would definitely go back and recommend this heartily."}
{"text":"We went to Chantecler but they were booked, so we decided to go next door and try out Porzia last week. For the price, the service was mediocre, food was ok, a bit over priced, and the drinks, not worth the money. We came here by default with two friends and we left wishing we had saved our money and ate at home instead.   Also, we do not appreciate restaurants automatically setting the tipping percentage to 18% when paying on Credit Card or on debit: 1. Why are you asking me to tip on tax? Did the tax bring me my drink, make my meal?  2. Was the service exceptionally great that I would want to tip 18% on top of the tax?  Assuming that you will receive 18% automatically is audacious when the service has not meet the customers expectations.  15% on before tax, and that's being generous. You want better tips, earn it!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with fantastic service in a tastefully decorated restaurant. Would recommend it again. It was perfect for dinner with the in laws and would be great for a date. Everyone ate very well."}
{"text":"The food was incredible, except very small portions.  The service was incredibly dissapointing. Had a birthday there, took a very long time for people to attend  to us for drinks. I requested extra water for the table and server proceeded to assign glasses and questioned need for more water. A friend brought cupcakes to celebrate and brought her own candles, they charged $30 to \"plate it\"- put them on a plate.  The service was not adaptable or attentive. We were very dissapointed. The drinks and food were great, once we finally got service to request these items."}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday dinner, and it was a mediocre experience:  not terrible, but not what we were expecting from some of the positive reviews we read.  I had the burrata appetizer, which was very good.  For my main I had the duck ragu spaghetti, which was extremely salty:  I like salty foods, so it's rare for me to ever think something is too salty.  One of my friends had a dish with lamb sausage that I sampled, and again the saltiness overpowered and destroyed all the other flavours.  It was to such an extreme that I have to think there was some kind of mistake, and it wasn't the actual recipe.  Or perhaps Lot's wife works in the kitchen.  Service was so-so.  Not horrible, but not overly interested.  Server didn't check to see how our meals were, so I ate half of mine, and then we just settled the bill and left.    Considering how positive some of the reviews on here are, maybe we just suffered through a kitchen catastrophe?   There are so many good restaurants near here that I probably won't bother coming back to find out."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 2 for a Saturday night with no problems, which I was glad, as I highly prefer reservations. The atmosphere was warm, with a small candle for every  table, and romantic lighting. The service was fast, and friendly. The open kitchen in the back allowed aromas to seep into the dining area, making us salivate and crave the food we ordered even more. We ordered the 100mg greens to start, which was fresh and crisp. For mains, we ordered hamachi crudo, which, although delicious, it took us a couple bites to figure out where the hamachi was. We also ordered the octopus that everyone has been talking about, and it definitely did not disappoint. My friend actually said \"I didn't think that octopus could taste like this, it's so tender!\". We might have ordered inappropriately as every dish we had had nuts garnished on top, which made everything a bit less interesting and exciting. If I ever need a good Italian meal, and is in the area, I would go back to Porzia."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dinners I've had in a long time. We were set to have dinner at grand electric however the line up was 2.5 hrs (like really are you kidding me! For tacos!) so we ended up at Porzia which I'm really glad we did. There was 4 of us for dinner so we ordered a wife variety of apps, pastas and mains which allowed me to try a lot more. We started with the Brussel sprout salad which was delicious, crunchy and tangy, the crostini with rapini and sausage which was sooooo good the sausage was the highlight I could have eaten the whole plate. We had the testa fritti which to be honest was not a hit for me, it had a weird texture I have a feeling there may have been some offal meat in it.  The highlight for the pasta course we ordered was the tagliatelle with feta, brussels and pancetta, it was light and so good - again I could have eaten the whole bowl to myself if we had not been sharing. We did order the \"best bone marrow in t.o.\" (As per blogTO), the snails on top were tasty, but the bone marrow wasn't something I was overly fond of. I have this aversion to fat so don't skip ordering it over my review. The best main in my opinion was the halibut with olive tapenade, pickled fiddle heads and I believe oyster mushrooms. I wanted to lick the plate clean. The contrast of the light fish with the tangy veggies, so yummy!  Overall the night was great, the service was fantastic, and the food came quickly. I definitely recommend a trip to Porzia."}
{"text":"This place was great! I would really recommend going here. It's the type of restaurant you can share plates or have your own. You definitely want to keep coming back to try the whole menu. It was so delicious!! We got the crostini and the artichoke fritti to start. The artichoke was better but nothing mouth watering. Then got the kale salad. It's a must!! So well done with the ricotta. Super fresh and healthy. Along with the Brussel sprouts and pancetta. Really good. And our moans were the baklava ravioli, beyond tasty. And you must get he bone marrow with the escargot on top. Super good as well. We also got desert. It was my birthday. I like to try different restaurants and I usually don't go back but I would defibrillator go back to Poroza on a date, friends or family. Tables no more than 4-6. Most parties are 2-4."}
{"text":"Great find! Feeling for some Italian, this seemed like a good choice, and it was! Service, fantastic.  I actually should've tipped a bit more, but I was distracted by good conversation and a good time.  Shame on me!  Polenta Tots - These come hot, and come delicious! Kale - It was good, not spectacular.  Chicken Liver Agnolotti - A real winner on this one.  For those that like liver. Bone Marrow - Good, but I wish there were a sid e of pasta that would have come with this.  Desserts - the chocolate donut/pudding was good.  We'd come back again."}
{"text":"This place has a great layout and great decor. The service is quite friendly and fast. The food was pretty good and they hAd a great drinks selection. It can be kind of expensive, but all in all it is worth checking out."}
{"text":"The tomato aka bruschetta appetizer was literally TDF!  Ambiance was candle lit and cozy chic. A must for fresh and intimate Italian!"}
{"text":"Just tried out this new resto a few saturdays ago. The atmosphere was cozy and bustling, but not too busy. The open kitchen was nice and the wait staff was attentive, but perhaps could have been more informative. Which didn't really matter in the end as our dishes were all amazing.    We started with the crostini which I thought was brave pairing of soul food ingredients. The grated parm really brought together the sharpness of the sauteed rapini and hearty pate. Next the Hamachi salad was tart, yet sweet and the fish was fresh and plentiful. To finish we had the octopus and chicken liver agnolotti which we shared and was also a nice combo of flavors. The octopus was grilled to perfection, pleasantly meaty but still tender with bright summery flavorings, the agnolotti was a treat for me and my girlfriend who doesn't normally eat liver at all, really liked the dish and ate a bunch of it. The flavor was surpisingly light.   What stuck out for me was the  flavor combos, pleasing proportions and thoughtful ambience. bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Wednesday $10 plates  Didn't choose the restaurant because of its Wednesday special-had intended to go there based on Globe and Mail review.  Having said that, the two of us ordered 3 plates to share. The portions were so tiny that managing the food cost was clearly the chef's focus rather than offering value on a slow night.  We had:  Kale salad - very nice dressing - ying and yang of raisins and cheese.  Chicken Liver Agnolotti - each of us got 3 mushrooms-very good and 2 humdrum raviolis each stuffed with 1 1/2 teaspoons of chicken liver.  Spaghetti Carbonara - very salty - almost like it was cooked and then drenched in salted butter .   Not an experience worth repeating."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and every single time I go, its been amazing. I can't remember all the things I or my friends ordered, but some of them were the kale salad, the tuna carpaccio, the chicken liver agnolotti, and the cavatelli. I'm not going to go into huge detail over the perfectly cooked pasta or whatever, but Im just going to say that every dish has interesting and comforting flavours at the same time. Im Italian, and I can say that this is not your nonna's cooking, but something about it is still comforting and familiar. This is more modern Italian I suppose,maybe its more Northern Italian? Either way who cares every single dish I tasted was like a mix of something familiar but done really differently with new and complex flavours. I actually get excited to taste all the tastes when I go there, and Im not even that kind of person.There are so many Italian restaurants, but this one is actually good, unique, and worth going to.  The service is perfect. Everyone is so friendly and nice, every time I have gone the waitresses have been perfectly attentive, nice, made good recommendations and were just overall on point. The restaurant has a bit of an industrial feel to it with the exposed pipes and bricks. They took that however and still used lighting and seating etc to make it really really cozy.   The wine selection is amazing, and I'm not always the best at choosing wines I like, but every time i go there I get a great glass of wine.  Finally, overall the price is always really good. Like two people can go there get antipasti, main, dessert and a each a glass of wine and its around 100 bucks. Thats pretty good for an actual good restaurant on Queen west if you ask me. My only one complaint would be the budino they have for dessert. They are really good, like who doesn't like fried dough, but honestly, they taste EXACTLY EXACTLY like churros. The only thing different is the shape (its a ball, not a cylinder). At the end of an Italian meal I wanna taste an Italian flavour, not one that I typically associate with Latin American food. Thats it."}
{"text":"***-1/2 stars  Porzia, an Italian restaurant in the hipster neighborhood of Parkdale has received lots of lip service since its opening and has made the short-list of nominees for Air Canada's enRoute Magazine's list of best new restaurants; voting has now closed and the winners will be announced on October 24.  I stopped by on Monday, where Porzia features 3 for $33 + 1/2 price bottles of wine.  It wasn't a true full three courses, as the four of us shared 2 pasta dishes, but I appreciated that the meal was properly portioned to allow room for dessert. When the food is flavorful, you seldom need more than a few bites anyways.  The noise level is the kind you would expect at a frat house party -  it's loud, it's lively and next time you might want to bring a megaphone, dine alone or with a mime.  Our server is mal à l'aise and isn't very knowledgeable about the menu save for hearsay recommendations on what we should order. As the place fills up, the waiting in between courses become longer and our server was definitely not hustling to keep things moving. Luckily, the food makes up for the unenthusiastic service.  The wine list is predominantly Italian (and relatively foreign to me as I haven't really sipped enough of Italy); but we decide based on the food that we'd opt for a red and the server made some recommendations and let us taste the wine before we selected one that we liked.    Our bottle of red is left un-decanted and our server can't be bothered with a wine bucket and we decide to pay ourself any tips in excess of 15% since we topped up our own glasses the entire night; perhaps another nuance of dining in the hipster-ish locale of Parkdale where all formalities go to hell.  Here's what we ate:  Beet Salad, bleu d'Elizabeth, sunflower, flax - It's a great balance of sweet and salty and also makes use of one of my favorite fall root vegetables.  The sunflower-flax brittle works really well  Trippa Fritta, cabbage, chili conserva - The trippa fritta with cabbage \"slaw\" and chili conserva is tender yet crispy with a Sriracha-like dipping sauce.  The flavors were simple but I enjoyed every bite.  Blood Pudding, King Oyster mushroom, cauliflower + rye - I loved the texture of the blood pudding; somewhere between a terrine and pâté.    Cavallo Tonnato - A dish traditionally made with veal (Vitello Tonnato) but is replaced here with a more adventurous protein of horse.  The tuna is actually what catches my attention in this dish.  Chicken Liver Agnolotti, Chanterelle, Honey Mushroom - While the chicken liver was very smooth; the duo of mushrooms really stole the show.  Nothing more simple and divine than mushrooms sautéed in butter!  Gnocchi, broccoli + Pecorino - If broccoli always tasted this good, I don't think any parents would have to put on a variety show to convince their kids to eat their greens.   Beef Short Rib, broccoli, Romesco & onion mostardo - Meaty, fall-off-the-bone pieces of meat that would make any caveman a happy one.  Octopus, semolina, apple + peanut - Great char and I loved the crisp of the pickled cucumber and crunch of the peanuts.  Duck, Yukon Gold, bitter peach mostardo - You can never go wrong with duck!  The fingerling potatoes were done like a potato salad and I liked the zing of the grainy mustard.  The duck was juicy and full-flavored!  Pork Shoulder, whey-cooked beans + Swiss chard - Compared to the other dishes we ate this was our least favorite;  leaner and tougher in comparison - definitely missing a little pizzazz.  Cannoli, apple, cinnamon - These Ricotta-filled horns were nice and crisp though I wasn't a fan of the \"apple sauce\" that came with.  The apple slices however, I could've eaten bowlfuls of with a bit of licorice flavor (something I don't normally like).  Caffe e Zeppole, chocolate budino, caramelized eggplant & white chocolate. Eggplant in dessert?!  Sounds weird but exceeded all our expectations as the purée blended really well with the chocolate mousse.  The earthiness of the eggplant worked really well against the strong chocolate flavor and silky budino.  Overall, the dominating flavor was chocolate.  All in all a great meal at Porzia and a plus that they take reservations. While the kitchen runs like a well-oiled machine, the front-of-house could use a little sprucing up."}
{"text":"what attracted me to this lovely resto?   wednesday: $10 plates  oh, also cuz of the line up at grand electric.   But i was glad to stumble upon this cute establishment. The crowd was more young-mid working professionals. music wasn't blasting like grand electric but the atmosphere was just as warm and cozy.   we were seated close to the kitchen and couldn't help but watch the chef focus on their works of art. Captivating. The chef was charming with his passion for culinary but man was he handsome. wouldn't mind watching him cook all night LOL :)  FOOD: menu has a lot of italian terminology. My fellow asians and I had to google the words we couldn't pronounce. Their menu items were unique, not your ordinary resto. In plain english, we ordered chicken liver ravioli and lamb sausage to share. Ofc they came paired with sides and sauces although portion was a bit small. However, most restaurants on Queen St have smaller servings so it's already expected.   Will come again to try other menu items"}
{"text":"Delicious meal and attentive yet warm service. An excellent negroni to start followed by 3 courses of delicious, fresh Italian cooking. Started with lamb pasta to share (the pasta was cooked to al dente perfection) followed by turbot (fish) and finally a chocolate-eggplant-fried-goodness for dessert (can't remember the name for the life of me). Nothing priced over $24 which is great value for the calibre of food and refreshing compared to so many overpriced places in this city!"}
{"text":"I am not at all embarrassed to admit that I love to eat, and I ate very well at Porzia - a total of ten courses!!! TEN!!! And each one was more delectable than the last. Cotechino Crostini, Asparagus salad, Hamachi Crudo, Cavallo Tonnato, Chicken Liver Agnolotti, Bone Marrow, Octopus, Bay Leaf Gelato, the list goes on... Every dish was our favorite dish. Every plate was perfectly prepared, with unique and unexpected flavour profiles. This is one of those places where the menu is nearly irrelevant, there is no way from looking at the menu that you could even begin to anticipate the range of tastes, textures, and incredible creativity that goes into this food. Don't worry about the menu, just go and EAT. It's incredible."}
{"text":"Just like the some of you, I'm happy this place takes reservations.   The place was busy with a short line up by 830 on Saturday night. The atmosphere holds its own just ever so slightly compared to the rest of the places in Parkdale, Dundas, and Ossington.  Had an old fashioned. Could be smoother, could have been stronger, just mediocre to be honest.  I can't remember the proper name to my appetizer. Horse and Tuna would be the translation. I enjoyed it! Cooked on the rare side, the texture is similar to rare roast beef slices. It was a good meaty dish that I needed that night.   Chicken liver agnolotti - maybe I expected a bit more after I read the past reviews. Sorry, I've had a better chicken liver pasta at Enoteca Sociale.   Dessert was not tempting at all ... cookies of the day were biscotti and ameretti cookies. Cappuccino's foam was too stiff. Blah.   The service was fine, menu was fine, could have been executed better."}
{"text":"I've had Porzia bookmarked for a while now. Now I'm kicking myself that it took me so long to get here. It is just as good as I thought it would be.  No, better.  Every single thing we had was excellent - perfectly prepared and inventive (but in a simple  and not over-the-top way). And not a hint of kale!   I loved the beef carpaccio with the tiny quail eggs, capers and onion flowers sprinkled over the top. It was melt-in-your-mouth tender. My husband had the Gaspe prawns served with aioli. It must have been good but I couldn't tell you. We were going to share but he quietly polished it all off. ;)  I'm usually hesitant to order octopus as it's so easy to turn it into something akin to rubber bands but my bravery was repaid. It was perfect and served on buttery semolina. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the baresi sausage on rapini and white beans. YUM.  Bottom line? This unpretentious and welcoming restaurant deserves to do well. It's the right price with very friendly service and a warm atmosphere. The food is great. They know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"I had a similar experience to Chantal M. - we drove to Parkdale expecting to go to Grand Electric and got there at 6:45.  They said the wait was 1.5 hours and I was like I'm totally hungry right now!  After checking out a few online review of the restaurants on that street, we decided to go to Porzia.  Inside it had the feel of an upscale place that was both intimate and warm- not stuffy at all. We arrived and asked how long to wait for a table of two without reservations and the waitress said it would be a while, but she had seats at the bar.  We ended up not just sitting at regular bar seats, but it was right in front of the kitchen and we loved it!  We felt like we were watching a food tv cooking show seeing all the chef's cook in front of us and if they had chef's table seats, those were it!  The head chef introduced us to the other sous chefs cooking in the background and made us feel completely welcome.  We didn't know what to expect from the menu, but after a few recommendations from the waiter and the head chef we decided on:  cavallo tonnato- thinly sliced, tender and cooked rare horsemeat with tuna appetizer dressed with capers and pickled celery.  bone marrow  with snails & gremolata main, with sour dough crostini.  cavatelli with lamb meatballs main - (new to the menu)   cannoli- with rhubarb and honey and pine nuts infused with fennel  torta al cioccolato with eggplant & caramelized white chocolate  (sounds weird, but it totally worked over the warm chocolate cake!)  We had an awesome time, what a great find and I'd totally go back to this restaurant again. :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little gem in the city.  Truly such a wonderful place. It's almost like a mix of Bar Isabel, Buca, and the Black Hoof, but with much lower pricing and perhaps better service.   Why this place isn't packed - i'm not exactly sure - but it's a place that needs to be discovered.   The menu is great. Well thought out, high flavour Italian small plates - but the gem really is the marrow and snails dish. Another great thing about this place is the house made Amaro's.     As a note, they have special menu's on Monday and Wednesday, which just makes me want to go back with a large group next time."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: MONDAYS!!! ($33 prix fixe* + 1/2 price wine bottles - not glasses). WEDNESDAYS!!! (date night - $10 small plates). SUNDAYS!!! (salad + lasagna + wine for $30)  I've been here twice now and Porzia just seems on getting better. It blends modern Italian cuisine with Parkdale's ongoing love with rustic chic. The service has been good in my experience, but can be slow when it gets busy. There are a healthy selection of (Italian) wines, cocktails and craft beers on tap.  They advertise using local ingredients and making things in-house, and I think you can clearly taste the difference.  BURRATA & EGGPLANT FRITTI - served over horse bolognese and topped with anaheim and shishito peppers, this appy was one of the highlights of our meal with its different flavours and textures.  POLPETTA RAGU - freshly made meatballs that would give Hey Meatball! a run for their money.  SPAGHETTI CALABRESE - a creamy sauce served with cuts of some sort of shoulder that was a bit salty for our tastes.  BEEF SHORT RIBS - sous-vided for 48 hours and then quickly pan seared before serving, you can bet that the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  ARCTIC CHAR - they managed to make the skin light and crispy while still remaining juicy!  OCTOPUS - The serving size is relatively smaller compared to the other meat dishes but it's one tender and flavourful octopus leg.  All in all, I would definitely recommend checking out Porzia, especially their nightly specials (read: not Friday or Saturday).  *Their prix fixe could be more clearly explained. While $33 provides an appy, pasta and a meat dish, in actuality, when ordering with 2 people, you only get 5 dishes since the pasta dish is shared."}
{"text":"You know the type: Rustic Tuscan Italian with a modern twist. Porzia happens to do it very well, however, at a very reasonable price point. Service is extremely friendly and helpful. Wine list is small but well-selected."}
{"text":"Do you know how hard it is to find a delicious dinner on a Monday night in Queen W W? Thank you sincerely, Porzia, for remembering some of us don't buy groceries any night of the week.   As you can guess from my mini rant, we came in on a Monday night with some friends and enjoyed their mix-and-match, three-for-thirty prix fixe Monday menu. I had the crostini, the asparagus salad and the tortellini. In the end, the tortellini was too fishy for me, but the other two were huge culinary wins. Win win!   The atmosphere is adorable with wooden benches, lovely little touches and some of the kindest servers I've come across in Parkdale. I shall return!"}
