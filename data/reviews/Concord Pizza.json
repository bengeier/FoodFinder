{"text":"Great food and specials. Friendly staff and our favorite pizza place! Community feel and delicious!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and I like the fact that if you're not into pizza, there are many other alternatives to eat. Yum!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  The pizza is always fantastic,  and the wings.  The wings are the best I've ever eaten from a pizza joint.   As I write this there is a hot wing getting devoured.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Extensive menu. Excellent wings. Food is fast and low priced. I've been going here for many years, almost every week."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Wings....Wings are always a good size and plenty of sauce ,also  had the rib dinner which is great."}
{"text":"Great food - but - PLEASE get some competent employees beyond the H.S. kids you have working here - can't handle simple tasks such as taking a telephone order, processing a credit card, writing down address without repeating self 5X. Ordered here for years and finally gave up in frustration will not deal with this again. Hung up and called Zeppes pizza was on its way in 10 minutes no hassle. Too bad just couldn't deal with poor service anymore."}
{"text":"Super fast and love just a plain large cheese and garden salad to go . Makes a great start to the weekend. The guy behind the counter is super friendly and appeared to love his job which you don't see much any more . Try it if you haven't"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza shop! I've been eating pizza from here for years. I love the flavor of their crust and they make an excellent white sauce. The crust has a hint of sweetness to it and it's just the right density. I do not like a heavily sauced pizza. They tend to keep it light in just the right proportion to the crust and toppings. The toppings have always been quality and not overly greasy. Flavor combinations are always nicely balanced in their specialty pizzas. A couple weeks ago I had some wings that they made for a catered event. They were large and meaty with just the right amount of yummy sauce. We ordered for sheet pizzas for my son's grad party this year and they were perfect, done on time and priced right. Thanks for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"Good food and great customer service.  Great value and best local pizza joint in town."}
{"text":"thought our first time was pretty good. alot of people said it was good so we figured we'd give it a try . I can't say anything really stood out over anyone else's pizza but I liked the size , there was enough sauce and toppings seemed to be cooked long enough and I will be ordering again ."}
