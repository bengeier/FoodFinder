{"text":"I have been here 3 times and have had a great experience every time. The service is friendly, bagels are delicious, and they are dog friendly which I love. They have home made dog bagels for your pets and water bowls as well."}
{"text":"Why is it so difficult to find an egg and cheese sandwich on a hard roll in Tempe/Phoenix? Esp one that is good and under $5. Skip this one. You'd be better off going to McDonalds. 

Order: Bacon, egg and cheese w/ lettuce, tomato, mayo on a poppy seed bagel.

Pros: Name.
Cons: Microwaved eggs, microwaved bacon. They either microwaved the lettuce too, or by putting it between the cheese and the bacon, it got cooked. Yuck - hot lettuce! No mayo in the kitchen. Only packets on the counter. Oh, and the bagels.... well if you lived anywhere near NYC, these aren't good bagels."}
{"text":"Had a bacon egg and cheese on a salt bagel this morning. I was unimpressed that they microwaved the eggs and couldn't even add sliced bacon. They added pieces of bacon to the eggs and microwaved it together. It ended up being dry and flavorless. Really sad that a small mom and pop shop substitutes quality by not being able to fry an egg. The bagel was was the best part of the sandwich. Also, it looks like the business is against people's right to carry firearms... I guess I can no longer stop by because I don't leave home without mine..."}
{"text":"It was quite a thrill to discover an independent bagel shop in my neighborhood.  After having more than a few disappointing occasions at Einstein Brothers, I thought I would be banished to the land of grocery store bagels.  Luckily, I found back east bagels.  The bagels are FAR better than anything you will find in a grocery store or at Einsteins and their menu is very diverse making it a great place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"My husband raved about these bagels and brought some home for breakfast. The. Worst. Ever. Hard, dry, flavorless. Goo to Einstein's instead--you'll get a good bagel and your money's worth."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the Tempe area does not offer many deli/breakfast options (a primary feature about the East Coast that I miss). I tried this place because of the name and my desire to find an Arizona substitute for my favorite New York deli and bagel shops. The bagels are pretty decent, the spinach herb cream cheese is phenomenal, the \"Turkey Tempe\" is also pretty good. I was pleased with the service and have yet to find a comparable bagel shop in this area."}
{"text":"Other than being fairly expensive ($5-$7) for a customized bagel, I am usually a fan. The coffee selection is great, the employees are nice... the bagels aren't bad although I don't find them very filing for the price. It does have a cozy little interior, and is overall a pretty solid morning choice unless you are super picky about everything. Backeast has the perfect east coast character, mixed feelings."}
{"text":"I stop here about once a week on the way in to work in the morning- the breakfast bagels are very good (especially with the green chile cheddar bagel) but the espresso drinks could use  improvement."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and highly recommend it if you're a fan of savory bagels.
The first time I went here I had an everything bagel with cream cheese and a coffee. Both were very good. They have quite a few coffee options: 6 coffees and various creamers/milks, including vanilla half and half, which I used. I got my friend an egg and cheese on a bagel and everything seemed to be made fresh. 

I would not rate them 4 stars for the blueberry bagel I tried the next visit (though the strawberry cream cheese was very good). The coffee was, once again, very good. They also do free refills on the coffee, which is pretty fantastic. This time, I ate there and noticed they have some really interesting cream cheese flavors that I look forward to trying on future visits. 

The service was really nice both times. The people working here were enjoyable and the food was ready quickly."}
{"text":"Great REAL bagels. Not quite at the New York level but pretty close. Service was fantastic. Good coffee too.  We went back three days after our first visit and the woman taking our order remembered our order from our first visit. 
Place is quirky too with a decor featuring dozens of license plates - from many different states and countries. 
My only ding is the heavy cream cheese on the bagels - if you don't like your bagels smothered, you should ask them to go light on the cream cheese."}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast but have lived in AZ for a long time. Still- I miss the bagels back there and am so sick of Einsteins! I was happy to find a different bagel place nearby. They definitely aren't comparable to the east coast, but their bagels are a thousand times better than Einsteins and I definitely plan to be going back regularly as my go-to bagel place. I love their spinach herb cream cheese too!

The only reason I knocked off a point was that their eggs are microwaved instead of cooked. This is pretty much unheard of back east, but is how almost every bagel shop does it here. If  they had a grill I'd be over the moon! I've only found one place that fresh makes everything, but they are extremely far away. This however, is still an overall good bagel place that I recommend."}
{"text":"They have chocolate chip bagels and that's all you really need to know. I went there for the first time on Monday and it was pretty cute. They have a large menu and the people there seemed really nice."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm, so fresh and warm.  The best, five star!  Convenient location!  I totally recommended this place for fresh warm bagels."}
{"text":"They have the best bagels in this area!!!  I used to live super close and now live in Phoenix but I still make the drive because the bagels are that good!  So much better than any chain bagel place!"}
{"text":"15 years ago, the owners of Back East Bagels were old Jewish New York men whom moved out to AZ for arthritic reasons had opened up an outstanding bagel shop and it was wonderful. Kind nurturing dependable people. As with all good things they must come to an end. Some jerk bought the place messed with the recipe and now here we are. No it's not as good as it once was, but I will speak highly of the spinach herb cream cheese. But that's about it. Can't stand the owner, cocky weird and unfriendly. Why did he have to change the recipe, it was so delicious and great."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels, good customer service, clippings on the wall for upcoming concerts that I'm too broke to go to, but am glad that I am informed of them happening, so I can say \"Oh yeah I heard they were coming to town.\" thanks BEB for keeping me hip. Also pizza bagel."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to start reviewing for about the past year or so, since about the time I started using Yelp. I've had many great experiences since using the app, but let's say it took the worst to actually get me going.

Having just moved to Tempe from the East Coast, it would only be fitting that my wife and I jumped on a shop dubbed \"Back East\" bagels. I'm not sure which east they were referring to, possibly east Slovakia, but I have absolutely no problem with saying that this was the worst bagel I've ever eaten.

Tried the \"everything\" bagel with egg. I usually expect a bagel with a fried egg, so I ordered an extra egg b/c I was starving. I think the eggs must have been poured from a milk carton because they definitely didn't look like eggs, more like a pale yellow marshmallow fluff. It didn't help that I ordered the extra egg seeing as it came out standing about 4 inches high. (could of really used a heads up on that one)

I'll cut them a tiny bit of slack because it seems like they bake their bagels in-house and I can appreciate that. But they were burnt, and I mean really fried. Not just the everything bagels but the entire rack behind the counter. Back east bagels could definitely benefit from a little further research into the bagel industry and maybe a field trip back east to say...Brooklyn."}
{"text":"I admit that, being from NY, I hold a pretty high standard for bagels, and doubly so when a business makes reference to being from, or similar to New York style. On my way to the office this morning, I decided to give them a shot. I got three bagels, and once for my co-worker.

He didn't like his, but he's really negative, so I didn't pay him any mind, and I opened the bag for my two egg bagels. Nothing fancy, just some shmear. I noted that together, they were pretty much the size of a single one from anyone else, but I ignored that, too. 

The first thing that I noticed when it was unwrapped was that it was awfully brown and doughy. I understand that a toasted bagel would get tougher, but it was chewy and tough. Really unappetizing at seven in the morning. I took it for a horrible fluke, and I binned it. I couldn't eat it without my jaw popping. I took the other one, and I didn't even finish the first bite. It was practically inedible. I don't remember how much I paid, but it was entirely too much. 

I'm never going back. Yuck."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great quality ingredients and portion size. Bagels are superb. Prices on bagel sandwiches are a little high, and seem to keep creeping up (about $10 each with tax). Still a great place and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Closest to bagels from, well, back east. Great flavor- has that hint of sweetness that others miss. Would be four stars if the toppings (e.g., onion, sesame) were on both sides. Also, make them bigger and/or puffier! Solid find for anyone missing the right coast."}
{"text":"I really love the bagels at this place.  I'm from the east coast and it's nice to find a bagel shop that reminds me of home.

The only problem I have is that they are always out of coffee!  The hazelnut coffee is delicious, but whenever I go to serve myself, it's always out."}
{"text":"Awesome bagels!! Better than the big bagel companies. I will def go back again. Everyone was nice and there were fast getting my order done."}
{"text":"Having driven sadly by this place many times in the past (they close just when I need my afternoon caffeine fix), I finally got to eat here after suffering the misfortune of giving someone a ride early in the morning (9 am is early when you're in college!). Immediately I was a little let down by the customer service - the two girls behind the counter were so interested in their conversation that they couldn't stop to greet me as I walked in. They do have an incredible number of options, but most of the flavors of bagels I wanted to try were out. I decided on a honey whole wheat bagel with strawberry cream cheese and a large coffee. I was pleased that there were many options for brewed coffee - they didn't just put out a pot of Folgers and call it a day. Also nice was the carafe of soy milk to put in your coffee, something I've never seen. Disappointing - the lack of to go lids for the coffee cups. The bagel itself was great - tough outside, delightfully chewy inside, definitely not what you pick up at the grocery store or even at Einstein Bros. The cream cheese was a let down though - it had little flavor and was pretty runny (thankfully they included a napkin in my to go bag). I will be back when I get the chance, but I won't be quitting Einstein for Back East anytime soon."}
{"text":"We've been looking for bagels that taste like home ever since we moved to California from Boston 7 years ago. It took moving to Tempe to find them, however, and I'm never getting a chain bagel again."}
{"text":"Here is my issue.  I come every Sunday between 10-11am and the bagels are pretty much gone.  I could see if it was closer to closing time.  I don't get it.  Today I left before ordering because there were virtually no bagels to buy.  At the bagel store.  This is pretty common.  Please, make more bagels!"}
{"text":"Back East Bagels is the place to go for bagels in Phoenix. Being from New York, I can confidently say that Back East Bagels knows what they're doing.  Other bagel stores don't hold a candle to their selection!! On top of that, everyone from the owner to the delivery runners are professional, courteous, and genuinely concerned about their customers' satisfaction. If you are in Phoenix, you should be at Back East Bagels for breakfast and lunch! :)"}
{"text":"I like this place, but they seriously need to learn to better forecast demand. They NEVER have garlic bagels and are always out of several types. Today I was going to buy two sandwiches on garlic bagels, but I'm so tired of them always being out of garlic that I just gave up and walked out."}
{"text":"Relatively unknown, but everything there is amazing. Everyone that works there is so friendly too. Try the cinnamon and sugar bagel. Awesome"}
{"text":"My wife and I go for brunch often. We like their sandwiches. Go early for the best selection. Staff is friendly and fast. Dog friendly patio our pup's love their puppy bagel."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful discovery. I needed coffee & breakfast when I was in this area for a business meeting and found Back East Bagels. The bagels are delicious and there are a lot of choices. You can get the full range of espresso drinks hot or cold! The decor is clean & charming- fun without that self-consciously hip feeling. And the audio selection this morning: The Cars! Great spot. Great neighborhood feel, great food."}
{"text":"Great New York style bagel! Better than Chompies and far better than Einsteins wonderbread. I ordered the everything with cream cheese. I'll give 5 stars if you add salt to the everything bagel mix."}
{"text":"Bagels are fresh, hot, and the service is amazing. Walk-in, order your little Delights, and Wallah exquisiteness in a basket!!"}
{"text":"A great mom and pop type shop. Fresh bagels, friendly service, fun café type of atmosphere. Their dining area consists of large dining tables, all different types. My favorite bagel is the multi-grain. It has this amazing sweet and healthy oat flavor and it's very dense and filling. I get mine not toasted with their veggie cream cheese. I'm usually a little scared to eat veggie cream cheese just because you never know what's in it. This one is scrumptious, super creamy, fresh and refreshing, and has a bit of a crunch. There are carrots and probably a little celery (not a lot though, I don't like celery and I can't even taste it in here), and I'm not sure what else. Very good; I really like it here and I like supporting a small local business."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 breakfast Turkey Sausage bagels to go twice. Server had to redo and was told by the owner to stop chatting and concentrate. The result?  Two still incorrect sandwiches. Who puts sliced turkey on a breakfast sandwich with egg and cheese when it's not even on the menu?"}
{"text":"Bagel (cheese) was okay.  Ordered two scones - one pumpkin and one cranberry orange.  Both could have been used as door stops.  Simply awful.  Stay far from the scones - if you need/want a bagel - they are okay.  And, for the record, the staff should at the very least have their hair tied back.  It was nearly covering the person face who was handling my food!  YUK!"}
{"text":"Great local bagel place.  Very friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"Microwave bagels?? What a joke very overrated bagel place I gave it one star because the coffee was ok they had real milk but frys bagels are better and Thai not saying much"}
{"text":"Nothing like driving completely out of your way to a New York bagel
Place asking for a over easy egg
You know cause that's what they do in ny
Oh no the only to microwaved scramble here
Nothing about this place is back eats
I could have drove a mile vs the 12 out of my way and gotten a cheaper bagel w mire then shred of bacon"}
{"text":"I just had the worst breakfast and lunch bagel sandwich's in my life.  The bagels do not taste fresh...dry!  
I had Reuben sandwich and also an Egg with Cheese sandwich - positively the worst I ever had.  I was in a hurry and starving so I ate most of it... but it was an unpleasant chore.  :(  I know bagel sandwiches, and usually they are a real treat - but not here.  I am from back east and a true bagel shop's sandwiches are lushously mouthwatering - to-die-for delicious.  Not here!  Save your money and Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I won't be back.  Just bought traditional lox on an egg bagel.  There's more tomato on it than lox and very few capers.  Not a good value considering the price.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"When you move to AZ from NYC, there are three things that you will miss and be constantly in search of, good bagels (not bread with a hole but real authentic Jewish bagels), pizza, and Chinese food. These are 3 essential food items that the average New Yorker takes for granted until they move to the desert. After years of searching I found a decent bagel place, still not quite NYC level but as close as you will get, NY Bagels and Bialys on North Scottsdale road. This place satisfies my bagel cravings but unfortunately, I don't get to go there often because it is miles away from my house and miles away from where I work. In an attempt to find an adequate replacement I stumbled upon Back East Bagels. Their bagels are okay. They are NOT New York bagels, or even back east bagels for that matter, I've had better bagels in Detroit, but they are better than Einstein's (this is not a stretch since Einstein's doesn't even serve REAL bagels). 

Anyway, because of proximity to home and work I have been going to Back East Bagels for years and I have to say that every time I leave there feeling like I'd much rather be giving my business to someone else. I don't know if it's the service or the small portions but truthfully I always leave with a slight regret. Today I made the decision once and for all that I will not be returning to Back East bagels. 

I was running late for work and wanted to make a quick stop to pick up something quick to eat. I was craving a bagel with lox and cream cheese so I called Back East Bagels and asked if I could place a to go order. The girl on the phone told me that they don't take to-go orders on the weekends.  Not quite understanding her explanation I said okay and hung up. Since I was headed in that direction anyway I decided to stop by the store to order in-person. When got there I asked the cashier, \"could you explain to me why you won't take a to-go order over the phone?\" The girl I spoke with earlier was there and she responded by saying that it's because they reserve the weekend for catering orders and it gets too busy to take phone orders. 

Let me just say, her explanation made NO friggin sense on several levels. First of all, it's 7:30 Friday morning, in case they didn't get the memo, the weekend for most people starts Friday evening and goes through Sunday evening. Also, what's the difference between taking a phone order and taking an order in-person and how does it take up any more of your time? You still have to stop to take the order if a person comes into the store to place it. As for them being too busy on the weekends, when I arrived there were no lines out the door, and there was no one standing at the register, the phone wasn't ringing off the hook, there were a few seated customers and I walked right up to the register. I pointed this out to the cashier and she seemed at a loss for how to respond.

Meanwhile, while this discussion was happening the owner was in the back and he overheard the entire conversation. Did he stop what he was doing to come out to offer his customer an articulate explanation? No, he just sat in the back and let his employees, young girls, perhaps ASU students, not fully able to articulate the boss' reasoning,  deal with the inquiry. The conversation was going nowhere and I had to get to work so I hastily ordered my bagel.  I was still visibly annoyed when the owner called my name to tell me that my order was ready but rather than taking the opportunity to explain his policy further,  he handed me my order and condescendingly offered, \"Have a nice day.\" 

On the way to the car, I checked my order and when I looked down at the clear container I noticed a small bagel with two sad little pieces of lox, no onions, no tomatoes, no capers. Considering that I spent $9.48 for this meager meal I went back in and asked why there wasn't anything else on it. The girl at the counter (she by the way was the only one that was very friendly and sincerely accommodating) told me that I had to specify that I wanted the other items and that it would be 25 cents more. GTFOH, Are you kidding me with this place?"}
{"text":"This wdefinitely a disappointment. The bagels are decent, I guess. But no where near a true \"back east bagel\". I ordered my bagel with strawberry cream cheese and it tasted exactly like Philadelphia cream cheese, bleh."}
{"text":"Very yummy bagels and coffee. The breakfast sandwiches are yummy but I am a sucker for the bagels and cream cheese. $2.77 is a bargain. Try the hazel nut coffee it is so yummy and gets you going in the morning."}
{"text":"I went here a few times recently while visiting my family in Tempe. I have to say, their coffee is awful, their smoothies are watered down and you're better off buying frozen packaged bagels from your local grocery store. These bagels are awful. \"Back East Bagels\" it is not! Why would they call themselves that? They should change the name. And what a rip off! Save your money or go support a more honest business. The owner at Back East is a pervert and also hostile to the customers. I've seen it with my own eyes! God forbid someones coffee gets knocked out of their hands by someone that wasn't paying attention. It will piss the owner off if you dare ask for another cup. He will expect you to pay for it, unless of course you are female and wearing something tight with your boobs falling out, then he is all for it. Also, the young blonde girl that works at the counter is not very bright. Got my order wrong twice! Is a sesame bagel with cream cheese really that hard to figure out?! Yeah. Don't bother with this place. There's a nice coffee shop across the street though."}
{"text":"Ordered a bagel with egg and cheese, the lady got the order wrong gave me a bagel with cheese I told them I ordered one with egg. 
Instead of remaking the bagel she burned the cheese and put the egg on. It tasted disgusting! Worst tasting bagel I ever had! I went back around noon time to get my money back she did give me a refund. But she acted as if she did nothing wrong. I had to tell her burnt cheese on bagels are disgusting the young lady disagreed I had to tell her twice! I  also told her just because someone corrects you on their order you messed up you shouldn't purposely burn their food. The old lady co worker was looking surprised. To them it's ok to treat customers like crap.  I don't think that's fair. I  use to live back east in Pennsylvania and ny to me that did not taste like a back east bagel."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find good bagels in Scottsdale, so my roommate and I ventured to Tempe to satiate our cravings.

We both got the open-faced bagel, cream cheese and lox.  It was excellent and fresh.  The bagel was chewy without being too bread-like.  The lox was fresh and high quality.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on the way to work after the gym.  I love the bagels they are the perfect size.  I tend to get peanut butter, but changed it up.  I got a light spread of cream cheese this time.  They are open at a good time too.  I have had there sandwiches too.  They are pretty good also.  I think they changed their cookies though.  They seem a bit different.  If I could make a suggestion.  I wish they would add Nutella to their toppings.  Other than that it is yummy."}
{"text":"I Decided to stop by here out of desperation of not being able to find anything remotely healthy in the area.

I ordered one of their salads with cranberries, feta cheese, and vinaigrette.  the salad was good and the services was great.

Its nice to find a small business that cares about quality and their customers.  

I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place has very good bagels and cheap prices as well ! The staff is friendly and it's a cozy environment ! It's different than Einstein bagels, same concept and different taste but a good taste ! 

There is usually always a line in the morning that goes out the door, but it moves at a decent speed."}
{"text":"On a serious tip, this place has the BEST potato salad I've had in a deli in YEARS. Oh my word, it is super delicious and big chunks of potato, not just gloopy mayo or mustard.

I got their reuben bagel with hot pastrami and sauerkraut and it was a divine revelation of flavor that made my mouth and belly sing. So good. I will crave these for quite some time. AND their pickles are amazing and flavorful -- MUCH MUCH MUCH better than Chompie's.

You want a great deli lunch with bagels, hit this place up."}
{"text":"The service here is quick and friendly and the bagels are delicious, you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Tasty bagels! I don't go out of my way to come here but when I'm near I do make a stop! I find the bagels are fresh and tasty! I love me some veggie cream cheese but wasn't a big fan of there's ...it was more like a chive cream cheese instead :/ .    My BF got the pizza bagel which was pretty decent!

They have a good deal on a box of bagels and cream cheese which would be good to bring to the office if you looking for something other then donuts for like 20$ something bucks! Worth checking  out if you are near by!"}
{"text":"This place was average/good. I enjoyed the coffee much more than the bagel. The service was good. Pretty average bagel shop, in my opinion. Would go back, but not my top choice for breakfast"}
{"text":"These bagels complete every morning for me they are AMAZING and the workers are very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ."}
{"text":"I go here once a week, being from the east coast they don't compare,but for out here there pretty good. Better than the three and a half score they currently have. Nice staff too."}
{"text":"Back East is, well, not back East quality as I know it. I really do detest New York (except for the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but I have to say that the best bagel I have ever had was there. Back East is at least better than the limp sticky things from Einstein's, IMHO. 

I worked very near here for many years, and I would have to say that their lunch fare was better than breakfast. Their eggs are microwaved in a disposable plastic container, and I always pictured tiny little carcinogens gleefully nestling into my morning protein. I swear that the majority of the time, the early morning staff was in serious need of a caffeine jolt. Mmmmm, how I loved having some slitty eyed college girl yawn in my face and not cover her mouth. Wake up, bitch, and get my order right, for once!

Lunch was far better with a wide variety of quality bagel sandwiches, so satisfying and filling I would never be tempted by the snacks in the breakroom for the rest of the afternoon. The BLT was super yum, with cream cheese, sprouts, and cucumbers as well as the B, the L, and the T.

Drinks are are a little pricey, and I always found the coffee to be just alright. The best cup in the immediate area is Gold Bar, but in the direction I came, it was a bigger pain to get to most mornings. You have worse options in the AM on the corner of Southern and McClintock than Back East Bagels."}
{"text":"These bagels are an absolute joke. Not sure what part of the east Coast this shop is from, but it's not NY. Walking in, most of the bins were pretty empty at 10am, but these are fool's bagels. They are the size of a bottlecap and the hole in the middle is triple the size of any real NY bagel. Must be students buying these imposters because one look at these bagels was all I needed as I quickly escaped this \"bagel\" shop and headed for the hills. Embarrasing to have east coast on the marquee - I'm glad it doesn't say NY bagels at least."}
{"text":"8 bucks and change for 4 mediocre bagels and some disgusting strawberry cream cheese.. No thanks.. Not again"}
{"text":"Very good bagels, very fresh, many choices. The coffee is very good. They have lox and cream cheese that is super fresh, my Mom really liked. Nice atmosphere, inside or my boyfriend and I like to sit outside, we love to go for a early Sunday morning chill. Coffee is less expensive than Starbucks and very good blend for on way to work during the week. Like that they are a Local business."}
{"text":"Great breakfast bagels .....perfect way to start your morning....moist bread and melted cheese ;)"}
{"text":"I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being."}
{"text":"Very disappointed #1 it is not a back east bagel #2 they don't have Taylor ham #3 extremely dirty #4  I found  hair on my bagel"}
{"text":"5 stars for making the best possible bagels while not having access to the east coast resources. 

Bagels are pretty damn good, and their breakfast sandwiches are top notch. Their coffee is good too."}
{"text":"Recieved a stale bagel with almost no cream cheese on it and hardly toasted. This place puts any east coast bakery to shame, or any bakery for that matter."}
{"text":"I have to thank Georgie for his recent review, otherwise I might not have known this place existed.  I was talking with my buddy Tim a few weeks ago about low carb diets, so what does that make me immediately crave?  BREAD.  After I read Georgie's review I realized I can't think of the last time I've had a good bagel.  

After two visits to Back East I can say they are definitely good to great, but not better than The Bagel Man.  Back East's bagels are light and chewy and the breakfast sandwiches are pretty good.  I love a good cinnamon sugar bagel and thank God I discovered this joint so I never have to step foot in an Einstein Bros. again.  The first cinnamon sugar bagel I had at Back East was absolutely perfect and was almost like eating a cinnamon roll without the icing.  I love that they put the cinn/sug all over the bagel, not just on top.

I ordered another one this morning and it was a bit smaller and harder on one side.  I'm sure it's difficult to make them all the same all the time, but the one today just wasn't as light and tasty as the one I had the other day.

This morning I got the breakfast sandwich with the green chile cheddar bagel and that is a delicious bagel as well!  I've never tried one before, but I really enjoyed that and I heard a lot of people ordering it while I was in the shop.  

To accompany my breakfast I ordered a blended mocha and they do give you your choice of milk and with or without whipped cream.  For $3.99 it's a large drink, but I thought the flavor was kind of weak and for a blended drink there were quite a few pieces of ice still in it.  That drink was just a 2.5/5 for me.  They do have a lot of choices for coffee drinks so I'm sure I can find something I like better the next time.  

Overall I'm definitely a fan and would come back.  I'd much rather patronize a place like this than the chains.  They have great deals on large purchases and a wide variety of lunch sandwiches as well."}
{"text":"We were in the area for swim lessons and I wanted a bagel instead of the norm starbucks.  

I had the jalapeño bagel with cheese and egg, it was good but needed some sort of sauce. They had mayo so I add a tiny bit. I think this place is cute and has personality. I wish we had something like this in the laveen area."}
{"text":"Always quick, always hot and fresh. Great staff too. Always smiling! Love this local restaurant."}
{"text":"As usual great food but as with most visits music is too loud have to shout to talk over it"}
{"text":"Four and Three Quarter Stars, bordering on Five. 

Yes, they're that close to being the real thing.

Coming from the east coast, we're always on the look out for a good bagel or bialy(sorry, bagels only) place.  Here, they are doing a great job.  

I might offer up what a east coast bagel is not.  It is not a bagel larger then your fist.  Those over sized doughy things you find at Einstein's are not east coast bagels and they don't have a hole in the middle like a donut.  Bagel should have a hard, glossy brown exterior with a soft interior.  Here, that's what you get.

Soooo if you are following along at home, we have three really good places that offer a decent bagels in the Valley.  In order of preference:

{"text":"Had my first and last visit. Got the breakfast bagel with sausage which was ok. Nothing spectacular. Everything bagel got an ok as well from my other half. What ruined the experience for me was the customer service. The first person you're in contact with sets the precedence for the entire business. The brunette at the register was cold, unfriendly, had absolutely no personality and gave off the vibe that she hated her job. I thought it was just me but I watched her with the other customers and not once did she even try to crack a smile or be friendly. New flash: Just because you've memorized a customers' order doesn't mean you have customer service skills. If you hate your job so much then quit because it's people like you who make customers like us go elsewhere. I saw the manager come out so I mentioned to him that the girl at the register needs some personality and that she is rude when you first walk in. I don't know if I caught him off guard or what but the response I got was \"oh okay\". Really? Instead of saying I'm sorry about that. I'd rather go to Einsteins."}
{"text":"Tried to go but stood at the counter and waited for someone to take my order.  After waiting a couple if minutes, and no service, I ended up leaving and went across the street."}
{"text":"The bagels are really amazing and so is the service. Obviously, when it's busy its going to be a while but overall, its a really good place for breakfast and a lot better than the other places in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Eat here occasionally but not that great.  I actually think I prefer Einstein bagels and their iced tea...embarrassing as that is."}
{"text":"Best bagels I've had here in the entire Valley.  Always really fresh bagels and offer breakfast and lunch dishes at good prices."}
{"text":"Got a pumpernickel bagel with spinach cream cheese.. So good! Customer service was great. Also got a doggie bagel for my pup."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great ambiance, wide selection and tasty food. My favorite neighborhood bagel and coffee place!"}
{"text":"Back East Bagels is one of my favorite places for a quick breakfast! So much better than Einstein and other fast breakfast places. The bagels are fresh and they have such a great selection on their menu and so much variety in what they offer. Everyone is so friendly and it is very efficient. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I come here basically once a week, right before I go grocery shopping next door. The bagels are delicious. Clearly home made, baked fresh, and a lot of variety. Most of the bagels are vegan, and I'll get them with either peanut butter or hummus, or the one sandwich without cream cheese and just extra hummus as a substitute.

The staff is very nice, coffee is good, restaurant is clean. I've not one complaint"}
{"text":"Offering a hearty selection of breakfast items including pastries, bagels, and sandwiches, BEB is often on my radar when looking for a morning meal in Tempe. 

What I like:
*Good number of bagel choices
*Bright, quaint location, with outdoor seating
*Friendly staff
*Prices are comparable to Einstein's

What needs work:
*The actual bagel quality can sometimes be hit or miss. My bagel is sometimes big and fluffy; other times it's wimpy and haggard by the cutting blade. 

Overall, there's nothing strongly beckoning me to BEB, other than it's close to my work, and they serve breakfast foods. Depending on my available time and money, I would probably spend a little more to go somewhere with better quality. If I'm trying to save a dollar, I'd probably go with a very cheap breakfast somewhere else. That being said, I've liked every encounter with BEB bagels. Their bagels and breakfast sandwiches do the job. So, I will continue to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Best bagel and iced coffee I've had! love the location and atmosphere. Overall very good!"}
{"text":"The bagels were very bland. I have tried a chocolate chip bagel with plain cream cheese and a plain bagel with egg and cheddar. The chocolate chip bagel had almost no flavor, even with the chocolate chips. The cream cheese was also bland, not like most places (and I love cream cheese!!). The egg and cheddar bagel was also tasteless- this is another one of my go-to's when I get bagels and usually one of my favorites. I did enjoy the ice coffee tho, good price and the size is large!! Over all would not come back for a third time and would not recommend"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to find a good bagel and lox these days? I really wanted a good small non-chain bagel place to go to (read: not Einstein's) to go to with some good bagels and quality lox to have. I had high hopes for this place that would take me back to when I would get bagels with my grandpa back in Boston but this place failed. I have tried twice now hoping that maybe it was just the bagel i got or the day I went but same result over priced for mediocre quality. The bagels didn't have much flavor and were over toasted, the lox was bland and way to slimy and seemed like it was the cheap stuff from Costco (not even there good stuff).

The only good thing was that the creamy cheese was well flavored and the tomatoes seemed fresh. For a near $10 price tag though I was very underwhelmed and actually preferred the bagels and lox at Einstien's. I guess I will keep trying in my search."}
{"text":"Love Back East Bagels!

I came here for the first time today with my boyfriend. We are always looking for some  east coast food (originally from New York) and decided to try it out. 

The atmosphere is very friendly and inviting. The place was filled today with regulars and after eating here today we are going to be regulars too! 

I had a breakfast bagel with bacon, egg and cheese on a jalapeño bagel. Delicious! 
He had a sesame bagel with strawberry cream cheese. The cream cheese was very sweet and way better than anything store bought. 

We came early and watched the sun rise on the patio which was very relaxing. 

This is a great place and I highly recommend anyone who loves the east coast and bagels to come here!"}
{"text":"The bagel was average. The Mexican polka music was not appreciated and shortly after I started eating my bagel the place filled with the smell of burnt bagel. They really need to clean the crumbs out of the bagel toaster more often. I probably will not return."}
{"text":"Our favorite bagel spot in the area! Mmm.. It makes my mouth water just thinking about their bagels. The way they spread their cream cheese.. Oh man!"}
{"text":"Great bagels, but why do you MICROWAVE eggs? We do not microwave eggs in New York. You guys go through all the trouble to boil your own bagels (which you do a pretty good job at), and then you go throw some nuked eggs on them. Terrible ownership choice - simply putting an open Paganini grill in your line solves that problem. Grill your eggs and meat!!! Not acceptable to a New Yorker.... maybe for those who will settle for mediocre taste. The coffee is good, even lunch meals are tasty. I just can't get over a place calling themself an \"east coast\" business but they miss one of the most important parts."}
{"text":"Get there early, we have showned up twice about half an hour to an hour before closing and there is a very limited selection, which I understand. I love their green Chile cheddar bagel but we have gotten an assorted variety and the sizes and shapes of each individual bagel vary significantly, I am not very experienced with gourmet bagel shops so I do not know if this is a normal practice or if I get the runt of the litter because that's all they have left. I come to this location for convenience since I do business in this area every week but will definitely try one other famous bagel shop close by to compare their consistency and might update my review upon further research."}
{"text":"I had been boycotting this place for selling stale bagels.  The mother law bought a dozen and decided to send the extra bagels home with us.  She did it out of love but it reminded my why I don't go here anymore.  Out of the 4 varieties she bought one was fresh.  The other three very old.  I'm sure they where great the day they baked them.  By the time my family purchased them and I ate it not so good.  I did have a garlic bagel that was fresh so that proves they do make the bagels daily.  MY guess is they make the variety they are out of and if your lucky to shop there that day you win."}
{"text":"I have never been let down by Back East Bagels. I feel completely comfortable just sitting and enjoying my food without being bustled out. Food is perfection and decently priced compared to other bagel/breakfast joints. 

I've heard some people complain that they do not offer wifi. I enjoy this but I know others want to be plugged in. 

Also, coffee options are amazing. 6 different roasts and flavors and a variety of creamers. You know..if you're into that."}
{"text":"The bagels here are fantastic! The process they do to make them makes the bagels very moist and easy to eat. Also the homemade cream cheese is to die for. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very good bagels with a hint of back east charm (small and a bit worn down).  Love the Sunflower bagels, not sure what makes it so tasty but Yum!!"}
{"text":"I would say 2.5 here. Went at 7:30 in the morning to get a bagel and coffee. After ordering and being handed an empty cup with no lid, I had a feeling I was going to get 7-11 grade coffee. And I sure did. The coffee was weak and watery and not flavorful. 

My bagel order was a jalapeño bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. Let me tell you this bagel was thin and stale and the cream cheese was runny and had no kick to it. It was a sad bagel to be honest, I feel bad for saying this. If you're going to call yourself Back East Bagels, you'd better live up to the name. If you think you are going to get the flavorful fluffy/chewy crispy bagels and fresh whippy cream cheese because of the name, you're in for a disappointment. You may be put off if you know what proper bagels taste like. 

And please turn down your late 70's butt rock album. It is obnoxious and noisy at 7:30 in the morning."}
{"text":"I am originally from New York so I was skeptical at first but the bagels are amazing, better than any I've tried in Arizona. Truthfully, I've only visited once, but when I arrived at 11:30am on Monday morning the sesame bagels were just coming out of the oven. I had one with lox cream cheese and an americano. The cream cheese is thinner than I expected but still delicious. The whole meal was just like I remembered from home.

I also loved how they were playing Cyndi Lauper's greatest hits as I ate. I forgot how positive all of her music is. The location is small, and in a mini mall near Sprouts, Sally's, and the Goodwill. A nice little mom and pop shop with excellent bagels.

update: I've been back several times and it's still delicious. I haven't caught the fresh bagels again, but I now know that they have vanilla soy milk available for your coffee. So if you're lactose intolerant, REJOICE! You can enjoy a regular old coffee with cream in it without an upcharge (I never understood why other coffee shops charge extra for soy milk anyways)."}
{"text":"Reminds me of back home in Brooklyn, great bagels , specialty cream cheese. Great coffee, tea, snacks and sandwiches galore. Highly recommended this place for breakfast or lunch. Owner Mark is very nice and great staff he has. A pleasure every time I go there, and I drive all they way from up north from Fountain Hills just to get the great experience. Again a must stop and see."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to bagel place, but it's decreased in quality significantly over the last year. The bagels have gotten smaller and smaller. They look like they were shrunk in the dryer. I thought it was a random occurrence but every time the bagels are small and thin now. They're also kind of hard. I'm pretty sad to see this place go downhill."}
{"text":"Pretty good bagels for Arizona.  Definitely remind me of New York bagels."}
{"text":"Bagels are okay, I've had better and I've had worse.  The real star of the show is their raspberry chocolate coffee.  It is out of this world delicious!  

I've never had a great interaction from the staff.  I usually go early in the morning and there is an older gentleman working, presumably the manager or owner, he is always in a bad mood and I believe that sets the tone for the rest of the staff because they all seem unhappy to be there."}
{"text":"Not exactly close to ASU, but definitely has a college vibe to it. You can pick up brochures to join the local chapter of Amnesty International, New Times, and see an age range from parents with kids, to groups of older men meeting for coffee and breakfast, to college kids with their books.

I also appreciate establishments that don't play canned Clear Channel or satellite radio and allow the staff to choose the music. When I was there Sunday they were playing \"The Queen Is Dead\" from The Smiths. You certainly wouldn't hear that at Einstein's.

My favorite breakfast bagel sandwich is the \"August 22, 1988\" for $4.99 (Chili Tapin Sauce, Egg, Sausage, & Pepper Jack Cheese). It's named after the day the Phoenix Cardinals made their debut. (I had assumed that was the hottest recorded day in Phoenix, but was incorrect).  The Chili sauce definitely gives it a swift kick to your tongue. A great breakfast bagel sandwich for that enjoy it on the spicy side.

They have your basic fare as well, and lunch sandwiches and salads.

I want to also agree with Alexandra K. and cheer for the salt bagel. It seems to be disappearing from most bagel shops so I'm thankful they have kept theirs."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. Used to go here every morning when I started working in the area, but now more. I used to be able to get a coffee and bagel sandwich for just over $5, today that would cost me $7.50 plus. The coffee is okay, and the bagel sandwiches are okay (for a microwaved egg with bacon and cheese), but not even close to what you pay for them. 

Truthfully I can actually get a bagel and coffee cheaper at Starbucks, or Gold Bar, or Coffee Buzz, or crap food at McDonald's, or crap food at Taco Bell...........you see where I'm going here? With this much competition, as well as a Sprouts, within walking distance you would think they would want to, you know, be competitive. 

That said I'll be taking my business elsewhere and you should to."}
{"text":"They NEVER have plain bagels when I go. What bagel shop never has enough plain bagels on a Saturday or Sunday morning? Drives me nuts and has happened on 3 separate occasions."}
{"text":"I've seen this place multiple times and finally had the opportunity to stop in. I ordered the Breakfast August Egg and an iced coffee. Very quick service and a great, spicy bagel. The vanilla coffee is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Best bagels you can get in AZ and their crumb coffee cake - I'm pretty sure I gain weight every time I look at it. 

Very friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"I love this place I go after going to church and I get their pizza bagel I love it soooooooo much keep it up guys !!!!!"}
{"text":"Every Sunday growing up, my dad would get the family bagels from Back East.  My sister and I looked forward to every Sunday just for that reason.  I love their bagels and cream cheese and their bagel sandwiches.  Now that I have moved back in the area, Back East is super close again.  Their fresh squeezed OJ is great, and they have a fantastic array of bagel flavors.  The one thing that bugs me sometimes is if you come as late as 9am, lots of the bagel flavors are already sold out.  They usually aren't replaced once they are gone.  I came in once only to find that they were out of all the flavors my hubby and I liked, so I had to walk right back out."}
{"text":"They have such great tasting bagels & take it from someone who doesn't exactly like bagels. I get my bagel toasted with strawberry cream cheese & it's amazing. I can't understand why it would have bad reviews because their bagels are DELICIOUS. The only reason why I didn't give them five stars is because their drinks are a little pricey for what they taste like."}
{"text":"i rarely have or take the time to review restaurants & when I do, it is good. But I need to make an exception here.  I have to agree with Andrew & friends must be writing in about the great service.  There is one nice kid that works there--I know he plays in a band on the side--but the rest need to be trained in how to deal with the public--never have been overly friendly like in most restaurants which welcome your business.  I live very close & been going there for years but they often do not announce the food up, for one.  It is delivered way at the back end of the counter, only visible from maybe half or less of the restaurant & certainly not from the patio.  I learned a long time ago, after my food just sat there for 10 minutes to keep an eye on this area.  I visited recently at 2:50pm (10 minutes before close), almost all the bagels were put away & I was not allowed to eat there.  I watched 2 people come in separately thereafter. The last guy (just before I walked out) was told they were CLOSED.  I looked at my cell--it was 2:57pm...granted it was close, but I would have NEVER turned that guy away...I think they let him in for a coffee finally...cardinal sin, in my case....the food is decent...I would love to see the ownership address this, because I have frequented this place far less lately due to the service & it is natural for me to go over there..."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than a fresh bagel on a Sunday morning from Back East.  Truly the best.  The quality far exceeds Einsteins, Breuggers or anything you pick up at the grocery store.  They are on par with Chompies, but I still favor Back East... mostly because they also have great bagel sandwiches and their staff is friendly and quick.  Just an overall great local business."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Sunday on our way onto the highway. The place was clean and overall good service. But the bagel breakfast sandwich itself was okay at best. The turkey sausage didn't even cover half of the sandwich. The Cheese was unmelted. Not inedible . But not a very impressive breakfast Sammie either."}
{"text":"I really love finding new bagel joins to try out. Ever since I moved to Tempe I've been looking for a great bagel place close to me, but this one just misses the mark. Small bagels, dense dough, microwaved egg, ham and cheese, and cheap ham at that. Breakfast sandwich for $5 is quite standard for a non-fast food place, but it didn't really taste much better than a fast food breakfast sandwich. There are many better bagel places in the valley...probably won't be coming back.
Had no problems with the staff."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast august egg. Really good, but not as spicy as I thought, but keep in mind I like 5 hot when it comes to Thai food. Good customer service and people are nice. Music is medium so you can still talk."}
{"text":"i am revising my review of back east and embarrassed to be duchess of this place. i first loved this place because of their vanilla half and half. that was until one day, when coming near closing time, i realized it was fat free vanilla coffeemate! their service continues to go downhill- how many times to i need to get attitude from someone before i decide that einstein's is actually better?  last time we went, they were out of ice and soda, yet my friend was sold a cold cup with no argument. we have changed our weekly bagel brekkie to bagel nosh- i'd rather drive to awahtukee and have someone be happy i'm dining at their restaurant and have decent sandwiches-other than the veggie sandwich, back east fails miserably,imo. i hope someone that works here and/or management reads this and realizes that they pretty much just lost 3 of their best customers.."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would! I went in and got a Lox bagel sandwich yesterday morning and by  late afternoon I have never been sicker!!!  This has been the worst 24hrs. Don't get the Lox!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels and coffee! Great selection of sandwiches for breakfast and lunch! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'd give Back East Bagels 4.5 stars if I could! The staff is friendly, makes great suggestions, and is quick in making your order. They have a lot of variety, both in bagels, coffee drinks, and other drinks. The atmosphere is calm, yet vibrant. And most importantly, the bagels are absolutely delicious. Savory sandwiches, or sweet spreads on fresh bagels, nothing I've gotten here has disappointed!

P.S. a dozen bagels is half off after 1pm :)"}
{"text":"I was here a few Saturdays ago - around 8:30am. They were sold out of about 2/3 if their bagel selection and the employee at the counter made it sound like they would close once they ran out. It's a bagel shop! Shouldn't they be able to start making new stock when they're running low so early in the morning?? 

That aside, the bagel I did get was good and they Honey Walnut Raisin (or similar name) cream cheese was delicious. 

I'll try it again and hope their bagel supply issue was a fluke."}
{"text":"Bagels are fresh and tasty. Good selection of bagel sandwiches and panini sandwiches. The best thing about this place is the people behind the counter. Always a smile and a greeting no matter how busy they get!"}
{"text":"Another experience so upsetting it warranted a 2 star review. I went in ordered my choc chip bagel with plain cream cheese and sat down hoping to enjoy my Saturday morning. Took a few bites of my  choc chip bagel and realized something was missing, CHOCOLATE CHIPS!!!!!!! After tearing the bagel into sections, (in order to see if i had gone insane) I brought my order back to the young guy at the counter and explained the error on their behalf. 

This is were it became truly infuriating, he looked at the sections of chocolate chip-less bagel and tried to LIE TO MY FACE about how the chips get mixed in with the batter and somehow dissipate into invisible  bagel oblivion. Insulting the intelligence of your customers is a cardinal sin in my book. If he had just owned up to it and been a man about his mistake, this review would have been drastically different. 

I am willing to try this place again and retract my low score, but it better be damn good bagel or i'm going back to Einstein's."}
{"text":"Here is the thing about back east bagels. They have the best bagels in az. I am from back east I know. These are legit. The problem is most of the time they are selling day olds that are stale. When you catch a fresh bagel it is paradise.  I think it's criminal to say you are back east style and sell old stuff. In jersey that wouldn't be tolerated. The locals would complain and not go back. In Tempe there are zero alternatives so I deal. But it really makes my blood boil."}
{"text":"Always good service.  Bagels are delicious but the cream cheese mixes are the best.  The roasted jalapeno cheddar cheese is spicy, but the chive is our favorite.  

The sandwiches are huge and they also offer coffee and smoothies as well as some pastries.  Great place for breakfast, but also great for lunch.

half off after 1pm  I think"}
{"text":"SALT BAGEL! SALT BAGEL! SALT BAGEL! + LOX!!!

Pick me up a bagel and some OJ from this place and I tell you what- it's gonna be a goooooooood day :)"}
{"text":"the bagels are freshly made and so is the cream cheese and i can taste the difference, cute coffee shop environment"}
{"text":"I've noticed Back East Bagels for years while getting coffee at Xtreme Bean across the street, and finally made it in the day after Halloween. 

This place was rockin'. Cyclists dropping in for a post-ride bagel and coffee, folks about to do their shopping at Sprouts, ASU students still in trashy Halloween costumes + make-up from the night before.

I only tried a Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with their seasonal Pumpkin Cream Cheese.

Friendly and quick service from the employees, even though the store was totally packed.

The bagel wasn't the size of a Chihuahua, but not the size of drink coaster either. Just right. 

It was still piping hot when I got home, toasted perfectly while still being chewy, and believe it or not, the Pumpkin Cream Cheese with the perfect compliment to Cinnamon Raisin. 

Wish these guys sold that stuff by the tub! 

Never lived on the East Coast, never even visited, so I don't know what constitutes a bagel from there. 

But I do know a good bagel when I bite into one, and this was it!"}
{"text":"I love being able to hit up a local joint for my Sunday morning bagel fix. Everything I have had has been good and service awesome. I do however find their jalapeño bagel very tame."}
{"text":"DO NOT order the SCONES and if you do ask when they were made.  I did and they were HARD AS ROCKS. When I came back and asked for a refund (someone in the group I was presenting to nearly chipped a tooth on one) they actually denied my request!  I was told I could replace them but those would be a part of the old batch that was OLD & STALE.  So they agreed I could come back the following week and get a replacement order as I was presenting again then.  So coming back the following week and guess what happened?  The scones available were again several days old.  So I offered to accept another 1/2 batch of the bagel special w/a bagel breakfast sandwich just to try and get something for my money back.  They accepted BUT it certainly was a lot of hassle for something that should have never been sold as fresh or disclosed to be several days old at the initial point of purchase.  Note that the bagels and breakfast sandwich are very good which is the only reason I gave them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Their seasonal pumpkin creme cheese is pretty good, and I just found out they have discount bagels half price for a dozen from 2-3 PM.  After trying a few more sandwiches and drinks with no complaint I'll upgrade a star!  

P.S.  Their mocha coconut frappe is delicious!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place and the people who work there are very friendly. They happen to have good smoked salmon and great Bagels
Get your nosh on.  It will remind you of home."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time at this place. This eatery is way overpriced to only serve below average food and drinks. My husband and I ordered two regular bagels along with two iced blended coffees for $20.00. We thought this was a bit overpriced since they didn't even fill our cups halfway. Our drinks were half foam half ice. Not only did we get a small amount of coffee but the drinks were filled with ice pieces. I've been to many coffee shops and this is embarrassing, what we drank was not coffee. We were very displeased with the service and order we received. I'd advise customers to look beyond this overpriced shack and go elsewhere. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I really don't know where \"Back East\" these bagels are to be compared to, but they are certainly not New York style. They were small and somewhat deflated. To be honest, I think it is NYC tap water and air humidity that makes the bagels have the right texture and the right combination of chewiness and density. AZ air is too dry and the water, well, you know....

The honey-raisin-almond cream cheese was very good though."}
{"text":"They seem to have reduced the size of their Bagels reciently and they don't seem to be boiled before baking like they should be. Poor variety and they aren't very good at deciding how many of the popular variety they should bake daily. Staff is clueless and rude to customers."}
{"text":"Plenty of options for breakfast/lunch. Including salads, soups, smoothies, Italian sodas, and coffee, chi, juice, and soft drinks. Privately owned. Nice place for the whole family. Nice location. Nice staff. Reasonable prices. I'd definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"Bagels are pretty good but have been on the decline over the last 6 months.  Service is just a not up to par with others.  They cannot seem to get even the most mundane request accommodated (please don't toast or please cut in half).  Have gone at 11 and told they are out of plain bagels and they close soon.  They close at 2 pm which is not \"soon\" and how can you run out of plain bagels 3 hours before you close when you do your cooking on site and you have the word \"Bagel\" in your company name?  Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"This is Tempe's best kept secret!!! I lived in Boston and had the best bagels around and the bagels here beat the ones I used to get on the east coast! They are the best bagels hands down in Phoenix! Be sure to pair them with these amazing cream cheeses! Do yourself a favor and try something you have never had before!! You won't regret it! I have never had anything bad here!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here while out running a few errands myself.  Place is small, but seems to have a great selection of bagels, lunch items and some drinks like coffees and such. I came in here for a bagel and cream cheese, and it was tasty.  Not the fanciest place in the world, but far better then Einstiens."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst breakfast on the planet. Not sure where \"back east\" is. Show Low? Pine Top? Not the east coast, that's a certainty. Sandwiches are served on mini bagels; they are not close to full size but the prices sure are. Moreover, the bagels are tough. Bagels should be a bit firm on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. These are like eating leather throughout. Finally, and this is the biggest issue, they cook their eggs in the microwave. We ordered, literally took one bite and tossed the whole breakfast in the trash. It was disgusting. Honestly supermarket bagels are better. New York bagel enthusiasts be warned; go somewhere else, don't even think about it. A fake breakfast."}
{"text":"Sorry to only give this place 3 stars.  Since it is close to work I've been a fairly regular customer here recently.  The bagels are good as is the coffee with fair prices.  The chili habanero bagel is unique to them and the tomato basil is very tasty.  What I don't like about the place is the owner. If you are a young attractive women the middle aged owner will flirt with you and be very nice, however if you are a male or an older woman forget it, there is no recognition of your being there or appreciation for you being a regular customer, it is like you don't exist and he makes you feel like get out of the way dude so I can flirt with this cute young ASU sorority girl....it is kind of sickening."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service, and delicious bagels!  My favorite is the sesame bagel with lox cream cheese.  They also have great breakfast sandwiches as well, excellent prices!"}
{"text":"A very laid back locally-owned bagel shop at McClintock & Southern in Tempe. I really like their bagel breakfast sandwiches. I'm not much of a bagel aficionado in general, but people tell me these are as good as it gets. This would be pretty much the opposite of visiting an Einstein Bros."}
{"text":"I feel like these bagels were of similar quality to what I could buy in a grocery store. I also found it a little bizarre how they covered the bagel hole with cream cheese."}
{"text":"I almost never review on yelp so my review comes from a place of deep feelings. 

Needed a classis bagel this morning. Googled this place. I was skeptical at first but the negative reviews seemed to come from people who are super sensitive and I'm generally more tolerant of small things so I decided to come. 

Ordered an everything bagel toasted with vegetable cream cheese and a small coffee. Paid, got a cup for coffee, the coffee maker emptied after 3/4 of my cup was filled. I went to the counter and said \"I'm sorry but the french roast is empty\" Guy said we'll brew another batch. Sat down to eat the bagel it was soft consistency between a croissant and a roll. The vegetable cream cheese was a mild amount of cucumber in a buttery spread. Finished the bagel and still waiting on the coffee. I left so unsatisfied I'm writing this review from Einstein bagels 2 miles away. 

In their defense the veggie cream cheese is veggie lite and noone really didn't do anything wrong. My review is based on being a New Yorker coming to a place called BackEast Bagels. The decor is hipster chalkboard and feels like a west coast surfboard bagel place. The bagel and creamcheese are pretty inauthentic. I think if the place was called Big Kahuna Bagels and their feature item was sunset spread,  it would all make sense. 

Overall it's a nice place and if you want to say you had a bagel and cream cheese for breakfast so you can turn your nose up at your coworkers go for it. If you're expecting a legit authentic bagel and vegetable cream cheese that has carrots, scallions or the works. Skip it.

Oh and it's overpriced for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Great Bagels. One of the best in Phoenix. Very consistent.It gets busy some morning but they really move people fast."}
{"text":"Back East Bagels is OK. The best value is getting the bakers dozen. It's a good deal. Their tomato basil bagels are delicious. However, some of their bagels are kind of flimsy and lopsided. I look at them before I choose, so I don't get some thin bagels. They do not give you a stamp for a bagel and cream cheese on the sandwich card because apparently that's not a sandwich. Really?! A bagel and cream cheese costs about $3 after tax and then you don't give me stamp...That's a bit ridiculous. The bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwich is good thou. I think I'll just stick with the bakers dozen and make my own bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich at home."}
{"text":"This place has the best bagels I have ever had!  I don't know what it is, but they are just perfect, way better than Einstein IMO.  I even put a bunch in the freezer and they were still delicious when toasted.  I will definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for an early morning bagel."}
{"text":"So the bagel is very good, but the cappuccino is absolutely horrible. No joke, the worst I've ever had.  Ordered a triple shot and got a half gallon of milk. It was tepid. I can't even say it was warm. Sooo bad. Service was slow today as well. Really turned off by this experience. I would go back for just a bagel but wouldn't trust any coffee drink."}
{"text":"Popped in a for a bagel breakfast sandwich-- had it on the \"everything\" bagel aka the BEST bagel type ever.

It was good, filling.  Back East Bagels is a simple little coffee/breakfast/lunch spot.  Nothing over the top, there is no need for it.  Looks like they have a variety of sandwiches etc.

They had this little \"treat\" on the counter that was 2 homemade sugar cookies with homemade cream cheese between the two cookies.  It sounded sooo good.  I didn't buy on but I wanted to, just to have a taste of it.   I behaved.

I'm not in this part of town very often, maybe once or twice a year.  But I am glad I stopped in for my bagel sandwich this morning!"}
{"text":"Went here this morning with the BF on account of him being off of work for President's day and me not having school til this afternoon. We wanted a bagel for breakfast because we already went out to breakfast at real restaurants twice this weekend (Liberty Market and Centurion... both amazing). We were going to just go to Einsteins, but then I found this place on yelp where a lot of reviewers said these were much better than Einsteins. So I ordered the cheese and egg bagel sandwich on an everything bagel and the BF ordered a blueberry bagel with cream cheese and we both got coffee. The coffee was nothing special, DD has way better. Our food came out and looked kind of weird. The egg on the bagel was really yellow and fluffy, probably egg beaters. This sandwich had absolutely no taste. Now, an everything bagel should have flavor... cheddar cheese should have flavor. No flavor. The cheese was waxy and tasteless. The bagel was not chewy, it tasted like a slice of white bread... I don't even know how that is possible. No idea. The BF's bagel was not great, but he thought it was ok. I just cannot forgive a bagel that tastes like nothing... even after adding salt and pepper... I just couldn't save the food. I will never go back again and really I think this place is an insult to the east coast."}
{"text":"Try the lunch bagels!  The Northern exposure and Tempe turkey are excellent.  The chicken salad is really good too.  They aren't real expensive and the service is pretty good.  They also have outdoor seating.  They are new and as far as I can tell not a chain.  I recommend you try them.  Oh a dozen bagels are half priced after 2pm."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best bagel in Tempe, AZ... Have yet to find a better place even in PHX or Scottsdale. Great choice of bagels and even better cream cheese selection. 

You can't go wrong with an everything or poppy bagel with their garden veggie cream cheese. Those are my go to choices. 

Cheap prices, bagel sandwiches and paninis for lunch as well. If you're in Tempe make sure you check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Nice shop. Very friendly and hopefully. The begals are the best!!!! We will definitely making East Coast Begals our \" must go to\" shop."}
{"text":"So I called to place an order on Saturday and they said they don't do that on the weekend. Cool! So I sent someone to grab the food for me cause we're not so close but it was closer then Einstein bagels. He asked for a sautéed onion bagel cause he wasn't familiar with bagels but the person behind the counter didn't offer him an onion bagel and gave him a plain. So they basically mocked him as if he was stupid cause he didn't know bagels. If they would have takin the phone order we wouldn't have had this issue nor would my friend feel stupid."}
{"text":"The everything bagel with jalapeno cream cheese is incredible. My wife got toasted pumpernickel bagel with spinach chive cream cheese and she loved it. We tried two house roast of coffee and they were excellent. Much prefer this over the big franchises"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here at least once a month. Best bagels in the valley. The western is the best sandwich really on any kind of bagel. They have 2 different kinds of chai spiced or vanilla and they are both delicious. Small cafe with reasonable price and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Best coffee, delicious fresh bagels if you're looking to cure your east coast cravings."}
{"text":"Really cute little bagel and coffee spot.  Super props for their pumpernickle bagels.  OH YEA!  Bagels were actually pretty darn good too.  I did a chai - and they asked me what kind.  Good sign.  And oh yes, Soy was an option.  A free option.  

But as I was checking out - I saw their home made cookies.  Freaking freaking amazing cookies.  I held back.  

I won't next time."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I made the decision to leave the school I had worked at for three years. I was a bit sad, but mostly I was sad that I would no longer get to go to the \"Bagel Shop\" as many of us call it, every day. I loved the food here and went there maybe a bit too much but, hey when you find a place you love, you keep going. The staff is nice especially Mark and they treat everyone like a regular. I sometimes still make the 40+ minute drive to just go here."}
{"text":"OH WOW! I had lunch there again today (recent discovery). The Turkey Tempe + Avacado is litterally to die for. I love their bagels, music selections, staff, location and bagels (did i say that? YUMM).. I need to try the bagel bags for an office meeting i have a feeling they would be a hit. . I cant say enough nice things, its never packed, plenty of seating and selections. Only downside that I can find is they close at 2, so if your limited to a late lunch you may miss the awesomness :-) eat early..."}
{"text":"Still love their bagels and apparently I am not the only one since they won Phoenix New Times for Best Bagel (2011)."}
{"text":"The cheese and egg in my bagel were room temperature. The sandwich was bland tasting. I will possibly never return."}
{"text":"This place has consistently gone down hill every year since it changed ownership. I used to work in the same plaza for years and would frequent it due to convenience. 

I was at the mail store next door today and stopped by just to pick up a few bagels on my way home. On a Friday morning at 10:30am they were literally out of everything with the exception of about 15 bagels.  The place was dead, I'm assuming the lack of bagels was not due to being too busy. 

I asked for a toasted cinnamon raisin with honey almond cream cheese and a toasted tomato basil with veggie cream cheese. I live a mile away and went straight home to share them with my niece. They were terrible! One bagel looked like a shrunken version of the other. They were both undercooked and gummy. The veggie cream cheese had no veggies...  and neither of the bagels had been toasted like I had asked and waited for. They both lacked any flavor. 

I want to like this place and would be willing to give it another try if the customer service was there. It's just not. The three girls behind the counter that day treated myself and the gentlemen behind me as if we were inconveniencing them by ordering."}
{"text":"It was my first time and they completed my order quickly and it was delicious. The bagel was really good and the staff were super nice!"}
{"text":"We visited a friend in Mesa last week and Back East Bagels is her\"go to\" spot for bagels. Although there was some kind of mix up over whether or not we wanted our bagels toasted, the service was friendly, the coffee adequate and the bagels, lox, onion, tomatoes and smear were fresh, the and I didn't have to ask for capers. Not exactly Brooklyn, but then..."}
