{"text":"Convenient location easy to find inside the Excalibur. The burgers are great very juicy went twice while staying at the Luxor. The service was fast and the crew was friendly great prices not expensive."}
{"text":"Israel is the bestttttt. He helped me and my family on a really drunk night ~3AM and made our experience awesome. I went to Breakfast and Burgers a few more times because of how nice he was. I know I was drunk when I told his manager on duty how great he was - but we meant it! Thanks for the great service, the great alcoholic milkshakes, and for putting up with us!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was pretty standard fare and nothing really stood out. Liked the warm maple syrup which was a nice touch but then again pretty average tasting.. a good quick place to eat breakfast so don't expect fancy."}
{"text":"They have a very nice gig going on here. Friendly staff are on a roll. Taking care of customers minute by minute.  This is at the food court in the Second Floor of the Excalibur Hotel. The most basic platter with coffee is $$11.10 and you cannot say the five powerful words \"charge it to my room\" and make it happen. They do take credit cards, including AMEX.  You might still be hungry at the end of your meal. But, the tater tots & pre-scrambled eggs do the job for a lil while.  They have no salsa but you could ask for buffalo sauce to  kickstart the eggs. I don't think they have honey for the biscuits; so, I used syrup.   Seating could get limited in their newly remodeled dining area but it comes & goes.   Do the math: Whether to spend $11 and get only basic calories here -- or -- $30 for buffet/sit down full course breakfast? What do you feel like today?   In comparison, Johnny Rockets also serves platters and have a 50% off coupon in their paper placemats. Their platters have more meats, like bacon. And, you can charge it to your room there~  I'm glad I came here and supported this business. The friendly Staff -- who, yes, are very busy -- were the tie breaker for me~ breakfast was just OK and coffee was just right~ free refills ~"}
{"text":"I had an unbelievable experience at Breakfast & Burgers. First things first, I ordered the bacon cheese burger. Upon taking my first bite into the burger I realized that there was no patty... Everybody makes mistakes and I was quite fine at this point. However, when I took my burger to the counter, I was greeted by unprofessional employees who laughed amongst themselves as they thought it was hilarious. This really rubbed me the wrong way. I wasn't expected a free meal of any sort, but maybe just a nice apology."}
{"text":"Breakfast review -   It's ok. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Think slightly upscale McDonald's. Don't buy a breakfast sandwich, buy the breakfast platter that is one dollar more and comes with a biscuit, sausage, and eggs and tater tots. So, everything needed to make a sausage egg biscuit."}
{"text":"Definitely among the better burgers and fries I've had from a fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Kinda expensive for a burger joint located in a cod court ($30 for 2burgers). The food is pretty basic. To be honest, I'd rather wait in line for In-n-out. Bleh? drenched in mustard"}
{"text":"You would think that with a name like breakfast & burgers they would have burgers all the time. Nope you have to wait, but they have breakfast all the time they should change the name to breakfast and sometimes burgers. And the breakfast is super expensive eggs, biscuit, tits, coffee, sausage patty, pancakes 19.00. Should have walked less thank half a mile to MCDS atleast you know what your getting and paying."}
{"text":"Was hungry for breakfast and since I didn't want to pay $21 for a cheese omelette via room service. I decided to see what was in the food court. I wish someone would have stopped me from eating here. First off it took 20 minutes to make a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with a slice of processed cheese, fake egg patty, 1 cold strip of bacon and an under toasted English muffin. What in the entire hell! Nope, never again!"}
{"text":"I only went here for breakfast. Like the other reviewers commented, just higher priced copy of the McDonalds breakfast. Not as high of mark-up as many other places on the strip for their breakfast, but they don't do M Rewards points, other places in the food court do."}
{"text":"I come into town a lot for work and this is probably the 3rd time I came to this spot to eat,  past experiences weren't the best but it was way better than expected this time. I only ate here because it was open early morning & served breakfast. The young girl that took my order was very nice and helpful, she didn't rush me or seem bothered by me taking my time. Great service from her! And she was pretty that's a plus! I believe her name was Yessenia 2 Thumbs up for the great service! I will be back soon to order the same, sausage egg cheese muffin, she actually recommended it after I said no to the All American for it seemed like a little to much for me to eat. Great recommendation by the way!  I don't know what's different here guys but it's better than before! Food was out fairly quick and was warm from the plate to my mouth. I will be back soon in hopes to have the same young girl be my cashier. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"I mean hey it's fast food, terrible for you but when you want it you don't complain. I got an egg sausage muffin and tater tots. Both good. Could I make it at home just as well? You betcha. Did I enjoy paying $12-13 USD? No sir. It was also super annoying that they charged like $3.50 USD for a bottle of water when their pop fountain has a water tap. Tell people this!"}
{"text":"Waited literally 20+ minutes for food. Service was absolutely horrendous. Food was dry and terrible. There was no syrup for my pancakes, no creamer for my coffee, and none of the employees seemed to care about that or anything else for that matter. They also forgot party of my meal.  If I could rate 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"First time here but I think it's a good choice to have a good breakfast. Delicious and inexpensive. I like the egg and cheese biscuit and also the pancakes, it's fluffy and savory. The cashier, Lindsey really very prompt yet friendly."}
{"text":"Came here and got a breakfast biscuit with bacon and tater tots. Honestly taste like Mcd which is honestly pretty good. Came to the food court because running for the bootleg canyon zipline and got it to go. Tater tots were good and crispy. Plus it came with a nice plate full of them. Very good fuel to go for the whole day. Food was pretty fast. You get a buzzard to know when to get your food."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place between 1-2am in the Excalibur food court. After looking at the options the food court had to offer I came back here. By the time I made it back there was a line. About four people ahead of me. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a drink. Total with tax was about $15.00. Ouch! But that's kind of expected for a place in a Strip hotel/casino. Very fast service and the burger was delicious. Cooked perfectly, juicy, and flavorful. Fries were also great and I loved how they had both a ketchup and mustard dispenser. If I were to stay at the Excalibur again I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Staff was quick and friendly, but the food was terrible. McDonald's is better and is a short walk away. Greasy, no flavor, and stomach upsetting for both my husband and I."}
{"text":"Reviewer # 29   This place is in the food court of the Excalibur Hotel and Casino on the strip. It's okay... and just okay. Nothing special other than they have their own seating. They sell burgers and breakfast.   Everything on their menu comes in a combo. If you just want a burger you still pay the combo price -$1 only. Nothing special other than breakfast all day, but you can get that from Mcdonalds, or Jack in the Box. It wasn't too expensive compared to other places to eat.   The customer service was lacking, but not terrible. Overall, it was an \"A-OK\" experience."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger. Quarter pound patties, tastes almost just like an In-N-Out, but bigger. Good fires, too. Not sure about the breakfast items."}
{"text":"First Hour in Vegas and needed something to eat... Quick and Easy! I got the Cheddar Bacon Burger, DELICIOUS!!! I will be back for the double!"}
{"text":"Walked up 5 minutes before closing and was turned away. It takes 2 minutes to throw something in the fryer and maybe an extra minute to serve it.   Also the staff was pretty rude about turning me away. Wish I could review the food but I can only review the rude staff. Too bad this isn't McDonald's anymore"}
{"text":"This place serves the worst food! I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches and tots  I couldn't bite into my sandwich, it was hard and cold, my tots were even cold! Issa no for me dog! I will never eat here again and on top of that, it's expensive!"}
{"text":"There used to be a McDonald's at this location. They took it down and placed a ripoff McDonald's with prices doubled. Service is okay and food was out fairly quick. If you're looking for breakfast this is probably the best option considering most restaurants in this food court serve lunch. And. Be  prepared to pay a hefty amount for a breakfast sandwich and a coffee."}
{"text":"Biggest let down in Vegas, which is pretty bad considering I paid $26 for a big margarita near the pool. At least I got a decent buzz with that.    Overall, he flavor wasn't bad, just not impressed for a $18 meal. Spend a bit more and go to the buffet during lunchtime, and drink unlimited beer and/or wine.   Go anywhere else and you'll be better off."}
{"text":"Breakfast & Burgers served a mediocre breakfast, go elsewhere.  It's low quality institution type food."}
{"text":"McDonald's is better. They basically have the same things. Sausage egg and cheese on a muffin is tiny and it's $10. Never go there again!"}
{"text":"It was unfortunate that this was one of the only places open at 3 AM, which was a surprise on the Las Vegas Strip.  After coming back to our hotel from enjoying the Fremont Experience we were starving and wanted a quick burger. Sadly, everything on our way back was closed so as we walked through the Excalibur's food court we were stoked to see Breakfast & Burgers.  I was super disappointed with the crappy frozen tasting patty and the limp fries. The bun was soggy and the thin patty was gray and not appealing at all.  We were in Vegas for 5 nights, we ate here on the first one and didn't come anywhere near it again the entire time we were then no matter how hungry we were!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever. Tasted like something that you would get at the gas station. Food warmed up in the microwave,  but u were in a hurry and took it out early. I usually don't have a weak stomach,  but I had a stomach ache soon after eating. Never again."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to one of the other food places. Thought we would give it a try as it is a newer establishment in the food court.  Waited 21 mins for our food.  The pancakes were flavorless and the eggs were warm at best.  The tots were good.  Overall, many more options for places to grab a quick bite to eat.  Would not go back..."}
{"text":"The food was SO hot and delicious!!! We went back a second time because it was sooo good. The bigger and fries were great! For the cost and the food we could eat there all day!  A great option in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had hamburger, fries and drink here for lunch and also muffin and coffee in hurry!  Both are below average quality and much more expensive than anywhere else. The lunch cost me $17.00 and dim change (no cheese- that would cost more) and breakfast cost about $8.   You can have full buffet for lunch at the same hotel for $12.99 and full breakfast for $6.99"}
{"text":"Not good. Well, not bad. The burgers are McDonald's status. They came out fairly quickly. But are extremely small. Eight bucks for a tiny burger with just pickles on it? No thanks. They did compensate with a ton of fries. But still, not great."}
{"text":"We're staying at the Excalibur and swung by Breakfast and Burgers on our way from the pool to our room in the Royal tower. After walking around the small food court we decided on a cheeseburger for my husband and a breakfast sandwich for my son at B&B. I like the self-serve fountain drinks on the side- very convenient. The staff was nice and helpful.   Why I withheld 2 stars: We were a little disappointed that we weren't allowed to switch tater tots for fries in the combos we ordered. Also when we got back to our room we hungrily unwrapped our sandwiches to learn the meat patty was missing from both sandwiches! I also find it frustrating we don't get mlife points for purchases made at a mlife property's food court; I don't think this is their fault- however, i wanted to share the frustration all the same.   Excalibur, please bring back McDonald's! It's not great food, but it's, at least, familiar not-so-great food!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Nothing truly special about it but omg the flavor...cue Homer drool Would not object to eating here all weekend"}
{"text":"Took a long time to get our food. Not worth the price. Paid 30 dollars for 3 basic burgers and fries which drink is not included."}
{"text":"The portions are small for the price. The tater tots that come with the sandwich are too greasy for my taste. The oat meal is close to 6 dollars by itself. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Review from TripAdvisor Posting: ----------------------------------------------- We stopped by here for a quick breakfast before going to grab the RTC located in front of Excalibur.   Quite an average tasting egg muffin breakfast other than the fact that the pairings actually come with the muffin AND an order of tater tots as well. (I'm sure you can order just a muffin on it's own but it wasn't listed on the menu). Nonetheless, I've never had tater tots for breakfast before since I'm a loyal fan of the fast-food hashbrowns so it was a good way to change things up.   Overall, there's not too many breakfast options in the food court so if you need something quick and easy, this could be one of those go-tos."}
{"text":"mediocre food and really high prices, I know we're in Vegas but they really over did it, paid $9 for an order of fries and tater tots. The morning before I had oatmeal for $5. I would have not complained about their prices if the food was good."}
{"text":"What happened here. Last time it was great, it seems as if the changes went away, employees seemed angry today, not very friendly, food was very slow and the cashiers were not very happy today. I have been here since Friday on my hotel comp. Geez it is like you went backwards. Food took way too long this time, no one seem to care AGAIN...I guess what do you expect from FAST FOOD in a hotel. I am going to be at the luxor tomorrow I am sure they'll do better they are much better and have always been in the past, I love the Nathans and Bonnano's pizza when I stay there."}
{"text":"It's an alright place. Looks like the same all day breakfast as Johnny rockets downstairs near royal tower. The customer service was really bad though. We waited for 10mins to have someone give us a couple of cream or refill the milk. This is the only place that is open late night though. So if there's nowhere else to go to is the place"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Bad prices. The food sucks. The employees sucks. Plus one of the workers told me a quick reason why everyone unhappy it's the manger. That person said think about the price of the food and that's how the coworkers feel about being there."}
{"text":"Lacks flavor but it's not to bad, the bun is the real weak point and the spread is ok."}
