{"text":"It was my first time here and the food was amazing. The service was great. I ordered a 12 oz filet mignon and although pricey I have to say it was worth it. Would I come back again? No, because once is enough and I'd rather save money to try other things. But I would like to recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try some good steaks."}
{"text":"Funny enough went here recently and I'm not giving 5 star for steak I am giving it for the sea bass! absolutely delicious! very buttery and rich but great quality and with some Parmesan fries i was very happy."}
{"text":"my honey was looking for a good steak house in Vegas and this one came highly recommended. Everything from the bread, to the salad and the filet mignon was to die for. nicely aged and very tender. my beloved had the porterhouse. the service was magnificent.  lovely and romantic."}
{"text":"I have everything good to say about this Morton's.  Been to just about Atleast one Morton's in all the state's they have them because its my favorite steakhouse. Everything was on point from valet to the cook. Our server cant remember his name but very patient with my two friends that never been to Morton's.  I would definitely go to this location again."}
{"text":"Went to Mortons for my birthday, great place if you like to eat red meat which I dont. I had the Lamb Chops and Veggies. Food was excellent, price was a little on the high side. The whole food presentation, and service really didn't justify anything for me. Although it is really nice inside, and the valet service was a bonus."}
{"text":"We choose Morton's Steakhouse for our \"Celebratory Dinner\". 

We were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and my boys each had events to celebrate. 
The personalized menu were a very nice touch and was not expected. 

Ambiance:  Average - my chair was hit approx. 6 times during my dinner.  I kep on brining it in to avoid getting an elbow/foot/knee in the back of the chair. 
Noise was high. Atmosphere - not impressed. 

Service: Average: Our dishes were sitting in front of us for a long time before they were picked up.
Crossing over the table to add ground pepper on my salad. Really?  I get better service from my local Applebees. 
My son's steak was overcooked.  We were half way through our dinner and had to catch the other servers attention to speak with them about.

Food: 
Was amazing.  From the hors d'oeuvres to the desert.  It was mouth watering. 
I did order from the \"Savour the Summer\".  It was not offered to me, I did have to ask for it.  The servings are smaller than on the regular menu.  But for me, it was perfect. 

We will not be returing."}
{"text":"Morton's is okay, but I don't think I'll be coming back. The steaks are cooked well, ambiance is alright and service is decent... nothing quite stands out. 

I couldn't help but think of the better steaks I could be having elsewhere for only a little bit more. I think that is the challenge for Morton's - it's too average. Morton's steaks are aged for less than 30 days, so when you compare that against other steakhouses where you can choose from 30, 45, 60, 75+ day dry aged steaks, you can't help be lean towards the latter. (Especially since you're already paying a $$$$ price.) 

The bread was sizable and that's about it, the sides were forgettable and the appetizers looked better than they tasted. The desserts were good. 

A member of my party didn't like the way her steak was prepared, and the restaurant was nice enough to bring her another steak and take it off the bill. That was a kind gesture. 

You'll get good steaks here at Morton's, but will it blow your mind? Probably not."}
{"text":"Love it here! We've done celebratory dinners at the Morton's multiple times and we've never been disappointed. Great staff, good wine list, amazing food! Definitely worth a stop in."}
{"text":"The meat melts in your mouth. Nuff said FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"I was there for dinner with a friend last week.  Our server John was very nice and professional.  Foods were great! We both had the filet mignon medium rare, perfect! $40 comes with a salad, 6oz filet mignon, a side, and a dessert!  It was a great deal!!  Love it"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Morton's couple months ago. We just came back from our anniversary trip. It was late at night, we were tired and starving after a long flight. We decided to top our anniversary with a visit to Morton's.

We both got steaks (I took the fillet mignon). They were really, really good. The sides were so-so. We skipped desert and got coffee instead.

The ambiance was very relaxing, subdued and quite intimate. It helped there were only 3 other tables being served that late at night. I was very pleased with the service. Attentive, knowledgeable and witty.

As expected the tab was pricey, around $100 (dinner for 2, two rounds of drinks and coffee) but was worth it as an anniversary gift. I wouldn't go there for a regular dinner."}
{"text":"Lack of ambiance but we got there at 7:45 pm so it's hard to tell..the food was a 4 stars but the service was a five !! The waitress was very attentive and professional. The crab cakes were the best. We will go back."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at this Morton's location and unfortunately I can't say it was too much better than my most recent Morton's experience in New York. 
Aside from the bread and desserts, everything was just okay. If this were Outback or another lower-end steakhouse it would be passable, but for a steakhouse of this caliber and price point I was definitely disappointed. 
At Morton's in new york a few months ago my french onion soup arrived after my steak so I never ended up tasting it. I was sooo looking forward to finally having the fench onion tonight and was severely disappointed. Instead of the rich, beefy broth of a great french onion soup I tasted a heavy rosemary flavor. It completely overpowered the soup to the point that I didn't even eat much of it which says a lot (take a look at some of my other reviews, I LOVE  a good french onion soup!). The salads we ordered (caesar and tomato/onion) were okay, but again nothing special. 

I'd be able to overlook a sub-par french onion soup at a steakhouse if the main attraction-the steak- is exceptional. For four people we ordered the double cut bone-in ribeye and a double cut filet. The ribeye was MUCH smaller than the one shown to us on the presentation menu (and that's accounting for shrinkage during cooking even though we order our steaks rare). The worst part of the meal was when we cut into the filet \"their leanest, most tender cut\" as decribed by the waiter, only to find large areas of fat and cartilage. It took us a few minutes and asking another server to send over our waiter before the issue could be rectified. As someone who has eaten in MANY steakhouses I found the service to be lacking, just as it had been in new york.
For dessert we ordered the key lime pie, cheesecake and creme brulee. The key lime pie and cheesecake were fantastic, but the creme brulee was a little to runny and the sugar crust a little too burnt. 
I think it will be quite a few years before I give Morton's another shot...there are way too many great steakhouses, both local and chains, to waste money on subpar steaks and service."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place for a good dinner....but we will NEVER go back. The evening manager is useless. We were having a lovely evening,  went to see Steven Tyler,  everything was great, until we decided to go to this place. We called to see if it was too late for dinner,  manager said no, come on over ..we get there and I hear the cook say \"We'll, I guess we are staying late\"...so I order a salad out of guilt,  which came on a dirty plate and my fiance veal chop was completely raw. Our waiter was no where to be seen, so I got up and was talking the raw veal back to the kitchen,  the waiter popped up and agreed...the meat was raw. He takes it to the kitchen...the \"cook\" chars the meat and ruined the veal completely...our dinner there was so bad, the manager didn't charge us for anything.  My advice...don't go there! Go to Smith & Wollensky or Joes at Caesars. Mortons has gone down hill big time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Stop in every time we are in Vegas. Just had a medium rib-eye and had to stop for a moment of silence after the first bite. Delectable! Jesse was our server and made a a fabulous meal into a fun meal, too."}
{"text":"I had never been to Morton's before.  Went here for a wedding reception.  The restaurant is very nice and their wine fridge is amazing!  The reception had a pre-set entree/menu and everything was OK.  I didn't have steak..I preferred the salmon and it was good.  Their shrimp and crab cakes were very good also (according to my husband, I cannot eat shellfish).  Their house merlot was excellent according to everyone at our table..very smooth.  The wedding cake was an amaretto cake and it was AMAZING!  Their staff was quick and attentive.  One of the big reasons why I am giving this place 4 stars is because of their staff.  Our rental car battery went dead outside the restaurant and at 9:30pm one of the valets went inside and out came an employee who said he would give us a jump!  Wow...never ever expected that...above and beyond..our group was very appreciative and grateful!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  You can't ever go wrong here when you want a good steak.  The Mac & cheese is also a must.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Was seated next to the front door, every time it opened a cold breeze would enter the restaurant . Salad was ok but very small, I ordered the filet , cooked medium, was ok but on the dry side, could have used some A-1. Restaurant is way over priced, I have had better steaks on my backyard grill. Not worth the money"}

{"text":"From the time you walk in the door to the time you leave it's always a special occasion!   Thanks for making our time special.  To waiter Waldo hope to see you again very soon."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally chose Mortons as there are plenty of great restaurants in Vegas but I received a $250 gift card from a business associate. This is my second trip to Morton's in 2 years. The other was in king of Prussia PA. If nothing else this chain is consistent. Overpriced and underwhelming. I had the wedge with blue cheese and the petite fillet with Alaskan king crab legs. The steak was prepared as ordered (medium) and was a 5 on a scale of 1-10. The crab was the same. For dessert I chose the crem brûlée pie and fresh rasberries. Both of these were fresh and enjoyable. When the check arrived I was glad I had a gift card although it didn't cover the $270 bill for two. Frankly, for the money there are dozens of superior restaurants in Vegas. Save your money."}
{"text":"My wife and I love it here. We've been going to a Morton's steakhouse since we've been married in one place or another. This one in particular stands up to the excellent quality of food we've come to expect from Mortons. The atmosphere is usually a bit noisy, but not too bad, and the staff are always professional, informative about their cuisine and quick to attend to our wants/needs."}
{"text":"Allow me to preface this by saying I don't like giving bad reviews.  But since Morton's is a chain restaurant, I'm sure my opinion won't force them to close up shop.  Its more of a call to arms than anything.

Our recent meal at Morton's, with their elevated price points and long-standing tradition, was disappointing, plain and simple.  I would be inclined to blame it on Restaurant Week, but my wife ordered off of the normal menu.

The beef was substandard, tasting more like a sirloin from Chili's than the supposed high-quality cuts Morton's claims to shill.  When I bit into my side order of broccoli, each floret was half-warm and half-cold.  The only thing keeping my rating at 3 stars and not lower was the pleasant service we received.

When you spend the amount of money that equals half of a normal shopping trip for one meal, you expect much more than we received on this visit.  Simply put, a horrible value.  Extremely disappointed in your food, Morton's.  Your move."}
{"text":"we planned a special Christmas Eve dinner here this year. We recently moved to Charlotte and have enjoyed Morton's in Chicago and NY.  This was a horrible dinner! It started good. Our waitress was wonderful! We reserved a 6lb lobster for my husband and daughter (tradition). Our meal took quite a long time to be prepared, when we received it my filet was cold, covered in spices and overcooked. My son's bone-in ribeye was small (typically thick and very large), cold and overcooked. Vegetables and baked potatoes were cold. The worst was the lobster. It looked wonderful, however it was not cracked (typically it is cracked to ease your enjoyment). When asked to have it cracked (again this is usually done tableside), they took it away and when they finally returned there was a small bread plate of meat. We asked where the rest of the lobster was.  When the manager finally came by he was rude and couldn't understand why we were upset. He upset our Christmas Eve dinner experience so much that my son and I decided not to even mention the steaks...Suffice it to say we will never return to this Morton's! Morton's is an expensive restaurant that has to live up to it's expectations for a delicious meal and positive experience.  They failed. The Palm does it right."}
{"text":"I have to say that my experience at this restaurant was absolutely amazing!  My husband and I went there to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. When I called to make our dinner reservations, the lady on the phone asked if this was a special occasion. I told her it was our wedding anniversary. When we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess was very welcoming and friendly. When he escorted us to the table, he actually pulled out the table so we didn't have to slide into the booth. This had never been done for us at a restaurant before.  When he handed us the paper menus, I noticed right away that typed at the top of the menu was a \"Happy 1st Anniversary Mr. and Mrs. Lara\"  When I saw this, I thought this was so cute and thoughtful for them to acknowledge our anniversary.  The hostess also came by and took our picture and then put it in a nice Morton's paper frame.  Our waiter, Kenneth, was also very very nice. He was so attentive to our needs and very friendly and personable. He explained the menu very well and was able to answer all the questions we had.  Our water and drinks were always refilled. We didn't have to ask for anything. Our waiter always checked on us to see if we needed anything. I got the Cajun Ribeye steak and it was the best steak I have ever had. I definitely recommend it to everyone! It was so juicy and tender and melted in your mouth. We also got the spinach and mushrooms and the sour cream mashed potatoes as sides which were also to die for. After the meal, we got to choose the flavor of our souflee dessert. It was very light and so delicious. This dinner was a little pricey, but worth it every penny for special occasions. I loved this restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse. There are many great steakhouses out there but Morton's is always consistent.  The ribeye is my favorite cut there.  They make them perfect.  The sides are good but the steaks are so big you may not have much room for them.  I also recommend either their French onion soup or their tomato salad as an appetizer.  Definitely can't leave without having their molten chocolate cake for dessert.  The drinks for the bar are good as well.  You can end up spending a small fortune here though."}
{"text":"I've been a Morton's fan for years. Over time one particular server, Tara Linker, has become our absolute favorite and requested server. She has a great personality and an uncanny ability to remember what you like to order and how you like it prepared. Her serving assistants are nice too. 

Kevin the general manager is very personable and runs a well organized ship without being obvious. If you need to plan a party get in touch with Lisa Heim, events planner. She will help you plan an event to remember!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, (Chicago bone in is my favorite) and the outstanding mixologists at the bar are the best in Las Vegas! They mix the perfect drink, and every recommendation whether food or drink is exactly what I had in mind at the time. I am extremely particular with my service and I ALWAYS have a rewarding experience."}
{"text":"Love this steakhouse. Price is a little high, but I think the quality justify's it.

The steak was cooked exactly as I ask for it. The waiters were curtious and helpful. Dining decor was very classy and clean. It was definitely a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Never again will I ever come here!! My husband and I both order steaks and a side of macaroni and cheese. For  the price of the steak I would think that I would be getting one of the best steaks of my life but it was below average. I can say the macaroni was very tasty.  But for these prices  I would have expected a better meal. Plus we were the only ones in the restaurant. Mhmmmm....... I wonder why."}
{"text":"This evening we dined for my husband's birthday.  Even though I noted it in our reservation, no one asked if we were celebrating anything this evening.  Not a big deal though.   Next, the waiter was courteous, and did a decent job.  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere, as well, but we will not be returning in the future.  We got the Shrimp Alexander appetizer, which we both loved, but that was the only thing we really liked.   As far as dinner goes, my shrimp capellini was just ok.  My husband got the veal chop and did not like it.  He ordered it well-done but it was rare a few bites in.  He ended up leaving a lot of the expensive dinner on the plate.  Further, the waiter referred to the veal chop as a pork chop two times, which made my husband feel uneasy throughout the night, and put a psychological damper on his meal because he cannot eat pork.  An innocent slip on the waiter's part, I'm sure, but it was just the icing on the proverbial cake of a lackluster, but super pricey dinner.   We also asked for lemons for his salad, but the lemons were a bit dehydrated.  The sour cream mashed potatoes were okay by me, but my husband didn't like them at all.  Overall, we give it a thumbs-down."}
{"text":"I hadn't been in Morton's in quite a while. Made a spur of the moment reservation and was thoroughly pleased with the great booth where we were seated.  This was my granddaughter's first \"steakhouse\" experience and she was not disappointed.  The service was fantastic, the wait staff is a group of friendly, extremely professional \" old school\" super stars.  My party of three ordered the ribeye, filet and the mixed grill seafood platter.  We liked the practice of the \"split\" items like the salads and other items because of their size and the cost consideration.  Steaks were exactly as ordered and the seafood perfectly prepared. Of course we took to-go boxes for the left overs.  Also enjoyed the chocolate lava cake dessert which is ordered half way through our dinner which is prepared in time for service after our dinner. I also liked the on-line easy reservation arrangement.  All in all, it was a perfect evening for all, we will be back again.

{"text":"Great steakhouse... Amazing atmosphere, great food and great service. The fillet mignon was juicy and tender with large sides to share. Only, it was a little cold but I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Morton's, but I have to wonder if the recent purchase by Landry's (which are atrocious) has sent the quality over the cliff. Way too garlic-y appetizers followed by poor cuts of meat inexpertly cooked dry. As a bonus, a big pile of gooey sediment in my $13 glass of wine.

I wouldn't be so harsh on them if they weren't trying to pass this off as \"fine dining\" with a commensurate price. Nothing comped, nor anything offered in compensation - which begs the question, why bother asking if everything was good if you can't do anything about it if it isn't?"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Morton's on our recent trip to Vegas.  Being that we were on vacation, we were looking foward to going to a nice, upscale restaurant for a really good meal.  The restaurant was close to where we were staying at the Hard Rock, and the neighborhood seemed safe, so we walked.  

The staff was friendly.  The place was not busy, but we sat for awhile after being seated before the waiter brought a menu, and then, it was only a beer and wine menu.  We ordered cocktails.  We don't mind paying for good food and good service, so I expected it to be a bit pricey, but $8.00 for a lite beer was a bit much.  When the waiter poured the beer from the bottle into the glass, it didn't all fit, so he was going to take the last bit away with the bottle.  At that price, we made sure we got it all!   After the drinks came, we had to sit and wait awhile longer before we got food menus.

Next, we ordered salads.  Neither of us eat onions, so our choice was limited, since we were told the salads were premaid with onions.  We ordered the bacon spinach salads because the menu description looked like something we would like, but to our distaste, they came with mushrooms throughout, which we also do not eat, and the bacon we almost undetectable.  We sent them back and did without.  Eventually, the waiter brought us a small loaf of \"onion bread\" that we nibbled on, since we were starving by this time, and the restaurant didn't have another kind of bread to substitute.  

Next we ordered our entree's.  My wife ordered the fillet and I got the ribeye.  The $45 fillet was fatty and tough, and the ribeye was worse.  The portion size also seemed smaller than listed on the menu.  There wasn't much choice for side dishes, so we got mashed potatoes \"to share\".  We would've also ordered a vegetable side, but we expected to have the $15 spinach salads that we ended up sending back.  The \"share\" portion of potatoes turned out to be enough for just one person.

With the way the evening was going, we decided to forego dessert.  $200 and 3 hours later, we left Mortorn's dissappointed and still hungry.  I would've been more satisfied with a footlong sub from Subway!  I wouldn't gamble on Morton's in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Approximately a year and a half ago I went in to check out their happy hour. It did not go well. I ordered the mini-cheese burgers medium rare to go with my Cadillac Margarita. The drink was good as was the service form the bartender, a pleasant woman that said she had been there for years.

 When the order finally arrived it was past well done. I pointed it out to the bartender who offered to redo the order, but as it took so long to arrive the first time, I declined her offer. I slept on it and decided to e-mail the general manager who expressed concern and offered a $25.00 \"gift\" card to redeem their reputation.

 On Monday, 02/10/14, I decided to check them out again by ordering exactly the same thing. The bartender was the same and she was once again pleasant. When the food finally arrived I wondered if it was the same food I'd ordered a year and a half ago. I cut one of the burgers, which more closely resembled a small meat ball,  in half. It was beyond well done. I asked for and spoke with the manager who offered once again to redo the order. I declined his offer as the time invested coupled with the repeat (lack of) performance soured me on the restaurant.

 I have had good and even great experiences at the San Diego location.

Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Went with our company for a Christmas dinner. 3 of 6 of our steaks came out totally wrong. For $49 for a 6 oz steak it shouldn't take THREE tries to get it right. I ordered well well well done and got medium, so they took it back and brought me another steak 20 mins later that was even pinker than the last one! At that point everyone else was already on dessert so I said just forget it and take it off the bill bc i was full from the sides by that point and didn't feel like dealing with it any further. The manager took that steak and had them make it well done which came back as burned and completely charred- was pretty rude actually. Chili's can cook a better steak than them. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I would have to say this was the most overpriced restaurant I've ever been to. I had a unique experience to say the least but won't go into too much detail as the managers eventually made it right. I will say that I have been there twice and neither time did I enjoy my $60 steak. It was extremely bland and overcooked. My girlfriend ordered the scallops the first time which were average at best. The second time she ordered the surf and turf special which was a small lobster tail and small fillet. It was the best thing we've tried there. The ahi tuna tower appetizer was very good as well. Those are the only two good things I have to say about Morton's. Like most nice restaurants, everything is a la carte. Our waitress raved about their \"twice baked\" au gratin potatoes and the lyonnaise potatoes as well. Both were below average to say the least. Our service was AWFUL as our waitress was 100% the most ignorant server I have ever had. I will never go back to Morton's nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We have only been here for happy hour. The food is pretty good, and the prices are fantastic! You can definitely get some good quality food here for a great price. They also do a reverse happy hour later in the night, and that's great too! The service is also very good and quick."}
{"text":"It's not going to be cheap, but if you're looking for a great meal, it will be worth it! I had the NY strip, and we tried both the hot and cold seafood platter appetizers (I went with a large group). The steak was juicy and cooked perfectly. The seafood was ah-mazing - oysters, lobster, shrimp, everything good on one plate - served with various sauces for dipping. For dessert, we had a birthday at the table and ordered chocolate and vanilla cakes to share with all - they were to die for, and I don't even really like cake! Everything they do at Morton's, they do well. I would recommend this steakhouse any day!"}
{"text":"Went there with 3 others during \"restaurant week\".  Usual parking problems with the valet parking hogging the lot.   Place was clean, service was good.  The $40 special plus some lobster was mediocre at best.   I expected a great steak from a steak house.   The chocolate souffle was unrecognizable, but the creme brule was tasty.  The noise level was unbearable.   Despite my good hearing, I could hardly hear two of the other three people at our table.  I expected much more at an expensive restaurant and won't be returning.
There are far too many better restaurants at lower prices than Morten's."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The steaks, the sides, the service, and the atmosphere all add up to a great experience. I can understand the high prices being a turn-off to many people that say a good steak can be found at much cheaper prices, but for me, this place is just a great experience in general. I find that it's worth the occasional splurge, and I would go just for the potato pancake alone"}
{"text":"Got the prime rib and new york strip, not that great for the price.  I'd rather drop $250 at other local steakhouses downtown TO.  Service was typical for a place like this pretty good.  But the steak was very dry for medium rare with the little too burnt on the sides.  Wouldn't go back to this Mortons again.  Ruth's is better than this location."}
{"text":"Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Best special occasion or business dinner restaurant in Scottsdale. This place is the only reason I'd ever want more birthdays. As I was writing this 5 star review, my screen somehow changed TWICE to only a 3 star review, hmmmm. Excellent food, service, wine list."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here before and thought we would try it again this past weekend. It was also restaurant  week so I'm not sure if this is the reason for the terrible experience. 
Let's start with the service- our waitress was pretty terrible. When we mentioned we were interested in the specials for restaurant week it was like a switch was turned off. She was no longer interested in good service. After that the only time we saw her was when we flagged her down ( for additional drinks butter etc).

Our first course took about 45 minutes to arrive. For a salad. 
I ordered grilled chicken and my husband the filet. My chicken came out and when I bit into it I realized the chicken was still raw. Not like slight pink but not cooked at all. Our waitress still was not coming to our table so I had to flag down a waiter to get her. He refused and instead asked what I needed. I told him my chicken was ( very obviously) raw.
Our waitress came over about ten minutes later to see how we were, realized I didn't have my plate and abruptly walked away. 
My husband refused to eat until I got my food which then made his meal cold. 
I received my chicken with an apology from the waitress. What I assume was the manger came over and apologized briefly but it was just an oh sorry for serving you raw chicken. 
I can tell you after the service , meal and customer service we will NOT be back which is a shame as we both work very close to Mortons. 

If you are looking for a nice steak in Pittsburgh try capital grille or Ruth Chris ."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! We were in town for weekend and looked up the reviews in yelp for a nearby steakhouse. Service was top notch, wine list extensive and above all an excellent meal. Would definitely recommend it for a special occasion and great meal out."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our 6th anniversary at Morton's Las Vegas. We both enjoyed the crab cake appetizer. Coming from a non-seafood lover (me) that is saying a lot. I ordered the filet with a bourbon sauce - The sauce is the BOSS! We both shared the carrot cake for dessert. It was good as well, but a little too sweet for me. The service was good. I am sure we will be visiting Morton's again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Mortons in nearly a decade.  During that time, I've been to numerous steak restaurants throughout Las Vegas and elsewhere.  At even the best steakhouses, I would always compare them to my memorable experience at Mortons -- and while many of them were great, none were as good as Mortons.  Well, after saying for so many years that other places were not as good as Mortons (and some recent bad experiences at other steak restaurants in Vegas -- see my other Yelp reviews), I decided to go back to see if Mortons was still as good as I remembered.   Long story short - Mortons did not disappoint.  I will not wait another decade before going back  Mortons definitely sets a standard by which all other restaurants should strive to reach in terms of both customer service and food quality.

It was a birthday celebration.  Mortons knew in advance and provided personalized menus with name and date at the top.  Nice touch.  Lady came by during the dinner and offered to take a picture at no charge.  Later provided it in a personalized Morton's paper frame (we tipped $5).  Another nice touch -- and better deal than what I remember a long time ago with the Cashman photogs patronizing these places.

Spouse enjoyed the escargot appetizer (the best she has encountered -- good presentation, bread underneath was a great touch).  She ordered the seafood mix grill -- crab cakes, grilled shrimp, shrimp Alexander.  She thought the shrimp Alexander was overcooked and too salty, but I tried it and liked it.  The service and overall experience made up for any minor flaws in that dish.    

I passed on the appetizer even though I remember the shrimp cocktail being very good (I can't eat as much as I could a decade ago).  I'm at a steak house, so I'm here to eat steak.  I ordered NY strip, medium well.   Order of the truffle fries for the table.  I don't know what Morton's secret is, but they know how to cook a steak perfectly so that it is exactly how I want it (medium well, just a little pink) and yet the steak is so warm and juicy that you don't even need to use any steak sauce to eat it (which is one way I judge a steak -- if I can enjoy it without any steak sauce).  The steak was simply amazing -- just as good as Mortons.  

Finally, for dessert, ordered the chocolate lava cake.  Came out on decorated plate as you would expect when you have a special occasion dinner at such a fine dining establishment.  And the dessert was complimentary (they didn't bring out some cheap dessert they give for free -- we ordered the dessert we wanted and they gave it to us complimentary).   Sadly, even though this is the way all high end steak houses should be, more and more you are seeing these places not go to such extra lengths.  Not at Mortons.  They still know what it means to be a high end steakhouse and how to provide their customers with a fine dining experiences.  

If you've ever been afraid of going to Mortons because it's a chain, let me assuage those concerns.  I've been to numerous other steak restaurants that are supposedly the best -- and none of them match Mortons.  Many of them come close, but Mortons remains the best in my book.  I will not wait another decade before going back."}
{"text":"I wish that zero starts was an option ; however, one star is as low as yelp allows me to rate. Therefore, Mortons gets one star! The business is extremely homophobic- so be cognizant of that. I was with my husband and we were celebrating a rather joyous anniversary dinner. The waiter walked by and saw me sitting on the same side of the table as my husband. He approached and said \"sir, you can sit opposite your friend if you'd like\". I informed him that he is my husband, not a friend.  Further, I was quite comfortable in my seat. He seemed bothered by that answer. About 5 minutes later he walked over and ask me \" Sir, would you and your friend mine not holding hands. It is offensive to some people- we don't all agree with your lifestyle choice\". I asked him to stop calling my husband my friend, and I told him I have every right to hold his hand. He was extremely agitated at this point. After dinner I gave my husband a quick kiss on the cheek as I gave him the watch I bought for his anniversary gift. The waiter walked up and set the check on the table and said \" you and your friend can't kiss in here. It's not appropriate\". 

Why does he keep calling him my friend? 
I corrected him 2 separate times. 
A few other couples were holding hands and no one approached them. I saw several kisses that were far more involved then my simple peck on the cheek - no one asked them to stop. 

This place seriously needs to learn to respect it's customers. My husband and I are both military and fight for this country in uniform. The thought that we have to deal with this type of Intolerance and disrespect is ridiculous. I will not return until adjustments are made."}
{"text":"Opening Remarks:
-Currently #90 on Joanne Kates Top 100 Restaurants for 2013
-Renowned for its classic steakhouse menu and it's accompanying top-notch service
-Morton's is a chain restaurant with over 69 restaurants stemming from Arnie Morton and Klaus Fritsch's 1978 opening in Chicago.

Ambiance:
-Upon entry, the first room you see is the bustling packed bar. With a few rich wood high tops, barstools, and a mirrored back wall emphasizing their premium selection of liquor, the space feels like an up-scale French brasserie. 
-Similarly, the main dining room is grand, yet inviting.  The tables are draped in white linens (which, after a few drinks we accidently mucked up with meat drippings), and the chairs and banquettes are cushiony and cozy.  The lighting is dim and supplemented by candles, making the service counter from the kitchen spill light on the entire room.
-Up the carpeted staircase I noticed there are also few private dining rooms- a great downtown spot for a special group occasion.
-I saw a good mix of demographic in the room. Of course there were mainly older couples and groups and middle-aged business folk, but I did spot a few younger 30-somethings out to celebrate, and even some families in the mix. 
-Despite the familiar old-school steakhouse vibe and the slightly 50+ weighted demographic, there was an unmistakable element of youth. It wasn't stuffy or pretentious in there (as one might find in, lets say, a Palm Beach establishment). It was buzzing, exciting and loud. I don't think there was any music playing (and if there was, I couldn't hear it) but rather, the accumulation of conversations filled the air.  It wasn't, like, Westend hipster loud, thankfully, because there wasn't any crazy fast-paced beats going on under the chatter so I found it totally palatable.

Service:
-Upon entry, we were greeted by the friendly hostess who took our jackets and umbrellas. Next we were introduced to the maitre'd who took us to our table in the main dining room.  
-The rest of the evening continued with refinement and professionalism, but again, felt more youthful and personable than the expected \"steakhouse snobbery\". Our server was a bubbly 20-30 year old woman with extensive knowledge of the menu and impeccable timing on every element of the night. She made excellent recommendations on food and wine, ensured we understood the different flavour profiles of each cut of steak, checked up on how we enjoyed each course, and replenished water, side dishes and cutlery frequently.  
-The meal moved at a very comfortable pace- with four courses getting us in and out in approximately 1  1/2 hours. I was particularly grateful that she asked me how I would like to pace the meal once I put in my order- would I like the salad with the appetizer or after? As a food blogger, there is nothing I hate more than having all the dishes I order come at once, so I appreciated her checking with me.
-I also liked that she took the time to see that we were \"okay\" with having bacon in our potatoes since the menu doesn't explicitly list them as an ingredient. Now, obviously I'm down with the bacon, but I can see how not asking could be a problem for some patrons, so to me, this was a real mark of good training.

Drinks:
-Those who do like their drinks hard will be impressed by their selection of small batch bourbon, and rye whiskey, imported cordials, sherrys, dessert wines and boozy coffees.
-There are about a dozen International beers by the bottle ($8.25) including favourites like Coors Light, Sam Adams, Stella and Guiness.
-It wouldn't be a steakhouse without some solid wine offerings in the house. There are around 2 dozen International wines available by the glass (ranging from about $11-21), and a couple hundred available by bottle (including some half bottles and magnums).
-My sister, big on the bold whites, opted for the 2011 Butterfield Station Chardonnay ($14.25) and then the 2011 Kenwood Yulupa Chardonnay ($17.25). The former was a touch more on the sweet side, while the latter was much more dry and her style.
-Morton's signature cocktail is the Morton Mortinis, which comes garnished with Morton's hand-stuffed blue cheese olives.  They also offer a handful of classic cocktails (Cosmo, Manhattan, Bloody Mary, Margaritas) and 5 \"Heavenly\" Martinis with 200 calories or less. 

Food:
-The food menu is old school classic steakhouse- divided into Appetizers, Soups/Salads, Prime Steaks/ Chops, Signature Dishes/Poultry/Seafood, Mixed Grills (Combination Plates), Sides, and Desserts.
 -Morton's only uses USDA Prime-Aged Beef (the highest quality grade designation of the USDA for tenderness, juiciness and flavour).
-They offer a full Dinner, Lunch, and Bar Bite menu as well as menus for those who are gluten or soy intolerant.
-Everything is served a la carte so you can build your meal as you choose...."}
{"text":"My fiance and I wanted a nice restaurant venue -- that WASN'T in a casino--for our intimate 50 guest wedding so that we wouldn't have to bother with too many vendors and details and decorating. After looking at plenty of options (and believe me, Vegas has just too many), we wandered into Morton's and wandered out completely sure that Morton's was it. Their event coordinator was on the ball with every question we asked them, from children's menus, to available technological facilities (wireless or wired mic, ipod connection, and projection screen in 2 of their banquet rooms), to how much freedom we have to decorate, what's the party minimum (i believe 20-25 people), menus with price per person, what's included, everything. They even gave us dates that we could visit the facility before other wedding events so that we could see how it is set up. A week later the coordinator called us for some follow up, and we signed a contract with them soon thereafter.

We never regretted it. The entire time they kept good communication with us, sometimes asking us about details that we hadn't thought about. The event coordinators were professional, on the ball, warm, friendly, and personal. They were responsive to even the smallest details that we asked them about, including getting the names and numbers of all our other vendors (cake and florist) just in case things didn't arrive while we were at the ceremony. They also set up our decorations the morning of, just as we asked them to. We couldn't have asked for more. 

In keeping with Morton's tradition, the food WAS DELICIOUS, the atmosphere was classy, and the waitstaff very skilled and professional, and they were honest: we paid more than we actually used (the guests didn't drink as much alcohol as we thought they would) and they gave us a check for amount we overpaid the same day. This is a refreshing breath after so many of the wedding horror stories I hear where venues take newlyweds for as much as they can.

Our wedding reception was absolutely lovely. I highly recommend Morton's to anyone looking for a great intimate wedding venue-- or even a nice date night."}
{"text":"I've been to steakhouses from NY to LA and from Vegas to Boston and back again and this restaurant gets a top ten ranking. In general the crowd is a bunch of pretentious pricks, which I'm not crazy about, but the food here is impeccable! It has an awesome wine list and great service. Consistency of preparation with fresh ingredients are what has made Morton's one of my favorite places in The Valley. The food there was prepared exactly as I had ordered it, and the wait staff is most accommodating. The bar scene is your average young, scantily-clad women with the older men wearing jeans and trying to look relevant. All in all Morton's is a safe bet."}
{"text":"The ceaser salad was awful, half the lettuce was bad and warm. Most of the lettuce had no dressing at all, just plain lettuce while the rest had so little it was hard to eat. When the steaks came we had a New York which was excellent and I had a 6oz filet which was great as well. Although we dont worry about $, we found that this restaurant was to pricey for the quality. I've had way better for way less. It's also extremely loud. If you want a peaceful great meal I do not recommend Mortons."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Morton's for our anniversary. They impressed us with the small touches, like printing \"happy 5th anniversary\" on our menus, taking our picture, printing and (cardboard) framing it with the date on it and giving it to us for free, and the friendliness and service was excellent. And of course the food was top notch. Best Caesar salad I've ever had, and though it may not have been my favorite filet mingon, it was perfectly cooked and was still great. The shrimp were monstrous and the stuffing made them even better. We tend to go to pricey, upscale spots on the strip when we celebrate occasions, and the food at Morton's not only compared to our favorite places, but our bill was about 75% of what we would have expected it to be for the quality we received. They were out of the dessert wine we chose, and the alternative wine was given to us for free. I highly recommend Morton's for people who would like an equivalent 5 star Vegas strip experience but spend less money."}
{"text":"Great service an delicious food! Make sure to ask for John."}
{"text":"Morton's is still one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  My wife and I go to Morton's 2-3 times a year and we've had a great experience every time.  We went recently for our anniversary and Morton's presented us with a custom menu for the occasion.  They also took our picture and presented it to us in a Morton's picture holder.  The service here is simply amazing and we always feel welcome.

But the real reason to come here is the food.  Morton's typically has some fixed-price menu options that they don't advertise, but the servers will tell you about them if you ask.  My wife and I had the $60 Steak and Seafood special, which is a great deal.  We started with the chopped spinach salad with warm bacon dressing, which tastes amazing.  The main course was a filet with your choice of seafood item, I chose the lump crab cake and my wife had the Shrimp Alexander, both excellent.  We got the lyonnaise potatoes and green beans as sides and both were great.  You get a choice of dessert with this deal, so I went with the chocolate lava cake, my personal favorite.  Lots of places do the chocolate lava cake now, but none are as good as Morton's.  I didn't get it this visit, but I would also highly recommend the Cajun Ribeye.  It is simply one of the most flavorful steaks you will ever have."}
{"text":"Mediocre is the best I can say.  Had a wonderful time catching up with an old friend, but the food sure didn't cut it.  Very attentive staff, let us linger & talk with no problem.  Expected a more refined level of service at a place like this, but can tell it's a corporate thing & not the server at all!

Food, only average. Ex foodie here, so I have a general clue.  Hmmm, high end steak house..... anyone there know how to cook a steak???  Rare/Med Rare came out medium at best, both me & my dining partner.  French onion soup, darn wish they didn't open a can with this one.  Lyonnaise potatoes, yeck!  I sure expect a lot more at $100 a pop.  Texas Roadhouse or Logan's beat this anyday.... price and quality."}
{"text":"If you want to be pampered, you've picked the right place! My boyfriend called ahead and told the staff that it was our one year anniversary (dating). I suppose the waiters got the wrong idea and thought he meant marriage as he called me \"beautiful bride\" when I sat down at the table. The waiter was extremely friendly and seemed to truly be interested in our relationship. He even had our anniversary date printed on our menu and took a picture of us and framed it for us. We order the filet mignon with mashed potatoes. My boyfriend absolutely loved it! I'm not the biggest steak fan, but I will say it was quite delicious. The dessert was to die for! Chocolate cake with fresh berries...Mmmm. If you want a romantic night out with delectable food, this place won't let you down."}
{"text":"Short and sweet.... this place is amazing.  

Be prepared to pay for the 5 Star service, but worth every penny.  Steaks done to perfection (Pittsburgh Rare seems to be impossible for most restaurants to understand).  The cheesecake is flown in from NY and has to be the best I have ever had - not to be taken lightly as this is only desert I will ever eat.

I would go there every day if I could.

Kudos Morton's, I could not have been more pleased!"}
{"text":"The bone in rib eye keeps me coming back... juicy, tender, crispy-fatty and with intense steak taste, they always make me fat and happy. The other cuts (which my husband orders for some unknown reason, and I try) are good but aren't the standouts like the rib eye. It's all about the beef here, and if that's not what you are seeking, you'll be left wondering what the fuss is about. 

I know, it's a chain, it's as un-hip as it comes, but some days the dark \"good ol' boys\" atmosphere is perfect for tucking oneself away in a booth and devouring a hunk of beef and bottle of wine. There are simply times when it feels good to just be part of the middle-aged crowd and treated like a grown up. Heck, mid 40s is downright YOUNG here! 

At the bar, a sliced NY strip is available, which the husband and I sometimes share. Many think the bar is too small, but if you come early it's usually almost empty, the martini selection is great, and the bartenders are personable. 

Service runs from good to excellent. last night my husband ordered a glass of Australian zin that was so oaky if was like licking a board. The server observed that the wine wasn't being enjoyed and insisted on taking it off the bill despite our insisting that we 9ok, my hubby) chose, so we're happy to pay for it. they brought us a taste of an alternative which was very tasty (and not over-oaked, indicating 1) we should have asked them for advice; and 2) they know their wines, but selected a couple nice glasses of port instead. 

Another big selling point is the AMC theater upstairs, a perfect place to sit and let the food and wine metabolize before driving home."}
{"text":"Not impressed!  Was looking forward to a really great ribeye and after cutting a bunch of grizzle away, it was just okay - perfect temp and a great portion, but again, just okay. I've had better sirloin's at much less expensive prices. The Morton salad was overdressed but the mushroom side was very good - they brought the steak up a bit. Brussel sprouts are all the rage lately, but Morton's fell short - over-grilled and bland. Really a sub par steakhouse in my opinion and definitely not up to the hype. Should have gone with a local place."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest, always tried to avoid commercialized resterants living on 4th and having so many local chefs with local restaurants, but Morton's is hands down, by far the best steak house I have ever been too!  The cuts of meat where the best I have ever seen, the decor was perfect, and the service was perfect!!!!  Good work guys!!!!"}
{"text":"We got to Morton's Steakhouse about 8pm and was greeted and seated immediately. Couldn't happen to notice that they personalized our menu's to say \"Happy Birthday\" for John!  Our waiter, Martin, was superb in explaining the menu! Everything sounded so yummy and it was hard to make a decision. So we went with every recommendation that Martin gave us! 

To start John ended up ordering the Sliced beefsteak tomato salad with blue cheese dressing. He shared one bit of that with me, which made my Caesar Salad seem less tasty and refreshing! It was the perfect combination of salad/dressing/awesomeness!! 

For dinner John got a Cajun marinated rib eye steak - if your mouth isn't watering now, it should be! It was the perfect blend of spices! Yup, he shared that with me too! 

I ordered the petite filet which was oh-so-tender! The knife went through each of our cuts like warm butter! To end our meal, the staff took a picture of us and comp'd our Legendary Morton's Hot Chocolate Cake! Order this ahead of time because it takes about 15 minutes to prepare! Well worth it though!!! It was topped with Powdered Sugar, Raspberries, and served with a side of Breyer's Vanilla Ice Cream. 

This was the absolute best meal I have ever had in my life! Can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here over this weekend with my lady and my 2 kids. I enjoyed the New York Strip. Yummy.
Yes it was late and yes it's so not kid friendly. I'm just saying. lol"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, it does suck that it isn't really near the strip. The service is great! I came here for my friend's 21st birthday and had taken pictures for us and even printed them out for us. They definitely made the night memorable. The drinks we ordered were extremely strong. I had the new york strip(medium well), and it was good but a bit too charred on the top for me. This is definitely a nice place."}
{"text":"Very sad experience. Have been to several Morton's and this experience was the worst. The service is good but the food is mediocre. I felt like we were eating at a casino restaurant. Not the same as other Morton's and will not return. A shadow of what it used to be and i certainly would not recommend it to others - there are plenty of other restaurants where the kind of money you send here is better spent. Save your money!"}
{"text":"We find ourselves at Morton's about 4 times a year.  The food is rarely a let down.  The steaks have been perfect, the potatoes delicious, and the desserts to die for.  However, the service, or rather the servers, leave a lot to be desired.  To put it bluntly, we have consistently better servers at Applebee's and Outback.  The men who have waited on us at the Pittsburgh Morton's act as if they hate being there.  We often feel like we're prodding them for information because they do not speak to us unless they absolutely have to.  Our most recent visit was three nights ago and we had the worst service to date.  The server was lazy, far too laid back, and truly should not have been working in such an expensive establishment.  We asked him questions about the special (he denied there being one and there was), about a chicken dish (his response to how the Chicken Christopher was prepared - \"It's, like, well, ya know, just regular fried chicken\"....he could not have made it sound less appealing and it's most definitely nothing like regular fried chicken), about the way a dessert is served (he told me the fruit crisp was absolutely berries, but once ordered what was served was apples), and he was obviously put out by such questions.  The price of the meals and the service are absolutely not in line at this location."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review, by letting people know that the Morton's team got a hold of me. They set us up at the Scottsdale location with a pretty substantial gift certificate. Both GM's at each location were kind and courteous.  There is only one reason I can not give five stars.  Simply put, Morton's just doesn't have the bang for the buck when it comes to food. Yes, the food is good. Yes the streaks were good. Yes the steaks and sides were big enough to share. Standard restaurant has 100 to 150 percent mark up on wine. That means a 15 dollar bottle of wine is 30 to 45 dollars. I paid 60 dollars for a $13 bottle of wine. 21 Dollars for a shrimp Cocktail with 2 shrimp. Please understand I realize you pay for ambiance and yes I know the steaks are USDA prime."}
{"text":"I can remember going her as a kid with my family for any fancy or special occasion. It just brings back great memories. Prom, birthdays, holidays, etc.... It was our go to place 

I've been here a few times over the years but not as regular as we used to. Made my reservations on open table. On a Friday night I would have thought it would be crowded but there were only 7 tables. 

I have to say our server was great and could not have done a better job. 

I ordered my app which I was really excited for but unfortunately it was not good. I only had s few bites. And left the rest untouched. multiple employees came by but didn't say anything. I found this very surprising but I really don't like to send food back. But this was finally addressed by the Mgr at the end of the night. And they gladly took it off the bill. 

Wife's meal was a special. She enjoyed the fish but the taste was just bland. 

Now in was hoping for lobster but they were out. So i opted for king crab. They were cooked perfectly but I question portion. I ordered 1lb. And got 1 crab leg or approx 4 bites. I actually got one leg split into two halves. I think it was a good size but no even close to 1 lb. 

Sides missed the mark. Asparagus still had the white part and had wayyyyy to much balsamic glaze. 

Potatoes were covered in grease. 

Sorry but with all the new choices and new places in the burgh..... Prob won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"How this place got 4 stars when there are so many better options in Pittsburgh is beyond me.  The only thing that was noteworthy about the experience here was the price. The food was bland. Nothing to write home about. The place looks uppity, but really the food is just ok. Go to Ruth's Chris instead."}
{"text":"A very fancy and expensive restaurant.
Amazing steaks. Everything was delicious and came in huge portions.
They have a secret promotion that they do not have on the menu which includes dinner for 1 person and you get steak (Fliet Mignon, ribeye, ny strip, etc.) and seafood (Your choice of shrimp, crabcakes)  a salad, 1 extra side and desert all for $50 dollars. It's a lot of food though, so it can be shared between two people even though it's not supposed to. It's not on the menu because they want you to spend more the $50 worth of food.

Our bill had a 50% off discount because a friend from my party also works in a Morton's in Miami.

I would eat here again if I can afford it."}
{"text":"We arrived from the Airport, and were greeted by Matthew and welcomed to the best steak house in the area. We were so glad to have arrived and looked forward to our amazing dinner. Our Server Bryan did not disappoint - the pre dinner drinks - the food and the wine were delivered in exquisite fashion. Thank you all for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Morton's = Awesome! My husband and I celebrated our 30th anniversary today, July 20, 2015. The staff offered us an evening of surprises from the warm bread and butter to dessert! The steak was amazing (cooked as requested) as well as the seafood.  The bartender was not shy with the Grey Goose or Patron. Very \"full bodied\" drinks.  :) Stephanie, our waitress was amazing!  Very knowledgeable and patient.  Thanks Stephanie! The surprises? ....personalized menus, framed photo of me and my husband and dessert on the house!  Morton's is somewhat pricey but definitely worth an evening of feeling like royalty!"}
{"text":"I suppose the decor / ambience is nice if that's what you care about. Me, I'm all about food when it comes to a restaurant, and this place is way over priced for average food. The steak was good, but not $50 good. I've had better $20 dollar steaks at restaurants, and could make a better steak at home for under $10. The caesar salad was good, it was large and a standard caesar; The asparagus was not good, it had a sweet sauce on it I didn't care for, though I'm not a sweet guy; the fries were good, obviously; the mushrooms and spinach were whatever. 

Would not return."}
{"text":"Starting with a disclaimer: Morton's steakhouses have been perennially on my 'top 5 North American steak houses list', and all past experiences have been in US  locations.
For a special Thursday night, after a week of slog, accompanied by a crew of 4 carnivores, the expectations were super high once the res was made via open table for Morton's steakhouse in Toronto. The valet parking for $12 was fast and efficient, the main floor dining room was packed to capacity at 7:30pm, the table we got appeared to have been jammed in the middle of main passage than ran from the back to the front. The live menu presentation, although a bit tacky but amusing routine at every other Morton I have been to, was skipped here. Ordered sides of asparagus, mushroom & spinach,  skinny potato fries and garlic mash. Asparagus were perfectly sautéed and juicy, and were clear stand out among sides. The mains were filet and rib eye, medium rare. Mine 12 oz filet was ordered oscar style, which basically comes with a heap of crab meat on top of filet. The rib eye drew smiles from around the table, but the filet, while thick and juicy, had too much fat content, and way below the caliber I expect from Morton's. 
The desserts were the easy picks, as nobody does molten chocolate cake and soufflés better than Morton's. The molten chocolate cake was precisely the way it always is, crunchy and puffy on the outside, molten on the inside and yum, but soufflés at Morton's of TO were an absolute sorry incarnations of their US counterparts. 

This steakhouse is definitely a power place on Toronto steak scene, but don't go there thinking the Morton 's of US experience."}
{"text":"Parent's came for a surprise visit and my dad had wanted to go to a premium steakhouse for a while. 

Let's start with the positives:
Caesar salad was nice in taste but the portion was small. We got 2 salads to share for 4 people. Tasted nice, just felt small.
Wife got the seabass which was amazing. Super flaky and prepared nicely in a lemon sauce
Parm + truffle fries ... yummy in my tummy :)
Excellent service. Constantly going above and beyond

Negatives
I've come to the conclusion that Charlotte loves their sea salt. My father's and I 12 Oz filet were filled with salt. 
Steaks arrived cold. Last morton experience at a different location had the steaks sizzling 
Fries that we got were cold. Based on this and our steaks they are not timing their food preparation properly."}
{"text":"A secret at mortons  is the Internet  special , for $65 you receive a choice if ceasar salad or mortons house salad ,a loaf of great bread, a rib eye steak ,with a side of crab caked , bacon rapped scallops or shrimp, and a additional side of mushrooms ,creamed spinich or potato ,followed by a desert with choice of chocolate cake or l key lime pie. If you ordered this all seperatly it would be at least $100 ,but you must ask for the Internet special , they never advertise it.I went last night and I hardly could walk out I was so full"}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING and the highlight of the evening. The food was insulting for the price. Although the steak was edible it's no Ruth's Chris. The atmosphere was very nice as well but I'm not sure how much longer they can stay in business with this quality of food."}
{"text":"I had the lobster bisque and prime rib. Worst soup I've ever eaten, but the prime rib makes up for it. 

The meat is amazing. The atmosphere is kind of old-man-ish in the same way Barbarian's is. Overall pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"I was debating if I should give Morton's a 3 or 4-star rating, didn't quite make it to 3.75 for rounding, so it's 3.

Food was good, but with the price I paid, in my opinion, I would alter my choice to Ruth Chris or Mastro's City Hall for better. For their first time guest, they literally 'presented' the menu right in front of you, I mean, they had their broccolis, onions, raw steaks and fish on a cart and showed to you, that's what you're going to get. Really? 

We had their Morton's salad (with anchovies? not a big fan), the salad is fresh, but dressing was a bit over; my medium rare single-cut filet was done perfect, tender and juicy, it was great! Also both of our sides, sauteed green bean and steamed asparagus were really good! Chocolate mousse for desert on the other hand, was just a-ok, I'd expect more than just the mousse at this kind of restaurant. Creativity?

Service was great! I like that they took the time and made a little special for a bday reservation (menu with happy birthday and signs on table), and took a picture of us to keep."}
{"text":"Always great atmosphere and food, had 3 lbs., lobster and porterhouse."}
{"text":"Had a great meal last week. Double cut filet steak was great. Nice potato. Broccoli was a tad too crunch   Wine was very good.  All in all well done Morton's."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a show downtown. 
Top-notch dining experience! Great relaxing atmosphere, very professional and elegant. 
I had the duck, which was delicious. Ended with the cheesecake (a classic). 
Pricey for 2 people and drinks, but absolutely justified with the excellent dishes and atmosphere. This food was SO good! 
Great for a romantic evening or a special night with out of town guests."}
{"text":"When you want GREAT quality steaks done right there is no better place. As always a delight and loved the steaks,,, I dine in Singapore, Hong Kong, Seattle and Bev Hills Morton's and they NEVER stop to amaze me, love it"}
{"text":"Dined there on Saturday 7-19-14 during restaurant week with two other couples (one of them it was their third time and now possibly their last).  The dining experience is not only the food but ambience and service.  The service was way too quick and felt like in a drive-thru instead of a relaxing evening out with friends and sensed wanted us out there as soon as possible.  As all the courses are ordered in the beginning absolutely no time in between to savor the course as the plates were whipped away as soon as we had eaten and the next course placed in front of us.  We were not even asked if we would like coffee so decided to leave without ordering any. We had an early reservation and most of the tables on the upper level where we were seated were empty.  As diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good. When one of the managers came over discreetly mentioned the service and called today as well.  An apology was given with a please come back to the restaurant as this is not usually how Morton's does business.  No offer of enticement though.  Food for the most part was good although one of the filets was stringy and inedible but that can happen sometimes.  We all left disappointed and especially the couple that raved about it and asked us to join them."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight for Father's Day. Beyond great service. I had the Father's Day special, that came with a Caesar salad, filet mignon, a side of my choice and a desert all for 59$. The filet was delish, so tender and savory. Mother loved the baked 5 onion soup and the veal chop. Dad had center cut prime ribeye and he LOVED it. 

Now on to the waitress, Jane was not only very attentive, but she was hilarious as well. Many very polite servers and I believe managers were always on deck. We, not for a minute, felt unattended. 

Now on to prices: for four of us and we each had a full on 3 course meal, as well as wine, margaritas and 3 shots of Hennessy with desert and coffee came out to 430$ including a 50 dollar tip. 

WELL WORTH IT! Great restaurant, I'd recommend it to those that love restaurants such as durants, Donovan's, Dominique's, brio etc. quite similar."}
{"text":"Sadly dissatisfied with the food.

My husband and I came to this restaurant expecting cuisine as full and rich as the ambience. We were sadly disappointed. Though the decor was stunning, the dining left plenty to be desired. I ordered filet minion prepared well , but emphasized I didn't want it to be charred. To my disappointment It came to our table burned, and completely changed the texture of the meat (of which is usually the finest cut.) It was very hard to chew to say the least. The potatoes we very bland , although the creamed spinach was at a perfect temp and quite tasty. My husbands pork chop was nothing above what you'd expect from a local restaurant with maybe a  2 to 3 Star review. The service was average. I'm just highly disappointed for a bill of that amount ... the quality of food just didn't \"add up.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our nice Honeymoon dinner. We were a little disappointed. The service was good, our server was beyond nice and very informative, but we were a little disappointed in the food for the cost. We each got a salad (which wasn't anything exciting), a steak (he got the strip, and I got the filet.. which was only 6oz.) one side each (which were terrible reheated,) and he had 2 drinks, I had 3.. with a 20% tip included, our total bill was $270. It was outrageous. I knew that it was going to be expensive, which wasn't an issue but it wasn't the \"best food I've ever had in my life.\" The week before, we went to Longhorn with my parents, where I got a bigger filet, for a much cheaper cost, and taste and quality, they were honestly the same!! I would've have been perfectly content with spending such a large amount if the food would have been worth it, but it wasn't at all."}
{"text":"Food quality is good but the service was terrible. Went there last night for a friends birthday. The over aggressive waiter told me that what I was ordering was no good and tried to up sell us multiple times, followed up by worst service I've even seen at a fine steakhouse. We left the waiter a 10% tip as a result. As we were pull out of the parking lot he ran out and gave us the sarcastic salute. We went back in and demanded the rest of the tip back, which was returned to us by the manager."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Charlotte! The steaks are so tender & juicy there is no substitute for that beef. I'm also very impressed with chefs that know how to cook a steak to order, every time. We have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered, entrees to side dishes or deserts. Its all high quality food and super delicious. Whenever my husband and I get to treat ourselves we always choose Morton's, we love it!"}
{"text":"Usually, I keep away from chain's such as Morton's. & Ruth Chris which have good reputations, not only because of the price (exceeds my regular budget) but also the size of the portions are far to large for my small appetite. However, I recently was out dining alone and as had a craving for a steak, I decided to give Morton's a try. I sat at the bar and as they had a \"Happy Hour\" menu I ordered from it, and found that the service, size and price was just \"What the Doctor ordered!\". As an added benefit, I was seated next to a good conversationalist, a single out-of-town tourist visiting Toronto for the first time. For those who wish to use the TTC, the unique Museum subway station is just one block away."}
{"text":"We had really good server. And they let me pick my steak before it was cooked. That was the positive part. The food was just average. I've had much better steak at other places. But over all we had a good night."}
{"text":"Morton's steakhouse offers the best steak in Scottsdale.  The Prime Rib end cut is very flavorful.  This place always brings in a big crowd for dinner and the ambiance is very nice.   It's not exactly a five star food quality  like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse but it's good food and great service.   Everything is served ala carte like most high end steakhouses and be sure to order a bottle of red wine to go with your steak as they have a nice wine menu."}
{"text":"Save your money.  ordered milk for the kids and it was sour. waiter took it back but he did not apologize for the the milk. Appetizers, scallops was rubbery, shrimp alexander was okay.  
double cut filet was tender, rib eyes and that include the bone it had a lot of cartilage and was not the best I have.  we did mention to our waiter that there was a lot of meat that was indigestible but he did not want to hear  the comments.  he pretty much ignored us.  the chocolate dessert was awesomel.  for what they charge. not worth your money."}
{"text":"Im not big on spending big bucks for chain dining experiences, so the only thing that attracted me to Mortons was their publicized \"Power Hour\" in the bar.   Having frequented the Denver Mortons version during the first year of the Great Recession, I enjoyed the experience and thought Id give Cleveland's  a try.

Pricing is OK, but not extraordinarily inexpensive.   Id recommend the cheeseburger sliders, although others at the table had the filet mignon bites.   The fries and the chips with blue cheese are also tasty ... 

Id pass on the garlic breadsticks with \"blue cheese fondue\" next time,  First off, when you think fondue, you think \"dipping into luscious bubbling pots of cheese or chocolate.\".   What Mortons apparently thinks of is a thin pool of blue cheese sauce gathered under a stack of said breadsticks.

Secondly, the bread itself seemed like it was Wonder Bread sliced into thick sticks.   Passable?   Yes.   Calorie-worthy?   No.    Fondue?    Definitely not.

Palm Beacher cocktail was weak and barely tasted of alcohol.   Go for a dirty Vodka martini with blue cheese olives.   Just right.

Our server was \"meh\".

Overall, B- to C+"}
{"text":"The food was just average but the service was very rushed!  Pushed in and out of there in an hour.  Would not go back again.  One of the quickest ways to spend $250!"}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience at all.  My husband and I went out for our anniversary and the food was not good.  I love steak, but don't eat steak unless it is a special occasion and I thought that this would be a perfect place to go.  The steak was horrible, as a matter of fact I had to ask for steak sauce (which you should not have to do if the steak is cooked right).  After mentioning it to our waitress, she tried to explain to me that it was supposed to taste burnt (when I ordered it medium done).  When the manager stopped by, I mentioned it to her, and she also didn't seem to think it was a big deal and offered me steak sauce instead of a new steak ( which we paid $45 for).  Needless to say I then felt like our waitress rushed us out as she put the bill down on our table before we were even done eating!  We have been to a lot of upscale restaurants and I was just not impressed with this one at all..."}
{"text":"It was the bar specials sign that gave me a craving for sliders while walking home from work one night.  My husband and I went in for Cheeseburger sliders and Petite Filet  Mignon sandwiches.  Combine this with the drink specials and you have a winning combination.

The bar area is cozy and separated from the main dining area in it's own room.  The dark wood and warm colors make it an inviting place for a small bite (though portions were a meal size for me).  There are a couple tables, a few high tops and a decent amount of seating at the bar."}
{"text":"Morton's is our default steakhouse for any occasion; they are consistently excellent from the service to food. 

Unfortunately, yesterday evening was not one of those experiences. First of all, if you're going to send an email offering a complimentary dessert for a birthday celebration, you probably shouldn't turn around and charge for it. We ended up paying for the dessert since it felt awkward at the end of the meal to ask them to take it off. One of the filets at the table was between medium and medium rare, despite being ordered as medium well.

On the service side, was also very unimpressed with the waitress. Generally disengaged, only came around four times throughout the entire meal, and hovered around the table during payment. 

While the restaurant still remains a favourite, this was nonetheless a disappointing experience given the expectations and the price point."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I ordered the American waygu. I wouldn't recommend it. If you've eaten real waygu before, this steak would taste horrible. Granted the steak was good, nice and tender, but no where near what I expect from \"waygu.\"  Because of my visit here I now always ask if the waygu is real deal Japanese waygu or the American waygu junk.  I hate getting tricked with American waygu. Lol. 

By the way the American \"waygu\" steak was like 80 bucks or something. I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"It was okay not the best, I mean the price they asking I can go to Ruth's and Chris and have a way better steak. One of the lady's there that took are reservation over the phone was very mean forgot her name know she has blonde hair, so when we booked over the phone she didn't even ask us if we wanted a custom menu we had to ask before she wanted to.end the call so she said okay we will have it for you and asked the names and what we wanted on there, also said if we are a few minutes late they will charge my card $100 so we was going to be late so I called talked to some gentleman and told him I might be 15 or 20miins late and I don't want to be charged $100 he said no problem just come in before we close.. So that lady is a jerk that said if we  was few mins late I would be charged, and when we got there our custom menus was not even there how sad"}
{"text":"Morton's is what it is - a stuffy restaurant that markets itself as a high-end steakhouse and sells meat and booze at marked-up prices, while overwhelming you with good service.

These places aren't my cup of tea. I like to think that I can get a better dining experience elsewhere at half the price.

The steak I had was good, but it's hard to justify the price unless you make a boatload of cash or you just don't care.

Morton's is good for special occasions, but after going once I don't see the point in returning."}
{"text":"To all: Morton's contacted me and has sent a $50 gift certificate for our lousy dinner January 22.  Our dinner for two was $160 +tip.  $50 is not working for me.  Just thought I would let them know??  I hope everyone has better success than we did.  Good luck all.

{"text":"Wow, they know how to cook a steak!

I took my husband for our anniversary and he was practically giggling every time he took a bite of his Porterhouse because he thought it was so good!

We will be back"}
{"text":"Great steak.  I ordered the porterhouse cooked medium and it certainly did not disappoint.  The cesar salad was nothing special.  The lobster bisque was outstanding.  Service was about what I expected.  They go out of the way to meet your every need.  Personally, I don't really like that kind of over the top service, but I know this is how these places roll, so I can put up with it."}
{"text":"Went here with high expectations since it's a high price restaurant but left disappointed. Food was ok at best and at those prices you should leave feeling like you had the best meal ever and that didn't happen. 80.00 dollar steak was tough, the sea bass was oily not flaky like it should be. Disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding, Justin was our waiter and didn't miss a beat. Great personality and very thorough with the menu. Great recommendations and it was a great time. We were celebrating my son's 18th birthday. I made reservations and let them know that it was my son's birthday, they printed his name on the menus and said happy 18th birthday on top, nice touch. 
The food was very good but the quality to price I think was too expensive. I had an 8oz Filet and ordered it medium, it was a little overcooked for my taste and too dry. But other than that it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I took my boyfriend for his birthday. Definitely make reservations! They asked if it was for a special occasion.  we arrived we were greeted with happy birthday wishes, and we sat down to a table with menus that were made for him for his birthday. We got to take them home as well. They took a picture of us and put it in a nice frame. I ordered the secret garden cocktail which was amazingly refreshing. He ordered a rye whiskey drink. both were amazing. we than ordered an mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto. TO DIE FOR!!!! I ordered the Cajun aged rib eye. He is had the 5 peppercorn streak. I loved it!!! soo worth it. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 rating was the service once at the table was rough. 
It took forever to get our drinks. The waiter came down to our table to talk to us about specials they had, and we told him we were ready to order and he told us to think about it and walked away....."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I get to dress up and take my wife you to a nice place every once in a while, we come here. I get the Cajun Rib-eye and mac and cheese. It's a little pricey, but worth it. Waiter is allays nice and helpful. Never had a bad experience in the 5 years we've been."}
{"text":"This is my first post. I'm also in the service industry. This restaurant experience was by far the worst I've ever experienced in fine dining. I'm sure it will be closed soon. Service and food was way below par. We had a table of six, two birthdays which we called ahead for. It took them 15-20 min to bring our drinks which the server got wrong. Took them another 20-30 min to f-up one side salad order. Also, our dinner orders were wrong. I asked for a 6oz fliet and got salmon. I got my entree when everyone was finished and they never apologized. We had to send a smoke signal to our server. Ther restaurant was only a 1/4 full of tables that were busy on a Friday . Food was NOT worth the money and never acknowledged our two birthdays. We brought all complaints to management and he looked at us like he could care less. We paid our bill like troopers, no apologies from management, no tip, which is not in my very being. Soo disappointed. I'm trying to get our money back. It's just principle. I could have had a better quicker meal at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We had dinner tonight and were so disappointed. We had a party of 15 and the service was so slow we ended up serving the cake ourselves. The food was bland at best. They do not have a children's menu. The only thing that was efficient was the valet service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Was looking for restaurant for my birthday and mortons was a great choice highly recommended for special occasions. Good Service waiter was very attentive even though it was busy. Seafood was off the chain macaroni and lobster can't say enough."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed an anniversary dinner that topped many a meals over the years. The personalized printed menu's were just a start of a comfortable yet elegant evening.  The sight menu where they present the cuts/grades of meat and portions was a hit!  Afterall, most of us eat with our eyes anyway.  We selected the surf and turn special, which is not always mentioned ..so ask about it. We both selected a salad, filet for our turf, however I selected the stuffed shrimp and my husband had the scallops for our surf part of the meal.  The shrimp was delicious and huge, enough to share with my husband - as long as he shared his awesome tasting scallops. We also shared our sides...the asparagus was Amazing!, yes, with a capital A.  While at  the Morton's in Vegas we have had the macaroni & cheese - (not for kids - lil kick to it) but they have removed it from the menu.  (It is a good thing I bought Morton's cookbook so we can make it at home too --- soooo good!).  The dinner ended with their famous lava cake....OMG!!, and since we shared that, we took my husbands key lime pie home.
 The service was fabulous...very attentive without being annoying.  Top of the line restaurant but for me, it is for special occasions only. A little pricey, just like most 4 or 5 star restaurants."}
{"text":"As an ex-fine dining server I expected so much more from this place.  

First time at Mortons, things ranged from average to just lame.  The service (for fine dining) was comical.  I'm going to give the server the benefit of the doubt that he was just off his game - frankly the whole place seemed like it was off its game this past Tuesday.  We were seated at a table for 4 (there were only two of us) but the other two place settings weren't removed until well after our drinks arrived (server got 1 of 2 drink orders wrong).  When the settings were removed they were placed right next to us on the platform that separates the booths (so right in our eye line and 6 inches further than they were before).  That stack wasn't removed until after our appetizers were finished.  The Bibb salad was fantastic, shrimp cocktail was 'meh' (but its shrimp cocktail - frankly its always 'whatever').  I like my steak blue, so I ordered the filet mignon.  It was cooked beautifully - however after one bite I couldn't stomach more - I couldn't taste the steak - just salt.  I'm not a salt fan in general so I couldn't eat it.  My date's steak was also cooked perfectly, but he too said it was really salty (and he loves salt).  The sides were crap - spinach and mushrooms - zero flavour - mushrooms were poorly cooked and the cheese potato thing - again, forgettable.  Both the server and the maitre d asked if everything was okay - I was honest but not complaining - I didn't ask them to remove it from my bill and I was beyond ordering another steak - since it is clearly how they cook their steaks and I think you should only ask for a comp if it isn't done properly - this is clearly how they 'flavor' their steaks.  Then the dessert came - the chocolate souffle was cooked well but only tasted like eggs, I honestly wondered if they forgot to put the chocolate in the batter (it was beige, not brown - it was gross - the cream compliment that came with it was good - but when i asked what was in it, the server didn't know.  That was weird to me - you're a fine dining server - aren't you suppose to know this stuff.  I will say my date  has been to Morton's before and the girl who served them was phenomenal so I'm going to say only this guy was the epic fail.

All in all, for a 300 dollar dinner - I wouldn't go back.  I do wonder if it was just an off night but for that amount of money, its not worth testing the theory."}
{"text":"Overpriced for an over salted steak with veggies that taste like those from Hometown Buffet.  This is the old west.  We got robbed by Morton's!"}
{"text":"Again a great time at Mortons in Las Vegas.  Brian was great.  The service was on time without having the feeling of being rushed.  The food was great."}
{"text":"We came in late at 9:30 on a friday night after being turned away by another place at 8:50. Mortons was happy to see us! They treated us beautifully. I had the filet and my husband had the rib eye. A lucious dinner with all the trimmings. Pricey yes, but at least you get the very best here. Our server was wonderful and she made us laugh the entire evening. A wonderful place and it was beautiful and very club like inside."}
{"text":"The food was incredible. Four stars for the food. I did the prix fixe menu ($85), which was enough for two people.

The service was wooden. Two stars. The servers weren't into it, and their presentation was blasé. They were also uninterested in refilling my Diet Cokes.

The Vegas economy is down, and even though it was a Saturday night, the place was almost empty. Thus, it's easy to understand why the servers were low energy. It must suck showing up for work knowing that you'll only have a few tables to get tips on.

Then again, I waited tables for two years. On slow nights, I hustled to squeeze an extra few percent out of my table. I left 15% on Saturday, although usually I leave 20-25%.

When the economy is down, you need more hustle - not less. And I say that as someone who has been poor and worked every sh!t job imaginable."}
{"text":"Jesus H. F***ING CHRIST this place has some good steaks. We ordered a bottle of red wine and the waiter really knew what he was talking about. I took a wine tasting glass and asked alot of stupid questions, more so then i normally do and who knew?! Lil'bastard studied up on the list. The service was top notch. No glass ever went dry. They would have given me a backrub if I asked, and I thought about it but it would be wierd because I was with a bunch of dudes and I make noises when my back gets rubbed, ya know?. Its pricey, but very much worth it. A friend reported the \"meat sh**s\" the next moring (as its technically called). He was of course, eating 24 oz.'s  Of rare cooked porterhouse steak and finished it all, anyone would in that case... And that goes for anywhere. The sides were stupid good. And the dessert cheesecake was epic. The coffee even tasted high quality. My wallet was very light after."}
{"text":"Came only for the Souffle and WOW! Gran Marnier Souffle was to die for!!! The Orange zest gave it that extra oomph. Most I've paid for a dessert in a long time but boy, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Simply dreadful, lackluster service, and grossly overpriced for the level of quality and customer experience provided.  This location was full of some scummy looking \"characters\".  We weren't sure where they came from, but it definitely distracted , and detracted from what eating in a higher end restaurant should be.  

Our server was not very warm, friendly, or polite.  During one part of our meal, another server carried a gigantic tray of food directly over our entire small table.  I had to duck, or I would have been hit in the head with a tray of hot food.  We received no apology, or acknowledgement the we were placed in an inconvenient, dangerous, and uncomfortable situation.  

Our overpriced cocktails were not prepared correctly.  I had to send mine back, and an additional charge appeared on our bill for correcting it!  What kind of place does that?!?!?!  

Our entrees were prepared in an acceptable manner, but side dishes were very boring, and only mediocre at best.
We regularly dine at Flemming's, another upscale steakhouse, and Morton's paled in comparison.  Not even close to the same type of clientele, service, or food.  Just skip this place!  There are much better options Downtown that actually get upscale dining right.  If I could have given them one quarter of one star, as a rating, I definitely would have."}
{"text":"I've dined  here several times, but never thought to review it,
until now. That maybe because eating at Morton's means I'm taking a break from my low sodium low everything diet. That diet
considers bananas and milk to be the faire of the doomed and screw them for thinking that way. Bring on the Last Supper!\"``
I usually order the Filet Mignon and my paramour/date orders something vegetarian(not to remind me of the error of my ways,
but to put a pall over what would normally be an occasion like
a dental visit without cavities or her commitment to universal suffrage.
Why bother? Bitches be strange creatures lemme tellya'll).
The Filet ala Morton is an art form. Done to a turn(medium rare),
washed down by drafts of Guiness(not advised by savvy gourmands), and complemented by a baked potato reminiscent
of the willowy white clouds the heavens would be proud of. 
Whoever has raised the cattle and supervised the selection of
cuts from those cattle that adorn the plates of Mortonistas
like myself, is invaluable to the enterprise. And deserves all
the kudos he's been given.
Bring a few dollars with you, they're not giving it away."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Morton's. Celebrating my wife and sons girlfriend's birthday and everything was perfect. From the service to to the food to the cocktails, everything was top notch. Had the bacon steak (yes bacon steak) and shared a filet with my wife. Lobster Mac and Cheese was superb. Definitely expensive but if you want to splurge a little this is the place."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were excellent. The atmosphere is much different than the other steak houses around charlotte. The waitress was very knowledgable and the mixed drinks were delicious. We did not have reservations but were kindly greeted and seated quickly. Expensive, but would come back for a special occasion for sure."}
{"text":"I went there for my wedding anniversary. 
The food was good the drinks were good
My server was pleasant and knowledgeable 
Of the menus. My only complaint is that there were some females who obviously had to much wine being loud and obnoxious. They should have been cut off or at least asked to leave."}
{"text":"I really liked everything about my husband's birthday dinner here, except for what you get for the price.  The steak was \"eh-ok\", not a $60 steak.  I'd rather go to another place and pay $30 where the steak comes out the same and is a more lively environment.  The server was great, though when I asked for a wine recommendation, she went straight for the most expensive.  

How they treat you for a special occasion in awesome!  \"Happy Birthday's\" from everyone we contacted, \"Happy Birthday Matt\" at the top of our custom menus.  A photo printed out and put into a card for us to take home and a complimentary dessert!

If it wasn't for all the special occasion stuff, the hostess and server being great (other than the recommendation of the most expensive glass of wine) it would probably only be 3-star for food and environment.  It was pretty dark and quiet, definitely a good intimate vibe but would not recommend for business meetings and such.  Probably not worth the cost overall."}
{"text":"My friend and I had tickets to see Carlos Santana at the Joint and on a whim we decided to have dinner at Morton's.  It was early (7:00pm) so we didn't have a problem getting a table. I am not much for the stuffiness of traditional steakhouses and I made numerous attempts with the server to take the formalities down a notch.  By dessert the server was cutting up with us finally.  But the service was great. My friend and I started off by sharing a Jumbo lump crab cake.  The portion was small, but was perfect for us because we were really saving room for dessert. For salad my friend ordered the Sliced Beefsteak Tomato and the server split it for us which was a nice touch. At this point we had to decide if were were going to have dessert because the hot desserts are baked fresh.  Both of us at this point had chocolate lava cake on the mind, so in the oven it went. For an entree we both ordered the sesame encrusted yellow-fin tuna.  We requested rare and it was served perfectly seared with a soy ginger sauce and wasabi on the side. With the entree we had ordered the Creamed Spinach and Potato Skins, which were hardly touched by either of us because the yellow-fin was such a huge portion.  My guess would be 6 ounces, which is comparable to Morton's steak portions.  I am not a big eater but I finished the yellow-fin because I couldn't bear to leave any of it, it was so good. And there it is. Nice and warm, served fresh from the oven with vanilla Haggen daz on the side, the perfect Lava cake.  We got so lost in the cake that when I gained consciousness and noticed the time it was 2 min before the concert was to start.  Luckily, Mr. Santana never starts on time. I am not a big meat eater and my friend is a pseudo vegetarian (seafood only), so it was ironic to find both of us in a famous steakhouse like Morton, but I have to say I was very please with dinner."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mortons for special occasions for the last 6 years. This last experience was by far the most disappointing. Party of 9 $1,200 bill. 3 sides came out late. I ordered the bone in fillet, they brought me a ribeye. I had to eat seperate from everyone else because i had to wait for the fillet. So I had to eat my sides cold. I took my parents out for their 32nd anniversary, and the food was a flop. I could tell there has been a new management change, and Im afraid it has brought the quality down. I will prob only go back for happy hours now."}
{"text":"It was a nice evening out. The service was wonderful. Steak was delicious but I'm not sure it was worth the money. It is very over priced for what we got."}
{"text":"The skinny, the fillet minion was tasty, tender, but a bit too salty. What really stood out were the mash potatoes and the double Chocolate Mousse. It came with the best Raspberry garnish ever! Service was excellent, but the decor is your standard bland upscale steakhouse look."}
{"text":"What a DISAPPOINTMENT! I made reservations, got seated right away and then it took 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us.  We were ready to walk out. Now, I thought this restaurant would be intimate and quiet.....guess again, we had to talk loudly to one another.  We also got dressed up only to find people wearing t-shirts, flip flops and shorts.  Way over priced for the service you get and the atmosphere.  The steak was good but the whole atmosphere ruined any chance of us ever going back.  The best part of our evening was the Valet guy, he was attentive and very polite!!  Never again will I go back."}
{"text":"Steak so delicious, you don't need a sauce. Excellent service. The Key Lime Pie Martini is incredible! Went for an anniversary dinner, and they really took care of us. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited Morton's last night for dinner before the show. After we were seated, our waiter greeted us shortly after with the menus. The menu has a perfect amount of options. Not too many and still enough to have a complete variety. Chicken, chops, seafood, and most important, STEAK! For a salad, we started off with the chopped spinach salad. It was perfect, as I am very particular with how my salads are dressed. The dressing wasn't dripping off, it was evenly and perfectly coated. I chose the 6 oz filet mignon, with 2 bacon wrapped scallops and 3 grilled shrimp for my dinner. It was more than enough. The steak was so tender and juicy! I would definitely go back to Morton's again and again for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"At the end of the day, you just want someone to take care of you.  OUR someone is the Gen'l Mgr, Michael Colleluori and bartender, Jared....we receive such great service and its the one place that we can go and KNOW that our food will arrive, hot and delicious.  Cajun style, bone-in Rib Eye, is what I'm talking about!!  Perfectly cooked (thanks, chef!) along with some lyonnaise potatoes and salad.  Topped off with heavenly cheesecake and now I just need someone to drive me home!  (which reminds me!  Shout out to the valet!!)  Thanks again for a great evening!"}
{"text":"I went to Mortons' Steakhouse for a treat.  My boyfriend and I just bought a renovation property that we are renovating so we thought we'd celebrate!  I've been to harbour sixty which is amazing  but I've heard great things about Mortons so I thought Id give them a try.  

I had the new york strip as I usually do at steak houses.  I'm not sure that I appreciate seeing the meat before it's cooked but i can see why others may want to see the cut.  I ordred my steak and of course at these places you have to order the sides separately.  I ordered garlic mash, and asparagus.  I also ordered a side of sliced tomato which I like with steak which was not on the menu.   I cut into my steak and it was a little overdone but still delicious. 

The food was ok...nothing to rant and rave about.  What really pissed me off was when the bill came.  Yes I expect to pay more at these expensive places but my special order of tomato slices was an additional $18!!! Are you kidding me $18 for a tomato!  Definitely left a sour taste in my mouth.  I think I will stick to harbour sixty when I want to treat myself!

The restuaryant itself is pretty dark and dungeon looking.  no outside view at least where we were sitting or most parts of the restaurant.  Service, not overly friendly but professional."}
{"text":"As a long time Morton's fan, I've never had a bad meal.  I've experienced Morton's all over the country and the only complaint is the Manager.  The Phoenix Morton's could be a booming success with a change in the leadership.  As a regular customer, on more than one occasion, I've witnessed very rude behavior."}
{"text":"Great dinner . Our server  Brian was attentive and accommodating .. Our steaks were excellent and since it was our anniversary we were given over the top service with dessert .."}
{"text":"I remember Morton's being amazing, but I don't know what happened. The service and staff were very friendly and nice, which is why I will give them 2 stars, but the food was terrible. I got the Caesar salad, which tasted like what a barnyard smells like, the steak and lobster tail (which were both extremely average and way over priced), and the chocolate cake (which was surprisingly good considering everything else I got was below average). The bill came out to $150. I feel like I could have spent half of that and received better tasting food from Outback. Save the money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Even though the new york strip I had was thick and juicy, it had no flavor. The baked potato was huge and good but the best thing about the whole evening was that molten godiva chocolate cake. WOW!!!!! Have to order it when you are seated as it takes about your whole meal to prepare as it is cooked to order. I warn you. This is awesomeness at its best."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed!  Morton's use to be the \"go to\" place for steak. The last two times I have been there were not good. It appears that the oven was too hot.  My steak was not cooked to the right temperature - well vs medium well. The bread was dark on the surface with the onion pieces black. Even dessert was over cooked and felt like eating fluff when usually it is flowing with chocolate.  On the other hand, the seafood was undercooked and the shrimp not deveined."}
{"text":"We ordered a filet mignon and it had no flavor at all. I mean zero, no salt , pepper, nothing. When I go to an expensive steakhouse with a 1000 degree steak oven/grill, I expect a crunchy seared outside with a soft tender inside - which is something I can not get at home with my GE oven. Well my home cooked steak was a thousand times better and more flavorful. Also, ordered the halibut and it was dry, no flavor and not worth the price. It must have been frozen. When asked how I liked the meal, I was honest and told them it was not good. The server was very good and they offered us free desert,  etc. but that's not what  we were looking for.  We just wanted a great meal and never got it. Also, ordered truffle fries and they brought regular fries and charged $13.00. Vegas has so many better steak places and I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided since we were visiting Scottsdale and part of the trip we had a tumultuous time we had to have a special dinner and treat. 

I booked a reservation on Open Table for the same day. When we entered the restaurant the maitre'd greeted us with a nice smile and hello. He notice we were both wearing dark pants and gave us black napkins to ensure that lint from the white napkins would not get on our dark clothing. 

We were seated immediately and given menus. The waiter came and got our drink orders and returned back with them in less than 5 minutes. 

We already knew what we wanted to order as I looked at the web site and noticed that Morton's had a special prixe fix menu. The menu was salad (wedge or caesar), fillet mignon, 1 side and a dessert for $109. 

My husband upgraded to the rib eye instead of having the single cut fillet mignon. Both steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection and the baked potato was HUGE! 

The waiter came with a tray of all the fixings needed to load up a potato. The only thing that was not on the tray was chives. When I asked for chives the waiter went back to the kitchen and immediately brought back chives and sprinkled them on my potato. 

The dessert was a choice of key lime pie or creme brulee which was exciting. Creme brulee is my favorite dessert and key lime pie is my husband's favorite. Needless to say we were satisfied all the way around. 

The waiter knew how much I loved creme brulee and when we got to the dessert course he joked that there was no creme brulee that day. I was briefly taken a back but the waiter could not hold a straight face and began laughing and said he was just kidding. It was really funny and we all had a good laugh. 

The food was great and the service was AWESOME!!! 

Thanks Morton's for making our visit that was full of drama much better and from then on the trip got better. 

Yes we will definitely visit Morton's in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I had the bone-in ribeye stake here and frankly, I was not impressed. The steak did not have enough flavor. I am a steak eater and I am not even sure if I had prime steak because the marbling was not there. I do not mind paying $50+ for steak but it has to have quality. I ordered a side of sauteed spinach and button mushrooms, which was mediocre. 

This is a very nice place but I am not sure about giving it four or five stars; maybe if the meal was less expensive."}
{"text":"We were among the first of a few tables to arrive on a Friday night. As our meal continued on, the dining room began to fill. Nice old-school atmosphere with Sinatra playing in the background. We were on limited time so we got perturbed waiting for menus. We didn't realize the menus don't come until the end of the presentation. Which adds some kitsch, we know what meat and veggies look like so we would've rather got straight to the point, but I digress.

We ordered a Caesar salad and jumbo shrimp cocktail to start. The Caesar was ordinary; heavy on dressing and the lettuce was limp. The shrimp cocktail was excellent. Additionally, the bread served is warm, flaky, buttery, with a hint of onion and poppy seed - delicious. 

Next, for the main course we selected the Chicago-style bone-in ribeye, And the double-cut filet mignon and we opted to share the baked potato and garlic green beans. The seasoning used on the steaks was saltier than we like. We were unimpressed by the bone-in steak, it was among the worst we've had. There was a considerable amount fat to work around and it wasn't nearly as tender or juicy as similar steaks had at Delmonico, STACK, SW. etc. The filet was tender and full flavored. The baked potato was just that and the garlic green beans were a standout.

Overall, the menu offers traditional steakhouse fare, service was excellent throughout the meal, and our total for dinner was $150 before tip. Felt that the meal was overpriced. In the future, I'd rather visit comparatively priced steakhouses in town that offer better quality steaks and/or more creative menus."}
{"text":"I come into town for business and every time I do I come here.  Why? Service and consistency.  The steak is always cooked EXACTLY the same way when I order it every time.
Levy and Gabriel are my go to servers.  They are the bomb.  I was there a month ago on July 19th and the power went out.  They were all pro during the power outage and handled it like pros. 
If you like steak, great drinks, wine, sides, and dessert; come here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff who know their product! If you get anything here please get the chocolate soufflé! OMG! I fell into a dessert coma for the night but now I crave it!!"}
{"text":"I am the woman who orders fish at a steakhouse because they always prepare it so damn well. Steaks leave me filling too full and I don't like that feeling.  I ordered the salmon which came on a bed of corn and black eyed peas with a side of sautéed spinach and button mushrooms. Sooo delicious.  My only negative is they charged me more for the housewine than they should have ($7 from the bar instead of the $11 they charged me). This was my first time at Morton's.  I wouldn't go back just because I frequent steakhouses very rarely."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars, but the bartender was just plain stupid!!  Eveything else was great!!  My wife ordered a Mojito from the cocktail server, when she brought them we noticed something wrong with them, they had no mint leaves in the drink. The cocktail waitress explained that they did not have the proper ingredients to make the drinks so the bartender us a mint flavored syrup. You can jus imagine how they tasted!!  Plus, charging us $14.00 each!! We sent those back!! Once we sat down, we had a great meal and the service was top notice."}
{"text":"Let's talk about service.  From the valet to the front desk, then to the robot waitress, very sweet but clueless.  Food was good.    Alot to be said about great service.  Go to Hugo Cellars.   
This just seems corporate.   Sad, it used to be great."}
{"text":"Great food and service but I just spent $200+ for a birthday dinner with my wife to sit next to some good ole boys in shorts and baseball caps. Really?  This Landry's member wont be back."}
{"text":"I made my first trip to Morton's last night and I felt like it was a mixed bag. 

My girlfriend and I started our dinner with the chilled Ocean Platter for two and it was delicious. It had a thorough sample of the various seafood options you typically find on a seafood menu and felt like good value for the price. 

For the main course, I ordered the porterhouse. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite tender. Unfortunately, it did not have the flavour I have come to expect from a well-cooked steak and I am still not sure why. The accompanying side dish of grilled asparagus with a balsamic sauce was rather nasty. The asparagus tasted like the grill and the balsamic sauce was clearly a poorly integrated afterthought. Furthermore, half of the stalks were not trimmed properly. My girlfriend had the salmon and said it was above average but I tasted it and found it to be nothing special.

The atmosphere of the place was old school and for my taste, far too stuffy. Some people might like the dim lights and waiters with bow ties but it is clearly not for me. I would likely not return to this restaurant and would suggest that the younger crowd could probably find a better alternative."}
{"text":"Went to Mortons on Valentines day. We had a 9:00pm reservation, seated around 9:20. I had the 12oz filet mignon, the girlfriend had the Salmon entree. Started with shrimp appetizer. It was large and very good. My steak was done exactly how I wanted it, but the rest of our food was quite bland. We split the mixed wild mushrooms, and the brussel sprout dish, but they were just completely unmemorable.
   Lots of food still served there, and we ended up taking stuff home, but only because of the starving children in Africa may need it, According to my mothers guilt trips.
   The staff were excellent, management did offer to replace our sides twice, but I wasn't expecting it would make any difference so we declined. It was a pleasant evening, but probably will stick with my favorite steak houses instead of trying here again. 
    They could probably greatly improve the valet situation out front. We were crowded in the ice cold front lobby that fits maybe 8 people, because you had to look for your car, they do not come in looking for you."}
{"text":"What a difference a year has made here.  Since Landry's has purchased Morton's, the menu has grown into many options for you to choose from.  The addition of the Mixed Grills, The 4 layer Chocolate Cake ( which is homemade), Shredded Steak tacos and a fantastic happy hour, how can you go wrong.  Service is still top notch and the new music adds to a less stuffy environment.  We celebrated a special occasion with some friends, and we were greeted with a personalized menu and an unexpected raspberry souffle.  Nice touch!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I found this steakhouse through a friend and have brought everyone I appreciate to this place since. It has a great chill atmosphere with awesome food (what else can you ask for?) please do try their prosciutto wrapped mozzarella and chicken Christopher, hands down the best combination ever."}
{"text":"The food was great, but no 4 star rating here due to the decor age.  Place is dark and feels like a 1970's establishment.  The steak, I ordered the Cajun ribeye was one of my best steaks ever.  The sides and bread was good and this place had a great wine selection.  Great location to dine and check out a professional sports game.  Valet service nice informative and professional."}
{"text":"Great steaks and martini's, one of this earth's ultimate combinations.

Having not been to a Morton's in awhile and continuing our ongoing quest for steakhouses across America, we settled on this Morton's only about 50 paces from the Ritz-Carlton front door.

With your usual steakhouse decor of wood, subdued lighting and dark colors we found it inviting from the start. Nothing peaks the taste buds before a good steak like an icy cold vodka martini and this one did not disappoint. A generous pour shaken with just a twist of lemon is just what 007 had in mind.

Steak wise, the \"Chicago\" style 24 oz. bone in rib-eye was cooked to perfection. A nicely marbled piece of meat correctly charred on the outside leaving a nice flavorful juicy medium-rare on the inside. This paired with a very decent Whitehall Lane cab and sides of creamed spinach and split baked potato rounded out a satisfying meal.  

While \"chains\" can sometimes become diluted and uneven, it's refreshing to see that Morton's still live up to their name and reputation. This one is worthy of repeat visits."}
{"text":"Mortons exemplifies class. from the moment you pull up you feel like you just came into some money. However, the food is doesn't add up to the ambience. For starters we had a 10 dollar blood mary that was awful. I make better ones at home at a fraction of the cost. I don't mind paying for something that is good. It wasn't. My steak was a very fatty and tough. I ordered the ribeye. I cook ribeyes at home on a weekly basis and for $6.99  my rib eyes are much better. Just saying.  If I am paying 20 some bucks for a steak, damn it, I want it to melt in my mouth. Sorry, but Flemings is much better and I wont be going back to Mortons."}
{"text":"Ok, it is a good steak, but not nearly the best I have had...that would be Cattleman's outside of ale Paso. And certainly do not feel we got what we paid for. We shared a meal and still paid over $200. Bartender was rude. We complained. Management was respectful of us and got us our cocktails herself and comped them. Not good enough for the money. Will not return."}
{"text":"I've been to most of the high end steakhouses in Toronto so I decided to check out Mortons to see how they compare. I must say that they are definitely up there. I had the Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Rib Eye cooked rare, which was excellently prepared. It was rare evenly all through out the steak. Got the Parmesan & Truffle Matchstick Fries and Creamed Spinach which were both rich in flavor. For dessert we got their Legendary Sundae which had a neat warm/cold combination. Prices are on the higher end but the quality is definitely there. Ambience and service were great too. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very expensive! However, long story short, you get what you pay for. Every thing my wife and I ordered from the crab cocktail to the steak to the dessert was perfection. Well worth coming back to for any occasion whether it be special or you just want that \"perfect steak\" meal."}
{"text":"3 friends and I went to Morton's for the National Filet Mignon Day where they serve $1 Petite Filet Mignon Sandwiches in the bar area. We waited for about 40 minutes for a table, and when we were finally \"seated\", we had to stand at a high top table because they had run out of chairs. The waiter was obviously busy and when he came over to get our drink order, we went ahead and gave him a standard order of 20 sandwiches for the table. He brought us our drinks and then left us to converse. Then we waited for our food.

20 minutes

40 minutes

AN HOUR.

We started noticing that other patrons were receiving their food when they had sat down well after us. One of the guys at our table tracked down the manager because... oh yeah... we hadn't seen our server since we sat down. If anything we wanted another round of beers.

Then the manager came over and gave us some less than thrilling news. The waiter NEVER PUT OUR ORDER IN. He simply forgot, and we had to listen to the manager ramble on incessantly about how crowded and busy they were and this should somehow make us understand. 

Side note: had the waiter written the order down, he wouldn't have forgotten! This is doubly important when the manager was falling over himself in a hungover stupor, pleading with us to see from their perspective that it's all okay because of how busy they were. 

Our food was rushed out and when we called for our checks, we expected the sandwiches to be taken off the bill (I mean it was $20 for 4 grown men) and he only took off 50%. That saved us each a whopping $2.50. Gee thanks grandma!

Then the cherry on top was that the server (or was the manager handling our table now?) didn't come collect our credit cards, so we had to walk the bill up to the bar so we could get out of that godforsaken place.

Final note: This was the first occasion I have ever left zero tip for service at a restaurant, but it simply was that bad. I will never go back, and we are telling all of our friends about our horrible experience.

Hey Morton's! 1) Write down orders so you don't forget. 2) Don't complain to the customers about how busy your restaurant is when you are providing a deal that is going to fill your bar area to capacity! WE DON'T CARE! It's your job to provide the service.

I wish I could leave a no star rating."}
{"text":"We ended up at Morton's for our anniversary dinner because Meat & Potatoes was overbooked and we didn't want to wait an hour for a table.  What a great decision!  The service was impeccable and the food was delicious.  Yes, it is expensive, but we were able to split an appetizer, soup, steak and vegetable dish for a reasonable price and didn't have room for dessert.  Their portions are certainly in-line with the price.

Their Lobster-bisque is basically heaven in a bowl.  Don't miss it!  And the Balsamic reduction on their asparagus was amazingly flavorful and clearly a true reduction and not one of those lousy corn-starch reductions most restaurants are using now.

On my way out I slipped (due to my own inability to walk!) and fell, and the response from the staff was very caring and immediate.  I was impressed from the moment I walked in until the moment I walked out."}
{"text":"summary...there are far too many fresh and innovative restaurants in cleveland to drop wads of cash on this mediocre steakhouse. $13 chop salad was below average at best. Seemed like my salad had been dressed then put in a cooler for an hour before serving. Chicago style signature 22 ounce bone in Ribeye for $57 no sides...just ok. Meat was bland but juicy and temp was off. Service was OK. Waiter not professional and felt like they were rushing us out the door. Had a stiff Manhattan which was my highlight. Wife had surf and turf with a sad looking little filet, three shrimp, and two bacon wrapped scallops for $49. $13 Brussel sprout side was good."}
{"text":"Read my Maestro's review and substitute the overpriced fish I mentioned for overpriced steak.  

It's meat - just lots of above average quality meat.  Sides are very basic and uninspired.

Again, expense account destination.  Not a place for foodies or vegans."}
{"text":"I would give this 5 stars but the waiter was not on top of his game maybe he was new. The waiters at the other tables around us gave a much better presentation then ours did.
The food was good but for the price it should have been Excellent!"}
{"text":"It's not what it used to be, we usually dine at the one in Beverly Hills or Los Angeles, and have been to this one a few times. Their so called PRIME porterhouse steak was swimming in Au jus and very soggy. Definitely not PRIME, not even choice. Great service, terrible meal."}
{"text":"Bar Review
The cosmopolitans are really tasty and a great portion.  My favorite item was the tuna tacos. This is a good happy hour overall but the atmosphere here is odd... not too happy. The servers were excellent and the happy hour items are unbeatable. Order anything you want but do not order mojitos, they are bad... really bad. Manhattan and Cosmopolitan are too good! I cannot wait to try their late happy hour soon."}
{"text":"The most consistent steak house in the united states. I travel a lot.. Have been to the one in Boston, New Jersey, Chicago, New York, Las Vegas, There is no question all the restaurants are all equally as good. Its a brand I trust.. I travel so much and always eat there when there is one in the town I am staying in. Great great place. Expensive but great!"}

{"text":"I joined Yelp and wanted to review this place after I went over Xmas.  Let me warn you that the price tag on the things at Morton's can be steep but it's not the most outrageous I've seen.  I came here early to celebrate my birthday and the place was pretty empty as it was a Tuesday or Wednesday.

They seated us immediately and our server came over to take a drink order from us.  We ordered a round of beers and had a look over the list.  We weren't sure how much food to order so we decided that we'd get an appetizer, each a steak and order 2 sides.

We ordered a shrimp appetizer, 2 NY strip steaks (medium rare), hash and spinach.  We ordered another beer of course!

Let me tell you the shrimp I had was FANTASTIC!  It was extremely delicious, cooked perfectly and that made me very excited to try the steak.  I mean if the shrimp appetizer was this good I was really looking forward to the main.  When the steak arrived I had a thought in my head that I made a mistake.  Maybe we ordered to much food?

I cut into it and I'm positive that was one of the 3 best steaks I've ever had!  The hash wasn't to good, I thought it was a little to crisp and dry.  I wasn't a fan of the spinach either so I decided to stay away from them and finish my steak first.  Well here's were things got difficult.  About 3/4 of the way through the meal I wasn't sure if I could finish the steak, it was just that filling but seeing how amazing the steak was I decided that I was going to let the sides sit.  After some struggling I finished the what was the most memorable steak I've had in quite sometime.  

I can't wait to come back here again and next time I'm going with 1 side between 2 people and I know not to get the 2 sides I ordered previously.

Thanks Morton's for a very nice night of dining.  Your staff is all class!"}
{"text":"We had our Quarterly Awards dinner here. The staff was amazing. They went above and beyond what was expected. The room was set up beautifully and the food was delicious. The steaks, chicken and fish were cooked to perfection and I do recommend the cream corn. Thanks to Diana our dinner went smoothly and everyone raved about it!!!"}
{"text":"Yawn.

I've eaten 2 meals at mortons and honestly - I can do better at home. Sure the food was good - but dropping $100+ dollars and not being thoroughly impressed isn't my idea of great value.

Save you're $ go buy a steak and a $20 bottle of wine at the Harris Teeter and fire up your grill - you'll pay 30 bucks and have just as good of a meal."}
{"text":"saying this place is very, very good is not giving it justice.  it is not as good as capital grille, but man is it close. again , bring 300 bucks, if you cannot afford it, don;'t go.  go to longhorns."}
{"text":"I'm a fan for Happy Hour.  There are better steak houses in Scottsdale/Phoenix for a sit down meal, but you can't beat the Bar Bites menu.  Their burger is one of the best in town.  I'm a big burger fan.  The best has to be Durant's in down town Phoenix.  Second best is Morton's followed by Capital Grill.  The burgers aren't cheap, but well worth it.

It would be nice if Morton's was open for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here for my Valentine's Day dinner and was blown away by the quality of both food and service. 

Thank goodness we made reservations two weeks prior otherwise we'd end up like the poor folks getting turned down by the hostess.. \"Sorry, the next available table is 10:45pm\"

Oddly, when we were seated in the dining area upstairs, there were plenty of empty tables. There were a around five more couples dining around us and the atmosphere was nice and quiet - Morton's certainly knows how to keep things romantic! They could have easily doubled their income for the night if all those tables were filled, but it would have been like a loud pub experience.

The filet mignon was pretty much the most tender I've ever tasted - everything about it was perfect. I've made up my mind that's what I'm ordering every time I visit Morton's! 

The Parmesan truffle matchstick fries were soooo delicious.. It was like eating crispy fat seasoned with the perfect amount of white truffle. 

We had the legendary hot chocolate cake for dessert. It was warm in the center and served with vanilla ice cream. I could have done without it - I didn't think it was too legendary. 

We gladly paid $25 for a Landry's membership card which would be credited back to our bill during our next visit. We're entitled to redeemable points and can be used at all Landry restaurants and locations. You also receive a $25 birthday reward, redeemable until the 15th of the month after.

Morton's, I will be back!"}
{"text":"All of there food is great. There filet mignon might be the best I have ever had. Linsey always makes the perfect drinks."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen. It pains me to update this restaurant and downgrade its rating. I recommended this place to a friend recently and I probably won't do this any more.

For Christmas, I received a gift card here. It had been awhile since I've been back, so this was all the motivation I needed to get down there.

They remodeled Morton's about a year ago, and update the entire look. Everything is clean and modern, and it's simply a very nice place. Great ambiance, and definitely an impressive atmosphere. They have more seating now.

The service is also outstanding. Everyone we interacted with was friendly, personable, knowledgeable and didn't sound rehearsed or uninterested in the answers to their questions.

The chopped spinach salad and chilled seafood platter were both very good. The latter being served with mayo, horseradish, and cocktail sauce.

The Baked Apple Sour was delicious, although some patrons have said it was too sweet. I could drink those all night!

There are two major problems with this restaurant. The first is that the steaks are simply not seasoned enough. This was exactly the problem last time. My wife's filet simply had no wow factor. My 16oz Cajun Ribeye, while trimmed perfectly, just had no flavor. I couldn't taste anything even close to Cajun. I also couldn't taste salt and pepper. It doesn't help that both steaks were overcooked, which seems a rarity in the steakhouse industry. I've been served many steaks UNDER but very few over.

This leads me to problem number two, the check, and this is simply where I have the largest issue. You can do better on your steaks AND better on your wallet by simply going someplace else. There are so many steakhouses spitting distance from Morton's in Pittsburgh: Capital Grille, Ruths Chris, and Eddie Merlots. For a full meal at Morton's, including a couple drinks a piece, you are looking at a solid $200 per person -- and I think that money is better off spent elsewhere. I'm not adverse to expensive meals --- but they better wow me. A couple of bland overdone steaks is simply not going to do the trick!

For what it's worth, we tried getting a reservation at Capital Grille for the same night, but they were fully booked, but Morton's had plenty of room. I'm sure Morton's seat twice as many people, but it looked relatively empty 6-8pm on a Saturday. You've got to ask yourself, \"Why are people going to CG instead?\""}
{"text":"The best in dining. Excellent food. Ambiance was elegant yet laid back. Service was fantastic. The server made us feel like we were old friends enjoying a meal together (ask for Ernie. ..kick ass service!). Finally,  it's vegas baby. You get lots of bang for your buck. Don't throw your money at the casinos,  spend a great evening here. Thanks mortons las vegas! (You too,  Ernie)."}
{"text":"A pretty good Morton's and your only option after the South Park location closed.  Located in the basement with lots of wood and leather.  Dinner in the bar area and the dining room a handful of times, and the service is stellar in both.  

Last time I went in though (05/12), they were playing pop music instead of the old standby's and it was really odd, kind of ruined the mood."}
{"text":"great stake as any other high end stake house, anything special ... I dint think so"}
{"text":"So I went to Morton's on a \"date night\" with my mom after a coworker gave her a gift certificate.  She had been there before and told me to prepare myself for probably the best meal I will ever eat.  And as much as I hate to admit this .....

......she was right.

Like other reviewers had stated, valet parking is a must unless you know of a perfect hidden gem of a parking lot.

The food.  Oh the food.  I was unsure what cut of steak to go with and my server recommended his favorite cut.  To be honest, I can't tell you what it was, but it was beautiful and perfectly cooked.  We ordered two sides to split.  The server told us that both of these are on their new menu which hadn't been printed yet by the time we were there.  One was a scalloped potato that was phenomenal.  But my favorite of the two sides was the creamed corn with tasso ham.  I was so enamored with it, I jotted down what was in it so I could try to replicate it at home!  Haven't tried to yet, and I'm sure my culinary prowess will get me CLOSE, but I would rather get it from Morton's.

For dessert I HAD to go with the molten lava cake which is apparently their best dessert and for just cause.  It was incredible!  If only I weren't so full on my sensational steak and sides (pardon the alliteration!), I could have finished it all.  

All in all, I WILL go back to Morton's, and I really really hope they have the creamed corn again!"}
{"text":"Show him how much you care... by buying him fancy meat.
 
Morton's is the perfect venue for a special dinner.  Food, service, and ambiance, this steak house has all the elements for a great night out.  

Morton's provided us with exceptional service throughout our entire experience with them.  When making a reservation over the phone, they were very friendly and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion.  They print off a menu with your name and date on it!  They make cute souvenirs (which I totally left on the table).

They are able to confirm your reservation via email and once you hang up the phone, the email has been sent.  Even though I changed the reservation two times, there's always another email reminder and no attitude.

Upon arrival the doormen greeted us with smiles and the hostess was very welcoming and apologetic that we had to wait a few minutes.

The ambiance is still slightly older due to the price point, but Morton's is not as stuffy and dark as some other high-end steak places I have been too.  The lighting is perfect and the dining room is still high energy and busy.

Once we were seated, the waiter gave us a detailed run-down of the new menu items and brought us bread.  It surprised me that the bread is almost like an onion loaf... and you have to cut yourself!  Also, there wasn't a separate butter knife, so you have to daintily slather whipped butter onto your jagged self-cut bread with a gigantic serrated blade.

For appetizers, we had the lobster cocktail and fried crab cake.  
The lobster cocktail isn't large (3 oz) but fresh and simple.  
The crab cake with pretty fantastic, crispy, and flavourful.

I had the mixed plate with a 6oz steak, 2 bacon wrapped scallops, and 3 medium sized shrimp.  Morton's version of surf and turf!

There are lots of sides to choose from, we ordered the sauteed spinach and mushrooms and the garlic mash.  Both great with our meals.  The mash had chunks of potato in it, so good!

There are some desserts that need to be ordered with your main because of preparation time.  The souffles are popular, but we wanted something with ice cream.  The chocolate lava cake topped with a vanilla scoop was perfect.  It was oozy in the middle and super decadent yummy.

I would have given Morton's 5 stars but I hate cutting my own bread! ...And one of the steaks was a bit overcooked.
The servers do ask if your steak was prepared as requested.
When we told the server it was overdone, they offered to make us a new one, but we declined and kept eating.
...A second server came by to ask us about our meal and steak and offered us a new one again.  We declined and continued eating.
.....One of the house managers came by to ask us about our meal and steak.  
........Another manager came by to ask us about our meal and steak.

They surprised us by taking $25 off the bill, which was a nice gesture.
It was a still a $300 dollar dinner (including a bottle of wine), but I appreciated all their efforts to bring us a new steak and the service was really top-notch.

Overall, it was a fantastic dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to return! =)"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly slow. The wait staff was okay, not the best I have had at a Morton's and the same goes for the food. Don't get me wrong, everything was good just not as good as say the Morton's in Portland."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour!  We wanted to take a walk and get some food and I remembered reading about the Power Hour on Yelp. So glad!  We got there right before it ended, so were able to score the iceberg wedge bites, mini fillet sandwiches, artichoke dip and some drinks.  What a deal!  I have always enjoyed my meals at Morton's and this was no exception.  The food was delicious and the service was perfect.  We were full, but left just enough room for the grand marnier souffle, which is straight from heaven.  The woman next to us said that she has them add a dash of amaretto to it when she gets it and it makes it even better.  Hard to believe it could get any better, but I am certainly going to give it a whirl next time!"}
{"text":"I went to Morton's with my parents last weekend while we were in Vegas and had a blast.  This is my dad's favorite restaurant and they didn't disappoint us even though I wanted to try other to trendy places like Cut or Craft.  Yes, I can be a sucker marketing and ambiance.  

Regardless of my bias, our waiter was cool, the food was just as delicious as a Cut, Craft or Boa.  Plus, we had fun and enjoyed leaving with a picture from the night.  The prices are a little high if you have alcohol with dinner, but we had a coupon for free desserts with each entree.  I noticed that they have a great happy hour to offset the dinner prices.

My favorite desserts in order from best to least favorite - key lime pie, hot chocolate cake and carrot cake.  Although the carrot cake was my least favorite, they were all great endings.  Now about the main course - the porterhouse was phenomenal, especially with the sauteed spinach, mushrooms and onions.  It's too bad they no longer have the mac' n cheese.  The sea bass that my dad had was flavorful, but I'm a bigger fan of red meat.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable, we were seated on a busy Saturday without a reservation. The second time, I did make a reservation and they were fine about moving it out since I was running late. Our server was friendly both times, with a great personality and very informative.

For an appetizer I ordered the shrimp cocktail and lobster cocktail. The shrimp was very large and even though it was pricey ($21 for five shrimp) I really enjoyed the freshness and quality. The lobster cocktail was good, but I personally prefer my lobster heated with butter. This was served cold, exactly the same way as the shrimp cocktail (with cocktail sauce).

 I ordered the largest fillet available (as usual) cooked medium. The meat was not seasoned properly, felt it could of benefited from a little salt. I could tell by looking at it when the server set it down in front of me it wasn't seared properly. In fact, it wasn't seared at all, it looked like it had been lightly sauteed. To make matters worse the steak was medium rare. I never complain or send my food back so I ate the thing and just complained to my companion. 

Second visit, I order the sea bass and I was very pleased. Served with capers, crab meat, diced tomato's in a nice sauce. I loved every bite of it, it was cooked to perfection. I did try my companions boneless strip, it was cooked properly, seared just right and very good cut of meat.  

We ordered the mac and cheese as a side (as usual) both times. It was described to have onions and bacon, which I thought would over power the side. On my first visit, it was divine. Second visit it was prepared with too much bacon and was completely over powered and there was a lot of grease as well. I didn't care for it and regretted not ordering the sour cream mashed potatoes instead. 

Desert was the biggest disappointment for me. You are required to order the chocolate souffle at the beginning of the meal, as it takes time to bake. I was already really stuffed by the time it came, but knew I'd make room. Unfortunately, it was not baked long enough and it was liquid in the middle. My date has never had souffle, I only had it once but I knew that I didn't order cake batter. The fact that my server didn't take it back or offer to take it off the bill was very unprofessional and I should have dinged her tip and didn't.

I don't think this place is as good as people say, or maybe it is just because I am spoiled. It's not bad, and if the casino gives me another $200 credit, I will be back. If not, I feel I can do better."}
{"text":"Not worth it for the price.  I could have had an amazing 5 to 7 course meal with multiple tastings for this cost.  I have buyers remorse.  If the food was amazing I might feel differently, but it was par to any other steakhouse.  If you are going to charge that much it should be the best steak I ever tasted.  The only good thing was we made reservations for a special occasion and they printed menus with the occasion on it and we got a picture taken and printed.  That was cute, but I should have been there for happy hour or just eaten a salad or bowl of soup.  I won't be back..."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been lucky enough to go here a few times. 
I think the service is wonderful. 

The food is great. The bread is my favorite, so crunchy and the taste is heavenly, love my carbs. My filet Mignon was like butter. The grilled asparagus yummy, the creamed spinach always great. And the cheesecake. A little bit of NY to end a great meal. 

We had a vegan with us as this was a graduation ceremony, they made her a vegetable platter with vegetables she chose. Pretty great for a steak place. 

I can only hope for more visits here."}
{"text":"Five star birthday tonight!  The phone lines are down, but I'm so glad that we persisted in coming. The service is exceptional. Everyone greeted me by name and helped to celebrate my big day. The crab cakes are exceptional!  The bone-in ribeye was succulent!  We will certainly be back. Big thank you to Daniel!"}
{"text":"Pros: the valet parking when it's freezing out!!! The hot chocolate cake was amazing. Steak wAs as well. Our waiter was personable. They customized the menus for our party since it was my boyfriends graduation celebration which was a very sweet touch.
Cons: our waiter was slow....and he only had two tables. I'm sure something was going on with his other tables. I got the shrimp scampi and it was at first amazing but there was so much garlic in the pasta that it made me feel sick."}
{"text":"Was disappointed in our recent visit to Morton's. The Steak was done to perfection, but we ordered a combo with Scallops and it like biting into a salt lick.  The Steak saved a star making it 3 but service was fair and a little disorganized.  For the price and what else is available in Toronto, we are bummed we wasted a dinner here. :-(."}
{"text":"Another great night out with my wife. Always love the ambiance of this place and had an amazing steak for two. Thanks Kevin for always taking such great care of us. We always appreciate the education on wine from the master sommelier. Also nice to meet Sammie the server. Very knowledgeable and nice"}
{"text":"First of all I would like to mention our waiter JUSTIN was amazing! He went above and beyond for me and my husband. We told him it was our first time at Morton's and he explained the menu to us very patient. The food was absolutely wonderful very tasty. Our stakes were cooked just how we asked which was very good. I can't rave any more about how amazing Justin was I'm sure he is one of the best there."}
{"text":"We went there the other night for a fiends birthday and everything about the visit was superb! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome. I ordered the New York Strip, Oscar style and it was delicious. The lobsters bisque was also very delicious. All in all this is the restaurant you want to go to if you want high-quality, delicious steaks."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent bartender and nice old fashioned appeal. Hit the tables afterwards!"}
{"text":"Attended a buzzcation event tonight at Morton's. The venue was great and the right size for the amount of attendees, the food was GREAT and the service was the best I have seen at an event of this size. They served endives with blue cheese, salmon pinwheels, filet sandwiches and a tomato brioche that was superb. I hope they re book here for another event - either way I am sure to go back."}
{"text":"Took the kids for a special occasion.  I like the remodel but still the service is lacking.  It just seems a bit relaxed and not in a professional great experience kind of way. The food is always good but again a little inconsistent.  We will go back. I will keep you informed if anything changes."}
{"text":"Great meal and nice bottle of wine. Had the 4 course local special. Nice filet and chocolate lava cake."}
{"text":"A friend and I paid a visit to Morton's for restaurant week in Pittsburgh for the winter. Usually when I go to restaurant weeks I don't expect the same quality if I came in any other week. I also am skeptical of how much I would enjoy expensive chain restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised when I came to Morton's. I thought everything was pretty good, so I think I want to try when it's not restaurant week to see how much better it is. 

Started off with a tuna tartar and it was delicious. The tuna and avocado with their sauce as a garnish was great. The tuna seemed very fresh. For my entree I opted for the steak. It was tender and not chewy at all. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and required no other sauces besides how it was prepared. My friend got the pork chop which was also very well cooked. I can't pick which I preferred more. For the sides the mash potatoes were great. Creamy and buttery. But the broccoli side I got was pretty lack luster. It stated bland and as if they just boiled it for a few minutes. I would not recommend unless bland is what you're going for. For dessert we got a chocolate mouse which was way too rich in my opinion. We could only have a few bites each before it got to be too much. Creme brûlée left a bit to the imagination. The caramelization on top was mediocre and the creme was a very faint in taste. Plating of the dishes seemed very minimal, but I'm not sure if it was because of restaurant week or not. If not, there is improvement to be had. 

I enjoyed the entrees and the appetizer so I struggled between a 3 and 4 but gave the higher score because of service. Even though it was busy we were well attended to."}
{"text":"Good food- not great. Excellent service. BYOW with a $30.00 corkage fee. I'll return."}
{"text":"The filet is so tender and delicious. The chocolate lava cake is a melt in your mouth dessert."}
{"text":"Service was great from start to finish. The only reason for lackluster experience was the food.  The hashbrowns tasted burnt and were lukewarm, the chicken Christopher was tasty and piping hot but they didnt flatten or tendorize the chicken. The filet was just average we didnt expect too much. Our party ended with a selection of desserts and while the red velvet cake and cheesecake with ice cream sounded great on the menu it wasnt a hit for us. They served the cake with a rock hard baseball sized scoop of ice cream.  It was a laughable way to end to the meal. Would I go back? Not by a long shot."}
{"text":"I travel frequently, work late, and don't always have time to make reservations before a late meal opportunity. We were greeted In an unwelcoming manner at 9pm at this Morton's. That along with waiting a solid 10 minutes before getting menus just made us feel even more \"rude\". The stuffy vibe needs to change for us to come back....Morton's is nice and convenient from the Ritz,  but i'd drive the extra few miles to City Hall next time.
The food was good although the Seafood platter - oysters, lobster, crab were below average compared to other Mortons. Steak is probably better in the desert."}
{"text":"This review is for bar area service only.  We had 2 servers...one blonde, one brunette.  The brunette was extremely courteous, attentive, and had a smile on her face.  The older blonde lady was very rude.  She scowled when we asked for our check.  She scowled when we asked for straws for our water.  She was very curt in her responses...definitely a lot of attitude.  The food wasn't even that great that night.  My trio of filet mignons arrived barely warm and they were not the best cut.  Disappointed in the food and the service was terrible.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Ok it was a special event ... this restaurant is above my pay grade ($300 for 3 people).

We started with chopped regular & spinach salad and lobster bisque.  All were good.

For dinner, we had 2 filets and the crab cakes.  My guests enjoyed their filets.  My crab cakes had very little filler ... and were very small.  We ordered the horseradish mashed potatoes (OMG GOOD) and spinach with mushrooms.

For dessert we had the double chocolate mousse and a spiked coffee.

Valet service ($9 available after 6) was prompt.  The hostess, waitress, and water boy were pleasant and knowledgeable.

It was a nice experience but the cost deters frequency."}
{"text":"Cant say I have ever had a bad Morton's dining trip or experience !!  Actually it is an experience but fair warning... there have been menu changes since Lowrys bought Morton's. I have always had the best service at Morton's and often bring guests, family visitors or business associates here. True, the cart with the meat and veggie presentation is \"no more\". 

This is a true \"Chicago\" style steak house with fair portion sizes. The sides are served family style. Cant say I am a big fan of the Macaroni and Cheese but it is back on the menu. The bacon topped Brussels sprouts are to die for !! 

Some locations have the steaks on display, be warned if you don't like to see meat !  This location displays the wines around the room and in a cooler in the back of the place as well. Our family enjoys sitting near the kitchen area to watch the prep but not near the kitchen doors. My reservation requests for times and booths have always been honored. 

Steak is always tasty but I have had a couple of times where it was under-cooked and sent back for more fire. The maitre d'  will arrange Morton's out of town dining if you are travelling. This was done for us for our Las Vegas trip last year 2011 and again this year 2012. 

Deserts range from rich chocolate cake, apple pies, ice creams to various berry dishes with heavy Italian desert cream and if you ask at the start of the meal , a hot lava chocolate cake can be prepared."}
{"text":"Outstanding, full service steak house located just minutes off the strip. 

Take the 5 minute cab ride from any Hotel on the strip to Mortons and have a wonderful dinner. 

The service is top notch, as is the steak, chops, and seafood. They have a large selection of steaks as well as many sides to choose from.  They start you off with that signature Mortons hot loaf of bread....how great is the Mortons bread and fresh butter!  Be warned, it's easy to do so don't fill up on the bread! :)

They have a full bar with an extensive wine collection, with many wines by the glass. 

The staff go out of their way to make you a great dinner and a wonderful experience. Reservations are highly recommended!  

Mortons is outstanding. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced for very mediocre food.  I ordered the crab cakes ($36) and got 2 golf ball sized cakes that were seared with a crunchy crust on both sides.  Who wants crunchy, almost burnt crab cakes?  I want my crab cakes to be soft.  The crab cakes at it's sister restaurant, The Grand Concourse, are much better.  My husband ordered a steak ($60+), and said it was okay; nothing to write home about.  He prefers a steak with more marbling.  He also had the crab bisque ($15) and said he had better elsewhere.  I tasted it as well, and thought it was bland.  The best part of the meal was the dessert, the chocolate lava cake ($15).  But, to be perfectly honest, the lava cake at Applebee's is better.  I'm not a food snob.  The ambience and service were very good, however.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Boy, has Morton's changed over the years.  It used to be one of THE classiest  steakhouses in Cleveland.  Not anymore.  Before, you could always count on exceptional service, a great atmosphere and yes, high prices.  Today, you can count on only the high prices.

We had reservations for 6:30 and needed to wait for a host.  The restaurant was maybe 10% full.  Our server was a bit scatter-brained and not professional as our past experiences

Overall, the food quality was good.  The NY strip steak was fine. But at $58 for just the entree, it was not that great.  We ordered the Lyonnaise potatoes to share and they were exceptional although Morton's has really down-sized their portions.  I remember it the past, if you ordered a side, you could share it with 3 or 4 people.  Now it was not enough for 2.

Morton's must have thrown out their dress code policy as we saw a number of customers in shorts and flip flops.   This \"relaxed\" dress code really subtracts from the overall feeling of the restaurant. 

My wife ordered one of Morton's signature \"hand-crafted\" drinks.  She chose the Cadillac  Margarita.  The bartender definitely forgot at least one of the ingredients.  The server replaced it with another from the \"other\" bartender saying this one should be better.  You would think both bartenders should be able to make their signature drinks.  Anyway, the drink was better but not memorable.  The reason I wanted to post this review was the beer my wife ordered.  She chose a Belgium Trappist beer named Orval.  The server came over with the beer and literally dumped it into the glass.  Foam quickly rose overflowing onto the table cloth and quickly without saying a word walked away.  I took a picture of it and will see if I can post it here.  Oh, and did I mention the beer (regular sized) cost $16.  You would think the servers would be trained on how to pour a beer!

Our bill came to (before tip) $185 which included the strip steak, a fish special, one side potato to share, two martinis,  one margarita, and one beer.  We used to go to Morton's for special occasions but not anymore."}
{"text":"We went for an amazing dinner last night.  Wonderful as always!  This was where my husband took me on our first date a million years ago and they have continued to be perhaps our favorite go to special occasion dinner spot.  Last night was a birthday celebration, and once again they did not disappoint!  Service is always impeccable, food is consistently amazing.  I think about the lobster bisque all year awaiting our return!  Thank you for the wonderful food and service! Kudos to all the staff!  Your consistency in providing exceptional experiences is greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere of morton's. I loved that they printed unexpectedly Happy Birthday on the menu for the person I took out on their birthday. The staeks are great i would recommend the porterhouse cut. The chocolate lava cake is the best!"}
{"text":"Everytime I think about Morton's steakhouse, I am reminded of that warm, crispy on outside, soft and flaky inside yummmy onion bread!! 
We were greeted warmly by the hostess who had us promptly seated. While we were browsing thru the menu, comes the amazing bread with butter!! 

We started with their chopped salad served perfectly chilled, with cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, feta cheese and finely chopped eggs. Sooo good! 

My kids shared filet mignon which was great. Hubby loved the miso sea bass.

For sides I highly recommend creamed corn which has the most tender sweet corn and their Parmesan and truffle matchstick fries. They are not shy adding truffle to those fries!! Loved it!

I am happy that we were not charged extra for splitting our salad and filet. 

Wine selection was great and their somm is one of the friendliest in town. 

For dessert we had Morton's legendary hot chocolate cake, probably the best lava cake in Vegas! You need to order this 20 mins ahead of time. Our waitress was wonderful about letting us know that."}
{"text":"I usually go to Morton's for quality of food and service. The quality of food is still there that's why I gave it two stars.  However, the service was terrible.  Jane was our server.  When she took our orders she ran off like a bat out of hell without answering questions we had. We had to flag her down like a taxicab to get her back to answer a question. We hadn't finished asking our questions when she ran off again. Did she have to pee, perhaps?  We summoned her again with another question but she didn't come by. We got that answered by another server.  It seems that they work in teams so you don't really get the personal attention required in a place like this.  It's like McDonald's. One person gets your fries, the other the burger, the other gets your drink. Not good.  While we were having dinner Jane asked: ARE YOU HAPPY? ( With respect to what? ) I think most appropriately it would be: IS EVERYTHING OK? or ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR MEAL? or IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE I CAN GET FOR YOU?  Like perhaps a few extra lemons slices with my shrimp that came with one lousy slice of lemon?  The guy filling the water glasses had water fall all over  my husband shirt cuffs.  Apology? Nope. 
People shouldn't pay two hundred dollars for this kind of service.  Too bad. Another quality restaurant bites the dust."}
{"text":"The queen of the bloated corporate steakhouses!  Save your money.....find a local street vendor.....and buy tickets to whatever is at the Blumenthal!!"}
{"text":"First off, I need to express that this place had some of the best service ever and this 1 star is for the food alone (as well as the prices [even if it was gifted, if I had to pay I would cry] - yikes). I believe that a restaurant has to have good food and good service for me to be a repeat customer and this place is a big DO NOT WANT for me as far as the food goes. 

Went here last night with a big party for my boyfriend's cousin's graduation. I noticed quickly that only the sides were vegetarian (obviously, this is a steak house) but after talking to the waiter he said that they could make a vegetable plate for me. I had high hopes since the last time this happened at Todd's who also lacked vegetarian entrees, and the food was spectacular. I also thought that since this place was as pricey as it was, anything I put in my mouth would be orgasmic. Unfortunately every single thing was bland as all get-out. 

First off, I tried the bread which looked great but they do not provide proper bread knives so the big fluffy bread ended up being smushed. It was also ridiculously flaky making a big mess and just didn't taste that great. 

My vegetable plate came and that's exactly what it was. It was literally giant vegetables just steamed - no herbs, no flavor, no spices - nothing. Totally disappointing. There was broccoli, a halved tomato, asparagus, cooked spinach, and portobello mushrooms which was the best part as those kind of mushrooms pack a lot of flavor by themselves. It was a huge plate but there was no punch. 

I tried some of the sides, the panko-encrusted onion rings and the mashed potatoes. Both were also almost flavorless but still kind of decent, but no way were they worth $10 each. Absolutely ridiculous pricing for something so very plain. 

The boyfriend and I shared a chocolate souffle for dessert which looked great but was kind of disgusting. It was a hot chocolate sludgy mess. The best part was the cream on the side. Not something I would order again. 

I was very disappointed with this restaurant. The absolutely impeccable service however could not make up for the awful food. The meat eaters at the table seemed happy with what they received but I was just in awe at how bland everything was. 

Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Pricing: 1/5 (just... yikes.. when my boyfriend said it was $43 for his itty bitty filet mignon I almost choked)
Food: 0/5 

I really, really wanted to give this place a chance but if you're a vegetarian who has taste buds, stay far, far away."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad but it wasn't worth the $225 price tag. The steak didn't come out as ordered but when our waitress took it back to the cooks it took appropriately 15 minutes to get my steak back corrected. At other restaurants I haven't had to wait that long. Nothing really wowed us about the food. Our waitress was ok but didn't bother to ask if we wanted dessert before handing us the check. The atmosphere is really neat though."}
{"text":"Power Hour is great on Fri-Sat and Happy Hour Sun-Thur, such great food, Kanji the bartender is excellent, hospitality so amazing second to none, love coming here, Highly Recommend Morton's to everyone"}
{"text":"In the words of my father this restaurant is first class all the way! From the valet service to dessert everything was fantastic-you of course are paying for it.  It was a wintery night and $9 for valet parking was fine by us.  The valet was very concerned about my heels getting caught in the grates on the sidewalk! We used Opentable to make reservations although it wasn't as crowded as I expected for a Saturday night. We were seated right away at a side booth which was perfect for two. Our waiter was fantastic and I started off with one of the specialty cocktails and my date ordered red wine. The drinks are pricey so beware-$15 each for the glass of nothing fancy red wine and the specialty cocktails are also $15 each.  It was Pittsburgh restaurant week so I went with the $35 3 course meal which I thought was a fantastic deal.  You had your choice of any salad. I went with the cob salad which was a smaller portion but just right for me. With 4 entrees to choose from I went with the 6 oz filet and mashed potatoes (choice of one side).  They were both fantastic. I ordered the chocolate moose for dessert thinking it was cake rather than a small bowl of rich dark chocolate moose but it was still pretty good. My date went with the $59.99 3 course option that included seafood. I believe they have this option anytime.  He started out with a full size caesar salad which included very tasty homemade croutons. Along with the 6 oz filet you also were able to choose a seafood side. He went with the bacon wrapped scallops (they give you 2 huge ones) and baked potato for his side. What I loved about the baked potato option is they bring out a topping bars complete with butter, sour cream and bacon.  For dessert he went with the chocolate molten cake with a side of vanilla ice cream which was to die for!!  Overall one of the best meals I have had in a while!"}
{"text":"We started with the lobster bisque and jumbo lump crab as appetizers. The bisque was lumpy and average. The crab however was fresh and delicious. 

For the main course we opted for 2 Porterhouse steaks (cooked medium) as the perfect cut for those who cannot decide between a NY strip and a filet. Accompanying the meal we chose steak cut fries and asparagus. 

The meal paired well with the wine the Sommelier recommended and the sides were great. The NY strip portion of the meat was tasty however the filet side was tough and overcooked - certainly not medium as ordered. A steak house (by name) that can't cook a steak to order is not worthy of anything over 2 stars - it's an entry level requirement. In fairness we did not mention this to the server, as the end result would have been two new steaks which would have taken more time and been a terrible waste of meat.

The overall experience of our evening was very enjoyable. However when paying top dollar for a steak ($49 a piece) you expect it to be cooked as ordered.

On the way out 5 staff were gathered around the hostess. They all wished us a good evening however were too engaged in conversation with each other to think about helping us with the two heavy doors. 

Overall, Mortons is a good restaurant however it's increasingly dated, overpriced and running on the success of yesteryear. We've had better steaks and service for less - the filet at Bandaras in Old town is one local example."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a party of 9 for Christmas Eve dinner. It was my second time dining at a Morton restaurant and I have to say it didn't disappoint at all. The house salad had a great mixture of flavors and the steak was cooked to a perfect medium, just the way I love it. The Parmesan and Truffle fries is a must try, best fries I've ever had!!! They are cut super thin and the flavour is to die for. We also got the chocolate lava cake and creme brûlée for dessert, both were yum but I was too full to enjoy them properly. 

Overall, another great experience at Morton. Will definitely revisit again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as is all the Morton's Steakhouses. Maurice, our waiter, was terrific. The food is reasonably priced for a Morton's. I think because it was slow that night our portions were significantly larger. The baked potato could have passed for a football."}
{"text":"Ate Valentines dinner there last night and had a lovely filet with crab and asparagus on top. At the last minute I called and asked for two more to join us and they said great. Best meal I've had in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Still My favorite place. Huge steaks at a huge price. But with that huge service who cares. I have eaten at 25 location thus far. I want to go international. The classic Filet with bernaise is my favorite and the godiva cake. I am hungry..."}
{"text":"The food is your classic steakhouse fare. You know you'll get great meat at a place like this, and our meal was no exception. But other reviewers have written about that, so I'll focus on what made our dinner.

Our waiter was exceptional. Hands down, the best waiter I have had in Charlotte. When I go back, I'll be asking for him by name: David Brown. We had some picky food orders that I wasn't sure the kitchen would accommodate, and he went above and beyond to see that we were satisfied. That makes for good service. He did a fantastic job gauging the tone of our dinner and pitched his service just right. It is that indefinable quality which makes for GREAT service.

And our waiter didn't seem to be an exception. The maître d' was charming, and the other waiters and waitresses that we interacted with were as well. The food is pretty good, but it's the sum of the experience that will bring us back."}
{"text":"I sincerely despise giving such low stars to such an esteemed establishment, but as I was pondering on the rating, \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is exactly how I felt about my visit to Mortons. 

It was around six on a Monday evening and it was almost completely empty other than two or three tables, and it still took a very long time for someone to come to us. We opted for bar seating, and happy hour but asked for a regular menu as well. We alternated between two servers, who were not extremely busy yet took a long time to take our order, bring the food, and check up on us. 

The Filet Trio was seriously underwhelming, none of the sauces were good, and the filet was definitely not the tender cut of beef I'm accustomed to, it was hard and difficult to cut in to even though we ordered it medium rare. The caeser salad is good, very fresh and crisp lettuce, however completely drenched in dressing. The french onion soup, had a strange consistency, not even like soup but tasted fine. My girl friend ordered a few other small plates that I wasn't interested in trying but she said they were okay. 

For a restaurant of this caliber, I dont know, I just expected....more."}
{"text":"Since I'm on a chain review bender today, I need to add Morton's. I love Morton's, always will, and I have no doubt it will always be 5 stars for me. Yeah it's expensive, yeah it can be stuffy, but I don't care...the food is so PURE, that I will be a customer for life (ha). They've got some cheap eats in the bar and a nice TV area to watch some games too over a $15 martini :) 

The Filet is awesome, as are the button mushrooms, which I had on my recent visit. The souffles are awesome and it's the best molten lava cake in town. Oh Morton's how I love thee :)"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for our anniversary. The customer service at this place phenomenal. The greeted us with excitement and even said \"Happy Anniversary\" as we entered. The waiter we had explained the full on menu and was so nice when my wife kept changing her mind. Afterwards, they treated us to a dessert for the occasion. I must say, my wife and I might make this our every year anniversary."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here everyday. Where to begin, between the great customer service and the amazing delicious food. You can't go wrong. My favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. It has this old school vibe, like the movie casino. The setting and dim lighting is very romantic. I made a reservation online for my boyfriends birthday, upon receiving our menu it had a special announcement on the menu saying Happy Birthday with his name on it. The service was exceptionally great, our waiter was very knowledgeable and kind. We ordered scallops as an appetizer, they were to die for. Between the Chilean sea bass and the steak you can't go wrong. Every taste is so rich in flavor, the steak is very juicy and prepared like I asked. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Filet Trio is the Ultimate!  Nice cozy atmosphere great service and delicious bites! Prime burger bites are amazing"}
{"text":"Came to Morton's for restaurant week. The price was $50.13 per person and they had a special menu where you could pick between a couple different things. We started out with a large loaf of onion bread. The bread wasn't bad but I could only eat so much. Next came the French onion soup. I could have picked up and drank it in 3 gulps it was so small. The soup had a very bland flavor. Then my steak and sides came. The filet was cooked the way I asked and didn't taste bad but certainly isn't worth what they are charging. I have had better steak at high end steakhouses on the strip. The sides I shared with my wife, we had the sour cream mashed potatoes and lyonnaise potatoes. The mashed was not bad but the lyonnaise potaotes were just gross. The onions were very overcooked and chewy. The potatoes weren't at all what my wife showed me in other pictures on yelp. Then came dessert. I chose the strawberry cheesecake and it couldn't have been anymore flavorless. The portions for restaurant week were way smaller then if you just came in and ordered from their regular menu which is a scam to me. The food just wasn't good and a waste of money.

Our server was very good. He checked on us often. One of the servers mentioned that Morton's was undergoing a remodel and said we were lucky to be seated in a booth in the corner because then we wouldn't be bothered by dust like some other customers. You should never ever talk about that with people about to eat in your restaurant.  

The parking sucks. The front of the restaurant is reserved for valet only. All other patrons must park behind the restaurant and walk around. Not very classy."}
{"text":"Girls pampering trip to Vegas started with Morton's this past weekend.   For $90.00 per person I was very disappointed!  The steak was very good but everything else was nothing to write home about.  The service wasn't great and I was actually surprised at how the staff wasn't more engaging.  Our reservations were for 6:30pm so they weren't busy yet.  The waiter seemed a little put out that we didn't order drinks. But even the water server was looking behind us when pouring our water. We did have the manager ask how our steaks were and he was the only one that seemed truly engaging.  The waiter became friendlier towards the end which I'm sure was for his tip.  We went for our car and I asked the Valet for change of a $20.  He went in to the bar and came out with 4 $5 dollar bills and said they didn't have change smaller than a $5.  I felt that most of the staff was nice only when they had to be.  I found them to be quite arrogant and entitled.  Needless to say I ended up sick before we even got back to the hotel and spent the next 2 hours ill.  After reflecting on it all weekend I realized that what bothered me so much was I had never felt so invisible.  And how crazy it was that it came from people who's primary job it was to serve us. So sorry I tipped 25%."}
{"text":"We went a couple of years ago.  The food was ok, but the waiter was rude.  That is why I gave this a single star.  I will give it another chance eventually."}
{"text":"I'm glad i came in to try this spot for HH before making reservations for a nice dinner date. I expected high prices, but the quality doesn't back it up at all. Everything is about $3-4 more than it should be, and other than dessert, nothing impressed.

The Filet Mignon sandwiches from the appetizer menu (regularly 4/$16) have good quality meat but very little of the mustard-mayo and thus little moisture. Ask for Dijon on the side. The Crabcake BLT sliders ($17?) were a hit though, would get them again if we came back. 

The Caesar Salad ($13) is huge, but oddly doesn't come with anchovies unless you specifically ask for them, which we found bizarre. The $15 Baked Five Onion soup was packed with onions, but the broth lacked depth and frankly the portion was worth half the price. Literally every other French onion soup I've had in Vegas (including on the Strip) has been cheaper and better than this one, and usually larger. 

But Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake ($15)? It's legit legendary, probably the best lava style cake I've ever had- liquid milk chocolate center, lightly floured exterior with raspberries for presentation, served with a scoop of ice cream. Plating this on a long, flat rectangular platter was an odd choice that made it difficult to eat the ice cream. 

The service was okay, but the high prices weren't justified and frankly, blocking off a third of the parking lot for valet when your dining room is mostly empty is a turn off. Maybe they have great steaks, but I don't really care to find out."}
{"text":"The service is phenomenal and the food is great. I would highly recommend this recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic steak"}
{"text":"Great place for date night or any other special occasion.

Morton's without a doubt is my favorite upscale Pittsburgh steakhouse. The service is impeccable and the food is second to none.

During this visit I took my wife for a romantic dinner for Valentine's Day. We were early for our reservation so we headed to the bar for some \"Bar Bites until it was time to be seated at our booth. Once seated Ed was our server and he was great! He brought over the \"meat cart\" with all of the different cuts of steak that they offered and went over each steak. The cart also has all of the vegetables they offer as well.

We both started off with a few cocktails. I had the French Raspberry Mortini and she had the Chocolatini Mortini. By this time the huge loaf of onion bread was brought and placed on our table. Next we both had salads. I had the Caesar and she had the Wedge. For our steaks we both had the single cut fillet cooked Cajun Style which were seasoned and cooked to perfection. Absolutely the best, most tender steak I have ever eaten in my life. It was like steak flavored butter. It melted in your mouth. I added a utterly amazing crab cake to mine and she added colossal shrimp to hers. To accompany our entrees I added garlic mashed potatoes to mine and the wife added green beans to hers.

For dessert we shared the world famous Morton's Lava Chocolate cake with ice cream. What a way to end one of the best meals we have ever had."}
{"text":"Had our anniversary dinner here as we have the past few years.  Great service as always.  It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night...the remodel was nice.  Glad to see they kept it \"old school\".  We ordered the beefsteak tomatoes with blue cheese to start. Very good!  I ordered my usual entree, the petite fillet.  Not as good, as it was seasoned weird and no sear.  Hubby said I should have sent it back, after all it was a $45 piece of meat!  The truffle matchstick fries were awesome!  The carrot cake for dessert was .  Morton's still is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"I am giving this 4 stars because of the whole experience. Awesome! 
I give two stars to our server...was to intense for the atmosphere.
The Hostess, Management treated us very special.   
When the server approached us, he didn't give us his name. He asked us for our drinks then disappeared. When he took our order I felt like we were at in a sit down deli vs. a high class restaurant. He served us our salads but did not ask us if we wanted fresh ground pepper & when he cleared our plates away he got a little irritated the moment I moved my glass. He sometimes gave us funny looks whenever we made a minimal request. Seriously? 

Being a former fine dining server myself I know what I could & could not do. 

The ambiance, food & wine were exceptional but I will be very choosy on who will be serving us next time."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. We couldn't have asked for anything more. Warm, pleasant, yet professional greeting, and seated immediately. Decor and atmosphere were very high end. But none of the staff was pretentious. Food was perfect. Sea bass was the best I've ever had. My wife said her fillet was delicious. Our sides were incredibly tasty. I can't imagine wanting anything better. They had a extensive wine list. Our waiter was friendly, but not familiar, and very attentive. Morton's is outstanding."}
{"text":"After receiving an e-mail a few weeks ago about a Halloween special menu I made reservations for dinner.  Upon arriving we were seated immediately and then waited and waited , yet the restaurant was half full.  Finally our server appeared.  When I asked for the Halloween special    menu, at first, she appeared to not know what I was talking about.  Finally she admitted there were a few specials but said that there was nothing written down.  She proceeded to tell us what the special menu was.  It was difficult to understand her as the music was very loud and English was not her first language.  Finally after repeating it several times for us it was not what I had read so I pulled out my phone and brought the menu up so the other members of our party could read it.  How difficult is it to print off a special menu, unless you don't want customers to know about it.  It took forever to get out wine, while she kept asking us if we wanted to order.  Finally the wine came and we ordered.  Two in our party ordered the filets and said they were \"fair\".  I had the Chicken Christopher and although it was good, it had a large amount of garlic, which masked the chicken taste and was a very large portion.  All in all, our meal was rather lackluster, which is not what one would expect for two hundred dollars.  The service was average at best.  Immediately after signing the check I saw a hand come across in front of my face and the server's hand snatch up the check -something I find inexcusably rude in any restaurant - especially a place such as Morton's.  I guess checking the amount of the tip I left was more important than manners.  On the way out I mentioned it to a guy standing at the front desk when he asked how our meal was and he said \"Give me more details\" which I tried to do but he was too busy looking at the computer screen in front of him and he never asked who the server was.  Obviously he did not care.  

I have never been a big fan of Morton's but have always left the door open as restaurants do improve, this is a beautiful restaurant and located very close to our home, however, the door is now shut and I will never return nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Salmon is amazing.   Sides were out of this world.  Service was top notch.   What can I say, the prices are very reasonable for the caliber of food and service."}
{"text":"Great looking menu, ambiance felt old/outdated but the food and service was excellent. I'd have to say I preferred the steak here than at Jacobs. Had the 24oz porterhouse cooked perfectly medium rare, flavourful and juicy. We also had the crab cakes which were filled with plump sweet crab meat, and not a lot of filler. Sides were spinach and mushrooms. 

Will have to come back to try some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing visit to Morton's. There are many better steakhouses and restaurants in Cleveland to put up with this lackluster food and service.
I went on Valentine's Day with advance reservations and told the maître d' when we checked in and the woman who took my reservation that we were celebrating a special occasion. We were seated in the back room instead of the main dining room even though the main dining room was quite empty when we arrived. Unfortunately the customers in this room were poorly dressed in jeans and T-shirts and jeans jackets and were apparently friends of the waitstaff who stood around and talked to them about the miserable conditions of their job and other gossip during most of their meal.
The food was the best slightly above average. The drinks ( an old-fashioned and a French 75) were ok but not WOW. The bottle of wine was worth the high price.
When I had visited Morton's in other cities for a birthday dinner they would fuss over us, take a picture, and even comp of dessert on occasion. This visit there is little of that and the weather was often hard to find. He said there will be two other people assisting him during the meal and they never appeared.
The bill for the two of us exceeded $300. When I was leaving the hostess at the main stand asked how our meal was and I said it was disappointing and much worse than an earlier visit. She called the nearby manager and said \"oh oh\" and related my comment. His response was to give me his business card and said I should ask for him next time I came in. I doubt if I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This is a GORGEOUS Morton's. One of my favorites. The layout is beautiful. I loved the bar and the booths. The lighting is perfectly dimmed. I ordered the steak and lobster special and ordered my steak medium well. I also ordered the mashed cauliflower. When I got my steak it was medium rare and cold :(
Not a problem! They immediately fixed it, took it off of the check, and gave us and extra cauliflower dish! THAT is great service. And all with a smile. They do not disappoint! I will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal with top notch service."}
{"text":"Wonderful, food and always the best service! 

I had the \"Mixed\" entree with Filet Mignon with shrimp and stuffed shrimp, 2 sides creamed corn and sour cream mashed potatoes! Everything was SUPER tasty! 
The waiter was a nice guy! 
My water cup stayed full, the original \"guy\" hostess pulled the table out to seat us.. It was overall just a GREAT experience! 
Ambience = 5/5
Service = 5/5
Food = 5/5"}
{"text":"Steak... it's what's for dinner.  If I utter those words, my husband is on board! 

It was Restaurant Week which was a great time to try Mortons.  The parking lot is mainly valet, which is complimentary.  If you would rather park yourself, there is plenty of spots on the opposite side of valet.  We had reservations and were kindly seated quickly.   

To begin an onion bread loaf is brought for the table.  If you're on a date, I wouldn't eat too much so you don't have onion breath all night.  Married couples - dig in! 

I started off with the Caesar Salad.  It's a nice starter size with fresh shaved parmesan.  For my main attraction I chose the Shrimp Alexander.  The plate had 6 good sized pieces which had a light panko coating with a bread stuffing center.  The dish had great seasoning so I had to share!  It was plenty for a filling meal.  

With the restaurant week menu, a choice of dessert comes with it.  I opted for the cheesecake.  Now I was expecting a regular NY Cheesecake slice.  I was pleasantly surprised with the caramelized sugar coat on top.  It was almost like they crossed Creme Brûlée and Cheesecake.  It's a match made in heaven.  

What was off was the service. I think our waiter was having a bad day.  I had to ask him twice for the Restaurant Week menu.  For some reason he didn't seem happy about giving it to me.  The rest of the evening he was short in responses with almost an indifferent attitude.  

Aside from the strange service, I enjoyed the meal very much.  I hope to return to a more welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Mortons steak house is by far one of the best steaks I have had!!! I had the chicken and it was very tasty!!! I also tried my brothers steak and it  as great too!!! I like how they present the food and then let you select based on the cuts of the meat, fish and chicken!! We also tried the dessert and it was amazing!!! Their creme brûlée was sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"2012 Fall Restaurant Week Dinner #1

It's on the corner of E Flamingo & Paradise. I've never dined at a Morton's. I took Restaurant Week as the perfect opportunity to try these \"never been\" places. Not that I need a good reason to eat out... ;)

$50.12/person. Three courses.

What did we order?

1st Course
Baked Onion Soup
Chopped House Salad

2nd Course
6oz Double Cut Prime Pork Chop
8oz Filet Mignon ($5 upcharge)

Accompaniments
Horse Radish Mashed Potatoes
Grilled Jumbo Asparagus

3rd Course
Creme Brulee
Chocolate Mousse

My boyfriend didn't care for the soup, but I thought it was quite tasty. The chopped salad wasn't made well, the bleu cheese was in big chunks, so some bites you got none, other bites you got a big glob. Don't get me wrong, I love bleu cheese. It should be sprinkled on salad, right?!

It was the first time I had horseradish mashed potatoes. It was good, but I think my tongue was waiting for garlic, which I used to. My boyfriend brought home the leftover, so there you go. Worth eating again. Lol..

I'm happy to say the stars of the meal were the meats, as it should be at a place like Morton's. Both medium-rare, they were cooked to perfection and oh so tender. Slightly seasoned to give that great crust on the outside. Yum! They offered a Bearnaise sauce with the filet mignon, but as a steak should be, it was delicious just as is. I enjoy ordering pork chops, I learned that only great steakhouses make it right, since pork is so prone to becoming dry if not cooked correctly. Morton's pork chop was very good.

We both enjoyed the desserts. The creme brulee had the perfect caramelized crunchy sweet top you love to crack open. The chocolate mousse was unusually thicker than most mousses, but my boyfriend devoured it still. 

It was a good dinner. Attentive service. It's been a while since I ate at a steakhouse where a maitre d lead you to your table. Want to give 4 stars but something is stopping me. Maybe I've been a bit spoiled dining at such great steakhouses here in Vegas, Prime, SW, etc.

I'll try to be a Morton's fan next time around..."}
{"text":"We were staying at a nearby hotel and walked to Mortons to get dinner for my mother.  She loved everything and said it was the best steak she had ever had.  An hour later the front desk called our room and said someone from the steakhouse had dropped off a bag at the desk for me.  They had forgot moms salad and he had walked it to the hotel and added chocolate cake as An apology.  I loved  the service."}
{"text":"Came here for the partner's birthday and we had a really wonderful evening. The staff was really nice and our waitress was the perfect blend of friendly, funny, and attentive. We both had lobster and filet mignon, split the steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes, and then ended the meal with a chocolate souffle and creme brulee. (So, really, as stereotypical as you can possibly get with a steakhouse dinner.) 

The steak and lobster were prepared very expertly. the broccoli was only so-so, and the souffle was definitely undercooked and a bit gooey. I REALLY wished they had bruleed the brulee before it was sent out so it had been freshly put together, but it was good none the less. All in all, it was still a very classic steakhouse, and we had a great evening."}
{"text":"Delicious cuts of steak, but expensive.  Great service. Calming upscale ambiance.  Impressive menu. Well-cooked per preference."}
{"text":"We brought some C Level Executives that came to valley for a business meeting to Mortons last night. Our reservations was at 6:00pm. We were immediately seated which is great. We waited...and waited...and waited until my co-worker got up and asked another server to send our server over to the table. The server was put off by us asking her of the specials and rather than telling them to us, she guided us to a piece of paper. Now, we are all capable of reading but we are somewhat paying for impeccable service so she should KNOW the specials for starters and if she doesn't she can find a way to explain them as opposed to just throwing a piece of paper in front of us and then asking us if we \"wanted to order\". For an average of $100 a person to dine and have some beverages here, I expect FAR BETTER service. We had to hunt the server down on numerous occasions and NOT because we were being needy but because she simply did not make herself present in any way. The manager did come over to do his standard table touch but it was as if it was part of a routine, not like he really cared. I will say the food was good....But not great. 

We host an average of 4 business dinners a month with high level executives and this is the first and LAST time we will be bringing them to this \"high end\" steakhouse. Very very disappointing and somewhat embarrassing that the experience our guests had was far below average!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here on New Year's Eve. It was a big mistake. I reserved a table a month early for 6 pm, thinking we would beat the crowd and have a celebratory meal. It was pretty bad. We got there... the table was ready... and we were seated. Before my chair was pushed in, a menu was thrust at me. Our server rattled off specials and we could hardly hear her over the weirdly odd music. My daughter and I ordered champagne. It was brought promptly and was good. However, we were never asked during the rest of the meal if we wanted more. We felt pressured to order very quickly. We ordered salads, sides, and entrees, and were even asked about dessert. They were in a mission to get us out of there in a hurry. One course after another was pushed at us. The food was good, but we literally had our salad plates taken before we finished. I think my fork was in the air! Another funny event: two servers came out with our entrees. They put them down in front of the wrong people. They then proceeded to argue over who put the food down incorrectly. The bread came out with the entrees which was late. Things got even funnier when I heard a woman behind me say: \"I'm not ready for you to box it up! I am still eating it!\" I guess we weren't the only ones rushed. We did have carrot cake which was mediocre. Not bad not good. I used to work near Morton's and went there for happy hour. Wow! Was it ever a bad idea for a special meal. Our bill came to $300. Seriously, I expect better for that price. Disappointing and bordering on rude. PS... The horseradish potatoes were great!"}
{"text":"Exemplary steak house!!! Celebrating a birthday dinner? This is definitely a really nice place to go. Upon arriving, we were warmly greeted. The birthday girl was told \"Happy Birthday\" and we were seated promptly. How nice of them to recognize the birthday girl without being told to do so. 

Once we sat down, the manager walked over to the table, dropped off confetti on the table and gave us menus in the birthday girls name on it. VERY VERY special!!! 

Cajun Ribeye was seasoned to perfection!! Chicken Bianca was awesome and cooked perfectly, along with spinach and potatoes au gratin. Overall, wonderful experience. The staff was great! My water was never empty. The staff was very attentive, courteous and professional. 

DESSERT was great!!! Chocolate lava cake is what I believe we had. It was also complimentary for the birthday girl 

Great experience!!! Thanks Morton's"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, services and steaks. I will definitely go back.  It's one of my favorite steak houses, also some of my gourmet friends' too.  

The only thing stops me from going there is $$$$.  I can make very good steaks but probably not 5 stars yet."}
{"text":"The food was really good, loved the dim lighting and overall atmosphere. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and on point with service. I would definitely go back for another meal"}
{"text":"An incredible bar tender named Jessicca has joined the team. She more than satisfies your needs, has a positive outlook, and has made our visit a very pleasant one. Thank you Mortons for adding Jessicca to your team - she is a \"keeper\" for sure."}
{"text":"We went to Mortons for NYE because it's just so close and we can walk I would say anyone who goes must be aware it's an old school steak house and keep your expectations in line.  That said, excellent steaks, NY strips and filet, filet was slightly under cooked but an easy fix to request further firing.  Very pleasant server and ambiance, an all around decent time.  I'm a tough grader so 4 is really good."}
{"text":"My favourite steakhouse in the city. This is a special occasion place for me and my boyfriend but the atmosphere is relaxed and the service stellar. 

You will my regret spending the money to dine here. The food is impeccable and the servings generous. Filet mignon and the steaks are top notch -- cooked perfectly and so tasty but simple.

The lava cake and the sundae are guilty favourites. 

Skip ordering an app - you will NOT have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for our last dinner in Cleveland. It may not be the best steakhouse in Cleveland, but at least it had more options for one of my friends who is vegetarian. I decided to get the Center-Cut Prime Rib (~$45), medium rare of course because that's the only way to eat a steak! I made it Oscar-style as well, which means you add crab meat and asparagus to your meal (~$8). Since this is such a \"high end\" restaurant, your sides are not included. Yes, ridiculous, I know. So we also shared sides of creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, regular mashed potatoes (they ran out of baked potatoes, say what!), and horseradish seasoned mashed potatoes. This was not the best steak I have ever had, but it was not bad either. It was A-OK. The crab meat I thought was way too salty for me, and I swear I maybe got 2 pieces of asparagus cut into little bits to look like more. Would I go back? Probably not, unless my company pays for it again. Just too expensive for what you get.

Pros:
- very large menu, that even allows vegetarians to find something to eat here
- so many cuts of steak to choose from
- service was good, see below

Cons:
- ran out of baked potatoes (on a Saturday night too!); but at least the waiter provided mashed potatoes free of charge for my friend since they ran out
- not the tastiest of steaks that I have had
- so loud in the dining room, you have to shout for friends to hear!

Why I gave it a 2....
Won't be coming back here unless it's for a free meal. Very expensive, and you don't get what you pay for. You need to order your sides separately from your steak, so it adds up very quickly. How could a steak place run out of baked potatoes, especially for a Saturday night! If I am hungry for steak, I will go somewhere else for something that is more tasty and cheaper."}
{"text":"I visited Morton's with a group of about 12 guys, and we were all quite impressed. If you have a group that large, definitely go for a private room. It's a bit of a hassle in that you need to have a minimum number of people, minimum order, etc., but it's a much better experience when you have your own private space. 

We started off with some cocktails, and I would recommend getting a Manhattan with Maker's Mark bourbon. It went down very smooth! The cocktails are a bit pricey (these were $20), so I thought it was a good idea to switch to beer afterwards. They only have bottled beer here, but the selection was decent enough.

In terms of the steak, which of course is the main event here, get the Chicago-style prime bone-in ribeye. Our bartender swore it was the best steak and to get it medium rare and charred, so we took his advice. I don't usually do bone-in steaks, but I think I've been missing out! The steak was very tender and juicy, and the meat closest to the bone had so much flavour! I also had a bit of the blue cheese butter, which was an excellent garnish.

We also had some sides. I would recommend the au gratin potatoes and the grilled asparagus, which were both excellent.

The service was friendly and attentive.

This isn't the best steakhouse I've ever visited, but it was very good and one of the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"I used to like Morton's, maybe a decade ago.  The filet was way undercooked.  The only good thing was the lava cake.  The truffle fries didn't have enough truffle flavor.  Everything is still overpriced.  I prefer the Bouchon steak frites in the Venetian."}
{"text":"I visited Morton's on my anniversary. I had only been there once before several years ago. The atmosphere was terrific even though it was very busy. I was surprised to read some recent unfavorable reviews but I come to my own conclusions. The only odd thing was what the hostess said to me when I came in. I had a reservation for one, told her my name and she asked me if I wanted a table?? Odd, because I don't believe I would make a reservation if I didn't want a table. She said, \"single people usually sit at the bar.\" The girl was probably about 18 yrs. old. Move on. I was seated quickly and my server came by to get my drink order. I had the Morton's Cosmo which was yummy. I ordered the Bibb Lettuce salad which was very good, I ordered the bone-in ribeye and sautéed spinach and mushrooms. My steak was prepared perfectly and the spinach and mushrooms were amazing. I didn't need dessert and there was no way I could have eaten another bite, so I ordered the carrot cake to go. I read a recent review that said the carrot cake was small but I can tell you, that is definitely wrong. My piece has to weigh well over a pound. My experience was marvelous as I expected. I do not understand or agree with the slightly negative reviews. I hope other potential diners do not pay attention to those reviews. Visit Morton's and see for yourself. You will not be disappointed with the food or service. However, your meal will not be cheap but for a special occasion it is oh so worth it! My server, Taylor was very friendly and attentive and when I return at some time in the future, I am certain I will have another fabulous food festival."}
{"text":"All I can is MEH.  For the price point, I thinking the food to die for.  But I can't express how average it was for me.  First, the place was deserted, like two other parties in the whole joint. Huh....interesting. 

We went to Morton's to celebrate a friends birthday. They did it right with personalized menus and confetti on the table.  Hands down it was awesome. The gesture is pretty awesome since most places don't come close to that.  

I ordered a salad and the filet mignon tacos. I was that hungry.  The salad was cool.  The tacos you get more of everything else but filet, and should be called tacos of condiments hahahaha. The filet looked like beef jerk or barbacoa.  For me the best was the berries and cream.  Absolutely amazing!  

Just overall not impressed with the price and selection.  Maybe I partial to my favorites."}
{"text":"This is a SOLID high end steakhouse. I LOVE traditional steakhouses and this one fits the bill!

The steak is excellent. I had a rare porterhouse and it was extremely tender on Both sides. The sides were good and the deserts, well damn.... Some of the best carrot cake I've ever had.

The service was friendly and well informed, just like you'd expect. Unfortunately, they hit my pet peeve and it kept them from getting a five star rating. I had to ask for more to drink after my glass was empty. The wine glasses they kept full for others, but my club soda ran dry multiple times. That pushed them down a notch for me.

I'd still go back though. I promise you that!"}
{"text":"WOW. Considering I'm a vegetarian and this is a steakhouse, it was strange that I had lunch at Morton's yesterday. The only reason I went was b/c they were hosting a Women's Luncheon, and I wanted to attend that, but I didn't think they would have anything that I could actually eat or would like. It feels even stranger to say that they did and it was good! 

Morton's exceeded my expectations by quite a lot. 

First of all, Krista, their Sales & Mktng Manager, was incredibly accommodating. I emailed her ahead of time to see if they had a meatless option, and she was great about writing back quickly and gave me the alternative course, which was fully vegetarian, and even asked for confirmation if it would work. I said yes, and it did. 

The fist plate they served was a delicious deviled egg salad (they made sure I wasn't vegan before bringing this out). It was HUGE and very good. The serving size was actually enough to split between four people! The deviled eggs were diced into mini cubes and really nicely evenly spread throughout the salad. I loved the dressing too, though I'm not sure exactly what it was. I think it was ranch. 

The main course was another gigantic plate. It was filled with broccoli, sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. To look at, it was not that special, but the sauce that was added to all the vegetables was mouthwatering and made a plate of vegetables taste amazing. I also was served a ginormous bowl of mashed potatoes (also yummilious!). 

By the time dessert was ready, I was absolutely stuffed. I asked for my cheesecake to go and shared it with my parents when we had dinner. The portion was so large and it was soo rich that even though we split it three ways, it was still filling! 

The staff was very professional and the place was nice. I'm surprised to say I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"Ohh this was a very nice place for dinner, Expensive yes , worth it yes ! The veggies with the sauces excellent ! STEAKS OUT OF THIS WORLD! I will go back yes"}
{"text":"They were running a 2lb lobster special for $35 so my spouse and I made reservations. The place is in a crummy part of town off the strip. We were promptly seated and from beginning to end the service was great. Just a minor negative the waiter at times seemed forgetful but all in all as noted the service was terrific. The Morton salad had way to much dressing on it. I like enough dressing but this was over the top. The lobster was outstanding and was a true two pounder. The dining experience including the food was very good."}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, the kind of place you go with your family to celebrate a special occasion. I didn't find it to be romantic and probably wouldn't go here on a date.  

However, they treat you like kings.  I said it was my birthday when I made the reservation online, so they customize your menu to say Happy Birthday, and they also give you a free dessert -- AND IT'S DELICIOUS.

In comparison to other steakhouses, it feels special but without being insanely overpriced.  I like the Keg if you're just looking for steak on a random day, whereas Jacobs & Co would cost about 5 times as much money but you're not really getting that much of a different experience.  In fact, the desserts I've had at Jacobs & Co are not good and this dessert was delicious, and the variety and choice of sides is better at Morton's.  And you still see celebrities (we did!) at Morton's.

Our server Brent was really friendly and efficient, not at all uptight or formal.  The food was all delicious, but skip the onion rings, they are too crispy and nothing special.  Wine selection was good.  I really had a great time, and will probably be back for a special occasion again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. The morton's in SF has a great reputation so we figured we'd take our friend from DC here. Have never been visited a mortons before this. The steaks were mediocre, Ruth Chris even pinnacle Peak Patio steaks tasted better. Our friend's steak that he ordered was rare (he ordered medium) and had to be taken back. When it came back it was charred on the outside but still rare. By that time my husband and I were 1/2 way done w/ our meal. Our friend decided to switch the steak for another cut. He was, unfortunately, facing the kitchen where he got bird's eye view of the chef's arguing and visibly upset by this steak situation. They did bring out the new cut which was better cooked but our friend was questioning whether or not he should taste it. When we had originally ordered he also pre-ordered a dessert b/c we were told it took 1/2 to prepare. After he was done w/ the steak, they did bring out the dessert but after the issues w/ the steaks, he  forgot he ordered it and no longer had an appetite for it. This is the kicker. Rather than the waiter saying it was on the house as some form of compensatory effort, he quickly took it back. I know if i was the manager, I would have tried to compensate for the whole situation, i would have credited the customer with the bad experience. Not so here. Not only bad meal experience, expensive but also poor managerial decision. 
Will never go back and do not recommend. Skip this place and go to another steakhouse, you won't regret i."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have enjoyed the food every time. The only exception is twice now the waiter has either not understood or the cook didn't understand what medium on a steak was supposed to look like which was a tad bit irritating since this is a steak house. Their Crab Cakes are great. I usually order the Filet which is usually pretty good but not the best I've had. The Steamed Jumbo Asparagus is actually good (I usually don't like asparagus), the Bacon and Onion Mac and Cheese is good but I've had better for a rich mac and cheese, all of their potato dishes have been good and their Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake is amazing. This is a must if you get dessert, you have to order at the same time as dinner as it takes a bit to make but my mother loves this and I see why. Pretty darn good for a steakhouse, as long as our steaks are cooked properly we're happy and continue to come back to multiple locations."}
{"text":"Food is great!!!  Service is was unacceptable for the price.  Way too many patrons for the amount of wait staff. Our bottle of wine was listed as being from Napa, CA but is actually from Paso Robles, CA.  BIG DIFFERENCE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband received a gift card a few months ago to Morton's, so we decided to save it and use it towards a special dinner to celebrate our 1 week anniversary.  We got dressed up, he in a suit, me in a black dress and arrived a few minutes before our reservation time.  Upon checking in at the host stand, we were told there were a few tables to seat before us and it would just be a few minutes.  We headed to the crowded bar and grabbed a drink and felt that we were in everyone's way.  As we waited for our table we noticed how casual most people were dressed and many people were in jeans, t-shirts, and fleece.  About 15 minutes later, the hostess said our table was ready and we were led to a back dining room that had 4 open tables (making us wonder why we had to wait 15 minutes when it didn't appear people had left the restaurant in the time since we arrived to reset tables).  We were sat in a room with a table that decided to bring 2 children probably around age 2 and 5.  The parents didn't see any issue as the children yelled and ran laps around the table and disrupted the rest of the room as they laughed.
Our service was very good, but we've also experienced very good service at smaller, less expensive restaurants.  The food was good, but again not much better than other mid-priced locations that we frequent.  The grilled onion soup we ordered was just above warm, definitely not hot.  The grilled shrimp that came as part of my meal was tough, and my steak that I ordered as medium rare was closer to medium.  Overall, we were disappointed with the overall experience and basically felt like we were at Texas Roadhouse or Outback due to the clientele we were surrounding by.  We actually saw a man come in and head to the bar dressed in a sweat suit!  Next time we are looking to have a special night out, we will definitely choose another restaurant."}
{"text":"Sizzle then fizzle...  Not how I remembered Morton's, at all. Went here for a biz dinner, and needless to say I did not score any points with the clients. Lobster bisque was an amazing starter and had by all, but main courses were a major disappointment.   Steaks were ordered med well and came out med rare.  Tender and tasty, but not prepared to our liking. Bacon wrapped scallops undercooked, tasted very fishy and registered complaint.  The waiter apologized three times and made a point to say this was only the second complaint re: scallops in over two years. Don't they teach you to just let it go after one apology? Bacon mac and cheese was poor and tasted grainy like it was rolled in desert sand. Twice baked aug potatoes were excellent.  Credit was applied for scallops on bill but noted \"did not like\" for the reason credit given on the check. Dessert was skipped for obvious reasons, but should have been offered as a make good in my book. Going to save the money and go to Applebees next time..."}
{"text":"I'm not giving this five stars because even though I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Morton's last night, I think I prefer Jacob, so I guess I can't say Morton's is \"as good as it gets.\"

That being said, I really did have a nice experience at Morton's.
My friend and I shared the spinach salad, the bacon wrapped scallops, the signature cut steak, and the spinach and mushroom side. 

This was a perfect amount of food for the two of us. The spinach salad is HUGE. They put it on two separate plates, and each plate was full. The spinach was chopped into small pieces, which made for tidy dining!

The steak was perfectly cooked, medium rare, thick and delicious. 

The spinach and mushroom side was standard. 

The bacon wrapped scallops were good, but the bacon could have been crispier. 

There was a huge wine list, and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We went to Morton's tonight with the intention of having the $19.78 Make-A-Wish burger. Pricey for a burger, but it was at a steak house, and for a good cause. 

With the desire to end on a good note, here's the ugly:
1. It's in the Camelback Esplanade, easily the most screwed up yet supposedly upscale shopping center in the valley that smells like poo.
2. If one of the things that makes you \"cool\" is a verbal menu, you might want to make sure your servers know the menu. As a teacher, I have a fair amount of patience and mercy. Had we spent $200+ on dinner, which if we had partaken of their \"normal\" menu would have easily been the case, I would have been miffed. As it was, I was amused and a little concerned for the young man's career.
3. If Big Wong's Chinese on Indian School can consistently serve me a flawlessly cooked and completely grit-free dish of scallops for $10, why can't you manage it? 
4. You're a steak place. If you can't cook my burger correctly, do you think I'm going to risk $50 on a steak? Just sayin'... I know Ruth's Chris and Capital Grill can do it right.

Alright. It wasn't a TOTAL waste of time and money:
1. Hubby liked his 5-onion soup. I thought it was too thick and had an odd herbal or even floral bouquet. But I am not the French Onion soup connoisseur.
2. In spite of the done-ness issue, the burger was very well seasoned and tasty overall. You had a choice of 4 cheeses, onion and mushroom saute, and a side dish (any of their potato options or their standard salads). The Lyonnaise potatoes were really good, as was my baked potato, and as large as my two fists together).
3. The drinks were tasty and strong, but expensive. Their beer selection is crap. 

Ooops. What happened to the positive note? Extra star for the charity tie. There you go."}
{"text":"How do you balance out some really great things about Morton's and some really not great things?

Let's start with the aspects that will probably keep me coming back.  In terms of steak they are purists.  If you really like added flavors to your meat then this may not be the perfect steak for you, but like me, I want tender- and for the record Morton's has the tenderest steak I've encountered in the valley.  I also don't want added flavors but to let the meat be the center stage.  Dry aged beef that is 'prime\" cut.  Perfection.

I've had both the rib eye, and the fillet and never have been disappointed.  

Their sides are definitely well made and delicious- from their Caesar salad (home made dressing, just the right amount) to my favorites being creamed spinach and the hash brown potatoes.  For a vegetable the asparagus is perfect since it's served crisp and fresh.

You may be wondering why not 4 or 5 stars?  First is value.  I understand good things aren't cheap but $18.00 for deviled eggs was the first for me.  Hopefully it comes with salad or vegetable for that amount of money.  Even the desserts for the taste are a bit overpriced.  

The second slight annoyance is the inconsistency in service.  Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just okay.  Well okay is acceptable if your at the Outback but if your paying prices that support top notch dining I would expect top notch service.  Never complained but wondering if the management sees how many people wait around just to be offered water or a drink when they are first seated?  Also how about not rushing people to ask if they want dessert when clearly they aren't finished with dinner.

 Lastly, and here is a big factor for me- if you charge $17.00 for your premium vodka martini, please don't measure my pour.  Morton's is, according to 2 different servers, obsessed with measuring their alcohol.  Yes, the place that charges a premium for a Jack and Coke wants to make sure that 1.5 oz is the limit you will receive.  My question is why?  You can charge $15.00 for a drink that most places charge $9.00 for, and if the guest wants a drink that really tastes like Jack Daniels doesn't it make sense.  Probably why the Capital Grill bar is packed on a Friday night and Morton's has maybe a handful of people.  Anytime corporate accounting starts dictating the standards over common sense or giving fair value for what is charged is when you start loosing repeat customers and potential repeat business.  I'd love to go to Morton's more but my fiancee likes her cosmopolitan martini a certain way and I like a good kick to my Jack and Coke.  $30.00 for two drinks and your worried about 2.5 ounces vs 1.5 ounces?????"}
{"text":"Everything tasted ok, but they couldn't cook the steak correctly. I asked for medium rare, I also asked if them to please not over cook it. They said it will be a warm red center. Steak came out medium well. If I wasn't with a big group I would have returned it."}
{"text":"We were greeted promptly and shown to a nice table in the middle of the room. Our waiter was excellent, he accomodated and entertained us while providing great service. My bibb lettuce salad with balsamic vinagrette, blue cheese, walnuts and apples was superlative, one of the best salads I have experienced in quite some time. My portherhouse steak was perfect in cut flavor and cooked a perfect medium rare. We saved no room for dessert but the presentation was tempting. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I'm ok with Morton's, it surely doesn't come to mind when I think of an upscale steakhouse, if I want to go to one.

The portions are huge, which is a good thing considering how pricey they are.  The filet mignon single cut is tasty, the chopped salad delightful & the sautéed spinach & mushrooms are to die for!
Oh & of course dessert, the very refreshing mixed berries.

The wait staff are very attentive & the one night I went, our waitress went a little overboard.

The ambiance is nice & intimate & I love that it's two story."}
{"text":"Noted on the OT reservation it was hubby's 50th birthday. The Morton's staff was super. Our table was strewn with decorative confetti and menus that were customized at the top with Happy 50th Birthday (we kept them as momentos). The Maitre D' & General Manager greeted my hubby with birthday wishes. The Hostess took our picture and returned with a nice card with staff signatures that held the picture.  Nice quiet atmosphere for a Saturday night. Seating was very comfy. We could see the kitchen straight on. 

The menu was kinda old school high end steak house fare. I had the \"smaller\" Rib eye. It was really heavily salted and a came medium when I requested med. rare, very disappointed. The rib eye was well marbled but it was just okay. Hubby was happy with his double cut Filet Mignon and was done to his liking. Asparagus & Brussel sprouts were excellent. We received a complimentary birthday dessert with candles! I had the yummy chocolate mousse.

 We had lovely service from our waiter, Brandon."}

{"text":"Refined, classic style steak restaurant, Mortons will not disappoint those who are looking for a traditional upper end place. 

Yards of linen, tons of silverware, and hordes of waiters make this place a must go in Pittsburgh.

Expect to pay heavily for this experience, it is well worth it."}

Some body, please take my money but also please don't disappoint a steak lover. Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Morton's.

Well, the Morton's in Toronto certainly does the brand credit.
The location is quite good, as it is located right next to a hotel, very near the University of Toronto.
The ambiance of the restaurant is quite nice, and I'd actually recommend sitting somewhere close to the kitchen so you can get a good look at the food being prepared (quite cool).

When we arrived, we ordered the small filet minion, center cut prime ribeye, au gratin potatoes, with one sparkling water. For appetizer we had the shrimp cocktail. The total came to just under $150.

Overall, everything we ordered was great. I can't say much more than that, but one should definitely consider getting the shrimp cocktail, as I feel like even though it's expensive, you get your money's worth. Also consider coming somewhat early (6:30)  PM) if you want to successfully preorder one of the desserts, as it takes a little while to make, and runs out fast due to the popularity. 

Also, they give you free dessert if it's your birthday, so consider coming here to celebrate! But don't abuse this courtesy- they're really so nice over here."}
{"text":"Steak was good, sides were jus O.K. The waitress was hot, that always helps. The service was excellent, the food is average and kind of expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"So, I was here for a business team dinner. There were 13 of us and it almost seemed like we were the only people in the restaurant on a Sunday at like 730pm. That seemed a bit weird to me. Okay, I may be exaggerating a bit about being the only table there but it definitely seemed empty.

Large bread roll that was the size of small watermelon - it was warm on the inside but not as crunchy on the outside as I like. Minus 1/2 star. I didn't want to fill up since I was eating at a steakhouse so I didn't eat much of it. 

Appetizers ordered: bacon-wrapped scallops, seafood dish with lobster and crab pieces, and shrimp cocktail. Nothing too exceptional here. Minus 1/2 star. The scallops were large and I did have another since it was sitting there with no one eye-balling it. 

Drinks: 1 magnum of red wine (can't remember the name but it was good), 2 bottles of cham-painnnnn. 

I ordered the double porterhouse with my colleague. It was cooked medium rare and it was good but not outstanding. It was large and in charge but I didn't taste any flavor that would make me crave it again. Minus 1 star.

Desserts ordered at the table: souffle (no WOW factor), sundae (enough for 2-3 people to share), choc lava cake (i've seen larger). Minus 1/4 star.

I can't complain too much since it was free on the company but I wouldn't come back here on my own dime. I think I would give this a 2.75 so rounding up would be a 3."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite steakhouse. It was mediocre food. The service was good. The atmosphere was good. But the food was okay. We got the cold seafood platter for 2. It's a bit small for our liking. The bread was good but they just give you a giant roll of bread. It's kinda of an awkward situation. It's not cut up. They didn't give you a knife. But it's not the kind of restaurant you would use your hands at. We got the jumbo lump crab cakes and rack of lamb. The crab cakes were good but not great. The lamb was good. It was cooked good. But nothing to write home about. The most disappointing part was desert. You have to preorder it 30 minutes in event. It's literally a frozen lava cake that they heat up. I guess I would expect something homemade if it takes 30 minutes. It was gross. Tasted like it had been in the freezer for a year. It's mediocre food and a 5 star price. I wouldn't go back. There are too many great steakhouses in the area. Especially across the street."}
{"text":"I am only writing a review for the bar area.  My husband and I were In Town for the weekend staying at the Ritz which is attached to the building Mortons is also housed in.  We decided to have an after dinner drink and dessert.  We shared their famous hot chocolate cake which had a gooey molten center!!! I had the Mortons Lemon Drop Martini, which was also great.  My husband has a summer sangria which had wine, vodka, and another liquor, very strong, but surprisingly refreshing.  Service was great and the bartender and the cocktail waitress anticipated our every need."}
{"text":"I was taken here for work.  I have to say I was surprised as this place was a solid choice.

It was a large group of more than 10.  We had it all, Wine, drinks, steak, seafood, and even a vegatarian.  And nobody had any problems, issues or complaints.  

Service was good and attentive.  My bone in ribeye was cooked perfectly (proper med-rare)  The oyster rockafellers was made well and the asparagus spears were huge but still tender and not over cooked.

I was even a bit impressed with the vegetarian plate.   Now we are in a steak house but they have this monster vegetarian plate that I would almost order it if they didn't have steak!

a couple people got dessert and they all looked really good.  The souffles were light, airy and nobody could say bad about them.

why 4 stars?  cause while everything was really well made there just wasn't that thing that made you go.. OH YEAH..  The steak was GREAT and cooked perfect... but wasn't the best I've had.  Hard pressed to pick the things... but these are 4 solid stars.

Ill be back here and hopefully can figure out why I just cant bring the the 5 star yet!"}
{"text":"Great place  . My favorite steak reaturant in Pittsburgh . The bar area could be bigger . The valet's were professional and quick ."}
{"text":"To begin, I am honored to be the first one to review this fine establishment.

Morton's is one of those places that you go for a special occasion, or when someone else is footing the bill. ;-) Because it sure is not cheap. Expect to pay around $100 pp for a three course meal, including drinks. 

My uncle was in town for a visit, and he had a hankering for a good hamburger. Seeing as though he was staying at the Avenue Park Hyatt, we weren't about to go to McDonald's. Instead we moseyed on down to Morton's next door to the hotel. 

For my dinner I ordered the sea bass ($42). I know what you're thinking, how can you go to a steak joint and order fish. Well, I guess I like to swim against the current. I was looking for something a little more on the lighter side. Moreover, I knew that my girlfriend was going to be ordering a steak, so I knew that I would at the very least get a taste of what I was missing. 

For starters, I went with the French Onion Soup topped with Swiss Cheese ($12). It was served piping hot and tasted just as French Onion Soup should. It was perfect. No complaints. My girlfriend and my uncle ordered the Caesar Salad. Also heard no complaints in that department.

For dessert, I ordered the molten lava cake, topped with Haagen Daas ice cream. Too bad I was pretty stuffed by that point because I'm sure that it would have tasted better than it actually did. I was so full by the end that I was ready to be rolled out on a cart.

Also, the service was impeccable and the ambiance was wonderful. 

I have no reason to award Morton's anything less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"I enjoy mortons for their great service and attentive wait staff. The food I felt was that of a Keg tier food or less. The keg I've thought to taste better than mortons. Although they have yummy appetizers. Like the truffle fries. The steaks are too fatty and not marbled correctly. But everything else is good"}
{"text":"We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon from Raymond Vineyards designed especially for Morton's called primal cut and it was boldly delicious and perfect for the steaks we ordered.

Superb aged four weeks steaks! My husband had the porterhouse and I had the NY strip both perfectly prepared medium rare! We ordered a side of mushrooms in au jus and they accompanied the steaks nicely.

Before the steaks arrived they served fresh butter and a hot boule of bread that you could smell baking because of the scent of the toasted onion on top. We also shared the Morton's salad which is greens mixed with blue cheese dressing topped with egg and anchovies. All the portions are ginormous and so easily shared!

My husband ordered the molten hot lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce which was made to order and ordered when we ordered the steaks. It was divinely chocalatey! He also ordered a tawny port to end the meal. I had tastes and sips of both and they were delicious, and was too full to have my own!

We enjoyed sitting together in the circular booth and talking and sharing a superb meal  
made all the more pleasant with a wonderful waiter and maitre d'."}
{"text":"After however many dozen trips to Morton's Cleveland, it's about time to give it a review...

It's a Morton's.  If you know one Morton's you know pretty much what there is to know about Morton's...  It's tasty, a bit pricey, with the 1920's-40's attire so common to the American Steakhouse.  

Which brings to mind, why do they all wear that style of clothing?

Whatever the reason, it is what it is.  You get what you pay for and the service solid, vintage Morton's. 

Enjoy!~"}
{"text":"Very good food!  Went here over a year ago and the food was awesome. First had Mortons in NY years ago and always wanted to go back. Very satisfied to find one in Vegas. Filet mignon with a nice wine was my choice...don't recall which wine."}

{"text":"We decided to take advantage of the Queens Feast, to revisit Morton's. It's been a couple of years since our last visit. Let's start with the ambiance which is that of an modern urban steak house. Close tables, noisy and very chic! We were seated upstairs which allowed for ease of conversation although the servers work their tails off running up and down. More about the service later.

We ordered from the QF menu. We ordered Caesar salads which appeared to be a single salad portion served on two plates. Pretty much dry and tasteless. Extra dressing was served, upon request but a poor imitation of a classic.

Our steaks were perfectly prepared albeit the smallest 8 ounce steak I've ever eaten. The lyonnaise potatoes served my Bride were soft, crisp less and scant. My asparagus was cooked properly but also short on quantity. Our Creme-brûlée was good.

Our server, Tara did an outstanding job from start to finish. Her efforts, personality and enthusiasm made this the star rating a 3. Considering the regular prices, I wouldn't say the food we were served deserve their price points but we did enjoy our dining experience which was enhanced by Tara!"}
{"text":"I went to Morton's The Steakhouse for Queen's Feast....I have definitely experienced much better.  Paid $15 for a martini (nothing special) and $7 for a domestic beer (really?). 
I got the onion soup (good, but unusual), steak (no flavor, had to send it back initially for being medium well vs. medium rare) and for dessert I got creme brulee (ice cold).
The worst part was the service....I felt as if food was being thrown in front of me...literally (so did others at our table).  Never was a plate placed in front of me or straight.....with each course I had to pull the plate in front of me!  I expect more at a restaurant that charges these prices.
Now granted, I was there on a Saturday night with a group of 10, but there were many empty tables around us....now I know why.
I would never go back to pay this for what I received....much better places to try in Charlotte."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with this place, in fact, it is superb.. that being said.. the real value in Morton's is the quality of the meats and seafood.. the experience is similar to Ruth's Chris or Sullivan's or Del Frisco, but the freshness of the goods was just the slightest bit better..  they bring you the cuts and live lobster table side and show you the raw/live meat.. 

I have to say that having seen Michael Jordan at Del Frisco and Yao Ming at Morton's... the other value is seeing famous people in Charlotte. 

If you want the ultimate steak..  and have the money to spend.. go for it, but if you are just looking for a nice place to take someone special this one compares to it's slightly less expensive brothers..."}
{"text":"I do like this place.  Went down for a holiday party and the valet parking was HORRIBLE!  Other than that, was a great Morton's experience.  Everyone is always polite and everything is always cooked to your liking.  I wish I could save room for desert...maybe next time."}
{"text":"Mortons is the only chain restaurant that can earn a 5 star from me.  Superior service that is remarkably welcoming considering they are in Kierland.  The steaks are wonderful and the patio was a perfect place to enjoy the fruits (or leaves) of the humidor.  I'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary. Service was absolutely fantastic from the time we walked in until we left. We had used Open Table to book our reservation and mentioned that it was our anniversary and they printed custom menus. It was a very nice touch.

{"text":"My family and I had our Christmas Eve dinner here (2016), and it was by far the worst dining experience of our lives. 

Our experience started off great, our hors d'oeuvres and wine were excellent. But once it came down to our main course it went south pretty rapidly. 

When you dine at upscale places you're used to a specific presentation and representation of the restaurant. None of our meals came at the same time, my mothers fillet was over cooked( asked for medium rare and received well done- anyone who eats a good cut knows anything more than medium rare just destroys the meat) my brother had ordered the bone-in. I've never seen that specific cut of meat served as thin as it's was, and his was over cooked and brought out ice cold. 

As for my father and I, we have a tradition of going to the palm and splitting a lobster. We were told we had a female 6lb on reserve. The lobster was brought out last, un-cracked, no utensils, no lemons, didn't put the bibs on us. When we were insulted with the presentation and asked them to please crack the shells for us, We received attitude and the whole lobster was taken away and brought into the kitchen. Anyone who's had lobsters knows that the lobster is ALWAYS presented and then cracked table side. When the lobster was brought back out we were missing 90% of the meat. And that's not an exaggeration. The plate they put the meat on was a large bread plate. Whatever meat they platted was destroyed and slapped on a plate. When we asked where the rest of the meat was, we again were replied with attitude..- this is all the meat- a 6lb lobsters meat wouldn't fit on a small bread plate let's be serious. Also when we were told the lobster was female I pointed out the rue was green not red, which would indicate the lobster was a male. I was told I was mistaken, which I was not.

The manager was asked to come to our table to go over the disaster of our Christmas Eve meal. We see our dad one time a year and this is what we look forward to all year. The manager was the RUDEST man I've ever encountered and he tried to embarrass my father. We've eaten at Morton's all over the country and it's safe to say this was an embarrassment of the establishment and the management team should be ashamed.

Thank you for ruining our Christmas Eve dinner . Definitely one we will never forget. We will make sure to stay at The Palm."}
{"text":"Great experience, Erica, our waitress was awesome, good conversation and fun with our table.  Our meals were excellent, we all had the 6oz. filets cooked to perfection and the sour cream mashed potatoes were really, really smooth and tasty.  Chocolate mousse, creme brulee were all top notch."}
{"text":"Toronto is a city of steakhouses. Having eaten at all the other big-boy carnivore joints in town (Harbour Sixty, Ruth Chris, ect.) I was anxious to add this notch to my belt. 

This Yorkville beef mecca is at the base of the Park Hyatt, which boasts one of the best rooftop bars in the city. Think septogenarian bartenders in vests and ties who still know that a martini is made with gin and contains vermouth. But I digress.

For one fat price tag, here's what you get: kid-glove service, retro-upscale charm, monster delicious hunks of meat (aged 60 days, I hear?) and an obscenely marked-up but well-considered wine list.

If you're from a place like Winnipeg, take mom and dad here to impress."}
{"text":"We got to Morton's quite frequently and we always find its very good and always consistent.  All thought everything is Ala Carte they have a great steak and seafood special we always get that is $55 and you get a seafood app, fillet, side, and desert and they will basically substitute anything and for $10 more you can get a bigger and/or different cut.  Make sure to try the chocolate soufflé it is the best i've had anywhere hands down!  We will even have dinner at another restaurant and after dinner go to Morton's just for the soufflé and a nightcap."}
{"text":"Management likes to think of themselves as upper class snobs but in reality they are just wannabe tools."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my visit to Morton's on Saturday evening. After having heard good reviews from others and given its reputation, I was looking forward to treating my friend for her birthday dinner there.
When confirming the reservation, the staff on the phone told me that Morton's does a birthday special. My friend and I looked forward to our evening.

When we got seated, we had to ask for the menu and the wine menu. Service was not prompt.
Then when the bread came, we had to send it back - my friend found a long strand of light coloured hair in her piece. Both of us have dark hair.

I'll admit we took a while to decide what we would like for dinner, but our server rarely ever came to check on us. So this added to the wait. We placed our main food order around 45 minutes after being seated. We wanted to review the full wine list, and had to ask another server for it. After we ordered, we realized we forgot to add the black truffle butter to our order and figured we'd add it when the waitress came for our drink order. But that never happened.

We didn't get a chance to place both the black-truffle butter order and our drink order until after our entree arrived.
The steak itself was wonderful but since we wanted to enjoy the steak with wine and butter, we had to wait a bit before we could it which led to it being cool. The sides were also excellent.

However, the appetizer (baked escargot) and the dessert (crème brûlée) are underwhelming in terms of flavour and left a lot to be desired . Also, we never got any birthday surprise - still don't know what it was supposed to be.

Perhaps it was a busy night and the restaurant was understaffed. However, given the restaurant and its stature, I expected more."}
{"text":"I attended Morton's Steakhouse last night for the first time and I'd have to say I enjoyed it. The staff had great service on top of showing that they care about your experience. It's a nice elegant setting with dim lights and soft music. I ordered the Cajun Ribeye and I'd have to say it has been one of the best steaks I've ever had a restaurant. It was very tender and very juicy. This place is not in your normal price range so be ready to have a heavy bill but the experience was worth it if you want a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Overall I really enjoyed dinner here. Very nice place off the strip so it wasn't all that busy. Very appropriately priced. Food was great. The service was good waiter was very polite and funny. Definitely a spot I would eat at again. It was a very solid restaurant overall good. Nothing that absolutely blew me away though it was all that I expected it to be."}
{"text":"The best part about our visit to this Morton's was our waitress, Karen.  She was great, had super suggestions and even let us in on a few secrets on how/what to order.  Normally, we LOVE Morton's!  This one was a bit disappointing.  The lettuce was a bit wilted, the hash browns too crisp and my fillet that I ordered medium rare came out medium and a bit burnt.  The veggies were great and we were too full for dessert, so we took it home.  I would suggest ordering your steak a bit under what you normally eat.  My wife ordered hers medium rare too and it was closer, but still not the normal Morton's excellence.  The place was only about half-full on a Friday night, so a \"too-busy\" cook or kitchen cannot be blamed.  Probably many other better steaks to be had in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is where my Husband of 4 years proposed to me to marry on My Birthday on Valentine's Day ; )
Romantic Setting,Good Food and Good Customer Service!"}
{"text":"Amazing steaks and service.

The bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked. I also had a crab cake which was full of large pieces of crab and really no filler. The 5-onion soup was good but not great. It is a french onion style soup but I don't much care for the two burnt croutons they put on top and the cheese was not melted correctly. The grilled asparagus and mashed potato sides were also a perfect choice. The potatoes were buttery and smooth. The balsamic glaze on the asparagus really added a nice flavor overall.

They have a steak and seafood special. Ask about it. You get a petite filet [which you can change for an additional charge] a side, soup or salad, an appetizer and a dessert. It is the same deal offered at \"tix for tonight\"

The key lime pie was really great, too. Not as tart as a key lime pie should be, but still a delicious piece of pie."}
{"text":"Made reservations thru Open Table for Restaurant Week and decided to treat our young adult sons with a steak dinner. A torrential rainstorm cause one to run significantly late. Our waiter was gracious about that and helped slow the pace of our dinner to accommodate. He struck the right notes of funny, helpful, and concerned with our satisfaction. He gets most of the credit for the three stars. 

The food -- it's a problem. Even at the discounted Restaurant Week price, this is a pricy restaurant. And while the food is good, it's not great and it doesn't begin to compare with the quality of steak and sides we've enjoyed at Steak 44, Flemings and Capital Grill.

Here's a run -down. First course, 3 had Caesar salad, which was \"pretty good,\" according to the family. I had onion soup, which was tasty and very hot. Not exceptional or deep in flavor but \"pretty good.\" All 4 of us ordered the 6-oz filet. I think they lacked seasoning and were not as tender as I would expect from a high end restaurant.  They were \"pretty good\" (way better than Outback, not nearly as good as steak houses mentioned above).

We did the rounds of dessert: chocolate mousse, cheesecake, chocolate soufflé and creme brûlée.  Soufflé was rubbery. Mousse was proclaimed \"excellent\" by my son. Cheese cake and brûlée were \"pretty good.\"

So I have to call the entire dinner just \"pretty good.\"  Food was not worth the hefty price tag but the service was very nice. I expected way more."}
{"text":"(I apologize in advance for such a long review, but I had to tell my story) I am almost embarrassed to write this review. However, because I was treated so nicely, I felt compelled to do so. Let me start off by telling the backstory. At his previous job, my roommate used to go to work dinners with vendors, quite often. 3 out of the 4 main places were local steakhouses, and 2 out of the 3 had phenomenal carrot cake. Well, every time he went to one of these establishments, he made sure to bring a piece home to me. Now, all I could remember about the carrot cakes were that they were huge in size and divine tasting. The last time he went, he brought home two slices and they were 3 or 4 layers (I really cannot remember) and it took up the whole container. Well, jump forward to this past Thursday. 

     My doctor/employer went to a seminar that was held at Morton's Thursday evening. When she told me she was going, I expressed to her how good the carrot cake is. She, in turn, asked if I wanted her to buy me a piece. Of course, I said yes. Friday morning, I went to the office to pick up my piece of carrot cake. It was still in the Morton's bag. I got home, took it out of the bag and noticed this piece was only 1 1/2, almost 2 layers. This was nothing like the pieces I had enjoyed just a few months back. So, I assumed she took half, in order to try it for herself. I did not mind because she bought it. However, today, I asked her about it at the office and she advised me she had not touched the cake and it was just the way it was handed to her. Well, I was outraged, borderline incensed, over this perceived slight on the part of Morton's. It just so happens that I had to run an errand that would take me right past Morton's. So, I told the doctor I was going to stop by there and address this issue with the manager. 

     Now, on my drive over, I played the scenario in my head stating I would go up to the hostess and ask her how many layers their carrot cake has. If she told me two, I would not bother going any further with this. To my surprise, when I walked through the door, the manager was there at the hostess' stand. So, I proceeded to address my issue with them. The hostess agreed with me that she thought it was 3 layers. She, also, agreed that the piece used to fill the entire container it was placed in. The manager proceeds to go to the kitchen to verify this, at my request. He returns with a fresh piece that looks identical to the piece my doctor had purchased for me. Imagine my horror and embarrassment at realizing this is the size they are now giving out. I wanted to just curl up and die. I was so apologetic to them for the misunderstanding and wasting of their time. I told him the piece was identical to mine and I am not sure of what I was thinking. He offered for me to take the piece but, I declined admonishing him to sell it to another customer. However, he insisted I take it. I graciously did so, apologized once more and exited stage left with my tail between my legs and head held down in complete shame. The manager and hostess were great. She kept reiterating how they believe my story, which made me feel really good because in no way, shape or form was I trying to get over on them. This is why I am sharing my story and giving them 5 STARS (If I could do 6, I would). They deserve it. The food is stellar and, now, I know the customer service is too."}
{"text":"We decided to have our dinner here since this is the nearest place from our hotel. My first time at Morton's gives me a good impression upon entering the Restaurant. Very nice ambience, the reception will get you seated right away and no long wait for your server to come take your order. Everything we've order is so tasty and delicious. Very satisfying dinner. Oh my God, I even forgot ny mame for a moment :-)!!!!!!! The only reason I'm giving it three star is because we were offered a membership card for $25 but you get the $25 dollar points back to your card plus another 25 from dinning that night so it's a total of $50 points and you can redeem to over 500 location in 37 state. Although the server explained it to us that it is non expirable points but he did not explain that we need to register within 24 hours. I only found out when I am on my 4th day in Vegas and tried to register and download their apps and the points in no longer there!!!!!! I sent an email twice but no hope. The next day I found the brochure that comes with the membership card and it says  \"register is within 24 hours\" My recommendation to all the tourist to do not buy a membership card especially when you are a  tourist. Obviously you have no time to read the terms and condition for any offers because of your busy schedule going all over the tourist spot. You will just definitely rely what ever the server explains to you and if there's a missing information then it's a lost in your part! I am still coming back at Morton's if I'm in town mainly only for their food! A bit disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had our wedding reception at Morton's Las Vegas on Thursday, April 2, 2015 in one of their private boardrooms. Diana Takai was the person that organized the entire event. She could not have been more wonderful, thoughtful, and efficient if she had tried. Every dealing with her leading up to the event was comfortable and instilled great confidence in us that the event would be a major success. On the date of the event, our waiters--Jessie, Gabriel, and Ron were the most awesome and attentive waitstaff that I have encountered in quite some time. KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU AT MORTON'S LAS VEGAS--you have done what very few restaurants can do these days--DELIVER A TOP-NOTCH, QUALITY EXPERIENCE THAT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY. Thank you for making our special day so very special. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, Great atmosphere, I love it. 

This place has the best stake in Las Vegas. If you are visiting los vegas you must come here. They will take care of you.

I can't wait to come back HUNGRY. 

I recommend Morton's to all friends and and family."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Morton's to celebrate our engagement.  We made reservations in case it was packed but it wasn't really when we arrived at 6:15pm (on a Sunday evening).  The waiter was very friendly and helpful.  

I've been reading some reviews so I had a vague idea of what I wanted to order.  In the end:

For appetizer, we had the Baked Platter which comprised of the crabcake (we didn't find it amazing - it was tasty but a little on the dry side), jumbo shrimp Alexander (very nice and tasty), bacon wrapped scallop (very good and tasty).  I didn't want the oyster and they were able to swap that for another crabcake.  I probably should have asked for a scallop instead. 

We had the chopped house salad.  It was very tasty as well. The portion wasn't huge but I was starting to fill up a bit after finishing that.

For steak, we had the center cut filet mignon (very nicely done, juicy and great quality beef) and the Chicago style prime bone in ribeye.  That was quite nice as well but more on the fatty side.  

We also ordered the Parmesan and Truss Matchstick fries.  They gave us a very generous portion.  I'm not a huge cheese fan and it was quite cheesy but I didn't mind it. 

We ordered the Legendary Hot chocolate cake for dessert and it was decent.  I wouldn't say it's the best I've had but it's pretty good.  

NOTE:  Hindsight,  we ordered too much food.  We finished the salad, appetizer, and the dessert but we took a good chunk of our steaks and the fries home.  

For 2 people, the total came to $255 (tip included).   We didn't order any wine though."}
{"text":"BOOM! - Nailed that 5 star rating!

Started with fresh onion bread, warm and crumbly then moved on to lobster soup. After they brought out the food sample tray, with live lobster winking at me saying \"please put me out of my misery! I can't stand my roomates anymore!\", I decided instead on the Filet Mignon with a side of Asparagus. 

Sorry lobster, hang in there!

Absolutely perfect. Excellent service!

Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I was there in April 2011- for my uncles birthday celebration... We received quality customer service and of course my meals was delicious :) plus we got memorable picture taken which make memories last forever!!!"}
{"text":"Morton's... Well where to start. I took my girlfriend here to celebrate some important events that occured all within a week. It took close to a week to decide where we had wanted to try and we decided first to make it upscale, and secondly about steak. Well we had our clear choice to be Morton's. 

We enjoyed the ambience and atmosphere that was provided as well as the wonderful and informed wait staff. We had reservations and were actually sat early which was fantastic! I am a big lover of steaks so I chose the porterhouse, while my girlfriend had the double cut filet. 

We started first with a salad wedge which I found to be tasty, very crisp and fresh. My girlfriend had the lobster bisque which she loved. Our steaks came out after we finished our staters and our wonderful bread loaf. 

I must say the steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it and I ate every bit of that monster! We finished off with the hot chocolate cake which was devoured rather quickly. All in all it was a wonderful experience and for me very much worth the money."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at a Morton's and it doesn't seem to matter where you are in the US.  They all have the same feel inside, regardless of location and the food and service is always terrific.  I was there on business and as always, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I went to Morton's for the first time on 04/19/2014 to celebrate my boyfriends birthday.  Overall, the experience was exceptional.  

The meal started with prosciutto wrapped mozzarella.  It truly was one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  Our salads were served next - one caesar salad and one chopped spinach salad.  Each were good but nothing special.  For our entrees, we ordered the porterhouse steak with peppercorn rub and the 6 oz. filet mignon with shrimp and scallops.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, but my partner thought the rub on the porterhouse was overpowering (I tended to agree).  We also ordered horseradish mashed potatoes and sauteed broccoli florets as side dishes.  Both were amazing.  Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake rounded out the night (in addition to one bottle of wine and 2 alcoholic coffee drinks).  

This was a perfect way to celebrate a special occasion.  Beings that we had never been there before, it was important for my boyfriend and I to try a bit of everything!   We had more than enough food to eat and even had plenty to take home with us.  The cost (including tip) was approximately $330.  BUT, to be honest (and I can't believe I'm saying this), the service made it worth it!!!  The wait staff was better than any I have ever experienced...very personable, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  More than anything (even the taste/quality of the food), the service is what will bring us back to Morton's Steakhouse for our next special occassion."}
{"text":"Good steak. Service was great. Speedy service requested and speedy service received... Would recommend if your looking for a decent steak  in the charlotte area.."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner, everything was fine.  Ordered oysters on the half shell as an appetizer.  With in 10 minutes after eating them I became violently ill.  After getting sick in their restroom and barely making it back to our hotel, it is quite clear that I got shellfish poisoning.  My wife called the manager to let them know we had just spent $350 on a meal that she had to have boxed up (I was unable to even make it until the food came) and he was very rude, offered no apology and stated that I must have been sick before I arrived, and hung up.  I felt absolutely fine prior to eating the oysters.  I have always been a fan of Morton's, but after bad food and a manager that doesn't give a damn, we will NEVER be back.  Way to ruin a Valentine's Day.  Pick another restaurant."}
{"text":"It's very expensive, and it's a showpiece. But it's good. You know? It's worth a few hundred bucks once every few years for us normies to feel special. Morton's does the job. Attentive servers, perfectly cooked food. High taste quality. What do you want? To feel fancy? Go to Morton's. You'll spend three hundred dollars for two people. And you'll feel fancy."}
{"text":"My experience on a Friday evening was fantastic! I chose this restaurant for two reasons: I wanted steak & the location was adjacent to my hotel (it was near blizzard conditions). I was promptly seated. John, despite appearing relatively young, is an \"old school\" waiter - he takes pride in his work, makes inquiries, & offer suggestions without being overbearing or intrusive. He understands it's all about the guest experience. Impeccable.

I had the 5-onion soup, 12 oz. filet & sour cream mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent. My steak was so tender I literally cut it with my fork. Probably one of the best steaks I ever had.

Is it expensive? Like most upscale, downtown metropolitan restaurants that offer both excellent food & service, it is. Morton's is for those seeking a dining experience, not \"let's grab something to eat.\""}
{"text":"We've eaten at several Morton's. This one is far more expensive than the others we have been to. The food was typical but there's so many places to eat in Vegas - why come here?"}
{"text":"I had a ribeye with mushrooms n Mac n cheese. Steaks were cooked perfectly and service also was very good. Overall I enjoyed the experience and would definitely go back. For a Sunday the place was packed which explained why Morton's has its own Diehard fans."}
{"text":"Ok, so the wait staff isn't great but I mostly care about the food.

We got lamb chops and crab cakes for appetizers - both were delicious with a capital D.  The bruschetta was plain and a bit soggy.  The filets were wonderfully seasoned - possibly using seasoned salt instead or with the plain.  The plates weren't very hot so the meat was cooked to order and stayed that way through the whole meal.  The asparagus was trimmed nicely and a bit overdone, but the mashed potatoes were seasoned perfectly.  

Would I go back - definitely for a good meal.  If service means a lot to you or you want to impress someone, I wouldn't recommend it.  Its not that they're rude by any means, its just rather clumsy with several faux pas."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last night I ordered the prime New York strip it was very chewy and fatty definitely not prime I would not go back"}
{"text":"This is definitely an old school hang out with a classic menu.   Although my steak was cooked perfectly,  I can't speak to the quality of the ingredients as they lacked natural flavour of meat and fish that I love.   My biggest gripe, though, would be the overcooked scallops.  If you are an adventure Eater or like common things cooked in uncommon ways, I would skip this one."}
{"text":"I held my wife's surprise bday in one of the private rooms. I was not charged any extra fees for booking a private function. As well they provided us with several attentive staff that took care of us throughout the night. They also prepared a pre-set menu for us. The steak was top quality (and I am comparing this to NY steakhouses such as wolfgang and benjamins). Overall I do not easily get impressed by toronto restaurants but we had a very good experience last night and would def recommend this for a date night, work/private function, or just good food."}
{"text":"Mortons was a good restaurant.  The food was elegant the service was what I expected it to be.  The steak was really decent.  The only thing was whenn I was here my sister was accidentally served a hot dish of potatoes on her arm.  We did get free dessert but it was still bad."}
{"text":"After originally writing this review for Open Table, and not until it was completed was I informed that it had to be trimmed to a brief highlight before it would be posted. FAIL OPEN TABLE REVIEWS!

Morton's The Steakhouse, to the average joe, is a special occasion treat. It's prices are out of this world, especially when everything is a la carte. The restaurant-going public at large has gotten used to dining where choosing an entree entitles you to choose soup or salad, a vegetable and a starch. I've been here before, so I know not to expect anything with my steak besides a plate and flatware. Oh, and a napkin (and to be totally honest, bread and a glass, complete with water).

However, since the star of the show here is steak, it's almost sacrilege to choose anything else. C'mon, the speciality of the house is right there in the restaurant's name! I went with the \"Signature Cut New York Strip.\" To be totally frank, it is quite possibly the best steak on the face of the planet. It comes with a beautiful char, perfectly cooked to perfection, with nary a blemish to be found. You will be using your knife, but never to cut away grizzle or fat. How does a steak taste this good, chew this well, and not have any fat vein? Not quite sure, but Morty seems to have it down to a science. My companion had the \"Center Cut Prime Ribeye\" and she agreed with my assessment of perfection.

I saw many of the apps and sides being delivered to other tables, but after a soup (which I will describe in a moment) and steak, who could eat so much. The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail app looked tantalizing, old-school style on a wide-rimmed glass, complete with dry-iced fog effects. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese looked tempting, and were large enough to feed a group, but I can't attest to the flavor.

We started with a loaf of exceptional warm bread with flecks of toasted onion on the crust. It had a wonderful crumb, and I'd buy it from a bakery in a heartbeat. To begin I started with the Lobster Bisque, and my companion began with a Center-Cut Iceberg, or wedge salad. The wedge seemed perfectly adequate, inspire of it's Flintstones size. We both agreed that the Lobster Bisque was sublime! It had an incredible depth of lobster stock flavor. Speaking only for myself, though the bisque is the main attraction, the lobster island usually found floating in the middle is akin to the cherry topping an ice cream sundae. And I save it for the final sayonara spoonfuls. And in this case, it actually took down with it what went before. It was so overcooked as to be inedible, and rarely is ANYTHING inedible to moi. It had the mouthfeel of an underdone sponge, or perhaps soggy cotton balls. What a disappointment! I really couldn't tell if it was over or underdone.

So that last payoff, combined with the waiter's never-ending push to inflate the bill with dining accoutrements, were the only demerits from an otherwise exceptional meal!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time on our anniversary.  Maybe it's because we had to bring our kids with us, that they sat us in the very back.

{"text":"Catching up on my reviews while visiting the other side of the country.

OK - here is where I had my reception for my wedding - and i am NOT the least bit dissapointed.  The staff was extremely helpful, polite and \"over the top\".  The food was perfection.  I never thought I could get excited over a spinach salad - but let me tell you - to die for!  OH and get the shrimp cocktail - what a pleasant surprise to see it arrive - GREAT presentation.  Thank you Morton's!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and even better food.   Ask for Rolland for amazing service."}

{"text":"For my final stop for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, mumsie and I chose Morton's. This was my first experience and any Morton's and I think it converted this mostly-pescatarian into a full-blown meat eater.  We enjoyed similar selections from their Restaurant Week menu which included the Ahi Tuna Tower, 6 oz. filet, Key Lime Pie and Creme Brulee (I had the Pie). We started the meal with a couple of cool cocktails and warm, fresh-baked onion bread - both delicious.  The Ahi Tuna tower was a solid \"good,\" though I'd probably try one of their signature salads instead the next time.  Dessert was also very good, but the star of the meal was the Filet. This filet. I don't even know what to say. I moaned...too much during this meal.  But it was SOOOOOOO good. I'll go ahead and say it - it was the best damn piece of meat I've ever enjoyed. Done perfectly medium rare, it's something I'll be thinking about for weeks to come, I'm sure.  Though Restaurant Week is officially over, Morton's has a \"Summer Tasting\" menu which offers the same choices for $40.  My meal, including cocktail, rang it at $52 - a SIGNIFICANT savings over retail price.  Though the ambiance at Morton's leaves much to be desired, it's worth it to enjoy such quality food and service. Get there before the summer sale ends!"}
{"text":"I was happy with everything at Morton's. 

As to be expected with a chain everything was about 15% more expensive then it needed to be. A good wine list, and lots of Trophy Wine available for the Yorkville crowed to flash their cash and show of their general lack of knowledge of anything refined (it must be good if it's expensive, right?)

All in all the atmosphere was good and much better than the Keg; people actually put some effort into dressing-up for a decent evening. Those eating in the bar were much more casual but that is to be expected I suppose. 

Service was good, portions are large and often results in a lot of wasted a-la-carte side orders. Really, when you order borccolli do you need 12 pieces for one person? Baked potatoes were about 2x the size of my fist. If you control your alcohol consumption two people can get out for about $200 and change with appetizers, side orders, decent fillets a couple glasses of wine and a tip."}
{"text":"Came here on a business dinner with three other fellows. Steak was amazing, as were the fries and drinks. Great service all around! Loved the fact that it wasn't too busy."}

Steak was just ok, sides were far better than the steaks, across the board.  

Service was great, but no enough to cover the mediocre  meal..

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Morton's since they left what was to become part of the Arena District in Columbus several years ago (yeah, smart move guys!).

Upon arrival, we were asked if we'd like our jackets checked. We were promptly guided to our table, right by the open kitchen so we could observe. 

Our server, Kenny, exceeded all my expectations. He was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and his passion for food was clear. As it was our first time here, he walked us through the menu, specials, giving us more details about where the meat was sourced from, and even about ordering specific desserts ahead of time because it would take 30 mins to prepare. 

We decided upon having the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail (best I've ever had & very impressive item to order as it comes with dry ice) and bacon-wrapped scallops for appetizers.  ORDER THE SHRIMP COCKTAIL. It's delicious. Kenny even mentioned that having the scallops first followed by the crisp shrimp cocktail is the best order to have our appetizers in.

We ordered the French Onion Soup and he kindly had it split into 2 separate bowls without us asking. Not overly sodium-laden and very generous on the cheese. Could have used a bit more onions. 

By now, we were in trouble. We were full but our steaks arrived and they were perfect. I had the 7 oz. wagyu ribeye cap steak which was intensely rich and flavourful but a little too rich for my preference. Cooked & seasoned to perfection! My partner had the 16 oz. Ribeye steak and it was evenly charred and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The sides are separately ordered and we opted for bacon brussel sprouts. Nothing to write home about for the side but the steaks? Yes, you should come to eat here. 

Customer service really made it here along with fantastic quality food? It's a no-brainer.

The only thing that put me off? The gentleman pouring the water looked miserable. Each time I thanked him after he refilled my glass, he would just move onto th next glass or table without any acknowledgement."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Appetizers to the dessert was definitely worth skipping lunch for. 

My jumbo shrimps was as advertised. Large, firm and crunchy. My 22 oz. Chicago style steak was absolutely  juicy and filling. Although I struggled to finish, I think it best to be shared with someone or have the left overs brought home. Nothing  should be wasted!"}
{"text":"Worst steakhouse experience I have had to date! I  aware that my boyfriend and I went to enjoy Mortons for the first time during Queens Feast aka Restaurant Week which some may say that is why our experience was so poor. I believe this week is a way to win new patrons and to showcase what your restaurant does well. It may be a discounted price for Mortons but we are still spending our hard earned money. 

Our evening started out well, promptly greet by the host, who quickly found our reservation. We were slightly early so they requested that we wait for a few minutes in the bar. We may have waited 5 minutes before our table was ready. 

The decor is awful and the lighting feels like you are under fluorescent. I felt like I had walked into a mans bachelor pad with the black and silver ultra mod vibe. We were seated and given water from back waiters quickly. We discussed the menu, which we had already reviewed online before we picked which restaurant we wanted to try, therefore we knew what we wanted. 

We made a decision on a bottle of wine we wanted which we ordered from the manager. At this point we still had not seen our server. Once the server finally made his way to our table he was very pushy about trying to get us not to eat off the restaurant week menu. It was obvious he was disappointed that we were there to partake in RW. 

We finally made the server understand that we weren't going to do anything over than RW and wine. I ordered the tuna tartare as my starter which took a very long time to reach our table but was delicious. My second course was the Filet (Med Rare) prepared Oscar style with Bearnaise sauce on the side. We waited and waited... Then waited some more. 

There was a large private event which I am assuming took preciseness over us. Even with that being said our server just disappeared!!! I poured my own wine refills. We were sitting there wondering what was taking so long for our steaks and he didn't come by to offer an update. When the steak came out I cut into mine and it was Well Done!!!! My boyfriends steak was also over cooked, he ordered Rare and received MedWell! They took our steaks and then we waited again... Mine comes out covered in Bearnaise sauce!!! I requested sauce on the side because I don't like sauce on my steak, only on the asparagus. Eventually they bring my steal out correct. 

We ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were. Very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience. Our table was cleared and the server brings out the dessert which AGAIN was wrong! He rolled his eyes at us when I told him, this isn't our fault that he is getting our order wrong! 

Even at the discounted price we paid for Queens Feast we felt robbed. Our server still made good money from us, we never tip poorly but we felt he didn't deserve it. The experience was absolutely horrible and my boyfriend and I vowed to never visit again. 

I received an email, from the automated system, asking how our experience was so I wrote the manager telling him about our experience and he never even bothered answering me. 

If you want to enjoy a nice steak dinner take your money to Capital Grille or Flemings!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to dine at Morton's for our 5 year anniversary. My 1st experience at Morton's, some years back was not a good one (restaurant week) BUT yesterday was AMAZING!!!

Great service, attention to detail, absolutely delicious food (from the bread, all the way through to dessert). 

To start the dinner, we were seated at a nice, comfy big booth. Our waitress greeted us with congratulations, on the milestone anniversary.
Next she said that when ppl celebrate their anniversary at Morton's, they take pictures of the couple. Sure enough, camera ready, she took a few pictures of us and even framed it. The photo frame had a sweet message from the Morton's staff (brownie points!!).

They printed out a special menu, to celebrate our 5th anniversary, which included a complimentary dessert.

I went for the mixed grill, which included grilled salmon topped with a hefty serving of lump crab meat, shrimp alexander and grilled shrimp. It was DELICIOUS and a great amount of food. 

My husband had the Chicago bone in ribeye and we ordered a lobster mac to share. I'm not huge on steak but when I tell you..his steak was like butter and cooked to a perfect medium. I would actually order this for myself.
The lobster mac had huge chunks of lobster, very good.

When it came time for dessert, I wanted chocolate and he wanted bread pudding, dilemma lol. Morton's accommodated both of our desserts complimentary, instead of just one.

We left smiling, stuffed and anticipating our next return.

Morton's, thank you for such a memorable experience!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great wine selection. Cocktails were delicious (ceasars and martinis) Chop salad was delightful. Waitress was outstanding, efficient and quick. Alaskan crab legs. Massive, delicious, warm. Braised short rib tacos. Subtle and yummy. Asparagus side, great. Mashed potatoes, great. Skip the brocolli, group loved the matchstick fries. Molton cake fresh and yummy. Skip the mousse, just boring. My group had the oysters Rockefeller, good, not great apparently. But everyone had a rib eye or filet, all Raved. BTW party I was with was from the states except myself. Would recommend this place for business or special friends and family gathering."}
{"text":"I'm not going to beat around the bush with this one. I'm just going to straight up say it...NEVER come to this Mortons! 

Honestly, I've been to other Mortons (mostly the Orange County one) but I have never been satisfied. The only reason why my family and I went to Mortons again is because we had a gift card we wanted to use up. I am extremely disappointed with my visit here! 

We started off with a few salads. The chop salad and the Caesar salad. Not too bad. It was a little soggy, but not horrible. The nightmare came when they brought out the meat. I ordered the bone in rib-eye cooked medium. It tasted burnt and dry. I mean I'm paying 50 bucks for a rib-eye and it should be cooked better than it was. I felt I needed some sort of sauce and I feel a truly good piece of meat does not need this! Not only was just my meat burnt, but the other 5 people I was with also felt the meat was overcooked and burnt. We were looking at the main chef (they have a huge opening in the kitchen) and I could see the other pieces of meat were just like this. Some he was throwing away because it could not be served. Maybe because it was super busy (there was a wedding reception) that the meat was like this, but its still no excuse! 

As for the side dishes, we ordered the sauteed mushrooms, macaroni and cheese, and hash browns. None of these side dishes stood out for me. The mac and cheese was overly cooked and too strong of a flavor. It was pretty bad. The sauteed mushrooms were alright, nothing special and the hash browns were Denny's status. I would go with some other sides besides the ones mentioned above if you must absolutely come here. 

Dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and apple pie. You must tell them you want these items when you order because it takes 30 minutes to prepare. The chocolate cake is definitely worthwhile. The warm chocolate inside the cake melts in your mouth and is paired perfectly with vanilla ice cream. The apple pie was pretty great as well, but not as good as the chocolate cake. Fresh and warm! Just how I like it. 

I would highly recommend going to another steakhouse such as Ruth Chris, Flemings, or Mastros if you are interested in a steakhouse."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for dinner on the weekend and have had no issue with not having a reservation, although I would recommend one for you'd like to make sure you have a cozy oval booth for a date. The cocktail and wine list are great and the cocktails are on the side of a heavy pour. This delicious huge round mound of onion bread with butter is served to all tables just be sure not to fill up on bread! The tuna sashimi I appetizer is my favorite and I have ordered scallops as well as steak here and entrees are delicious. I tried the coco late cake for dessert and it was rich and creamy, but very large so I suggest sharing or taking it to go for a later time. It is pricey, but a great place for a date. The interior is beautiful and classy. They have a few table top area to eat at the bar as well as bar stools if that is more your thing."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite steak house in the city.

Yes yes I know others are more expensive or the décor isn't as trendy as others but this is a classic elegant old school steakhouse where everything is done right. I also love how this place isn't pretentious like some other steak houses. It has a more cozy vibe. Jeans and a T Shirt? No problem. They still treat you like a human being.

First off service is great. Always friendly and eager to make you happy.

The large onion roll they start off with is always warm, super fresh and delicious.

I usually skip the appetizers and go right to the steak. Me and my bro always split the filet and the New York strip.  Cooked Medium Rare Plus.  That's right PLUS. Just a little more then medium rare. Steaks are always cooked to perfection. Sweet salty and soft inside with char on the outside.

You always have the get the fries on the side. They are simply the best fries In the city. Trust me I have tried them all.

Always money well spent and if it wasn't for my cholesterol I would be here weekly."}
{"text":"Went to Morton's for a special occasion and left disappointed. Salads were good, service was great and sides were delicious. However I was expecting a great Medium temp filet and it was way over cooked to a well done. Waitress saw the steaks and rushed over to apologize and took them away. Unfortunately the second time around both filets were raw with cold red center. So rather than sending them back we boxed them up. So pretty much had side orders n salad for dinner. Then the highly anticipated lava cake n cream brûlée arrived. Lava cake was lava less :( overbooked and like a brownie. Brûlée was great. Overall I was looking for a good steak and chocolate cake and didn't get to enjoy either. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Our anniversary restaurant! This year was our 11 year wedding anniversary. Details made it special. Warmly greeted by everyone on staff to wish us happy anniversary. Anniversary menu printed for us. Impeccable service. Mike from NY was our incredible waiter. Delicious creme' brulee for dessert. The ambience is why Morton's is my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The best Steak House in Toronto! The steak was amazing, cooked perfectly. The servers interact and even explain how it's cooked. I cant begin to say how much i enjoyed this restaurant. The star is the truffle fries though and i rarely ever eat fries! Loved it!"}
{"text":"The best thing about tonight's long dining experience was bartender Mark.  Merry Christmas!  We ordered the Morton salad and it was next to tasteless..13.00 Salad. From when we ordered it too when we received it was at least 45 minutes.... they also asked us if we wanted bread and that did not come for at least 40 minutes but bartender Mark took blame for not getting it so no problem.. we ordered the bone in ribeye around $61 to share. The meat was medium to medium well we ordered it medium rare it was warm at best when we received it... no one ever asked us if it was cooked to our liking. Yes we should have said something but we were pretty hungry and fed up at that point. We also order the onion rings which had too much breading on them but not bad tasting. We saw the manager and maybe the maître d' walking around not once did they stop by to ask us how our food was.  (I think they were afraid to ask Us) As we left the restaurant one of them open the door for us the other one stood there and not once did they ask us how our food or dining experience was. They were more worried about closing down and getting the heck out of there then servicing the customers.  One gentleman/customs  had a run to the drugstore to get his seven-year-old daughter some medicine and they gave him flack about holding his beer in the cooler while he ran to get her medicine. Really?  We came home and rode up in the elevator with a gentleman who had McDonald's food and we were jealous!  On a positive note the  bartender understanding are unhappiness And bought us a round of drinks which we were very appreciative of!  Morton's 3 strikes and your out!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! We made reservations for last night at 630pm, we arrived early and were still seated immediately! Our server was amazing. We both ordered the filet and lobster tail. Our filet were both way over cooked but still the best filet we have ever had. Lobster was delicious. Good portions per meal. Both ordered a side; we got the jumbo baked potato and the bacon& onion Mac n cheese. The sides are quite large. They do not skimp out on the toppings for the jumbo baked potato either! They really tried to push dessert on us but we were very full by then. Overall experience was great! We opted out for the valet and parked about 1 or 2 blocks down at the parking garage for $5. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I love a good steak every once in a while and when me and the then-BF received a gift card for Morton's I was looking forward to a nice evening out.

If you go there for ambiance, you will be disappointed.  It is lit brighter than a high school cafeteria, and the tables are very closely crowded together.  At a place like Tessaro's where you're paying seven bucks for a burger, this is to be expected, but a place like Morton's?  Come on!

The server was good and brought out the different cuts of meat and provided helpful suggestions for pairing our dinners with a nice glass of wine.  Most people already know this, but everything is a la carte.  So everything--a baked potato, a salad, a vegetable, etc.--is extra and on the expensive side for what you get.

I ordered a ribeye and it was perfectly cooked medium/medium well.  I ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad and it was excellent with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  My dinner companion got a filet and he said it was good but it I thought it was quite small.  I believe he got creamed spinach as a side and we split a side of mashed potatoes.

I believe the bill, with the tip, came to over $150.  Was it a good dinner?  Yes, but not great, and far from outstanding or memorable.  Was it worth $150?  No, in my opinion.  If I spend that much money, I'm looking for the \"whole package\"--great service, soft lighting, a bit of room from the next door diners, etc.  

I'd give the food three stars, service three stars, atmosphere zero stars, and value for the money one star."}
{"text":"This has just become my favorite happy hour in town!  Not being one to load on protein, the filet trio from the bar menu, a side of grilled asparagus and glass of red is just perfect portions.  Our order is perfectly cooked to temperature requested.  The balsamic glaze on the asparagus is just enough to play with and not against the food.

We've tried other items on the bar menu including the garlic fries and crab, artichoke, spinach dip.  I give both items 5 stars, my benchmark being east coast boardwalk fries and crab dip.  Authenticity gets upgraded by the chef at Morton's.  

The atmosphere is true steakhouse, dark and loungy.  A nice respite from the super hot summer outside.  See you there!"}
{"text":"You know when you go to a higher-end steakhouse only to be disappointed by the steak?  That is NOT the case with this Morton's.

Had a quiet dinner on a weeknight.  Staff was courteous and friendly, decor was comfortable albeit lighting a bit dim, and the music was a little too elevator like.

For the food, I ordered the Cajun Ribeye and my guest ordered a Filet with shrimp and scallops. My Ribeye was outstanding.  They nailed it and I was so happy as so many steakhouses have disappointed I'd almost given up on them. We also ordered spinach with mushrooms, Brussels sprouts and a giant spud. The reason for the 4-stars and not 5 is that the potato was overcooked, the Brussels Sprouts were a bit too soggy and the music was...meh. $85 bottle of wine plus the aforementioned items was $250 + tip.  Overall though it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Typical Mortons nothing extraordinary about the food, but the staff was awesome and very friendly, if not it would have just been 2, maybe 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Morton's is \"A-OK\" good...but honestly, I was expecting more.

The service is what you'd expect at this type of establishment. The manager and maitre d' were top notch. Our server seemed a little green, but overall the experience was professional.

The atmosphere is nice. Slightly more relaxed than some other high-end steakhouses, but classy nonetheless. They have some Rat Pack music playing softly in the background, which adds to the \"swingin\" vibe. [No, not that type of swinging.]

As far as the food, it was good...but we weren't very wowed by most of it. The one standout entree was Morton's signature cut New York Strip; it had such an amazing flavor. No Bearnaise or Au Poivre needed. The New York Strip may tempt me back. However, the Filet Mignon was not as impressive. It wasn't bad; actually it was in fact good; but it was also a step down from Filet Mignons I've had at other steakhouses. I don't like mentioning competitor's names...but let's just say you wouldn't have to drive very far at all to get a better Filet Mignon.

The Colossal Shrimp Cocktail was good. And they do mean \"colossal\" too; those suckers are big. I prefer a spicier cocktail sauce, but the sweet (almost bbq tasting) cocktail sauce they use was interesting. The Center Cut Iceberg Salad was tasty, as was the Sliced Beefsteak Tomato Salad. The wine that was recommended was not very good -- which I wouldn't take fault with if it wasn't recommended. And steer clear of the Prime Rib; it was GIGANTIC (like they took it from a Brontosaurus)...but it was also completely flavorless and a little tough.

Overall, the food and service at Morton's is good. And if I hadn't experienced better in my life, I might be tempted to give them more than 3 stars. However, I hold these type of \"swanky\" steakhouses to a higher standard. It should be more than good; it should be great. When you spend over $100 per person, you expect to have one helluva gastronomical experience. And that didn't happen here at Morton's."}
{"text":"If your are looking for a GREAT steak but don't mind spending the extra money then look no further.  I give Morton's 4 stars only for the fact that its very expensive.  The food is deff 5 stars.  Ive been to this location 5 times and each time i have left extremely satisfied.  I highly recommend making reservations and using the valet parking as its the same cost to park in a parking lot.  Service is hands down some of the best services I have ever seen in almost all my restaurant experiences.  My usual is the Cajun Rib Eye steak.  Its huge and always cooked to perfection.

When my wallet allows me to I will deff be back to eat here"}
{"text":"Update: they did message to say sorry so I add another star back and also I feel like their steak was good just the dessert was kinda... As a steakhouse, I think they deserve 4stars:) 

The bread was huge but the quality was just just just okay and so as the butter. Not much surprised. The red wine I order was Seven Falls, Cabernet Sauvignon, Wahluke Slope, 2013. It was good as expected. The porterhouse was exactly what I expected and it was good with juicy and tender inside with crispy surface. Thumb up . For the temperature was just right which is rare for the porterhouse since it has a bone in the middle where it usually tends to be a bit easier to overlook. However, the plate for the steak was not hot enough. Just a bit warm. The side I got was the lobster macaroni and it was fascinating. The service and ambience was good as well. I also ordered a dessert which was a piece of cheesecake with different kinds of berries. The berries were good and fresh. However, the cake itself was really okay.  One last thing, they didn't clean up the table for me to have the cheesecake after I ordered the dessert which was kinda awkward for this kinda of steakhouse."}
{"text":"I've been to Morton's here at home (St. Louis), but we made a trip to this one to celebrate my Mom's birthday while we were in Vegas. The food was definitely comparable to the one here. I especially love the spinach with button mushrooms and the shrimp Alexander. The Morton's in Vegas offerred a new menu item: Chilean Sea Bass with a mango chutney. So good. I hope they offer it at the location here soon!"}
{"text":"Celebrating our 20th anniversary and enjoyed every minute of it here. Our waiter Gabriel was awesome. We both had the mix grill. Mine was crab cake  and my wife had the 6oz filet. Thank first filet was dry but, they fixed another one to perfection.
We had a wonderful time and will return. Wish they were open for lunch."}
{"text":"We went here for the first night of Restaurant Week.  The $50 prix fixe menu helped take the sting out of Morton's high prices.  I had some of my favorite dishes off that menu - lobster bisque, filet, au gratin potatoes, and key lime pie.  Those items would have cost about $100 off the regular menu, so the Restaurant Week menu was a very good deal.  But somehow these dishes just didn't \"pop.\"  There was nothing particularly wrong with them, but there was nothing spectacular either.

I will say that I have rarely seen a restaurant that tries so hard to satisfy its customers.  The wait staff and the manager were very attentive.  The service was good (at least until the end of the meal when the big crowds arrived and slowed things down).  But it still comes down to this - there are lots of high end steak houses in Las Vegas with better food and lower prices.  We have a list of our favorites, and Morton's is not going on that list."}
{"text":"Had their 'bar bites' for my birthday dinner last night with my family. Martin was our server and did a fantastic job. The service was great, food and drinks were delectable, and the atmosphere was exactly what we wanted. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"They charged our table for the birthday cake... What restaurant does that? Other than that the steaks, sides, and beverages were all good. Our porter house was rare when asked for medium rare. Maybe the grill masters are afraid to overcook the steaks. The menus had been personalized to the birthday person's name, nice touch. Service was mediocre. Waitress had a tinge of attitude which was irritating. I wouldn't go back on my initiative, but I would join others there. 3 stars for medium value to $ spent."}
{"text":"I have been to several different Morton's locations and have had truly enjoyable experiences.  Unfortunately, this location did not live up to our expectations.

We realize that this is a town that caterers to tourists, but the attire of the other diners was far more casual than we have experience in other good restaurants in town. In some cases, it looked like people had rolled out of bed and wandered in.  

The service was very good and attentive. The food however was merely good, and, except for the Escargot, it was not outstanding. 

We will go back and have drinks and Escargot at the bar, but not stay for dinner."}
{"text":"I have to say, the three star rating threw me before coming for dinner here.  Morton's has always been one of my favorite places to dine, and I've been to many across the country.  I'm happy to report that I wasn't disappointed at the Kierland location.  I like this place because it's old school without trying to be.  The kind of place where you're waiter has been working there for the last 10 years, drinks come stiff, and all the food is top quality.  

We started with a half dozen oysters and a glass of champagne.  Our next course was the crab cake which was all lump crab, and went well with the mayo sauce they serve it with. After that we tried their new bacon steak which was absolute maple porky heaven.  Next we switched to white wine and split an order of the Chicken Christopher, which IMO is one of the absolute best chicken dishes known to man.  For the next course we split a perfectly cooked medium rare 12 oz filet with sautéed spinach and mushrooms and a glass of Shatter Grenache.  And finally to close out the meal we had a Grand Mariner soufflé and sabayon with after dinner drinks and espresso.  

It was the absolute perfect evening, and the Uber cab ride home was an excellent way to ensure we got home safely.  I guess to sum Morton's up, come here to have a great meal, with excellent staff. Eat the steak, not the steak tacos. Don't expect to leave here with a bill less than $150 per head with drinks and tip, and you've got the makings of a great evening.  On the other hand, if you don't want to spend the money, and want to get the bargain, head up the street to Charlston's, your meal will be a third of the price and the quality half as good."}
{"text":"Went here twice. The first time I went with my girlfriend and the experience was great! Our waitress was very pleasant, helpful and prompt. I ordered the steak which was amazing. The second I went with a larger group and the experience was complete opposite. Our waiter did not seem to know what he was doing and went my guests asked for non-meat options he seems very annoyed as if everyone is supposed to love meat. I understand it's a steakhouse but he should have been more patient and accommodating to his customers. The food also was not as good the second time. I would still go back to this place but for their prices, they need to make sure good food and service is consistent."}
{"text":"I really hate to be the voice of dissent, but I gotta call it how I see it and taste it. Hubby and I were really split between giving Morton's a 2 or 3 star but the fact that neither one of us would return here solidifies my rating. Considering this place is $$$$ the expectation is high for top service, top quality food AND great ambiance. 

Made reservations online without a hitch. Found free neighborhood street parking (9pm-midnight) which saved us from the $15 valet parking fee. The host seated the two of us in a cozy booth for four. The dining area is decorated in dark colors with dim lighting and soft music, but even though the setting was intimate, the noise from the bar and the loud patrons in the dining room did not make for a romantic evening (late dinner Wednesday night). There is a dress code mentioned on their website, so I came in a dress and my hubby wore his suit. Looking around there were some in similar outfits, but others were in jeans, tshirts and tennis shoes. Our waiter started off cheerful and attentive but hubby noticed his demeanor change after he realized that we would not be ordering any wine, hmmmm. 

We ordered the following:
- Morton salad - too much mayo and egg which didn't compliment our meal at all.
- Porterhouse Steak (doesn't come with any sides) was tender and flavorful but I've had more juicy steaks elsewhere. The sear could have been better and check out those fissures!
- 6oz Filet Mignon (tender not as well seasoned as the porterhouse, good thing I ordered the foie gras- Cognac butter to go with it) with 2 bacon wrapped scallops (tasted better after using the sweet sauce that accompanied it) and 3 shrimp (again tasted better with the sauce that accompanied it) and three spears of asparagus (tender crisp, and delicious).
- Matchstick Parmesan Truffle Fries were overcooked and hard and the truffle flavor was too powerful and overwhelming. 
- Morton's \"Legendary\" Hot Chocolate Cake with a caramel drizzle topped with powdered sugar and raspberries with a side of vanilla ice cream. It was decadent but with a price tag of about $15, I expected better tasting chocolate and vanilla ice cream to make it legendary. 
- Complimentary onion bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside and came with butter that was bland (maybe they used unsalted butter): nothing special.

No disrespect to the owners, apparently there are many loyal patrons who feel differently than I do. If you're one of those patrons, more power to you, different strokes for different folks. There's no right or wrong in Yelp reviews just opinions, so this review is mine. 

NOTE: If you ask if they do anything special for a birthday, they will bring out their \"Legendary\" Hot Chocolate Cake for you topped with a candle. They'll even take a picture (using your camera/phone) of you, then charge you for the dessert. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not worth $250 for 2 people. There are way better steakhouses on the strip like Cut and delmonico. If you don't like the strip then go to Flemings, way fresher food for half of the price."}
{"text":"we went to dinner at mortons steak house to celebrate my BFF moms birthday and her celebration to life at Mortons Steak House. we had a great dinner. What i didnt like about Mortons was the price for 1 and the crazy thought of no side dishes. also another thing i didnt enjoy is that when the waitress delivered our food ahe is asking if we wanted desert? wow im glad we didnt order any deserts because we were all so full. Sides would of been great to have with our meal but nothing was necessary considering how full we all were. my friend and her husband ahared a salad and a bake potato i did like how they separated the potato for the both to share and also the salad was served individual to share together on there own plates. i enjoyed that. The streak was kinda burnt on the outside but was cooked perfect in the inside."}
{"text":"Like most Morton's, nice environment and good food. And as expected, it can be a bit pricey depending on order. Strongly recommend their desserts! Not a big steak fan myself, but I did like their filet mignon. The service was ok, but was certainly not among the best in town."}
{"text":"Great for private dining events and the steaks are out of this world.  The service, as usual is way above average and the prices are too - but for a fancy treat occasionally, great place.  They do run daily happy hour specials for less expensive items and drinks, so stop in after work.  Valet is \"free\" like all places around town and it is convenient."}
{"text":"We have made this restaurant our destination of choice for our past three anniversary's. We have been loyal Morton customers for years. We have been Morton VIP for several years as well. I call the GM number as requested and make reservations. The past two years they have had to scramble last minute to make a custom menu and fancy up the table. Don't know if Daniel passes on this is an anniversary celebration. Anyway, the food is always spectacular and service is better than any other steakhouse. We enjoyed the tomatoes and blue cheese salad to start followed by cajun ribeye for me and small fillet for my wife. We share the matchstick fries. We finished the meal with carrot cake. Execution of the meal was spot on. The only reason I did not give them a 5+ star was I figured out after we left I was charged too much for my dinner and they did not seem to know it was a special occasion dinner. The mistake on the bill was only around 12.00 and something that will not keep us from coming back. In fact, when you take in consideration the comps they gave us, we were ahead. Big props to Assistant GM Mark and to our server Gabriel for outstanding service and their kindness."}
{"text":"We go to Morton's about 8 times a year because we like the food and how we are treated. We had reservations on Saturday night and the place was pretty full. What surprised us is that it is a whole new Morton's. They have opened the bar to more of the restaurant and got rid of the old wood and clubby feel to have a more modern, classy feel. If you like steak or seafood try the new Morton's. Still some work to be done but a gorgeous restaurant. More updated booths, new wine wall, new everything. They are also opening for lunch in a week or two. Our food was great also."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best places to eat in Charlotte. The food and service were great. I took my wife for her birthday and she enjoyed every minute of it."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Vegas at least once a year.   We go to Morton's every trip.   It's consistently good.   We usually split a big steak then do salads, and sides.    The steaks are very good - quality meat, and cooked perfectly.   Wait staff is very courteous and professional.   It's still an expensive meal but compared with the prices of the streak houses on the strip or in the big Casino's it seems fair.  For comparison, our other favorite steak restaurants are  - Daniels, The Metropolitan Bar and Grill, and Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"All I can say is I love this place!  5 star stuff.   Go, its stellar!   National chain doing it right!   Bravo!"}
{"text":"Now I know why the tables have sleeping piggy lights on each table it is funny since they don't serve pork. (they are making fun of the guest because you feel that way after eating here)

A Giant whole squishy onion bread comes out to you right away with HARD butter. (this is enough for 6 people)

We both ordered the most reasonably priced 3 course dinners upping one to a rib-eye ($9extra) The spring special till 9-30-11 $45 a special that is no longer on this location's web-site but you can still get.

Out comes our wedge salad (HOLY BEEP!) a whole trimmed head of lettuce (am I a pig?) all dressed up. (this can feed 4 people ) I picked blue cheese dressing and thought it seemed very heavy with lots of mayo not to mention many oz of good blue cheese.

I get my small (not really small) filet and it was good so I have to give at least 3 stars ,so was the rib-eye also cooked nice.

The potato is some sort of Giant Monster potato that can feed 4 people but it was burnt of the bottom and we had asparagus that were cooked nice however the balsamic glazing wasn't too tasty.

Our specials came with this giant chocolate mousse that we both found to be extra heavy and not smooth but rich with chocolate.

I noticed most service was very good,ours was OK with our server maybe just not into being there. (a fluke) we didn't get the Morton's educational speech with the cart or and all and was only checked on by server when taking first bite of steak.

We had a $100 gift card and still spent close to $100 with drinks tax tip ordering the least expensive dinners so it is fair to say for a couple plan on $200 up UP and UP!

The steaks really were very good but the rest over all OK or meh I had better? and oink OINK ZZzzzzzzzz"}
{"text":"Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.
They are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. 
Gone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.
I just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America."}
{"text":"Our server was kind, and very attentive.
The atmosphere is nice but not overly \"stuffy\"

I enjoyed the complementary bread, and large food portions.

The seafood that we enjoyed you could tell was very fresh and high quality. 

Valet parking out front has a $9 convenience charge which is totally worth not searching for a parking spot downtown.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or just enjoy a night out in the city."}
{"text":"Celebrated the New Year and appreciate the full menu still offered during this packed night. 

The Mixed Grill seems like a steal and can't imagine why you wouldn't go for the surf & turf offering. 
The 6oz filet was perfectly prepared as well as the bacon wrapped scallops. The shrimp were a little over done and therefore dry. Also on the plate was just the right amount of asparagus to say you had some greens. 

I did also enjoy their chopped salad with greens, avocado, cucumber, onions and blue cheese in a vinaigrette. 

The sides we tried were okay nothing to write home about. 

They were crazy busy so I won't complain about the slow service. 

The remodel does deserve note however. They opened the bar and added much needed seating in this area. They also lightened up the walls with a nice shiny wallpaper. Very rich and well deserved update. 


Thanks Mortons!"}
{"text":"The service is great, that's the only reason I'm giving the 2nd star. The quality of the steak I had was the same I could get at a Texas Roadhouse. I was disgusted when I turned around and seen the chefs prep a steak that came out of a vacuum sealed bag. You can't age a steak 28 days, like they claim, in a vacuum bag. It looked like the same steak that Omaha Steaks are mailed in. This place is way overpriced for the quality you get. Their drinks aren't anything special for the price. Save your money"}
{"text":"Went here for our second time last night (New Years Eve) and had an even better experience the second time around.  Our server, Tara, really made the dining experience great for us.  She checked in with us before we had to look for her, but not so much as to be an annoyance, and she made wonderful suggestions as to drink choices, the seasonal pineapple drink, I forget the name, was amazing and at her recommendation.  I also mentioned that the steak I had last time was a bit too well done and she made sure the cook made it medium as I requested and it was perfect when it came back.  One of the best steaks I've had.  All in all, this was a wonderful New Years experience and we will definitely be coming back some time in the new year!"}
{"text":"Chose Morton's for a night out with my husband and we will not be coming back. The food was cold and we expected better service. Definitely not worth the money we paid. Still giving it 3 stars for the atmosphere and the food was still tasty, just on the cold side. Next time we are in the area we will be trying another high-end restaurant."}
{"text":"Lovely place for a business meeting or with a date. The ambiance is great for a romantic dinner but just as good for a professional gathering. I've been here 5 times in the last 3 years and have not had a single bad experience. Their service is top notch! Once you're seated, you usually get a presentation on what's available. The server would bring over a cart and showcase the fresh meats and vegetables they are serving that day.

As you may already know, this place ain't cheap! So, I usually come here when they have some sort of special going on. A few times a year, they feature a three course steak and seafood special for 2 for $120 or so. Its typically one appetizer to share, a choice of steak (filet mignon cut) with seafood (rather its crab cake, scallops, or shrimp), and two desserts (usually key lime pie or chocolate cake). Their steaks come out perfect every time I've been here. The steaks are flavorful and seasoned just right. They are grilled and then baked from what I can tell (you can see the their kitchen area). I also had their shrimp alexander which is basically grilled jumbo shrimp. The shrimp is flavorful and fresh (has a crunch to them). Their lobster tail is pretty good as well. The meal includes bread and dipping oil. The bread they serve is amazingly good. I usually pack it home!

Would I say this is the best steak/$? No, but their service makes up for their lack in value.

Oh, if you're on a date, (and if its going well...) you can ask to get your picture taken! They'll print it out and put it in a frame for you to take home :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for valentines dinner and ordered the porterhouse for two. Carlos was amazing, as he presented our steak to us, cut perfectly into our portions, he magically cut mine into a heart shaped delight! Although I love my steaks Rare +, the charbroiled exterior was a nice change, as my meat was still cooked perfectly inside. They offer some yummy onion bread, and our asparagus and sour cream mashed potatoes all were delicious! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Morton's in San Francisco and San Jose, and now Phoenix.  They are all slightly different in layout and ambiance, but the experience in Phoenix was very different.

The restaurant is an open dining room and dimly lit.  I prefer a less cafeteria-like experience personally, but we had a party of 9, so it wasn't terrible.  A bit cramped in getting around, however.  At other locations, it is rare to see people wearing shorts and T-shirts, but it was not the case here.  I know that there isn't a stated dress code, but it definitely contributes to a more casual atmosphere.  Several of our party were wearing jackets, a couple were wearing short-sleeved button-front shirts, but none of us were wearing shorts or T-shirts.

We were helped by a two-person server team, but I don't recall being told this, so at first it seemed as though two servers were competing for our table.  It was a little off-putting.  The servers were friendly, but there was something about the way they treated us that was too familiar: small things that don't seem to matter to most, but upon reflection, you realize the cost of the food and you kind of lament the lack of care taken here or there.  For example, calling for attention by saying, \"Hey guys!\"  When we were ordering, one server came and began the process, and then the other one showed up and asked which way the first was working so that they could work the opposite way around the table.

The food was good, but not excellent.  One of our party had a center-cut ribeye that was really, really fatty and grisly.  Ribeyes are typically a little fattier than, say, a New York strip, but this was ultra fatty.  It did not even look appetizing.  Others had far better steaks, so they're capable of doing a good medium.  The drinks were good, but not top of the class.  The signature drinks were better looking than the standard cocktails, as I would expect, but when I ordered a Manhattan, the server asked what kind of bourbon I wanted (it should be made with rye) and had a (small-m) maraschino cherry for garnish (the sickly neon red kind).  Maybe I'm a snob, but I would have hoped that Morton's would have Maraschino or brandied cherries for garnish.

The bathroom wasn't well tended, and over the course of the 2 hours we were there, it got progressively disordered and the counters stayed wet longer than they should have.  Small thing, but hey, I'm at the perfect height to walk away from most wet bathroom counters looking like I had an accident if I bump into it the wrong way.

Overall, I'd say it would be more disappointing if I were on a date or a business meeting, but our group was mostly forgiving of these issues.  I'll probably try harder next time I'm in town to get to Durant's or another local steakhouse to try it out."}
{"text":"Great steak, sides, and desert but I would still give the nod to N9NE or Ruth's Chris if given a choice"}
{"text":"Tom was awesome!  The food was incredible.  The crab cake appetizer was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Ok.... this place is just excellent. The food is great, the service is outstanding and they really set the bar pretty high for others. Although it's pricey, you get what you pay for and I feel that the return on investment was worth it. My boyfriend is more of a \"Jack In The Box\" kind of guy, so you can imagine my surprise when he raved about our experience there. I've yet to attend one of their many events, but plan to in the near future. Get on their mailing list!"}
{"text":"I have dined at all of the Morton's in the US.  This one is by far the very best!  The best chefs, the best cuts of beef, the best service!  The staff were absolutely the best! It was a great experience and I will definitely be coming back my next trip to Vegas ! Good Job!"}
{"text":"Morton's is an amazing place! They are top notch. From setting up a reservation to my experience once I entered the restaurant. The place is beautiful, the location is great, and the staff is even better. 


I went there for a special occasion, and was seated in a special half moon style table. It was private enough, but provided a special view of the restaurant to enhance my overall experience. Our waitress was amazing. Very professional and attended to our every need. The food was delicious and the dessert was over the top! 

Our waitress knew just what to help us order. The management staff checked on every table to make sure all customers were getting the best service and quality possible. 

I highly recommend Morton's to anyone visiting downtown Cleveland. Bring your appetite, and prepare to be served!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at this location for a work-related event that was held in the back room, and I have to say, our server (RON) was the absolute BEST server I've ever had! The food, wine, and ambiance were all top notch, but he really made the experience 10x's better than it already was. He was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable, and I will be sure to suggest this location (and Ron) for our next event!"}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! GO TO HYDE PARK!!!  My husband and I took my parents to dinner at Morton's downtown pittsburgh .  (We normally go to Hyde Park but we had gift cards to Morton's that we have never used from our wedding).  We all ordered the 6oz filet, the shrimp. And scallop meal for $59.  We all ordered the filet to be prepared medium.   All of the filets were overdone. ..... like well done .   My mom actually had to send her filet back it was so over cooked.  The shrimp and scallops were very small.  The taste of the filet had nothing on Hyde park.   I think the food at Outback Steakhouse or Applebee's is better than Morton's.  I would actually prefer McDonald's to Morton's.  This is our second time there and our last.   I was not impressed the first time and the food was so horrible this time WE WILL NEVER GO BACK.   Even the salad and sides do not compare to the Hyde park.   We have dined at Hyde park ,Eddie merlots and the palm steakhouse in Vegas.   Morton's is by far the worst high end steak house I have ever been too. Service was slow.  Food and drinks way over priced.  Sincerely, a very disappointed customer. Oh yeah and the bill for 4 people was $500.  My best advise..... go to Hyde park or Eddie merlots if you are craving a high end steak house in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my family on Wednesday night, there were 7 adults & my 3 month old baby. From the minute we stepped in the door, the service was great. The food was really delicious too, but the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Took our company and clients to dinner.  The food was great.  The manager Tom was awesome."}
{"text":"It's difficult to believe this is the same restaurant that was once considered fine dining. There was nothing fine about my last visit unless you count the freaks that came out that night filling the restaurant as entertainment.  I kept waiting to be told I was on Candid Camera. Sadly, it didn't come to fruition.

As soon as we told our server we were there for restaurant week, she went from a pleasant, smiling server to one of those Goons from Popeye cartoons void of personality. My cocktail (in the smallest glass I've ever seen) was WARM. My date sent his back it was so bad.  It was corrected. But he got billed for the drink and then additionally he was upcharged for the correction on the check. Our entrees were not spectacular, but good. We \"ordered\" Lyonnaise potatoes but received dry breakfast home fries that failed to match Bob Evans quality. By definition, Lyonnaise potatoes are thin sliced and pan fried, not cubed and so dry you need to rub your throat to choke them down like a dog taking pills.

The only positive I can offer about this visit is my water glass never went lower than 2 inches without being refilled continuously. I was thankful considering my 4 sip warm cocktail was $14.  I would have had to take out a loan if I didn't drink the water.

I love upscale dining. But this wasn't it. You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant.  My blood pressure can't take that sort of irritation."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Morton's for years and have always enjoyed it. This past Sunday was mine and my husbands first trip to Morton's in Scottsdale and wow was it a disappointment. I was craving a salad with some steak which I had at Morton's in Philadelphia the week before while on a business trip so we looked up steakhouses and saw that this location only had 3 stars but thought it had to be a mistake.... it wasn't. Not only did they charge for a entire salad and entire filet without informing us prior but my husbands dinner was completely overcooked and very tough. The other locations I have visited will only charge for a add on steak to a salad otherwise if I was properly informed that for some reason this location treats everything out of the norm I would have just ordered a steak and sides to actually get my money's worth. We mentioned this first to the bartender that we were charged for an entire steak thinking it was a mistake and was informed that she \"had to just picked a steak for the salad\". If I was going to get an entire steak off the menu I would have appreciated taking my own pick. I even called the manager, Adam, to inform him of the mistake and he basically told me to buzz off and that's how they run the show there. I would heed the warnings of the reviews for this location and go to Dominicks of Mastros if you want good steak and proper service."}
{"text":"Once a cozy restaurant with its intimate atmosphere, well, that Morton's no longer exists.
The Morton's we visited last night looks more like the interior of a jumbo jet. 
With its many newly added tables, it reminded me of walking onto a 747 and peering down the aisle at the countless number of seats. 

The wall that once separated the bar from the main dining room, like Elvis, has left the building. This along with the pony wall in the center of the room - the one with all the magnum sized bottles of wine that used to sit atop.
These dividers were important to me, at least architecturally speaking anyway. 
They created a sense of space and separation, making for a more intimate dining and drinking experience. 

Also gone is the server's presentation of menu items. 
Yes, the buffet cart with the many cuts of beef and the live lobster trying to make a break for it is no longer. But then it makes sense. 
When you squeeze that many tables into a small room, there's no room to navigate the cart between tables. 
In fact, I couldn't even squeeze my big ass in between the tables without feeling like
I was going to knock someone's fork right into their eye socket!

I guess I'm just getting old, not wanting to sit within earshot of neighboring tables, listening in to insanely stupid conversations, or smell their lobster dinner continually wafting in my direction - or the old woman next to me whose parfum smelled like RAID, ant and roach killer.

Food and service are the same; excellent in a word.

I probably won't be returning anytime soon.
I need a more intimate atmosphere - one that allows me to rip on other diners without their hearing me do so. 
The guy next to us looked like a barn owl, and I couldn't say anything until leaving, but by then, it was too late. My wife never saw him.

We could have gotten a really good laugh out that weird looking unit had we been sitting in one of the old booths in the center of the room.

Yes, I always make fun of people uglier than me. 
Deal with it."}
{"text":"I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. 
The environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great selection of steak and seafood. Not a place you go without increasing the limit on that Visa a little. We got the special salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert. After all was said and done we paid a little less than$200.00 for for an amazing meal and two glasses of wine for two people. It was worth every penny. We both got the Fillet Oskar, crab cakes,  asparagus, mashed potatoes, cheese cake, and the Merlot. It was a cozy 1940's type atmosphere with dim lights and attentive wait staff. It made me feel fancy :)"}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse. Consistent in each of their locations. The one in Kierland is no exception. Excellent meal and great service. Wonderful steak and seafood."}
{"text":"Guess you have to drop $40 here to get the waitstaff's attention. The bar was busy, but do I have to remind you to get my drink, which you forgot? Also, that my dish didn't come out at all?"}
{"text":"4* Morton's

The filet sandwiches not so much
The short rib tacos were delicious

Good food and beverage service
Killer chocolate layer cake"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took my mom and I out for a special dinner and we had the most AMAZING SERVICE AND FOOD!  Our waiter was beyond wonderful.  It is so nice to experience genuinely wonderful people in a restaurant.  Our food was also phenomenal.  Sometimes an expensive steakhouse falls short, which is ironic, but this food was certainly worth every single penny.  We did a deal where for $62.99 each person could do a surf & turf with filet mignon & shrimp or bacon wrapped scallops (we went for the scallops) and also salad, side dish, and dessert.  We of course went for the hot chocolate lava cake.  Drinks were also good.  Highly recommend for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"The bartender here is horrible, she only caters to the men.  I had to ask for a dinner menu yet I was the first in the place. She made sure the two men sitting on my side were taken care of.  Normally, I would give Morton's 5 stars but she ruined this location.    There was a problem with our crab cakes and the manager said he would take them off but she still charged us for them."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and went out to this location

Service was probably a 4 stars but I was unimpressed with the food.

24 ounce Porterhouse, wet aged.... was just... ok.  Sides were better, but just... ok.

If you're in town and need a place to go off strip but close... I guess this is an option."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here to celebrate a birthday.

I originally made a reservation for a party of 8 on Open Table.  The next day or so I was contacted by Diana and asked if we would like to use the a private dining room.  Diana made all the arrangements and customized the menu.

Upon our arrival, we were taken to a very nice private dining room in the back of the restaurant.  It was set up perfectly.  Our server, Trevor, was right there to take our drink order while we waited for a few more to arrive.

Trevor was excellent in explaining the menu and specials to us.  For some of our party, it was their first time at Morton's and they had a few questions.  

We ordered more food than I care to write about.  Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted great.  None of us were disappointed with anything we ordered.

After this dining experience, Morton's will be one of our must do stops for our trips to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I live in Burbank and there is another Morton's there so we had better food here in Burbank. Vegas Morton's food was ok."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but everything was great except for my steak.  I ordered the Ribeye.  It was one of the fattiest cuts I have ever had.  My guest had the filet and it was delicious.  I've had Ribeyes in the past and do not remember them having big chunks of fat the way this one did.  Service was excellent, sides were excellent, dessert was excellent.  Only reason I give 3 stars is because of my cut of meat."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews, but after seeing reviews like the one from \"Virginia S.\" I was like... wow... some of these peeps be cray.  I'd like to apologize to Morton's for them having to serve people like this person.  Here's what she had to say in her 5 star review about an unrelated bar: \"They bring in food trucks in case you get hungry.\"  (no joke.)  
So, hotdogs off the back of a truck, 5 stars.  One of the best steakhouses in the country, 1 star.  And not just 1 star... no.  1 star and a dissertation about the worst experience of her life.  I was surprised when i didn't read the part about how Morton's kicked her dog.   lol.  Oh my dear, sweet Virginia... I hope you'll consider, some day, to stop being so miserable.

Ohh ohh, ummm, sorry I got distracted there.  Morton's?  Excellent food and service, duh."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. I love the appetizers. The bread is wonderful and full of flavor. Every steak I get here has been extremely delicious and melts in my mouth. The sides and entrees are big enough to share with someone. Always a wonderful meal! Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Went last night for my birthday and my experience was very different than other reviewers.  Amazing food, kind staff, and AMAZING and ATTENTIVE service.  Definitely a bit pricey, but was worth it for the special occasion."}
{"text":"We have always had great food and service.  It is just so expensive that I cannot justify going all the way downtown to overpay for a meal that I can get up here in the lake Norman area for half the price at least.  If you want a great meal and service and don't care about spending over a hundred dollars a person this is a wonderful restaurant.  I just can't do it anymore."}
{"text":"Formally, my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Years ago when I would come here the food and service would be exceptional. 

However, lately the food quality has really dropped. It is a little disappointing, I came 2 times in the past 2 months and both times I was left wondering what had happened to the ultra high quality food. 

Full disclosure, one time I came during restaurant week for one of the lackluster meals and the other was a business lunch where the business purchased salads and deserts for everyone. 

I still like the place a lot. But lately it seems like Morton's is more and more empty than I used to remember and maybe that is the reason why."}
{"text":"Honestly, for as much as this place charges, the food should have jumped off my plate and did a jig for me. I didn't think it was anything special at all. The service was good, the ambiance was ok, but the food tasted just ok. 

With all the hype this place has, they sure didn't live up to it."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since we have been here so we decided to try it on a Friday night. It wasn't very crowded and actually had a very nice, quite atmosphere; something difficult to find in a Vegas steak house. We ordered a filet and the NY strip. Everything was cooked to perfection and the service was excellent - just as we remembered. We were just sad that we didn't have room for dessert!"}
{"text":"We randomly wandered into Morton's after catching a Toronto Fashion Week show in Yorkville. I wanted to treat my fiance for joining me at Fashion Week and this was the perfect place to do so!

As soon as we walked in, we were treated like royalty. The host took our jackets and led us to a very nice booth table. Our server was really lovely and super attentive. She took her time explaining every dish to us in detail.

We decided to get a french onion soup to share and our server kindly had the kitchen split our app into two bowls. The soup was really good, loaded with melted cheese and not overly salty (I find French onion to be super laden with sodium most times). Yum!

For my main, I selected the salmon with cream sauce and crab plus shrimps and bae chose the NY strip peppercorn steak. Since entrees don't come with sides, we selected the truffled cauliflower mash to accompany. Bae said his steak was one of the best he has ever had. I really enjoyed my main - the salmon was cooked perfectly and the cream sauce with big pieces of crab was so so good. Bae didn't really enjoy the mash as he found the truffles too overpowering (!) so our server kindly brought us a side of horseradish mashed potatoes instead. We were so stuffed we couldn't even look at the dessert menu.

Would definitely return again for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Someone had given me a gift certificate for $100 that I had been lugging around for a year and this trip was a great opportunity to use it.  We were staying on the strip and were going to glitter gulch to play some craps. We didi not want a long drwn out dinner or to get too filled up. We ate at the Bar and it was exceptionally good service, the bartender John and Rich were excellent, they were just the best bartenders I have met in a long time, they listened to our long winded stories and were just plain nice.  They shook every patrons hand welcoming them it was no wonder there were so many regulars stopping in before they went to the dining room. and we   We shared a NY strip steak and it was perfectly cooked and perfectly delicious.  The Wedge salad is excellent too, something I would never have had and likely won't ever have anywhere else.  Side were great and we really had a good time.  It is off the strip and a little tricky to get to but not really too bad. Our whole dinner was $124.00 and we had 2 bourbons  one steak, two sides and 2 salads.  We did not have wine with dinner.  Go, enjoy they are consistently good.     I thought as i left, I'll be back if only to catch up with the bartenders John and Rich."}
{"text":"Morton's earns its 5 stars every day. They never skip on quality. The attentiveness to you reminds me of old fashioned good service, matched with the old style decor of warm, dark wood. It takes me back to years ago, when dining in Toronto was superb. Morton's have kept up with their excellent reputation all these years."}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour in Vegas.  I go there 2-4 times a week for their amazing happy hour at the bar.  They offer $7 filet mignon trio & crab cake BLT's.  Crazy good deal.  I can't even buy the ingredients for that kind of price.  Selected Beers are $5.50, Wine $7 & $8 for cocktails.  Ask their friendly bartenders for more info on happy hour cocktail deals. 

They also offer Steak & seafood specials at the restaurant for $59.99.  That includes salad, filet mignon, choice of seafood (scallops, shrimp, crab cake or lobster tail), side item & desert.  It's an amazing deal.  Must try their legendary hot chocolate cake!  So good!  

The service is top notch even during the happy hour at the bar."}
{"text":"It's a fairly upscale steakhouse in Cleveland, so be prepared to drop some cash. The steak is cooked skillfully (though, frankly, I've had better). The service is good, and the decor is elegant. Overall, not a bad place to spoil yourself, but if you just want some decent steak, you can get similar quality for cheaper at an Outback."}
{"text":"This review applies to only the Morton's in Scottsdale....

The other and I went in on Sunday May 5th. The GM from the Seattle made our reservation for us.  We are both VIP's from the old Morton's days before they were purchased by Landry's.  As VIP's we clearly enjoy Morton's Steakhouse.  We make it a point that when we travel, if there is a Morton's, we're there.

At Scottsdale, HUGE MISTAKE!

It was quite obvious the staff does not like same sex couples. As they were purposely rude to us.-This statement is too broad, which is unfair.  The server and manager we encountered were rude.  The bartender that evening was great.

 The steaks were just OK.  The dessert souffle was so over cooked you needed a steak knife to cut it.  The server was so inept as she was serving it, she said i don't think you will like it.  But, she served it anyway.  A competent server wouldn't have even left the kitchen with the dessert.

There are many options in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area for Steak.  One in Paradise Valley at the JW Marriott (where we had an exceptional meal two nights prior) and one out in Chandler near where we stayed.

IF YOU ARE A MORTON'S\"S FAN DO NOT EAT HERE.  YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A very good steakhouse experience that comes at the steepest prices I've ever paid.  $250 for two after tip and I could have easily spent $100 more considering we each had one drink and not a bottle of wine.  It's hard for me to even sound like I'm complaining because these was among the best steaks I'ver ever tasted.  I got the Cajun Ribeye ($56), 16 ounce cut, that was truly the tastiest cut of Prime meat I can remember and of course it was cooked to perfection.  My girlfriend got the 12 ounce Filet Mignon ($55) and this was very thick and cooked to perfection as well.  Both steaks were great and seasoned well.  We started with a couple of drinks, which I had the Pineapple fall cocktail which was a a nice mix of cognac and grand marnier ($16).  This was a solid cocktail to enjoy with the meal overall.  For my starter I had the Five Onion Soup ($12) which was small for the price but great tasting nevertheless.  For the side we shared a huge portion of Potatoes Au Gratin ($13), which were good but nothing earth shattering as I would have probably just preferred a loaded baked potato.  To finish the meal off we shared a dish of Creme Brûlée ($13), which I thought was wonderful and definitely worth sticking around for, especially since your bill is already approaching $200.

Food:  9.5/10  Obviously only the best ingredients here.
Service:  10/10  Impeccable service and speed.
Ambiance:  7/10  nothing unique or special; corporate feel the whole way
Value:  6/10  If money is no object... fine.  But not a lot of value for your $
Overall: 7/10  for the money and ambiance, I have other spots.

Unfortunately won't be returning much due to price.  I just like other spots more that feature more creative dishes in a non boiler plate atmosphere.  That being said, you will have a great steak here."}
{"text":"I had been to Morton's in Shanghai, Singapore and Atlanta. But here is the worst. Wagu is too strong to cut. Waitress took my credit card while I had dinner. Onion soup was good and Asparagus was good as well."}
{"text":"We were not disappointed with the food, service or atmosphere! The server was very attentive and answered all questions. I had a small filet which was plenty. We shared a baked potato and it was still too much. I really enjoyed the sautéed broccoli. The salads were just ok. It seemed like everything had anchovies or blue cheese...not a fan. Otherwise this is a great place to celebrate a special occasion because it is pricey."}
{"text":"This is one of our \"go to\" places.  We keep coming back because of the great food and the great (and personable) service.  Happy Hour has so many great food options, even for picky eaters like me!
Filet Mignon (in dining room or at the bar) is always a great choice if you're coming for a full meal.  
Atmosphere is just right too.
Every time we have been here has been a very enjoyable evening...can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This \"IS\" the best damn steak / seafood  place that I have found in a loooong time!!!!  A little on the pricey side but hey, what place isn't here in Vegas??  You want a steak that will melt in your mouth??  Try this place.. If you like a good stiff drink try the Mortini. It's Mortons most famous signature drink.   It will blow you away!!!!  One will do ya just fine, two will probaby put you to sleep or la la land!!!!!!!!!  haha  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine here!
Eat here often, never a bad meal. 
Consistently the best lobster I ever had!"}
{"text":"I ate at Morton's for the first time in a very long time last week. I have to say that somethings don't change, but others have improved dramatically.

For me, Morton's always given me the impression of a Sizzler (or Ponderosa depending on what part of the country you are from) dressed up in fancy clothes. No matter how you tried to hide it, Morton's would always be a chain. Luckily, here in Toronto, the Morton's mother-ship in Chicago has let their Canadian cousin take on a bit of the local colour. I was pleasantly surprised with this Canadian Morton's, that I almost forgot that hundreds of diners in strip malls across the United States were sitting in the exact same chair and table as me.

Despite the drab steakhouse decor, the staff are wonderful and extremely knowledgeable. I ordered the \"slightly smaller\" NY strip and was very satisfied. I was full and it was delicious! I would skip the potato skins. They were very dry and leathery. I would also skip the crab cocktail. The crab meat was quite rubbery. Never the less, the wine was amazing. I recommend that you spend a little time browsing through the wine list and talking to the sommelier. I am sure you you will find a wine to compliment your meal. I drank the Groth Chardonnay and an Australian Shiraz from Grennock that were fantastic.

Overall, if you are looking for a good steakhouse, Morton's should be near the top of your list."}
{"text":"Morton's. Enough said. Not my most favorite location but you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Food is plain and boring, very classic. Nothing fancy about the food at all. The plating lacks creativity and colour. The decor looks run down. Prices are outrageous for the food and decor. Service however is great. This place is in need of a restaurant makeover."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and was very excited to see that they had personalized our groups menus to wish me a Happy Birthday.  Little touches like that go a long way in making someone feel special.

Dinner was delicious. First off, I cannot even describe how much I loved the bread that they give you when you first arrive. I could have just ate that as an appetizer. I started with the shrimp cocktail which was good, but nothing special. For my main course I had the filet and I think we ate at least half of the side dishes that they offer. For dessert, which was complementary since it was my birthday, I had the key lime pie. I think that was the best part of my whole meal. 

So why only 4 stars? The one thing that I expect anywhere I go is to not let my drink go empty. Well both my husband and myself ran out of our drinks and had to flag the waiter down for refills. Our guests also had to ask more than one server for sauce for their child. I think the worst thing that happen was that they did not give all the people in my party an opportunity to order dessert. They had taken my order at the beginning and 2 other people ordered t the chocolate cake that needed to be ordered 30 minutes early, but no one else was offered a dessert menu and instead told that we had desserts already coming.  

Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Call me blasphemous but I didn't order a steak when I came here late one night for their happy hour (10-close). Instead, I sat at the bar and ordered a couple of manhattans and their burger and fries.

First manhattan was good; nothing amazing, but it was great for a well drink.
Second was their current drink special, a barrel-aged concoction with corn whiskey, antica vermouth, and peach bitters. It's 15 dollars but very, very much worth it: the drink is phenomenal, subtle and smooth, and it's served with a raquetball-sized sphere of ice so it stays cool without getting watery.

The burger here might have been my favorite of all time; 20 dollars but worth every penny. Big, beefy, and the juiciest I've ever eaten -- definitely the best I've had in LV and a great splurge for payday.

Will probably be back next time my paycheck looks too fat."}
{"text":"To me, if you're going to drop a hundred bucks per person on dinner it better be worth it and this fell short of my expectations. I had the bone in ribeye and it was average at best. Not what I was expecting for a $60 steak. The Brussel sprouts were hard and bland. And the twice baked potato left a lot to be desired. Our waitress was not very attentive and had to ask for refills a few times. 
I would absolutely make a trip to Ruth Chris but I'm taking Mortons off the wish list. Overpriced for above average food."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went for work and we had the most attentive and friendly wait staff! We were all joking around and having a great time! Completely took over the place with our small but loud group of 4! Split multiple bottles of wine and had many a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So good and definitely better than going to a Capital Grille. If you're looking for a good place to go for a work dinner, I highly recommend. They don't disappoint and have a menu that also caters to those of us who don't like steak- I had their salmon and it was delicious! The apps, especially the tuna tartare, was incredible! 

Hope to be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The bartender was one of the meanest, grumpiest bartenders I've had in years. Older lady - bad red-hair, MEAN AS HELL and obviously pissed off at the world. 

Finishing my drink and going somewhere else for dinner. Avoid this place WHENEVER she's working."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've dined here.  I took my ex boyfriend to Morton's for his 30th birthday, and then we went to Cheerleaders.  This is what happens when you tell your boyfriend you will go WHEREVER HE WANTS for his 30th birthday, and follow it up with, \"SERIOUSLY, WHEREVER YOU WANT.\"  : |

Mortons was by far my favorite, and LEAST EXPENSIVE part of the evening.  Seriously.

So the steak was painfully good.  Like, really good.  We had the filet.  However, what blew my mind was the potatoes.  And the steamed broccoli.  Oh it was soo good.  When we got home that evening, I was like, \"Joe, those potatoes were awesome!\" and he was like, \"What potatoes?\"  : |

The service was excellent.  I keep meaning to come back here, but I never do.  I think next time I come back I'll make sure I'm not the one paying though, it's $$$ but who goes out for discount steaks?"}
{"text":"Sadly this review will be short. The night before we had steak, lobster, crab cakes, oysters etc at the Auqanox, so some of us only had appetizers. My lobster mac and cheese and lump crab cake was awesome!!  Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the other food they ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered oysters some very small. Not consistent in size. Lobster bisque little flavor and watery. 

Ordered filet Oscar style and the crab was dry. 

Brussel sprouts poor taste due to bacon fat making it taste funny.

Alcohol was good. 

Molten cake food. 

Will not go again. Fleming's is superior."}
{"text":"This is the best Mortons of the six we have visited. If I'm going to drop $200+ for dinner for two (no wine or drinks) then this is where I want to do it. The bone in  Filet Mignon was so tough I had to put pressure on my fork to cut it. The prime rib for two - amazing. The jumbo Lump Crab cake - devine, the carrot cake - fantastic.
Ask for Mark Amirr."}
{"text":"In a sentence: Morton's delivers a first-rate classic steakhouse experience but at top-level prices.  This is definitely not a value play.  You'll find yourself full, happy, and scrambling to figure out how all those numbers on the check add up to the alarmingly large number at the bottom.

The dining room was unnervingly empty for 6:30pm on a Thursday evening.  And by \"unnervingly,\" I actually mean \"totally.\"  It took a couple of minutes standing by the entrance for the maître d' to come over and seat us.  After that slight hiccup, the service was top shelf, and even two or three tables joined in as the night wore on (though restaurant still remained quite empty).  My first drink, a simple martini with anchovy-stuffed olives was very good, but expensive--I believe somewhere in the $14 to $16 range.  For appetizers, we settled on the Colossal Shrimp Cocktail, a dish of four gigantic shrimp (easily three bites per shrimp) for $20.50.  I also had a bowl of the Lobster Bisque ($14, I think), which was pretty good, but not something significantly better than what one could get in other top area restaurants.  I will add that the onion loaf bread ($0, alright!) was very good.

After showing us the cuts of meat available--viewable on a platter covered in plastic wrap--I settled on the bone-in filet mignon--a cut I haven't seen before together with a price tag ($58) not often seen either.  For sides, we went with the Steamed Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce and simple Hashbrown Potatoes topped with butter, bacon, and sour cream.  The hollandaise sauce was good, but I thought the asparagus might have benefited from slightly more cooking.  I thought the potatoes were a pretty good side--nothing complicated but enjoyable nonetheless.

The bone-in filet was expertly cooked to the chef's recommendation of medium-rare, still tender in the middle surrounded by a nice crust.  Still, I was expecting a lot more based on the waiter's representation (as I've also heard at other steakhouses) that having the bone still on the filet enhanced the taste.  I would probably just opt for a regular filet without the bone-in premium next time.

For dessert, I had a Double Chocolate Mousse--a solid dessert that surprisingly did not come off as too heavy after a steak dinner, but, at the same time, not particularly amazing in any way.  Be forewarned that the slice of Carrot Cake is absolutely massive.

Overall, the service was friendly and generally of very high quality, not super high-end but appropriate for a classic steakhouse.  The steak was also very good.  I think you would have a hard time finding a better steak in Cleveland, but at the same time I was expecting something more out of it at those price points.  I'll say it again, you pay a premium for the experience here.  Finally (and admittedly knowing that Morton's is, in the end, a national chain), I couldn't help but feel that something about the culinary experience--possibly in the selections of food available--felt canned.  I think this separates some of my favorite steak places (Peter Lugar's in Brooklyn, NY and Prime in Las Vegas, NV) from Morton's.  Having said all of that, Morton's is still a high quality restaurant deserving of its four stars."}
{"text":"What I would consider an average steakhouse.  The food was good, but nothing special, the service was okay.  There are far better steakhouse venues in this city (Flemings, Eddie V's, Maestro's, Ruth Chris' for example).  And when you add in the cost, not very likely we'll be going back there."}
{"text":"This was the first time in years that we had eaten at Morton's and it will likely be a long time before we return.  We decided to return during AZ Restaurant Week, during which we chose a different restaurant almost nightly.  It's a great opportunity for restaurants to demonstrate their kitchen and hopefully win over new guests.  Morton's, at least our server, did not see it that way and at first seemed to treat Restaurant Week attendees as burdens rather than guests.  He warmed up over time, but first impressions remain.
The food, although fine, was not remarkable as it's reputation and prices would imply.  Nothing was of concern, but nothing about the evening was special and Morton's historically has been a place for special occasions.  There are lots of restaurants in this price bracket that still serve as the forums for special occasions, Morton's food seems to have moved into the everyday, but there prices have remained."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp!

So it's Sunday, I got my reserved booth table as requested.  Service is first class starting from the valet parking to my dimly lit table.  We start off with 2 Morton's Spa-tini.  Had two sips, didn't like it.  I forgot the name of them but they were $19ea.  Next, ordered some basic mix drinks, much better.

We requested for 2 colossal king crab legs steamed for appetizers.  They do not have this on the menu but they can make it when requested.  The crab was really good, not overly steamed but perfect and tons of meat.  I ordered the colossal shrimp cocktail.  These shrimps mustve been injected with steriods! They were huge!  We also shared a caesar's salad.  The salad was weak, way too much cheese, I'm more of a fan of the caesar salad from Duncan's House/Octagon/The School.  Anyways moving on, I had to pause because I was pretty sure I was 75% full.

Main course - Date had the 20oz strip sirloin. She finished 15% of the steak.  It was done medium well and looked great.  Tasted even better, lots of juice and flavour.
I had the 24 or 26 oz t bone rib eye, I did better maybe 30% of the steak.  Very well marbled and tasted AWESOME! Side order was sauteed mushrooms (huge portion! maybe 3-4x more than the Keg) and also asparagus - same huge portions too!  Anyhow, that all went to a doggy bag.  

Dessert - had the special for that nite, some warmed up lava chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and the entire box of whipped cream topped with a cherry. We ate, 10%? of it.  The dessert didn't seem like it had moved after we consumed it! lol

Anyhow, so the food was awesome, service was great, only if they would tell us that maybe we didn't have to order so much for two people. Overall, this place is decent not spectacular.  I expected more for a $400 dinner.  Harbour 60 was better imo, environment was ok I preferred Tom Jones Steakhouse environment, caesar salad sucked- I prefer the Octagon/Duncan House caesar's more."}
{"text":"Loved the food. This is a great place for steak and a good glass of wine. I suggest u stop by if in cleveland. I had the cowboy with crab cakes. Yes it was good. O and steve makes a good mojito 

Visited Sept 2011"}
{"text":"I've been to Morton's on three seperate occasions and have never been disappointed. The food and staff are all top notch. The atmosphere is accommodating to almost any style. Excellent for the need to impress anniversary, birthday, or other special event."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my birthday. After reading some of the reviews we were a little worried but to be honest we had a great time and had some amazing service. 

My husband had a \"sidecar\" to drink and he said it was very good and strong. I had ice tea that was good as well. We enjoyed a lobster bisque. My husband had the mixed grills with the fillet and I enjoy the ribeye.
The food was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. 

For my birthday they put my name on the menu, took or photo and gave us a free soufflé. 

Both my husband and I really enjoyed our date night 

Thank you for making my birthday very special."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to go on special occasions or birthdays!  I made a reservation and the waitress asked if it was for a special occasion so they can customize their menu.  I thought that was very nice of them to do.  

Came in, the place was very dim, but that's how most intimate places are anyways.  There were many places to sit, so there was no wait, and we were seating right away.

We started with a glass of Merlot, escargots, and dinner came with onion bread and butter on the table.  The onion bread with onion flakes were not my favorite, but still good.  Escargots were swimming in butter sauce.  Small piece of puff pastry sits on top of each escargot.  

We ordered the 16oz cajun (blackened) ribeye and decided to split it since we figured 8oz would be enough.   Pairing ribeye with the Merlot was a great idea!  The Merlot tastes sweeter after tasting the ribeye.  I thought the steak was a bit on the salty side, but still good.  I ordered medium rare, and juicy medium rare was what I got!  

For dessert we ordered some port.  Our server came out with some complimentary bread pudding, ice cream, and a candle for the birthday celebrant.  The bread pudding was amazing.  

The hostess asked if we wanted a photo, so she took a photo of us, printed the photo, but it in a paper frame with (Happy Birthday), and handed it to us.  At most places this costs money, but not here!

When I got the bill, I noticed that they took 25% \"special occasion\" discount. WOW!  How many places do that?

All the reasons why you should celebrate your special occasion with your significant other here!"}
{"text":"With family in town we decided to stop by Morton's for dinner on Saturday. It was a true experience. Our server Tara was phenomenal!! She was detailed, attentive, informed, and very sweet. The food was delicious with a perfect wine list for pairings. The establishment, ambiance, and service all added to our enjoyment of the night."}
{"text":"Service was great. Our server memorized our selection and there were 4 of us. Do me a favour though- do not order a steak and ask for it to be well done! That was my only mistake. Atmosphere is upscale so dress accordingly."}
{"text":"The quality of the food does not match the price! The lobster was chewy as well as the steak! I would recommend arrowhead grill over Morton's any day!"}
{"text":"My wife and I joined friends for happy hour here the other evening and I was very impressed with the price of drinks and selection of bar food. The steak tacos were delicious and the ambience was excellent. This is a place where you can come and interact with others and a nice break from noisy bars."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The two stars is for the server Luke. Cajun ribeye was dry and somewhat chewy. Escargot didn't have enough garlic butter,  bacon wrapped scallops, bacon wasn't crispy,  oyster Rockefeller was very very bland. My first time and last. Unfortunate because restaurant was beautiful and so was the service. 

The manager called me and apologized for not being happy with my dinner. That was very nice and good to know he cares about his customers. 
I WILL go back again and give it a try. We all have a bad day but with all the great reviews I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Food: I came here for a sponsored dinner. It came with a salad, your choice of entree, and your choice of dessert. 

- Salad: Mixed greens, 3 slices of crunchy green apple, and blue cheese: I really enjoyed this salad. The flavors complemented well together. 5/5

- Chicken: 2 pieces of garlic breaded chicken with a side of green beans and mashed potatoes. The breading was tasty and the chicken was moist. The mashed potatoes was moist and the green beans had good flavor. 4/5

- Dark chocolate mousse: semi-sweet and light. Good way to end the dinner :) 4/5

Service: Fast, friendly, and professional. 4/5

Final thoughts: I would definitely come back here. Food was great, service was great."}
{"text":"Hmmm it was a quiet calm Sunday night on my last day in town and my girl & I decided to go out for my birthday month! 

And I seen other steakhouses here in Cleveland but Morton is a favorite of mines in Chicago. 

We were greeted and seated very quickly. Our waiter was absolutely amazing ! She properly came back and fourth while my girl and I were indecisive about which drinks we wanted, appetizers, and even main course. Lol 

Our waiter took pictures of us with both my phone and the restaurant camera! And even printed them up for both me and my friend! 

It didn't even there! I was brought out there famous Sunday with chocolate cake bites inside ! 

Best celebration this month so far !"}
{"text":"Amazing Valentine's dinner, Feb. 14, 2012. Yes, it's expensive - expect to spend more than $200 for a dinner for two including an appetizer, bread (complimentary), a glass of champagne, a steak, salad, and potato. 

Our food was excellent, the service was exemplary, and the entire experience made us feel like royalty. We couldn't have had better service. We also couldn't believe the sheer size of the steaks - my \"slightly smaller\" NY strip steak was about 2 1/2 times the size of the smallest steak at Outback. My husband's regular-size steak looked like at least 12 oz., maybe more, and both of us took about half of our steaks home. My husband's garlic mashed potatoes were enough to feed three people, so we took the extras home too. The huge loaf of warm bread was crunchy on the outside, tender and tasty inside, and when crumbs got all over the table, our server quickly came and removed them with his little scraper (very elegant). 

A photographer took our photo and presented it to us in a signed folder a few minutes later. The ambiance was upscale, elegant, but very comfortable too. There was a coat check, valet parking ($6 plus tip), and just all-around excellent customer care. 

The menu is a la carte - each item is ordered separately, and there are plenty of choices, but again, you need to be prepared to ignore those high prices (like $47 - 54 just for the steak alone). I had to send my steak back because I ordered it \"medium well\" and it came rare-medium, and the manager himself brought it back to me with apologies. 

We couldn't have chosen a better place for a very special night out. If you're looking for a romantic place for next Valentine's Day, or to propose to your sweetie, or whatever, and you're not afraid to spend some extra bucks for the experience, I highly recommend this Morton's Steakhouse."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing Happy Hour (they call it 'power hour').  I always look to yelpers to help me know what to order.  So here you go.

The bartenders always say that the filet sandwiches are the most popular but the hamburgers are the best.  I've had both. Both are good - but you know how awesome a good burger is don't you?  Get those.

Also must get the iceberg wedge bites.  How smart to make them small - and easy to divide up between the husband and I.  So happy.

The chicken - skip it.  Or just drive through McDonalds and get some on the way home if you want chicken nuggets.

The crab is good.  We only got it once cause my sister-in-law was visiting and insisted on getting them (we're stuck in our burger and iceberg wedge bite rut).  So ok, they are the best crab cakes I've had in years - really almost all crab and not all breading like other places.  But they serve them on little buns with bacon and lettuce - which is ok and if you're inventive you could pull the crab cakes off the buns eat them as crab cakes, then eat a little blt sandwich.

The drink menu is limited, but it's one reason we go there.  Why don't more places have a Manhattan on the happy hour menu? grrrr - leaves us going here or Donovan's all the time (which btw has the bigger and better Manhattan on the happy hour menu - they use Woodford Reserve - mmm - but the food is limited, and I find Mortons bar more cozy).  They do have a couple girly drinks - a Cosmo and some Palm Beach thingy.

Oh, and if you like a crowded rowdy popular happy hour, either go elsewhere, or come here late on game nights - visiting teams will often stop by after the game is over."}
{"text":"Morton's Steak House was pretty impressive. We went for a friends birthday and I ordered the 6oz filet, with shrimp & scallops and it was all really good. It very pricey, table of 9 and the bill was $675 but the food was fresh, delicious and I was stuffed when I left."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food isn't bad at all.  But, when you are asked to pay the amount that Morton's charging, then your standard is elevated.  For the price that I paid, I expect to be wowed, and sadly that wasn't the experience.  First, the staff and service was very adequate, not too intrusive, just the right balance, and they were friendly, we were asked by different staff members if everything was fine, which it was, but it wasn't great.  The meal consisted of a Morton Salad, Mashed Potatoes and an 8 oz Fillet Mignon.  The salad was large enough for 2 people, but  unfortunately, it was poor.  It was basically, Romaine Lettuce, chopped eggs and blue cheese dressing.  That's\"s it!  Not  tomatoes, no cucumbers, no onions,  not even lowly croutons.  Tasty, but very average.  The mashed potatoes were good, tasty,  had a slight taste of sour cream and chives. Not bad.  The steak, the entire reason I'm here.  It was not bad.  I ordered medium rare, the marinade seemed a little a sweet for my taste, and I want to say, might have a hint of teriyaki, but I'm not a 100 percent certain.  Not my favorite combination, but it wasn't horrible either.  When I pay 40 plus dollars for a piece of steak, I expect it to be so tender, that the knife goes through it without much resistance.  The first couple bites were almost perfect, but the more I got to the center of  it, the chewier and tougher the steak got.  This steak should be tender throughout.  That was the most disappointing.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but based on other similar steakhouses that I've eaten at, this should have been better."}
{"text":"Their steaks are incredible - what can I say? Service is superb. The only thing stopping me short of a five star rating is the price of course - but you get what you pay for. Their sides are good but not outstanding and their desserts are also very good - again nothing that I would write home over however."}
{"text":"Just as you would expect... steaks grilled to perfection... impeccable wait staff... totally worth the visit...highly recommend...."}
{"text":"Good food. Service getting drinks was a little slow. Very dark inside. Needed a flash light to see the menu"}
{"text":"I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed with my overall experience. 

My boyfriend and I attended Morton's this evening to take advantage of restaurant week. I'm not sure if restaurant week had something to do with the sub par food. If so, its a shame because you would think the restaurant would want to feature their bests. 

We both ordered the Morton salad with egg, anchovies, and blue cheese and we both agreed that the salads had too much dressing. 

For the main course, he ordered the 16 once bone in pork chop and I ordered the 6 ounce   
filet. He definitely went with the better option. The pork was flavorful and delicious. The filet was undercooked, I ordered it medium and it was medium rare. Good flavor, but honestly not better than any filet I've prepared at home. 

The sides left much to be desired. I ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes. We had to send the potatoes back because they were cold. The broccoli and the potatoes were very bland not much flavor at all, and there was certainly a lack of presentation. 

For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse and he had the key lime pie. The pie was probably the best thing about the whole experience, that and the onion bread. 

In hindsight, I'm glad we didn't pay full price and I'd much rather have eaten at Ruth Chris or any of the other restaurants participating in restaurant week. For the price, it wasn't bad given the amount of food, but I expected more from Morton's. Don't believe I will be returning here unless it's free!"}
{"text":"I like Morton's. I have been to quite a few Morton's in my lifetime, but last night, this particular location left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 

See I was there a wine event, and in my defense, I knew I should have made sure that I had enough cash on me prior to arriving, but I didn't think anything of it. After finally finding a parking spot and walking in then did I realize, crap I don't have enough cash. The young lady that was taking money for the even was nice and she stated that I could fill out a credit authorization form, which is me basically writing down my credit card information on a piece of paper for them to charge later. Yea no. I wasn't comfortable with that idea so she said to try to the bar as they should be able to help you.

So I go over to the bar and it was busy, but not overly busy. I made eye contact with both bartenders, smiled and waited. 5 mins later, I am still waiting and never received a \" I will be right with you, or Hi their, what can I get you\" however other patrons that came up to the bar after me were helped immediately. Yea FAIL!

Even then I was like ok, I let it go. Yes I was disappointed but I let it go. So go to try to find a manager to see if I could find a way to pay for the wine event that was going on. I explained the situation to the hostess at the door and she called over a manager or the head hostess guy, I am not sure. She explained to him what my request was he told that hostess \"I can't assist her right now\" (meaning me). She then said \"but can't we just scan her card for the $15, it will only take a minute?\", and the he again proceed to say, \"I don't have time to do that so no I cannot assist her\". Mind you I am standing right next to both of them as this conversation is happening. If you could have seen the look on my face. The hostess immediately apologies and I tell her it is fine, no worries and I turn to walk out the door when the manager or head hostess says to me, \" Can I do anything else for you?\" What the??!!! Are you kidding me?  Hmm no,  but thanks. You have been most helpful.

So needless to say that I did not attend the wine event and I left Morton's very disappointed. From the service I received at the bar down to the head hostess or manager.  Yes I know I should have made sure I had cash on me for this event but seriously?

Funny thing is that I went to another place to calm down and to have a drink. Although I was upset, I still smiled and made eye contact with the bartender and she immediately came over to me and said, \"Hi!  Give me a second and I will be right with you\". Get this, this bar was BUSIER than Morton's."}

He had such a great time, dinner for all of us was excellent, steaks cooked to perfection. My husbands chicken dish was fresh and succulent. We will definitely be back again. Service was excellent and the manager was wonderful."}

{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. 

I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.

Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large \"Onion Loaf\" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the \"Chopped Salad\" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. 

You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the \"Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes\" and \"Lyonnaise Potatoes\" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.

So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the \"Key Lime Pie\" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing \"lime\" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. 

I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to visit mortons anywhere in tbe country.very nice dark comfy setting.waiters and manager was very nice and welcoming.cajun ribeye was great as usual and so was the cosmo,s."}
{"text":"Morton's is one of my all time favorite steakhouses. We have been to this location on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed. 

To start, we've had the raw bar appetizer which is always fresh and delicious. I always order the filet mignon medium rare, while my husband will change up what he gets. The sides are huge and made for sharing. The creamed spinach is yummy, the baked potato is huge, the hashed brown potatoes are nice and crispy but I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. 

The key lime pie is delicious and the legendary hot chocolate cake melts in your mouth but the soufflé for two is always a winner. 

Also, don't worry about parking because they have valet up front."}
{"text":"Morton's gets a 4 star because they are more expensive than Peter Luger's and not as good as Peter Lugers.

However, Morton's is a very good chain steakhouse. I'd suggest going with a group of people so then you can order the porterhouse for 2. It is delicious. They bring it out on a hot place and set it between the 2 people eating it. You are then each given a piping hot plate with hot butter drizzled on it. The server then puts some of the meat on your plate and rubs it around in the butter. Delicious. For the sides, I would suggest getting the creamed spinach. The asparagus isn't bad either. 

I actually went there for my fraternity senior class dinner with a group of 8 guys and they gave us our own room which was really cool. You just have to put down a cover for each person which you lose if one guy doesn't show up. We all got the porterhouse for 2. 

For deserts, you need to get the souffle which has to be ordered with the meal because it takes some time to make.

After multiple bottles of $60-80 wines, the total tab came out to a little more than $1000 for the table which wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"We have been here several times.  Normally we go in for their happy hour food and beverages.  I liked the truffled matchstick fries, filet mignonette trio and the crab cake blts.  The crab, spinach and artichoke dip is excellent also."}
{"text":"Holy cow my review for this place is laaaaatttteeee. I went during restaurant week this past time (yeah I know it's been a month at least) but hey it was that fantastic that I remember every juicy detailed bite to tell you all about it! So my guy and I were really looking for some redemption after our not so fantastic experience at capital grille so my guy suggested here to give it a shot. 

So in my opinion the most amazing steaks I've had have been at places that realize that when something is already good don't try to over think it don't add 17 different seasonings and toppings until you can't tell your eating a steak anymore! I want my steak to taste like steak! And lemme tell ya Mortons got it right! My filet melted in my mouth it was savory with just the right amount of light seasoning like salt and pepper and cooked to perfection! The sides of mashed potatoes were creamy and light with just what tasted like a little butter and salt/pepper.  I don't know maybe they have some magic working back there because it was delicious without a ton of stuff added to them. Perfect. 

They also provide you with the biggest loaf of bread I've ever been served at any restaurant ever with onion wine jam to spread on it. It was addictive! I mean did they not have want me to have room left? Seemed like it I couldn't stop eating it and there seemed to be an endless supply!

The staff were also great attentive even given the crazy restaurant week crowd we never wanted for a thing and we sat at the bar. They also have complimentary valet outside but there's always parking on the street too! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"While attending the CEO/CFO Group luncheon today, I experienced Morton's best with  service by Jen, Ron, & Pam!
These individuals made the experience absolutely wonderful.
My compliments to the General Manager, Daniel Hurst!"}
{"text":"This place is fine.  You will get a flavorful steak here.  Cooked to your liking.  The sides are great also.  The thick cut fries are not my favorite. Never been a fan of thick cut.  Just eat a baked potato.  It defeats the purpose.
The service was so so.  For what we are paying you would expect the service to be spectacular.  
Overall average but there are much better options out there value and taste wise.
Not as show and tell as Jacobs and Micheals, but still has that show and tell value that people seem to go back for."}
{"text":"While everyone generally knows what Morton's Steakhouse is about, we tend to look for the unique aspects of the different locations we visit. Pittsburgh is one of the most unique Morton's you'll visit with a rich history of once being the only true steakhouse in the Steel City before the Capital Grill and other establishments came to town around 2000. As soon as you walk in you not only see but feel the Steelers, Pirates, Penguins and local celebrities that have been here before you. It's a great feeling that reaffirms you are in a special place.

Also notable is the level of service at this Morton's. It's world class. I haven't seen this level of service at any other Morton's I've been to. Staff treat you like a King and take care of every aspect of your experience. It's exceptional.

As for the food - it doesn't get better. Their meats are made to perfection and the quality of everything is above average. The New York Strip is always good, as is the rib eye. Ask for their special cuts of the night too. And do your best to leave room for dessert - the chocolate Molton lava cake is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week. The restaurant is not that nice inside the wait staff was not very professional. I ordered the chop salad. It appeared to be on leaf on lettuce chopped up no avocado(as stated on menu) blah. My steak was ordered medium came to table WELL done so it was sent back. The bread was not made fresh there tasted like a roll from Fry's. Dessert was okay. Much better places out there for much cheaper. I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"It was great that Morton's did Restaurant Week, which gave us reason to give the fancy steakhouse chain a try. The ambiance and service are what you'd expect from a place like this--very professional and polite from entering to exiting with valet and coat check options, somewhat dimly lit interior with perfectly set up tables and comfy chairs, and a nice view of the grilling area at the back (but very subtle, you can ignore that if you want to). The service could've been faster overall but I suppose this is how it's normally like.

In terms of food, I'd say everything was pretty great save for the appetizers. The wedge salad was just okay and the ahi tuna was tasty, but the latter was falling over as the waitress placed it on our table (so no presentation points there) and it came with a weird choice of fried wontons that didn't really seem to go well with it all. The complimentary bread was probably better than both apps--it was nice and warm and fluffy on the inside. The filet mignon was what it was of course, a juicy, tender piece of steak cooked as we ordered it. Perhaps it could've been a bit less salty but it was otherwise what we expected. Finally, we enjoyed both dessert courses, a creamy chocolate mousse (there was a lot in that apparently small glass) and a savory creme brulee. 

Overall it was a good experience. Probably not in our budget normally, but a steal at Restaurant Week prices."}
{"text":"It's Mortons .   You can't give less than a 5 star rating .    Pam was our server and she was excellent.  Split a steak and saved room for desert.  The mac and chesse was excellent.  We walked in 20 minutes befor closing and would never even know.

A must if you want a great steak and visit vegas."}
{"text":"Beyond repairable. Do not visit this establishment ever. You will get better service at Outback but a better experience at Ruth Chris, Mastro's, Donavans, Flemings just to name a few. Seafood tower, is a bowl of picked over crab and shrimp, can't afford truffle, but uses cheap truffle oil... But the problems here are with the service and overall management.  The waiter spilt a full.. I repeat a full bottle of wine all over the table and floor, mannager says its his first day but no apology, but when we realize the wine was all over my wife's shoes and bag, when we brought it to the restaurants attention the next day, they avoided a return call. I then emailed on their contact us page after 1 week after no response, still no response. I just received a call from a young lady in corporate, who has told be that this event didn't occur... Wow 495.00 for 3 bowls of soup, horrible lobster mac and cheese, 1 salad, 1 filet, and a entire bottle of wine spilt on the floor and table??.. You stay classy Mortons, you have just been surpassed. Scottsdale has so much more to offer, Cheesecake next door is better, but for a steak, in the same 2 minute radius is Ocean club and Dominick's is better service, food, atmosphere and overall experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary.  We had some gift cards so even though we knew it was expensive we wanted to try it.  Wow, I wasn't prepared for how expensive!  Guess I know why they don't list prices online!

We both got the prime ribeye steaks and agreed that they were probably the best steaks we'd ever had.  I can't complain about anything, service was excellent, food too.  I was a little shocked though when I saw the bill and 1 bottle of San Pellegrino cost almost as much as a case in the store.  Talk about markup!  Our drinks, 3 cocktails were $50!  And I gotta say, the Mojito's my husband makes at home, from scratch, are way better than the $15 or $16 one I got there.  And the whisky he drank, we could have bought a bottle.  I realize you're going to pay more in a restaurant by yikes!

Like I said, the food really was excellent.  I would have given a 5 star rating but the water and alcohol prices and quality brought it down.  I wish I'd known the menu prices beforehand.  We still probably would have gone, I just would have bought more gift cards."}
{"text":"We made reservations the night before Valentine's Day. We were initially seated at a very small table for two. Our waiter Bob was accommodating and moved us to a larger table. 

We ordered appetizers ~ oysters on the half shell and escargot. The oysters were fresh and succulent served with lemon, Tabasco and raw horseradish. The downside was the weak, lackluster horseradish. No zing at all. The escargot was garnished with tiny bits of puff pastry. They were okay and would be better presented without the puff pastry. 

I ordered the 6 oz petit filet mignon with scallops and shrimp. My companion ordered the 12 oz petit filet and a lobster tail. My steak was a perfect medium rare but not too warm, his was medium. We asked Bob, our waiter, for horseradish and let him know the one served with the oysters was pallid. He delivered! 

Overall, the service was excellent and the food good. I will eat here again. The price for the two of us was $298 so it is pricey for Cleveland. 

Be sure to make reservations and you'll be seated promptly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went here last month with a bunch of people and ordere the special of the month. Let me tell you, we had so much food in our tummy by the end of the night, i think we all wanted to fight each other for the bathroom.  
Service: above average - waitress was cool and the manager even checked on us
Food: Excellent - Order the spinach, chocolate cake, steak (of course!), tiger shrimp, obligatory mashed potatoe, bottle(s) of wine. Not in that order of course. DO NOT order: Scallops (overcooked) and lime cake (too bland)
Negative: that freaking valet boy! A--hole!"}
{"text":"We went to Morton's for a regular weekly dinner night, heading in they offer valet but we had to wait a bit for them to open. Talking with no smartphones.. it was horrible. The interior is dark, cool, polished and has a sleek modern appearance. I prefer this kind of environment that's very dark, so if this isn't your thing you may not enjoy the atmosphere. Perfect for a romantic date night. I ordered a mojito and it tasted like a very watery mojito with barely there liquor and a few mint leaves floating around in the glass. Sent it back and ordered a sangria instead which was much better. I am fortunate enough to have access to some of the best wines, so I never really order their wines here. They offer cabinets to store your own wine. The jumbo shrimp cocktail sauce was bland to my shrimp cocktail. Lucky Wishbone where are you?!?! I longed for just a bit of horseradish..
The BLT crab cakes were fried crisply but lacked color, and appeared a little unappetizing but tasted like meaty crab. The filet mignon sandwiches and prime cheeseburgers arrived hot but the filet mignon was a little overcooked and on the tougher side than normal. I think they were having an off night I guess because the restaurant was absolutely dead inside until it started to pick up at the end. The service was very nice and was at least redeeming in that quality. The sangria surprisingly was boozy enough to make me forget all my cares temporarily and scarf down truffle fries."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here last night celebrating my birthday. The service was excellent and the waiter was by far one of the best I ever had . The manager even offered a free dessert for the occasion.  I have been to mortons before on the east coast but this place is top notch . For Appetizer we went with the shrimp cocktail. The presentation was so cool and the shrimps were great served with their own special cocktail sauce . We shared our entrees . Cajun ribeye was full of flavor and spice but was not hot at all , definitely one of the best steaks I ever had . We also had the mix grill that they offer with 3 different combinations. We chose the bacon wrapped scallops , crab cake & grilled shrimp. A great dish and we had sour cream mashed potatoes on the side . For dessert we finished our night off with the molten chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking to go out for a top notch steak house while in vegas. I know my next trip to vegas will include a night at mortons."}
{"text":"Loved it at Morton's! :) Food was terrific and service was excellent - our waitress came back to check us in good intervals and knew the menu inside out. The champagne she recommended was lovely.

I'd recommend the Center-Cut Filet Mignon and their Signature Cut Prime New York Strip. Cooked medium rare, it was delicious!! We also ordered mashed potatoes on the side - buttery and creamy, very nice.

The Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake is highly recommended. It was soooo good. For chocolate lovers out there, you'll definitely enjoy this! We enjoyed this very much despite being really full from all the food. There's always room for desserts :D"}
{"text":"Wow this place was good~ The steak is obviously top grade and their side dish was excellent as well. My friend said that the French Onion was a bit salty but I believe a French Onion is supposed to be salty. Also try the asparagus its very good. The server explained things a bit quickly but he told us not to memorize anything because it will all be in the menu so that wasn't a problem. Check this place out if you win some money in the Casino."}
{"text":"My friend was celebrating her birthday here and I was the only vegan in the group, which is totally fine, I figured I'd have martinis for dinner  But instead, the chef surprised me with the most DELICIOUS veggie platter! I would actually come back just to have veggies here again! Our server, Mike, was super accommodating; the service was exceptional! I should mention we also had a baby with us, and even though it's not an ideal place to bring children, they were very welcoming and even gave us a table with plenty of space for the stroller."}
{"text":"OK, so the story is we had dinner here previously and left a almost brand new big  bottle of Hennessy cognac. We had anticipated that everyone was gonna drink but it turns out that nobody drinks lol. So we ended up drinking only 2 glasses out of whole bottle. They told us that we can enjoy our unfinished cognac when we come back to dine again and ensured us by taping our business card on our bottle and sealed it with tape.  We came back to dine and found out they dont have our bottle anymore. And the bus boy to our server Carey was so rude we ended up calling the manager and general manager but they were all rude and unprofessional(they lied so much it was ridiculous)  however after a long and unpleasant arguments they ended up giving us a new bottle of cognac. We left the bottle half empty. It was so unpleasant we wanted to eat and pay them almost $500 for our dinner and get the hell out of there.  Yes!!! we are definitely taking our business to somewhere else.  There are plenty of expensive steak houses in town that have better customer service."}
{"text":"Just came back for my birthday dinner and it was perfect! 
The food was amazing, the cocktails were great and service was attentive but not rushed. 
I had a wonderfully romantic and memorable experience."}
{"text":"I enjoy a good steak as much as anyone, and can honestly say that the meal I had here is one of the best I ever had. My ribeye was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the baked potato I had as a side was piping hot. My wife and I split a piece of hot chocolate cake for dessert, and that was great, too. Yes, it's expensive (we wouldn't have gone here if not for an awesome wedding present), but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I dined here on Saturday evening with my family. I must say that I had the most nasty rib eye steak, scallops, shrimp, crab cake, and potatoes that I have ever had in my life. I will never ever step foot in this establishment ever again in life. The servers were great! I would give Mortons 0 stars if it were possible. I will stick to Lawry's."}
{"text":"My husband and I were Morton's VIPs for many years and ate at the San Diego location around 100 times.

We've given up on Morton's because they just don't seem to get it right and don't seem to know or care. Paying close to $200 for dinner, we believe, should entitle us to that once sublime experience. Then a caesar salad, cajun ribeye, and molten lava cake were all dreamy.

Now when we ask why everything except the cake tastes different, we're told we're simply mistaken."}
{"text":"My wife and I took a friend to Morton's after a Steeler's game 7 October.  I have never been to one of these steakhouses so it was a real treat to experience it in Pittsburgh.  It was absolutely the best steak and meal I've had at any steakhouse or honestly a dinner anywhere.  Everything was perfect...steaks, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, and the veggies were just amazing.  I literally fell in love with the cream corn.  The manager (Robert) came over and personally checked on us, engaged in a conversation for at least 10 minutes and was just ensuring our experience was perfect.  It was.  The after dinner drinks and desert (a chocolate lava type cake) was beyond words.  This is now my favorite place and steakhouse.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I'm looking at other reviews, so I must have had amazing experiences the other times I've been here, and most recently, for my birthday dinner. I love it  when you give Morton's a heads up that you're there for a special occasion, they will provide a customized menu with the mention of it :). Heck, they even ask if you want a picture of the night and present it to you in a lovely personalized card. How sweet. It's the little touches that I love! 

Utilized that complimentary valet and walked right in to our booth with hot bread already awaiting us! Brandon was our waiter for the night and that guy was absolutely awesome on service from beginning to the very end. Professional and personable, he made the experience of dining here is worth it over the other steeakhouses throughout Vegas.

You can't go wrong with the Cajun Ribeye steak. It's a lotta meath!!! (that's what she said!)

I tried the 6 oz. filet mignon with 3 grilled shrimp and 2 bacon wrapped scallops. OMG...this was so damn good! You get variety of meat, but boy on boy, they cook the scallops here so perfect, they melt in your mouth! Delish!!!!

This location didn't quite get the sauteed brussels sprouts down--that needs improvement.

Bacon and onion mac and cheese here is decadent. DECADENT.

Get a split of a chopped spinach salad to pretend that you got something remotely \"healthy\" at a steakhouse ;). It's good nonetheless from that reason.

With all that food, definitely save room for their desserts. I opted for their chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream to round out our gluttony. I won't lie, I think I popped one of my pant's buttons.

All in all, this Morton's location has never failed me!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steak. Gentlemen's club decor. Professional service. Valet parking. Expensive."}
{"text":"Came here for my dad's birthday dinner and enjoyed the old-school classy vibe.

Joe Mimran (of Joe Fresh) sat a couple tables over.

Don't know which steak to order? I strongly recommend the Chicago-style bone-in rib eye. It's the most marbled cut, thus the most flavourful, cooked Chicago style--i.e. black on the outside, pink on the inside (\"that's how I like my women\" commented my husband....uggh.. ;) ) Seriously, that is one CHOICE steak, cooked to perfection. (PS I like it medium-rare \"plus\"....that is, just a smidge more than medium rare.)

Also done to perfection was the macaroni and cheese. It's a MUST if you're looking for a rich side dish. The matchstick fries were far less impressive.

Chopped salad, lobster cocktail, oysters, shrimp alexander.....all were delicious.

The bill for 6 people was about $550 (although we didn't purchase alcohol; instead we brought 3 bottles of wine for corkage).......still, that's really not that bad, considering my husband recently went to Jacob's with a buddy and they spent about as much money, just for TWO people. Although: me/hubby shared a steak at Morton's and so did my mom/brother. So....it depends!

Service was mixed; at one point the waitress disappeared for awhile which kind of annoyed us. Also, check out this transparent money grab...they ask for your dessert order BEFORE dinner because \"they take awhile to cook'. Okay, that makes sense when you're talking about souffle (which Mortons offers in multiple flavours) but a chocolate cake or fudge sundae?? Are you really cooking those from scratch every time? So basically they wanna lock you into dessert while you're still hungry. Clever ploy. And it worked :)

Classic joint. Recommended."}
{"text":"Staff - OUTSTANDING 
I enjoyed the staff at Morton's. They were very friendly and there was never a point where I had to wait on food or beverages. Service was extremely quick.  

ATMOSHPERE - NICE 
It was not as dark as the other Morton's that I have been to, maybe it was a safety issue, but I think it took away from the atmosphere. The entire restaurant, from the parking lot to the restrooms as well as the dining area were impeccably clean.  

FOOD - OKAY
The appetizer that my husband and I had was the Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella. It was very good. I'd order it again. My main dish was the Cajun steak, which was over flavored and very chewy. 

OVERALL - I would go back to this restaurant. I think everyone has a bad day and maybe I got the chef on his. I do appreciate the staff and their willingness to serve. They have great energy."}
{"text":"I can't wait for the day I walk away from a $120/person steak dinner feeling like I got what I paid for.  This wasn't it."}
{"text":"I came here for Pittsburgh Restaurant week 2018.
I never heard of this place until a friend suggested I try it out. I was looking for new and exciting places to try and this was a great opportunity too!
Me and my boyfriend got a reservation and JR modem n with both feet....
First of all the service was phenomenal! Best I have experienced at top notch restaurants. Our server was so polite and on top of everything. Before we could ask for something he was on top of it. 
We ordered 2 cocktails to start I had a traditional cosmo and he had the sangria which were delicious and had the right another by if alcohol in them.
As for the meal, even though we had a limited menu everything we got was great! He got the French onion soup which looked amazing. I'm not a fan of French onion soup but there was a nice pile of ooooie goodie cheese on top which met me approval. He couldn't shovel it in fast enough lol.
We both got the filet minon. I got a side of jumbo asparagus and he got the sour cream mash potatoes. The steak was perfect! It melted I. Your mouth like butter. It has to be in my top 3 of filet minon I have ever had. The asparagus was slightly to crunchy for my taste but delicious anyway.
For desert we got the Creme brûlée. Man was it so good. Perfect sugary crust with a silky textured custard and topped with 3 raspberries. 
I would love to go back but it's a bit pricey for me to do all the time but if you want to try it Pittsburgh restaurant week was perfect time to try it. Plus everything I saw come out of that kitchen looked stunning"}
{"text":"Not a fan!

We came here for dinner on Valentine's Day for a lil \"splurge\". For appetizer, we ordered the bacon wrapped scallop, can't go wrong with greasy fatty bacon! Then we each got the \"surf n turf\" special: lobster tail with 6oz fillet mignon. The lobster tail was decent, definitely previously frozen but my fillet was noticeably bad. The meat was dry and stringy, very low quality. The bacon onion sprouts side was pretty good. When it came to dessert time, we got the malten chocolate cake, which was one of the worst I had in my life. The cake tasted powdery and overly dry, the fudge in the center was overly sweet and tasted worse then the hersey fudge from the grocery store. 

The service was attentive, which is the only thing preventing me for giving a 1 star review. The meal came out to $168 before tips, which is a rip off considering what we got. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food. We had the Filet Minion. The lobster bisque and Bibb lettuce salad were great starters and we shared a to die for chocolate soufflé. Our waitress Shawna was absolutely amazing!!!! Over all a wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"The bread they serve is very dry.  What would one expect from the only \"free\" item served?

The Cajun Ribeye is incredible and worth the $49.  It basically melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"On our return to Las Vegas, this time for my wife's participation in the \"Rock & Roll Marathon\", I decided I wanted steak.  I was going to suggest Lawry's across the street from where we were staying, but I discovered my mother in law doesn't eat beef and my wife didn't want to go to McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant (that is where we went to the last time we where in town).  I had heard about Morton's and called them to see if they served anything other than steaks - they do (yay)!  They have valet parking, but we parked ourselves in the back where the parking is shared with other establishments (Bucca di Beppo).  Inside the lighting was a bit low and they had candles at each table.  The girl at the front that greeted us  seemed indecisive, but asked us to wait where another host greeted us warmly and took us to our seats.  At this point didn't have menus, which I thought was a bit odd, but our server showed up with a big tray giving us an idea of the cuts of meat available mentioned on the menu - VERY nice.  It took a lot of guess work out of ordering.   I ordered the Chicago cut which has the bone in the meat and had it cooked medium rare.  I also ordered mash potatoes and the Morton's Salad (both of these with my wife).  

My wife had a smaller cut without the bone (8 oz) with asparagus, and crab cakes, cooked medium.  

My mother in law ordered the sea bass and had some of my wife's salad (which was half of mine) and some mash potatoes.  

After we ordered our server gave us some fresh baked onion bread and some butter.  

When our food arrived it was cooked to perfection.  

My wife and mother in law enjoyed theirs as well, although my wife seemed to enjoy mine better than hers.  Personally I believe the fact that I choose to have mine cooked medium rare is the reason why, she prefers her's well done.  

In summary, Morton's is fantastic.  VERY expensive and I plan to return only if I have a very good reason (i.e. Anniversary)."}
{"text":"Wine was great!! Our table had lobsters and steaks. The steaks where perfect. The lobsters seemed a little chewy and maybe a tad over cooked! The deserts where amazing too! The carrot cake and the lava one were the best. Just disappointed with the lobster we had 3 at our table and 2 lobster tails and they all were over cooked."}
{"text":"Morton's Steakhouse never disappoints. My husband and I frequent Morton's for various special occasion and when we just crave a melt-in-your-mouth steak. My husband likes his steaks well done so, as you can imagine, at other steakhouses they flat-iron it, butter-fly it or just cook it until it's a tough briquette. Morton's, on the other hand, always prepares his perfectly- tender but well done. The staff is always welcoming, knowledgeable and very attentive. The atmosphere is dressy casual with an old school elegance and charm. And don't be fooled~ although it's a steakhouse they have a wide variety of menu options including plenty of seafood, extensive wine & drink list as well as some very decadent desserts."}
{"text":"I kind of feel bad for posting this because not just our experience but a few tables around us experience was just as bad. Ir was my wife's and i anniversary and we sat in the bar area this past Saturday night, which we always do when we go out. We sat down and the male waiter took 10 minutes to take our order, he was preoccupied/talking with the table next to us who we could tell were regulars. Ordered our drinks and the shrimp app at the same time. It took the shrimp app 34 minutes to arrive, the waiter was very apologetic he said \"he thought the apps were coming out of the front of the kitchen and they were actually coming out of the back part of the kitchen\". The shrimp app was very good we bothed enjoyed it. We then ordered a bottle of wine which took 17 minutes to get, i actually had to ask the bartender where it was, cause our waiter was again talking to the regulars. So we went ahead and ordered the 2nd course my wife ordered the chopped salad and I ordered the lobster bisque. Again, it took forever to get the 2nd course, the salad was very very good my lobster bisque had 3 small pieces of lobster, it was luke warm and no taste. The used waaaay to much heavy cream.  I sent it back and ordered the salad. After all of this we gave up and left. While we were there though another regular came in and sat at the bar and ordered a drink and an app, after some time he stood up and said \"this is ridiculous, its taking waaaay to long to get my oysters\" and he just left. Another table besides us had an issue and left also, although I think they were just veryyyyy needy, cheap and way out of place. Now they did give us a $20 discount which was nice but my 1 drink cost that much. I could tell it was an off night for everyone it seemed, but being our first time to a Mortons we were very disappointed. There is a Ruth Chris and Del Friscos right by where we live that we frequent often and we were hoping to add another selection to our steakhouse restaurants."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now and are starting to see a decline in service. With our last visit, our server seemed to be chemically altered - bizarrely jittery and loudly talkative, fidgety, and always took a very long time to come back to the table, and too chatty when they did ... As in awkwardly chatty, just very off. It was actually uncomfortable.

Our steaks - medium rare ribeye and new York strip were absolutely phenomenal, best we've ever had. 

Our side was the potatoes which were, as they have been on every visit, one hundred percent underwhelming and not worth what you pay at all. We've also tried their salads, also just okay. When you're spending almost $20 on a side for two people, you should be getting better than soggy warm lettuce and potatoes that taste like they're out of a box.

The drinks were fantastic, kudos to the bartender. 

This place is very cozy and clean, very high end, and everything is a la carte, so be prepared to spend some money.

The steak is worth the price, the sides are not. Service was less than great. Four stars because the steak was literally amazing, it's worth a visit for that alone."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start ! Lol this restaurant has become my favorite it's two Mormons in New York but this location knocked my socks off ! The customer service was excellent ! They treated us like royalty we had such a fantastic meal .  The chef Mike held no punches our meals were so perfect so much so that we asked to meet the chef and tell him how amazing and talented he was .  Can't wait to come back to Cleveland just to eat here"}
{"text":"I've been to this Morton's twice so I'm comfortable in providing my thoughts. Please note that on both of my visits I ate at the bar so my comments below reflect my experience. 

From a food quality and atmosphere perspective I would give them a solid 4. Candidly, I don't see much difference between Morton's and any of the other high end chain steak houses, ie., Ruth Chris, Prime, etc. There is only so much you can do with a steak. 

The side items are all al la carte and pricy, however the portion sizes are reflective of the price. As would be expected there is an extensive wine list and it also reflects typical restaurant mark-ups.

What I was not overwhelmed with was the staff. Don't get me wrong, they were efficient and did their jobs, however on both of my visits there was an air of arrogance from the bar staff. Absent was any kind of sincere smile or \"welcome, great that you've selected us for dinner\", or \"can I suggest a nice desert tonight\", etc. I think this is where the independent steak houses excel; they really make you feel welcome, especially when sitting at the bar. 

The net/net, this Morton's is a very good place for a steak, but it lacks the total package from a service perspective that I would expect when paying the prices they charge."}
{"text":"This place has a very good atmosphere. Good lighting and attitude from employees. Great service never waited long for anything. Complimentary photo and dessert for our anniversary we were celebrating. I was a little surprised at having to return my 60$ steak for being undercooked but was fix and returned without any problem and waiter genuinely agreed and apologized even though I told him it was unneeded. Being at multiple high end steakhouses it's not on my top but definitely the bottom either    ."}
{"text":"The service was great- our group of 6 was really well taken care of.  We went in December of 2014 just after they had re-opened from the fire.  A few things we ordered weren't available, and as former service employee myself I understand how it will take a bit of time for them to make sure they are fully stocked.  I did not pay the bill, but someone from the management team came out and said they'd take care of a few things for us, which was very generous. We also requested to move tables because of a cold draft from the entry doors and they did that for us as well.

Never having eaten here before, I felt the food was very average for the above-average prices we paid.  Our server was very knowledgeable about everything and had great suggestions.  Our appetizers were good (scallops and wrapped cheese).  The best part of the meal was the endive salad I had, a special that particular time, and very interesting combination of flavors. The sides we ordered were a black truffle cauliflower (a special) and au gratin potatoes. The potatoes were really lackluster and all 6 of us probably only ate half of them.  Stuff I make at home is tastier.  The cauliflower was ok.

For the meal I had the mixed grill- shrimp and crab cake.  Lacked flavor and was very average at best.  I've had many crabcakes in my day and this was no better than a $8 crabcake at Red Lobster (that is probably at least 75% cheaper too).  The price tag was so over the top for what I got with this entree. 

Dessert was a joke- a chocolate cake that was SO boring in taste and flavor.  It was like some sort of frozen dessert I'd buy at Giant Eagle & warm up in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Overall the speed was a bit slow too, but I know sometimes they do that on purpose to give you time to enjoy the atmosphere, which was pleasant.  

Often I find it worthwhile to pay more for a meal if you get a wonderful mix of flavors that you usually can't recreate at home yourself, something that satisfies the palate. This dinner left me feeling full but not satisfied."}
{"text":"The manager contacted me after this post and offered to remake my meal. I found out they accidentally gave me crab instead of lobster the 1st time...hence the fishy smell. The second time around the steak was well prepared. Lobster was ok, not the best out there and not the worst. 

I ate there a 3rd time, and chose to dine in. The food overall was good. Had the Porterhouse topped with crab and asparagus, Parmesan & Truffle Matchstick Fries, Five Onion Soup, Double Chocolate Mousse. The porterhouse was alright, the server asked if we would like it a little blackened...I don't recommend this. It was burnt on the outside and it didn't help the steak. The crab and asparagus topping was very dry and the crab was definitely fishy again. The fries were average, however the five onion soup was one of the best french onion soups I have ever had. Would highly recommend it! The mousse was also really good!

So why 3 stars instead of 4 or 5? Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, etc  have a better steak...and overall their side dishes are better. Also, the atmosphere in the other restaurants are more upbeat and nicer decor."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week and brought some friends. From the beginning the server seemed a little turned off when we ordered from the special menu. I know it's a little less but we bought bottles of wine as well and didn't think we deserved the rushed service he was providing. Really great steaks some of the best I have had. Also the open kitchen is really neat to watch. My girlfriend had the soufflé which was incredible. I have to say great food which you would expect from Mortons, but really disappointed with the staff.l which seems to be common reading other reviews."}
{"text":"Top notch service as usual.  As usual, I had the cajun ribeye, loaded baked potatoe, lobster bisque, and hot chocolate cake.  Magnificent.  Morton's does it right every single time."}
{"text":"Romantic atmosphere.  Great service.  Excellent cajun ribeye steak."}
{"text":"Well my benefactor/boyfriend, took me out last night for Valentine's to Morton's Steakhouse and boy was I in for a treat. Just to witness the excellent service and all that delicious being served in such large quantities made my heart warm. He ordered some very expensive wine bottles two in fact--the wine selection is huge! Oh well a once in a year or two year occasion. Why oh why are all steakhouses so noisy? That's the only drawback the noise--my sensitive ears just can't take it sometimes. They topped off the night with a personalized photo of the two of us and a card. Truly a wonderful night indeed."}
{"text":"The happy hour Bar Bites are solid value and realistically, if solo, a good dinner option. 

We dined in the dining room, service was 5*, our steaks were prepared perfectly. The pea pods, horseradish mashed potatoes and wild mushroom side dishes were great. The chocolate soufflé was ok, a bit mushy. I'll ask next time for less seasoned salt on the steak. Overall a really good dining experience. It's also near the casino, walked over after dinner for an hour and enjoyed the activity."}
{"text":"The service started out great until it took a while to get drinks, appetizers, our meal then our check.  

Their wine menu had a 2014 Stags Leap which they were promoting so we ordered a bottle but ended up getting the 2015.  I didn't realize it was the wrong vintage until half way through the bottle but no big deal.  

The tuna tower finally arrived and was a joke, don't waste your money.  Not sure if they changed chefs or not but it wasn't what we had before.  When the steaks finally arrived, the staff was auctioning off our steaks, it seemed as if the staff was unsure of which order belonged to which guests.  When we cut into the steaks, they were over cooked so they prepared 2 new steaks which came out the way we ordered them along with new sides.  

Our checks took anywhere from 35-45 minutes to get after our table was cleared.  One of the couples in our party had to leave early and was in the process of telling our waitress what they had and she told them \"that's not gonna help\" and just walk away.  Because of her response, she messed up everyone's check hence the reason for the delay with our check.

This could've easily been avoided from the beginning by asking who was on which check but she never bothered to ask.  This is unexceptionable at an establishment that's charging these prices.  

I've been in this business before and if my guests were spending THOUSANDS on a meal, my servers would ONLY focus on this table to make sure everything was correct.  I'm very disappointed with the service of an establishment of this caliber.  

Needless to say, we WON'T be back."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Went there on New Year's Eve at 5 PM. There was literally no other people in the restaurant. We had a party of 7. The service was slow. Didn't bring us more water after asking a few times. Ordered a few steaks, one medium, the other two medium rare and they arrived not even hot and all of them seemed to be just a little more cooked than rare. 

Way overpriced. Will never go to this Morton's or any others."}
{"text":"I always overall rate my restaurant reviews based mainly on the enjoyment of of the food and taste.  My meal was exceptionally very good except it fell short of a 5 star for the following reasons:

- House salad had too much blue cheese.  Some is okay, but it was overkill.
- Appetizer bread was full of onions...horrible aftertaste.
- Mashed potatoes and green beans were full of too much garlic.

My steak was cooked to perfection and so was my main lobster appetizer.  They were excellent and also main course of meal.  The sides and overkill of onions / garlic needs work. I will come back again."}
{"text":"I wish there were more stars to give this restaurant. My sisters and I gave my parents a 45th Wedding Anniversary with 20 guests. They took care of ALL of our wants and needs. The staff members are very nice. Everyone enjoyed themselves and it was a The food wad delicious. Great Night for everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"So we took our buddy here as a \"going away dinner\". He got married. So it was bittersweet... for him. Good dinner, but you're getting married
dude. Sorry.
As for us single guys... We paid and enjoyed a fine meal to send our buddy off.

I started off with the Morton's salad, which was a salad at best. Nothing spectacular or outta the ordinary. The anchovy in the salad did make it just a lil'  better, just a lil'. 

As for the main course: IT WAS BONER INDUCING. I'm talkin' \"Hugh Hef needin' mad Viaga Status\".

Crab cakes were on the menu so I said, \"garcon, crab cakes por favor\"... These \"cakes\" were nothing but crab. No cake what so ever! Usually it's the other way around where it's nothing but \"CAKE\", herbs and spices. But damn, these \"cakes\" were crab overload! They were served with an aioli on the side but that did not enhance the crab. Just a squeeze o' lemon and it was sexy time!

Again my eyes saw Double Cut Filet Mignon. So I said, \"garcon, double cut phil-ette mig-non\".   I'm not a big fan of filet but I was compelled to order it. I like my steak on the rare side of medium rare. It was cooked just the way I Iikes it . I was in steak nirvana. I cut thin slices and I was thinking, \"should I put some in my shirt pocket for later?\"  No later. I ravaged that cut. 

Dessert is not my thing... However, my friend was going to get married and it would have been an odd thing not to order when everyone else was doing it too. Damn peer pressure. LEGENDARY CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!!! I was freakin' speechless! They should make a movie outta this cake with merchandise and all.

We painted the town red that week and did some mad damage. Thanks Vegas..."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite steak places to go to in Cleveland ever since the filet sandwich at the Cleveland Wine Festival (which sadly RIP)... but the quality I remember didn't quite match up this time... Maybe since I haven't been here in quite awhile but still. The customer service is excellent and deserves a 5 star. Our waitress was great except the drink menu didn't state pricing so we asked prior to ordering, and instead of finding out she guessed the prices for us only to find them on our bill for $5 higher. The drinks were ok, but definitely not worth the extra $10 totaling us to $30 for 2.  

We had a creamy butter on a dish come out alongside a giant onion bread ball .. The inside was hot and fluffy and it was delicious. 

They had a great deal 3 courses for $36 for the July 4th holiday week...And considering the price of just our entrees alone were atleast $36 it was pretty cheap compared to normal days. 

My beginning course for the special was a five onion soup. It did specify in a cup so it isn't the usual size you think of for French onion crocks. But the flavor was amazing and it's one of the best I've had I must say. 

For my entree I ordered the filet mignon rare.. It came cooked perfectly, and very tender, just didn't have much flavor to it aside from the A1 i smothered it in. 

Our sides were pretty huge and I got a horseradish mashed potato. Again not much flavor but decent nonetheless. I got super full fast from everything so was only able to have a few bites from my potatoes. 

I also had ordered the escargot... I'm a snail lover I guess. I order it everywhere I see it on the menu. Wasn't as great as last time.. It's served underneath a puff pastry in a butter sauce which isn't bad but I can do without that next time. I suppose it gives the slimy part a bit of a crunch to go with it but, eh. Escargot are good alone to me, but my boyfriend told me otherwise lol. 

Our dessert we got to go... Which I found out was literally just a mousse topping... I assumed it was a mousse cake but I should stop assuming and maybe ask next time. Wasn't bad but wouldn't pick it next time. 

My only downfall was the price of the meal.. It's a bit too high for the quality. And also when our leftovers were bagged up they only gave one of our sides when we clearly had double what we brought home. So I don't feel I got my money's worth. 

All in all it was a good experience. Loved the waitress, food not bad, and the inside was very nice. (My favorite was the dead pig lamp centerpieces on the table lol)"}
{"text":"Here for a birthday dinner for my fiance and having been to a few other Morton locations I knew what I was in store for.  And that is delicious steaks, insane deserts and outstanding service.  At least those are the things I always walk away from the place remembering.

This location is no different, great staff and comfortable atmosphere to relax with no rush to dining.

The parking is pretty non existent here so I suggest valet."}
{"text":"My family and I came here to celebrate my sister's graduation! It doesn't have a grand entrance and looks kinda like a normal hole-in-the-wall restaurant since you have to go through a couple doors to get to the actual restaurant. 

Pros: The food, service, and ambience is great. We ordered so much food and had a bunch of leftovers. I, personally, ordered the cajun ribeye and it was cooked perfectly medium rare and FULL of flavor. We also got many sides, such as truffle fries, hashbrowns, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. The truffle fries were yummy, but the hashbrowns were soaked in oil. I did like the mac and cheese though! I didn't get to try the mashed potatoes or brussel sprouts. We got the hot chocolate cake and the lemon souffle for dessert. The hot chocolate cake was delicious. It comes with raspberries on top, caramel drizzle, and a scoop of ice cream on the side. Definitely WORTH. The souffle was light and fluffy! A big contrast to the chocolate cake. Oh yeah, and the bread they give you to start is AMAZING. It's crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. That stuff is soo good. 

Cons: It was noisier than expected; since it's a classy place you'd expect there to be soft jazz and people having intimate, quiet conversations. However, it was quite loud. And of course, the prices are very, very steep, but that's expected of a steakhouse. 

Overall: This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion if you're willing to splurge! The food is so great and flavorful. Overall, my experience at Morton's was awesome, and I will be back."}
{"text":"I understand that large parties take longer to serve but 3+ hours to dine is completely ridiculous. I watched our waitress serve, grab checks, refill drinks, and bring back checks before they came back to fill my glass of melted ice. We actually had to go to the bar to order drinks because both of our waitresses were missing. It took about an hour for them to clear our empty appetizer dishes out of our way. I ordered the porterhouse medium and it came out well done with the edges crispy. This was two hours into the meal so I decided to leave it alone. When my friend mentioned my steak, the waitress immediately fixed the issue. All i could see was nasty looks from the cooks after this issue. I saw them pointing over to our table and had the most disgusted looks on their faces. The whole experience was unpleasant. 

My friend wanted to save the candles from her birthday cake and she asked our waitress if she could bring a napkin to the table for us. She told us that they don't bring bar napkins to the table but she will this time. Like seriously. We collectively spent over 1000 at the table and you can't bring us a disposable napkin without a snide remark? There were also multiple times where the waitress gave other rude remarks about their food as if we are oblivious to how a steakhouse works. Mind you, there were 2 chefs at our table. The attitudes of everyone in there wasn't worth the meal or the experience. 

The oysters were good. The porterhouse was great after they finally cooked it right. I'll never go back though."}
{"text":"I wanted a soufflé! 

First, let's start from the end.  I love dessert.  It really should be the fourth meal (sorry T-Bell).  If you have ever had a soufflé at any time in your life, DO NOT EAT ONE AT MORTON'S!!!  Seriously, what they served up was more like...oh, I don't know...crap.  It wasn't at all the decadent, rich and orgasmic experience you can get at Cut, Fleur de Lys or a ton of other eateries in Vegas.  It was more like a meringue with some sugar dusted on.  FAIL!

Other than that, our meal was decent.  I had the bone-in rib eye, which was juicy, but looked as if it was cooked at too low a temperature.  It had no char and was over-cooked (I ordered medium rare, but it came out about medium).  Where's the blood?!?  Seriously, if I want an overcooked $50 piece of meat, I'll do it myself.

The service did redeem the place, however.  We were not left for want by the waitstaff, and everything was nicely paced.  Even after sitting at our table for 4 hours, they were still very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"My wife and I made reservations here to celebrate 10 years dating on New Years day. Our experience was quite disappointing for what we paid and will certainly not go back. Our server took very long just to come by initially and we waited 30 mins just to get drinks when it wasn't even busy. He also seemed irritated when asking him questions and moreso over us wanting to split the 24oz porterhouse. I don't know about most, but a 48oz porterhouse for 2 seems way too much when a 24oz is around 1900 calories.  He was really trying to sell us on getting the bigger cut and decided not to, which may have ticked him off some more. We still spent the same if not more with the extra salad and seafood platter on top of the 2 sides to share we ordered. Once we got the smaller porterhouse we were quite relieved we didn't order the bigger one as we'd have taken most of it home. He took very long to come back and check on us in the beginning, though he did do good pours of wine for the wife. We also didn't get any bread nor were offered any. He even asked us if it was our first time dining there which we told him it had been. I had to mention this to the people at the front out as we were leaving quite displeased. I only asked them about the bread and mentioned the length of time it took to get our first drinks. I just feel that coming to a place like this one should expect and get reasonable service.  He tried to chat us up a bit towards the end as he probably noticed we were peed off but by then it was too late. He mentioned how busy it was the night before for New Years Eve and have been a little burnt out but don't take it out on your customers. I would have loved to save myself a lot of money and had a much better experience elsewhere. I still tipped him around 15% as I got friends in the service industry and don't prefer to stiff anyone in the business."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food melts in your mouth and is so fresh and well seasoned. Great choice for dining."}
{"text":"I can't beat it in Vegas. Of course anything that approaches value in Vegas is a really big find.  Been in many Morton's all over the country. Always  a good steak good food. Same in Vegas. You will not get professional service in LV from the waiter or mgt. You can get the server to do as you wish."}
{"text":"Love it! Great service, great food and outstanding Chocolate soufle.  What else can you say....

Tips: order the soufle when you order your entree. It takes a longgggggggggg time to cook, but it's worth the wait. You cannot repeat CANNOT share this, it's too good to share... order your own :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Morton's for quite some time and I finally went earlier this week.  I was seated promptly--it was right at opening and the place was very quiet. a big seller.

I was left a menu and brought the iced tea I wanted.  After looking at the menu, I opted for lobster bisque as a starter, the 16 ounce NY strip for a main, a baked potato for the side, and I finished dinner with their Grand Marnier soufflé which my server, Linsey, said was her favorite and ordered often.

The lobster bisque was the standout of the evening.  It ranks with the best I've had.  The bisque was very rich.  There was one larger piece of lobster and two smaller ones--about normal for lobster bisque.

I asked for the steak to be blue and it was done a bit more than that.  Their steaks are broiled and I watched the chef doing several during my stay there.  The steak was flavorful but it was nothing I can't get at a cheaper price in some of the Strip hotel steakhouses.  The baked potato was large.  Linsey put butter and sour cream and I could have had bacon, too, but I passed on that.

The soufflé was ordered at the beginning so there was plenty of time to make it.  This was the first time being served a soufflé that the server didn't ask if I wanted them to pierce the top and pour the liquid into the soufflé.  Rather, the dish was placed on my table and a small gravy boat holding the Grand Marnier sauce was placed on the side and I was told to enjoy.

Service was good.  Linsey was personable and helpful with questions.  The pace of the meal was a bit too fast.  There was only a short break between courses.  Had I been with a group of people, I would have wanted to have some down time to talk with friends.  I was out in about an hour to give an idea of how things moved along.

A couple of peeves I have.  One is a bit silly, perhaps, but I dine solo and am often seated at a table meant for four.  After the three other place settings have been removed, invariably the salt and pepper are moved to the farthest end of the table which causes me to have to stand up and do a long reach across the table to get the salt and pepper.  I'm solo.  You don't need to make extra room in the middle of the table.  The other peeve is the valet parking.  This is not a large casino where I have a long walk to get to a restaurant.  Tuesday night, every spot but the handicapped spots, had a cone placed in front of them.  You had to park either in the back and walk or on the side and walk around the wall to get to the entrance.  I guess this is a money maker but I find it terribly inconvenient and unnecessary.  I think with the prices charged here, I'm paying a lot for parking.

This is not a place to which I'd return."}
{"text":"When I was waiting for the steak , I wasn't happy at all.
It was too crowded, the ceiling is too low that makes me feel so stuffed. , 

Then the food came out . 
I ordered  a lobster with filet mignon, OMG after one bite, 
My frustration is gone. It was so tender, and tasty .

This place must be one of the best steak house in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love Morton's...don't get me wrong. i've been to many Morton's Steak Houses in the USA...I used to work for a winery and they sold some of our wines, so I have been to many of their restaurants before.  

I must say that the Toronto restaurant isn't as great as their American counterparts.  The food is very good -- it's dependable steaks cooked very well. The side dishes are always great as well....as is the dessert (souffle is always a huge treat!!).  What i was not impressed with was their appetizers.  One one trip to Morton's Toronto, we ordered the beef sliders....and the beef inside the mini buns was the size of the tip of a thumb!!! Crazy when you spend almost 20 bucks for 3 small sliders that have minuscule meat portions that can hardly be seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We wrote the management telling them what we thought and basically were given a FOD letter back...which I thought was pretty tacky given that we were complaining about the lack of portion size of their food!!!!

So, all in all, a bitter taste when it comes to Morton's Toronto.  Still giving it 3 stars because the maincourse meals were good...but a big \"poo-poo\" to the mini-appetizer and the management response!"}
{"text":"For the price you pay at Mortons, you'd think the fish would be wild caught.  All the fish on their menu are Farm Raised.  \"Wild Atlantic Salmon\" is not wild, it's farm raised.  Shame on you Mortons for charging us premium pricing but delivering the same quality product I could get at the Captains Galley."}
{"text":"Morton's is not what it used to be.  Steaks were great, service was terrible. It appears service is very inconsistent and at a steakhouse of this caliber you should be able to count on the service.  I would suggest more training and also perhaps caring about reviews.  
Why ask for feedback, if you don't care."}
{"text":"I've always had consistent quality of food and service here.  

Standard menu....everything is a la carte.  I've been to this specific location about half a dozen times....

I recommend City Hall or Mastro's (N. Scottsdale), over Morton's.  But between Fleming's and here, it's a tossup.  I would eat at either....but I would probably choose Fleming's over Morton's."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.  First off, we sat at the booth near where the host has his podium.  He seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable.  

I did like the nice touch of having my name printed on the menu and service by our waitress was good.  However, food wise, it was just OK and a bit disappointing.  I of course had filet, and I was just so underwhelmed with it.  The flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring.  

After this experience, I have no desire to ever come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Morton's is a great place to celebrate a special occasion.  We went for our wedding anniversary.

We had a nice booth, very cosy and intimate.

Also, just a tip but if you go to the Morton's website and register for it, they have a special offer for a Steak and Seafood dinner for two (which is quite a good price considering all you get).

We did have this and it includes:

2 kinds of salad 
3 different appetizers (including shrimp, scallops or crabcake)
2 single filets each (8 oz)
3 different choices for dessert including a molten chocolate cake which was wonderful.

The service was great -- the ambiance warm and cozy -- and the food was wonderful.

As it happens -- it was a lot  -- we were stuffed when we left -- but happily so.

So -- if you are looking for an upscale steakhouse, I would recommend this place.

BTW -- they do offer some wines by the glace, and have some good bottles on offer (although not inexpensive)."}
{"text":"Morton's has a my favorite steakhouse. Whether it's the location in Las Vegas, New York, or San Diego, the quality is always excellent!"}
{"text":"It is OK, but overpriced by a mile for what is not even comparable to a chain restaurant in Canada called The Keg. About double the price. Great service but that has to be expected at this price. The food is just \"so so\" which is a big let down versus other Morton's locations that I have been to that are first class."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC.  

I came here with my wedding party late in the evening, maybe a half hour before they closed - the treatment we got was terrific!  From seating (they pulled the table out of the booth for us), to wine recommendation, then appetizers - wow. 
The server was on TOP of it, gracious and we were very well attended. The manager was extremely friendly and genuinely cared how our event went, and it showed. 
I enjoyed every bit of the food, and it was less expensive than I anticipated. 
Side note:  I bought a gift card for one of my staff when she got married and she had a good experience here as well - and all this came from a local friend of mines recommendation - will come here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The steak here is amazing! I have been to this place on a couple different special occasions and it always seems to impress. Their main dining menu is wonderful, and although it is pricy, the food is worth the price. Also, the service here is always top of the line. 

Morton's also has an AMAZING happy hour. If you are looking for the quality of Morton's at a lower price, I would highly recommend their happy hour. They offer small plates as well as selected alcoholic beverages for a low price. I know the hours of this varies by location, and the hours of happy hour can be found online!

Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst steak house ever . The food was sub par . We waited ten minutes for water . Our Mac n cheese was cold !! My fiancée steak was solid Luke warm fat. The dessert was below average . Stay away there are far better steak houses in the valley ."}
{"text":"We brought in a party of 22, having arranged the gathering about a week out. We asked for a private room and we were ready to spend money. I love Morton's Steakhouse. I have been to several around the country. Their molton lava cake is my favorite dessert stateside. We were really looking forward to the meal.

They dropped the ball big-time. We had only 2 servers in a private room with over 20 people. Things fell apart rather quickly. We were seated at 2 tables, and each table had its own problems. It is pretty simple. We have these dinners all over the country. The servers were inattentive. While there were plates of butter on the table when we arrived, we were never given bread until we finally asked when we realized how slow the service was becoming. Other places we have gone, there are people watching and making sure your glass is never empty. We had to keep asking for refills and other attentions we are used to being automatic when we have such gatherings. They served different things to the two tables at different times, to where we would have to check and see what the other table had that we did not. The food was delayed because they would burn the order and have to start over again, and some of the steaks I saw come out were not to the desired temperature, and a few were burnt. A disappointing experience overall. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place . Have been coming for 25 years it's always been great. Service is always the best. Kevin will always take of you and service at the bar is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I had brought the carrot cake home (at the urging of the waitress - she was right!) and after a night in the fridge, it tasted MUCH better! The frosting was my favorite (not too sweet, good texture). The review still stands, but I would recommend the carrot cake again."}
{"text":"Still the best steakhouse in Charlotte. 

Great service, great food, great ambiance. There are other good steakhouses in the area but with the closest competition (Mcintosh) closed, this is the best in Charlotte.

I have never had a bad meal here. It is consistently excellent. The strip, filet , lobster, etc. -all good."}
{"text":"Bumped it up a notch. Gave it some more thought and the food alone was incredible, service impeccable and the ambiance wonderful. I guess I was a tad harsher than I am on lower end steak houses. Although the prices were high, it was a great night out."}
{"text":"This was a terrible horrible experience this evening and I will never go to this Mortons again. I was sitting in the bar when a guy in dirty jeans and a t-shirt was so drunk at the bar he fell off his bar stool and I had to pick up the stools. I decided this situation was not going to get better so I left before ordering.  I walked out and phoned the manager and told him that I was upset that they served this guy until he was totally intoxicated and could not even walk out of there.  He apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone.  I walked up and he was still staggering around outside and I walked in.  Rich said he was sorry and I sat back at the bar and he wanted to buy me an appetizer and a drink and I said okay.  The bartender never came back to me to take my drink order.  I decided to leave and the manager was outside still trying to take care of the situation with the drunk with the police. He saw me leave and I shook his hand and said thanks anyway and I walk away and when all else fails HOOTERS makes a mean chicken wing but would of rather had my Filet and Broccoli

Oh Well"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte in 1996 Morton's was the best restaurant in town.  Since then alot more restaurants have opened up.  I no longer live in Charlotte and I have ate at other Morton's but the Charlotte one is still the best.

I am not really sure what sets it apart.  No matter what city I am in Morton's is always the best place for Steak.  I have been to other places like the Palm (in Charlotte and NY) and I always feel rushed. Morton's makes dining out an experience and it is always fun. The menu presentation is always a  highlight.  

I once had a Christmas party for my team in one of the rooms. We had a great time and the staff treated us very well.

Do not fall into the trap of ordering the dessert before you get dinner.   This is a rookie mistake.   If you want dessert after your meal there are still plenty of options and I think they are better than the warm Godiva popup that is suggested at the begining of the meal."}
{"text":"Food is great, prices are high.  What can I say, it's MORTON'S!  The portions are huge but the waiters are so nice they will split any dish for you.   Trust me, splitting a dish still gives you a healthy \"proper\" portion size.  The meats are huge, the Salad's are huge, the potato was the size of my two fists side by side! and the dessert was very sharable.  Your bill will be more reasonable if you split the entree.  :)

The bonus on our visit was that waitress was the sweetest, most helpful, kind, and patient wait staff I've EVER dealt with.   Even with all our quirky \"split this\", \"does that have egg in it?\" and \"can we get that on the side?\" questions and requests.  She had a great attitude and a lovely smile on her face throughout our visit.

By the way, the happy hour menu looks pretty fantastic but we weren't in Vegas long enough to go back and try it.  I will definately do that if I go back."}
{"text":"Probably the most underwhelming of the private group steakhouse dinners that I've been to.

I was invited to attend a dinner at Morton's The Steakhouse with a modified version of the Silver Menu, the lowest cost tier of their private dinner menu (as published on their web site: http://www.mortons.com/private_dining/menus/PDR_for_Web_12_16.pdf). The differences included lack of hors d'oeuvres and only one dessert selection. As with my other recent experiences, I did not have any personal expenses for this occasion.

Service was good, as I've come to expect. Plates and utensils were delivered and removed efficiently and unobtrusively. I would've been glad to be informed that only one drink portion would be available, but at least I was able to get out quickly and safely after consuming my delicious Cabernet early on. Pleasant, non-Stumptown-y coffee (their beans are always too acrid for me) at the end also helped, and the server obliged when I changed my mind after they made their rounds.

Atmosphere was better. Music was low. More importantly, the private room was rather well-lit and, for whatever reason, remained that way. That's always a plus whether you're taking photos for Yelp or just trying to see the color of the interior of your steak. Oh, and the restroom was clean and also quiet.

The complimentary bread and butter was actually really nice. The bread was crunchy and fluffy, with onion bits on top, and the butter was light and tastier than usual.

First dish to arrive was the Caesar Salad. It was very simple, with one medium-sized crunchy slice of bread as a crouton and no meat or anything. All the lettuce was fresh and crispy, and the dressing was even and not too heavy, but it was ordinary compared to what I've had at other chain steakhouses.

The main course came next. Of course I ignored the salmon and chicken dishes, choosing the 8 oz. Filet Mignon as any reasonable person (sans dietary concerns) would do in a steakhouse. I had mine cooked medium-rare and decided to say yes when the server asked if I wanted it red in the middle, and the steak came out cooked exactly that way, to my surprise. Unfortunately, the flavor was a little lacking as I've come to expect from most filets, and the beef wasn't even that tender. Definitely the least impressive of my recent steakhouse entrees.

We had two sides. Sauteed Garlic Green Beans, presented on the same plate as the entree, were crunchy but bland. \"Twice Baked\" Au Gratin Potatoes were served family-style and were delicious as cheesy potatoes usually are. I would've definitely cleaned the plate if there weren't so many people at the table.

Dessert was Cheesecake. It was really delicious, and it almost convinced me to up my rating. The cake was sweet but not overly so, and the crust had a surprising crispiness at the bottom. The half-strawberry garnish was a little pale, but made up for lack of redness with ideal sweetness and bursting-ness.

Dinner at Morton's in a private dining format was not bad overall, but I can't be a fan when the steak is mildly disappointing, the star is a sometimes-skippable course, and the other standouts are just supporting cast. I doubt that I'll return except for special deals, such as the $1 filet mignon sliders that I faintly recall trying and not especially loving on \"National Filet Mignon Day\" last year."}
{"text":"I am in town currently on business and I usually try to go to Morton's wherever I am in the country. This one is just as nice as any other. 

I sat at the bar and ordered a Caesar salad, and a 8oz filet. Both items were delicious and the steak was cooked as ordered.

The service was great as well. I was the only person at the bar though. 

The location is a bit strange, in what seems like a dumpy part of town, at least in the eyes of an out-of-towner, but the inside was very nice. They do offer valet parking for all of the up-front parking spaces, and self park is in the back. 

I'll probably go back tonight."}
{"text":"I've been to the Morton's in the Biltmore area several times and just loved it. Perfect every time. So when the boyfriend's mom wanted a steak dinner for Mother's Day of course our first choice was Morton's. Although we shouldn't have strayed from the Biltmore location.

I'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good. I think it's really good. I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious. Their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp I've ever had, their filet mignon is always cooked to perfection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it, it is simply divine. We also indulged in their chocolate cake which is always very tasty.

The reason I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got. From the very beginning our server seemed distracted and rushed. When she was giving the presentation she kept looking away like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else. I know you have the script memorized but that is just rude. Look at us when you're talking to us! Throughout the meal she would race by and walk away before we could even answer if \"everything was okay.\" I was very disappointed in her lack of attention.

This location also feels much more casual than Biltmore's. I guess I'm old fashioned but when I go out for a steak dinner I get dressed up. Many people here were in khaki shorts and polos.

Next time we're craving a Morton's steak, we'll be heading back to the Biltmore location where they know how to give excellent service, every time."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Morton's. The boyfriend and I celebrated Valentine's Day there last weekend and we could not have had a better experience.

We saw on their website that they are running a special -$99 dinner for two. What an amazing deal. You get salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert! You cannot beat it.

We each started with a caesar salad, which was huge! It was very good - not too heavy on the dressing. But I didn't want to eat too much because I knew we had so much more coming.
The deal comes with a half filet mignon for each person which is still a good size portion and your choice of seafood on the side. I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and boyfriend ordered the shrimp. Each came in an order of three so we shared. The steak was done just right, it was so tender and tasty. And the seafood was amazing. The shrimp was in this buttery sauce that I just loved. It was almost better than the steak. 
For our sides we chose potatoes lyonaisse (sp?) and sauteed mushrooms. The potatoes were tasty and the mushrooms were a great compliment to the steak - a really nice combo.
For dessert we each got a piece of their chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream - very rich and very good. The cake was moist and the ice cream helped cut the richness of the fudge.

I think some of the servings may have been smaller (like if you ordered the shrimp as an appetizer I think you get more than 3) but it was still more food than we could finish. We took a good portion of it all home and ate it as part of a meal the next day.

The service was excellent, and the atmosphere pleasant.  The only thing I didn't think was up to par was the bread. It's a big loaf of onion bread that was a little hard to cut and it just wasn't that great. Rolls would be better but hey, you don't want to fill up on bread anyway right? So not a big deal.

Morton's is perfect for a special occasion or if you just want to make an occasion special."}
{"text":"If you like food consistency, then Morton's is for you.  The menu has been the same for as long as I can remember, but the food is always good.  

I'm over the table-side presentation; pretty familiar with what broccoli and a potato look like.  Our waiter was so nervous trying to remember his script.  I pointed to the menu and ordered the Lobster Bisque (deliciously creamy with heat from white pepper) and the appetizer Shrimp Alexander.  Was served the dinner portion of the shrimp, but didn't make a fuss since it was my husband's birthday.  

They did a nice job for my husband's birthday with pretty sprinkles on the table and birthday printed menus and desert.  He loved his filet."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars -- It's good - expensive and good - not great - you pay a lot for sides - use to go to the one uptown all the time - sometimes for the seafood more than the steak - service is slow on weekends- When you can go and eat a steak without sauce - (A1-57) - you know it's a good steak"}
{"text":"Money, Class & Swagger. 

Morton's is a fine dining establishment specializing in... you guessed it, STEAKS! My first experience with the famed steakhouse connected to the Ritz-Carlton was my first glimpse into the life of the rich and famous. A life I'd only known previously from the imagery conjured up by Robin Leach. 

Of course at the time, I had absolutely no business going there (still don't). I was a poor, naive, school going kid who was trying to impress a date on New Years Eve, circa early 2000's. But for that very night, we were treated to absolute royalty. 

The servers were clad in tuxedo's. The atmosphere, with it's rich mahogany trim reminded me of an exclusively posh men's club. In the dimly lit dining room, we walked past a table with Brian Billick and a few members of the Baltimore Ravens who were in town to play the Browns the next day. Waiters rolled out elaborate carts of meat and seafood (including live Lobster) to offer first-hand examples of the various cuts available. The wow factor was off the charts even before we ordered. 

It shouldn't go without saying that the food & drinks were phenomenal and the service, discreet and professional. But for the price, it should be expected. At Morton's you get what you pay for. It's a special occasion place, but when that occasion comes and you're in search of that very special dining destination, Morton's should be on your short list."}
{"text":"I like Steak. I like establishments that specialize in Steak. I like Morton's.

It had been a while since I had dinner at Morton's on paradise Road.. I dropped in recently for dinner with a buddy. I love the feel of the more 'classic style' rooms. I know that Morton's is by no means an icon on the food scene in Las Vegas, but it is definitely a nice change of pace to dining on the Strip or at one of the pricier steakhouses (which I also love, too much;) 

Morton's was recently acquired by Landry's, and thus a few things changed.. nothing really in terms of quality, just a few more promotions and a few additions to the food menu. 

I drop in for Happy Hour now and then, and sometimes for a full dinner. The room is comfortable, the drinks are stiff, and some of my favorite servers have been there for years. Every time, the staff is warm and smiling and the food is consistently good. What else can you ask for?

If you have't had a chance to go or haven't been in awhile.. stop by. I think you will find a sense of quality at Morton's that has been missing on the dining scene lately.  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Hello,

My wife and I were unfortunately in a hurry to leave last night to pick up her son from Daycare.  We were running behind schedule and did not have time to talk to the manager.

1) We chose Morton's for restaurant week.  The menu options were limited and not a great variety to choose from.

2) We ordered the 6oz Filet and also the Stuffed Shrimp and Pasta.

3) The salads were plain and nothing to write home about.  The Morton's salad and the Caesar salad were basically the same.  Even though one came with with blue cheese and egg.  there was no wow factor in the salad like Flemmings.

4) The FILET my friend ordered medium well... however it was served WELL done.  It was dry and not very tasty.  The potatoes served with the dish he ordered were not inventive or special... it was sliced potatoes with onions.  Something I would get from DENNYS!

Needless  to say the potato dish was a very big letdown

5) The stuffed shrimp...  what can i say.  Over cooked and under seasoned.  The crab stuffing (at least i think it was supposed to be crab) was tasteless.  My wife and I were not able to tell what the stuffing was supposed to be for the shrimp.  Again... this is a dish i would expect from Applebees and NOT from Mortons.

The broccoli was not cooked enough and not seasoned at all.

6) We ordered the Creme Brûlée and the Chocolate Soufflé.

The Creme Brûlée was cold... unappealing ... and far too sweet. 

The so called \"Chocolate\" Soufflé was not even chocolate in color... did not taste like chocolate and was so wet and sloppy in the center it was unpleasant to eat.

This was absolutely the WORST steak dinner experience I have had at any restaurant.  This was not our first visit to Mortons...  but it sure was not a good visit at all.  If we had more time I would have talked to the manager.  My wife was so disappointed that he just wanted to leave.

Note: someone from Morton's called me while I was driving. They wanted to apologize for the experience... However they just kept repeating that so many other people enjoy their food. However if you look at the yelp reviews... That is not the case. I think this is one of the worst rated steak houses on yelp.  Flemings, Ruth Chris and others don't have as low of an overall rating.

I am very disappointed that management never even offered to correct the situation. I am still waiting for them to call back and make this right."}
{"text":"All these new knock off steakhouses popping up around Scottsdale have NOTHING on the original and classically amazing Morton's!!!  This place is authentic from the inside out, the steaks are amazing, the staff is great, you really can't beat it. The recent remodel inside the restaurant added a fun, upbeat new atmosphere as opposed to their older classic but somewhat outdated look before. Their filet is always cooked to perfection when we go in and order it, I have only tried the NY strip & filet but I've heard great things about all the other cuts of meat as well. I love how the servers do a LIVE presentation of the steaks.  Other steakhouses/fine dining restaurant like Ocean Club & Dominic's don't even compare to them and I think the live presentation has a lot to do with that.  People like to see what they are ordering. Also, when you visit Morton's, don't forget to try their desserts.  I don't think there is a bad one on the menu!!  Please, don't waste your time going anywhere else, Morton's is the place to be! Plus, if you come in for a special occasion such as an anniversary or birthday, they give you a very nice card with your parties' picture inside signed by all the staff for free. They really go over the top!!! I will always be a Morton's fan no matter what."}
{"text":"This review is just for Morton's power hour, quite simply some of the best bar food period !! 7$ for three mini filets all with a different signature sauce , how can you go wrong ? Parmesan truffle fries !! Omg !! Little crispy shoestring potato delights !! Homemade potato chips ,with as my friend said , the really good bleu cheese dipping sauce !! Yum!! Everything prepared fresh and using quality ingredients ,this is a great place to start off your mid week shenanigans , as the late power hour is from 9 to close !  Rich and Mike( mark?) the bartenders are some of the friendliest in town and both make what is probably one of the best mojitos in town !! They have a great selection of power hour drinks to satisfy almost anyone's palette , as well as some great wines by the glass and of course the aforementioned mojito , definitely try them out , and if not heading out for more drinks somewhere else , try some dessert more pricey than their power hour specials , but delicious in their own right !!    As for the vibe it's a little old school Vegas , dim and dark , with candle lit tables , an upscale vibe but Definitely not stuffy !! ( although to dine in the restaurant , no tank tops , actually saw this happen where the host offered a guest a jacket to use while dining !!)"}
{"text":"I will re-visit a Morton's over a Ruth's Chris any day!

{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I love a great steak! My wife and I made reservations for date night (we are locals) and we set the reservation for an earlier time (6:30) to beat the rush. when we arrived we looked for a parking space and all of them were blocked off for valet parking. We then proceeded to the back parking and again blocked off except for 40 or so spaces which were filled by what i would say was the staff. We had to park next door in the strip mall because I do not trust the valet to drive my truck, we then had to scale a 3 foot wall to get to the front door. We  went inside and were seated promptly as there was only a few customers inside. Once I saw the amount of staff standing around watching us be seated I understood the parking situation, I counted at least 17 waiters not to mention the support staff and kitchen help. Now for the service, the waiter was prompt but understanding his accent was difficult. We ordered our meal and asked for water to drink. The waiter then placed our order and came back to us and asked if we were Mormon I explained to him we don't drink and drive and we were not Mormon just responsible. Our meal came and it was mediocre the steaks were good but not $50 plus good per steak. When all said and done the meal was almost $200.00 and the best part of the meal was the asparagus and the chocolate cake. Sorry Morton's  a steak should have a little flavor."}
{"text":"The Cajun Steak is a lot like losing your virginity, you spend more time mourning the fact it didn't last as long as you had hoped than you do the actual main course. What's to say about this place besides the fact I'm not convinced they allow farting in the bathroom. It's one of those places I'm just glad I made it out of before I broke anything, amazing food and service. Here's an extra star to place on someone else's review because clearly they're old, grumpy, and ungrateful."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with a friend and I have had excellent meals here in the past. 
Tonight was a good meal. I play the Landry game with promotion and points many generated from happy hours at Morton's and McCormick otherwise I am \"priced out\"

Six ounce filet with scallops and shrimp cooked perfectly.  Sixteen Oz NY Strip cooked perfectly..Lyonnaise potatoes excellent one problem...more onions than
Potato... Sauteed spinach with button mushrooms excellent. Desserts excellent. 

Service was very good with four different servers nearly no bumps in service. 

I think Wine markup is now in the 3x to 3.5x category. Things have changed under Landry's although I am still happy with my visits."}
{"text":"I must start by the service was absolutely amazing tonight. I have read some of the reviews here and was hesitant to make a reservation but it appears that the staff tonight has works our any kinks.  Kevin the maître d made us feel absolutely welcome. Stephanie our server really knew the menu was able to guide is through many of our choices. We had our 9 year old daughter with us and both Kevin and Stephanie went out of their way to make her feel special. They were very impressive for a place that isn't usually \"kid friendly\". 

The food was good as usual and the steaks, although I am having a hard time believing that they were USDA Prime were cooked to perfection.  We truly enjoyed the Pork Belly \"steak\" appetizer the the Wild Mushroom side dish that was recommended by Stephanie lived up to here raves!"}
{"text":"Sooo I was super excited to go to Morton's, it was the hubs and my first date since having a baby 3 months ago. We got all dolled up and off we went. We met another couple their for Restaurant Week. 

My boss had warned me that the noise level was excessive and that the steaks were average. I wish I would have listened and just went to Ruth's Chris where we know the food is always great and you can carry on a conversation with out yelling like you are in a bar at a punk rock concert. 

Even going during Restaurant Week where the 3 course meal was $40 a person our bill for 4 people came out to well over $400. We all had several drinks each, but they so kindly do not put prices next to the drinks, so you have no idea how much you are spending. 

First course I ordered the chopped salad, it was nice, it was a salad...how hard is it. 

Second course I ordered the 6 oz fillet medium well. It was nothing amazing. Just ok. 
I had that with the side of cream corn, it was gross. I also ordered a side of the onion & Bacon mac and cheese for the table...it didn't come out until we were all almost done with our meals. And I am sad I ordered it because it was not good at all. 

Third course, I ordered the Key Lime Pie, it was not edible. It tasted like Lysol. Very chemically tasting. 

So all in all, was it the worst experience I have ever had? No. Would I go back? No."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and absolutely amazing food. We will be coming back again to enjoy the steak and lobster. The deserts are just way too big! Oh my gosh! Also the coffee us amazing and the wine list is superb. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Great steaks....awesome happy hour great patrons.

Valet parking is a must, so do it if you go here.

You'll never know who famous will show up here.  It is located off the beaten path, so a nice change of pace.

Staff is top notch."}
{"text":"What a  disappointment. Went to Morton's for a nice steak dinner which you also expect comes with exquisite service. Not here. First off I ordered the Ultra Premium martini for $21.95.  Our server not the bartender made the drink. Here is how she did it - take shaker pour in vodka add two ice cubes shake and put in a warm martini glass. I asked for Olives because the menu said that they hand stuff their olives with blue cheese which I thought would be interesting. Didn't get to try them as they were just plain old regular olives. 

 My friend and I split four appetizers and he asked if any had tomatoes in them as he does not eat them. Our server said she would serve them without tomatoes. Guess what? They came with tomatoes and were an integral part of the dish which was not mentioned on the menu either. We were not served the good looking onion bread loaf like other tables.

 Of course with sharing appetizers your side plates get rather messy. No attempt by our server to remove them or the utensils from the first courses. Had to ask for that. Got water stained steak knives. Not necessarily the end of the world but not what you would expect from a high-end restaurant.

We ordered baked potato and onion rings with our steaks. I must say the onion rings were very good. Although the most outrageous and perhaps funniest part of the whole meal was when the server asked us if we would like toppings on our potato. She had 3 metal pails which we could not see what they contained nor did she tell us. After asking we said yes to sour cream, butter, and bacon bits. She did not ask how much we wanted  and proceeded to slop a large ladle of each from about about two feet away from the potato.  My friend and I  tried to dodge the flying condiments.  She dropped sour cream on the table and made no attempt to clean it up apart for moving the onion rings on top of it. When I pointed it out to her she then took the cocktail napkin from under my friends drink and swiped it up with that.

The bone in rib eye was cooked properly but is a steak house and for $63 you would kind of expect that. What a waste."}
{"text":"The best combination of ambiance and food. Wonderful steaks, on point service and clean classy setting."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Food, and Such A Great Waiter!
Jose started us off with a nice bottle of Banfi Classico! Then we had Salads that were just fresh as can be! I had the 8oz Filet Mignon cooked Perfectly! The Truffle Cauliflower Was AMAZING!  (Seasonal Dish Only) Great Atmosphere! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What sets this steakhouse apart from other steakhouses?  Nothing!  It's nice, classy, white tablecloths, obsequious waiters, good food, big cuts of meat, mac and cheese, creamed spinach, blah blah blah.  There are a million other places JUST LIKE THIS in Vegas... in fact, there's one at every hotel!  But I guess if you crave the familiarity of a chain, you might take solace in the fact that this Morton's is like all the other Morton'ses -- i.e, they show you shrink-wrapped cuts of meat and ask that you order your desert souffle before you even start the main course (mood killer!).  Nice, solid, boring.  Perfect for a business dinner... but not much fun for anything else.
What I ate and drank here: started with a cucumber Mortini and a Sazerac (can't really mess those up too badly).  Followed with chopped salad (meh...chopped salad doused in vinegar dressing; nothing more, nothing less) and onion soup (pretty good, but nothing really stood out over other onion soups). App was shrimp Alexander (good... nice big shrimp coated in delicious buttery garlic crustiness).  Entree was Cajun ribeye and crab legs (nice big juicy crab legs; steak was very tender and fatty and well-seasoned) accompanied by creamed spinch (nothing noteworthy there) and mac and cheese (good, if you're a mac fan -- crusty and white-cheesy with nice, big noodles).  Dessert was Grand Marnier souffle (meh.  WTF is the big deal with the souffles here?! It was okay, but nothing special) followed by Frangelico.
Service was attentive but kind of annoyingly peppy and boisterous.  Some like it that way, I suppose...but to me, it was like being served steak by the Southwest Airlines flight crew.  Whee!
All in all, being as there are SOOOO many other steakhouse options in Vegas, I would say that if you're looking to have a good steak dinner, it's the ambience that makes the difference.  And I can name several places in town at comparable prices with a more interesting ambience!"}
{"text":"Came here last night and saw all the great reviews so had pretty high expectations. It wasn't a full house for a Sunday night however the food took a bit longer than I had expected (almost an hour). The server recommended the shrimp Alexander which was so-so to me (I'm not a fan of deep fried/crispy food) but my hubs enjoyed it. Steak was okay. I ordered the Manhattan steak with bone in and hubs ordered Chicago style steak. We both thought it was okay. IMO the KEG is comparable in terms of steak but service/ambiance/location Morton's would win. Finally, we had the molten chocolate lava cake, it wasn't too sweet so I enjoyed it. However, if I really need to be picky about it (since its one of my fave dessert) the chocolate inside was not gooey at all and did not gush out. Would I come back again? Maybe."}
{"text":"Its a mint to eat here my wife and I used to each here before BC (before children) and its pretty damn wonderful. The wait staff it there for you to wait on YOU. They are excellent, they want you to be happy they want you to have an excellent menu, they want their tip. 

It is the old school-old world eats the steak is so tender you can slice it with a fork the lobster my wife had was massive and excellent. And they will shell it for you, you know how hard it is to get at the meat of these things. 

The wine is excellent and its a wonderful place to visit if you can take out a low interest loan. 

Our bill out the door with tip was $310.00 for two people but that was years ago and I know it has not gotten cheaper."}
{"text":"When I travel for work, Morton's tends to be my staple steak place.  I've always been a big fan of the steaks, the shrimp Alexander, the lava cake, and the happy hour.  I have to say this last experience wasn't too good.  In order:

It started off with our ordering of cocktails and a 20 minute wait to receive them.  

Twenty to twenty five minutes passed between ordering and our salads arriving.

Another long wait for steaks, one of which was very undercooked.  That was sent back and came back charred.  No replacement was offered.

Espresso was ordered with dessert.  It arrived immediately but the dessert would be another 15 minutes.  As would the sugar I asked for with the espresso so that had to be remade as well.  

Finally, the bill was wrong.  We were overcharged for our dinners and didn't notice until we were signing our credit card receipts.  Guess what took another 10+ minutes to correct?

$519 + tip and 2.5 hours.  The food is good but there are just too many good restaurants in Scottsdale for this kind of stuff.  I cannot see myself returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town from California visiting Pittsburgh for the Steelers game.  We were craving a steak and having had a phenomenal experience in Los Angeles at another Morton's Steakhouse, we decided to give this one a try.  
When we got there, the restaurant was packed and only room in the bar area.  We took it.  Our waitress was very nice, attentive and explained all the specials.  We went with the appetizer tacos (AWESOME!!), and shared a ribeye (we always do) and a baked potato.  We ordered the steak medium well.  Well, it came almost well done, but we were so hungry we ate it.  Needless to say, it was very dry and not much flavor. For the price we paid for the steak, we could have just had two beers and two orders of the tacos and we would have been good to go. 
So, for a Morton's Steakhouse, we expected more.  We were eye balling other steak venues in town too, but this one was the closest to our hotel."}
{"text":"Master of the filet, but less so regarding those delicacies from the sea. Environment is the standard dark wood and lower intensity lights, nice after a day of meetings and work. Service from being greeted at the door to the wait staff and host/ess stand all friendly, efficient and excellent. My mixed grill of the filet, shrimp and bacon enclosed scallops was brought out promptly after finishing the delicious escargot with puffed patty bread coverings. While the filet and scallops were succulent, regretfully the shrimp was overdone and as a result a bit rubbery as a result. Finishing the meal of with a Taylor port made up for it though. Consistent with other Morton's it's a place I'd return."}
{"text":"We've been going to Morton's for about 13 years now.  In addition to this Scottsdale location, we also patronize their San Diego (downtown) location as well.  Never had a bad experience in all these years.  We even had our wedding reception here.  Steaks are always perfect.  Sides, desserts, and drinks never disappoint!  5 stars given for long history of flawless product and service!"}
{"text":"Nice happy hour items, and above average bar service. The filet trio for eight dollars and the Finlandia vodka for happy hour is top-notch"}
{"text":"We WERE excited to go to this restaurant because we had heard it was one of the best steakhouses in Cleveland....how disappointing.The WORST food I recall having from ANY restaurant... aside from the Denny's on Brookpark I went to one late night.  Not 1 of 3 of us finished our meal or \"doggy bagged\" it and when a meal comes in at $280 one of those should occur.  

The Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes tasted like they came from a box. Bland. The horseradish potatoes tasted like they dumped the whole jar of horseradish in....We had bacon & onion macaroni and cheese, it was dry, not cheesy and the noodles tasted reheated. Pretty much everything other than the appetizers were below par. 

Not everything was horrible though....The sea scallops and Ahi Tuna were both very good. Food presentation was lovely. The atmosphere was nice. The staff, superb. Our waitress, Jillian - was adorable and the perfect waitress, she should work at a better restaurant. 

Maybe we came in on an \"off night\" but for those prices, that should NEVER happen. We will not be back to find out. The prices are insane for the quality of food. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm not a big steak fan but my hubby is and he decided to take us here on date night. The service alone is beyond belief. From the moment we walked In until we walked out we were treated like royalty. You couldn't take more than 5 sips of your water before someone appeared out of no where with a re fill lol. I ordered chicken breast and the Mac n cheese. It was wonderful, hot and tender. My hubby ordered a steak and he loved it. He was talking about that steak all night lol we've told everyone about our experience here. It's definitely worth the money. I wish all places in Vegas had this type of experience. We definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Came in last Friday evening and had almost the exact same experience, so you really can't tell me it was a one-off.

We were seated just shortly after 9p.  Got our waters and menu within minutes.  Put in our orders before 9:11.  Drinks came before 9:23p.  Not too bad, three glasses of wine.  The food plates came out at that time, too, including the cute gravy boat full of ketchup.  We were told the food would be right up.  So we didn't hold back on the drinking.  That was a mistake.  Food didn't arrive until 9:54.  Yes, I checked on that exact timing.  We couldn't get ahold of anyone to bring the check for nearly an hour.  It was 10:56 before our credit cards were brought back to us.  One person did apologize, when the bill was brought over, saying, \"Sorry about the wait, the bar got a little behind.\"  

TLDR: 1 hour wait for food, 1 hour wait for check.  Food is fine, although it bugs me to pay $8 for a small  (under 6oz) glass of wine when the bottle sells for the same price."}
{"text":"I'm not really a huge fan of chain restaurant steakhouses but I must say I was thoroughly impressed with Morton's. My friends and I chose to dine during restaurant week and typically during that week service and quality tend to slack. This was quite the opposite with Morton's. We were always taken care of and I wish I had our servers name because he was absolutely amazing and the food was absolutely delicious. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and everything came out on time. I was really pleased with my experience and I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately overpriced for the quality of the food. I feel like you could have the same items at another restaurant that is less stuffy and old-school than this place."}
{"text":"Great place, the prices have fall quite a bit on the steaks and some dishes!! Loved the food and great desert"}
{"text":"First of all they had HUGE portions, if you are an averaged size human you should share your meal.  The Seafood appetizer was fresh and I could've have eaten more if I wasn't saving room for my super sized steak.  The bread was fluffy and freshly baked.  I ordered the Chicago Cut Ribeye, which was seasoned perfectly, but a bit over cooked.  We were celebrating my  husbands birthday and they sprinkled confetti on the table and made us personalized menus and gave us a picture with a signed cards.  I may go back again, but I think it was too pricey for the quality of food.  $400 for a party of 3."}
{"text":"Decided to have a nice dinner away from the strip. Service was great. I wish I remembered our server but he was the guy that moved to LV from Texas not long ago. I even forgot my $100 sunglasses and called 25mins later. The Mgr that found my glasses was nice enough to leave it at valet for my to pick up when I was ready. We ordered oysters, Chicago prime rib and reg prime rib. Both were cooked perfectly. Will be back again on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I have no words, I can't say anything it is that great I am in love with the steak I wanna come here everyday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My review is a bit overdue as we dined here for Restaurant Week in June. Overall, this is a good option for a quality steakhouse meal and experience.

The location is off Strip and has plenty of parking in the back of the building. Morton's also offers valet, but being off Strip it doesn't really seem necessary to valet. 

The inside of the restaurant was a bit old school. The restaurant is on the dark side and not overly large. There are rooms for large groups off of the main dining area, but the main dining area is essentially one large room. They offer a combination of tables and booths.

The onion bread to start was tasty. The Morton's salad was okay and did the trick for a serving of vegetables. It was not the most exciting salad though. My filet was delicious, tender and buttery. It was prepared as I requested. I loved my sides, mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Dessert was a chocolate mousse, it was creamy and full of chocolate flavor."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but what is the big deal?!? I can get great steak for a lot less $$. And everything is ala carte! No way. I was not impressed by anything here. Ruth's Chris is better! But quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe our experience here. I've been to plenty of Morton's Anaheim, Beverly Hills, Santa Ana, downtown LA I've even tried the New York location but this is by far the BEST location I've been to. 

Service: where do I start, when paying a nice amount of money you expect a great level of service. From the host to the bartenders while waiting to get seating to our waiter and the manager there is great management here and you can tell by the way the employees work. EVERYONE including the manager were on top of all their guest. There was someone constantly refilling our drinks without asking which made this experience even better. Something so simple yet not a lot of restaurants master it. Our waiter was pleasant and polite. The manager was very professional and the whole staff was managed very well.

Food: this last Thursday we went to Mastros it wast first time and coming here tonight made me realize why I'm so loyal to Morton's! We ordered a filet mignon with the Alexander jumbo shrimp, for the sides we ordered the masked potatoes and the macaroni and cheese. We started our meal with some amazing bread and moved on to the chopped spinach salad and last but not least... The chocolate lava cake.... To DIE for!

Kudos to this amazing restaurant! Amazing chefs and employees!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary , I had the Lobster and he had a steak. It was perfectly prepared and delicious. We loved it here. It was perfect for a celebration."}
{"text":"Bought by corporate Landry's (and the Camelback location closed) this former steak giant is headed south, and fast.

What do you think about when you think, \"Morton's\"?
--strangely tan vinyl booths (yes, I've seen them in Chicago, and I finally get it)
--sinatra standards
--bow ties
--to be shown what a beefsteak tomato looks like (from the cart)
--to be shown what a life lobster looks like (the poor kiddo)
--to be shown what a porterhouse looks like (oh, YUM)
--crabcakes
--AND THE BEST DARNed steak you can get in town, _no matter the cut_
--don't forget the sprigs of watercress, my favorite.

But Landry's isn't having it. A multi-million dollar brand is taking a new direction:
#no more Sinatra
#no more cart
#maitre'd has no tux
#limited Champagne options; $160 Tatt is a plain ripoff.

Steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen these days and with Eddie V's nearby putting on the Ritz with live jazz and magnums of the Heitz Martha's Vineyard _besides great steaks_, Landry's Morton's won't be here for long."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST!!  I am in serious doubt of the low ratings that I saw prior to going tonight for my wife's birthday dinner.  Top quality all the way around, she got the 6 ounce filet, and I went with the 16 ounce cajun ribeye, both steaks were cooked perfectly and the tenderness and flavor for both steaks was fantastic.  We also got the mashed potatoes and creamed corn for sides, I must say that the creamed corn was OUTSTANDING.
Service was excellent, an all-around great experience"}
{"text":"I can't tell the difference between Morton's and other chain high-end steakhouse."}
{"text":"24oz Porterhouse cooked all so perfect with every slice and making you want more right  after? That's a very good sign of a steak done right and that's saying a lot for me. Retro ambience with the lighting of the flames cooking the steaks in the background make you want your steak like it was yesterday. Hands down one of the best steaks I've enjoyed. Crab cakes and dessert and coffee are just icing on the cake as a good restaurant should be."}
{"text":"Great experience! The restaurant is very clean, modern, and the ambiance is very romantic. Our waiter, Christian, was very attentive. He explained the menu and gave us very helpful recommendations. The food was delicious! We got steaks and potato. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The dessert was mouthwatering. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I came to Morton's on a Saturday night because I had been craving Chocolate Lava Cake and Morton's was the only place in Pittsburgh that had it on the menu.

My boyfriend and I were seated immediately in the near-empty restaurant. He ordered the Cadillac Margarita ($15) which was VERY strong and I ordered the Summer Sangria ($15). I didn't like the Summer Sangria too much because it tasted like a glass of white wine with ice, a few raspberries and a strawberry. I couldn't even finish the half of a glass that they served me. I prefer my Sangrias with red wine and a more fruity taste.

We shared Morton's Chocolate Lava Cake ($15). The cake came out less than warm but nevertheless the chocolate lava spilled out of the cake with the first spoonful. It was pretty good but not the best. $50 for 2 drinks and a dessert was expensive for a late night treat but typical price range for Morton's. If you're only looking for a late night treat, I would suggest exploring other dining options in the area."}
{"text":"Pro's: 
Friendly, accommodating staff (our waitress and bartender were both top notch)
Nice ambiance
Great cocktails and substantial wine selection 

Con's:
Small appetizer portions ($20+ for 4 or 5 chunks of lump crab)
Ordered a medium rare steak, received a well done steak (the manager quickly corrected the error)
Undercooked/Raw Fish (again the manager quickly corrected the error)
Entrees were over-salted

Overall, we were disappointed with our dinner. The steak was overcooked and the fish was undercooked. For the price we pay at Morton's we expect exceptionally high quality but we left feeling like we just paid $300 for a meal at Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Morton's over the years and I've had consistently good food and service.  I had the bone-in ribeye and my wife had the sea bass tonight.  Both were excellent and cooked perfectly. Our server Victoria was very good and was attentive without being overbearing.  My only issue is that I shouldn't expect to see people in jeans and sweatshirts in a restaurant where I'm dropping $200+ for dinner for two. If Morton's wants to be viewed as a premium restaurant, they need to enforce a dress code."}
{"text":"For my boyfriend's birthday earlier this week, he told me that he wanted steak for dinner.  Steak he wants, steak he gets!  We did a little bit of research about where to get a great piece of meat in Pittsburgh, and we finally decided to check out Morton's.  We'd heard of it from Chicago, and it definitely has a good reputation there too.

So we came in for our 7:30 reservation on a Tuesday.  The hostess greeted us warmly, and led us into the dimly lit room to our booth.  I had told them on OpenTable that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and my mom called ahead to pre-order some things, so the waitstaff knew that we were celebrating.  And wow, somebody told him \"Happy birthday!\" every 15 minutes!  They all knew about it!  Our menus actually had \"Happy 28th birthday, Taylor!\" printed on them.  My mom had pre-ordered sparkling wine, which was waiting for us on ice when we arrived.  The sommelier (wearing a tux!) poured it for us.  After we toasted, a hostess came by with a digital camera and snapped our picture.  Five minutes later, she came back with a print out of the picture, and a birthday card signed by various servers.  Wowza!

We felt unbelievably welcomed.  We helped ourselves to a slice of the huge loaf of onion-y bread sitting on the table, while we listened to our server tell us about the various menu offerings.  It's a little funny how they have examples of the food sitting under plastic wrap.  It does give you a nice visual for the steaks, but it's a little funny for....asparagus.  Still, seeing the size of the meat helped us make our choice.

First, we got the onion soup and the Caesar salad.  The onion soup was served bubbling hot, with a layer of cheese baked on top, of course.  It was very tasty - not the best I've ever had, but it definitely hit the spot for two hungry people!  Something about the broth was a bit too sweet perhaps.  The Caesar was great - they knew we were splitting it so they served it on two perfectly portioned plates - you could taste every single ingredient that goes in a classic Caesar.  You know they made this dressing perfectly - can't leave out the anchovy!  Delicious.

We each got the bone-in Ribeye, which was 20 oz of medium-rare amazingness.  Our steaks were unbelievably tender and flavorful.  The meat was pretty marbled, but the fat was so succulent that honestly I ate every bite of it.  The meat needs no sauce - just that luscious char on top and warm tender beef within.  Fantastic.  Loved every bite.  Our one wish was that the plates were warmed - since they were cool, it seemed like the steak was cooling down faster than it should.  But that didn't stop us from loving our wonderful dinner!

Mom had pre-ordered two desserts, their classic chocolate cake and the creme brulee.  I didn't taste the cake, but my boyfriend said it was incredibly rich and decadent.  I loved the creme brulee, and somehow finished every bite despite being stuffed already.

Service was always friendly, the ambiance was romantic, and truly I felt like we were royalty.  Come here on a special occasion, and you'll see what I mean.  It is a very expensive place to eat, but totally worth it for a special occasion.  With prices that high, you deserve to feel like their most cherished patrons of all time, and we certainly did.  I would very much like to come back the next time we have something to celebrate and want to have a big steak at the same time!"}
{"text":"We usually visit once during our trip to see my in-laws in Vegas. We go during happy hour and order mini cheeseburgers, mini crab cake blt's and blue cheese steak fries.  Always excellent food and service. Jennifer is excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic Dinner from the moment we walked in. 

The bar staff was excellent and our waiter Jose never made us wait a second for anything. 

Our Filet's were cooked perfectly and the rest of dinner was absolutely top notch. 

Only slight downside which we knew going in was that their wines were severely overpriced compared to other restaurants. 

As an example a $12 Cab which we had the night before at PF Chang's for $26 was over $50. Not to mention their least expensive bottles were $45 and these equated to $6-8 bottles of wine."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. So I'll first qualify by saying I'm not a big steak guy so this may discredit my opinion in your eyes, but Morton's is just an ok steakhouse (especially comparing it to Jacob's or Hy's). We got:
- French onion soup: Best part of the meal for me. Not as good as Barbarian's (which has the best onion soup in the city), but this was great - lots of gooey cheese, just the right amount of bread, and the soup wasn't overly salty.
- Mac and cheese: Looked really good until we dug in and it tasted a bit bland.
- Filet mignon with shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops: The steak was cooked to the right temperature and had good flavour, but the shrimps and scallops basted basically like butter and were a bit rubbery.
- Jumbo shrimp: Lacked any distinct flavour.
- Morton's legendary hot chocolate cake: I know I may be the minority here, but it was far from legendary. Tasted like many other chocolate lava cakes I've had.

I guess what also made my Morton's experience less than expected was the dining area itself: super crammed (to the point that servers were having a difficult time navigating through guests as they stood from their tables; we even witnessed a patron crashing into a server), really noisy, and there was a bar area which weirdly almost seemed like a sports bar with all its tvs. So it was really not the vibe I was expecting from this place.

I may have been expecting too much, but for the prices Morton's charges, I was hoping for a more fine dining experience. From both the food and venue experience, it failed to meet these expectations."}
{"text":"While the restaurant has nice atmosphere and good service, for the prices paid, I expected better for the food. The starter salad ($12.50!) tasted like it had been pre-made and refrigerated for days - cold and soggy, definitely not fresh, and definitely not worth $12.50. My dad ordered the 8oz. filet and it was low quality and dry - not the \"melt in your mouth\" taste you'd expect for paying $50 for a filet. The horseradish mashed potatoes ($13) were also dry - we had to add butter to them.  The sea bass I had was good, but overpriced at a whopping $48. I've had comparable sea bass at other restaurants for much less. Finally, the cocktails - I understand paying over $12 for a craft cocktail, but the fact we were charged $12.50 for Jameson on the rocks is ridiculous. Unfortunately, with the high prices and mediocre food, I don't think we'll be back."}

We sincerely apologize for this error and any confusion this email may have caused."}
{"text":"Morton's is the quintessential steak house. While others feel it is a place for the \"good old boys\", it is none the less, one of the absolute prize steakhouses of the world. Morton's is a chain, and can be found in many countries of the world. I have eaten in many of them ranging from Hong Kong to New York and the food is consistent wherever you choose to go.

Drinks at Morton's are nothing to sneeze at. They are always made with premium brands and are more than adequate for most people. (Their chocolate Godiva martini is to die for!)

A word of warning - all food at Morton's is a la carte, and portions are big. Should you order a tomato as a salad expect to see one of the largest and most succulent tomatoes on your plate, perfectly presented. Morton's has a large assortment of entrees ranging from lobster bisque to shrimp cocktail (not sure if those are shrimp or small lobsters) to tuna tartar, crab cakes and perfect oysters on the half shell. Always remember that portions are huge and you still have the main course coming!

Speaking of main courses - in a word - unbelievable.

The portions, once again, are huge, and their meats are all true prime. Your waitperson will wheel a cart of the meats to your table so that you can make your selection. Watch out for that 3 pound lobster - It's alive on the cart and just could nip your finger if you get it too close!

For a real treat try the porterhouse or the Chicago bone in rib eye. Truly amazing to eat. The prime rib (Friday and Saturday only) are wonderful but if you want it you will need to come early - it's a limited cut of beef at the restaurant - when they run out that's it for the night.

For lighter fare they also have assorted fish and chicken dishes as well as spectacular lamb chops.

For sides, try the creamed spinach, the Lyonnaise potatoes, or share a small football sized baked potato.

Desserts are legendary at Morton's. Some like the chocolate souffle must be ordered at the beginning of the meal, but oh are they worth it. The desserts are made with the same care as the entire rest of the meal and are just as fattening! For a change of pace, try their fresh berries - you won't be disappointed and it will help with your waistline. Do plan on bringing a doggie bag (perhaps several doggie bags) home with you.

Sanitation is impeccable, and the bathrooms are gorgeous. This is a terrific special occasion place. Valet parking out front.

I rate this a 5 star restaurant. (Expensive but worth every penny)"}
{"text":"Service was awful.  My friend had a birthday get together,  we met in the bar,  about 20 of us showed up but there was no one else in the entire restaurant.  The bartenders had no desire to serve \"us\".  With attitudes and reluctance they assisted.  When I asked about a menu item, I was looked at like he saw a ghost.  After being treated with blatant disrespect and asking for the manager,  my table was thrown the check,  literally.  The manager did come and try to make things right by taking off part of the bill but I would rather pay full price and receive service as any human being should.  Shame on you mortons for such horrible service."}
{"text":"I like to splurge, but this place is ridiculous. Very limited menu, and sky high prices. Service was only OK. I ordered steak Diane, which was very good, but the mushrooms were tough as nails. Asked for tomato on my Caesar Salad, but the salad never came. Shrimp cocktail was fabulous, but at $24? House wine was OK, but $17 for a glass of house wine?  Total bill with tip for one shrimp cocktail, 6 ounce filet, and one glass of house wine... $117. Too much for my blood."}
{"text":"I've heard of Morton's extremely good service, and it was definitely up to par with what people have told me.

 The hostess who picked up when we called gave us horrible directions coming from The Mirage, which took us over an hour (in Las Vegas traffic) to get there, and we were rushed for dinner because we had a show to catch very soon after. Upon arrival, the employee (quite possibly a manager) who was at the front greeted us and asked how we were doing, to which my sister's boyfriend responded \"not good at all\" given that we were lost for an hour (even worse for my sister, who was the one driving!)

He apologized, and we thought that was the end of that. But they ended up giving us free drinks for the whole table (about a $50 value). Not only that, the food was amazing (we had the steak and seafood special), and came out quickly which helped us catch our show. Our waiter was great, and my menu was personalized (because it was my birthday) and framed a picture they took of us and it said Happy Birthday so that really made my night.

Overall, it was a good experience, and I'm definitely down to go back to any other Morton's."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable but service was lousy.   We've always loved Mortons for both great food and amazing service.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time ever last night and the overall experience was incredible!! Showed up 30 mins early from our reservations and was seated immediately. It being my first time there, the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and any questions we had, he also stayed on top of the drinks. The steak was cooked to perfection, nice and juicy, tender, and well seasoned. It was the best steak my date and I ever had (Cajun ribeye, my date had the NY strip) and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The best steak and service as always when we come here. The staff and manager top notch. 
 No issues at all the porterhouse the best my wife has had and my Cajun ribeye the best. Cannot beat this place. Always come here for anniversary  and birthdays if possible. Thank you staff"}
{"text":"I've been to this Morton's dozens of times over the past 20 years, but it's been a while since we've last visited, so we decided to give it a try and celebrate a birthday there this past weekend. 
Overall, the food was good, and the service was attentive.  The steaks were prepared well, and tasty, as were the other dishes we ordered.  Although my filet mignon was only lukewarm when it arrived.
But, here's my \"beef\" with Mortons:  it's TOO EXPENSIVE for standard steakhouse fare anymore.  For 3 people, we had 4 cocktails, 2 appetizers, a bottle of CA wine, 3 steak entrees, 2 side dishes that we shared, and it cost OVER $400, including tax and tip.  
We could go to ANY restaurant in Cleveland for that amount of money, and get a far more memorable, unique, and classy experience.  Plus, if it's a special occasion restaurant, then Morton's needs to institute a dress policy if they want to enhance diners' experiences.  We sat next to people in flip flops, baseball caps, and cutoffs, which hardly enhanced our special occasion."}
{"text":"Come in for late night \"power hour\" and try the filet bites for $8 (three bites, three sauces, amazing!) at the bar. If Rich is working, you are guaranteed to have an amazing experience as he is not only knowledgeable and friendly, but an overall awesome bartender. All the class and sophistication you expect from Morton's, he brings to the table with an acute attention to detail and unpretentious charm. Top to bottom? An awesome experience every time!"}
{"text":"I attend a lunch seminar here so my review is not based on a personal dinner or lunch experience. The steak was excellent and prepared perfect. Very upscale and great seafood items on the menu if you are not a meat lover."}
{"text":"Food & good service still on-point!!! The bartenders are great & know how to make you a well made drink!!! Excellent Happy Hour and fabulous desserts!!! Thank you Thomas-Assistant Manager at Morton's Steakhouse, for your wonderful hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"Reservation was at 7:00. We ordered at 8:00. It's 9:30 and we are still waiting for our steaks. The appetizers took less than five minutes. The manager has been bye twice to tell us \"3 minutes\" But where are our steaks?  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation and took my Mom here for her birthday. The host called me the day of to confirm my reservation and asked for the name of the person celebrating their birthday. 

Exceptional Items:
-When we arrived they sat us and gave us menus with my Mom's name, and \"Happy Birthday\", along with the date. It was a simple but very nice touch that she loved and made her feel special.
-They took our picture, printed it, and put it in a birthday card they made card for her to take
-I ordered the Cajun Steak; it was one of the best steaks I've had at a steak house! Perfectly seasoned and at the perfect temperature. My mom had the porterhouse steak and loved her steak as well. 
- Very extensive wine list! 
-The service we received from our server was great. She was very nice and knowledge of the menu

Average Items:
-The brussel sprouts were ok, nothing special
-The lobster mac was ok, the lobster was chewy
Creme Brulee for dessert was good, but it's hard to make creme brulee anything more than what it is.
-Crab cakes ok, served with a sauce that tasted like flavored mayo
-Lobster bisque, ok

I would definitely recommend eating here and will be back."}
{"text":"I think this was the first time I actually ate a dinner at Morton's. I made a reservation and noted that it was for a birthday. We got there and they had menus specially printed that said Happy Birthday on the top :)

It was pretty good, I love me some good food! Ordered lobster bisque and I thought it was super tasty. My boyfriend wasn't a big fan of it, but I love a good, rich lobster bisque so I finished my bowl and had some of his too...did I mention I love lobster bisque? For entrees, I ordered the braised beef short rib w/ jumbo sea scallops. Both delicious, I love scallops and there were 3 large ones on the plate. Beef was really tender and flavorful. Also came with a large portion of horseradish mashed potatoes. Super horse-radishy but I love horseradish so I thought they were delectable. Boyfriend got the Chicago Ribeye I think and that was pretty good. It was really tender and cooked perfectly.

To end the dinner, they brought out a souffle with whipped cream in a gravy boat and stuck a candle in it! It was really good, super fluffy and a hint of lemon. Didn't look at the check very hard before sticking my credit card in there but I'm pretty sure it was free since it was his birthday so that was fantastic :)"}
{"text":"Took some family a friends for a nice night out and Morton's exceeded expectations. From the friendly greeting as we walked in, to the superb service and delicious food, we had a fantastic night. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal and experience to go with it."}
{"text":"Amazing steaks! A friend of mine came into town and recommended this place and it didnt disappoint.  Asked our server to recommend for us and he asked a couple questions and made his recommendation. It was amazing. Great service and amazing food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I would absolutely recommend Morton's - even during Charlotte Restaurant Week / Queen's Feast!

I went here during restaurant week for my boyfriend's birthday - the service was simply outstanding!!

Despite it being busy due to restaurant week, our reservation was honored and table was ready promptly. The service staff really made the evening special by letting us take our time in between courses, turning our dessert course into a birthday dessert, and taking and printing a photo of the two of us at dinner to remember the meal.

The food, of course, was great. The prices and menu offering during restaurant week is a steal! Make sure to make your reservation early because I'm sure the spots fill up quickly here."}
{"text":"Tonight my fiancee and I ate here for the first time and it definitely wont be the last. Everything about this place exceeded our expectations. It was absolutely amazing! The food, the drinks, and the service!!! It was not cheap by any means but it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we go to Morton's all over the country but never have I seen anything like this! Upon entering in a wheel chair only one door was held open by the valet attendant, leaving the second door non accessible until another guest opened it! Both walking in and out only one door was opened, making it impossible to get in or out if disabled. The service was mediocre at best! Our orders were all messed up and we got our coffee at least 10 minutes after dessert was served. We all commented it must've been our server's first day as she was extremely disorganized and frantic. Not what you expect at s Morton's. Then to top it off, when we left the hostess and a manager stood at the desk, watching my father (in a wheel chair) wait at the door for someone to open it. They were too busy laughing at him to open it! I stood there, as my heart raced, listening to these arrogant SOB's. The next day I called the manager and instead of listening to me, he defended his employees saying I was lying. 
There's a lot of great restaurants in Vegas, Please DO NOT patronize one where discrimination is defended!!!"}
{"text":"This was me And my husband first time at Morton's and the service is GREAT. I have been to all the steak houses and this is our favorite! We went to the happy hour. The stuff was soooooo nice the drinks was GREAT I had the Morton's martini and a Cosmopolitan. And my husband had the Golden Pineapple which was soooo yummy! For dinner he had the rack of Lamb and mashed potatoes which was GREAT! And I had Chicken Christopher wedge salad and cheese potatoes! Everything was more then excellent! This is our new favorite place. Thank you so much Morton's we will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Morton's in my lifetime, but this was my first time to the Las Vegas Morton's. 
my husband and i went for power hour (their rendition of happy hour); it was great!
the mojitos were out of this world, great bartender, do believe her name was Conji.
We also ordered the best appetizer in the world. Ahi tuna tower. I'm not one for raw fish, but nothing beats this little beauty. it's so full of flavor, and color, and texture. it's beyond delicious.
then i noticed the table next to us ordered the filet mignon trio, so I had to keep up with them!
so I ordered it. 
best decision I've ever made. each mini filet (and I do mean MINI) was topped with an array of yummy sauces. the bleu cheese was my favorite. I had a steakgasm. 

While you're there sign up for their VIP card, sure it's $25, but you get it back in a gift certificate. and you can start racking up the points to continue earning those $25 rewards."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a really nice restaurant with amazing quality food, this is the place to go. it's pricey, but more than worth it. my boyfriend took me over the weekend and we dressed up real nice and went and I did not feel overdressed at all. the lighting is dim which makes it a cozy environment in my opinion. it felt really high class. the staff was really nice, the valet guy held the door open for us when we came in and back out. our waitress was nice and I noticed that all the waiters and waitresses tell you all about the meat they serve and give you really good info which was nice. we both got filet mignon and we both agreed that it was by far the best we've ever had. it was \"melt-in-your-mouth\" steak. it doesn't come with sauce- but trust me. it doesn't need it. we also got sour cream mashed potatoes to share and they were absolutely delicious. they were smooth and creamy and had the right amount of flavor. you have to order your dessert in advance because they bake it fresh. we got the molten chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream and it came to us hot and fresh and it was to die for. if you have the money and you want to treat yourself and whoever else, please go for it. this place was the nicest I've ever been to."}
{"text":"We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey."}
{"text":"I've honestly never been there for dinner, but many visits for HAPPY HOUR! They do this quite well! I love to order a few drinks with some of their bar bites. The filet mignon trio and the tuna tacos are my absolute favorites!"}
{"text":"Great food! Extremely romantic Atmosphere and great service. Be prepared 'his is really pricey but if you are looking for a romantic place as a couple this is a great place."}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday and her family reserved one of the private dining rooms for dinner since this was one of their favorite restaurants. The room was elegant and spacious and featured one long dining table. At the end of the room was a display table which was perfect for the two-tiered birthday cake.

The menu was pre-arranged with specific main course items to choose and side dishes for the group to share. I chose the Double Cut Filet Mignon, medium rare. The steak was huge! A tad overdone, but it was easy to overlook based on the flavor and tenderness. The sides: Steamed Jumbo Asparagus, Lyonnaise Potatoes, Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes, Bacon and Onion Macaroni & Cheese, and Bernaise Sauce. All done really well and importantly, delicious! Everything about the meal was decadent. It was difficult to finish the steak (the double cut isn't messing around), let alone eat more than just a spoonful of each of the sides.

Service was phenomenal and the dinner ran smoothly. I can imagine that if they can organize and successfully execute a 20-person party, a regular dinner for two would be a breeze. It's been a while since my visit, but this is definitely one of the better steakhouses in the city."}
{"text":"Definitely the best place to grab a steak so far. It's located conveniently close by to my work so I figured I'd give this place a shot. 

Decor of the steak house was classy. Servers were extremely nice. Asked the servers for suggestions for a first timer. Recommended the 12oz, along with the creamy spinach and Mac and cheese. 

Steak was cooked raw which is what I requested for, no more no less. Knife cut through the steak like butter without all the blood dripping out. Tasted spectacular. Creamy spinach was amazing. Mac and cheese was on point. Finished with the carrot cake which was an extremely generous serving size and more than I could indulge in. Definitely the best steakhouse of all time."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday and it was the one and only time that I had ever been here
 Do you not eat red meat but luckily I was able to order a fish. That was on the menu my husband definitely enjoyed it. 
We had to listen to a horror story of the electricity going out when there was a huge flood
This location is what's wrong with the restaurant only because there is a sewer problem in that area that affects all of the restaurants once a month. 
We did definitely get good service when we were there. And I can't complain about the meal that I had but it's not a place I would go back to"}
{"text":"At five star prices (about $100 a person), I would expect a five star meal. When I can get a better steak at places like Texas Roadhouse something has really gone wrong.  Out of four meals ordered at our table two had to go back. One, a filet, was better the second time around, but just better and not amazing. The other, a ribeye, was replaced because the first was over half fat.  The replacement tasted like a sirloin and was also sent back.  At over $50 the meat should be marbeled, tender and flavorful. It was crusty, nearly burnt on the outside and just tasteless.  Such a disappointment.

Our server was excellent and apologetic about the food so that's why they get a couple stars. The manager stopped by to apologize for the steaks the first time, but not the second. At a steakhouse of this caliber, you shouldn't ever have to apologize for your meat.

The table next to us also complained about their meals, so perhaps the restaurant was just having a bad night?

For what it's worth, I rarely send anything back. I actually feel bad doing so, but I just couldn't choke down a cut of fat this bad.

My wife and I are Landry's Select VIP members (parent company of Morton's), so we have eaten at quite a few nice restaurants all over the country.  With that said it is highly unlikely that we will visit this one again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I was very impressed with the food, service, and ambience.  The oysters, Caesar salad, and bread were delicious to start. I ordered the filet, bacon wrapped scallops and shrimps and my boyfriend ordered the bone in Chicago style rib eye. Both were the best steaks I've ever had! The potatoes au gratin were delicious. I was impressed with the wine selection and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mortons Steakhouse, a classic staple in Yorkville. I've always enjoyed this restaurant...great service...delicious steaks and pricey menu. When you come to Mortons you know you're not
Going to walk out with a cheap bill, however it's well worth the money. Tonight with a group of 15 people we dined upstairs in the private room...I got the chance to try a variety of items. Started with their famous Tuna TarTar tower... Explosive flavored by beware a bit spicy. Also ordered the shrimp cocktails... Yes it only comes with 4/5 shrimps but man they are H U G E! The best shrimp in the world. Next the bread the brought to the table was fresh, hot and delish. Honest.. I could've made a meal out of the bread. Alright now listen if you're ever going to share a steak with someone order the porter house... You will not regret it. It was melt in your mouth better than Jacob & Co. Also had the crab cakes-- wouldn't order them again ...they were fishy. Tried the braised beef.. Very delish. ANYWAYS if you have room in your tummy for dessert you have to get the classic chocolate lava cake. Mortons is for special occasions... Book a table."}
{"text":"This is my new hot spot for happy hour.
I usually go there for the bar 9pm happy hours. 
They have some good happy hour menu like 7 dollars Filet Mignon Trio,Three Prime Cheeseburgers and Tuna Tacos.. Those are my favorite dishes.
It is great place to chill,chit chat, enjoy food and drinks at the same time.
I made their membership card with 25 dollars but once you get the card.. you get 25 dollars credit so nothing to lose.
I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Disappointed. It was dead the Saturday before Valentine's Day and we see why. Honestly management to chef to service fail. Would not recommend. The pumpkin spice Moscow mule was delicious, but took a while to get and there was no one around :/ so many great steakhouse options in vegas, sadly, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"My parents used to go here all the time since they had a wine locker, I've been here and had an amazing customer service experience. The Filet I had was extremely tender and juicy and of course the best since Mortons is known for outstanding quality. It was a night to remember."}
{"text":"Yes, Morty's is a chain. Yes, I still love it dearly. Yes, I wish it were less expensive. It also reminds me of my time in the Windy City...so I'm probably a bit biased.

They do, however, have a great bar menu with $5-$6 bar bites all day, every day except Saturday. Those are indeed quite the deal!

What I love from Morton's:

The staff: The servers, hosts and bartenders are extremely well-educated around their menu and offerings. Plus they are really in tune to ensure you have a great experience.

The environment: Old school steak house. Dark, oiled wood. Not super duper loud. Modern speakeasy, so to speak! 

Filet mignon: Durr. Delicious. Perfectly cooked. Always.

Any type of potato: Really, any kind. I have yet to find a tater that I don't love here.

Morton's coffee: A delicious, alcoholic concoction that is just damn delightful. It's $8 but they also put real whipped cream on top...it's like a lovely dessert in a cup.

Lava cake: The best chocolate lava cake in Charlotte. Sorry. It is. Large, chocolatey & gooey with a honking scoop of vanilla and a smattering of fresh raspberries. I can't even finish it. 

I'm looking forward to pulling up to bar and hammering through some of their delicious and affordable bar bites...soon....very soon."}
{"text":"Run Forest Run!!! I brought the for what was supposed to be a great, once in a lifetime, The ambience and service were great but not the reason to go to Mortons. this was supposed to be an unforgettable bucket list meal. I feel sooooooo screwed!!!.....I've eaten at some fine restaurants like Peter Lugars', Uncle Jacks and others and this ain't them. I've had aged steaks and they say these are aged and the only thing that matches an aged steak is the price.  These are good not great steaks and don't even resemble aged beef. But a lot of people won't even catch it. Sides are overpriced as is everything, steaks are average, 5 jumbo shrimp isn't worth 23 bucks but you pay for the dry ice cloud it sits in I guess, and the big screwing that really pissed me off was the worst effin ever 16 ounce lobster tail at 100$ apeice Lobster meat texture was mushy, black sections from bad processing and blood clots, meat was bland and no ocean taste but also watery from sitting in thaw water or holding pan in the fridge, BIGGEST effin restaurant mistake of my life!!!! I'm no yuppie food channel chef with restaurant in Vegas but I have been a chef in the officers dining areas of the USMC, Marriott and Hilton kitchens and raised on beef farms in the Midwest. Tried to show these people the best of the US to remember forever in their home country but after a bill over 900$ for 4, I feel bent over in Pelican Bay way with no astroglide. Never going here again!!!! I can't believe with all the steak places in Vegas that are a better value for product, I go into this place!!!! Man!!! am I a ripped off dumbass!!!  I'd have done better in a hole in the wall Thai restaurant.  Feel free to call me a dumbass and I'll agree with you. I effed up 900$ bigtime but hope if you go you have a better experience and not feel culinarily raped. should of hauled them to Sapphires, machine gun experience of helicopter tour.... As Chris Farley said \"stupid, stupid I'm soooo stupid\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend has taken me here for my birthday almost every year. I always find the experience wonderful. 

They have custom 'Happy Birthday menus' for you. They take/print a picture of you/spouse for you to take home. Everyone stops by and wishes you a happy birthday. 50% of the time I got a free dessert. 

We usually go around 5:30 so it's pretty quiet, not a lot of people. My birthday landed on a Monday the one year and we had the whole dinning room to ourselves.

The foods always wonderful. Staff is always wonderful. 
It is ridiculously expensive so coming here once a year just the right amount."}
{"text":"Hmm. I am usually a big fan of Morton's but this one was just okay. My order was simple: cajun ribeye (medium rare) and a side of creamed spinach. And while the steak was cooked to the right temperature, the lack of seasoning was noticeable. In fact, I had to use the salt shaker to liven things up, which is odd since the cajun seasoning usually adds plenty of sodium to the dish. Likewise, I've definitely had better creamed spinach at Morton's -- again, the lack of salt was evident. 

That said, everything else about this Morton's was just as you'd expect: black interior, professional service, and a tasty happy hour if you're into that sort of thing. But I ultimately judge steak houses by, well, the steak they serve. And here at Morton's in Pittsburgh, it just didn't live up to what I expect from such a pricey joint.

Hugs,
C"}
{"text":"Wow, our server Shawna was amazing. She's all smiles and very friendly plus very knowledgeable about the menu. It's our 21st anniversary. I have to say that our dinner was amazing. I had the 8oz Lobster Tail, and my husband had the Porterhouse. We got our picture taken. We had a wonderful dessert, it was a chocolate soufflé. Our first time trying it :D very good. Thank you for making our anniversary so perfect..."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING !!!! The staff is A++ and the food is incredible. I definitely commend them on their happy hour 7 days a week 3-630 bar bites only . The music is up to part and the food is amazing . I always get my regular. 
4 petite filet Mignon and the trio as well as the chicken goujonettes . I'm a real fan and visit multiple times in the month . Just Amazing !!!  Would have pictures if my food wasn't already gone :)"}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding - the reason for not giving 5 stars was the price of alcoholic drinks - this was the only thing I would tell future dinners to look out for while being a guest at Morton's."}
{"text":"I'm the girl who goes to a steakhouse and orders salmon. Go ahead, throw rocks at me. 

Okay, so not every time. I love a good steak, but for some reason the chili glazed goodness was calling my name last week. A group of six friends came here to celebrate a birthday. Before I get to the food, I have to talk about the special touches they did for the birthday. They made us personalized menus that said Happy Birthday Jason at the top. Our server also took a group pic of the table and made a special card with it. Great stuff. 

And now to the feast. We ordered for the table jumbo shrimp Alexander and from the specials menu: crab stuffed mushrooms and bacon steak. How could we not order something called bacon steak?! Spoiler alert: worth every calorie. We also got some lobster bisque and wedge salads. The wedge was massive. The clear steak winner for the table was the Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye. I wanted it, but knew there was no way possible I could finish it. Andrea and Jason split one. Great idea and I highly recommend. Back to my salmon, I thought it was delicious. The succotash type goodness under it was also really good. We ordered a bunch of sides to split. My winner was the horseradish mashed potatoes. Warning: they pack a punch. I also got a boozy coffee drink for my post-dinner dessert. It was good, but I was way too full by that point to completely enjoy it. 

Our server was fantastic. She took a lot of time to explain the menu and go over options. She was also really honest with her answers, which I completely appreciate. She didn't BS or lie. The manager also came over to check in on us and see how the evening was going.

Now Morton's is not something that works with my budget as a frequent stop, but it is a nice option as a special occasion place. The bar is also a great place to hang out for a drink or a bite. My friend Kevin swears by the burger."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain and it's a mighty Super steakhouse. It comes pretty close to many of the major steakhouses in some of the Las Vegas hotels. Not far from the strip its a short and cheap cab ride. Simple one page menu and not as noisy as most other steakhouse so the strip. Everything is good. If you like a veal chop look no further. Totally awesome in their own truffle butter sauce. The filet mignon is awesome. Plenty of side fixings to order from. Very attentive wait staff. Definitely will eat here again"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I randomly stopped in and sat at the bar to get dinner. The service was good, the bartender offered good suggestions. I ordered the center cut iceberg to start and the bartender suggest we share it and I'm glad we did, it was huge and so delicious! They were out of the twice baked au gratin potatoes so he suggested the mashed cauliflower which was also delicious and a healthier choice so we were happy with that. All in all the food was great and so was the bar service."}
{"text":"This place in true fairness should have at least 3.5 stars for multiple reasons. We meaning me and my daughter stopped in for the happy hour specials. The oyster were below average with the small pieces of shell in our oyster. They were extremely busy for happy hour. The service was actually terrible but as people started to leave the service got better and better. The shrimp and Shirley temples are great. The filet mignon sliders are very good. The artichoke dip that has spinach and a I cannot recall what seafood is not so good and the bread they provide to go with it taste very processed (gross) The burger sliders were yum, and so was the lava cake. I would only come back because I have this gift card. This place is okay but not worth the money for the service, and they are not memorable. Forgive the grammatical errors"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 37'th wedding anniversary here last evening and we enjoyed everything from the food to the service!  We were warmly greeted and immediately shown to our table.  Our waitress Victoria was friendly, helpful and very attentive but not intrusive!  She went above and beyond to make sure our dinner was perfect.  My filet came out a bit over done and she recognized that and before I even realized she had the chef prepare another which came out quickly and cooked perfectly!!!  A lovely restaurant that we will dine at again!!!
Definitely a five star experience!  Ask for Victoria!"}
{"text":"Great Place for Valentine day dinner!!!! I took my gf to here and walked out HAPPY! 

Service: good, i felt kind of weird when our waiter comes by every time and when he takes our order or check on us, he blinks continuously.  But overall, service was great.

Food: we order the seafood platter(chilled), ribeye steak, and filet migon.
 
seafood: everything was super cold, all the seafood portion(lobster, oyster, shrimp, crab meat, scallop)  was a little small for me if Im paying $50. But everything was good except for the oyster. Dont get me wrong the quality was excellent, but i ate one, there was tons of small fragments of their shell on it. I had to spit it out, what a waste of good oyster.

ribeye: EXCELLENT!!!! High end quality and taste was perfect, super big, worth the money. 

filet: the gf asked for medium well, we got medium well, i told her to tell the waiter,but she sticked with it. Blood was ozooing out and the meat was super red. 

Overall like it. if your looking for a great place to go with ur gf or bf (for you ladies and guys), then this is the place."}
{"text":"Came to Morton's and brought some employees while on a trade show trip in Vegas. Michael's service was up to and beyond what is expected from Morton's. The food was top quality. Michael made a great wine recommendation that went very well with our steak. Will definitely come back while in town for business or leisure."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Morton's we were exhausted and we'd had a cruddy week working a convention. To be blunt, we didn't want to be there. Our friends insisted and treated us to dinner. They also ordered things we normally would avoid and force-fed us. Let me tell you, this was a GREAT thing. First off, you MUST have the Tuna Tartare. Yeah yeah - its raw and not your thing? Trust me, it's unbelievable. We tasted a bit just to be polite, then had to order one for ourselves because it's just that good. No fishiness at all, melt-in-your-mouth texture. I think this dish is reason enough to go there. After that we got some steaks and mushrooms, and I think we got every side available to share with the group. After one bite of that dinner, we forgot about our sucky day and had a great time. The server was attentive, classy and amusing. The food was outstanding. No wonder this place has the reputation they do. Don't expect to leave without emptying your wallet, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Well I have read a lot about this place, so to be fair, I more a full flavor kind of guy. That being said, I will give my review. 
To begin, the facility was very well maintained and the greeter was great and knowledgable of the situation. It was my anniversary and as we came in they wished us a happy anniversary etc. This was a nice touch for my wife who was happy about the recognition. We were seated promptly and again presented with a menu that stated \"Happy 4th Anniversary\" at the top. Again, my wife was excited by the touch. Our waiter, recommended a few things, but we had studied the menu prior, and we already knew what we wanted. A small annoyance was the waiter telling us everything we ordered was \"the best\" and twenty minutes later, a table next to us was seated. He then used words like \"honestly that is the best\" about other items. I understand he is working hard for tips, but if he focus more of his attention to our needs throughout the meal as opposed to buttering us up, he would get a better tip in my opinion but I digress. 
Our first appetizer was the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella which has heirloom tomato in the middle and was covered in a balsamic sauce and sat upon red onion and arugula. This was hands down the best dish of the night.  This is a must have. My wife hates cheese, and she even loved it. 

Next was the main course. I ordered the 5 peppercorn strip steak and I must say it was ok. On scale of 1-10, 10 being the best I ever had, I'd give it a 6.5. It was just not salted well and it also sat on a pepper corn sauce. That ironically saved the steak. In my opinion a great steak needs no sauce.  To be continued....."}
{"text":"Most of the facets of our meal of Thursday, 11 February 2016, were marvelous as usual, particularly the server and the host staff.  I asked for onion on my Caesar salad, which was not brought.  Everything else was presented as ordered.  The glaring flaw was the braised short rib entrée ($35).  It was delicious, but I was stunned by the tiny portion size, suitable for only a child.  The diner should be warned that this dish is for those who are not hungry!  The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were delicious."}
{"text":"Good service.  Staff knew we were celebrating my birthday and took very good care of us.  However, there were a few odd things:  
1. Red velvet cocktail: this is a cheap lambic beer in a tiny flute that will cost you $14.00 each.  All alcohol is overpriced here to the point of being insulting to the patron.
2.  This place is supposed to be top-notch, so you would think the guy and girl dressed like they were going bowling would be turned away.  Nope.  Everyone else was dressed rather fancy, even the staff.  This place used to be strict about dress code; it's a real turn off when they're not.
3.  Price.  The filet, scallops and shrimp were good; however, not as good as the price warranted.  Dinner for three, with only two sides and three beers, was $300.  I will not be doing this again, because it was not a \"$300 dining experience\".
4.  The place was LOUD.  So loud you could barely hear your table mates.

This place is expensive, loud and not romantic.  There were children and babies.  Don't take a date here.  Take him/her to John Q's, Pier W or Hyde Park. 
Morton's is a solid steakhouse but you'll pay through the nose.
Pros: valet was only $10.00.  Also, a complimentary photo and dessert was included because we were celebrating a birthday. ($17 value).  These were unexpected surprises and I was wished a happy birthday about ten times before I left!"}
{"text":"Where does one begin?  We changed plans at the last moment to avoid the strip and Morton's was able to accommodate us at the perfect time.  From the moment we stepped out of the cab, we were treated like royalty.  The cocktails were divine, the wine list was tremendous and the food was amazing.  But what made our first New Year's Eve together joyfully memorable was the service.  Everyone at Morton's went out of their way to take great care of us and celebrate the night.  Kevin was our Host, at least it felt that way, and he was perfect from start to finish!  Even though he had to work in NYE, he mad it seem like he didn't want to be anywhere else.  I actually cannot wait to go back and will definitely ask for Kevin.  Thank you Morton's!!  Happy New Year Everyone!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything about my experience at this restaurant. Looking for a great steakhouse? Go here!"}
{"text":"Service can really make or break a restaurant.

I took my wife here for valentine's day this year. We were both pretty excited to eat here because a few friends had recommended this place. When we first walked in it was such a nice atmosphere. The hostess was great and we were seated right away in a nice booth in front of the kitchen. Here is where my problem starts and why I rated only 3 stars. We sat there without a menu for almost 40 min with all the waiters and waitresses going by our table looking at us and walking away. No one came to check on us and we had no clue who the server for our table was. I flagged down two people in those 40 min and they both apologized and said they'd get someone here right away but no one came. We were about to just get up and walk out when finally a nice waitress came to our table with menues. Clearly she had just been assigned our table and had 3 other tables. The restaurant wasn't even busy but the other 3 waiters and waitresses only had 1 table each. We felt bad for her so we stayed and ordered our food. 

The food was excellent. No complaints and after the initial 40 min wait we were starving and we had to get to heinz hall for a concert. We were worried that we wouldn't finish our food in time because of the 40 min wait for the menu. But everything worked out in the end. 

My wife and I love to eat at good resraurants. We don't get much time together because of our careers so once a month we make a date and go out. I had heard such good things about this place and they weren't wrong. The food was excellent. But the service that night really put us off."}
{"text":"99% of the time, I sit in the bar area... Happy hour prices and food choices are outstanding.  Food is perfectly cooked every single time.  Service is impeccable.... and the oysters, mmm mmm mmmm.... even though its a steak house, the oysters are always delicious and perfectly shucked!"}
{"text":"Morton's is an old classic without question. From that old school steakhouse service to their dry aged delicious steaks, everything is nearly perfect.  

My fiance took me here for our anniversary and we were treated like royalty. The manager even printed us our own personalized menu for the day. In addition, they have someone who comes around to take your picture, and they put it in a cardholder with a special message. We really felt special.

We took advantage of the steak and lobster special, which was just the right amount of food. You might think 6oz is not big enough for a steak, but honestly with the sides and bread, I was so stuffed I couldn't even finish my food. I was in a serious food coma by the time we left.

The only negative thing are the sauces that they charge you and extra $5 for. It's quite a rip off.  And they come in this giant sauce dish, so you could easily share with 2 people, which our server neglected to tell us and we both ordered the blue cheese butter and could definitely have saved $5.  

Other than that, the food was amazing, the service was amazing, and we left feeling very full, satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Our first time visit to the restaurant was on a Friday night in October at 6pm. It was not busy, and we were promptly seated. We have dined at Sullivan's, Del Friscos, & BLT Steak in the Charlotte area, so we are familiar with upscale steakhouses. To begin with, the music playing was horrible...like horrible elevator music. The food was average & almost disappointing, and most definitely not worth the prices. The bread was dry, and almost over cooked with burnt onion seasoning on top. The steak was good & correctly prepared, but not amazing as you would expect from the expensive price. My average martini was $16...what on earth? To sum it up, too expensive for just average food & drink."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for their renovating event, however I had never been to Morton's before it was renovated, but whatever they did - looked great. =)  The GM told us that they opened up the kitchen, so customers could look in on the chefs, they had new tables and chairs, carpeting, and redid there banquet rooms (I believe there was three).  The only part of the restaurant I didn't like was the lighting, it felt to bright/florescent. They offered a variety of light appetizers, such as crab cake sandwich's/shredded beef sandwich's (the bread used for these was way too thick and took away from the meat in the sandwich), tuna tartars, cheesecake, bruschetta (perfectly seasoned), ex.  The also offered a wide variety or wine and alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of five star reviews because it basically makes me look like a schill.  I have been to this Morton's three times, two of them have been my past two birthdays.  The service has always been great and on your birthday they even print you up a menu with your name at the top as well as take your picture and sign a little card.  The food has always been amazing!  Whenever we have gone we've had the Steak and Seafood dinner for Two.  Each person gets a salad, entree, two veggie sides, a choice of seafood, and a dessert for a grand total of $109.  How can that be beat?  My steak has always been perfectly medium rare, the scallops are sizable, and the Lyonaise potatoes are delicious!  I'm not a big fan of Key Lime Pie but I think it is very good at Morton's.  And that Onion Loaf?  I could eat the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food! 
It is a great place for lunch meetings too.  It always feels private. Never rushed."}
{"text":"Worst staff ever. Most entitled attitudes and place has gone downhill. Burnt steaks and no attention to detail. Place really is not even run as well as a Red Robin. Really wasted my evening. Such a waste, I guess times are changing for the worst."}
{"text":"Made a surprise reservation here for my friends' 10th anniversary. I was a year off but close enough. It was their first time celebrating an anniversary (shakes heads) and we all wanted to really enjoy ourselves.

Reservations aren't really needed, plenty of seating. There is also a private room, too. Anyway, my boyfriend decides to order for everyone. Ahi tuna tower, a dozen oysters, porterhouse steak for 2, sea bass, mashed cauliflower, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. Oh, and two bottles of wine. In addition to cocktails. Booze-filled dinner. Perfect for a 10-odd or so year anniversary dinner. 

I was not expecting such delicious oysters from Morton's. Morton's is in Las Vegas, in the middle of the desert for goodness sake but these oysters... Wow. They were very, very clean and we all agreed that was some of the best darn tasting oysters we've ever slurped. Ahi tuna, I've had better. Sea bass, the guys demolished that poor fish in minutes. Porterhouse was perfect for the 4 of us. Cooked medium rare, this chunk of perfectly cooked, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth, piece of ambrosia was worth the $128 tag. The sides were tasty and what made me sad was there were no leftovers to bring back to the hotel. We demolished everything on that table. Except for that second bottle of wine. We had to to-go it. 

Our server was phenomenal. An Asian guy with bleached hair. He was so kind and patient with our table, I regret not getting his name to properly address him but thank you for making our night so enjoyable! 

The bill was over $500/$600 but it's Morton's. Oh well. Just win it back at the roulette table. Thank you, Morton's!"}
{"text":"Mortons is a fine old school steakhouse in Yorkville. Lots of dark wood, white linen, wine racks, etc. steaks are always done to perfection and sides are tasty and made for sharing. Service is generally good. Pricey but satisfying."}
{"text":"Morton's Steakhouse featured a $99 \"Steak and Seafood\" special, so the Big F and I took advantage of this offer for what we hoped would be a fine dining experience.

The restaurant wasn't particularly overly busy this past Friday as we were seated at our table.  The waiter inquired about our beverage choices before telling us about the menu.  He soon returned with a cart that held examples of the cuts of beef available, the vegetables that accompanied it, and other various dining choices.  It can be a bit overwhelming as he goes over what the restaurant offers, but not to worry since it's all on the menu anyway.

They start you off with a large loaf of bread, and it doesn't matter if you're dining by yourself or with a group, you still get this loaf of onion bread.  (I did ask what they did with the leftover loaf, hoping that they might donate it or something.  No luck.  Into the trash it goes!)

For salads, we both chose the \"Morton's Salad with Morton's Blue Cheese Dressing, Chopped Egg, and Anchovies.\"  It's a combination of romaine and iceberg lettuce leaves.  It would help if they cut the leaves down a bit because it was a mess to eat.  The dressing was alright, nothing special about it being their own blue cheese dressing.  The anchovies added the perfect saltiness, but I'm sure the anchovies were not their own.

With our special dinner of a single cut of filet mignon comes a choice of an appetizer.  I went for the \"Broiled Sea Scallops Wrapped in Bacon with Apricot Chutney.\"  The Big F had the \"Jumbo Lump Crab Cake with Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce.\"  My scallops were good, and what isn't good with bacon?  The sweetness of the chutney added a nice contrast as well.  The crab cake was pretty good too, made with lots of crab and less filler.  They could do a lot better though with the presentation of our meal.  The Big F's plate looked like something was missing!  

However, the real problem we both had was with the beef.  Although it was perfectly cooked to how we ordered it (rare), it was ultimately tasteless.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I had my share of filet mignons and I'm used to a smooth taste where the meat melts in your mouth and has you feeling like heaven landed in your mouth.  This wasn't the case here.  It wasn't just my opinion about this tasteless beef, the Big F was on the same page as well.  We ultimately had to ask for Worchestire sauce to douse it so it had some flavor.  (It does come with a side of Bearnaise Sauce, but I've had much better.)  Perhaps we should have said something to the staff about our entrees, and yes, that was our mistake.  It was my first time dining at Morton's and I figure this is how they do their filets. (The Big F usually gets their Cajun Ribeye Steak when he's there, so he had no previous experience with their filet mignons either.)

Our choice side dishes were the \"Macaroni & Cheese with a Hint of Spice\" and \"Lyonnaise Potatoes.\"  The mac & cheese was alright.  I prefer it to have a smoother and creamier texture, but this had that graininess in it.  The Big F did like their choice of pasta for it though.  The potatoes were pretty tasty, cooked with lots of onions.

For dessert, the choices were either Chocolate Cake or Key Lime Pie.  Well, I wish I knew it was actually called \"Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake\" because it was really good.  It had a molten center that was oozed out so nicely when I cut into it.  It was probably the saving grace of the meal.  But because I had finished my tasteless piece of meat, I was too stuffed to finish my dessert and ice cream.  (In retrospect, I would have brought the meat home and recooked it instead.)  The Big F's Key Lime Pie was good too, not as good as the Chocolate Molten Cake though.  We probably would have finished that as well if we had put the meat to the side.

Service was good at some points.  Our beverage glasses were never empty due to the water boys constantly refilling our glasses.  Our waiter checked on us once during our meal, and that's when we asked for the Worchestire sauce.  But I don't recall him coming around much after that.

Overall, my meal at Morton's Steakhouse was disappointing.  Perhaps my taste preferences just don't align with how Morton's does their filet mignons here.  They have raving reviews, so maybe it's just my bad luck that I got a tasteless piece of beef.  Anyway, I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon though.

They do have a happy hour and reverse happy hour.  It was advertised in the restrooms!

(Pics of our dinner are posted!)"}
{"text":"WOW!  I think I had a meatgazim here.  The Cajun rib eye was delicious and was wonderfully paired with a Petite Shiraz (Spellbound.)  The service was exquisite and the waitress was attentive.  We decided to go to this restaurant to celebrate my husbands birthday and the top of the menu stated Happy Birthday along with my husbands name.  They later sang happy birthday to him as they brought out their delicious Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake.  I will not hesitate to visit this Morton's as well as its other locations."}
{"text":"It's rare that I would give a steakhouse five stars but the steak here was so good I can't stop myself.  We had a cajon ribeye that was truly incredible.  The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare).  There was no gristle on any bite.  I am a big streak eater an this was the beat steak I've ever had   Jason was a great waiter and Mark made sure our experience was great   Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Morton's food through work. My experience there was all right. Compared to my dining experience at Ruth's Steakhouse, Morton's paled in comparison. The filet mignon I ordered was not cooked to the medium rare I had requested. However, the waiting staff provided excellent service so I have no complaints about their service. There are other steakhouses in Pittsburgh that offer a better steakhouse experience."}
{"text":"I used to love Morton's and recommend them to others. I've given other locations 5-star reviews in three cities. But this is my first visit since they were bought by Landry's and there is a marked drop in overall quality. The meat presentation is gone, and neither filet was as tender and flavorful as in the past. They cooked medium-rare perfectly, but medium was overcooked (probably carry over, I would stick to med-rare from now on). I couldn't believe that the creme brulee had no custard flavor, stick with the molten cake. The service was still good, if missing the flair of the meat presentation.

I won't be back, or recommend Morton's to others anymore."}
{"text":"For an amuse-bouche of fine dining, and an excellent prime, dry aged steak, Mortons is a great place to go. I like the \"Frank Sinatra\" atmosphere, with the double entrance that whisks you from a mall into a private, masculine setting with dark woods, quiet music, attentive service, and views into the kitchen.

I've had most of their steaks, the best being the double porterhouse carved tableside, ordered by my wife for my birthday. Yum! I have also had on occasion the filet, new york strip, and ribeye both regular and 'blackened' (regular is better, the steak has plenty of flavor on its own). I'm least impressed by the weekend-only Prime Rib (which was huge, 22+ ounces and requires reservation).

The sides always fresh and huge (read: sharable), and you don't need appetizers given entree portion sizes,but we have had shrimp Alexander which my wife is in love with, and the wedge salad is about half of a head of iceberg.

Do save room for the renowned molten chocolate cake a la mode, even if it means packing up some of your steak - just make sure you reheat your leftovers properly, in a broiler not the microwave!!

We have enjoyed Morton's in Arizona and Pennsylvania, and always experience the same level of service and quality ingredients. I will say that the competition is fiercer in Las Vegas, though."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and were told that seating was on time, we waited 15 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. The food was awful, my pregnant fiancé ordered a filet medium rare that came out medium well!  Who cooks a filet medium well?  My father-in-laws strip was so over seasoned he could barely eat it.  But since we waited over an hour for our food, he had to eat it.  Our reservation was for 8:15 and we did not eat until after 10:00.  We all ordered medium rare steaks and one lobster tail.  It should not take over an hour to prepare.  The filet was taken off the bill, however, that does not help the fact that a pregnant women had to wait so long to eat and when it came out she didn't even eat.  I shared mine with her as did her dad share his, but as mentioned above, his steak was awful too.  My Cajun ribeye was good and so was my mother-in-laws lobster.  We ordered chocolate soufflé for dessert and it didn't even have chocolate on it.  It tasted like scrambled eggs with whipped cream.  I have to tell you that was by far one of the worst dining experiences we have had.  The four of us eat out together once a week and tend to go to more \"pricey\" restaurants.  This was terrible and I am sure we do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Starchy and excessive are the way I would describe Morton's.  The perfect 1980's men's club.  Food is good but way too much.  For white North American male celebration of excess and indulgence Morton's is the place.  I suspect the waste could feed a 3rd world country though"}
{"text":"After several visits to this Mortons site we were excited to bring one of our guests for an amazing meal. We wanted to catch the second half of a televised college football game so we made the decision to eat and drink at the bar. Lucky for us, when we arrived there was lots of room at the bar and the game we wanted to watch was already on the TV. We sat down and ordered cocktail right away. The bartender served us up and we enjoyed the drinks and the game. After about 20 mins we asked for menus and the service went downhill after that. We were stunned. Three of us ordered salads, entrees and several sides. One of the entrees came out and it was the wrong dish. No big deal but the other two ate while the third in our party waited without any excuses or apologies. I could go on and on about the lack of service but why? The sommelier was polite me attentive after we ordered wine. The bar back stepped it up and tried to cover for lack of attention and service by the head bartendress.   Hundreds of dollars later we left and will probably not return. We have been so happy on prior visits but the complete lack of service (begging for water and silverware) is unacceptable at these prices. There are so many great choices in the Scottsdale area, don't waste your money here. The food was ok but this visit left a bitter taste and wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Morton's is my favorite steak place to date. And quality is consistent across locations, as my recent experience at the Las Vegas Morton's proves.

{"text":"Came on a sunday right when they opened at 5 for a nice happy hour date.
Loved the vibe and decor. Dark wooden walls and floors, blood red velvet chairs with hints of gold trim. Definitely a classy looking joint for a good steak.
Unfortunetly, we didnt get any steaks, just the seafood platter and many many oysters!
The platter for two and just enough crab, the lobster was very juicy, shrimp was meaty, and the oysters were so big and delicious we ordered a dozen more on the side. Couldnt resist!!!
It also came with 2 large seared scallops but were chilled. The cajun spice coating was great, but being used to eating hot seared scallops it threw me off a bit.
Got the brussel sprouts as a side, served with bacon bits and shallots. What doesnt taste good with bacon and shallots, seriously! Delicious!
Potato bread was nice and warm, fluffy, perfect.
Best part....dessert!!!
They brought a live dessert menu over with all the choices on the platter!! Soooo cool.
We chose the creme brulee and cheesecake. The brulee had perfectly flamed sugar crust almost like a layer of candy! The creme was sweetened nicely, and the cheesecake was served plain with strawberrys. I just wish they would have served it with some sort of sauce.
With all this, cappucinos, and a round of drinks, the bill came to 140, I was impressed.

All in all great service, sound ambience, and excellent job with the food. I WILL be back, especially for those oysters! Good job Mortons on my first visit"}
{"text":"Came here for my 20th birthday on a monday night with my 3 other family members. Were greeted with a super friendly host that quickly sat us. He then proceeded to print out a specialized menu reading \"happy 20th birthday!\" Which was an awesome touch. Then he came over, took a picture of us, printed it out and gave us a pamphlet with the picture reading \"happy birthday from your friends at mortons\". The food was honestly some of the best Ive had in my entire life. Filet mignon was done perfectly, the bacon mac n cheese was insanely good. They gave a free HUGE piece of chocolate cake. Out server was a woman named Leanne and she was AWESOME. Overall great experience, especially for a birthday."}
{"text":"I've been to Morton's several times, but only once at this Scottsdale location. Overall, the steak does not get any better than what they cook and serve at Morton's (and I have made my rounds and tried many places in all pricing ranges). It is moderately priced, but it it is worth it. 
My wife and I most recently came for our anniversary. Not only did they personalize the menu for us to celebrate our anniversary, they also took a picture, printed it, inserted it into a card, and gave it to us. Also the dessert was gratis as well. 
The food, on all occasions had been some of the best food. The steaks (I love ribeyes) are tender and melt in your mouth with a satisfying flavor. The sides are enough to share and delicious as well, including salads. 
The ambiance at the Scottsdale location is dark and classy, but I do miss the more classic feel of the Camelback/Biltmore location. 
Service was good at the Scottsdale location, but I did enjoy the presentation of the menu that we were used to from the Camelback/Biltmore location. Not only did the visualization help, but also it increased our appetites. :-)
I would recommend skipping drinks (except maybe wine). The value is poor as well as the pour. A rum and coke was a little weak, but my wife got a vodka drink with Smirnoff (their well vodka) and it was overpowering for her. Either way, $30 for two drinks is probably not worth it, even though the bar staff was great."}
{"text":"Excellent steak and service as you would expect from Morton's.  Great selection of food and beverages to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"One of my regular hangs when I get into the City.  They offer free steak sliders at happy hour.  You can order off of the full menu in the bar.  The menu is pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Morton's. Yes a chain, but as a guy, and a steaklover, this is a top notch steakhouse. I was a little biased because I used to live right across the street from it, but that didnt change the fact that its a good steakhouse. A total dark (or dim lit) mood steakhouse with prime cuts of steak. Well aged. Great drinks. Excellent service. One of the better Morton's that Ive been to around the country."}
{"text":"We had the filet mignon, sour cream mashed potatoes, grilled brussels sprouts, sautéed wild mushrooms, chocolate mousse and the seasonal fruit crisp. For drinks we had the fire and ice and the secret garden.  

The meat was not as favorable as we expected. But the side dishes were really yummy. The mushrooms had the best presentation, and the mashed potatoes were perfect! The seasonal crisp was better than the chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"$16 to $18 may be a tad much for a drink, and the shrimp cocktail may not be at its freshest, but the steak is absolutely amazing and perfect in every way. Melt in your mouth steak. The hot baked chocolate dessert is also very rich and tasty. Atmosphere is super fancy. I think the menu presentation is very unique and cute. The big warm onion loaf you get with butter after you order was a nice surprise. Super delicious place but very expensive."}
{"text":"Think twice about coming here!!! Seriously think twice!! This is probably the worst morton steakhouse in the country. I've been to los angeles and the beverly hills one but this one is definetely one of the worst in the country.

We have a server who never introduced his name after we were waiting for more than 10 minutes. He then come by and say there was a mix up on whose table he supposed to serve on? What kind of management is that?? Considering that we even have reservation.

It tooks 45 minutes to get some appetisers and then another hour for steak to arrive. Are you really that busy?? Do you know we are paying more than $600 to get that kind of treatment?

Absolutely never come here. He even put the steak at the wrong place!! I ordered medium and get medium rare while my girl ordered a medium rare and get a medium. 

How f up can u be if you dont even know how to serve one table?  From my experience, I would never come to this steakhouse anymore, if you are in Las Vegas and u want to pay a satisfying steakhouse, go to Vick and Anthonys in Golden Nugget. Now thats' a steakhouse!!!!"}
{"text":"Morton's is my absolute \"Go To\" when it comes to a serious steak. My wife and I come here every time we're in town. This happen to be our third visit to this location in 2 years. Trust me, we know what a good steak is and all of the competition has nothing on Morton's. 

 We started dinner with a small batch cucumber gin on the rocks and a very dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. We both had the Lobster Bisque. As always, it was absolutely delicious. My wife had the Morton's Ribeye (Medium) and I had the Cajun Ribeye (Rare). I tell them to grill mine as it runs past. That's how I like my steak. Anyhow, both super tender, juicy and delicious as usual. We also had the delicious heirloom carrots as a side. 

 The reason why I love Morton's versus other steakhouses is the consistency. They are spot on every time, unlike all of the hit and miss competition. 

 I honesty do not give 5 starts to anyone, but Morton's truly deserves it. 

 I'd also like to say Thank you to our waiter Charles. Not only did he recommend my fantastic drink, his service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Wao!... Mortons is the exact definition of taking something simple and ordinary and making it EXTRAORDINARY

If you though you had a good steak at The Keg once, you have no idea whats waiting for you here... This was just soo goood, and not just the steak. Everything was amazing! Even the bread was an experience... 

I recommend you go in a group so you can try several types of steak -my personal favorite was the NY- and several side dishes -my personal favorite was the creamed spinach- .

At 80$ per person its definitely a very expensive meal. But if your going to spend the money somewhere. This place will not let you down"}
{"text":"My review might be a little jaded, because I've eaten at the ones in New York.
This place is an upscale, pricey steakhouse.
That's not a complaint, that's just what it is.
The steaks are fantastic, the service is excellent, the atmosphere is darker than what I'm used to.
This place is a little off the beaten path (one or two blocks removed from the strip), so I imagine that most of their business is from regulars or people that know the name (or for people who inquire about an upscale steakhouse.)
I think that a group of fraternity members, visiting from out of town, are more likely to go to Cabo Wabo than to stumble upon this place and go inside.
In any event, I would consider this place as a fine-dining restaurant.
One menu Item that I would highly recommend is their \"molten chocolate cake\".
You have to order them in advance, so don't forget."}
{"text":"Best Steak!  We never knew a steak could be so tender, and carrot cake wow....wonderful service we really appreciate the coat check.  Our server was Burshan great positive presents.  Management and staff take pride providing excellance.

Regarding handicap very accommodating.

Delightful evening feast...."}
{"text":"Server was fantastic!!! We decided to share a meal because it was late and the portions are quite large. We had the Morton's salad, Chicken Bianco & Horseradish Mashed Potatoes - yum yum and yum!!! We have been here before for Christmas Parties so have never been able to order what we like so we were excited to try some new stuff and glad to say we were not disappointed. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This was definitely a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Although it was extremely pricy, you get what you're paying for. The food and service were unbelievable and while you're there, you feel like royalty. Definitely give this place two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We just love the happy hour!  Great small bites, great beverages at a great price.  so much fun."}
{"text":"My wife and I had reservations at another restaurant on the strip for our anniversary, but it was a holiday weekend and I didn't want to risk having a bad experience due to crowds. Good friend told me to call Morton's and let them know it was our anniversary and I am glad I did. Took a short cab ride from the Venetian and were there in 10 mins. We were greeted at the front, wished a happy anniversary, and walked right to our table. Server was very personable and got us started with a couple drinks and an appetizer. The server had excellent timing. He knew when to ask us when we were ready to order and didn't make us feel rushed at all. The bacon wrapped mozzarella was excellent. Waiter recommended the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella and it did not disappoint. We skipped the salads so we wouldn't get too full before the main course. My wife ordered the 6oz filet \"Oscar Style\". It was cooked to her liking and she really enjoyed it. I got the special, which was a bone-in filet. It was absolutely delicious. So tender and cooked just right. The sides (mushrooms and were Lyonnaise potatoes) were both very tasty with no complaints from the wife. As an added bonus the waiter informed us that dessert was on them and gave us a few options to choose from. Although we were extremely full, we went with the chocolate lava cake with ice cream. It came on a plate with a single lit candle. Nice touch. This was our first experience with Morton's and we were not disappointed. Next time we are in Vegas and want a nice steak, we will make a reservation at Morton's."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very classy, from the dimly lit dining area to the beautiful bar.  I was at a party here with 100+ people and the event was smooth as silk!  The servers were fast and polite and Oh So accommodating.  They would switch plates with ease to suit the palate of the customers.  They remembered who had what and who needed special attention.  They didn't let a glass get empty or a table stay dirty.
The food was very good.  For a starter we had crab cake along with scallops and bruschetta.  Main dish was salmon with potatoes and green beans.  Desert was fresh berries.  I had this with herbal tea.  It was a great meal.
Upon leaving, the doorman promptly summoned us a taxi.
It was a good night.  I highly recommend this restaurant for a date or party!"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST STEAKS ANYWHERE!!! Great staff as well. It is a go to place for us when we are in the mood for steaks!!"}
{"text":"best steak EVER  EVER  EVER
cajun rib eye ......juicy .. tasteful .... cooked to perfection

great service 

after bad experience at McCormick & Schmick's ... it was completely the opposite here

Cody was my server ... happy guy with outgoing personality .. attentive but not overbearing....

the manager was exceptional .......

pricey but well with it

Cody recommended the fresh spinach salad .. I'm not a salad guy but this was exceptional, diced salad and vinaigrette, chopped bacon, diced egg .....it was great!!

if there are better steaks .... i'm truly scared to eat them.

N -  JOY!"}
{"text":"Was there for a small wedding reception.  We were in a private room.  The food was wonderful, the staff was great!!  If I am ever in Vegas again I will be sure to have a meal there!!"}
{"text":"Went to Mortons and the food was spot on. However, the service was not good. Waitress never checked on us, was not very farmiliar with menu. In the past the Wait staff was just as good at the food, but not this time. For the money spent we were highly disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here yesterday for our anniversary. They printed us specialized menus, and took our photo. The customer service was exceptional, and the food was outstanding. I ate the best steak I've ever had in my whole life. Thanks for making our day special."}
{"text":"Tonight begins Arizona restaurant week. I have some friends in town and they wanted to try this Morton's. I have eaten at Morton's in Chicago and in Kansas City but I have never eaten at this location.
Sometimes it's good with our restaurant week to try a restaurant that you have not tried before. 
Or in this case to eat at a restaurant that you know you will never eat at again
This restaurant is like stepping back in time, but not in a good way. Very low ceilings very dark restaurant. And even though it was a Friday night and the beginning of restaurant week the place was virtually empty. I only saw one person sitting in the bar.
The waitstaff had an irritating air to them. As if they were something incredibly special, in spite of the fact that the place was merely a graveyard. When we asked for the restaurant week menu, which they did not want to give us, they only brought one menu for the entire table.
I had the double Porkchop and it was in fact quite good. But everything else was average if not worse. The salads were soaked in dressing and did not have any sense of freshness. The Brockley was steamed but it was nearly flavorless. 
Sadly, the coffee that they served with dessert was one of the most flavorful items of the evening. This is a chain that has slipped away into bad ownership. It is grossly overpriced and the competition is obviously killing it 
Save yourself the time and money and pick a different restaurant"}
{"text":"Morton's The Steakhouse was one of my favorite restaurants. I have spent about $2500 at Morton's in six months. The first two visits were perfect. Unfortunately our last visit was a serious disappointment. The food was good, but the service was poor. Our table was too small for seven people and was right outside of the kitchen, but the real bad-apple was the server. She was inattentive, slow and error-prone. She didn't even bring out the dessert cart, and it was my Mom's 93rd birthday. I filled out the survey and scored it appropriately. The manager later called and seemed a little lackadaisical. I told him the story; he promised to send a gift card.

I just received a gift card for $25. That's right... $25, after spending $2500!

The gift card came from Sr. Vice President of Operations, Tim Whitlock. I really can't think of a better slap-in-the-face than a $25 gift card, after spending $2500."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey, but it's worth it for the amazing steak!
I recommend the Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye and Parmesan & Truffle Matchstick Fries for the side dish.
I'd come here again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"For five star service and steaks, Morton's is the place to go.

That said, I only gave this Morton's four stars because it's among the few Morton's I wouldn't return, despite the great food and service. Don't get me wrong, this one is beautiful and grand, like the room a rich grandma doesn't let you play in, but it's brightly lit, nothing like the dark darkness and swanky like the Vegas Morton's.  And it seems large, lacking the coziness of San Diego Morton's.  If you want dark and swanky, eat in the bar."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE:  Of the four Morton's I have visited, this was probably the best, though Gaslamp Quarter is nice and cozy.  Very modern and very dimly lit.  Probably the nicest bar of the four as well, and if it wasn't for the whole booth-moving crumb-scraping experience I'd consider eating in the bar if I didn't have a reservation.  

FOOD:
The creme brûlée is a safe choice for dessert- the other items are embarrassingly huge. The truffle cauliflower was great, but not at all what we expected: very heavy on the what we think was crusted parmesean cheese, a bit salty, and very pureed. The brussel sprouts side is excellent.  The wife got her steak well-done, and even though that's a culinary no-no, I must say it was still bomb.  At least she didn't ask for ketchup. Though my filet on my first visit was just Ok, my second cut was the usyal perfect, and the must-order mixed grill option adds three fat buttery shrimp and 2 bacon-wrapped scallops for only $5 more.  Do it.

SERVICE:
On a late Easter night, we had the place to ourselves, and had the lovely Audrey serve us. Our first visit was on a Christmas, and my wife's medium well steak was reddish pink and a bit cold, so we returned it.  Our awesome server Erica and the manager were so concerned with our great experience that they gave her a new lobster tail (she had eaten half hers), gave us an additional side of truffle cauliflower, and gave us a free dessert.  And even though we never complained (or maybe because we didn't), they comped her meal.  That's above and beyond. That's six stars.  I can't guarantee you'll get comped the way we did, but it's safe to say they clearly cared more about our experience than our money tonight.

Side note: Weird that we ate there on the celebration of Jesus Christ's birth and then his Ressurection. Our next visit will be on his Bar Mitzvah."}
{"text":"This is THE SH$T! Downtown at its finest. Honored to be in the after work crowd here! It's just all that! Money makes a difference my friends. Nice to see. Drinking with the highballers."}
{"text":"My $51 Cajun rib eye cooked medium was perfect. Added $5 of blue cheese butter just for the halibut (pun). Where it gets just plain ridiculous is the $15 genetically modified Chinese potato. Made 3 or 4 different ways for the same price. Nevertheless, I go for and will always go for my favorite steak here."}
{"text":"Morton's is a very classy steakhouse in my opinion.  As soon as we got seated the dining room felt like we were in a mafia movie! Which I thought was great. From the stitching in the booth seats all the way to our waiter, felt very classy.  I usually order an old fashion as my cocktail and unfortunately it tasted very flat.  I know every restaurant may have their own special way of making this drink however it wasn't good.  

The food items were very good.  Stuffed shrimp pasta, and the mac and cheese with bacon.  This spot was very pricey so make it worth it when you come here, don't be shy with that pocket book!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a special occasion just calls for a giant hunk of meat. 

In fact, I will call for a giant hunk of meat right now. 

\"Meat?\" \"Meat!\" \"MMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT!!!!!!!\"

That's what dining at Morton's is like. An unabashed opportunity to set loose your inner carnivore, in hopes of decimating some hapless steer that wandered too close to the stun gun. 

Portions are huge. Rational people would share the rib or fillet one per table. I see the place as a challenge to my very manhood; a bloody gauntlet thrown to the floor, then picked up and used to wipe away the Meat-Sweat to follow. 

Beware, the wait staff are worse enablers than family members who crash the Pasadena Recovery Centre on \"Celebrity Rehab\". 

They ply you with expensive liquor, and set before you a whole onion bread and slab of butter. You attack the bread with a viciously serrated wood-handled knife, and slather it with animal fat (i.e. butter). You wolf it down before the waiter, now smirking, comes back to take your order. You barely look up from the oniony, poppy-seedsed crumbs, wipe the butter from your jowls and command the onion soup, the platter of hot seafoods, or if you want to be laughed at, a salad. 

The onion soup is a flaming cauldron of cheese set atop a thick crouton. It's pleasant, but oddly light-one suspects it's made with chicken stock (which is odd, considering the sheer number of beef carcasses that must roll through the place). The onions are also slightly underdone. The cheese is well-blistered, but the whole thing feels half-baked. 

The hot seafood platter is better executed, but shared between two people it only serves to whet the appetite. Oysters rockefeller are the highlight, mainly because of the creamed spinach involved. I loves me some creamed spinach. 

Enough of this silliness, you want to say. BRING ME MEAT!!!

And they do; massive cuts of cornfed US Prime, which blows its pale Alberta cousins out of the pasture. This is manly beef. The kind of beef that, were it to encounter you on a beach, clad in its fashionable speedos, with a large-uddered cow on it's arm, would kick sand in your face with its dainty hooves. It is a beefgasm. 

Sides would be a waste of belly space, if they weren't so good. Giant tempura onion rings are a meal in themselves. Cottage fried potatoes lie somewhere between mythic hashbrowns and Rosti's butch cousin from the wrong side of the tracks. Fat and juicy asparagus benefit from an application of hollandaise (because God knows you need more fat in this meal). Creamed spinach deserves it's own restaurant, it's that damn good. Vibrant green, freshly chopped and laden with garlic, I praise it. 

If you have room for dessert or coffee--no, if you can finish your plate, you must have a tapeworm. Go to the doctor. Now."}
{"text":"It was late at night and we got a corner table.  Service was excellent.  Very professional and attentive. 

My customers ordered a cut prime rib and it was undoubtedly the biggest piece of flesh I have ever seen served.  I had the Filet minion which was seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Morton's is probably one of my other favourite steakhouse apart from house of Chen. I have been here a couple of times. Each time the steak and how its cooked, doesn't disappoint. Whether its the Morton's in Toronto or in Chicago (after all its where it all started).. it lives to its reputation of being a steakhouse.
I always have the smallest 6 oz steak cooked medium rare. They also have a vast and good selection of wine list. 

However if you're looking for a place to converse and talk. This is definitely not the place. Its a busy restaurant especially weekend, so it tends to get noisy with chitter chatter all around you.

The only disappointment which I had was I had a look into the menu on their website and also saw a banner which advertised a lobster tail along with a steak with some mash on as sides. But when I arrived and asked to order what I had seen on the website menu and banner, it wasn't available. Being told by the waiter that it was something which they will only carry during Mother's Day. Disappointment filled me quickly.

To end the night, the historical Molton Lava chocolate cake was ordered. It required a wait of at least 20 minutes, so don't order this if you're on a time crunch. But the wait time actually gave the meal sometime to digest. Rich and warm, the chocolate made a good combination with the vanilla ice-cream.

Nothing much has changed since the last time I paid a visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Morton's has a fine reputation, and for the most part it lives up to it. The Steaks are sublime, though I wasn't as keen on the asparagus or potatoes here... I am not sure their prices are always in line.

The drinks are all top shelf and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I really don't see the big deal about this place.  I ordered my first $47.00 fillet mignon and I was eager to see if it really was that much better than what you would get at Outback Steakhouse.  It was  better but not proportionately better than what you would pay at Outback.  We had a 9:00PM reservation and they told us to wait in the bar and they would come and get us when the table was ready.  We waited about 15 minuets and saw tables empty and then we went and asked if our table ready.  So I think they forgot about us.  We ordered the chopped salad for $10.00 and it was nothing special, my wife ordered the salmon which was not as good as I could cook on the grill at home.  The New York Cheesecake for desert was no better than anything I would buy in a grocery store.  I guess if I am going to drop $150.00 for dinner I expect outstanding food and service.  Neither of which I think we received.  Next time I want a good steak I think we will save about $80.00 and go to Outback and probably leave more satisfied."}
{"text":"I used to really like Morton's but the experience with the redesign of the restaurant  and food quality has really gone down hill. Recently I went for restaurant week and got the VIP special. I asked for the steak to be upgraded to the Cajun rib eye.  Now I don't mind paying a $15-20 up charge but the manager came back with an up with a $40 up charge. This is ridiculous, the steak that came with the meal is $42 and the Cajun rib eye is $52- how do you come up with a $40 difference. But this is just another example of this restaurant going down the drain. The steaks aren't as good as they used to be, not as succulent and now grisley and it's a crap shot if they are prepared correctly anymore- big difference between medium rare and a steak that arrives gray all the way through. The Shrimp Alexander isn't anything like it used to be, the shrimp tastes old and are tough and stringy and the sides lack flavor. I really think this Scottsdale Morton's will be going the same way as the one on Camelback did. I guess it's Dominick's from now on."}
{"text":"Great meal and excellent service. Definitely worth leaving the Strip and getting away from the tourist traps.  Gotta try the Cajun ribeye."}
{"text":"High level of service and high quality of steak. Price is worthy. U can enjoy the best steaks in toronto. However?the catogries of dishes are not enough. After or before eating steak?customers may want something for appetite. Not everybody wants lobster or hot chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Buzzcation was the event this time. A gathering of folks to eat some yummy food, drink a good martini or beer and support Packages from Home a worthy charity that sends packages to our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.
There were two main appetizers served. The first was an incredibly delicious salmon pizza. Fresh salmon served on pizza dough. Garnished just right, this was amazing.
Not to be out done, the second app was my favorite and I almost took the whole plate full. A crab BLT cake sandwich. A nice sized crab cake, on a mini hamburger bun, with lettuce, tomato and bacon. Oh my, oh my..this was amazing! Both of these items are future new pieces to the other great appetizers served at Morton's. The martini I had to go with was also well made. The staff from the bartender to waiter to hostess were all awesome. One day I will need to come back and have one of their steaks!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different Morton's before and I've got to say this is probably the worst one. We went here for new years, my wife's filet wasn't cooked right and mine was over done. They sent it back and it came back acceptable, but what really bothered us was some supposedly famous person was being extremely loud and annoying. It got so bad that we had to move to another table, the waiter mentioned that they couldn't ask him to leave because he was a personal friend of the owner. Well he ended up fighting with several other guests whom all ended up leaving."}
{"text":"The rib eye steak was amazing! The best steak I have ever had in my life. I went with my mom for a special mother daughter night and they made our night feel amazing. 

The service was impeccable. Our waiter was great and I never had to ask for a refill of water. 

If you are looking for a nice night out, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I love Morton's! Every time I go, I order off the menu. It is $120 for two people: each person gets a salad, filet with a seafood side, a vegetable side, and a dessert. That is a super great value if you think about the fact that a regular filet costs around $48 a la carte.

If you are going to order dessert, you cannot leave without getting the lava cake and the crème brûlée! I actually eat only have of my filet to make sure I have room for dessert. It is simply the best! If I didn't care about my figure, I would eat it all the time."}
{"text":"If you can afford to eat here, do it. And I say that in a \"I can't afford to eat anywhere other than Shoeless Joe's\" way, because really, it's not like it's THAT outrageous. A decent size steak will run you about $50 here, and you can order your sides a-la-cart. Unless you have a truly mammoth appetite, you don't need much more than their \"light\" size ribeye and a salad, or a side of the delicious sauteed mushrooms or asparagus. 

The steak is melty-in-your-mouth delicious. It's the kind of place that just makes me rejoice in being a meat eater. The first bite is a religious experience, and I tell myself it's good for me. I'm warding off anemia! At least I'm not eating my weight in pie! Could be worse! 

If you can afford to pair your steak with a delicious red wine, do that, too. Or better yet, go with someone who can afford to not spend the whole time thinking about what they can afford and you'll have a truly amazing steak experience. 

As for the stars, I give it four because I am young, have many steaks and steak places to try yet and I don't really feel comfortable declaring anything as \"best of the best\" ... but I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed with your meal here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, Amazing food. Doesn't get better then that."}
{"text":"This place really is as good as it gets.  I made it a point to visit all the top steak houses in Charlotte and Morton's holds the title and reigns supreme!

This was the first steakhouse I went to and I will have to rank them in the following order:

1 - Morton's
2 - Del Frisco's 
2 - Sullivans
3 - Ruth's Chris
4 - Capital Grille

Why is it number 1?  First off the steak.  Fillet Mignon was to die for, literally.  Ok not literally but it was by far the most flavorful steak I've ever had.  I love rare steaks and this was cooked absolutely perfect.  The sides were delish as well but the steak the steak THE STEAK is amazing!

I would say the service is better than the food, but it can't get better.  The service is top notch seriously, our waiter joked with us and managed to be completely professional at the same time.  The manager also talked with our group for a while as well.  Hell even the valet guys were cool.  

Then after dinner and drinks they took a group picture and gave each of us a copy, for free!  In the steakhouses in Vegas I frequent they always charge $20 to $30 a copy, so that was icing on the cake to me.

The layout is pretty nice and classy.  Tables are spaced well apart and not cramped at all.  There is an upstairs that overlooks the downstairs dining room, nice for a party.  The bar is all dark wood and to me is straight from the 20's.  You don't find too many classy bars like this anymore.  This place is classy, well appointed, and comfortable.  

You dont get the snobby feel that \"some\" of the nicer restaurants give off either.

Hands down, best Steakhouse in CLT!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the overall a 4 but if I had to rate just the steaks it'd be closer to a 3. Went in for dinner Saturday night and was seated immediately thanks to making a reservation. Our server was very nice and she explained everything on the menu as well as various cocktails and was great with refills, clearing dirty plates and silverware and making recommendations. She was absolutely 5 star. Ended up ordering bacon wrapped scallops, caesar salad, asparagus, lobster tail, lobster mac and cheese, filet mignon, a 20oz Morton's steak (I forget the cut), creme brulee and their lava cake. The scallops, lobster and salad were all excellent. The scallops and lobster were honestly some of the best I've ever had. The filet and 20oz steak were both ok. Certainly nothing to say \"the best steak anywhere\". The mac and cheese was pretty good. The asparagus was just bad. The desserts were decent, but honestly, nothing special. While it was a pretty sizeable meal and impossible to finish, it was also very overpriced. I don't mind an expensive meal but when your specialty is steak, it should be awesome steak and not comparable to what you'll get at Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"We went here for a date night.  It was disappointing how crowded the tables were. When we are going to be spending a lot of money on dinner, we would expect to be a little farther away from other people. 
The bread they give you before your meal is a big onion roll.  It has dehydrated onion pieces browned on top. They serve it with a pretty piped ruffle of whipped butter.
The steak was nothing special. The portions are far to big for me so I did not order a steak. My boyfriend got the new york strip and I just had a few bites of his ( we didn't finish the steak between the two of us).  It was ok, I was hoping that it would be similar to Mastro's since they are both part of Landry's, it was not nearly as good though.  
I got the truffle mashed cauliflower and the Bacon onion mac and cheese.  I was disappointed in the mac. ( For one the server told us they use powered onion in it- How gross and cheap of them.) It also just tasted like bar food. The sauce was gritty and very orange and not a lot of flavor. The bacon pieces were very crisp though, so that was good. 
The mashed truffle cauliflower was alright, other than the crusted Parmesan pieces on top it didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  Truffle is usually pretty overpowering.   It was good when mixed with all of the juices from the steak though. 
They had a classic dessert menu,  souffles, chocolate cake, cheese cake, berries and cream etc. 
I do not like chocolate or cheesecake though so we opted to go elsewhere for dessert. 
We probably will not go back here, it definitely was not worth the money or the drive. There are several other places that offer much better food and experience."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in the world!  They are expensive but believe me it is worth it! Btw, I didnt pay my date did!  The decor is pretty so dress up!  The bread was yummy and the Porterhouse steak was very tender and juicy! Dont miss out!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Absolutely delicious. Morton's is now just barely a few points behind my favorite high-end steak chain, Ruth's Chris.

We came by for my buddy's big 4-OH NO!!! excellent choice for such a grand occassion. located Off Strip, but not too far, this spot is easily accessible. we were actually pretty glad to find out it was a stand alone spot so we didn't have to mess around with all the rigamarole of walking through casinos. 

Very classy looking steakhouse. clean and modern but still sensible to all that a steakhouse is. after starting off with an old fashioned and a beer at the bar, we headed off to our table. table side bread and butter started us off by our friendly server. then a dozen oysters for our group of 7. i hate to be cliche and all, but, those oysters tasted sooooo \"fresh\". surprising since we're out in the middle of the desert. 

the menu was classic high-end steak house. the steaks ranged from high $30s to triple digit $$$. poultry and seafood were also offered. side items were obviously charged separate. the potates and veggies ranged from $8 to $20. they also offered surf and turf combo specials for $50. not bad for this place. oh, and we got a couple bottles of J Lohr Cab for the table. don't ask how much these $18 bottles cost at this spot. 

I ordered the 22oz Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye for $57, medium. Mama ended up having the Salmon and Shrimp. mama did give me some of her seafood, but, i couldn't honestly tell you how it was since all i CAN remember was my beautiful steak. oh, my beautiful steak.... (pause to reflect) 

juicy. tender. flavorful. buttery. rich. heavenly. scrumptious. foodgasmic. nom nom.

i'm out of words to describe it. i'm not going to try. you have to get your own and then break out the thesaurus. 

we closed off with the obligatory and apparently famous, Mortons' Molton Lava Cake and Ice Cream. man. can i re-use those adjectives for that? not a good thing to have to split two servings of that between a chocolate whore (me) and everyone else. excellent way to finish dinner. 

the meal was just amazing. the company even more so. if we have a chance and/or resources to drop a couple (or three) benjamins for a dinner in Vegas again, we may just return."}
{"text":"Great service from start to finish. Staff was knowledgable about the wine, menus and specials. They were helpful in advising on how much food to order for our group. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Waitress: Pam

Arrived for 7:30 reservation and was seated immediately (I requested a booth and the gentleman seating me pulled out the table for me sit.  Very nice touch!).  Ordered a glass of Markham Sauvignon Blanc.  Very nice, light flavorful taste.  Ordered Prime Pork Chop, Lyonnaise Potatoes (no pepper) & Asparagus.   

Bread arrived very quickly, and very hot, like it just came out of the oven.  Needed a knife & folk to cut. Butter melted quickly. Light toasted garlic taste.  Meal arrived 15 mins later. Pork Chop was steaming hot off the grill, cooked all the way through (with butterfly cut).  You can taste the charbroil/grill flavor.  Very good!! The jumbo asparagus was great, not over cooked.  Added some salt.  And the Lyonnaise potatoes were a little bland (most likely from asking for no pepper, but I added salt) and served with cooked onions.  Would have liked some parsley or some herbs added to the potatoes maybe?  But overall very pleased.  And the waitress checked on me 5 mins after meal arrived.  Very attentive.  

Lastly, I ordered the creme brûlée (with strawberry instead of raspberry).  Arrived within 3 mins.  Had a nice hard texture on top, but the actual cream inside could have set a little thicker (it was borderline runny).  

Side note: My waitress was very \"orderly\", she made sure my fork/spoon was readily available once my food arrived, and she swept the crumbs off the table.  Showed she is polished and cares, and she was friendly.  Very pleasant.  

Pro Tip: prior to my reservation, I joined the Landry's Club ($25 one time fee, no annual subscription cost), and upon signing up, they give you a $25 credit.  The points were applied to my bill during my visit at Morton's.  So it paid for itself.  Highly recommended.

{"text":"The last time I ate at a Morton's was in Houston, TX, so I was very excited when BJ suggested that we dine here Saturday night. Had a 7:30 pm reservation, was greeted promptly and led to a comfy corner booth. The restaurant was very busy. Our server Georgeann was very friendly and hit it off right away with BJ. The two of them kept me entertained all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. Well, BJ wins hands down. 

We pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited selection) and I am more of a cocktail girl. Loved the cosmopolitans there. Very delicious. 

We bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. 

We could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. 

Great place for a special occasion. We had a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I love a good steak, which I did have my first visit here but this visit was just awful. 

I took my hubby here for a Father's Day dinner, I feel so bad I definitely have to take him somewhere else.

The bread didn't seem fresh it was dry with an intense dry onion rub. Salads were ok, probably my favorite part of the meal actually. The steak I ordered medium due to being pregnant but it was rare, he got his medium as well and was actually done medium. My baked potato side was pretty good, it's hard to mess up microwaving a potato. His side of Mac and cheese was laughable. We were warned numerous times how hot the bowl was it came in but the actual dish was cold, cheese was hard, boxed Mac and cheese would have been so much better. The desserts I can't really say anything about I'm not much of a sweets person.

Staff was pretty attentive, you literally take one sip of water and they refill it. I guess I should complain about the service but it ruined the meal having them step in between us 20-30 times. I had to laugh when the one refill splashed my husband in the face mid sentence.

Definitely won't be back, too many other good options that don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Normally...I find that a waiter usually can jump a restaurants rating by a star with excellent service,recommendations etc. In this rare case...our waiter lowered my rating by a star. our waiter was very nice....truly over the top friendly on a recent slow evening. dying to please..in your face friendly. make sense? where are you guys from? where are you staying etc. way too much. Food was typically mortons quality although my center cut rib eye  was way too thick and somewhat chewy. My wife enjoyed her 6 oz. petite filet.....my son said his bone in ribeye was very good. drinks were fine..sides like the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were all good....but our lonely bored waiter gave me a headache."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food, ok service. Beautiful restaurant in an awesome location. The food is typical steakhouse but I'm not complaining it's always delicious! The service has never been bad but not really memorable either. Recommend for dates, or small to medium groups."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers for dinner once. Had their filet mignon and scallops surf and turf. They had good sides to pair with the meal and overall provided amazing service and the restaurant just provided a good atmosphere for people to wind down from a busy day at the office.  My team brought their own wine and paid a corking fee but they also have a good selection of drinks for you to choose from also."}
{"text":"The older lady Bartender....I think her name was Chris should retire. She never said hello, welcome to Morton's or I will be right with you. Hahahahaha. Maybe cause she was busy looking at a sheet of paper on how to make a certain cocktail The personality of a doormat. Crappy attitude .Even the guy next to me was scared to ask if she would put on the basketball game. Food was great. The manager was cool.  Run the other way if you see this lady there. You will know who she is. Trust me"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: The filet mignon was A-OK but everything else was pretty 'meh'.

It's hard for me to get excited about steak houses when an excellent butcher and a barbecue/cast iron pan will get you the same results. I also become resentful when sides cost more for the same fine piece of meat you can purchase from the butcher!

I ordered their FILET MIGNON which came with ALEXANDER SHRIMPS. Both very good. The steak was nice and blue and not a second overcooked. I liked that they kept it simple and didn't over spice it or drown it in gravy (god forbid!). The shrimps were big and juicy. Expectations, met!

The rest of the meal, however, was pretty disappointing. The MORTON'S SALAD (roughly cut up lettuce with bits of blue cheese) was pretty forgettable, the SOUR CREAM MASHED POTATOES was ultra bland, the veggies were standard, and the  DOUBLE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE tasted like packaged goods. My DCs commented that their KEY LIME PIE was too sweet.

As with many steak houses, I'm perpetually reminded that it's almost always better to do it yourself. Morton's is no exception."}
{"text":"We were celebrating 2 birthdays and this was the perfect place. Our server was Diane who was great. In fact, everyone on the staff could not be more attentive or considerate. The food was delicious. We both had melt in your mouths filets, prosciutto wrapped fresh mozzarella, Caesar salad sans the anchovies, horseradish whipped potatoes and cream corn. All were excellent. For dessert the hot chocolate cake was great as was the bread pudding. Bar service was great and their selection and assortment is wonderful. If you have an occasion to celebrate or simply want a fine meal and don't mind spending some $$$. You will not be disappointed with Morton's."}
{"text":"Been here about 6-8 times and have never been disappointed. Steaks are to-die-for and wine selection is very nice.

The used to have a cigar lounge inside the place, but they took it out unfortunately.

Make sure you order the Grand Marnier souffle too. WOW. Makes your mouth water."}
{"text":"Such a great steakhouse! I could not have been more impressed with the experience. 

It started with a knowledgeable bartender that put together a refreshing gin mixed drink and a solid gin martini (I always recommend Hendricks).  

For dinner, started with the oysters which were very good. For dinner I got the double cut bone in fillet. Talk about an amazing flavor! I really appreciated being able to see an example the cut prior to cooking the meat, very nice touch. 

For dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake, which was delicious. The server was nice enough to give us a free VIP after dinner cocktail. 

I will be going back."}
{"text":"Pass on this place. To start in an empty shopping center they charge you 7 dollars to valet your car....At these prices and with the many choices of places to go it should be free.  We got our dinner and the waiter told us as well as the busboy that the steaks are pre-weighed and packaged at their out of state facility.  Again at these prices the steak should be aged in house and cut to order. We come from back east and all good steak houses do that. It was a huge disappointment.  When we complained about the service, steak and valet the manager said he was sorry and that he would like to offer us another meal but he would have to check with his district manager.  That was over 4 weeks ago.  POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  What manager does not have the discretion to satisfy his customers.  There are too many steak houses in town to be treated like this.    lee w  Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Perfect for date night! Porterhouse steak is perfect for two. Asparagus is good, mashed potatoes are good. Service was great. I recommend for anyone for a special night."}
{"text":"Upscale Chain with Straightforward Fare

We visited for restaurant week, which was a nice experience for a reasonable price. I ordered the lobster bisque, filet minion with broccoli, and chocolate mousse. The menu is very standard, but Morton's does its staples well. The steak was yummy, and I liked the lobster bisque. The broccoli had little flavor, but it was the healthy option. The chocolate mousse is killer! Excellent service, all the staff was friendly and professional, and our waitress was timely. Overall a nice time"}
{"text":"I've been to Morton's many times, and loved it.  However, this time, it was a disappointment.

We weren't seated, until 30 minutes after our reservation.  There were about three different parties, in our situation.  The hostess was absolutely no help.  She never explained there would be delay, nor how long it may be for, and she answered any inquiries by scowling and speaking sharply, to everyone.

If she had simply said they were running late, apologized, and said the wait would be X minutes, it would have made a huge difference.

During the meal, our second side dish arrived halfway into eating.  My friend ordered the mix grill. The outside of his meat was dry.  I tried the Manhattan bone-in.  It was merely...ok (which is the first time I've said that about a steak at \"Morton's\"!).  It lacked flavour.

On the plus side, our server was very friendly, and the macaroni and cheese was delicious, as always."}
{"text":"It is hard to go wrong with Mortons! I've been a Mortons customer off and on for years and have never had a bad experience.  

I like the fact this particular restaurant is just off the strip. We have never had trouble getting in, even without reservations.  As a Vegas local, I have probably been there 4-5x in the past year mostly special occasions like birthdays, family celebrations, valentines day, etc. A few times we went to other restaurants but had issues that caused us to change our minds upon arrival such as table issues, customer service, etc. When in doubt or in a jam we always go back to Mortons. 

The staff is very friendly and shows real quality customer service. It is a very classy romantic feel in the restaurant. Everytime I have been there I have felt important and welcome. I love the fact they even take a picture at your table for you, and give it to you to preserve the memory.  Its a nice personalized touch. 

It is hard to find something bad on the menu. The oysters are great, the seafood ocean sampler platter is off the hook a mix of scallops wrapped in bacon, oysters rockefeller, stuffed shrimp and crab cakes.  The Bone in Rib Eye cooked medium is still one of the best steaks I have ever had. Any dish with the shrimp/pasta is great also.  

No doubt I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times, the one constant is the service is always top notch, the team does a great job, however we recently have seen the food quality start to decline.  So you may ask, then why the 5 stars? On this visit, I felt like I was back at the Mortons we had known from a few years ago and along with the continued great service, just a awesome dining experience.

Today's visit was to celebrate my wife's birthday, as Laundry members, for birthday's, the company gives a $25 credit, pair that with a Lobster special and being restaurant week and we couldn't resist. 

Food quality - My wife ordered from the restaurant week prefix and I reserved a lobster. As always we started with a appetizer of the short rib tacos. The taco's were amazing, meat cooked perfect, the sauce was on point. My wife ordered the 8 out filet, again was cooked as ordered. I had the lobster. Now I know it was good but what sealed it was my wife, who doesn't usually like shell fish, kept picking at my lobster which was a key indication that the meal was made perfect. 

Service - No matter what, the team is always taking care of the guests and I have never had a bad experience at any Mortons I have visited. Luke and the team continued that tradition with great service. The team worked very well together, not once was our drink glasses empty, or did we want for anything, and the restaurant was busy so no one was standing around. 

In conclusion, I was very happy that we dined here today and do defiantly think the quality of food is where you would expect from a steakhouse in Vegas in where every casino seems to have a advertised high end steakhouse, so there is more competition than in other cities. This location did a great job and look forward to our next return."}
{"text":"If you love chocolate mousse you need to check out Morton's.  Generally most restaurants don't offer authentic chocolate mousse this mousse is so good got me thinking about going back for another hehe.  The consistency is light and fluffy.  Each bite was delicious and the whipped cream definitely accommodated the mousse such perfect balance ... Love!!!  The customer service is excellent and cordial.  The manager even called the next day to say thanks for dropping by."}
{"text":"Came back to Morton's and was happy to find not much has changed. 

Food is still amazing. 
Service relatively fast. 
Ambiance remains intimate and cozy

Just had to...

RECOMMEND- Le filet mignon (with black truffle butter in my case)

EXTRA TIP- if you like full bodies reds, pair the above with the \"rare red\" Cabernet that's got a chocolatey truffle undertone. Available by the glass at this time. 
Heaven!"}
{"text":"Julio is amazing. He checks up on you, keeps the drinks filled..and suggest the most amazing entrées. Also he really knows his wines. If you're in the area looking for an amazing dinner and a memorable night ask for Julio!!!! CHEERS"}
{"text":"I was contacted by Morton's manager Josh today regarding the experience related in my last review, when their establishment closed earlier than posted.  He assures that this was a very VERY rare instance and that restaurant hours normally keep to schedule. He expressed regret for the inconvenience and mentioned January may have had only one or two instances of early closure, something that may at times be due to inclement weather/very slow business.

Five stars to management that keeps a pulse check on their business, no matter the great or small an issue. I'm very appreciative that they took the time to make contact, as it shows great customer awareness and care.

I'm sure to review the restaurant/bar itself soon as I work nearby. Three even keeled stars for now (good) as I've yet to dine here. I look forward to Morton's Cleveland, as I've enjoyed their Tampa and Reston locations for delicious steaks.. medium rawr. No, that's not a typo.

Thumbs up,  management!"}
{"text":"Normally most Morton's are pretty solid.  This place not so much.  I should probably start with the horrible sulfur smell as soon as you walk in. The manager said it's the stripe mall behind them that's to blame. Even if that's the case they ought to figure out a way to keep it out of their restaurant. 

The one manger that served our wine just doesn't understand customer service.  My wine glass had cork pieces in it and another two had debris in them.  Instead of apologizing and replacing all three glasses he said he'd use a filter.  Well...that didn't work either.  He then handed me the wine list and said choose something else.  No offer to open a new bottles, comp a glass of wine, etc....I wasn't looking for free wine but after several issues the right thing to do would have been to comp a glass a wine or something. 

I ended up not even ordering wine with my horrible steak.  Probably one of the worst steaks I've had in a long time.  I couldn't even eat it.  The waitress knew it wasn't good but didn't do anything.  It was clear she was new.  As the check was coming the manager came to our table with two bottles of wine and asked if I'd like to try one.  It was way to late for late. He should have done that as the problems were unfolding.  He should have also notice the 6 oz filet that was left on my plate (ordered 8 oz filet).

Anyway, I could go on and on about how bad my experience was at this location but it's not worth it.  So many better steakhouses in Vegas that will get my business going forward."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Morton's before in several other cities. It's a chain. Way better than Ruth's Chris, but worse than many other similarly priced steakhouses.

My expectations were thus set relatively low when I came to the Toronto location. But they really did everything right here. Big chunks of crab in the crab cocktail, creamy mac n cheese, good (and perfectly cooked) steaks, service is down-to-earth (glad they did away with the stupid canned bit where they roll out the meat cart) and the whole atmosphere is very comfortable. Not sure how someone can call it \"stuffy\"; it's completely the opposite. This is where I want to go if I'm tired and hungry.

They're not reinventing the wheel here, but it's inoffensive and safe. Sometimes that's what you need."}
{"text":"I have been racking my brain to think of nice things to say about Morton's:

* They plastic wrap they use on the \"selection tray\" is very shiny:)

* They have single malt scotch:)

* The lighting is very low if you have light sensitivity problems:)

* The steaks are better than the steaks at Lonestar or Outback or the buffet at Eagles Nest in the casino:)

I want to say something nice, because that's how I was raised.

But I'm having trouble.

Was the food really bad?...Well, no it wasn't a horror show...although medium rare isn't that hard to achieve...I shouldn't have to put up with an over cooked steak (I don't like to send food back when dining with clients...doesn't send the right message)

Was the service inept or ill-mannered?...Not really, although being asked if everything is \"to my liking\" after every third bite can become cloying (I suppose it's in the manual somewhere:)

Was the bill really that bad?...Well, my prospective clients actually took me to dinner, so I didn't pay, but I did see the bill...$460 for the three of us, so not as much as some but for that kind of dough I do expect a better meal:)

Morton's seem to have become the McDonald's of steakhouses (as contrasted with Ruth's Chris...the Burger King of steakhouses:)

They are safe...

You won't get the wildly uneven results that you'll find with say...a Mastro's location:)

You always know where the toilet is:)...and the bar:)...and the coat room:)...and etc.:)

You always know where the rib-eye is located on the \"selection tray\":)

But the preparation of the food is pedestrian, the presentation is uninspired, the sides are uninspiring and the whole feel is formulaic and dated:(

I do expect more at this price point and Morton's just doesn't deliver these days:(

So, just like MickieD's, I only go to Morton's these days, when I am dragged (or is it \"drugged\":)

Are there worse dining experiences?...oh you bet...we could still be dealing with The Pink Taco:)"}
{"text":"The night was simply amazing! The 6oz filet mignon was so tender, juicy and seasoned until perfection. The side dishes such as mashed potato and garlic green beans were also done great. The garlic green beans were little soft for my taste, but still very flavorful. The salmon was little fishy and slightly dry but it still tasted amazing. The chocolate mousse for desert was absolutely astounding, not too sweet, but light and dreamy. The price was little overpriced, but with the fantastic services, it was all worth it!"}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience celebrating a birthday with our group of 8. As expected, the restaurant has a cozy and fine dining ambiance with romantic lighting. The location is easily accessible from the strip so it's not so long to get to. 
I've been to many steakhouse and restaurants in Vegas and going to Morton's was a nice change of pace. There wasn't much that completely made the experience unique from the others, but overall, we had a great time. 
House cabernet was excellent, salad and sides were very well portioned (we had so many including different mashed potatoes, lobster Mac, and veggie plates) and all were delicious.  Shrimp cocktail had great presentation but wasn't the best I've had. Most of us ordered a filet mignon or the ribeye. Well cooked!! That's definitely important. You may choose to add a topping like butter if that's your thing. 
We were so full so shared the cheesecake and the birthday boy got his own cake and candle. We were all able to get a group photo of us and the service throughout the evening was outstanding. 
The only thing that was slightly off was seeing a charging cable attached to the wall of the entrance as we walked into the restaurant. Not so classy but an easy fix. ;)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for restaurant week. Food was ok nothing spectacular. We ordered the filet mignon and double cut pork chop. Pork chop was a little under done and the filet was delicious. For dessert we ordered the key lime pie and creme brûlée which were very good. If it wasn't for our waitress I probably would have given 2 stars."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is better than Ruth's Chris except for the steak!  Its still good..just not as good.  But the atmosphere, service, sides, desserts..all better!  And how can you pass up on the happy hour with filet mignon burgers???"}
{"text":"Service is good. Steak meat quality is very low quality. Went there on my birthday in December and for Easter and both times they over cooked the steak. You're a steakhouse and wondering why you cannot compete with strip steakhouses. What tourist is going to go drive here for a $66 bone in ribeye that is well over cooked and bad quality. Sent it back to have a new one prepared and they did the same thing again. The horseradish mashed potatoes had no flavoring to them. The shrimp cocktail was great though. 6 people at for $660 and we're very disappointed. I will be happy to see this place close just like Roy's up the street that is now Lotus of Siam and a far better option."}
{"text":"Poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality. Nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive. I would recommend Capital Grille over Morton's."}
{"text":"We had a long week at the CES show in Vegas.  We celebrated our hard work by having 11 of us dinning in the private room.  We first went to the bar waiting for everyone to arrive.  I had to reorder two drinks as they didn't taste right.  Once seated, we had a great time sharing the plates of the various appetizers.  I ordered the 16 Oz. Australian lobster tail and it was amazing.  It was literally the best that I've eaten in my life.  I highly recommend trying it.  We had great service and the food was prepared perfectly.  The only downside I would say was the alcohol.  I ordered a long island and I never had a buzz.  It had been clearly watered down.  Overall it was a great meal and service."}
{"text":"This pains me to write, as I've always been a fan of the morton's in Scottsdale.  Sadly no more...I've ben here before, repeatedly, and have to report it is sliding downhill.  To be clear its simply not my observation, this Friday night at 9:30 there were ZERO customers, very unusual when across the parking lot the cheesecake factor had an hour wait for a table.  As for the food: the crab cakes were not the same, less breading, more filling, not as good.  we had 3 steamed lobsters, they were terrible, just sitting on a plate, not even slightly cracked.  The claw was raw, the body had this unusual black substance inside that none of us had ever seen...sad and disappointing.  I understand from a seemingly disgruntled employee that there are new owners who simply are interested in the financial bottom line.  They should really check out the food, as they too would see this is not good.  You can do better, in fact, it would be hard to do worse.

NOTE:  I subsequently learned that black insides of a lobster mean that it was previously frozen!  Now I know."}
{"text":"Great food as always. But something has changed under new management. Service feels more piecemeal and less upper crust. Hope the buy out hasn't made Morton's feel more like a chain and less like a class act"}
{"text":"While the food met expectations the quality of service was less than desirable. If I compare it to Ruth's Chris or The Palm I would say Morton's is a clear fourth. I have dined at a number of Morton's and this was by far the worst. To make matters worse the manager (grey suit) actually had an average ticket discussion with our waitress right next to our table. If this was Chili's I get it but not at a Morton's. Class was clearly missing from the environment. Again if you are just going for the food its a ok choice. If you are going for the food and experience I would suggest The Palm or Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"I think every waiter in Las Vegas went to some sort of customer service course, which are able to make sales with simply smiling and making over the top recommendations. I forgot our waiters name, but he was phenomenal. And the meals to die for. So tender, and juicy. Overall, amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday (6 of us total) so you can imagine the bill.  Great steaks and so forth, but I really think they go overboard on the appetizers...I mean seriously...And the cheesy waiter showing us different kinds of steaks and appetizers before we order...no on the menu guys, there is an actual waiter with actual (probably laminated) steaks so you can make your decision.  The restaurant itself was nice...dim, subtle.  Be prepared to spend though...."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner. It was very good, we left happy, only gave it 4 stars though because its really nothing special for the price.
The ambiance was nice. Very classy, not too noisy, open kitchen, yet not too snooty.
We started with the french onion and lobster bisque. Both were tasty but for 17$ and 13$ it was just soup. The bread was good, nice and crusty but soft in the center. My boyfriend got the porterhouse(65$) and i got the seafood combo with grilled shrimp, breaded shrimp, and a crab topped salmon (55$). We opted out of sides to save room for dessert. We both enjoyed our entrees (pretty much ate it all), he said the steak was good but just as good as a steak from Maggianos or even The Steakhouse at Circus Circus where its about 10-15$ less and comes with sides and a salad.  I don't eat red meat so everytime we go to a steakhouse i get a seafood dish. This one was one of the best I've had. I got a huge portion and it was extremely tasty. It had a nice lemon sauce and the salmon was cooked perfect. My food was actually incorrect when it came out, it had bacon wrapped scallops instead of the grilled shrimp that it was supposed to come with. I just told our waiter and it was fixed immediately. Not a big deal at all. For dessert, we chose the lava chocolate cake. For 15 dollars it was a dissappointment. It didn't taste bad but it wasn't special. The waiter told us all desserts were made in house but it seemed like any chocolate lava cake you could get at any casual dining restaurant. Nothing was wrong, service was good, food was good, we had a nice evening, but living in Vegas we could probably find a better place for a 250$ (with drinks) dinner. Not to mention a 20% tip. For 300$ we have had better experiences at places like Oscars in the Plaza or Twin Creeks at Silverton."}
{"text":"It was excellent right up until the waitress commented \"uh water only...uh hmmm\"  kinda insulting.  

the escargot was excellent, Caesar salad not great but huge, French onion soup cheese was not browned or crusty and broth...I've had better at the local pub. rack of lamb was spectacular. crispy edges tender and seasoned perfectly. forgot our asparagus in the kitchen. overall good meal...average quality meal when considering price"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here. I went last year and I thought the food was just \"okay\". However, this time I went, I was blown away! The food was EXCELLENT. Morton's is definitely overpriced, but their food and quality is amazing. Our server Lynn was wonderful. My only complaint (besides the cost) is the person who appeared to be the manager. He visited every table EXCEPT ours. It seems he only visited the tables with what he thought to be \"valuable customers\". The hostess was wonderful and as was our server. Usually the manager is supposed to give superior customer service, but this was not the case here."}
{"text":"We had a perfect dining experience!  Shrimp Alexander was so good.  Even though we don't come here often and have never been to this location before the prepartion of the shrimp is exactly how I remember it.  Our kids got the filets and they were cooked as requested.  The twice baked potatoes were almost too good loaded with cheese.  The creamed spinach was super good. We ALL loved the legendary sundae.  The service was great- our waitress was very attentive and helpful.  We had a great time."}
{"text":"Since my original review of the Scottadale Morton's I have been in touch with both corporate Morton's and the local restaurant. Morton's were very responsive and promises to \"make it right\". Very classy and appreciated by me. I'll definitely be back and can't wait to have another dinner there."}
{"text":"I came here for Valentine's Day and it was truly a memorable experience. The service was exceptional. Our server was amazing, she was sweet, informative and very attentive. Morton's had in fact even called us earlier upon our arrival to let us know that it was a little colder than usual because of the weather and to dress appropriately! Definitely a sweet gesture! 

The food was delicious! We loved our steaks - it was cooked perfectly to our liking. My husband added the Oscar and it was a great add on to his steak. We also got the Parmesan frites and it was so delicious! We got the creme brûlée for dessert and it was so delicious! The perfect amount of sweetness. Overall, our experience here was amazing! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with my girlfriend and I was surprised their happy hours were from 5pm to close - EVERY DAY! 

The prices were a bit steep but what do you expect when you come to a lovely five star restaurant. Our bartender was really great (Cailey I believe) 

Weell definitely be back here for a late date night!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The appetizer of cold seafood was good, we ordered two of them and it could have had more that what came out, but was great! The onion soup was unbelievable!!! Best I have ever had. The Steaks were Cooked just like we all requested. Great flavor and juicy! The sides were great as well. The desert was good as well. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant probably the single most best steakhouse I've ever eaten at. Our waiter Andrew was excellent and the water guy never let the water get low. Of course he steak was perfect."}
{"text":"The bar and the general decor of the restaurant is really classy. The bar is of decent size - no trouble getting a bar seat or even a bar table at happy hour. 

The bartenders were efficient and the bartender made a really good and strong Manhattan. 

The food though is what drops the rating. We tried three of the items off the $8 food menu. The Four Petite Filet Mignon Sandwiches had good flavor owing to the sauce. The presentation of the four rectangular mini sandwiches was sad though. The buns were not nicely aligned, the greenery added no value and the visual of the meat implied it was the leftovers from another dish. Even if that was true, the presentation could have been greatly improved. 

The Three Prime Cheeseburgers were better, though three is a hard number of things to share with someone. Each mini slider was stacked tall with lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese. The sliders were served with generic mayo, mustard and ketchup. 

The Spinach, Crab & Artichoke Dip might have been my favorite. The dish was served with cheesy toast points. 

Other items on the Bar Bites menu sounded good, like the Mini Crab Cake BLTs, which the bartender recommended in addition to the Spinach & Artichoke Dip, but with the disappointing nature of the other dishes I'm not sure I'll be back to try it. 

Nothing was bad or improperly cooked, but the food served just isn't something I will get a taste for. There are more exciting happy hours in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I dragged my friend out to Morton's for their bar menu last Friday. I often miss out on happy hour deals due to my work schedule, so I was eager to check this happy hour out on my weekday off. To my surprise, Morton's offer their bar menu and drink specials from Open to Close Sunday to Friday!

They had a list of bar bites available for $8. We selected the Filet Trio & Crab Cake BLT sliders. We also each had a cocktail for $8.50 each - all & all make this a good bargain at one of the top restaurants in town.

Now - the reason for my 3-stars... I understand we were not spending big bucks, but the fact that we requested medium rare on the filet, it came out more like well done and the bartender simply said it was impossible to cook a small filet piece medium rare bothered me. I realize that the bar bite dish consisted of 3 small pieces of filet - but if it is a challenge to cook medium rare on that particular dish they should have said so when I made the request. I have issues with steakhouse not coming close to the temperature I requested, worse when they didn't even bother to pretend they cared. Good thing it was $8.

Overall the food was ok - the filet trio came with 3 different sauces and the blue cheese butter was the clear winner. The crab cake BLT was good as well. It is a good spot for a cheap bite at the bar."}
{"text":"So let me start of by saying I am a very tough critic but I had to give my experience 5 stars. To jump off the New Year , my girlfriend and I decided to start off with a great dinner .  So we went to dinner around 8 no reservation ; however I wouldn't suggest this on the weekend . Process was easy , we were quickly seated . We had an amazing server name Christian ( I think that was his name , wears glasses  ) Christian got us started with some yummy apps ! I always seem to get the Shrimp Alexander . My girlfriend got the Lobster Bisque before dinner . To my tasting the bisque was standard nothing too amazing .My girlfriend on the other hand had a hard time enjoying it and sent it back. I was a tad bit disturbed ( I hate sending food back ) but Christian just made us feel so comfortable about it . Dinner was amazing . I believe I had a mixed grill plate ehh , I believe cost was around $55. Salmon , 2 stuffed shrimp and 2 grill shrimp . The girlfriend had surf and turf . Meat came out perfect ! I basically swallowed my entire plate down in 0.3 seconds .  The Manager came over to introduce himself and to let us know of some water issue that was causing the restaurant to close down and 9:30. It really didn't seem like and issue being that I did swallow all my food down rather fast  . He apologized numerously and even compd our appetizers and dessert ! I was sold alone on his personality and concern for everyone in the restaurant having a wonderful experience . With the water line messing up we understood it was not the restaurants fault but it was nice to see the manager cared. Upon leaving , I gather my things to get the card for my valet and notice my car was already pulled up!!! The manager walked us out and had already timed the car to be brought up perfectly !!!! Whoa!!!! I am usually a Del Frisco girl but I really think Morton's stole me away !   I am already re thinking birthday dinners and other celebrations for Morton's instead of Del Frisco !"}
{"text":"We just had our 6 year anniversary there. We have eaten at some very good steak houses.  Morton's definitely is in the top 3.   They had menus with a anniversary greeting on the top.  They took a picture and printed it out in a paper frame, that was signed my all of the staff.  They made it a very special night.  

I had the Cajun Ribye.  This was the best marinated ribye that I have ever eaten in a restaurant.  The baked potato was delicious.  The bread was remarkable.  The fresh asparagus was a delicious creation with the hollandaise sauce.  

My guest had a double cut fillet and potatoes lyonnaise....he loved them both.  Then they gave us a free souffle for desert.  

The service was very good.  

I would recommend this for a special occasion.  Price is a little steep, but well worth what you are paying.  Cost us around $260 for two people.  That includes a $65 tip."}
{"text":"When you're in Pittsburgh, and you want to have a great dining experience, let me suggest Morton's!  I have had gone there for lunch on a few occasions, but dinner is a whole different experience!!!  Our waitress Kelly was great!  She provided us with great suggestions for wines to pair with our dinners, she kept great conversations with us, and made sure we enjoyed our evening.  Both my girlfriend and I had Filet Mignons.  I have had Filets in a lot of places, but I think this might have been the best ever!  I also had a Caeser Salad before, Steamed Broccoli with the meal, and the Double Chocolate Mousse after.  My girlfriend enjoyed the Tomato Salad before our meal, the Chicago Mashed Potatoes, and the Key Lime Pie for dessert.  Afterwards we finished our bottle of Spellbound Merlot, signed up for the Landry's Select Club and enjoyed the remainder of our evening!  Morton's has always been one of those places that I've kept in the back of my mind for a great meal, and tonight they have proven why they are the best!!!"}
{"text":"My table enjoyed our meal but we were really disappointed by the unacceptably long wait for drinks. We finished apps and our mains came still without our wine. We had to signal another waiter because ours disappeared and when the drinks finally came, we were almost finished eating. This was a really special occasion and, though we had a good time, we were displeased with the long wait and inattention."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to celebrate the end of his MBA program. He is a major steak lover and loves these kinds of places but neither of us had ever been. We had a reservation and were seated very promptly by the manager. The server also had a slip of paper with our last names and greeted us as such. We had two servers, Jane and I can't remember the guy's name. Jane had her spiel down (as I heard her repeat it to the table behind us) and was somewhat likeable. I found her off-putting at times such as when she acted caught off-guard when I ordered an appetizer as my dinner. Then she smiled at me in an all-knowing way as if I was one of \"those\" girls ordering something small for dinner. I didn't say anything but my husband caught on as he said something about it after she left the table. Then later I overheard her jokingly ask a gay male couple seated by us \"who is the Mrs?\" when presenting their bill. That rubbed me wrong way, too, but maybe I was being sensitive. 

Anyway, they brought a large warm onion loaf of bread. It was okay...I ate several pieces. For dinner, we had the clams casino appetizer ($12), for my meal I had the baked prime platter ($22), my husband had the cajun ribeye ($47), bacon and onion mac-n-cheese ($11) and parmesan truffle fries ($11). Everything was very good except the fries because they never brought it out! It was on the bill, though, so I am not sure what happened there. They took it off when we brought it to their attention. Oh, that reminds me, Jane and the other server apologized for the oversight but Jane took it one step further by saying that at least it wasn't her mistake. Tacky. 

My baked seafood platter consisted of one breaded large shrimp, one bacon wrapped scallop, one oysters rockerfeller, and one small lump crab cake. For $22????? Um okay....the horseradish sauce they gave with it was amazing though. My husband was in love with his steak. I had a bite, too, and it was really good. The mac-n-cheese was very cheesy and decadent. For dessert, we had the small chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream ($15). I'm not sure why Jane said it took a half hour to cook but either way, it was very delicious. 

Adding a couple glasses of wine (it took awhile for my husband to be asked if he liked a second glass of wine-after his first had been empty for at least 10 minutes),  our bill came to $150. I knew it would be expensive but didn't care because it was a gift to my husband. I just don't get places like this. The service wasn't better than other places (and in some instance, worse), and the food didn't wow me. My husband had a good point that it could be hard to do that with seafood. I tend to agree but at that price point and the amount of food, I should have loved it. Instead, it was comparable to places half the price. My husband will probably go back....but without me. Meh, not interested."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh foodies are SPOILED ROTTEN!!! This was the best Mortons I have ever been to in my life and its located in the heart of their downtown... South Florida (my home and the most conspicuously consumptive area in America) has a Mortons that these folks would turn their noses up at, as they booked the first flight home!!! The ambience here was chic and gorgeous while the service was heartfelt and top shelf... Our server, Jess, took her time with us and explained the menu like we were in kindergarten. She brought me the best five onion soup in the world and then blew me away with the spiciest cajun steak I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Dinner was so pleasant and wonderful that I had a food coma dream about buying property here and spending my days in the Carnegie museums and my nights at Mortons (I woke up screaming though, when I dreamt of wearing a Steelers jersey and rooting for the Pirates). The evening was complete when our busperson (who knew we were Hurricane Irma refugees) brought out a massive, piping hot loaf of onion bread for us to enjoy in the morning at our hotel room... Theres nothing like good ol' Pittsburgh hospitality (ITS NOT A CLICHE) and theres no better restaurant than Mortons!"}
{"text":"Terrible Value but the steaks were good.  $13 Caesar Salad with tasteless dressing that probably came out of a bottle.  $13 side dishes.  But the most crazy was $89 for a bottle of Acacia Pinot Noir that's $20 at the State Store.  A mark-up of 4 1/2 times retail.  Insane.  No other drinks.  No dessert or coffee.  So the bill for 2 salads, 2 steaks, 2 sides and a bottle of very average wine was $310.  Probably the worst value around."}
{"text":"Not a fan,  I have been to a majority of steak houses in Ohio and I was excited to give it a try.  We had a fairly large party and ordered a variety of from starters and we all had different entries.  I had the prime cut ribeye, medium rare,  the steak was tough with no flavor,  not even the basic salt and pepper.  The medium rare was more medium,  very little pink.  The side were okay and best,  mushrooms were tiny,  hash brown was just that a $14 hash brown and the others were the same,  very small individual portions vs portions for \"sharing\" as described in the menu.  I am glad I went with a group of friends instead of with a date, unfortunately I will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent cut and grade of meat (center cut filet). Appetizers and sides were mediocre. Bread was excellent. Dessert was great as well. Overall great experience. Servers were good."}
{"text":"I love this Morton's. .the staff is great and the food is amazing..the ribeye was great and scallops wrapped bacon amazing"}
{"text":"I thought it was a great dining experience.  The service was excellent.  The steaks were perfect, I had the scallops wrapped in bacon and they were the best I have ever had.   The chocolate lava cake was delightful.   This is the best steakhouse in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans, which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment \"Oh jeans I see...\" making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience. 

The drinks were average and the steaks were good, but not fabulous. In fairness, our waiter was very friendly, though.

Unfortunately, our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better, especially at a nice restaurant like this.

When people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner, you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Morton's for years. We love that you're able to smoke cigars on the patio. However, we came in for dinner the other night and we ordered medium-rare steaks that came out well. They happily made us new ones but mine came out very rare. We told our server and she showed the manager. Never once did the manager, Adam, come speak to us to ask how our dining experience was or apologize for the inaccurate steak temps. We got our side of potatoes comped for, even though the steaks were not done correctly twice! I would recommend not eating steaks here until the new chef figures out steak temps, and the manager can deliver excellent costumer service/experience, but if you're looking for a spot to smoke a cigar and enjoy a glass of wine the patio is great!"}
{"text":"There is nothing really to complain about here.  This Mortons is like most in other cities.  It's definitely for the expense account crowd.  It's fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  I've been to Mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  It's like most other high end chain steakhouses (Palm, Ruth's, Capital Grille, etc.).  The bar is pretty lame, but I'm guessing most go here for a sit down dinner.  Capital Grille or Hyde Park bar is much better for bar scene.  But, one thing I definitely appreciate about the bar is  the bar menu.  If you've never been to Mortons and you are watching your budget go to the bar have a cold beer and order the PRIME cheeseburger trio or the Filet sandwiches for only 6 DOLLARS.  Plus, the fries are awesome.  The dining room is really nice with dark wood and lots of leather.  The service is awesome because I'm guessing you have to be pretty good to land a server position that might end up paying you 6 figures.  The food is great.  However, my opinion is that most true high end steakhouses all have similiar quality steak.  I eat here a few times a year and my favorite first courses are the lobster bisque (Very good, but not as good as capital grille) and the tuna tartare.  Stay away from the filet.  I mean it's tender and delicious, but try a steak with a little flavor.  I'm guessing if you're like me you don't go to Mortons often, so try something that  is hard to get elsewhere.  Get the Cajun ribeye.  I can't remember if Pittsburgh location does a bone in ribeye, but if they do I would say a cajun bone in ribeye will be one of the best if not the best steaks you ever try.  I also suggest getting the \"lazy\" lobster.  There are few things in life more indulgent or enjoyable than having a two pound lobster cooked perfectly already cracked for you.  It's pure indulgence.  The asparagus is great and as big as a baseball bat.  The spinach is great and the hash browns are a must have.  You should definitely save room for desert and there is no better desert here than the chocolate souffle'.  Remember to tell them that is what you want for desert when you order your entrees.  I wish the bar was better, because if it was I'd go here more often.  This place is exactly what you would expect.  And, that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place only has 3 stars?  Everything was beyond fabulous!  Stage leap wine by the glass, jumbo shrimp were super fresh!!!  Tried the Cajun steak tonight it it was great, cooker perfect and great flavor!  Wife had the mixed grill, filet, shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops!   Service was 5 star and had the best booth in the house !"}
{"text":"5+ stars!  And this coming from a girl who \"does not\" eat steak!  The seafood is outstanding.  Shrimp Alexander is divine, Crab cakes are heavenly and the molten hot chocolate cake is to die for!!!
My husband thoroughly enjoys the steaks each and every time we go.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Went to Morton's because we had a $50.00 gift card and didn't think we would ever use it and with the excuse of Restaurant Week despite the mixed reviews decided to try it out. It was just okay, the bread, onion loaf was just a loaf of bread probably heated in a microwave because after the first slice it got a little stale. We ordered the 6oz filets they were tender and cooked just right but none of the side were very exciting. The Lyonnaise potatoes were tasty but very greasy, The broccoli might have been frozen broccoli and the Hollandaise was tasteless. The chopped spinach salad were good but cannot compare to the warmed spinach salad at Mastro's. Their only Riesling by the glass was not good quality for the price. For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle which was delicious but both of us couldn't detect any chocolatiness in it. I actually asked \"is this the chocolate souffle?\" Our waitress was great, we can't complain at all about the service but we have definitely been to better steakhouses. We don't plan to return."}
{"text":"Can't complain about the best steak, service and appetizers in town."}
{"text":"Perfect steaks at an old school steak house . That's how I would define mortons. We usually don't go here, but when we are downtown and have the time, this is a place we enjoy. The steaks are superb and you can't go wrong with any cut- ribeye, strip, and filet are favorites in my family. We always get the fried potatoes, mashed potatoes and sides of asparagus. Each one was perfect and this is consistent across every visit. I like to also get a salad and have been happy with this as well. 
As you can imagine in any old school steakhouse, the service is precise and polished and our waitress was great. It was crowded when we went but she was efficient and it was a wonderful meal.
Suggest you save room for the chocolate cake and cheesecake when they are available as these are out of this world.
If you are in the market for a great steak at a reputable establishment, Mortons is for you."}
{"text":"Okay, so sometimes you just have to figure a restaurant has an off night.  Then you give it some time and revisit the place.  Well, that just didn't work out in my case.

Went back to Morton's tonight for their \"lobster special\". Special?  Seriously?  For $40 you got a 2 pound lobster...that's it. No salad, no side, nothing. (Oh yeah, they brought you a loaf of bread.) 

In my party of four, three of us had lobster, one had the filet mignon. Four guests, four underwhelming meals.  The meat was subpar and the lobster was chewy, filled with black sludge and tasteless.  None of us had ever seen so much and such dark liquid inside a lobster before.  It was quite unappetizing to look at and sadly, the waiter never brought us a plate/bowl to discard the shells, insides etc into so there sat the sludge on our appetizer/bread plates staring up at each of us.

We ordered a side of Brussels sprouts to share.  They too were tasteless and very oily.

Dessert was fair. An $18 piece of mediocre chocolate caked topped with vanilla ice cream and a large mound of whipped cream. Certainly not worth the price.

After paying the $360 bill for four (including tax and tip) we all agreed that we would not be returning to Morton's.  This was not another unfortunate bad night, this was just BAD!"}
{"text":"Morton's served me a lovely steak, but sometimes it just takes ONE thing for the entire evening to be marred.  

They don't have butter knives!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Or really any knife that isn't a huge, heavy, shank-like, steak knife.  

Really!?

Ok, so I get it.  You're a steak restaurant, but you know what - I like to butter my bread with something that weighs under 5lb.  In that respect, I'd like a butter knife.  

Oh, but Cami T...you're being unreasonable!  How was the rest of your meal - you may ask?  It was fine.  It wasn't anything out-of this world...I mean it was a steak with some sides.  I've made steak before.  It tastes just like steak.  

Oh, but Cami T...how else do you expect to cut steaks, but with a huge steak knife?  You know what, I'm not saying that steak knives aren't useful.  In fact, LeBron rumored to have gone to Mortons and had the staff cut up his steak for him.  Maybe he was as frightened by the steak knives as I was?  I'm not talking about steak-cutting, I'm talking about regular eating and butter spreading.  That's where I'm at...not the steak cutting.

Oh, but Cami T...this is such a small thing, in an otherwise great meal, right?  Eh.  I'd rather have gone to Lola/Greenhouse/Blue Pointe/etc.  

And since I'm at it, I might mention that when I went there I had a broken arm so I was especially stifled by the whole huge heavy steak knife thing.  I had to have my boyfriend cut up my food for me all embarrassing style because I couldn't even lift it and I felt like I might murder someone (or myself) with my left hand.  So yea, maybe I'm biased but holy shit...how hard is it to have ONE BUTTER knife in the whole restaurant!?!?

Harumph!!!"}
{"text":"Finally I dined at a Morton's Steakhouse after planning to do so for years.  And I was well repaid by a fine dining experience on the tail end of Restaurant Week after a 4-hour drive to get back to Vegas before the 2018 version of RW came to a close.  Diane and I agreed that this year Morton's had the best selection of RW menu items to satisfy our tastes, which we still augmented a bit to try out additional dishes, taking into account that a three-course meal plus one side was being offered at a price ($50) that was less than one steak alone on the regular menu.

So, we began with two appetizers: a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and Bacon Wrapped Sea Scallops.  Five good-sized shrimp were presented with an excellent Cocktail Sauce, and the shrimp were meaty but not really sweet.  Three delicately cooked luminescent Sea Scallops each seated on a green leaf were encircled by a long strip of pliable cooked bacon.  They were quite tasty but quickly dispatched.

While Diane then opted for a cup of velvety Lobster Bisque, next for me was a cup of Five Cheese Baked Onion Soup, which was an excellent rendition of French Onion Soup, with well caramelized onions and a nicely melted cheesy top.  Next time I will order a bowl!  I should mention that the soup went very well with buttered chunks of bread from a clearly house-baked onion-studded loaf.

I then enjoyed a large classic Caesar Salad topped by an elongated breakable crouton and two requested anchovies.  The Romaine Lettuce was fresh, and the Caesar Dressing creamy and delicious.

Perfectly medium-rare 8 oz. Choice Grade Center Cut Filet Mignon steaks were next up for both of us, presented with requested complimentary Bearnaise Sauce and unasked for au jus.  The Bearnaise Sauce was good but appeared to have broken before it reached our table, whereas the au jus was particularly tasty ladled over the very juicy, buttery, and well-seasoned meat that tasted more like Prime Grade beef.  \"Twice Baked\" Au Gratin Potatoes were a superb included side, while Diane, who disdains horseradish on anything, was presented with specially prepared plain Mashed Potatoes topped by Gruyere, two Sharp Cheddar Cheeses, and pieces of bacon at no additional charge.  She liked this dish well enough to have its remnants packed up for lunch the next day.

By this time we were both really full, but still eagerly awaited the included desserts.  While Diane delighted in a Hot Chocolate Cake that had a molten center and was enhanced by a large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, I liked my generous slice of Key Lime Pie sporting a very tasty crumbling Graham Cracker Crust bottom.  The pie filling was not very tart and tasted more like lemon than lime, which I prefer.  This pastry was topped by a delectable cloud of Whipped Cream, which I washed down with a cup of Coffee made from French coffee beans.  For unknown reasons only half a cup of coffee was initially poured for me, but I quickly received a generous additional cupful upon request.

Service by our server Davis was excellent and accommodating, and our seating luxurious in a large white-linen-tablecloth-topped booth that was clad in faux alligator skin.   I just thought it was odd that a steak knife had to be used for everything, including the buttering of bread, although we were provided with changes of steak knives as various courses arrived.

XXXX-1/2 stars overall, so I will definitely not wait for the next Restaurant Week to come around to make a return visit."}
{"text":"I have been a longtime, loyal customer of Morton's for probably more than 20 years.  The one star is not a reflection on the staff (they are excellent) or the atmosphere -- it's a gorgeous restaurant.  This is regarding the quality of the food since Landry's took over.  The quality of the food does not justify a bill for $400 (not including tip) for three people. We did order drinks, but still, that is way too much money for mediocre food.  The food literally tastes like it is prepared off-site somewhere and re-heated. The final straw was the cheesecake we ordered for dessert.  It is a flat, round, tasteless circle with a slimy plop of whipped cream, and some mushy, rotting strawberries.  And what the heck was that stuff sprinkled on top -- Hungarian Paprika? My first thought was this looks exactly like the desserts you would find in one of those tin-foil compartments from a 70s T.V. dinner.  I actually took a picture because I feel this is an affront to all cheesecakes!  Important:  Mortons, please don't contact me offering a free drink or dessert to give your restaurant another chance -- I give up.  Landry's ruined your brand, and I will not be back."}
{"text":"What can I say? This is beef euphoria in wine heaven! Always consistent , always delectable, always special treatment ."}
{"text":"I go to a restaurant for the ambience as much as the food; good food makes it all the better. But when I came here, unfortunately, I didn't get much of either. The crowd was the business, after-work, snooty crowd - not much fun for my hubby and me. Service was fine. But the steak - which is supposed to be the best part - just didn't live up to my expectations. Nothing to write home about; pretty bland. Definitely not worth what you're paying for. I think I'm more of a Ruth's Chris fan.

The best part was the presentation: When the server showed the plastic-looking lobster - AND IT MOVED - that part was fun!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience when I had dinner here with my parents. We were celebrating their anniversary and the hostess greeted us wishing them a happy one. When we arrived at our table, it was decorated for the occasion - silver star confetti for their silver anniversary. We also recieved custom menus that we got to take home. Customer service was great on the phone as well as in person."}
{"text":"It's Morton's... High end steakhouse with high end decor, service, and food quality. Nothing particularly amazing or different from this locations, but I did find the 3 course special to be a great value. Morton's was just purchased by Landry\"s which may lead to even more corporate feel. I could tell (because our waiter told us) that most of the staff is not exactly thrilled about the acquisition. We will see..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go out to eat for NYE. Our first reservation fell through so we set up a reservation for Morton's last minute. I have to say, we definitely lucked out! They gave us cute beads, party horns, and headwear. It was a nice touch. Our server was Luis and he was AMAZING! Best service we have had in a long time. The food was great and we had an overall AWESOME experience."}
{"text":"Still havn't heard back from management.
This proves my point, they could not care LESS!
Perhaps we should all spend our hard earned money elsewhere?"}
{"text":"I've been a filet snob since working at a few steakhouse years ago.
The \"power hour\"  Filet Trio is the best!
Amazing sauces complement the perfectly cooked filet. A bargain for $7.
I also had the BLT crab cakes ($7), these were also good but dry, so I asked for mayo and lemon. That did the trick!
Drinks are a bit steep, well they are for me, cause I'm used to free or almost free!
I had an $8 Manhattan that was very good. Draft beer is $5.50, not that pricey. 
The \"Power Hour\" is 4:30 to 6:30, every day but Saturday, and this is the best time to come for appetizers. When I was there at 6, there were plenty of seats at the bar and also lots of bar tables available."}
{"text":"Not worth the price or hype.

We had a really disappointing meal here. Upon arriving we ended up waiting ages because the young lady left in charge of seating was still learning and didn't know where to seat us (not her fault). The restaurant was mostly empty and we had a reservation. When her manager arrived some time later we got no apology from him for the wait.

We were given a wine list and made to wait for our menus, which was strange, as normally you order wine to complement your food choices. When we asked for menus the waitress was short with us.

Bread and butter was delived without a bread or butter knife. And my steak knife wasn't swapped out even though I didn't order a steak, which made eating awkward.

Sides were terribly bland, as were my king crab legs, which either had too many freezes on them or had just been in the freezer too long. My husband said his steak was good,  but nothing amazing. My glass of wine was the highlight. No one checked on us during our meal, and it took a very long time for someone to sort our bill so we could leave.

You pay far more than it's worth here, it feels like a chain and attention to detail is lacking. We are more than happy to pay more for a great meal out, this definitely didn't fall into that category."}
{"text":"Horrible Valentine's dinner. Ordered the Cajun ribeye and it was served well done instead of medium. Sent back and it took so long all my sides were cold and my wife was done with her meal. Not the Valentine's Day dinner I want to remember. No offer of anything or even an Apology. After spending $300 that I work very hard for on a special evening make me. It ever want to go to or recommend Morton's ever again. I plan on posting reviews since all that is cared about is money. It's obvious how the billion dollar buyer got that billion. By just charging for lack luster food and not caring about the customer. Maybe his show should be called greed. Oh wait that one is taken"}
{"text":"This restaurant will not let you place a to go order unless you go in to the restaurant and wait for it. What is the point? You might as well eat at the restaurant then.  We have kids and we would like a nice meal to go. We will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We took our grandchild/niece for her 21st BD.  What a wonderful experience. Everything was grand.  Thanks. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"It's good to know the quality of this standard keeps it's name safe.  Great steak. Service was polite but slow compared to the Chicago standard. Breads were standard onion loaf. Lobster bisque good, oyster rock below standard.  Asparagus was perfect as well as the steak."}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of an expert on Mortons.  If I was on island (home), I ate a the Honolulu restaurant every Saturday from Jun 2007 to May 2011.  Since that time the restaurant has been sold to Landrys.

So what did I notice today when I went there tonight.  First, Maitre d and manager weren't wearing tuxedos any more.  Given that Landrys recently bought McCormick and Schmicks and closed the Phx location in addition to the Phx Mortons, I think there's a serious change afoot.

How does this reflect on quality?  Perhaps to early to say.  But on the other hand cutting away at something as small as management in tuxedos may seem inconsequential, I can guarantee you that there will be 2nd and 3rd order effects that will impact food quality.

Now having said all of the above we ate in the bar.  Ordered the sliders, blt crab sandwiches, mini wedge salad and a bowl of lobster bisque.  I was all good reflected pretty much what we had in Hawaii over the last 4 years.  Having said that, I will go out on a limb here and say that if the tuxedo cutting culture makes it's way into the kitchen, then I predict one of the first casualties will be the crab cakes.  Good crab cakes are hard, and expensive to make.  Cheap or Cheaper ones are easier.  But it you're cutting out tuxedos...a very visible sign of the restaurant...it will be very easy to make cheaper crab cakes."}
{"text":"Morton's is a mediocre steakhouse. We've had better steaks at Larson's which is less expensive. The table for 4 of us was super tiny and when we asked for a booth we were told they have to be requested...isn't that what I'm doing now! One of our steaks was supposed to be butterflied but when it came out it wasn't. The steaks had a lot of liquid surrounding it and wasn't seared well.  The chocolate cake tasted like a box cake and the ice cream sundae was melted so much it was like soup. Won't be coming here again especially since there are so many other excellent steakhouses in town with better food and service,"}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to Mortons since I've heard about their great reputation. In all honesty our food was not impressive and for the prices it was disappointing. The presentation was lacking creativity. The fish and the filet we had was dry. Overall, we spent around $300 and we were not impressed."}
{"text":"I have been to several Morton's locations prior to this and never had a bad experience. It was my husband's birthday and i planned a surprise dinner. Unfortunately, the service and food was poor. The orders were wrong, the food was cold, the checks were completely wrong, the wait time for drinks and food was long. Overall, a terrible experience. When i pay $230 for food, at minimum i expect it to be hot and correct."}
{"text":"I went to Morton's for dinner last night and was once again blown away.
I ordered the bacon steak for an appetizer, it was a really thick cut if pork belly cooked well done. It was rich, juicy and perfectly seasoned. They must cure it in house because it is nothing like store bought bacon.
For dinner I had their house red wine, a Chicago bone in ribeye a lb of king crab legs and the button mushrooms with spinach. My steak was perfectly marbles and cooked amazing. It still blows my mind that Morton's can get a beautiful crispy outside in a steak while keeping the inside properly cooked rare. The king crab was fresh and served hot despite that the legs were split down the middle. I find most restaurants end up serving it cold because it takes a while to split them, not Morton's; they nailed the timing.
Morton's is the most expensive dinner I have ever had, and I may have gone a little bit overboard getting an entire lb of crab to myself, but I would have happily paid even more for perfection."}
{"text":"I place this as third on my list, Peter Lugers being first and an empty spot being second. 

The steak was good but lacked flavor. It's an ideal place to go if you don't like your meat with a bit of flavor. 

I was also underwhelmed with their lobster mac. The food could've been better, maybe because it was the Vegas location. Idk. 

We had a great view of the Vegas strip from our table. 

The sever kept trying to pressure us to add drinks to our order even though we told her we weren't drinking that night. It almost ruined my experience but she eventually left us alone.

We spent about $200 for a table of two, including left overs. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Constantly my #2 or even #3 for steak. There's so much more. 

8:00 And very busy
Loud
Full bar
Made reservations with OpenTable and was seated right away. 
Drives me crazy when the \"by the glass\" offering is uninspired and short. 6 reds from $12-20 but nothing great. Already paying a per glass markup, let me drink something good. 
Mixed crowd of business diners and dates but must carnivores at this hour are in their 40s and 50s but attire is simple. Come in long pants, slacks or jeans and a collared shirt. You'll be fine. In a suit, you will fit in too. 

Mortons does a great job of drawing the evening out with elaborate \"presentations\". 

Bread- massive onion loaf the size of your head. Well, maybe not yours, but it's big. I actually have no idea the size of your melon. 
Next rolls the menu. If you've not been here it maybe interesting but for steak livers, you know what red meat looks like. It is however a great representation of the cut sizes. But that's not all. After showing a selection of Prime Beef under a very appetizing layer of plastic wrap, fish too makes the cut along with veggies. Of you've never been to a market and seen a real tomato, bundled asparagus, red onion or a basket of greens, you my friend, are in for a treat. Before the cart rolls away, a real menu is handed over. 

Yes, it's fun. The first time. Sort of like the first time to the top of CN tower. Have you ever been back? See what I mean?
Enough of my sarcasm. How's the food?
The bread is warm and delicious. 

Fun, seafood starters but I like to start with greens and the Chop (save a couple bucks from the wedge) is fine. 

When it comes to beef, I go for 2 cuts: filet and prime rib. Since the rib is only offered on weekends (this is true of many steak houses), I signed up for a filet, medium rare and Oscar style. What you'll get should you follow my lead is the most tender of cuts with some lump crab and hallendaze sauce. It's traditionally served with a few spears of asparagus too and thats true here. . Ask for the sauce on the side so you can really taste the amazing flavor of the beef. Unfortunately, the beef is cut in two and on an English muffin so much of the heat escaped. My side dish was hotter. I'll know better next time and so will you. 

If you want to spurge, order the filet \"bone in\". You really can taste the difference.

Sides are a-la-cart. My money's on the creamed spinach but many go for the hashbrown. I worked in a steak place in Las Vegas years ago and am still surprised when people want this for dinner. Just not me. The spinach does not disappoint. 

Desert is good here even though I'm not a sweets guy. Pre order the suflay of it's your thing. 

The low down, dirty shame is that Morton's tries really hard. Historically, I don't rate them more than a 4 and on average, a 3. Why? They could do better. Yes I'm picky and paying skhsjsjss for this meal with 3 glasses of wine, I can be. It's the little things. 
1. Dinner for one, 1hr 45mim. If I had someone to talk to, great. But I'm a single guy. 
2. Tries too hard with presentation. Ask me of I would like to see the cuts or want the giant bread. I don't want either. 
3. My steak is consistently dry. Medium rare beef has deep juices. I want those. Where are yours? 
4. Limited wines by the glass. The key here is your mixed crowds. Not everyone drinks the same thing. You force it. Let go and let live. 

But that's me folks. The majority will not have issues but you're still reading my review so thank you for sticking in there. 

The bottom line, give it a shot of you have no other choice. For me, it's convenience when I travel. Nothing more."}
{"text":"High End Steak House suited more for the older client or business traveler. Definitely not for young kids or families. 

Atmosphere is dark inside to give you the ambiance of a high end restaurant. Huge wine list and good size bar.

Shared the 24oz Porterhouse, Baked Stuffed Shrimp and Caesar Truffle Broccolini. 

The Porterhouse was prepared as requested and a good size slab of beef. Was served bone in and very juicy. 

The Baked Stuffed Shrimp was a good compliment to the Porterhouse and Caesar Truffle Broccolini. The shrimp was stuffed with crab and had pasta on the side. 

The Caesar Truffle Broccolini was recommended by our server and was very tasty. 

Our server - Katie was very good and patience and full of recommendations. She definitely knew the menu well.

Mainly came here to use a $50 gift card and still paid $92 more for the 2 of us.

Kind of place to celebrate special occasions."}
{"text":"I know I'm a steak snob but I found this Mortons perfectly adequate. The service was just okay. We asked our waiter for a recommendation on a side dish and he not only forgot to bring it but also what we ordered!  And you think they were bottling it themselves when we asked for a second bottle of wine. The only saving grace was the chocolate mousse which was a little cup of whipped heaven."}
{"text":"What can one say about Morton's other than bring a fat wallet and prepare yourself for a steak dinner as it should be.   Properly aged and cooked prime beef in monstrous proportions.  Supremely huge and good sides. Was that a football or a baked potato?  Stellar if a bit snooty service. It's all here. It's a chain but a damn good one..."}
{"text":"Tried some of the 'Power Hour' bar specials tonight. I had a gin martini with petite filet mignon sandwiches. My friends tried the mini crab cake sandwiches, a Cosmo and some wine. We were all very pleased with everything! The filet was so tender and a perfect portion. Items were reasonably priced at $7-$8 each. Not sure why I haven't been there before, but I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 6:45 and we seated immediately. Service was outstanding and atmosphere. I had the porterhouse and my wife had the filet. We shared the Brussel sprouts & cheesy potatoes. The food was excellent and also the wine. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Place was amazing, I like the dimmer lights, the bread is too die for it's soo good & freshly done. I ordered filet mignon, it was perfectly done we also got creamed corn, I've had better but it was still pretty good lol anyways we didn't make reservations but they still got us in, I mean it wasn't too packed anyways. The service was great  although I did ask for a booth but they said they didn't have anything available boohoo not a big deal since we didn't make reservation but I know if they really wanted to they could had gotten one for us since I saw one available lol. Over all  place is amazing  highly recommended"}
{"text":"I wanted to try out the happy hour...just get something quick.  I did a quick skim of the happy hour menu and decided on getting the Tuna Tacos (something different).  The set up was really cute lol, but at the end...the tacos were okay.  My server/bartender was nice."}
{"text":"Anything over medium rare is blasphemy (only tolerated if you're preggo in my books, okay?) and my experiences at Morton's of San Francisco did not go smoothly.

I found Morton's here to be a tad better. Service was prompt and everything.
They made special menus for my friend's bachelorette dinner with her name on it but had the date completely wrong. It was July but the menu said April (haha) They quickly reprinted new ones with the right month.

I admit, I had low expectations walking in. There are a plethora of exceptional steakhouses in Vegas, the strip is just chock full of them. However, Morton's was do-able.

I always order medium rare. Like I said, anything done over that is just carnivorous sin. I think Morton's and I need a  steak cooking 101 because some sort of lost in translation thing is going on. 

My definition of medium rare is a warm red center. What happens at Morton's? 

It comes pink. 

This happens at the San Francisco location as well.

*sigh*


I would have sent it back if I weren't starving from being on a liquid diet. 

Don't get me wrong!! I don't mean I was actually ON a liquid diet. I meant the Vegas diet. You know, booze.

Anyway."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here to celebrate me getting a new job and I went through the list of Bookmarks on Yelp trying to find a place. We opted for here since I'd never been. We've been to Mastro's several times, Flemings, and the like but I had my two choices down to Morton's and Dominic's at the Quarter. My finance used to come here a lot several years ago and raved about their food so even though it had a lower rating on Yelp, I decided to give it a shot. 

Made reservations on OpenTable the same day and all time slots were open and I was glad to get our 7pm reservations so easy. I noted that we were celebrating a new job in the notes.

We arrive about 15 minutes late due to some late traffic but check-in was easy. The valet outside is free if you are eating here (with a tip of course) but we did have to wait for another car in front of us to pay $6 since they weren't eating here. I was surprised walking through the double doors at the decor. It felt a little bit like walking into a Sizzler from when I was a kid. The doors were old and it didn't get me too excited about what we were in for. The decor in the rest of this place was okay...big shaded lights hang from the ceiling and they have the U shaped booths lining both walls that I have mixed feelings about. They're a major pain to get in and out of but they're nice to cuddle up in if it's just two of you.

They had our table ready for us and the hostess was friendly. When we were shown to our table there was confetti on the table and on the top of the menu it said Congratulations. I thought it was a nice touch but wasn't overly surprised since I had made a note on our reservations. When I didn't have too much of a reaction my fiance asked if I noticed it and when I said Yes, he told me that he had called ahead and asked what they could do for the celebration. In addition to the decorations, the hostess came back and took our picture and presented it later in a nice paper frame that said Congratulations on my new job. I thought it was  a nice touch.

We were promptly greeted by our server and while not overly smiley, he was nice and genuinely seemed interested in our special occasion and even checked out our picture later. After giving the menu a glance we opted for the chopped salad and $17 crab cake as starters, a 6oz filet cooked medium plus, a Cajun seasoned ribeye, cooked medium rare, with the creamed spinach and twice baked potatoes au gratin for sides. They brought over a loaf of the onion bread and while I initially thought I wouldn't like it since I don't like onions, I tried it and thought it was amazing! I could have easily eaten the whole loaf! 

Our chopped salad was really good though I thought the bacon was really crunchy. It did say bacon bits on the menu so I'm guessing that's how it's supposed to come. The crab cake was really good but there was only ONE about 3\" in diameter. While good, for the money we'd definitely skip it next time. And then our steaks came out. Standard white plating with some garnish on the side. I was really surprised when my filet came out and it was thin...no more than an inch thick. I'm accustomed to steakhouses at this price point to be a thick cut of meat usually 3-4\" thick. I cut into the slightly thinner side and it was well done but had good flavor and was tender. The further I cut into it, it was more medium so it was okay but I still couldn't get over the thin cut of meat. When we were asked by our waiter how everything was, we mentioned about it being overcooked and he did offer to cook another one but really, the flavor was good and I didn't want to waste the piece of meat. When I had three bites left, the manager came over and offered again to prepare another steak for me and that he wanted us to be completely satisfied. He was really nice and he seemed really genuinely interested in our satisfaction which is probably why I'm giving them 4 stars. The other reason for the four stars is for the potatoes! They were delicious! I haven't had too many carbs in the last three months and these were divine. So cheesy and cooked perfectly and while they weren't thin like a normal au gratin, I thought the chunks were unique. My finance's steak was cooked perfectly though and he enjoyed it. I will say I'd skip the creamed spinach. Wasn't my favorite. We were also given a complimentary chocolate suffle for dessert and while I've never had one before, I thought it was really good! Light and fluffy and not too filling after eating nearly all of the potatoes :)

One other really nice gesture was our waiter picked up our valet card and had them bring the car around for us so it was waiting outside when we left. EVERY valet place should do this! 

While the steak wasn't ideal, the other items made up for it. I won't hurry back but I wouldn't hesitate to come back for that bread and potatoes!"}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday and was impressed with the personalized menu they served us that said \"Happy Birthday\" at the top. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked, and the service was attentive and professional. We really enjoyed the meal and service here."}
