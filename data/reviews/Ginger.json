{"text":"Buyer beware. Just came from this place that I had frequented for at least 7-8 years. I usually take the seafood soup. There is small and large version, large around $2 more expensive.
Why am I writing this? Buyer beware. They cut portions at least 30%. Large used to have 3 shrimps, now it is only 2. Small one still have 2 shrimps (maybe you are wondering why should you buy large when both large and small offer the same amount of protein? That question also crossed my mind when I ordered large portion. I immediately returned it for smaller version, but to my surprise besides those 2 shrimps I saw nothing else that resembles seafood. This used to have scalops and few other items, much more noodles, and I think the bowl size used to be bigger (the large one is now what smaller one used to be).

In any case, beware what you are getting for almost $10 of your hard earned cash. 

Now, I understand that restaurants make food portions smaller all the time, but I have never witnessed this kind of fraud. Either these dudes are closing the place soon (and along shave s sheep or two - unfortunately today I was such a sheep), or customers are sheep in general and do not look into their food, especially when it is easy for restaurant owner to hide proteins under the  pile of worthless items (it only looks like scalop but I assure you it is not).

This is my goodbye to this place. While I am writing this I am sipping my tall Starbucks coffee, and either I am going nuts, or the tall cup is now at least 30% less then it used to be?! Anybody?

Buyer beware, please."}
{"text":"We had rare beef pho, pad Thai, Vietnamese coffee on ice and a taro bubble tea. Delicious for $25."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I got to Canada 8 years ago and it's been nothing but amazing. We go anytime of year and it's busy. The food is incredibly fresh and delicious anything that we've ever ordered. My sisters a vegetarian and there's always more than one option for her to eat there. price wise each meal is under $10. Seating is very limited and the restaurant is ver low budget looking. Regardless the Vietnamese food is amazing no matter what you order."}
{"text":"This was awful! Ordered the vegatable with tofu pad thia. Noodles were stale and dry. Only 3 tofu cubes for a dinner plate. Vegatables were dry and soggy. No flavor! Very disappionted! I have been to Veitnamese restaurants and the food is full of flavor. Not this place!!"}
{"text":"It's literally the worst pho I've ever had. I've been a few times because I live close and I LOVE PHO and every time it's been mediocre to terrible. They don't use fresh ingredients (as in their greens are black around the edges) and their broth is luke-warm... not even warm enough to cook the rare beef. Avoid or be sorry."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pho I've ever had in my life. They also forgot one of the order. Hmm.. worst service and worst quality of food. One star :)"}
{"text":"I first discovered this place about 2 years ago and I really enjoyed the taste of their food as it was a great place to get authentic Vietnamese food for reasonable prices.

This week I decided to eat there for the first time in almost a year.  All I can say is that I had a serious case of food poisoning several hours after having their grilled chili chicken on steamed rice.  That is, frequent trips to the can and I high fever that lasted about 2 days.  I guess I should have known something wasn't right when the chicken didn't taste as fresh as I remembered.  I am not sure if this is run by the same management as before but I will never eat at this location again.

The Queen St. West location is still great.  I have been eating there quite often over the past few months and I have no complaints about them."}
{"text":"After a long day at work this is my go to place. I get the hot and sour chicken soup with a veggi spring roll. My standards are high when it comes to food and this is definitely a 5/5 in my books."}
{"text":"Came for take out. The older lady at cash (seems like the owner?) spoke with an extremely rude tone the entire time. I also had to repeat my order 4 times before she got it because she kept asking me what I want before she even finished charging the previous customer, even though she's clearly unable to multitask.
Food was below average. Fresh roll was ok, but the chicken vermicelli was mushy and the chicken lacked flavour. However, it's the closest Vietnamese restaurant in the area, so I may regrettably go back during late nights working at school to feed my craving. They offer 10% off for students (I forgot my onecard, and she refused to give me the discount even though my friends all had theirs. Which is understandable, but it would've been good business to let it slide. And I'm often mistaken as a high school student, so I doubt she questioned if I was lying..)

Food - 2"}
{"text":"Before I start with my review, let me just say I don't go there anymore. 
I used to go there all time, but recently I saw that they only have a conditional pass in their health inspection.  A conditional pass is still really bad (e.g., you can have mice in your restaurant and still have it be a conditional pass).  I told my friend about that, and she said that she also stopped going there because it gave her food poisoning once. 

But I'll continue in case you're ok with the conditional pass.  I used to come here all the time.  The pho is mediocre, but it's cheap and quick.  If you're hungry after work, it's the best place to just grab, eat, and go. There is a high turnover, lots of people here eat quickly and leave.  There's usually a spot to sit down and eat.  You can get take out as well, but it just tastes better eating in."}
{"text":"For $7.75 a dish, it is a good bargain. I get #30 which comes with tofu, rice noodles, some salad, and a deep fried spring roll. The store compares to the popular Ginger at Church and Wellesley. It takes no more than 5 minutes wait from the time I order and no tip is needed."}
{"text":"I must admit that I tried the restaurant only because it has so many reviews in yelp..
When I entered it in 6pm last Saturday, the place was almost full. It was a small and quite noisy  restaurant. 
The painting on the tables seemed to be quite old, and the surface of the tables looked dirty ( but it was not; it just seems to be dirty).

The good: price
In everywhere in the entire GTA, you probably won't find another Vietnamese restaurant could beat the price of this restaurant. And since it is more likely to be a fast food restaurant, you don't need to pay tips, which saves you more money.

The bad: taste 
The rice noodle here is the worst one in all Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto ( and I have tried so many Vietnamese restaurants here). The beef was not fresh, the soup tasted very salty and not as delicious as the soup from other Vietnamese restaurants. And the soup was not hot enough so the beef was still very bloody after merged in the soup for 5 minutes. This was the first time I couldn't finish the entire bowl of rice noodle ( and I ordered the small size ) because of the bad taste. 
The spring roll was below average and the shrimp inside it tasted very like rubber ( it must have been cooked for so long time..)

I will not visit here again."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious food, no frills.

Great time to visit in the summer when they open up the garage doors to the outside. The strawberry and mango smoothies are delicious, as is the number 62 on the menu."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here for a very quick shovel it down lunch for under $10 !!!
No it's not fancy, service is fast, you share tables ( that's fine), it does the job enuff said. Oh and the food is good......"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong...I love the fast tasty noodles and seem to be stuck on number 26 but the staff is hit and miss. Some are friendly and helpful, some make you feel like you interrupted something. Maybe they prefer only to serve during a rush when the place is packed with high school kids? But even so...I keep going back ...the food is great, fast and cheap!"}

{"text":"I actually discovered this place from Yelp even after having seen this place for years. It's placed conveniently next to a famous Toronto strip club, the sign \"GINGER\" with it's out of place tropical palm tree motif screams SKETCH and even a quick glance inside makes you run. However after recently trying out the Yelp app on my iPHone I found that this was one of the few pho places closest to my workplace so decided to give it a try.

The place is like some quick takeout joint where you eat with plastic utensils and pour your own Sriracha sauce into ketchup cups. However the service was very fast and convenient. The pho broth itself was actually very tasty and delicious which is why this place has scored a 3 Stars from me!

Food: 4
Service: 3
Ambience:1 (DO NOT TAKE YOUR DATE HERE....Sketchy and It's next to a strip club!!!!)
Overall: 3 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"So, basically I really don't do this review thing every so often but this place inspired me to start it.

Right off the bat, the ambiance of the place takes you back to probably 70s Vietnam or probably Honk Kong or Seoul or something similar where it's almost treading between nostalgic and nauseating. I have been there total of 3 times now and every single time without a fail I have been struck by its simplicity or rather plain Romney-esque blandness. 

When it comes to enjoying my night drinking at the ultra-chick bar there I Never dared to drink the misty beer in the clear cafe side casings and where Coors light cold-ness indicator is almost blue but actually its just the neon lighting which is making it that way. 

The most intriguing part about this establishment, though, is the food. Mmmm...It is remarkable in every sense of the word. The Vietnamese authenticity strikes you so hard that you actually feel that foggy, almost rice paddy field runny taste on every taste bud of yours. They don't divulge into the complexity of the menu or anything resembling close to it. Uhh Oh! I forgot you will actually see a back lit plastic thing there with different dishes' names and price etc. but the chef only has three (or on special days four) things on their menu: Chicken, Beef, Seafood. So, if you ask for anything involving chicken the chef takes the chicken chunks and throws it in boiling water or grill or something else according to the customer menu and it goes same for beef and other dishes. If you ask me, a very sustainable business model.


Two thumbs up keeping our mouths guessing every single time we take a bite!

The one star is because they are the only star in this business."}
{"text":"They might want to wash their vegetables and herbs, there was definitely sand/grit on our bok choy and cilantro. Other than that, good food for the price."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple of days ago. And WOW were we disappointed!! We ate in and waited 30 minutes to eventually get our order. There were some issues with some mixing up of customers orders which we think was part of the reason for our food taking SO long to come. Now fair enough, sometimes mistakes happen and things can take a little longer than expected. But of course you would expect to get an apology or some mention of the reason for the delay. NOTHING. So when we eventually got our meals we were quite hungry and tucked in, despite the awful customer service or lack of it. Our food both in taste and visually was really, really poor. So poor that my girlfriend couldn't even finish her meal. And I wasn't about to try it either, it looked pretty gross. My meal was barely edible but I was so hungry I begrudgingly ate it. If I could give 0 out of 5 then I would. Terrible on all fronts. THE worst meal I have eaten in Toronto. And by along way too!! Quite the award!!"}
{"text":"The Church street Ginger franchise is the newest that I know of in the city and by far one of the swankier ones, even if it still maintains that cefeteria vibe of the others. My heart will always be with the Ginger next to the Brass Rail on Yonge, but this one is a nice addition to the Church Street Village and just like the others, a great spot to grab a quick bite on the go."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, poor cleanliness.so dispointed for their food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. its my favourite restaurant in Toronto. I have been coming here for almost 15 years and I always order the same thing. Quality has not changed since then. This is the best location. The one on church is rude and don't carry the same specials, and doesn't come with the quality. Its not a fancy place, good quick eat place, probably don't want to use the restroom here either. Grilled chicken on rice with a spring roll...love love love it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely shocking and shameful service.

I ordered a Tofu Ginger Sandwich to-go and realized once I got home that it was a chicken sandwich. Went back to the place and asked them to replace it with a Tofu sandwich.

I didn't think I had to LITERALLY TELL THEM TO NOT PHYSICALLY REPLACE THE CHICKEN WITH TOFU in my sandwich!!! Once the \"chef\" took out the chicken she dropped it on to a plate of chicken and rice which was presumably for another customer... If this isn't abhorrent behaviour, I don't know what is. The cash counter and drinks are so strategically placed that only the tiniest of glimpses can be caught from the outside. This was sufficient in my case to spot what was really going on in the kitchen.

To be clear I'm not religious or anything about eating meat but just the thought that they did it so callously leads me to question what else really goes on in that kitchen. To top it all of, the cashier lady DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE! 

Screw you Ginger staff and your smug little faces."}
{"text":"There's a lot to love about the original Ginger in the chain.
1. It's like the quickest Vietnamese you will ever eat. For real, you can order, pay and eat in 15 minutes flat.
2. The prices are great. It's fast, cheap and easy. But still clean and there's tons of variety.
3. It's right next to The Brass Rail, which ads to the great street watching. Eating Vietnamese and seeing the peelers come and go from their shifts, is TO at its best.
4. And here's the best reason to love it: during the blackout, Ginger just kept on cooking like nothing had happened. They're on gas, not electricity so they weren't affected, and had a lineup a block long until they ran out of food.

The owners are women, and they are tougher than Martha Stewart on her tax attorney. They will get you in, ordered, paid and out in minutes, whether you like it or not.

No messing, it's the joint."}
{"text":"Ginger + Vietnamese cuisine is an oxymoron

{"text":"For about $7 for a small rare beef pho (with 10% off student discount) I was pretty happy with what I got. Sure, it's not THAT cheap, but for a quick fix when you're starving, I was pretty content.

I also like the set up. You order right when you walk in and get a number. Then you sit down wherever and the food gets delivered to you. It was SUPER quick. We were starving when we got in there and didn't have to wait long since it pretty much got to our table the minute we sat down. It's great because, unlike other restaurants, this is more like a cafeteria style place, where you just order and eat and don't have to worry about tipping or getting a bill.

Would definitely come here again. It was a pretty nice first experience."}
{"text":"Seeing the low reviews on Yelp, I was skeptical when my friend said she wanted to go check this place out. To my surprise, the low reviews definitely did NOT reflect my experience at this restaurant. 

First, the food came out super quickly. We ordered a large rare beef pho and a beef + spring roll vermicelli. The two dishes were prepared in less than 5 minutes. 
Second, for the price point, the two dishes were very tasty and portions were generous. The pho soup was very flavorful and came out piping hot. The amount of beef in both the pho and vermicelli was just right. All the ingredients were balanced. Also, the spring roll was perfectly fried with the exception that it was a little bland (it didn't matter bc the beef and the sauce of the vermicelli dish compensated for that). 
Minus one star due to the fact that the noodles in the pho were not the best quality/overcooked.

Overall, this place is probably the best viet restaurant in the downtown core. If you want something cheap, delicious, and quick, Ginger is the place for you. Don't let the low reviews prevent you from going to this gem!"}
{"text":"Open late, cheap, delicious, and fast. 

Great option for thai around this area. It's cheaper than comparable thai nearby. You get smaller portions (less meat) but you can't beat the price and the taste is delicious. They are friendly, amenable to changing/substituting orders, and incredibly fast. I'm relieved to have this in the area. 

I've tried their curry chicken, curry beef, pad thai, salad rolls and mango salad. Wonderful stuff!"}
{"text":"cheap and fast!
I see meat-eaters are loving it, so there might be something I'm missing... fills you up, however not sure it's more than a quick hunger fix.
I'll go there if I want something fast and won't have time to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Cheap. Delicious. Friendly. My favs are the chicken baguette (3.50$), chicken coco mushroom soup (3.95$... And OMG good.), the spring rolls, and the mango salad with chicken and shrimp (5.95$). LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"This place is really dirty. I shouldn't have stayed to eat. The food was passable but given how dirty it was in there I shouldn't have bothered."}
{"text":"I live up the street from Ginger and used to get it for takeout lunch at a couple times a week, because it's affordable, quick and the quality is pretty consistent.

However the last time I went I found a long, black curly hair in my noodles. I felt horrible because Ginger used to be a staple for me and now it's kind of ruined, because I was already back at my office when I discovered it and didn't really have time to go back....maybe I'll get over it and give it a try again but it was a pretty scarring experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to be that guy who wrote a stellar review of this place after everyone else panned them... but I won't be. I was kind of disappointed.

The \"Superbowl\" noodle soup, at $9.50, sounds like a great deal. Rare beef, tripe, oxtail, even chicken. A bit of everything.

Pros:

* XL size will fill the hungriest of stomachs
* Inexpensive
* Staff was nice

Cons:

* High noodle-to-meat ratio
* Strange vegetable stalks in the soup (lemongrass?) that tasted spicy and also felt like it poked my throat
* Broth is below-average flavor

Overall, I was disappointed with the pho. The broth left a lot to be desired, and the vegetable stalks that poked my throat weren't pleasant. I was looking for more meat, but got mouthful after mouthful of noodles. I know for $9.50 you can't expect the moon, but hey, how about a nice, pleasant bowl of pho on a cold Toronto afternoon?"}
{"text":"I agree with those who feel this is a substandard franchise of a usually good restaurant for the price.

Anine Y, you were right on in your review.  I too had the Superbowl Pho, and yes it is lower than substandard, considering it is one of the more expensive menu items.  The beef in this soup was tough, the \"rare\" beef was very thin slices of overcooked hard beef, the chicken breast was cardboardy, the tripe (I usually love tripe) was tough and flavourless, the beef balls were gross, and the oxtail (I love oxtail) was exactly 3 tiny pieces of mostly bone.  The broth was boring.  Ugh!

Butter chicken was greasy and bland.

Staff are lackadaisical and mostly sitting around eating or playing on a computer or chatting on the phone.  I don't think the kitchen staff can be bothered to put out decent food.  One star is too much for this place."}
{"text":"Great veg selections, tasty Vietnamese food, cheap prices, good portions. I have been eating here almost weekly for 15 years. This Yonge St location is the BEST Ginger location, others have slightly different flavours."}

Good quantity- especially the soup, and non veg items on your plate
Will visit again"}
{"text":"There was a period of time in my life when I had Ginger so many days in a row, I had to take a break from it.  But if you are looking for inexpensive, hearty and protein-filled meals, Ginger is a great stop for lunch or dinner.

One of my favorite menu items is the Viet-style baguette sandwiches, which are essentially a bahn mi style sandwich.  The variety I always ordered was the chicken, which comes topped with chicken breast, crunchy julienned veggies like carrots and daikon, and of course, plenty of cilantro.  This sandwich was around 3.95 the last time I went to Ginger and well worth the price.  There are also several other variations including a veggie variety.  Another good value is a side order of spring rolls, which is only a couple of bucks and quite tasty.  The fresh fruit smoothies come with more exotic tropical fruit choices such as dragonfruit and jackfruit, as well as your more commonplace strawberry, pineapple and melon.  Try a new combination and see what you like.

The brilliance in Ginger's business model is that everything you order there is ready and waiting for you to order it, and most of the combos are just protein + starch + item c (usually side veggies or broth, in the case of pho).  So if you order the chicken breast it can come in a array of combos with different noodles, rice, sauces, etc.  Everything comes out very quickly because you aren't waiting for them to make it, they are just heating and plating it.  Lots of great options for vegetarians as well as people who just want to switch it up a bit.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is cheap.  Cheap food, cheap prices, and cheap service--these are three things that you are going to find at this restaurant.  I believe that there food is filled with MSG.  Also, there are no many vegetables in their pad thai.  It is served with sprouts, egg, and tofu.  It's just so boring."}
{"text":"I like the variety of items on the menu. You just order your food at the counter and then take a seat. All your utensils and sauces are self serve on a counter, which was quite unique. 
The chicken pho was average. A small bowl for $5.50, there were 3 slices of chicken and a small handful of noodles. I was hoping for a little more because of the lack of meat, and I got hungry not long after. The soup is your typical beef broth with a touch of MSG, and already has your basil and bean sprouts inside (the restaurants in my area usually separate them.)"}
{"text":"Not much service whatsoever,
had to go up to the front to order, don't expect a menu to be hand to you if you just sit down.  After you ordered, they will however bring the food to the table, oh and if you need water you have to serve yourself too.

Anyways, onto the food.
I ordered a large pho beef noodle because I was hungry, the portion was very small I am not sure if they gave me a small as it was the first time I went there, the bowl was big but it's the smallest pho I have ever had and it was just average quality.  I had to order stuffs to eat elsewhere afterward because it just wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Had the super bowl pho. Insane amount of noodles, a fair bit (but very low quality) beef, and flavourless broth. The broth is what really makes or break good pho, and unfortunately Ginger is the worst I've tried in Toronto. Plus lots of sketch characters there late night. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a pork chop and chicken rice dish, the pork chop was under cooked a bit near the bone.  The portion is good, but the taste is average."}
{"text":"I always eat here because it's cheap and near Ryerson Campus. The food here is cheap. For those that aren't used to a restaurant like this, the routine of the place is pay first and served after.  

I typically go for the Rare beef Soup and Shrimp Fresh Rolls. The soup base was pretty good and was not as fattening as other Pho places that I've been to. 

Unfortunate high noodle-to-meat ratio."}
{"text":"Cheap. Large portions. Fast. Yummy I paid $7 for a giant giant plate of tasty noodles with tamarind tofu and greens. Order at the counter, get your number, and your food will arrive at your table in 5 or so minutes. 

In the summer they have rolling garage doors on two sides, which makes this almost like a patio and a very nice place to spend 20 minutes snarfing down some noodles."}
{"text":"I will never be returning after today's visit.
I normally order 1 durian smoothie every 2 days from there and some food. Today I made a big mistake, because I recommended to someone else and I ordered 2. This is a totally rip off. They only put sh*t loads of sugar and barely no durian in my drink .Wth, I brought you a customer you treated me like sh*t. That's why you guys were shut down by health department . Done."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with this place - was looking for a place along Yonge for a quick noodle fix so I decided to give it a shot based on the 4/5 rating. I had the veggie Pad Thai (tofu, veggies, pad Thai). The service was very quick however when my plate it arrived, it smelt funky. I love all/most foods, I'm no foodie by any means but I LOVE food in general. Ive had pad Thai at a few different places, and this version was not what I expected. I was immediately turned off based on the smell alone, and debated not even eating it. I ate the noddles which were all stuck together in a mound... Needless to say I will not be going back again"}
{"text":"Found this place on a lunch break from a class and was pleasantly surprised.  It looks like your regular fast-food restaurant from the outside, which it is to a certain extent.  Service was as you would expect from such a place but the food was amazing and so was the price.  For what you pay and get, you can't complain.  I had a combo which included, grilled chicken, pork, shrimp and spring rolls with rice, all for under $8 - where else can you get that?  Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a cheap and fast lunch."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here looking for a cheap and quick meal, and was pleasantly surprised. All food is under 10 dollar and pretty decent. Don't expect any culinary surprises, but their pho and rice dishes are flavorful and more than worth the money."}
{"text":"Ginger is a great little hole in the wall type of restaurant.  Huge menu very reasonable and quick!  Not much to look at but the menu is vast with soups, noodles and curries. Good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Consistently TASTY, DELICIOUS FOOD! Pho soup and crispy noodle (mixed grill) are my FAVOURITES!"}
{"text":"Good price for the amount of food and quality of food you get.  

After reading some of the reviews here, one thing I like to point out is that this is a self-service place, all they do is to deliver your food to your table.  You go get your own water, your cutlery, if anyone is expecting any 'service' here, they are out of their minds (for what they are paying, fast food restaurant pricing).  Not to mention factoring in the rental cost on Church St, it is not a cheap neighborhood.  

I find the good quite authentic and taste good, even my Vietnamese friends enjoy the food here.  If you like spicy food, this is the place you should check out."}
{"text":"Been going to this place since it opened. If your looking for a fairly quick, delicious and inexpensive meal, this is the place. Highly recommend the spicy chicken on rice and beef skewers on pad thai. Also, the crispy chicken rolls are to die for. Quick friendly service, this place can't be beat! And the menu is huge, lots of selection and $4 beers while you wait."}
{"text":"This place is very convenient for me to go, and with $3.50 banh mi sandwiches I'm a fan. The first time I went here, I got the kim chi and tofu sandwich, and I was blown away at how good it was - delicious tofu, kim chi, fresh carrots, and cilantro. Second time I went, they didn't add the carrots nor cilantro, but it was still pretty good and (most importantly) I was really hungry. Having learned my lesson, the third and most recent time I went, I specifically asked for the carrots. Somehow, they still didn't include them! I was a little annoyed, but when I asked the waitress again she brought me some on the side, which was fine. I don't really think I'd order anything else from here, but it's great when you're hungry and want something pretty tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ginger a lot for the past 2 years. They have really cheap Vietnamese and Thai food with good quality."}
{"text":"I came to Ginger with a friend. We were walking along Bloor St. looking for a restaurant that has a good range of vegetarian dishes (my friend is a vegetarian). Ginger seemed to offer it. 

When you enter this restaurant, you would have to order at the cash, but after ordering, you take a seat and the waitress will bring you your food. The waitress seemed annoyed when we were standing and deciding what to get, so when we finally went to order, she was rude and kept rolling her eyes on us. The restaurant cleanness (e.g., tables, utensils, etc.) was okay, not the best, but tolerable. The food tasted a little off for the pad thai.

Overall, the experience here wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good to bring me back for another time. The attitude from the waitress takes away a star from my review."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS busy. It is a fast food Vietnamese restaurant. And don't expect 5 star food. But for what it is it's great! My boyfriend and I go here when we are looking for a quick bite to eat.  For both of us with a drink its $20. You order at the till an have a seat, 2 minutes later they have the food in front of you. I love it and recommend it."}
{"text":"First I tried this place, I got a chicken and a beef sub.  It was decent tasting but the volume of meat was lacking.  At $3.50, it shouldn't be surprising.  

I decided to go back a second time to try a rice dish.  I went with the grilled shrimp, beef, chicken and spring roll combo.  Boy was that disappointing.  I have grown up eating similar dishes in Scarborough, Markham and Richmond Hill.  This was by far the poorest attempt at Vietnamese flavours.  Where's the fragrant lemongrass that's a big part of Vietnamese grilled meats?  The beef and chicken pieces were thin cuts and bland.  The spring roll was anemic and lacked any resemblance to real crispy, ingredient packed Vietnamese spring rolls.

It's safe to say that I won't be returning to try the pho."}
{"text":"I marvel at the wizardry of Ginger!  

They must have a team of talented warlocks in the back, perpetually casting spells of flavor and taste upon the food!

They must also have scientist back there unravelling the riddles of space and time in order to get you your Fresh Rolls within minutes of ordering them!

I also suspect they are heavily connected in the underground grocery mob.  How else could they charge so little, for so much!  My wife and I order 2 meals, three fresh rolls, and an avocado  shake and it only costs us $22!  That's impossible! 

I bet the guy who served us could lift a car over his head, easily!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for the pho and have never been disappointed. Today though, I tried something new: lemongrass shrimp on pad thai. For $6.99 I expected more than 50cents worth of rice noodles, 5 shrimp and some shredded cabbage. 

Lesson learned, with Ginger, stick with what you know."}
{"text":"Of all the Ginger locations, I'm pretty sure this one's my fave (and not just because it's a log roll away from me). I used to frequent Ginger 2 on Gerrard before it changed branding, but since I moved to Church, I haven't looked back. 

It's cheap. It's fast. It hits the spot. It's usually pretty busy. It's ... fragrant. I usually go for the same things - 90% of the time it's the chicken noodle soup, or occasionally one of the chicken and rice dishes. The yam and avocado rolls are terrific and I'd recommend treating yourself to a fruit shake every so often! That's right, big spender - they're worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely disgusting!!! I ordered beef rare noodles and the soup is completely black and oily and I taste so bad that I wanted to like after! I rarely comment bad things about a restaurant but this restaurant is so bad and I don't recommended at all. Also, the washroom smells really bad and the kitchen is so dirty!!! There's dust and dirt everywhere on the floor and stuff are so expensive there! I would never go to that restaurant ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Ginger has been at the centre of Toronto's gaybourhood for years and I have been their loyal patron for a while. This is a no-frills restaurant, often reminding me of how restaurants outside the western world can be- noisy, chaotic and devoid of waitresses with a fake ear-to-ear smile.

Ginger serves Vietnamese food; I don't know how authentic it is but a number of my Vietnamese friends seem to like the close approximation. I have tried a variety of dishes here: noodle soup (Pho), lemongrass noodles, few soups, rolls and rice curries. Each dish is full of flavours and spices.

Take the Pho for example: The restaurant serves a hot-and-sweet vegetarian version with tofu and lots of vegetables, besides the standard chicken and beef soups. The stock is hearty, properly hot and sour and the constituents are immersed at the perfect temperature so that nothing is overdone, Ask for some bean sprouts and basil, and you will be set.

My second favourite dish is the lemongrass noodles, either with tofu or with chicken. The protein is nicely drizzled in a spicy sauce and the noodles are cooked to the right consistency most of the times. I always thought they could add more vegetables to the plate, but that might be too much to ask for the price.

I like that this restaurant is not pretentious. You get a number when you order the food, find your own table, get your own water, add lime if you wish, then stock up on the chili sauce, peanut and other assorted condiments. Food arrives promptly by the time you settle down.

I guess this setup is not for everyone, certainly not a place to bring a date (although I admit doing that on one occasion). It's very cheap; cheaper than you think, and very humble.

Secret tip: Order the tofu-avocado hand roll, it's not on the menu!"}
{"text":"Ginger is amazing when you are in the village and need a CHEAP, hot and nice bowl of soup, as this is what Ginger at Church is for us - a wonderful soup place. Their Hot & Sour Vegetable Tofu Noodle Soup just blew our minds the first time we ever had it. Now we always go back to that in that location, as I just can't get enough.

Somebody earlier mentioned the hygiene, well, I looked around the last time I was there and indeed it looks pretty dirty, as the walls are covered with different kind of food splashed on them, but as Omer Q just few posts earlier wrote: \"The service never changes with the exception it gets better as they get to know you and the hygiene always looks questionable but I haven't heard of anyone dying yet.\" So this is how things really are. They get to know you, imagine that from all the customers who ever go there. They do a good job serving hot food fast and smile. 

Last time I was there needed to use ladies room after eating and in my head was thinking: \"Oh my, I do not want to go there as it is dirty\", but you know, it wasn't, it just looks dirty (on probably is) as the walls of youth center and community centers. Anyway the booth was clean and the sink and all, so I was actually satisfied.

Main thing still is the food, which is good and cheap. We are loving it!"}
{"text":"Hi, I visited this location near yonge and dundas a couple times and was quite disappointing each time. The food is mediocre for the high prices but what is most frustrating are the owners/employees. The boss is a short haired Vietnamese woman, and she was quite rude when greeting my friends and I. I know this isn't a cultural bias as i've been to numerous Vietnamese pho stores and have always been greeted nicely and politely. I was throughly dissapointed by the mannerism of the staff here and would recommend not to come to this location! the one at church is alot more friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"Hmm this branch of Ginger kind of sucks compared to the others (not that the others are mind-blowing pho, they are however acceptable for when you crave pho). Service wise it is no frills, you pay upfront and get a little number card and the food will be delivered to your table. You get your own napkins, condiments and water in front. It is cheap and is a place to grab food on the cheap, eat, and go, so I don't really mind the \"service\". However, there are sooo many issues with the food, I have tried the grilled chicken baguette and it is alright, and I have had the Superbowl Pho a few times, all times were substandard. This Pho has beef, chicken breast, tripe, beef balls, oxtail.
Reasons why the Pho is not good:
1) The beef here is not raw sliced beef, it is very overcooked bland beef. All the other meats are bland.
2) The broth isn't flavorful and is kind of weird compared to other Pho broths, it is kind of sweet which is not that palatable.
3) No basil and bean sprouts or fresh chillis served on the side, there is a few strands of bean sprouts added into the broth for you.

The positive about this branch is that it opens till verrrryyy late, I guess catering to the stripper going crowd since it is right next to the Zanzibar. Overall, I would only come if I am reallyyy hungry and want Pho and all other options around the area have closed."}
{"text":"Ginger at this location is clean, the pho is not as great as pho hung or xe lua, but it is probably the best option for pho in that area. The pho here is average, the broth does not have a bunch a dept, the noodles are not overcooked, not a lot of beef comes in he pho here. However, when in a fix, it is satisfying enough if I crave pho but does not want to stray far from home. Overall, it is not a place to make a trip for, but if you live in the neighborhood and wants Pho, it is a good option."}
{"text":"I just started going to this place and it's become my favourite Vietnamese food in the city.  The Beef Pho noodle soup is my go to order, and the chicken spring rolls are AMAZING!  
The staff are also very friendly and super quick service :)  It's a nice atmosphere to sit in and eat, cute colours and free flavoured water."}
{"text":"************CLOSED, TURNING INTO MENCHIE'S**********

WHAT was that?

I am a Ginger fan, mostly frequenting the Yonge south of Bloor location. On a bicycle ride through the beach yesterday, the SO and I decided to stop to get something to eat. Ginger (I thought) was a a cheap and predictable choice.

First off, there is a patio which is nice. And Menus. We did, however have to go in and get our own menu, and seat ourself at a table. And go in to order as well. 

I ordered the vermicelli with tofu and spring roll (bun) which is a delightful combination of lettuce and pickled carrots and salad greens and soft delicious tofu and fish sauce at the other locations. Here, the tofu was very old and dry, the noodles were like spaghetti, and they served it with a thick gelatinous goo and soy sauce, not fish sauce.  There was also almost zero lettuce greens. Basically hard old tofu spaghetti. I had to ask for fish sauce, hot sauce and chopsticks as they gave me fork and knife (really?) and no napkins. It was pretty brutal. I would have preferred the stand like the other locations where I can grab my own sauce, sticks and napkins as I see fit.  

My meal was definitely sub par and the portions (and menu) are much smaller and the prices higher than my usual Ginger. My meal was pretty awful and my SO left hungry. The bill was, however, only $14.

Extra Minus Points for the incredibly haunting subterranean wash room complete with delapitated shower, broken light and toilet paper roll dispenser in place of paper towel. I am surprised I made it out alive. (too dramatic?)

Meh. I give it two stars for the patio and for $3.25 beers."}
{"text":"In university, I used to eat at the Ginger south of here, honestly like 4 times a week. Meal and pop was under $5. That one doesn't exist anymore, but its older grungier brother does, and it is steps from my office. 

Ginger isn't epic, by any means, and its not really Vietnamese either. Its fusion which is admittedly something else entirely but really good value. 

The price has increased slightly over the years, and the customer service is still of the quick and dirty variety. Line Up, view boards overhead, select, tell cashier, hand money, be given number sign, scramble for available seating, pick up chopsticks napkin and chili sauces, sit down and wait less than 5 minutes before your food is brought out. 

Their fish sauce is super sweet, spring rolls are decent, their tofu dishes (tofu vermicelli with spring roll) are really good, and as I mentioned in the Hanoi 3 Season's post http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hanoi-3-seasons-toronto#hrid:O-TCupsyMu8daMSilT8sAg their Veggie Pho (Called Hot and Sour Tofu Noodle soup) Is the best that I have had in the city and is insanely inexpensive. In the $4 range. 

Good sized portions. Lunch is always super packed so go another time or get there early. Be prepared to sit with strangers. Super fast, so quick turnover. The staff will accommodate you bringing your own \"takeout\" containers from home as well. 3 stars for food and experience, extra star for price. Great Cheap Lunch."}
{"text":"I'm not hard to please when it comes to Thai food because I love it so much (I could eat pad thai for breakfast lunch and dinner)

So I would go back to Ginger, but I wouldn't run back if that makes sense. It kind of has the \"spring rolls\" feeling and taste.

I had some soup (forget which one), and I remember thinking it wasn't amazing.

I know that's a useless review - but its a review nonetheless."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and want cheap, somewhat passable Vietnamese, Chinese or Thai food, this place is okay. I've had pad thai and grilled chicken with rice which were both mediocre at best. Go elsewhere if you can and pay around the same amount for better quality."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, nice employees, good choice of food and good prices. Good for a dinner under 10$. Not fancy, very casual"}
{"text":"This place is a lot smaller than I remember it to be. Then again, the last time I ate here was years ago in my uni days. It was a good place for fast, cheap, tasty food. I came back today because I had a craving for pho and had some nostalgia upon seeing this place again. 

You order in the middle of the restaurant (more like a narrow strip now), then they give you a number and you seat yourself. Food gets brought out to you when the kitchen finishes. There's a small station on the right where you get your utensils, sauces, napkins, and water. 

I ordered a small rare beef pho. It cost just over $7 taxes included. Normally I'd eat a large size but this preggy belly means I can only eat smaller portions. The bowl was full of hot and steaming broth. It was a little on the salty side unfortunately. Bean sprouts and aromatics (basil and lemongrass) are already added to the bowl so there's no control over how much you want in there. There was a reasonable amount of beef slices added, although I felt they were a little tough and chewy. I do wish there was more bean sprouts in the bowl though. 

I wouldn't call it amazing but it hits the spot if you're craving pho."}
{"text":"Convenient location for me. Ok food ok service. But I found this one is better than the Ginger on Church St. especially PHo noodles."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and this location looks better and is bigger than the other 2 around. They serve drinks too."}
{"text":"GINGER!!!! Lol. Ok so here it is. Short and sweet.  Ginger is a really good place to get a meal under 10 bux. My personal fav is the number 57 with fried rice.  Small resturant but great for take out.  With every resturant there is improvement. So for ginger I just wish it was bigger but food is great. Service is fast. Better to order in advance as there can be a line up."}
{"text":"One of the cashiers always look very cool, I like the other guy that smile,haha. The food is good, and the price is reasonable. I think the wonton soup can be cheaper or at lease increase the quantity. My favorite is the beef chicken shrimp on rice with spring roll and the pho beef and beef ball noodle soup."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite.  I'm sure its nice in the summer when they open the windows."}
{"text":"i wonder how other people ended up with 1-stars ratings. I'm guessing the restaurant might have changed owner or staff since other yelpers' rating and my rating today. I thought it was okay. Asian single dish fast food type. The waiter was walking throughout. The food was fast. It was pretty cheap (you get what you paid). I thought it was okay. If I need a quick bite, then I still would visit this place again."}
{"text":"This is so far the best viet Thai Indian food in downtown Toronto that I've tried so far!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese subs out there!!

Found this gem when I used to work in Toronto.  Back then the subs were $2 each.  Grilled chicken was the best!

I don't give out too many 5 stars, but this one will take it for the sandwiches!

The soups are good as well and the dining is typical small serve yourself restaurant.

PS.  I once grabbed a sandwich when I was waiting in the line for the B. Rail VIP."}
{"text":"I went here for a weeknight dinner but typically this is my preferred lunch spot. It's a fast food restaurant where you pay at cash when you order and don't need to tip after eating. The food is better than most food court Vietnamese food and there's seating. 

Atmosphere:
This location is small but the table turnover is high and you can often find a seat. This is not a pretty joint you want to hang out at. Get in, eat, get out. It smells like fish sauce but it's tolerable. 

Food:
The dishes are a hit and miss. Lots of variety with pictures of the dishes plastered on the wall for easy ordering.

I ordered the vermicelli with pork and a springroll. The meat was flavourful but the spring roll didn't have much filling. The fish sauce mixture was on the sweet side which likely satisfies the masses but I prefer it more sour and slightly more salty. It was good for the price of $6.75 before tax but not as good as most Vietnamese restaurants. 

On my next visit, I'll stick to my favourites. I recommend the hot and sour noodle soup with any of the options (chicken, seafood, tofu etc), the grilled pork sandwich (less than $4!) and the avocado shake.

Price:
Most dishes are between $5.50 to $7.50, pretty reasonable for the amount of food. The portions are generous. 

Overall:
There aren't too many Vietnamese restaurants in the area so I will revisit to order my staples for a quick Vietnamese meal."}
{"text":"Top quality pho soup. Their chicken springroll is amazing too. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Found the establishment and food to be sub-par; there's a reason why the food is cheap. Arrived at lunchtime during a work week so it was chaotic both ordering and moving around restaurant. I ordered #46 which was a serving of rice, beef, chicken and shrimp, as well as a spring roll. The beef was mainly fat and the chicken was bland. A couple of things turned me off. At the napkin and utensil counter, there was a bowl of pre-cut limes. My first thought was, \"gross\", as it was out in the open and no tongs for serving. Essentially anybody could just dip their hands into the bowl to pick up a lime. The establishment looked unclean; the hallway to the washrooms was concerning. I didn't finish my meal. The place turned off my appetite . I won't be returning or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Just had the pho. Quite nice taste to it and the broth was amazing too so overall, great dish."}
{"text":"After so many years doubting the quality and authenticity of this restaurant chain, while my friends would eat here regularly and it seemed consistently full of customers, I finally succumbed to my curiosity. My order was:
Well-done beef pho: it was as I thought, poor quality meat, broth was bland and not rich; not authentic at all! 
Grilled pork banh mi: really bad meat. I had one bite and it was just horrid and threw the whole thing out.
Shrimp salad roll: same as banh mi, shrimp was so stinky!! Once again threw out.
Chicken wings with lemon and black pepper: actually decent. Seasoning actually really worked. Not the greatest mind you but I would consider having it again. 
For the price, you can find many other cheap Viet restaurants with MUCH better quality and taste. Well at least I can now say I have zilch curiosity left for Ginger."}
{"text":"This is my favourite takeout place. Their food is way better than some other vietnamese restaurant across the street. I like their no.50 no.57 and s1(sorry I'm not good at remember names).  I only hope they could get larger place, so there will be more seats and more room for people to line up."}
{"text":"I went to this place last year so can't recall exactly what I ordered - either curry chicken or rice or some type of rice dish.

Large portions, no table service = no tipping required and under $10."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and self serve water! You order and pay at the cash, you get a plastic card with your order number and the waitstaff brings out your food.

I ordered the lemon grass chicken with pad thai.  The chicken could have been in smaller pieces and the pad thai wasn't authentic but if you're hungry and in the area for cheap fast food this place will do.

My friend ordered the beef pho - she thought the beef looked kind of weird - finely cut with some fatty bits."}
{"text":"Four Stars for their friendly and efficient service.  The food is always consistently tasty.  It's cheap.  Good portion of food.

When I don't feel like cooking and don't want to trek very far for a meal, Ginger is the place I normally turn to.  Love the Charcoal Grilled Pork, it reminds me of what my grandmother used to make when I was younger.  Definitely a fan!

I wish that they would have better ventilation inside the restaurant.  Just hate smelling like grease and covered with smoke afterwords."}
{"text":"We had no idea that Ginger opened another location on Queen Street East.  We drove by the restaurant earlier this summer and noticed that it has a very nice patio.

It was such a beautiful sunny day.  We decided to drive to the Beaches area, grab something quick to eat and get some sun (before it's gone).  Since we didn't want to wait long for a meal, we thought let's go to Ginger there.

At this location, the waiter told us to seat ourselves.  He later came with a menu and glasses of water.  Everything on the menu is the same as the other Ginger locations.  

We ordered:
- #59 Charcoal Grilled Pork Chop.  It was good just like the one on Church Street.  But the portion of pork chop was half the size I usually get.

- #28 Vermicelli + Spring Roll + Grilled Pork.  It was tasty but the spring roll was a bit oily.

What we like:  Clean washroom.  That is a + + +.

If you are looking for a nice restaurant with a spacious, shady patio, that serves Asian cuisine give Ginger a try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place all the time. They are located at a very convenient location. Foods are good and prices are good. Service is good and staff are reasonable. I always come back to this Ginger."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with trying their vietnamese subs for $4.5. It's probably one of the best I've tried."}

Extra information:

*Couple locations within Downtown
*Small portions

I am craving Pho right now cause it's raining so hard and it's freezing outside! So I am going to mess up the order and write my quick review for Ginger. At first I wasn't too sure about walking away from Chinatown for Asian food...but what the heck, I saw Ginger at couple locations within Downtown so I decided to give it a try. 

At Ginger, you order at the front and pay, and they will give you a number sign where you place it at any table tht you wish to sit. And then they will bring you the food. Once you sit down with the number sign, the food doesn't take very long. 

Also, keep in mind that they have a water and sauce station beside the cashier. They have the typical Sriracha sauce and the Black sauce you see all the time at Pho places. Their sauces were kind of watered down but not as much as other places I've been to. The Hot sauce container was empty when I went to get some and as I was holding it for a second, someone noticed it immediately and refilled it.

Ordered: RARE BEEF PHO5/5
*Small bowl of pho with rare beef for $5.50
*They don't have many options for what can go into your pho
*They give you a Japanese udon spoon (something I wanted to point out)
*Unlike other Pho places, bean sprout and basil leaf is already served on top of your noodle
*Their pho is VERY SMALL IN PORTION!!
*Soup wasn't very oily and it had good beef flavor
*Vegetables (bean sprouts and basil leaf) was very fresh
*There was 5 pieces of rare beef in my Pho
*Beef was just an okay quality
*Again, very small in portion but for what you pay- it's ok
*Small was NOT enough for me (and I don't really eat much when it comes to Pho)
*Ordering Large next time!!

Ordered: SHRIMP CRISPY ROLL 4/5
*Individual Deep fried shrimp spring roll for $1.75
*Their spring rolls are very thin and long
*Served with sweet sauce on the side
*Comes hot and crispy
*Filled with whole shrimp pieces (not diced)
*Reminded me of shrimp dimsum (deep fried ones) you get at Chinese restaurants
*Little expensive for it's price but very delicious

As I polished my small bowl of pho and the shrimp crispy roll, I still wasn't satisfied! I was eyeing food that other people had ordered and their rice dishes looked a lot bigger so keep that in mind.

Summary: I think I've been to 3-4 Pho places so far in Toronto and Ginger def has the best Pho. Despite their small portion size, the flavor makes up for it. Just make sure to order large when you drop by, and maybe two if you are a guy. Ok, now I really want Pho."}
{"text":"Simple, fast, clean and wallet friendly option near Ryerson. 

Ordered #22 : rare beef and beef ball noodle soup

Have I had better pho? Yes. But for a quick and convenient option, with decent portion and quality for the price point, this place is a solid option."}
{"text":"Good, cheap food. Worth a visit, especially if you're a soup fan.

At this location (and I know the one on Church is the same) you order at the counter and your food is brought to you. They seemed somewhat impatient one time when I was ordering there, most of the time they are fine. The food is brought quickly. The food is also RIDICULOUSLY inexpensive- the soup bowls, notably the Mushroom Coconut one, are enough for a whole meal, and under 5 dollars. The restaurant itself is not particularly well decorated and is average, but seemed very clean to me. This is a staple in the Annex for fast, cheap, delicious meals. (I am a huge soup fan, and both the wonton and the mushroom coconut are A +.) I would recommend this place for lunch, or if you want to eat quickly while you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Big fan of the chicken and shrimp pad thai. The shrimp is always grilled so well, and its a huge portion of chicken as well. Good noodles and little slaw on the side. The noodles themselves could use a little more flavour and sometimes come a little dry,but overall delicious, especially given the price.

The chicken rolls also are amazing: crispy, delicious, and with a great dipping sauce.

I come here about once a week when im with friends and we want  something cheap fast and delicious.

The decor is okay, more about the food. Quick friendly staff, and a full bar. 

One warning though. The bathrooms, at least the men's, is a little.... in need of some attention."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while on vacation and my boyfriend and I loved it! He had a bánh and I had pho, and they were both delicious and the service was shockingly fast"}
{"text":"I have only ordered 1 thing on their menu, but I keep coming back for it! It's the spring roll with vermicelli and tofu. It's delicious. The spring roll is a bit greasy, but it's crispy and good. The tofu is some of the best I tried. I have tried this dish at other Viet places, but I think Ginger does it the best. Hard to believe, but I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"This place has been a favourite of mine for 15 years - BUT it's really not cool for the cashier to cover the terminal, key in the tip and then hand it to me to tap my card. 

I was a server, and I usually tip at 35%, but adding a tip without permission is shady. When I asked her if that's what she did, she pretended she didn't speak English and said \"it's ok\" and walked away."}
{"text":"It's aiiiiiiiight but it's not a-ok. I've had a few things here and while it is super cheap, edible food, the quality just isn't there. Maybe my expectations were too high?  

My fave has been the vegetable spring rolls that are little untraditional but crunchy with a great, soy sauce-like dipping. 

The butter chicken roti was SO not butter chicken roti but that serves me right for ordering such a thing at this place. Another standout was the curry pad thai which could have been ok, if not for the fatty, thin, grizzled slices of beef mixed in. Boo! 

Anywho, they are quick here and you can get warm, cheap food. There is a little condiment booth for everyone which is a nice touch to spice up your life. If you eat in, you might be dining alongside some homeless people. But it does hit the spot and make a nice alternative to other fast foods."}
{"text":"Both this location and the location on yonge are some of my favourite go-to places for some quick and cheap vietnamese food. They have a lot of options and they are very fast! The church location is usually pretty busy, but i've never had problems finding a place to sit. All the sauce, water, napkins..etc are self-serve. 
The flavours are pretty decent. There aren't many other vietnamese places around me, so ginger usually satisfies the craving for some pho or vermicelli. I'd definitely say that there are places with better quality & taste, but for the speed and proximity, this place is good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, it never changes! It's a small place and it's always busy, but everything is served so fast people are constantly getting up and leaving, so I've never had a seating issue! Fair prices, efficient staff, fast service and good food! More times than not whenever I'm at Yonge-Bloor I come by for a beef vermicelli bowl!"}
{"text":"Salad rolls were a little bland, but T&E spring rolls more than made up for it. Nice place to be on a summer day, with an open window and cheap beer."}
{"text":"Worst service and food ever...gave this place a second chance and wish I didn't...not even worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Food quality is consistent for a fast food Thai/Asian restaurant. But the cleanliness of the restaurant is not quite up to par. You could literally slide in and out on the greasy floor and tables are not regularly cleaned and are often dirty and greasy."}
{"text":"This place is actually Vietnamese, rather than Thai.  

Great cheap food for lunch time.  

While I don't think their Pho is comparable to those on Ossington, it's definitely adequate and better than the other Pho options in the business district or in the area.  

Their Bun (vermicelli) is good and I like all of their BBQ'd meats. 

I had the pad thai here and wasn't a fan (seemed very ketchupy)."}
{"text":"Vietnamese cuisine is my favourite. I don't rate this place well. Spend the time to get to China town instead of here."}
{"text":"I got number 29 (grilled pork on vermicelli) $6. It wasn't charred to my liking.  I was disappointed.  Next time I will try number 27 and 28..  The cold roll wasn't bad.  Not enough mint in mine. I am going to try their grilled chicken next time.   But their spring roll was really good.  It wasn't oily at all.  And the filling I think was taro.  It was good."}
{"text":"This seems to be the newest Ginger branch - but definitely subpar version of the original.

We were there on a weekday late lunch take out. There was only one couple in the restaurant, plus the chef eating at the back.

About 1/3 of the menu are Indian dishes, the rest Vietnamese: you have your butter chicken/samosas, as well as spring rolls and pho's. 

We ordered the butter chicken roti ($5) and mixed meat bahn mi ($3.50). 

Prices sounded good, but the food was not.
The bahn mi was basically deli cold cut meat (they tasted like Maple Leaf ham slices), and there was no butter or pate.
The butter chicken roti was cold, and the sauce had a weird, tangy, out-of-the-jar taste.

Your $5 lunch could be better spent elsewhere in the hood."}
{"text":"I've eaten at different Ginger locations, but this one has viet subs better than the rest.

This location actually gives you a lot of meat.
I usually grab a grilled beef sub and a shrimp roll for lunch.

Great lunch for around 5 bucks, can't go wrong.

- However, I don't find it the pho spectacular. ..But I'll eat it if it's cold out and I'm hungry.

It's a nice place for a quick bite.  It's a bit like a cafeteria... you see a lot of people sitting here, eating by themselves."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place in the winter when I want some soup to warm up. The veggie/tofu hot and sour soup is great. The service is fast, food is well priced, and there's lemon water which you can help yourself to."}
{"text":"Ginger has always been a reliable source of reasonably-priced, tasty food in the area. I like their selection and the food always comes fast and fresh

They have a full bar and an open seating area near the window so you can people watch.

Minus one star for the washrooms which aren't great."}
{"text":"Cafeteria type setting, the cashier / owner? rude and cannot answer my simple question.
I asked if the beef is fatty / oily, she said it's rare beef.
Hmmm, I knew that, I ordered rare beef pho. 
I kept repeating, she kept saying it's rare.
She should be honest and said it is fatty. 
Worst rare beef pho ever! I regretted spending over $8 on pile of rice noodle, some fatty low quality beef, and greasy soup. I only ate a little bit, couldn't eat anymore. It's that bad people! Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place, but you'll get served very fast, plus food is not expensive, and good for what you're paying. They have a huge menu, but in my case, I always come back for the same: chicken or beef noodle soup and pork sub!
Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times I've lost count. Why? Because it's cheap, fast, portions are large, and the quality of food is consistently good for a fast food place. There are lots of yummy veg options, for example, the veg pho."}
{"text":"got the vegetable pho and loved it! will definitely be getting it again!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service! Used to come here at least 3 times a week but after today's experience, never again will this place get a cent from me!! Extremely rude and all staff and owners should learn what good customer service looks like...its not just about taking food orders and taking our money!"}
{"text":"Another place I would never order delivery from again. I live maybe a 10 minute walk from them, and was ordering food for delivery  to save time. Well, 30 mins past, an hour, an hour and a half. I ordered it over Tasteaway, and asked them if something went wrong with my order.
  When they finally showed up, it was ice cold. And the dishes had sloshed all over each in the bag :[.
 It was terrible.

 I gotta find some decent thai/vietnamese places..."}
{"text":"It was freezing yesterday so my friend and I ended up here for some good 'ol pho.
Friend - large well done beef pho, can of pop
Me - small well done beef pho, 1 fresh shrimp roll, 1 veggie spring roll, can of pop
Came to about $20.

You have to order and pay at the counter and they bring your food to your table. Quick service even when it got real busy with people at the tables and ordering take away.

Decent food for the price."}
{"text":"This place is the best ginger franchise location in downtown if you ask me. This place definitely gets crazy around lunch time as this place is super super fast. Order a rare beef pho and it arrives in your table in 2 minutes!! 
I also really like how their grilled meat dishes are. Very tasty and the fish sauce dip is the bomb :p 
Also try their crispy chicken rolls it will definitely be a side dish staple whenever you here.
Price is around 4.99-7.99 per meal and you can't go wrong. Only complaint is the people who work here isn't that pleasant they always seem very grumpy and uninterested. I mainly go here for the food so I just suck it up. 
I give the food 5 stars but had to deduct two because of bad customer service and also stay away from their bathrooms!! It is really creepy, Id rather wait to go and use the bathroom at work."}
{"text":"Quick and convenient but food is only \"meh\"  

Its fast food so expect that.  Better tasting options do exist.  

However, I am glad to see others enjoy the food here :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has chained-out and is popping up all over the city. I'd heard one bad review, but decided to try it anyway on the new location on Queen. Any restaurant that has photos of every dish indicates, to me, that it is made for people who don't know 'ethnic' food. My suspicion stands. I found the dishes to be bland, simple, and not worth the cheap $8 it costs. I do see that it's often packed, but please keep walking- there are so many GOOD vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"the customer service was very terrible the guy on the counter only cares about money!
and the food made me stomache!"}
{"text":"I usually always order their food for delivery from their other locations through a popular website. I've decided to try this location out to see if there was any difference. I'm content with the other locations but unfortunately, not this one.

It took a full hour for the food to arrive. My boyfriend was the one who answered the door and when he came into the kitchen, I saw that the bag was leaking! Their soups are always in styrofoam containers instead of the usual plastic ones. One of them was crushed open which caused the container to have a long rip down and all the soup was in the bag instead. The deliveryman was carrying the bag in a cardboard box so my boyfriend did not notice the leak until I did. We had a big mess to clean up since he decided to take the longer walk into the kitchen (because he was chasing our cat). Our living room and kitchen had a soup trail.

I called the restaurant and told them about the soup. I asked for a replacement soup and they replied saying they will send me one. An hour passes by before I called the restaurant again, wanting to know  when will the soup arrive. She told me she would have to call the deliveryman to know but will call me back. 30 minutes passed and still no call back. Again, I called the restaurant and the same lady told me that the deliveryman already delivered it. Well apparently, he didn't deliver it to the right house since I never received the soup. Once again, she told me she will call the guy again and will call me back. 30 minutes passed before I gave up on the soup. I didn't bother calling the restaurant back because my boyfriend was beyond pissed since he had to delay his dinner for two hours, waiting for that soup while starving. We had to make our own soup for his soupless noodles.

At the end of the night, we still hadn't received the soup or a call back. Never ordering from this location again. We regret tipping the deliveryman. I'd give this place 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Quality cheap counter service food. There is lots of space to sit and visit with friends. The menu has lots of variety to suit nearly everyone (on a budget). I've likely eaten here 100 times and each time it's been good. 
The decor is not what you come here for. You come here for the food.
They also have drinks if you're interested.
They also deliver."}
{"text":"Note to anyone out there. Do not. Let me repeat that. DO NOT. Eat pho the day after you had ramen. Too damn full lol"}
{"text":"as far as I'm concerned Ginger has the best pho in Toronto. The broth itself has an almost Cinnamon flavor to it. Their chicken rolls are out of this world. There is always a line up. They have a lot of different Vietnamese foods there. The only food I don't like from Ginger is their banh mi sandwiches. I am from Vancouver and nothing in Toronto even compares"}
{"text":"I got the rare beef noodle soup and the fresh shrimp spring roll. The broth of the soup was delicious and it came with a decent amount of meat. The spring roll was also good."}
{"text":"The spicy oxtail and beef ball pho (#20) for under $10 was delicious and satisfying. I don't know what they put in it, crack or something, but it keeps me coming back for more.  It wasn't too spicy but had a nice kick. The broth was very flavourful and not much meat on the oxtail, more bone but adds flavour to the broth. Hits the spot on a cold rainy night. The place is nice and clean, cafeteria style dining and it's not crazy busy on weekends like most.

On a side note: it boggles my mind why yelpers who order pad thai in Viet restaurants think it will be good and then write a bad review based on that dish.  Well no shit Sherlock, pad thai is a dish from Thailand and you're eating in a Vietnamese restaurant.  Crack a geography book and see they are 2 different countries separated by Laos & Cambodia."}
{"text":"Ho un resto viet en plein de milieu de Church! Ici c'est la rapidité du service qui compte, ça fonctionne comme un fast food sauf qu'on sert des phô! Il faut importer ce concept en France!!!!
C'est devenu ma 2e cantine apres le Pho Hung.
Conseil : allez y en semaine c'est super relaxant.

Whooot a vietnamese joint in the middle of Church?! Here you will  expect service to be super fast. It's like a fast food except that you order phô! They have to do the same in France!!!
It has become my favorite vietnamese place after Pho Hung.
tip : go during the week, it's super quiet."}
{"text":"I mean it's not the worst but it's also not that good. It's okay if you're nearby and you only have 30 minutes to eat and you don't want fast food but otherwise this wouldn't be my choice for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I love love love Gingers. The food is so good. The only thing that sucks about this place is that it gets very busy and they dont have enough seating"}
{"text":"This is where I and many other people in my neighbourhood go to eat on a regular basis for mediocre thai food. The service is efficient and the food is not bad. I'll likely continue going to this place on nights that I didn't cook anything."}
{"text":"I become overwhelmed when there are so many things on the menu. When I asked what was good they could only say we do not know what you like. So I ordered the oxtail beef ball soup. She said it would be good. It was not really. It was ok if you like meat cooked to death. Oh yeah meat in restaurants is already dead. Anyway while not  delicious I ate it and....nobody died. Other than the cow in the so so not \"good\" soup."}
{"text":"Got this for dinner through just eat. It came super quick and they payed attention to my comments of no cilantro. No complaints. To start we got the hot and sour soup and the yam+avocado and shrimp+avocado super rolls. The hot and sour soup was a bit light/watery and more sweet than hot, but still good flavour. I'd never had super rolls or cold rolls before so I've nothing to compare them to but they were good too. For mains we got the shrimp, chicken, and beef on rice and the pork vermicelli. Both were good, the meats were flavourful. I'm a big fan of Vietnamese flavours and sauces and this place didn't disappoint, each super roll and each dish came with a separate one, all different and all good."}
{"text":"Not only is this place my favourite pho joint in Toronto, but this location is my favourite location of all the Gingers in the city.

Their Hot and Sour Tofu Noodle soup is heavenly. You can feel its warmth travel through your entire body and after a bowl of it, you're not only full, but you're full of healthy, nutritious and soul-fulfilling soup.

A bowl of this 'heaven in a bowl' goes for $4.99/small or $5.99/large. Trust me when I say that the small is HUGE. I have never ordered a large and anyone that I have ever been with that has, has never been able to finish it.

Tell ya what - start with the small and see what happens ;)"}
{"text":"I don't know, I got a vermicelli bowl and worriedly consumed it for lunch. It didn't seem to be the most popular item - most people went with a pho noodle in soup bowl, but I needed takeout as the place was packed, so I figured I've got to stick with it. Condiments to go are self serve, ask the cashier for lids to the little plastic containers!

Overall the vermicelli was fine. It was a bit overcooked and chopped up, but I can imagine it being a result of lunch rush and using tongs to portion quickly. The fish sauce was quite sweet, there was plenty for the portion of noodle. There were some greens, nothing to write home about, the chicken was very dry - breast and not very flavourful, and the spring rolls were the only pleasant item throughout. Spring rolls contained what tasted like taro and pork, were crispy, and not too heavy or filling. My favourite part of the dish! The rest, I could have lived without.

I'll be back soon to give Ginger a second chance with their pho bowl, but my suspicion is their queue out the door is mostly attributable to their affordable price and a busy workday lunch hour..."}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars because it is what it is and it is always the same and you can count on it for that. Best described as \"cheap and cheerful\". The food always looks and tastes the same.  The service never changes with the exception it gets better as they get to know you and the hygiene always looks questionable but I haven't heard of anyone dying yet so it must be ok.  I've gotten to like this place a lot just for its tasty food, good personalized service and friendly staff (love the mother). For a meal under $10, it is difficult to walk away unhappy."}
{"text":"Arrived in town late and noticed Ginger on the way to my hotel. Luckily they're open late! Had a fresh shrimp roll and the taste beef and beef ball soup... so tasty!!"}
{"text":"I miss the old Second Cup that used to be here, but I have to say, the Ginger restaurant that took its place has become a favourite for a quick bite to eat.

If you like shrimp rolls, you can't beat the ones here, cheap at $1.50 per roll and bursting with good quality shrimp in a light, crisp wrapper. 

The baguettes are also a good deal, very high quality for the price.  My fave is the beef baguette, loaded with tender beef and a traditional mix of vegetables and condiments on a fresh, chewy baguette.  The beef is served up in a very tasty sauce and the serving is generous for the price of $2.95.  The only issue I've ever had is the baguettes are so popular, they sometimes run out.  But I guess that is the price of success."}
{"text":"This is a great little Vietnamese restaurant on Church Street.

I had the beef  skewers on pad thai, which was quite flavourful. I really liked how the beef was prepared and the little salad that comes with it was great. The pad thai itself was decent. With a drink it was under $9, which is a great deal for the area.

The atmosphere is very cafeteria like (you order at the front and then they bring it to your table), but it's a great place to hang out over lunch.

I'd get there fairly early around lunchtime since it can be quite busy."}
{"text":"I much prefer the Ginger on Church street. This place is just too crowded and noisy to be a good lunch option.

I didn't like the food as much either. I had the Grilled Chicken & Pork Chop on Steamed Rice, and it was pretty bland. I guess it's a good deal for the price and all, but it's nothing more than a cheap lunch.

I will say the counter service and food preparation was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Ginger has being doing essentially the same thing since I first started working in the city 10 years back; cheap, flavourful Vietnamese food, and, if you're fair about what you're buying, it's doing it really well. 

First up, this joint is really, really inexpensive; the banh mi are big enough for  lunch (and delicious) and will set you back only $4.50 before tax, and most plates are $6-9 and hardly small, if heavy on the rice. 

Second, there's plenty to choose from and it will show up almost immediately. Ginger has a long menu of simple, flavourful items (and hilariously understaged, accurate photos of said items all over the walls), and your food will come out in less than 5 minutes most of the time. Sometimes much less. It's astounding, really. 

Third, it's mostly really tasty. Sometimes it's just ok. But the \"best ofs\" (banh mi, anything involving bok choy and the pho, in my books) are all solid choices.

However, you do get what you pay for. The place is a cafeteria style joint more akin to an unkempt trading floor during prime meal hours, and expect to be dismissed pretty swiftly by an overworked cashier if you ask for any even remotely complicated sounding substitutions. 

But, I mean, let's focus here. 5-10 dollars, 5-10 minutes, 90% chance of tasty. Calm down. It's really a pretty good thing."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful Vietnamese in the heart of the Gay village. We came on Halloween night so we could get both dinner and a show. The place was rammed to the rafters but the food still came within 5 minutes of ordering it. My friend got the pho and I got the vermicelli beef. It was okay but I found the beef a bit stringy. . Not the best I've had but at least everything else was fresh and I could add hosin and spice."}
{"text":"Gingers has grown on me. Its service is very fast and the food is consistently good. It's not the best Vietnamese food in the city but really good in a pinch. Lots of menu items and the food is very quick to come out. Sometimes it's even faster to come here than the Mac dos next door"}
{"text":"This is not your date night go-to place, but it's a great place for an economical tasty meal. 

I've had the tamarind tofu noodles and am in love. Most places in Toronto really skimp on the tofu, which seems so silly to me because it's so cheap compared to meat. But this is not \"most places\". You get a healthy portion of tofu, comparable to the amount of meat you would find in carnivores' dishes. The tamarind sauce is perfect for me--a beautifully balanced tang. And the price is around $6, which is a steal considering that's what my Starbucks coffee order costs."}
{"text":"Went there and got food poisoning so already not a big fan. Overall quality of noodles and beef was not that good. Pho Hung is a better option when looking for pho in Toronto by far."}
{"text":"This is the shining star pout of all the Ginger restaurants, it;s sad because there is zero consistency between the 3 or 4 of them, this specific location produces amazing food, it's beautifully assembled, perfectly cooked, and fair servings, The Baguettes are so damn delicious, their PHO isn't bad either but I've had better, but their bun dishes are really super tasty. I love this place, really fresh, fast and healthy food, again i hope the owners read this because they would be far more successful if they could copy what they have going at their church street locale, they really care about what they are serving there and it shows. I'd stay away from the rest of them though, especially the one near the Eatons centre."}
{"text":"I love ginger! Quality eats for cheap! U get a very good a for your buck and it's  fast and delicious . They're everywhere and definitely worth a try! You have a variety of options so everyone's bound to be pleased. Of our a meat eater like myself id choose option 55 ginger chicken with beef and rice - it's bound to be a success!"}
{"text":"First time at this Ginger location. I ordered the usual Green Curry Beef with Pad Thai. Let me tell you there was no green curry. There was something green placed on top of the beef but it wasn't green curry. The Pad Thai!? I don't thing the cook ever tasted one. It was just noodles mixed with hot sauce. They put the chain to shame."}
{"text":"This is where vietnamese food will always be in my good books... Ginger. This place is normally busy but the food never suffers. Ginger has the best chicken spring rolls, hands down. I normally get the spicy Tamrind chicken udon noodle, its too good. I dont exactly remember the # of each entreé I have tried but everythings delicious. It was my go to place when I did not want to cook :)"}
{"text":"Love the banh mis here loool

I don't get anything else.. They recently changed the bread though!"}
{"text":"I had pho here recently and found it to be better than other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. My girlfriend had the crispy shrimp rolls and they were hot and fresh. Pricing is on the cheaper side, cleanliness could be better. But I believe this place deserves 4 stars because of the above average food quality at a fast food price."}
{"text":"Looks like everyone has mixed feelings about Ginger, but I know how I feel about this joint.

It's cheap cheap! And good!

I've only gone to this location and feedback from friends tell me this is the best one.

Want a quick, filling, tasty meal (appetizer & main) for less than $10? Then go to Ginger!

In the other reviews some criticize that Ginger's food is bland, but here's a tip. ORDER IT SPICY. Realistically, it won't be spicy, but when ordered spicy, their food becomes flavourful and it's good.

Order the vietnamese subs. Have you tried a vietnamese sub? It's delish. Try their \"spicy\" shrimp with rice. Try their \"spicy\" chicken with rice. Try their fruit shakes.

Quick, filling, tasty, cheap and good."}
{"text":"Decent place to get some Vietnamese cuisine. The service is quick, the food is good, and the prices are cheap. The Vietnamese Iced coffee was sooo good."}
{"text":"No Ac but it aight. Good food per dollar. *thumbs up"}
{"text":"The one thing I get at Ginger is their simple and cheap salad rolls (1.99 each). My favorite cold rolls in the neighborhood are at Real Thailand down the road, but Ginger is in a different category, that of the fast counter variety. For prices this cheap it isn't worth it to buy the ingredients and take the effort to make it yourself at home. A quick, no-frills summer meal = 3 of these rolls with accompanying sauce. Each long roll is cut into 4 pieces and so you end up with 12 big bites of three varieties. I like the jicama, tofu & avocado (or yam & avocado) and shrimp. There could be more herbs in these rolls but for this price, I can't really complain."}
{"text":"One word- Wow!

I moved to the area around 3 years ago and wow. Friendly service, Clean, fast, fresh tasting and greatly priced! The younger staff may get confuse and mix up orders but are quick to fix their mistakes.

Everyone need to try this place. Remember, not all the ginger restaurants are the same."}
{"text":"Cheap and not best tasting.
Usually get stomachaches after their pho"}
{"text":"Cheap eats!

If you want meat and rice then this is the place - also if you ask for noodles instead you can do that too ;-)

Try the Vietnamese sub. It's SO good.

The Pho is good if your looking for the flavour and experience. It's a great broth, just lacking in toppings. The beef for the rare beef pho is disgustingly fatty with little actual meat. 

Cheap drink and keep beer!

All in all, its fast, its easy, and its worth standing in line (it goes by faster then you think!). Don't expect quality."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese cuisine. Pho was mind blowing. Hot and rich in taste, healthy food filled with protein perfect for the cold weather outside"}
{"text":"Yo haters! 
This place has a constant line up, the food is dirty and tasty... and cheap! (what do you expect? It's on Yonge St after all)

Their vermicelli with grilled pork and spring roll - #29 is delicious. If you pay cash and buy a pop, you get a 10% discount which brings the total to $9.19.

A great 'go-to' place for a quick pick up for lunch."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Tasty food, but not the cleanest environment. Been recently renovated. It's good that they have windows in the summer that open wide because the smell of the food does get a bit intense! Good food for reasonable prices"}
{"text":"on church street i wouldn't expect cafetaria style service so i was a little surprised but we were in a hurry for lunch so it worked out fine.  as with any cafeteria style place you expect it to be cheap but you never know if it will taste good.  so i was really surprised how good the food was here.  we ordered lemon grass chicken, charcoal beef, and veg pad thai.  the chicken was very good, great sauce.  the beef was thinly sliced short ribs grilled perfectly and the marinade was great.  the pad thai was good but a little too sweet.  

overall they really do a great job of preparing it fast, tasting good, and keeping it inexpensive.  good place for a causal meal with friends or family."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Gingers. Which is not saying much since most Gingers tend to look like dives. 

Regardless of that, most Gingers, whether old or recently opened tend to be busy most of the time, particularly around lunch time. 

I have been going to Ginger for years and you will be surprised but not all Gingers are equal. For example this location offers a better pho --in my opinion-- than the one at the corner of Carlton and Parliament. Maybe it was the flavour in the broth but I rather have this location's than than the latter.  

Now I do not know if this is because this location is in Boytown or not but it is definitely better looking inside with a mild industrial theme, a vespa near the entrance and an actual bar. Yeah, an actual bar. 

As for me, I am just a fan of the pho and that is why I go. I have noticed though that Ginger's servings have gotten a tad smaller from a few years ago so I that is about my only \"Beef with Ginger.\"

But it is cheap and fast Vietnamese soup which normally hits the spot, specially when on the go. Good place."}
{"text":"Cheap & delicious! 
Whenever I want quick food and don't want to guilt myself for eating out I pop into Ginger. 
The one in the Annex is nice because it's MUCH cleaner than some of the other, older, locations. 
Quick
Cheap
Delicious

I personally love the avocado and crispy tofu salad roll and my all-time favourite menu item is of course the $3.10 tofu sub. Mmmm, mmmm, mmmmmmmmm.....
can't beat it. 
Not to mention there's free water (with or without lemons) while you wait. 

*Highly* recommend it!"}
{"text":"gave this place another chance. 
they updated their menu - more options and also better look of the menu folder itself.
haven't had any issues with the food anymore. the service was way quicker and I liked it better this time."}
{"text":"For me there is only one reason to keep coming back here: Pho. 

It is not the best and in fact, it has sort of been getting worse over the last couple of years, getting some more hints of MSGs,  their meat seems to be fattier than it was before and the price has gone up a few cents. However,

A-) It is cheap
B-) It is cheap
C-) I live 5 minutes walk from this location. 

Sometimes convenience will make you do silly things. As exhibit A I will submit the entire 'convenience store' industry as proof that people will buy something not because it is the best (or cheapest) out of sheer convenience.

The decour is hideous tropical colours and this place is next to the Brass Rail, plus a few office buildings so this location is generally always busy. However it does have large windows if you want to do a little people watching while having your pho. Although coming here by yourself it is outright depressing. So I recommend against it. 

For the most part, I have not come here as much as used to as I have migrated my yearnings towards Pork Bone Soup than Pho, but I will still pop in here if I am hungry, have a few minutes to kill and feel an oncoming pho relapse. Most of their other dishes seem too generic to catch my attention. 

As always, Ginger  is best left for locals, relapsing pho-addicts, cheap artists and ass-broke students. 

I simply cannot imagine anyone trekking here for any of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I'm 100% loving this place.  It's clean, it's cheap and it is tasty.  it's not amazing tasty, but you put it together with cheap and clean and it's good enough for 4 stars for me.

It's a bit of an unlikely place for the village but I tried it today with a friend and it hit the spot.  
You go in and order at the counter, they give you a number you take with you to the table and then they will serve it to you- VERY quickly.

I ordered the shrimp cold rolls, my absolute fave and only order at viet places.  and it was so cheap and nicely done that I just kept going back to the counter to order more- I ended up going back for more so many times we had 4 numbers on the table when I left!

I like this place because you can sit around and have a long conversation, or just grab a quick bite alone.  The type of service makes it really easy to do any type of meal you want and did I say it was cheap?

Had this place been in a different area I migt not have given it 4 stars.  But I like how its the different one in the village and neither a full serviced sit-down meal nor a quick standing shawarma/hot dog meal either. tough to get that convenience in the village.

yay.  i'm a fan."}
{"text":"I have dinner here with my uncle about once a month, because it's conveniently located, predictable, and cheap.

Most of the stuff I've had here tastes basically the same, but I tend towards beef or shrimp noodles dishes, so that's more my fault. I haven't tried any of the soups. My uncle always gets a tofu dish that comes with a bunch of crispy business of a garnish on top. They recently switched up all the numbers so I can't be more specific than that.

Everything comes up crazy fast and like I said, it's completely consistent, so it's the perfect place to have dinner when we're both pretty short on time. When the garage doors on the facade are open in the summer, it can actually be quite nice there.

Lots of free parking on nearby sidestreets."}
{"text":"Easily the cheapest and best-for-price value in the neighbourhood.  Food is solidly the same quality every time I come (and order the same thing).  Staff is efficient and friendly.  Lots of room for sitting and they do take-out and delivery (with a minimum charge).  I lean towards the Vietnamese dishes here - it's not my Thai go-to.  But always a good reliable option in the village."}
{"text":"Sweet deal, bros. I went last night and got the large chicken pho, crispy chicken roll and ginger ale to wash it down. My wife got small chicken pho, which was very similar in size. Deal alert! 

The pho was delicious - tender breast chicken, wonderfully flavoursome broth, and a generous portion of rice noodles. I added some hot sauce for an extra kick.

The interior was surprisingly spacious, and gets the job done. Service is efficient. They also have beer. I like beer."}
{"text":"Get your quick fix of some good Vietnamese food here near all the shopping near Bloor Street West. $5-7 gets you a nice entree and its pretty low key and fast food here. Yummm. Lots to do and eat in Toronto, grab a quick meal and keep on shopping and exploring!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant on Ubereats. Was half way through my meal when I realized that they added some extra protein, a fried ant to be specific. Very disturbing and disgusting."}
{"text":"A good variety of food available, ranging from rice to pho. I got the chicken, beef, shrimp and spring rolls on rice (#44) for 8.75+tax. Decent serving size. Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant. This is a fast food where you pay at the front, seat yourself, and have the added benefit of having your food brought to you. Keep that in mind if you're going to come here.

The food is very underwhelming and I would say that this place should only be considered if you're stranded for a quick (not even cheap) eat. My boyfriend ordered a beef pho and I ordered a shrimp pad thai and both were lacking in flavour. While the beef slices/shrimp pieces were okay-fresh, overall portion sizes were a tad small and I would argue that foodcourt thai food may taste better. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken vermicelli bowl with a side of spring rolls from Ginger for the first time. Overall, the taste is just average, but I found that the chicken was sliced much thinner compared to other restaurants with the same dish.  The spring rolls on the other hand were decent.  Since the restaurant is very close to my work place, I will probably give their pho dishes a try one day."}
{"text":"Super cheap and a good place to get some decent noodles among all the fake Asian crap in the area. I'm looking at you, Spring Rolls.

Here's the process: you go up, you order, you pay, they give you a ticket, you sit and bring the food to your table. Easy peasy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my papaya salad, mango salad and house salad. They were fresh, and good value. There's plenty of seating in this restaurant, however it does get really cold with the door opening and closing constantly. It would be better to take out your meals. Service isn't the friendliest, but your food comes out quick. My boyfriend ordered some kind of grilled chicken with peanut sauce combo which was oily. The fresh vegetarian roll was mostly vermicelli noodles, not worth the $1.50. The bathroom is also quite dirty."}
{"text":"Chicken phad thai, the chicken was just boiled and had chili flakes on it, it didn't have a pleasant smell either. Beef and rice, beef was burnt and cold, rice was okay, the fried onion and cabbage was drained in veg oil. Place is dirty, floor is nasty and sticky, their kitchen is disgusting, it has health issues to have dark burnt grease all over the stove and floor I believe."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, good price, convenient in general."}
{"text":"This place cannot be called \"Vietnamese\" food. This is wrong! Vietnamese food is a lot better than this. I think they still exist thanks to their location... Worst pho I've ever had and even the coffe is very very bad. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheap food but the quality is not the greatest. The restaurant is a bit dirty too. If the restaurant is clean i probably would not mind the cheap quality food."}
{"text":"I ordered the large beef Pho through feedback and decided to dine in. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was despite the cheap price. Though I personally found the beef to be not as good quality, the soup stock was good and the portion size good for its price. I would definitely come back for a quick pho fix."}
{"text":"Pho is very good for the price, great place to eat on a budget."}
{"text":"How have I never been here before? 

I guess better late than never - it was marvellous! A delicious, hearty, filling dinner for less than $7 is a treat. I really don't have anything bad to say about this place... It exceeded my expectationss

I got the beef pho, well done and it hit the spot. I had a little sip of my friend's vegan pho... and as a non vegan, I would order it! I think next time I will. Lots of flavours and good spot to try new things. And when in doubt, add hot sauce. 

It's not super authentic or out of this world...but a solid meal and hits the spot!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!
Really good Pho! I was very disheartened by the look of the place both from the inside as well as outside but the food is good enough to have made me want to check this place out (along with the good yelp rating). 

Their menu seemed to be very typical for a Vietnamese place and the prices are not too bad either. 

Not the most cozy of locations and I would only come here for a very quick meal and not a place I would take a group of friends to for a dinner out to.

I'm afraid I can't add too much else in to this review, pretty typical place."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea..."}
{"text":"Oh Ginger, great if you're looking for a quick, tasty bite on the north end of the Yonge St Strip, something you can actually order, get, and eat in less than 10 minutes.

I'm a big fan of their Vietnamese Subs (3$) washed down with a devastatingly addictive Avocado Smoothie (3.50-4?) You can actually see them cutting the fruit and mixing the smoothie right there, fresh from the skin."}
{"text":"I've been ordering take-out from Ginger for about 5 months now. The food takes about 10 minutes from order to pickup time, which is great, so it's definitely fast food! I usually order the spicy lemongrass chicken pad thai, which has been mostly consistent throughout the about 20 times I've ordered it. I highly recommend the hot and sour seafood noodle soup for when you're sick (and too lazy too cook)! 

Overall, very good for a quick and cheap bite."}
{"text":"Ginger at Church and Wellesley has, for me, taken the place of the old Second Cup that once occupied its location. The Vietnamese food is great (inexpensive, delivered in abundant servings), with the place's pho and Viet-style coffee (coffee with a layer of condensed milk) sticking out particularly."}
{"text":"It's alright, I didn't find the food to be that great. 

I've had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, the Chicken Vermicelli and the Chili-Beef with rice. The sandwich was really dry and flavourless. Chicken vermicelli was okay, but nothing to rave about. The Chili-beef is meh, beef is tough and the cabbage it came with tasted weird. 

I guess you can't expect too much, but I've had better for the price. And the place looks really dirty as well."}
{"text":"This place is like a home-cafeteria to me. I visit almost twice a week and sometimes even more. The food is not the best of downtown, but it's amazing with that price and quality.
I personally recommend the beef rib on rice and beef bahn mi (bun), you just have to finish it while it's still warm, which apply to basically every hot-served food. I didn't expect much customer service but the staffs are friendly."}
{"text":"Offering bland, watered down dishes of popular Thai and Vietnamese food, this location is ideally located at the very popular intersection of Church and Wellesley Streets. Besides having average soups and salad rolls, the food is bland, lacks flavor and the dull decor contributes to my rating of two stars for this eatery. The restaurant feels more like a fast food version of Asian food than a typical sit-down, casual restaurant that offers diners time to dine and socialize."}
{"text":"Third time I've been here. Place looks much nicer after the renovation.

It is mostly self serve after you place your order, except that staff brings dishes to your table. For a mere $7.25, the pho came out hot and delicious.

I don't think I will make a special trip to Ginger but will definitely go back when I am in the Village."}
{"text":"My classmate brought me here today. Funny that I never went here last summer when I was doing internship nearby. However I did go to the one on Church St very long ago. All I can remember was that I wasn't that blown away by the food taste and cleanliness back then.

As for this location it is smaller (not ideal for groups) and has a strange layout (I forgot to take photos but if you go here you should know what I am talking about) but I can get past that. I only ordered some dessert and my classmate ordered a chicken dish. It was kinda overpriced but he seemed to enjoy it.

I am under the impression that Ginger is a fast food type of Viet restaurant; it does a good job of satiating your fix of Vietnamese food when you are in this part of downtown. I saw quite a few customers enter the restaurant and place their (takeout) orders as I was waiting for mine. I give it three star for what it is even though I am still not a fan."}
{"text":"My favorite vermicelli dish in Toronto. Amazing crispy chicken spring rolls and cheap prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It wasn't very good. I had a regular pho. The noodles were sort of hard and not quite cooked. The soup was sort of flavorless. The rest was pretty mediocre. I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I need some of Ginger right now in this snowy weather!!!  No, peeps, I meant the restaurant, not some random person named Ginger.

Well, there's two Ginger's close to where I work (Yonge/Bloor and Church/Wellesley).  They are both good for cheap, greasy Vietnamese food.  I like the banh mi's, and the pho at both places.  So if that's what you are looking for, you can't go wrong. 

Here's the diff b/w the two places though:

Yonge/Bloor - seems to tastes better, more authentic and faster service, despite longer lineups.  

Church/Wellesley - cleaner, but slower service.  

So your choice...."}
{"text":"I liked this place. They had a pretty good vegetarian selection, and the people were pretty nice. I was pretty mich looking for something new and I found this place kind of randomly. The way this place works is that you order up front, they give you a number and they bring you food to you. The service is really rather quick, and they did a good job of keeping our orders straight and together. I ordered a tofu dish, and the tofu turned out to be cooked well, a lot of places screw up tofu, but these guys did it very well. 

I think given the opportunity I would go back in the future."}
{"text":"If your stomach is eating itself, you are in a hurry, and you are located in the area, there is no doubt that you'll find a quick fix in this busy spot.

The crew at Ginger is ninja fast. The 3 times I have ordered take out, my food has been ready in less that 15 min (yei!!).

The prices are very affordable, the quality of the meat is zero rubbishy, with an adequate portion of rice/noodles, crunchy veggies, and plenty of sauces.

Their phó has resuscitated me twice! The broth is aromatic, not oily; it tastes balanced.

I've noticed that lots of people eat by themselves looking at the busy&entertaining/crazy Yonge street. I will do it shortly too."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken pad thai was super fresh, reasonably priced and tasty. Their veggie roll was so oily and strange. A huge miss. Couldn't feed it to my dog. Stay with the Vietnamese cuisine. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I had the curry chicken and grilled beef with rice for $7.25.  

The lineups are very long for this place, but don't let that intimidate you as you will be in and out of there in 15 minutes at the very most (even if it's lined up outside).  

The chicken was kind of dry, but it tasted fresh.  The beef had a great flavour to it and my only complaint is that it was a bit greasy. Rice is rice.  Overall, a decent deal for the money.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome quick food at incredibly low prices. Crowded, hard to find a table. Great for takeout or a fast lunch."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I think a lot of the haters of this place are just urban hipsters who can't jive with the fact that this is a chain of sorts, thus in their eyes, it can't strive to be the 'quaint, authentic, ethnic experience' they want.

Pho is run-of-the-mill 3-star fare, but perfectly acceptable.  Pork vermicelli is my go-to though and consistently yummy.  Don't be shy to ask for extra veggies/greens.

Also, through experience, I have found that the Church location is almost always a better bet than the adjacent Yonge shop."}
{"text":"Talk about a bang for your buck! I have been to few of their locations, never a disappointment. But don't expect much of service, you are paying 6-7 bucks for meal specially  in 2013. Instead, when I go there I end up giving them service.  Usually the person at the register looks really unhappy, so I smile and ask them how they are. I'm lucky if I get a response. 

What can I say, I am a sucker for the spicy grilled chicken and crispy chicken rolls (and cheap food:-)."}
{"text":"I use to love this place. The staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is nice, however, since their renovation the food quality seems to have sunk. I've gone twice now, and ordered the # 47. They now switched the grilled chicken to this new, cheaper, flaked chicken. I'm certain it's canned chicken because it's chunks that crumble into flakes.
The first time I thought perhaps they ran out and had to substitute, but the same second time.
So disappointed. Oh well. :-("}
{"text":"I feel like I've wasted my entire life not knowing about this place. I've worked in the area for over a year and always thought Ginger looked too sketchy to warrant a stop. My manager was raving about it the other day so I gave in and went for lunch. I was feeling shy about unknown meat so I played vegetarian. I got the veg banh mi, veg crispy roll, and a durian smoothie. I LOVE DURIAN. I was sold on the place as soon as I saw that on the menu. 

The sandwich was made on very soft bread. The tofu was nicely seasoned. The whole sandwich was warm unlike other places I've had tofu banh mi. It was really nice to have the wonderful flavors but not break my jaw trying to chew it. The crispy roll is a spring roll. It's very tasty but has this strange way of sticking to the teeth. The smoothie was so sweet and creamy and had a nice durian funk.

I'm already planning my return to try just about everything else on the menu. The prices are super cheap. Minus one star only because the place is seriously dirty but I guess it's hard to stay totally clean when the place is that busy."}
{"text":"I had a craving for banh mi and this was the closest place to my work.

I ordered via Ritual and they accepted the order and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes - it ended up taking 28 minutes. There must've been some internal miscommunication among the restaurant staff, as I could hear them yelling at each other in Vietnamese in the kitchen at the back.

As previous reviews have stated, the owner is a short-haired Viet lady, and indeed, she's very rude. There were a few groups of students who ordered and she found a way to give them a hard time.

The viet deli banh mi was shitty. The bread they used was half the size of a normal banh mi and they used half the ingredients. The deli slices they used didn't taste too fresh either.

The only thing impressive about this place is their ability to screw up something as simple as banh mi."}
{"text":"Definitely don't expect much from this place. It's cheap for Toronto standards but it's just mediocre food. No AC on a super hot day so eating a bowl of pho in 30 degree weather is not the best... also don't expect any kind of service. You just order and pick up your food and do everything yourself. A nice change from fast food chains like mcdonalds though."}
{"text":"Pad Thai tasted like instant noodles and cheap ketchup and left an oil slick in my mouth. The chicken was like shoe leather. The best thing about the meal was the cabbage slaw (which had no dressing). You get what you pay for I guess. Never again."}
{"text":"I've seen a few locations but never got a change to visit till now.  Decent portions at an affordable price.  

Ordered the hot and sour shrimp soup.  Not a fan of celery, tomatoes, or mushroom but once I got past that, it was quite yummy to say the least.  

Alongside the soup I also ordered a taro bubble tea and curry lamb with rice.  

The bubble tea was somewhat lacking in flavour as compared to many others I've tried throughout the city.  

I am giving this restaurant 3 stars based on the fact that the curry lamb (though I needed to add extra crushed chilli peppers to suit my palate...) Was indeed cooked to perfection.  Very tender.  Simply delish with its natural flavour.  I am just getting addicted to curry flavour at this present time, so this can only be the beginning."}
{"text":"We had a craving for pho after exams and the closest pho place in the downtown core was this one. As well, Ginger's had a good rap for pho so we decided to check it out. 

If you're hungry, don't order the small.

2 star service
2 star noodle + broth
1 star beef. This beef was just ordinary beef, not the special pho-style slices you get in authentic restaurants!

The large beef pho ($7.50) that we ordered was probably the most boring pho with the least amount of ingredients ever. Never coming back again. I guess the hype was wrong about this place - or at least, this branch lets the franchise down.

As well, it's a pretty cramped place, so don't bring large groups here. In fact, just save face and don't bring anyone here at all."}
{"text":"I've been to this place so many times in the past few years for lunch. Great take and go place for Pho - only problem is the space. Not enough room to sit and eat with friends or co-workers."}
{"text":"I had the green curry beef on pad thai. Yummy lemongrass, coconut milk deliciousness, and for $6.50... how can you beat that? The guy at the counter was super nice too. I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite \"cheap eats\" place in this area.

I love that for $6.75 you can order a your choice of variety of meats (I usually go with the curry chicken) on top of your choice of grain (pad thai noodles and fried vermicelli being my faves, but rice, udon noodle, and something else I'm forgetting available as well). And while the banh mi is mediocre, my friend was obsessed with the cold rolls, and I have to say the butter chicken was actually really good as well!"}
{"text":"A cheap and adequately satisfying lunch. 
We're not talking about anything really impressive or unique, but for $7 to get a plate of decent pad thai noodles with some big chunks of curried chicken on top, I was perfectly happy, and suspect that I will return at some point."}
{"text":"Love this place!

I come here all the time whenever I'm in the village in the day time.

Food is super super super cheap with huge portions!

The bubble tea is actually really delicious.

The crispy spring rolls are amazing.

I've found their salad rolls to be a tad bit dry.

Everything here is so cheap and so filling and really good.

THe Banh Mi's are like 3.50

Get 1, or 2, or 7.

I gets really packed in the daytime..be prepared to share a table if needed! 


Also, lots of great eye candy around...stare onto the street..or alot walks in too..."}
{"text":"This is a quick go-to place for solid thai-viet food.  I also think it's better than the queen street location in consistency of the dish and taste.  Highly recommended.

Food: 4/5, I often get the vermicelli with beef, some rice dish or the bahn mi. Their pho is questionable though.  I've come here often to know the consistently good food here. Anything pork or beef or lemongrass is usually a good choice.  The pho broth is not as great and the chicken or curry is very \"instant-food\" tasting and not very restaurant quality. Most of the food here is however great.  I would say this location and the one on yonge/bloor are the good ones in Toronto.

Service: 3/5, not much here and I have lucked out on getting my food on time and the right dish (knock on wood) but many have also experienced their order not going in.

Ambience: 3/5, great for dinner; easy-going place with moderate seats and nice during the evening when they open the windows.

Price: 4/5, very affordable around $10-15 per person."}
{"text":"Another cheap n' cheerful choice on Yonge Street. I can only comment on the Pho -- which, although it wasn't the best pho I've ever had, was pretty decent. My rare beef and meat ball pho came with lots of meat, though I found the broth to be a bit bland. They totally water down the hoisin sauce, though, so it's thin and runny. Not good. On the up side, food came out super quick and I was in and out in less than half an hour. Don't make Ginger a destination, but if you need cheap, quick eats in the area it's a pretty good bet."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of options and reasonable pricing. I tried ginger last week and ended up going three days in a row for lunch. However, soups are little expensive for my liking. I work around the corner and looks like I am going to be a regular."}
{"text":"The pho at this location is much worse than the nearby Church Street location. The beef was cut too thick and was really fatty. Their hoisin sauce was watered down into a liquid. I'm going to stick to the Church location from now on. (Although I might return here for a Melona bar...)"}
{"text":"I've visited several of their locations and this one is by far the weakest. Other locations are typically known for getting good value. Unfortunately, this location is overpriced and the portions are really small.

First visit, I ordered a regular Pho which was served in a tiny bowl and contained broth, noodles, and some beansprouts, thats it. I gave them a second chance, and tried their butter chicken roti (yes, I dun goofed ordering roti at a Vietnamese place) and it was not only small, but contained half potatoes, and a handful of \"butter chicken\".

Unimpressed. Stay away."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place so much. Ever since I first tried Vietnamese food I was stuck, It's simple and the flavours are clear and distinct and basic. When I moved to Toronto I wanted to find a cheap and cheerful Vietnamese place to satisfying my endless cravings. Well, Ginger is it. 

This location is especially popular and every time I go in here, there is a lineup. However, the guys behind the counters are masterful Asian magicians and move so quickly! I've never waited long for my food even if there were people out the door. 

I always order the same thing - three cold shrimp spring rolls (the sauce is just so yummy) and the pork vermicelli. It comes with fried pork, thin rice noodles, shredded lettuce, mint, carrot and coriander and its topped off with this sweet vinegar sauce and a deep friend pork spring roll. It is absolutely delicious and all of this cost me $9!  An appetizer and a main course for less than $10. You cant go wrong with that.

If you haven't had Vietnamese food, go to Ginger and prepare to get hooked!"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, and filling. I love their fried spring rolls.

I was suspicious at first and thought I might get food poisoning. Alas, it's all good folks!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad here. A bit rushed to be honest. The pho is relatively cheap and pretty decent. The curries are nothing to write about. And the cold rolls aren't really that cold which kind of makes them hard to eat. If you want a fast hot meal go with the rare beef pho soup."}
{"text":"I was here briefly for takeout lunch. I ordered a chicken and papaya salad and a shrimp roll. There was a good amount of chicken (non-greasy) and green/white papaya? Is that a thing? There was some thai basil, shredded carrots, peanuts and that tangy-sweet dressing too. And it came with shrimp crackers (3). The shrimp spring roll was yummy too. 

I am giving this place 3 stars because they put dressing in my salad, and the takeout box in a plastic bag and of course the dressing dripped everywhere (the takeout box wasn't one of those sealed kinds). Thank goodness the shrimp came with a litttle container of dressing?

I would come here again to try something different (my coworker always gets their \"ginger sandwiches\" which sounds like a banh mi to me), maybe even sit in. The seating and decor is really casual. But the prices and portions seem decent!"}
{"text":"If you want something quick, easy,delicious come here. Perfect location for any lunch or dinner when you're in a rush but still want some good food."}
{"text":"Their delivery is crappy.  I've been waiting for an hour and a half now and still waiting.  I gave them a call already but obviously it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Decided to try out the pho here since hearing some good reviews. You have to pay first and then the waiter brings you your food to your table. I got my pho 5 minutes after I ordered. It looked pretty good. There was lots of meat and the right amount of noodles for a small size. The noodles were hard and should have been cooked longer. The soup was more salty than I expected. It's a cheap place to go to with quick service if you're ever in a rush."}
{"text":"I've been to a few gingers in Toronto, but this is the ONE. 

The service has always been very friendly and I've never ran into any problem. However, we are here to talk about the food! I seem to eat the same items on repeat, but I honestly never get bored with my choice. I would recommend that you pay for extra meat since it's totally worth it. 

I usually eat the chicken teriyaki on rice or the hot & sour vegetable soup. I'd 100% recommend these dishes since they've grown to be my comfort food. The soup is amazing if you're feeling sick or hungover, which is why I ordered it today for deliver! 

I've ordered deliver like 100 times and I'll continue to do so 100 times more."}
{"text":"Always a good choice for inexpensive, tasty fast food.  Service is efficient, neither rude, but certainly not friendly.  I always leave satisfied with my food and the experience always meets my expectations."}
{"text":"After my travels to Vietnam, I was so excited to try this place. The beef sandwich is delicious and it's only $3.95! Bread is always fresh and the beef is so flavorful."}
{"text":"Used to be good, but the amount of meat they put into the meals has gotten way too small. Ordered chicken and rice, the chicken breast was so thin it fitted in between the space in a fork. Not much veggies either. 
Service is horrible!
Also last time I visited I got serious food poisoning after eating there.
Someone else I know had same problem..
The hygiene in general is low, everything is sticky, big time.
Ginger no more! ( shame as was good once)"}
{"text":"I can't add too much to the discussion - everyone agrees. They are super fast and the food is good.

The lunch specials are a great deal - big portions and delicious taste at reasonable prices.

It may seem a little overwhelming at lunchtime with the multiple lines of people, but trust me, they move fast. Look at the list up high, choose your number, and order. Once you've ordered and paid, they'll give you another number and tell you to wait. The wait won't be long. If you are dining in, someone brings your food directly to your table, and if it's to go, you'll be served at the counter.

Fast, efficient and tasty.  Recommend: pho, chicken curry."}
{"text":"By far the nicest ginger location, I actually walk past the one on Yonge near Bloor to go to this one a few blocks south. 

I like that it's cleaner and serves passionfruit juice... Actually I'm not sure if the one on Yonge serves passionfruit juice too.

I like the vermicelli with chicken & spring roll, though I've also had the pork. I found the pork to be a bit fatty where as the chicken uses white meat. I've had better spring rolls and I tried both the chicken and veg but for the price point ($6.95) I'm still giving it 4 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Good eats at a great price and extremely fast service. Always do takeout at the place can get pretty rammed at lunch time. There's a good reason it gets so busy. Recommend the crispy spring roll. My go to mean is the chick, beef, shrimp and spring roll on rice. Udon chicken is great if you feel like indulging. Can't go wrong with the rare pho or virmecceli. Pretty big selection. Keep in mind that this is more of a fast grab joint and not a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and affordable. My favourite is the vermicelli with grilled chicken. So fresh with some salad and a spring roll. Quick service too."}
{"text":"S'ok, I guess.. Had the chicken banh mi and chicken crispy roll.  The roll was pretty nice, but the banh mi was just some dry grilled chicken on a bun with the usual banh mi fixings.  Not too inspiring, but hey for $4 you can't go wrong, right?  The pad thai also was a little odd - with plain seasoned noodles topped with a flat fried hunk of chicken.  A good place to fill the hunger gap on a budget, but I doubt I'll be back - I've had better for the price elsewhere."}
{"text":"great food, great prices, served to you! i usually eat there at lunch or in the evening. my favourite dish would be the curry chicken and teriyaki beef on rice. number 50 something on the menu. amazing. their pho is alright though, but i can't complain with such low prices. you can also serve yourself as much spice or lemon or any other sauce you want. the interior could use some work as it looks like a kind of shabby place, but i always see a lot of customers there anyway. not too bad, but love the food the most!"}
{"text":"Fast service, great variety of Vietnamese food. If you want a quick bite in exam period, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick Asian meal! Must try the coconut shrimp, it's delicious!! The pork and pho is decent. I like the interior, very Asian tacky kind lol. The concept is fast food like where you order at the front table and then wait for your food. The prices are great, basically everything is under $9-10."}
{"text":"The food here came so quickly, five minutes!! I had the grilled chicken on rice for about $9 and my sister had the fried fish and mango salad. Both were quick delicious. The chicken was juicy and thinly sliced. The downside was the mango smoothie which tasted like mango tea (very watered down!!!). The woman at the front desk taking our order wasn't friendly but I guess that's why it's a pay and sit down type of establishment."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and filling. I get their Green Curry Tofu a lot, and the quality varies pretty significantly. Sometimes it's delicious, sometimes it's... weird, sometimes spicy, sometimes bland. 

I go when I'm starving and in a rush, but there are a lot of other good options in the neighbourhood if you have a little more time."}
{"text":"In the past few weeks I have been sampling their menu because it is close to my work, so far I can say of all the items i've eaten there I definetly have some favorite meal combos. 

The staff is very friendly and very helpful. the kitchen staff are some of the nicest I have ever met, and I appreciate the quality and hard work they put into their food. 

One of my favorite meals has to be number 28 and The pulled beef and Kimchi sandwich. a great way to reengergize yourself with refreshing tastes and little bit of spice!"}
{"text":"Everytime i want to get quick bite with reasonable price, i always come to Ginger. A lot of variety on the menu, and the service is very quick. In the evenings there are long lineups for take out. But food is very good and come in big portion. Recommand Grilled chicken, beef, shrimp and spring roll on rice."}
{"text":"It's a mix of a fast food and a dine-in restaurant because you pay before you order, but they serve the food to your table and clean up for you. First time here I ordered the Pho, and as I was going to the sit down after I ordered, the food was delivered to my table. I definitely do not recommend the Pho, the soup base just tasted like water. The teriyaki dishes looked alright. You could go if you're looking for a quick large portion meal, but the quality of the food is pretty bad."}
{"text":"I had the chicken curry and bbq beef. It was very yummy. Big portion, I couldn't eat all of it. The rice was a bit greasy though."}
{"text":"Ginger is the bomb. It's exactly what it looks like: cheap Vietnamese food that is delicious. Highly recommended are vermicelli bowl with pork and their pho with rare beef and beef balls. Also try their shakes.... half cantaloupe and half mango. I go here regularly and have never had a bad meal or slow service. Call ahead for takeout so you can avoid the crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"Ginger is a love and hate type thing. It is really cheap (full meal for $6-7) but it really is bland. I tried the pork vermicelli and a crispy spring roll and it wasn't anything great. It is cheap though so I can't complain - actually wait - the spring rolls are a rip off. They are a good 4 - 5 inches long but 3-4 inches of it is just the roll.. there's nothing in it! I got the shrimp spring roll and there were 2 tiny pieces of shrimp in the middle and that was it... good thing I only ordered one.

The food though is filling and super cheap but you can't really expect much for this price."}
{"text":"maybe the WORST of the GINGER restaurants (Parliament an equal/close 2nd)...
awful setting/interior, unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"BEST of the GINGER chain..  Nice setting, friendly staff; good quality food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least a 100 times (work close by).
After 2 'significant' CLOSINGS; i'm not talking a city 'warning' (which is bad but a CLOSING is a very bad sign) for cleanliness conditions/rodents/handling of food, etc..  I can't go anymore.  It's always been dirty looking and cramped (inside), at times it was 'endearing'.  Eventually it just becomes GROSS and potentially DANGEROUS to eat here.  Go to GINGER on CHURCH if you want this food, it's a better/smarter option.  AVOID."}
{"text":"Ginger is a staple in the Yonge and Bloor area for a lot of people. The lineups run down the sidewalk at times. This is Vietnamese cuisine with Thai fusion. The service is fast, and you order by the number off the wall and wait for your dish. Seating is limited, and if you get your food to go you'll have to stand around in the way of other diners. The food is decent, and it's cheap. A noodle or rice dish with meat will run you less than $7."}
{"text":"Been working in the area for years now and finally decided to try the food here for lunch. I had a craving for Pho so I decided why not give them a try.

I walked in shortly before noon and it was fairly quiet. The guy at the register was quick to take your order so that he can serve the next person. I didn't expect friendly service so I guess I wasn't all that disappointed that I didn't receive it. Before I could even sit down at a table the waiter came from the back yelling my number because my order was ready. I sat down and he placed my pho and chicken roll in front of me. The soup was quite salty and the chicken roll was greasy and bland. There was no flavour! You have to go to the condiment stand to get your sauces, lime, chillies, spoons, fork/chopsticks. I guess since it's a fast food type place it makes sense you have to get your own stuff. I've just personally always gone to a place where all that stuff is either on your table or served to you with your order. The beef in the pho (rare beef and beef balls) were not so great. The beef balls taste spongy and blank. the rare beef seems to have been pre cooked because it was tough and overcooked... I thought rare was rare but maybe rare is overcooked :s

The place gets super busy after 12pm but the line seems to move quickly. I paid less than $8.00 for everything which was great but it did not satisfy my pho craving."}
{"text":"Well, c'est bon et ça bourre la panse mais on est loin de la grande classe (et c'est correct). 

La nonchalance du staff me fascine - la serveuse a déposé nos assiettes sur la table loin de nous en ne nous regardant pas. 

La bouffe est okay, graisseuse et salée, quantité juste correcte, un ti peu d'épices. Le poulet est sec, le porc est très gras. Le riz n'est pas assaisonné et les nouilles sont... plates. 

C'est un endroit décontracté comme un spot à pizza cheap. Ne vaut pas le détour selon moi mais si vous êtes dans le coin et que vous avez une fringale de soirée, ça fait
le boulot!"}
{"text":"Extremely underrated. Great flavor and range of choices. Fresh rolls and meat for cheap price. Its hard to imagine such a place exists in downtown core. The only complaint is the dirty plastic chopsticks , but they provide one time wooden ones so that's fine."}
{"text":"Pretty decent vietnamese food. I got a vermicelli bowl (with tofu) and my boyfriend got beef pho. According to him it was pretty good (better than expected) - he really liked the broth. I enjoyed my vermicelli, the tofu was nice and firm. The only thing is that the place could be a little cleaner. You have to go and get the sauces, which are in large containers and you have to scoop it into a little bowl...kind of unhygienic."}
{"text":"Pad thai wasn't even properly made (it tasted like the sauce was mostly ketchup), but then again, this is definitely not a 5 star restaurant. Good for a quick, cheap meal"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for some time now and I finally got the chance to a few nights ago! Woo!

I came here for dinner with a friend of mine just after finishing up some work at the Toronto Reference Library and we were both craving for some good ol' pho. 

We were around the area and I figured we'd hit up Ginger, I mean it's next to a strip club, it's bound to be good right?

Jokes aside, we walked in and was astounded by the way it's set-up. It wasn't like your typical vietnamese restaurant, the idea here is that you order your food, pay for it and then eat it. It speed things up and it's a great way to just go in, eat and come out without having to wait for someone to come and give you the bill, etc and etc.  

The restaurant was tiny, run-down and sketchy looking but that didn't stop me from going in. The price for the food is absolutely amazing. $6.75 for a large pho? SOLD!

So we both ordered the large pho and it came out to us surprisingly fast. We didn't even have to wait 2 minutes. We were kinda skeptical about that but hey, when we're hungry, waiting for a long time for food is a no-no but this place was hella fast.

So we sat there with our pho, I started eating it and it was a little bit lukewarmish. Not sure why but that was a huge let down. Pho ain't pho without pippin' hot broth! The taste was there for sure but without the heat, a little part of me was sad about that.

Overall, ok food at a great price. Pho, fast, cheap and ok good.

I'll definitely be back another day maybe..just maybe the broth will be warmer than lukewarm!"}
{"text":"Edit: It's been a awhile since I went to Ginger. It used to be my go-to place to eat/take out because they were delicious and cheap. I kindda stopped going post-renovation but decided to give it a go, why the hell not? 

Sigh... I wanna like them back so bad because it's so conveniently located. I ordered my used-to-be favourite No. 69 Lemongrass beef on rice.  Meh, it's so bland and almost watered down sauce. Rice was watery as well. 

My bf ordered Green curry on pad thai and it was good but again it tasted like they cheap out on something, something in the curry didn't taste as rich as they used to be. The pad Thai on the other hand was as if it was soaked in vinegar for 500 hours

I don't know, I haven't had a \"oh..yum!\" experience post-renovation."}
{"text":"Ginger on Church and Yonge...

The Good:

- the service is somewhat fast because it does cater to those working around the area
- when done well, the jackfruit shake is super good
- lots of variety...from soups to grilled chicken
- you can call in ahead to save time

The Bad:

- they only fill up the cup 75% of the way!! sometimes even closer to 65%!! (for the jackfruit shake!!!)
- I ordered what i thought was hot and sour soup but it was all noodles and like 2 pieces of chicken!! and nothing like what I thought hot and sour soup was!!
- their Viet pho also was bland and not worth it at all!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having the Pho here. I've been here before for vermicelli, rice dishes and banh mi. 
A bit pricier than Chinatown. My large Beef pho was $7.75+tax. 
This location is convenient and it satisfies my Vietnamese food cravings."}
{"text":"I love the Ginger location  on queen.
Both are fast and flavourful but portion size here is much smaller and honestly it just does not taste as good. 
This doesn't mean you'll get bad food. Not at all. If you've tried the one on queen you'll keep going to that one. It's soooo good and the taste is on point.

The location itself is neat and clean which I absolutely love."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner.  

The first time, I got the chicken lemon grass pad thai.  It was ok.  It's cheap and it filled me up.

The second time, I got shrimp pad thai, I was a bit disappointed.  It was almost flavourless.  

The place is small and they have a variety of what you can order.  I mean, if you need to fill your tummy, you can't go wrong with this place.  I will try their pho next time or other dishes they have, but I think this will not be the place I will hit up again for pad thai."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday for a quick bubble tea around the area. I ordered the honey dew flavour. The bubble tea was good and I definitely liked the tapyoka inside it they tasted fresh and not hard.

The place dose not look so good and it seem a simple old and not renovated area definitely there could be some fixing which make it look better and more visibly attractive. 

Also the service was horrible I did not like the lady working there she was a bit rude. My friend asked her if she can charge her phone and if there is any outlets she can use as her phone was out of charge she said no and walk away in a rude way which we did not like. And I am sure they have some plugs at the back for the machines they use.

For a quick to go bubble tea I think it's a good place to try other wise if you are looking for the company and nice place with good service I would not suggest this place."}
{"text":"If yelp had an option for no stars I would choose that. The worse pho I've ever had. It's suppose to be hot and sour seafood pho. It had one shrimp, two nasty mussels, imitation crab meat, and some other seafood I tasted that was way too chewy. The broth taste like chef boy r d's can spaghetti smh nasty! Never again! Their wings seemed days old and fried way too hard."}
{"text":"Long time fan of this place... its cheap and good. You can't beat a really nice sized plate of food for $5-10 taxes included.
LOVE their fresh rolls... especially the special crab and avocado rolls and the beef rolls. Also love their fried chicken rolls, beef banh mi and mango salads.

I just had their pad thai for the first time in a long time and it tasted like a ketchup bottle so thats why they lose a star. Also the bathrooms needs a good scrubbing but its cheap eats."}
{"text":"I got takeout here a couple weeks ago and it was great! Ordered coconut shrimp with pork chop and rice and a small pho bowl. The coconut shrimp was to die for. That sauce... perfect. The pho was quite small relative to other pho bowls I've ordered and they didn't provide bean sprouts or lime which I found to be odd. I noticed the restaurant seems quite tiny and crammed and seems to be self serve. So I would suggest just going here for takeout and order that coconut shrimp!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last ate here. Good food! Limited space tho. Crowded..Oh oh..and strip club next door! LoL..i love their coconut shrimp and grilled pork chops on a steamed rice, a bit greasy but it is yummy and heavenly!!!"}
{"text":"This place can most aptly be compared to a plain white t-shirt: Although Kanye might disagree, there is a limit to how upscale a t-shirt should get. If you can find a decent one for $5, you'd be happy. How am a I making the connection to Vietnamese food? Because in my opinion, there's only so high end you want to make a Vietnamese restaurant, and that's a compliment. If there's too much attention to the decor then I start to worry there's not enough attention being paid to the soup. 

With Ginger, there's no worry about that. It's speed Vietnamese. They have a cafeteria style line that includes a good high fructose drink selection, and lots of pan Asian style food that's prepared quickly. And it's not bad. But it's not that good either. If you're desperate for pho, it's passable. But it won't make you wax nostalgic for it if you're not right in front of the place. The rolls are pretty good, similar to what really quality Vietnamese places turn out. And the noodle dishes are okay, too. The prices are great. You can get lunch for under $10 pretty easily. But it's all pretty ho-hum. 

Good for lunch. Avoid for dinner"}
{"text":"Dirty, delicious cheap eats. 

The veggie Vietnamese sub rocks my socks.

Springs rolls also do it for me.

Oh! and 3 dollar beer. That ain't bad..."}
{"text":"Location is convenient. Portion is ok. It is interesting that they probably added a lot of ketchup into their Pad Thai. lol. Price is cheap and you even get 10% off (? don't remember the exact discount) if you pay cash. It is a casual restaurant and definitely not a formal dating restaurant but I do come with my wife, in business causal :)"}
{"text":"Come here, make a decision on what you want, and immediately leave to another Viet place. Whatever you want, don't order it here because it's sure to come out worse than expected. The tables were dirty when we arrived and were cleaned only with water nothing else.  I'm usually not one to return food, but I ordered Pad Thai and it was inedible. Had to go back to get another order of something different. When I got the replacement, the pork chops were burnt at the bottom. The same goes for the drinks. The bubble tea doesn't taste real and the bubbles at the bottom were extra small. 10 minutes after the meal my stomach was fighting for its life lol. Although it's cheap, my recommendation is to avoid this place at all costs. 

TLDR: Food = Burnt, Tables= Dirty, Bubble Tea = Underwhelming. Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Jeez, an old favourite from University for being good, cheap food, is still definitely good and very cheap. 

Seriously this is a great place to go for a quick lunch or meal. Expansive menu with a very simplified ordering system. Almost a do it yourself and sit anywhere cafeteria style. Their pho is great and includes non traditional combinations like tender grilled chicken along with house special. Still got that Hanoi style feeling in the dining room with the colours and layout and do it yourself utensils. 

Two meals, very filling large size for under $16.you can't beat that. 

4.5, rounded to 5.0 because great value and taste."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the worst Thai food I've ever had in my life.  They serve a mix of Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese cuisines, so maybe they can do the other ones better.

We had the pad thai which tasted as if they'd used Heinz ketchup and more oil than I ever thought possible to stir fry noodles which subsequently immediately clumped together.  How come something be that oily and still clump together?  We also had an almost inedible chicken dish.

The seating area is gross...tables are sticky.  

BTW, the Ginger chain shows up pretty regularly in the listing of Toronto Dinesafe \"Yellow Cards\"...an indication of food safety infractions.

It's cheap, but it's hard to have good value when you can't finish your food.  Other people seem to like them better, so maybe I'll give them another try sometime and try one of their Vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"Great prices, good food but don't place any expectation on the service or the environment. You're just here for food - for me it's simple pho and delicious bahn mi's. Convenient location on Yonge, just steps away from Ryerson University and Dunas station. I recommend Ginger for a quick Vietnamese bite!"}
{"text":"Ive been to Ginger  a couple of times in my life and I found it quite good. It is very traditional with Vietnamese people cooking Vietnamese Cuisine. I find it one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the Downtown (Yonge and Bloor) area. It seems pretty clean, and you can get pretty much anything you need on the side of the cashier table. I have ordered the Vermicelli noodles with beef and spring rolls, the curry beef and chicken with rice, and last but definitely not least the Rare Beef Pho. The complaints I have about Ginger are that the portions are small and they DO NOT provide Chili Peppers. Anyone who knows me knows I love spicy foods. This obviously made the 5 Star rating change to a 4 Star. I would visit again if I am craving Viet food but not dying of hunger and not feeling for spicy food (both rare cases but possible). Recommended if you are in need of traditional Pho."}
{"text":"SUPER CHEAP. but definitely lower quality as well.

If you want a very quick, very cheap meal, it's pretty reliable.

Expecting more than the bare minimum? You'll probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a classic 6/10 place. You can tell by the vibes that you're not getting gourmet good, but that's all part of the experience. I ate in with a friend and was perfectly happy with the food, and didn't mind the crowd or slightly dirty table. As long as you aren't expecting much, it's a good place to grab a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Price wise this place has a very loyal clientele. The speed is usually not too long and the benefit of a glass of ice cold water is at best a distraction. Fast food Vietnamese with a few Chinese and Thai influences from Egg noodles in chow mein to pad Thai noodles with Vietnamese spring roll and grilled meat. Many choices under ten dollars which is fantastic but With your meal served you will receive more volume than take out. This is my last resort close to home spot because it is consistently in affordability and value."}
{"text":"This place is great!  And I go fairly frequently.  I've concluded based on the wait times that a tip is necessary for take out, which is concerning.  Otherwise, the Pho is delicious and prompt!"}
{"text":"So this is sometimes my go-to place when I want something fresh, cheap and fast - but not fast food.

This is one of 4 or 5 locations. Each has its own distinct and separate decor, but the same menu, ordering and delivery process. This location has a clean green and white interior, you go to the front, look up over the cash at the photos and the signboard, decide what you want, place your order and pay. Then they give you a plastic card with a number on it. You go and help yourself to the ever present water pitcher, slices of lime, paper napkins on the side, and chooose your table. When your food is ready, someone will bring it over to you, fresh and hot. I like this. No worrying about servers etc. It's quick and cheap and tasty, and I ve had worse Vietnamese in the city (that cost more), so good for a quick, inexpensive bite."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since I visited Ginger and my friend wanted to have dinner there. 
This time around I got #67 - The Chicken veggies /w Crispy noodles. 
Very quick service and within 10 minutes we got our food. 

PRESENTATION - It look like congee when it's not suppose to. Usually it is on the dryer side. The chicken pieces are WAY to chunky.
TASTE - Compared to what my friend had (the beef veggies), the chicken was dry and flavorless. And I know its \"fast food\", but the tasted quite \"rushed\". My suggestion - Take your time...it wasn't even busy~ Noodle bowl at Spadina (if you can tolerate their poor air quality due to the heavy smoke) has better taste. 

VERDICT
DATE SPOT - Not exactly a spot to take your date on, unless you're looking for a quick way to leave them. 
LARGE GROUP - If you're uncomfortable with small talks or simply want large gathering to end ASAP (you may dislike or have no interest in knowing people) choose Ginger. 
FAMILY & FRIEND SPOT - Bring those odd family members or ex-friends of yours to guarantee a short and forgettable moment."}
{"text":"I revisited this place after a few years absence.  I visited quite a few times in the first couple of years of this location as the value for money was really good on the noodle & rice dishes. However I stopped being around downtown in recent years and I also noticed the portions being scaled back so I stopped going.

I ordered what I almost always get at this place, the Udon Noodles with Tamarind Chicken. I remember they did this so well, it seemed to belong to a higher class of restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size - as big as the original, maybe bigger.  Sadly the end product wasn't nearly as good as it used to be. The sauce was very runny where as before most of it seemed coat the noodles and meat chunks. Tasted more sour than I remember - not the usual Tamarind sourness, more like a vinager sourness  - it was still OK, but a letdown compared to my memory of this dish,   

Too bad they removed the BBQ Lamb Chop add-on from the menu, those used to be really good and was also a cheap mini-meal to get by itself with steamed rice. I also noticed the once-popular Butter Chicken Wrap has been deleted.

Overall it was a good amount if food for the money, I give them extra credit for being open late (by todays standards anyway) the place is fairly spartan but they go around cleaning all the time.  

I'll be in no hurry to repeat, but I wouldn't be averse to dropping in if again if I'm that area around 10PM and need an inexpensive meal. But next time I'd order something that's easier to get right, like Lemongrass Chicken or Pork on Vermicelli."}
{"text":"So I'm a huge fan of Ginger. I've been to a few of the other locations and yet this was somehow my first visit to this one.

Honestly, I always order the exact same thing when I hit a Ginger (vermicelli with spring roll & grilled beef) and this trip was certainly no exception to that rule.

As is always the case with Ginger, the food arrived within minutes of me ordering it and it was delicious. It was well prepared and assembled, and the various components all worked incredibly well together. This is just a really, really flavorful dish executed almost perfectly.

(My only complaint is a somewhat stingy amount of accompanying fish sauce. This is always my sole complaint, to be fair.)"}
{"text":"My curry chicken was OK,  the mango salad was apparently very tasty.  So hit and miss.  But given how cheap it is,  maybe not bad value."}
{"text":"A Viet beef/pork/chicken bun for less than $4 after tax!  The bun is the only thing Ive tried as for now.  My coworker recommanded this place to me and it was really good.  He goes there 4 days a week for lunch."}
{"text":"Okay for the price.
Bought the large rare beef noodle(9$ w tax) and share with one person for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! Why the low ratings?! If I had read all the crap that people have posted here, I would have skipped it. Thankfully I didn't and just went in with my family --stumbled upon this place while walking from our hotel to the Eaton Centre during our Thanksgiving 2017 trip to Toronto.

This place has no bells and no whistles, but their food is absolutely delicious. I have to say that I consider myself a ph? aficionado and connoisseur, and I have eaten these noodles in a variety of states and countries, and these were DELICIOUS!

Portion was really generous, savory and hot. I devoured the whole thing and felt like a million dollars. My family had other dishes we usually order at other Vietnamese places and they were, according to them, as good as other places we love back home.

Price was right, flavor was great, clean place, service was prompt and courteous. The only odd thing was getting water... there's this little dispenser that takes a while to fill up a cup --and I had to fill 5 cups for my family...

If you have the chance, go here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like set up of Ginger. It's like cafeteria style.  I would order my food at the cashier, and then take a seat and wait for my food to be delivered.  What down side of this method, is that if the restaurant is busy, it's difficult to thoroughly enjoy your meal.  

Large variety of Vietnamese dishes to choose from for reasonable price.  I enjoyed my pho and mom's rice dish.  My pho broth wasn't oily, and was nicely seasoned.  Both our dishes came out fast.

It isn't the cleanest of places.  I'd give it a 2/5 for cleanliness."}
{"text":"unassuming, cheap, quick viet spot, easily accessible by transit.  popped in for a quick bite before going to a show at the masonic temple.  ordered the pork banh mi which was unspectacular but very decent and tasted fresh.  not much else i can say!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the spring rolls here! They are the best I have ever had. This place isn't fancy but it delivers good value and delicious food. It's a great place to go even if you are alone. There isn't a lot of seating for large groups to get takeout if that's an option."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at any of the other Ginger locations.  But I seriously enjoy this place for the quick and cheap food.  If I ever need a quick bite before work, I always eat here.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  

The food kicks ass and is delicious and they have something for just about everyone so you can't go wrong.

Would recommend this to anyone in the Church and Wellesley area."}
{"text":"I live in downtown Toronto for many years now & am always on the lookout for a great meal. If you live in downtown Toronto, then you've probably heard about or seen Ginger. I must confess that Ginger is the only Vietnamese restaurant i've ever been to - but all I can say is that I like it a lot!

   TRY THEIR CHICKEN BAGUETTE SANDWICH !

I doubt that the chicken baguette is very Vietnamese - but if you ever want the perfect snack (for merely $3.50 !!!) , Ginger's chicken baguette is the best you will find. I think in all of downtown this sandwich is the best quality available for such a low price. The Chicken tastes perfect, is not too thick, & is accompanied by salads & dressing / sauces. And the overall taste is simply amazing. Note that some Gingers do not have the baguette for sale - plus if you do not like chicken or are vegetarian, then you can also take the exact same sandwich with tofu instead (tastes just as good - tho I prefer the chicken one). Trust me - once you start getting this sandwich you will get it again and again and again and again... :)

Some other discoveries I've made about the place:

- For a full meal I usually order anything with eggplant. I often eat eggplant from various diff cuisines, & it is hard to get it right. Ginger got it right. The eggplant is very soft & tender & tastes just delicious.

- Avoid the ketchup sauce, unless you are a fan of ketchup on a non-french-fry-meal (I am not as you can tell). The sauce is referred to as tomato sauce, but tastes very ketchupy - though if you ask before ordering your meal you can omit the sauce or exchange it to a dressing.

- The 355 Yonge Street Ginger opened not too long ago & has a very nice glass store front unlike any of the other Gingers, which gives this location an open atmosphere & overall nicer  feel than the other Ginger locations in downtown Toronto.

But yeah - overall I am really impressed with Ginger (especially with their chicken sandwich deal) - so if you ever crave a snack or want to try Vietnamese food that offer delicious eggplant, give Ginger a try."}
{"text":"Food is always good, great for on the go people. Sitting is very limited, table of 4 at most. 

One bad thing! They should definitely re-think of making small size pho dac biet (special)! A large bowl is way too big for one person and it's a hassle and so messy to split it! 

But overall good food and decent service!"}
{"text":"Good prices for location. The rice dishes are not the best, but the Pho is ok. Good place just for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I love it here.  My husband and daughter love it here.  You don't come for the decor, you come for good inexpensive food.  We eat here every day when our daughter is at summer camp at Ryerson."}
{"text":"Taste: 3.5/5 - Sure, I have had better Vietnamese food, but very good for a fast food (?) place. I especially like their beef dishes. 

Value: 5/5 - Can't beat the price. Also, you pay first in the counter, get a number, and they bring you the food. No tips required. 


Service: 5/5 - They bring you the food quickly, provide you with all the stuff you need for your self service, clear your table, and do not require tip. That is exactly what I would expect in a fast food like place. You pick up your own water, utensils, napkins and sauces as needed, which is totally fine with me. What is so hard with picking up your own water and napkins anyway? I even prefer this way to waiting (or hunting down sometimes) for a waiter for a simple refill of water. 


-----------------------------------

All in all, strongly recommend this place for quick and delicious Vietnamese food, especially for the ones who don't want to deal with the plethora of unprofessional servers around this area.

{"text":"The place and servers are definitely not the best. They are rude, don't really talk to you and the place is dark and not comfortable. 

Buuuuuut, they have good pho (Vietnamese soup) and cheap and good fresh spring rolls. Each one would cost an average of $1.50 and comes with a delicious agridoce sauce.

If you need a fast lunch, need to grab a snack to go or want a healthy choice but want something cheap, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"Service is fast, prices are reasonable, food and drinks are yummy. If you're in the area and in the mood for Vietnamese this is the place to pop in."}
{"text":"Pretty good veg options, decent prices, feels like food my mom would have made."}
{"text":"Features: good food, pay before it's served to you

I didn't think I'd like Ginger - well, not as much as I did, anyway.  

First off, I thought it would be expensive, but you can get a full and happy tummy for less than seven bucks.  And you can self-serve yourself all the lemon water you desire.

It's worth noting that if you want something a little stronger, you can grab a beer at Ginger as well.  The alcohol prices are lower than a number of bars in the area, too.  I'm not sure if they'll keep serving you indefinitely - but that might be something that would intrigue someone out there.

The Pad Thai.  That's what I had.  It was great.  Far better than some of the super expensive Thai chains that have been spreading across the city like an oily plague.  Not unlike the one that almost saw the end of Fox Mulder.

What I really like about Ginger is that it's one of those crosses between sit down, and fast food.  You order, you take your number, and you pay.  Then when your meal is up, they'll bring it to your table.  Any restaurant like this, is right up there in my book.  All the charm of being served, but without the 15% tip charge.  I mean, you can tip in the jar if you want, but...

Also - when you're done, you just get up and go.  No waiting for the bill, awkwardly.

Seventeen ocelots out of a possible six grape fruit trees.  Would eat again."}
{"text":"Unless you're ordering the top 3 most requested items on the menu please stay away."}
{"text":"$6 pho? Open really late? This place has my name all over it.

The large pho is a dollar more, and comes with a little more noodles and a lot more broth. I'm someone who likes to drink most of the broth (gotta get my daily 1000000% dose of sodium!) so that's fine by me. The broth was very very salty. I got the rare beef pho, and it was pretty good - there was a good amount of meat in it. It wasn't very well cut, and it definitely wasn't quality cow. Could have used a little more noodles.

Still, sooo cheap and soo convenient. The staff is very nice - I like this location so much better than the other ones close by.

Stay away from the pad thai though."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken curry pad thai. Big mistake.

They should rename their pad thai to 'noodles with ketchup' because that's what it tasted like. Noodles seriously tasted like they had straight-up ketchup for sauce. Ended up drowning it in the brown hoisin sauce from the counter to make it even edible. 

Sooo cheap but I was a little annoyed I paid anything at all for the pad thai.

I've had their pho and their rice dishes and they are all pretty good, especially for the price. Stay away from the pad thai but definitely try their other options!"}
{"text":"Ordered #22 large: Pho with rare beef and beef balls

Pros: large portion, good price for the size, great location

Cons: Tasteless broth, tasteless rare beef, stale vegetables. But worst of all: NOODLES - I love me some al dente noodles that don't get soggy, but these were next level hard to digest, they absorbed none of the soup flavour and the texture was nigh artificial."}
{"text":"Good Food - I prefer takeout.... the restaurant isn't overly clean... But the food you get for the dirt cheap price is amazing! I love the sweet and sour seafood soup and the avocado and tofu fresh roll."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Ginger before; it's a Vietnamese-based chain. I'd forgotten how much food you get for your money. It's freshly prepared when you order it. You order at the counter and then sit and wait; the seating area at this particular outlet is unprepossessing, like a somewhat better Chinese takeout with tables and chairs. Service is good, even when they're busy."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of Church and Wellesly, this Ginger gets a lot of business throughout the week. It's a popular place for take-out* or a quick sit-down meal. You won't find yourself waiting long; like most Asian restaurants, Ginger ensures that speed, as well as good food, is also a priority. 

The staff here are awesome and very efficient, always hardworking and willing to do whatever you need to perfect your dining experience. Like the other locations, condiments (i.e. lime, hot sauce, salt) and water is available at a self-serve counter near the cashier.

As a vegetarian, I can't say much for the pho. However, I agree with Kat F. that you can never go wrong with the curried eggplant on rice . The sauce is absolutely delish and I must applaud the fact that the eggplant - not mushy or overcooked - is always grilled perfectly. I wish I could figure out how they make it! The portions are just good enough that you won't slip into a post-lunch food coma, but dammit, Ginger! WHY WON'T YOU GIVE ME MORE OF THAT HEAVENLY CURRY SAUCE?! In the end, I often find myself eating white rice on its own, or just chucking the remnants out. The curry:rice ratio here isn't exactly the best.

The fresh rolls are decent, but as other Vietnamese people have told me, nothing compares after you've had the real deal in Saigon. I agree that I haven't had many amazing fresh rolls in Toronto.

A 5-minute walk from the subway and a decent meal for $10 if you're on the run.

3.5/5 stars

*Served in Styrofoam. No biodegradable containers here. When I worked upstairs, there were a few occasions where they let me take the dish upstairs and bring it back down. Not sure how likely they'd be willing to do the same for others."}
{"text":"This location falls way short compared to its Church St. counterpart.

The two dishes I've tried here are pho and pad thai. The pho is very average. Broth, noodles, and meat are all so-so. The broth was not hot enough. The pad thai was bad. The chicken was dry and bland and the noodles were so-so. The price is cheap and matches the quality of the food. Nothing too much more to say. The hoisin sauce was also watered down. 

You go to the counter to order, they give you a number, and they bring the food to your table. The food came way faster than it should. My pho was on the table within 1 minute of me placing my order which made me question how they prepared the food. 

Even so, this place is usually packed at lunchtime. I would say this is largely due to its location, cheap price, and its 'in and out' style dining which may be attractive to people who work in the area. Again, the food is VERY average (if not below average)."}
{"text":"A lot bigger than the other Ginger's 
Good food at a reasonable price
Nothing spectacular but consistently good with enough choices"}
{"text":"I was here last weekend and I really liked the rare beef pho. The broth was clear and the flavours were really balanced. The beef was tender but not too soft. The service was also great. I'm not quite sure about the other items, but I highly recommend their rare beef pho."}
{"text":"I have had better pho. I would have scored it much higher, but the washrooms are extremely disgusting. If they can't keep the washrooms clean, they won't keep the kitchen clean."}
{"text":"Good eats good portions good prices.   Large menu.  I eat here at least once per week.  Very busy.  Small.   Not many tables.   Cold inside at front tables during the winter."}
{"text":"So....my opinion of this place has grossly deteriorated since my last review here.

I love the Pho here. That is the problem. Yes, this place looks like a turd and it isn't clean or maintained well. It is and should be a flag here. I'll admit I i didn't get sick the last time I ordered from here. But my Pho did come with an Extremely long hair. As someone with short hair....I was disgusted and couldn't eat there anymore.

I would say it's worth it to head to the Ginger down at Church and College. Cleaner and less people."}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Delicious.

What else can you ask for? 

Well ok, I admit the atmosphere isn't that great. This location is facing Yonge street, it gets loud and too many people walk by honestly. It's definitely not a great spot for people who wants to hang out and chat. Seats ain't that comfortable and honestly I had the feeling their floor is always sticky for some reason. 

BUT, their pho is pretty good and I always get that when I eat in there. And honestly for the location, their food is very cheap. Great place to grab a quick meal. I really like their spring roll, very crispy and juicy! Just delicious  

I've also tried their egg noodle with lemongrass flavoured tofu. Surprisingly good! Just a portion is a little small. But it's something great to order as well! 

** if you like durian, you will love their durian smoothie! Just amazing. 

Tips: this location offers 10% off if you pay cash!"}
{"text":"Ginger. You take care of me when i'm hungry and lazy. You know what I want. Something quick and tasty that makes me think it's healthier than fast food, but really, when you look around the place looks kinda grimy. You are decently affordable and for the price, you're great. You only lose points, because really, I wouldn't introduce you to my parents. You're my booty call of restaurants.

This Ginger location has treated me better than the other one on Yonge."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've been to Ginger before and remembering it a lot better. That said I used to go when I was drunk. 

I went sober this time in the middle of the day and the pad Thai was dry, too sweet, and ... Ummm expired tasting. 

My friend equally hated his pho. 

Avoid"}
{"text":"This is another place Yelp led me to while in Toronto.  

I don't normally eat Asian food, but my boyfriend is a sucker for Pho so we decided to give this place a try.  What perfect timing too, it started raining in the middle of summer as we were walking to this restaurant!

We shared a bowl of Pho and had this Pad Thai dish that included chicken curry with it.  The pho was whatever but I've never had Pad Thai like that before.  I really enjoyed the combo of mixing the chicken curry with the Pad Thai.  That's something I wish they had around the Los Angeles area."}
{"text":"Decent place. Beef pho broth was flavourful though meat slightly on the bland side. Wanted warm soup on a cold day under $10 and it delivered!"}
{"text":"The service is consistently bad. But, the fact that it's $7.35 taxes in makes it worth it as most Pho places are about $10. They don't have a huge selection of Pho, but, decent. 
It's kind of table service, kind of not. When you walk into the restaurant, you order your food at the counter, they give you a number and then they bring the food to you.
Four stars for price and quality. They lost a star because the people who work at the cash register taking orders is always miserable and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Heavenly food! Hands down one of my favorite places to eat. The Pho, the beef, curry chicken, everything is awesome."}
{"text":"The restaurant gods have not been kind to me lately...

Went here the other night with some friends and encountered a few mishaps along the course of the night...
First they forget about my friends order and it comes out a full 15/20 minutes after the first dish. Then when it finally arrives a random and very large piece of chicken has made its way into my friends veg dish. (big no no). The server is very accommodating and offers to bring another dish. Fine. 
My dish, the green veg curry was missing the tofu. The server was going to take it back and bring me a new dish but I was starving so she just brought me some tofu. Fine.
Seems like the kitchen was sleeping that night however the server was polite and apologetic about it. Most importantly though the food was just meh..for the price. The soups are very reasonably priced but my dish was $9. That is a standard price for a veg thai dish in most mid range places. I expected better.

From reading the other reviews it seems like your best bet is to stick to the soups. I might give them another chance with a soup."}

VIBE 
The Bloor St. location is quite bright and clean. I love it! Very modern. They also have seating for solo diners near the window. 

WE ATE 
Chicken Banhi Mi (or baguette) for $3.50. Honestly, this is one of my cheap eats secrets. Such great value. You could have this for lunch or dinner and feel satisfied. Chicken spring rolls are $2 and salad rolls are the same. It's all really delish! Great for a quick snack if you're not craving noodles or a big sandwich. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
You don't have to have ginger with your meal but honestly, for the value RUN don't walk kids! Plus, I like that the locations they have are pretty convenient to major intersections downtown."}
{"text":"Ginger you're giving gingers the world over a bad name!

There's some appearance of cleanliness at this place, everything else goes downhill from there. The food was pretty meh, my pork chop was pretty bland and the plate  they had served it on was so chipped that it was embarrassing. 

I didn't go in expecting butler service but Ginger, you can definitely do better than chipped plates, rude staff and very mediocre food."}
{"text":"Church Street's go-to place for quick, decently healthy food. Recently remodelled, lots of space, and the best (only?) Vietnamese coffee in the gaybourhood."}
{"text":"My review is not on their pho. It is on their pork chop plate (porkchop + veggies + rice) and their no.19 i think that comes with chicken beef and shrimp and an eggroll. Pork chop without tax is under $8 and no.19 is under $10. I think for the amount of food, they offer great value.

I really liked their porkchop. Straight off the greasy grill, with cilantro on top, the porkchop was pretty moist and was both sweet and savory. With a bit of  hot sauce on rice and veggies, I was very satisfied with the meal. They give you about 1.5 slices. Once again, it is less than $8. This gets four stars. 

After liking the porkchop, I went back a few weeks later to try another grill dish. I wanted to try all the different meats so I got the plate with chicken beef and shrimp. They were a bit dry. Not as flavored as the pork chop. But the chicken egg roll that came with it was pretty good actually. I will get that again. Overall the portion was good. This gets three stars.

Considering how much value they offer and yelp doesn't allow me to do half star, I want to give then 4 stars for what it is. Its a cafeteria joint that just serves out quick food. Its pretty good and its cheap. Don't expect great service because they got no time for that. Clean environment, great service they all come at a cost some restaurants cannot afford with their price offering."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Totally authentic Vietnamese food in a fast paced environment. My only watch out for women is to keep your eye on your purse. My purse was stolen at lunch today, and luckily I had two amazing ladies who helped me out. They tracked my iPhone to a park around the corner on Charles. Luckily, the thief only took my cash. I am a Canadian living in North Carolina (and on a flight to Charlotte on Sunday after taking care of my Dad in Charlottetown PEI, and visiting my daughter in Yorkville this weekend). Where does one begin to find all those important items such as a wallet, passport, Nexus card, green card, credit cards, and NC driver's license. The ladies and their iPhone saved the day. The restaurant promotes paying cash for a 10% discount which is a haven for thieves. Please be careful. Their cameras only cover 80% of the restaurant - don't sit at the front end of Yonge by yourself."}
{"text":"Ginger is everything I ask for: delicious, quick and filling.

As soon as I order, my food is ready. They bring your order to the table fresh and hot. I had the raw beef and beef ball noodle soup. My oh my was it filling. Normally, when I have pho, it lacks noodles, but in this case the noodles were plentiful. And they gave me more meat than I expected (no homo).

The prices weren't bad. I have no issue with this place except for the fact that it is in Toronto and I live in NYC.

I'm definitely coming back to this place when I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, decent portions, however prices are definitely on the higher side compared to other vient food joints such as my current favorite, Pho Ha Noi. I did like how we can order at the front and then take a seat, and the speed of service was definitely a plus! Wouldn't mind coming back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"The counter service, casually cheesy decor, and cafeteria-like dining area isn't the most appealing, so my favourite thing to do is to call ahead for take away. Regardless of whether you have the foresight to call ahead or not though, the staff are always very efficient and the food takes no time at all to come out.

Ginger doesn't have the best pad thai (in fact, it lacks any vegetable substance and should just be called \"sweet and sour noodles\") and don't even have any stir-fried glass noodles on the menu (which is my all time favourite thai dish), but the variety of salad rolls they offer alone is enough to keep me coming back on a regular basis. 

Jicama, yam tempura and avocado, and shrimp are in my opinion the best, but it's always fun to mix and match. On days when you're feeling like a lighter meal, a few fresh salad rolls paired with a hot and spicy soup can be most satisfying for the taste buds."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and so end up popping in here quite a lot. The fresh spring rolls and the pho are great! I'm not a fan of their \"pad thai\" and the other vermicelli dishes I've tried were not my favourite. It is a busy place and definitely  a \"fast food\" feel. I suggest take out."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. For years I have gone to Ginger for the same thing: Delicious food served almost so fast it's confusing. Ginger provides a wide variety of vietnamese meals averaging around 7 dollars each. I've never had anything there that didn't pack a lot of flavour, Ginger's staple spices being Curry, Lemongrass, Coriander and, well, Ginger. With these spices they offer a wide variety of combinations of marinated and grilled to perfection Chicken, beef, shrimp, rice, noodles, vegetables, pad thai, soup and vietnamese sandwich combinations all displayed with life sized and very accurate pictures on a giant board above the cash.  

What you order and fall in love with today will taste the same every time you go there. Water, lemons, several different kinds of hot sauce and sweet sauces are available as well as any utensil you would care to use. Portions are generous, I have never left hungry.

 The decor is unintrusive. It is usually full of people but in ten years I have never had to wait for a seat, I'm never cramped or uncomfortable in any way. It's not fancy but it's comfortable. 

Ginger is perhaps a good place for a lunch date but not so much for a formal date as it is kind of a fast food( except with amazing food) kind of place.  

(the other Gingers are not as good as this one)"}
{"text":"I was waiting for my take out order, and a cockroach crawled by my feet. I gasped, told the cashier, and he ignored me. I would advise not to eat here, as it was busy, and a cockroach was out and about - there must be more."}
{"text":"I tried the vermicelli noodles with chicken and found it much too oily despite the abundance of vegetables. It was also out within 2 minutes of ordering and that made me conclude uh-oh, not freshly cooked for sure. It was cold, and lacked flavor-- had to drizzle some Sriracha to make it a bit more interesting. I also tried a shrimp salad roll-- there was hardly any shrimp in it, mostly just wrapper and noodles, and the only good thing about it was the peanut sauce. The place is presentable enough for a quick lunch, but more like a canteen or fast-food joint. Maybe I should've tried their pho but really, I've had better Vietnamese food elsewhere. I will probably never return."}
{"text":"I love Ginger! Huge portions and so delicious! Their shrimp over rice is really good :)"}
{"text":"Ahhh Ginger...seems like eons ago that I popped my Banh mi cherry here and had my first taste of what could arguably be called Viet food and have subsequently fallen in love with Ginger's cheap, fast furious and seemingly endless array of Southeast Asian style delights.

Here's a list of menu items I've sampled over the years at Ginger;


#8-11 Paradigm Bahn Mi with a choice of chicken, beef or veggie - for $3.50 how could you not love this?

#S6 which is the Tofu &  Veggies and lots of 'em, snow peas, broccoli and baby corn on a bed of rice $6.99

#20 Well done beef noodle soup -  it has a nice zing of lemongrass and cinnamon and it's fantastic for cold and flu season  $4.99-$5.99

#S1 Deep Fried Fish and Mango on rice with salad - a nice tangy Asian version of fish and chips also the fish is lightly crisp and not too greasy $6.99

#52 Grilled chicken on steamed rice - My \"Holy Grail\" Ginger meal of marinated chicken breast  with rice and sauteed cabbage $5.75

#27 Vermicelli with Spring Roll & Grilled Chicken - ordered this by accident as I was mistakingly given this meal instead of my usual #52 but I was pleasantly surprised plus the spring roll was delicious albeit greasy!

All of the meals mentioned are in generous proportions and could easily become two smaller meals.

No fancy digs here, as it's more like a cafeteria with bad tropical scenery trompe l'oeil wallpaper like your parents had in the basement in '75.  In fact I only do take-out from Ginger as it's rather ugly, I mean who wants to look out on Yonge street at the endless parade of \"#winning\" I find it does little to inspire my appetite atmospherically speaking.

Customers range from Ryerson students to Asian grandmas to hungry Brass Rail patrons and you may even catch a glimpse of the odd peeler itself taking a break from the rigors of working the poles (both animate and in-animate!)  You can't miss them as they'll be dressed in the standard off duty uniform of Juicy sweats, Mukluks and scary nails and cheap hair extensions, yet another incentive to eat takeout unless maybe...you're Charlie Sheen?"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on a trip and was basking in the number of Vietnamese restaurants. I'm not clear if all of the \"Ginger\" restaurants are owned by the same organization but I wish they were in New York, which sounds crazy.  \"Fast\" food in the sense of convenient but not based on pre-packaged ingredients.  Yummy rolls, very nice salmon dishes, pho, etc.  I'd go again in a minute the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Is food great? Yes. 

Is ambience great? WTF. 

This is not a place where you'd bring your first date. You'd be dumped before it even starts. Sticky tables. Semi self serve. Water jug. This place is semi Chinese, semi Vietnamese, semi Thai. I don't know what it is. 

But here's what I know: 

1. Average cost of food is $ 8. 
2. A baguette costs under $ 5. 
3. Grilled chicken, though swimming in oil, look healthy. 
4. When ordering anything with rice, you can request for a brown rice at no additional cost. 
5. Grilled chicken is Yummy. 
6. Curry pad thai, is so unhealthy. But yummy. 
7. If you tried other Ginger restaurants, do not assume that it would taste the same here. There's a bit of variation. Always ask if you have allergies. 
8. There's lemon beside jug of water. Lemon, people, is thought to make you lose weight. 

Ginger away!"}
{"text":"Fast and cheap meals under $10.  Great for those in a rush and on a budget.  Not for those who need wait service or a leisurely relaxing meal.

Love the lunch combo for $6.99 that includes grilled chicken on rice, spring roll and drink."}
{"text":"WOW, poor little Ginger has only 1 review? I'm surprised!

Ginger is a great little vietnamese \"fast food\" style place on the Bloor Annex strip.

As the previous reviewer mentioned, the portions are BIG and they don't skimp on the meat, which is unusual for your typical Annex asian food joint. The food has a nice \"fresh\" feel - nothing is served greasy or overly fatty.

The menu is big, consisting of mostly Vietnamese and some Thai dishes. 4-5 different varieties of spring rolls, 4-5 \"salad\" rolls (the fresh rice paper rolls), pho, bun dishes (vermicelli), various pad thai, udon and stir fries and a slew of vegetarian options. 

They also do some really awesome thai style salads - papaya salad with beef, and a mango salad with chicken & shrimp. Both are delicious.

Prices here are really cheap - $5.00-$7.50 for most entrees, salad/spring rolls are all $1.50-$2.00

They also serve really cheap beer here, domestic bottles are $2.95

Decor is modern but plain, place is clean. You order from the cashier and you get a number. Food comes out uber quickly (3-5 mins) so it's a great place if you're in a hurry. 

Overall, a really great place for cheap eats. I typically pop in here when the Sushi on Bloor line up is long and I'm too hungry to wait (it's only a couple doors over). In the summer they open up the front so you can sit, eat and people watch in a few seats that overlook the street."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is cheap and delicious. I've only come here for take out and usually get the beef vermicelli with spring rolls. Service is quick. Choice of place to go when it's late for sure."}
{"text":"I don't think my order is too hard. I like a large chicken noodle soup with less noodles and more sprouts. Apparently this order can't be fulfilled at this location as it was only correct 1/5 times I have attempted to order this. On my last order it was a shit ton of noodles and barely any sprouts. Obviously they don't care about their customers so I guess I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"OK, really not bad, not expensive, and really generous amounts in the plates/combo (including meat, and that is to be highlighted, yes).

but not so heavenly (a little bit too dry to my opinion).

(have to try pho soup the next time)"}
{"text":"Yes it is cheap everybody and fast but sorry to say it is dirty and the meat has bad quality.
The guy at rhe cash regiszer is awful
Only cares the money. Dont ask amything because will get a comment in an other language
The taste of the food is great if u like salt and greese. All meat cooked toogether on a very black grill
Recentl got a red sign from the health department
And had to close immediately as it was health hazard
Do yourself a favor and go next door."}
{"text":"Great prices for the area. Meat is very well marinated and the service is super fast. They are open until 11 pm and its quickly becoming my go to take out place!!:)"}
{"text":"This is my third visit this week. Ive been ordering on ritual and picking it up and every order came out perfectly so far.

 I've tried the pho which isn't as good to go but that's expected...and can you really complain about having pho brought home to you when your sick in bed? ;) 

The vermacelli with spring roll and grilled pork or beef are delicious, HUGE portions, very flavorful meat and comes with a nice salad (the mint leaves and marinated shredded carrots are so refreshing in contrast to the grilled meats) the spring roll is also a chicken spring roll rather than veggie ! 

The food is very good value for the quality and portions most meals are under $10.

I'm probably going to continue coming here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"We have lived around the corner from Ginger for a year and a half, and have never tried it because the interior doesn't look overly appealing. We finally decided to give it a try because of how busy it normally is. I'm really glad we gave it a go, because the food here is really tasty and cheap! 

We ate at Ginger for lunch. We ordered two vermicelli bowls - one with chicken and the other with beef. They both come with a spring roll. The meat in both of these dishes was high quality. The chicken was white meat, not thigh pieces and pretty tender. My husband said the beef was really good as well, with no chewy or grizzly bits (as has been our experience elsewhere). The spring roll was not what I was expecting. It's filled with pork and the spring roll wrapper isn't at traditional one. This wrapper was much thicker, and much more filling. It was different, but I still enjoyed it. Overall, the vermicelli bowl was pretty dang good for $8.50! What a steal. If you pay cash, you also get 10% off your meal. The food was out lightning quick, and there is a selection of hot sauces to choose from at the condiment station. This would definitely be a great place to pick up some fast takeout. 

I probably wouldn't eat in the restaurant again. It's dark and dingy, and feels sort of dirty. I don't think it is, it's just outdated and old. Will definitely be back for takeout though!"}
{"text":"When you think of Thai food, you think of fresh, colorful, refined, cheap food. 
I ordered a papaya salad, a mango salad and a fresh shrimp spring roll to test this place out. I ordered from the app Ritual which was amazing, my food was ready when i arrived, I ran home to eat it and when i opened the box was so disappointed.

The mango was a pale yellow color, harder than rock, and almost uneatable. It also had a few coarsely grated carrots, a huge mint leaf and some peanuts. The papaya salad was basically exactly the same thing dressed exactly the same way. The shrimp chips they had in there with the salads were stale. The only color in the shrimp roll were the two shrimps. Apart from that, white and pale green lettuce, a bunch of vermicelli noodles and two big mint leaves. 

Clearly no love was put into this food whatsoever.

This is NOT thai food. This is NORTH AMERICAN bullshit. I hate this country for their inability to produce good quality cheap food."}
{"text":"I remember last time I been to this place is back in the days I work at TD Waterhouse many years ago...I love their PHO and I encourage fellow Yelps to give this place a try."}
{"text":"The good: cheap, fasts, tastes very good
The bad: dirty, floor slick with grease, limited space to sit

You come here because you want a quick and tasty pan-asian meal to fill your stomach, without costing you too much money, especially when you're alone."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Had the pho with well done beef and it was delicious. Only thing to watch for is the water, you pour it yourself and it's slow so if you're thirsty just order a drink as the time that passes will feel like eons, mountains will crumble to dust before the first glass is filled lol. Bit smaller than heir other location but had lots of seating available and the staff was pleasant. Would deffo go again!"}
{"text":"Good affordable Vietnamese food in different areas of Toronto. Any item of their menu is good. Bad customer service but again, what do you expect from Asians."}
{"text":"Cheap pho and open late = perfect! However the restaurant is really small and I often end up having to order my food to go as there's no room to sit and eat."}
{"text":"This location of Ginger is decked out in rainbows, appropriate for its Church/Wellesley location. However, I'm just not a fan of the size of the pho here.

Ordered a small beef special pho for $6.50 and it was honestly the smallest bowl of pho I've ever had in my life. I'm not a big girl, so my tummy gets filled up relatively fast - but I was still hungry after my lunch!

The pho itself was fine - comparable to the Yonge/Bloor locations, but the size was just meh. Will make the walk to Yonge/Bloor next time instead."}
{"text":"If I have a longish lunch and I feel like treating myself to my favourite comfort food ever (pho), I'll come here and grab a small pho with an avocado smoothie. It's decent here, but definitely not the best. There's always a lunchtime lineup, which goes by pretty quick. They give you a number to hold onto in no particular order, and when it's ready, they call it out. The biggest delay is when someone isn't paying attention and they totally miss their number being called.

The chicken vermicelli here is good too, and also a nice lunch alternative. All in all, decent viet food, but not to stay and dine."}
{"text":"You order at the counter first then sit. They will bring it to you sort of deal. Food is reasonable and price is cheap. Fills you up. Would recommend if ur looking for cheap eats."}
{"text":"I had their small bowl of super noodle soup (it has all rare cooked meat in it and oxtail), a shrimp salad (summer) roll, and a bubble tea. Everything was pretty much terrible. I would give it no stars, but the extra star is for the nice customer service. The noodle soup was way too salty and lacked in flavor. It could've used more mint or basil leaves. Usually the broth would make or break the dish. This time it broke it! Towards the bottom of my bowl my noodles were kind of congealed all together and I had to use my chopstick to break them up. The summer roll had a bit of old iceberg lettuce and bean sprouts rolled up into it. I could've dealt with that if the peanut sauce that came with it wasn't so bad. The sauce tasted like day old hoisin sauce with sprinkles of peanuts on top. I mean, the sauce was kind of sour...like rotten sour, and it was masked with more salt! I'm going to have to take a diuretic pill just to cleanse my body of all the salt I just ate. And I love salt! I cover my fries in it, I love my Chinese food with MSG! So when a salt lover tells you, it's salty, then damn! It's going to be salty. Lastly, the bubble tea was watered down and the bubbles were too mushy. I think a lot of the stuff they're serving has been sitting out, which, when you think about it, is so gross. 

Vietnamese noodle dishes aren't hard to make. It's literally hot water, beef broth, choice of meat, rice noodles, and basil and mint. I wish this place could just get it right. The worse part is, it's Vietnamese owned. You would think they would know better. 

I should've went back to Made in China :)"}
{"text":"I wonder how much better this place could really get. I mean, fast service, cheap food, and delicious...am I missing something? Oh yeah, that's right, dining room could use some work, but who cares when I'm downing a delicious bowl of pho!  I was visiting Toronto with my girlfriends - everything was so expensive. 12% tax? And I thought Chicago was bad.  But we stumbled upon this place - and safe to say I will be back...a 5 dollar bowl of soup? I'm in. And delicious? So in. I will definitely be back next time."}
{"text":"When u need pho urgently, this location will do.  I prefer the location on church street though, the staff are much friendlier and there is way more selection of food."}
{"text":"It's OK here. We always get the grilled pork or chicken with rice. But I think they lather on the MSG because it tastes so unusually good and we're always so thirsty after. Service is pretty fast and there's plenty of seating, even a pseudo-outdoor patio. Pro-tip: Watch out for your bags, this place is known for thefts even with the video cameras. Pro-tip 2: Don't get pho here, go to Pho Hung on Spadina and Dundas instead. Pro-tip 3: Get the spring rolls; they are excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty standard as Vietnamese goes.  I find this location to be a little grungy so I usually get my food to go and bring it home.  The food is good and has never let me down when I'm in need of a rice noodle and bbq pork fix."}
{"text":"This place is the MacDonald's of Asian cuisine ....and that's not a bad thing. It is what it is. This is the place for a quick in and out or take away. NOTE ...if you do stay in and eat, when you walk out your clothes will stink. ...especially if it's busy and they are cooking a lot.

The food is good and the prices are great. Recommend for a quick lunch or late night snack."}
{"text":"CHEAP MEALS!

This place is super cheap and the portions are huge.  The grilled meats and chicken are great, and the $3 chicken sandwich is amazing.

Great food when in a rush and on a budget."}
{"text":"Got pho with well done beef to go. Meat and broth both lacked flavour. Meat was both too fatty and tough to eat. Would have liked more herbs included in the container of add-ins. Maybe their other food is better."}
{"text":"Ginger is the last place I will be expecting myself going for a quick Pho fix. But when it is -20C outside and you are at Yonge and Bloor and having something warm and slurping delicious just sound too tempting to ignore! So we decide to give Ginger a try with an open mind. 

Yes the noodle is not the fresh type. 
Yes the Pho broth might not be the most balanced one with star anise 
Yes that sweetening taste in the Pho broth might be a sign of MSG 
Yes the rare beef might not be the best cut 
Yes the self served area for utensils and chili might not be the most hygienic 

But me and my friend both has an enjoyable dinner, stuffing ourselves with Rare Beef Pho and Hot and Sour Noodle Soup... and we did not regret that we eat here! 

The service here was friendly and efficient!! In and Out with no fuss! 

Cheap, Fast, Fulfilling, Reliable and Simple. Ginger really does well in all these departments... Sometimes that's what I want in my meal... or even in my life?"}
{"text":"A good spot for a cheap lunch. One of my go-to spots downtown. Rare beef pho is tasty but could use a little more flavour. Lots of beef in the bowl but the meat is sometimes a little tough and can tend to be somewhat chewy. Vermicelli with chicken also has large portion of meat but chicken is a little rubbery.

The Banh Mi are better, probably the best thing on the menu along with veggie fried spring roll. Rice dishes are also good with large portions.

Food is cheap and always comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap, delicious food. The servings are huge and food is always prepared fast. The staff is always friendly and efficient. Ginger is one of the best restaurants at Yonge and bloor without a doubt!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and cleanliness of the restaurant area is bad even for a fast-food place, and the pho is gross. Their pho tastes funky and comes with meat that did not feel safe to eat. I cannot even tell what kind of meat it is. Price is not even super cheap either. There are definitely better places in the area to grab dinner."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style where pls n thx you not part of the service. They lose orderz and chaotic. Had beef vermicelli with a spring roll so greasy not edible. Seems too many items on menu and so all arent executed well."}
{"text":"Prices are high. Quality of food is not that good. The only positive I see this as is their portions are decent. Go there if you are a student and there is a 10% discount!"}
{"text":"Food used to be better value, but now it's gone up. The quality of the staff and the food is only so-so. But for it's price it's still decent. It's hard to find a better deal than this still if you are looking for pho. Good for a quick meal or snack if you are short on time. Better value than say eating at Mcdonalds if you compared fast foods."}
{"text":"I just came back from a poor take out service experience. I went after a long bike ride with my dog and friend and they waited patiently while I ran in for what is usually a quick and good experience.
Unfortunately, my luck has run out with this place. My food sat sitting on the counter for about a good fifteen mins or so before the cashier realized I had seen everybody before and after me be served (about two people ahead and three people after, plus a number of tables). The waitress who packed it put my food in a bag and just left it there. The waitresses and cashier walked by at least ten times looking every so often; one waitress looked in the bag, picked up the ticket next to it and threw the ticket to the side. The cashier finally asked me what I ordered and handed me what had been dying at the pass this while with a straight face and no mention of the wait. It's take out, I get it, but it was lukewarm at best when I got home and I ordered the beef ribs and saw that they had skimped and gave me half non rib normal beef to boot.  
What really got me was that I had commented that that order had been sitting out for so long when I was passed it and he just said yea sorry roughly and didn't even seem genuine about it. He should have been straight forward from the start and been the one to bring it up not me, that made me feel like he thought I was dumb enough that I didn't see what had happened. I was a regular here, now I will be a regular at the Yonge street location. My friend raves about that one as much as I did here until now."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Definitely beats trekking out to Chinatown during the cold winter months, for the same freshness and cost effectiveness.
 Definite try."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, I'm a huge fan of Ginger. Their location on Queen Street is my go-to if I'm in the area, and I've eaten at this location many times. What I've discovered, though, is that this location is probably the weakest of the bunch. The food quality tends to be far lower than it is at either the Queen Street or the Yonge/Dundas outposts.

I arrived around 5:30 on a Monday and the place was about half full. I decided to get my usual (vermicelli with spring roll & grilled beef) and was shocked when the total came out to over $10 with tax. Wasn't it just a year ago that this concoction was about $8?? What on earth!

Anyway, after an unusually long wait, my food was brought out to me and it certainly looked the part. A few bites in and I quickly realized that something was awry. The bold flavors I usually associate with this dish were almost completely absent, and the meat was riddled with bad, inedible pieces (I would estimate I threw away a quarter of the meat). 

I mean, don't get me wrong: this was definitely fine and I ate all of it happily. I've just come to expect more from Ginger."}
{"text":"Because I was hungover and Pho is my goto cure, I was satisfied though overall quality was sub par. It should be called Onion instead of Ginger because the broth was overkill on the onions. The beef portions were also tiny and quite disappointing. I may only return because it is easy on the wallet and quick. It did help me feel better though after a long night of drinking so I will bump up what should be a 2 Star review to 3."}
{"text":"Best lunch place near Yonge and Bloor. They do a ridiculously addictive Chicken Sub and the fruit bowls make you feel like you are actually doing something healthy!"}
{"text":"Great for snacks, wonton soup and Pad Thai! Full but you're refreshed with clean palette of ingredients they used. A go to on the cheap side compared to Salad King."}
{"text":"Of the five Gingers in existence (two on Yonge, one in the Annex and one on Queen West), the one at Church & Wellesley is clearly the best. Even though Ginger is a franchise, each location has its own menu and item availability varies from location to location. 

I love ordering a couple of yam tempura and avocado fresh rolls ($1 each!) and the curried eggplant and tofu entree. All of this and a drink is still under $10. Brilliant!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant based on a recommendation from a very good friend. I'd like to think she's a foodie.... And a smart one at that!

During the middle of exams and midst of a snow/rain storm in April; I had the experience of a life time. I got a large seafood pho for 8.13 taxes included (a 10% student discount was provided to me for showing my student card). 

I went around dinner time and the food came fast and fresh. My seafood consisted of shrimp, squid, mussels and crab meat; all very large proportions. The broth was excellent and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The portions were large, so big I had to ask for a take out container. 

I chose to dine in and the restaurant was small but quaint. A lady was walking around and picking up garbage as often as it was found.

Overall great food, amazing price and huge portions. I'd go again for sure."}
{"text":"Cheap, and better than most fast food. But rather flavorless for real fans of Vietnamese, and prone to Americanized-ingredient substitution. At the prices, I wouldn't say don't go there, but I'd happily pay a couple of dollars more at a half-dozen other places in the city."}
{"text":"Major stomach ache after eating a bowl of rare beef and beef ball noodle soup (pho). The soup was not hot enough, so my beef (even when I left it under all my noodles) was literally left raw in my bowl.
I was unable to finish my bowl and left most of the beef untouched, so I basically had noodle soup!
This place was packed when I visited for lunch on a weekday, the interior was really dirty and sticky. 
Because of my incident, I may not visit this location again, but I will give another location a try. 
If you have a really sensitive stomach, I will not recommend this place, or anything that was basically raw."}
{"text":"I continuously look for good thai food and a good deal. I used to live nearby, so naturally I've been here a couple of times. 

I am a big fan of their daily specials and cold salad roles. Great for take out or to stay in and have a beer with your meal. 

Great soups, noodle dishes like spicy pad thai and COLD SALAD ROLES... Yeah, I'm a big fan of those.

Overall, fast, cheap and good quality. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Come lunch and dinner, this place is like Grand Central Station, every few seconds a new number gets screamed, another happy diner picks up his food. I come only for pho, it's always watered down, but the flavour is ok, piping hot, fresh basil, onions and filling noodles take care of my craving. The meat disappoints, but you get what you pay for and you get it in under 5 min."}
{"text":"I like how cheap the food is at Ginger and i usually get the Chicken bun.  There is one near my work but i find that the one on Queen street is a lot bigger space and in portion size.   Not sure why it seems slightly better tgan Yonge street location."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick to-go lunch over the weekend. The meat on the pork bahn mi (sandwich) was a little on the greasy side, but for under $5, it was delicious!!

Credit cards only accepted over $5!!"}
{"text":"I picked up some of my favourites from this place the first time. (pad thai, curry chicken)
The noodles were dry and stick together in one big block, the curry was average)
I wanted to give it another chance, I ordered online and after 10 minutes I called them to add something.
After I picked it up in a hurry I realized they forgot to give me the soup I had paid for, and I was overcharged by $7. I called them and I was told that the online prices are cheaper, and because I changed my order on the phone the charged me extra!!!!
What a monkey business!!! Never again!"}
{"text":"Used to be our go to place, but they've messed up our orders a few times and I've been noticing the quality of food going down - fried fish being way over-fried and greasy, pad thai noodles and fried rice that probably sit there all day. Perhaps it's time to find a new place."}
{"text":"Been traveling for the last week and this is exactly what we needed... home cook food, it was delicious and the waiter was very nice."}
