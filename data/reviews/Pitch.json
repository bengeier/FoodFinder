{"text":"I am only giving this two stars because the food was marginal. Service was probably the worst I've ever received. Our server was not attentive, drinks came out wrong, several food orders came out wrong, we didn't even receive some of the food we ordered. It was a Wednesday night and not busy by any means. Probably won't be back here."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked up to Pitch from our nearby neighborhood for lunch today and we both thought it was excellent. We sat inside, which was tastefully decorated and the music in the background wasn't too loud. They have a great dog-friendly outdoor patio (with heaters) and a corn hole game nearby. One reviewer complained that it wasn't good for date night because the tables were all large tables, not smaller more intimate seating arrangements. On the patio they do have couches and small tables that would serve, and inside there are several smaller tables.  As to the food, the grill-roasted artichoke appetizer with hummus and tomatoes was surprisingly flavorful and the serving size certainly was enough for 2. I had the beet salad, which was large and boasted a broad variety of greens, thinly sliced beets and goat cheese. The topper of a phillo dough \"roll\" filled with goat cheese would have made me happy all by itself. (Hey, chef -- how about an entire plate of those as an appetizer???)  My friend had a burger with sauteed mushrooms and cheddar and said it was delicious and very filling. The side salad had a similar variety of greens but also included garbanzo beans, which was a nice touch. She asked for her burger cooked medium and it came back cooked exactly that.   Our server (Cooper) was personable and knew her way around the menu. (I never remember my server's name after I leave a restaurant, sadly. But Cooper -- I'll remember.) Pitch is not inexpensive, but the food sure seemed worth it to me. We didn't try pizza or sandwiches this time, but we'll be back to experiment more. As a footnote, I told Cooper that I was going alcohol free for Lent but wanted something non-alcoholic but more interesting than soda. I got a cranberry juice and seltzer. Other places I've been have charged $4.50 just for seltzer water. Pitch rang up my drink as a coke and charged me $2. Much appreciated! Good luck, Pitch. So glad to have you in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really hoped this place would become a neighborhood favorite .. alas, not so.  Tried hamburger and the meat patty was so thin it literally fell apart .. we love happy hours and go at least twice a week .. why would we go to Pitch when the alcohol/wine prices and appetizers cost so much more compared to our favorites like Roaring Fork and Seasons 52 ... actually, the overall prices are too high ... plus, they just received 5, yes 5, violations on restaurant review.  Tsk, tsk ..."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Everything about this place is awesome... actually BEYOND awesome.  I had the wedge salad with shrimp and it was fabulous.  My friends had a delicious mushroom burger and Turkey melt.  The presentation was great,  the customer service was unlike any I've experienced in a very long time.  Before leaving,  I asked who I thought was the manager,  who owned the restaurant and he said, \"me, and a couple others\".. as he proceeded to clear our dishes.  An owner actually out and about talking to customers and clearing dishes??? what the whaaat?  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the vibe of this place and their dog friendly patio! They don't have vegan options on the menu so we ordered a vegetarian pizza with no cheese, but it came out with a cream sauce. Our server was great and corrected it right away! Thanks lady!"}
{"text":"I went to Pitch on Thanksgiving Eve for drinks and dinner. Nice indoor and outdoor seating. Cool vibe and music. According to our waitress, it is a \"farm to table\" restaurant without microwaves and heating lamps, meaning we wouldn't get our food at the save time.  Took an extra long time to just order our drinks and food. Took another 5-10 minutes to get our two drinks. Our food came out staggered as promised by the pasta items were ready before a simple chop salad. Seems like it should be the other way around. Food was hot and tasty. I had the mac and cheese plus shrimp. Very filling. On food and atmosphere, 5 stars, but service left a lot to be desired.  Looks like it has full coffee bar and weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Love it! Super friendly staff, awesome food, fabulous wine selection! One of my favorite \"go to\" spots in town! The Thai pizza is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Super set up. Great indoor and outdoor seating. A full bar and we had an outstanding Pitch Cabernet. Dean the man in charge oversaw our perfect evening in this new restaurant. Our server Cooper made it all happen. Terrific artichoke appetizer and a beautiful beet salad got us started. The Salmon rocked and there was zero left over chocolate cake. We will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Pitch is located in a great location and has a nice open layout that looks inviting.  In practice it doesn't work out so well most times of the year in a place like Arizona...either far too hot or cold.  To start with there is entirely too much staff.  Falling over one another.    Each time we get the server spiel of the specials.  There are so many that I stop listening after the 3rd one.  No one wants to hear 6 specials....how is that 'special'?    The food is OK.  Nothing special, nothing awful.  The only food quality complaint was a soggy pizza which seemed to be from toppings that probably weren't dried after rinsing prior to being placed on the pizza.  The showstopper problem for us is that the food is delivered at random.  We were told it would be delivered when ready, but it's a bit ridiculous when 4 of us ordered a pasta dish and 2 pizzas which were delivered one at a time and only after the previous was consumed.  It took nearly an hour to get all of our food.    It was this way each time we've tried Pitch.  There either isn't an expediter or anyone in charge of the kitchen.  Each time the waitress disappeared after the order was taken.  And each time the manager came to applogize that they were training new people.  2 of 3 times we we're given coupons for breakfast or lunch.  I was out of town and left my easy going septugenarian parents with the coupons.  When I returned, my mother asked what I was thinking sending her there.  She described the omlete as something that tasted like it was cooked the night before, frozen and thawed out by running it through a dishwasher.  It was so off putting she called upon returning home to let the manager know of the quality of what is being delivered to the customers.  The manager told her she didn't know what she was talking about and hung up on her.  My family had been in the restaurant and catering business for a combined 110+ years serving high end clientielle.  We know our craft and rarely complain.    We just vote with our pocketbooks.    Pitch has a chance to turn it around, there is a good core. However, I think this place will be mismanaged out of business.  There is a ton of competition in South Scottsdale and near by Phoenix.  Nearly all are better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Awesome place with good places to sit inside of outside depending on the time of day. First time here tried a pizza and was not disappointed quality ingredients loaded on top. Can't wait to go back and try some other intriguing menu items."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  The pizza is amazing and the appetizers are too. I love that they have an area outside to play while you wait.  The kids liked playing while we waited, but it wasn't for long despite how busy the restaurant was. The beet gnocchi appetizer is to die for. The Pims Cup is refreshing. The wild mushrooms on the pizza are breathtaking. The entrance is a little difficult to find but more than worth it to walk around a bit. Try it and fall in love with this excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich is AMAZING!  The ham and bacon combo with the basil pesto aioli!!!  Try it!  You will love it!!!!  Pam"}
{"text":"Great food but even better happy hour! The food was delicious and there are so many happy hour drinks and food specials! Everything came out right away and the servers were kind and friendly! The weather was beautiful and the large patio was well lit even after nightfall. The other customers set a great atmosphere that wasn't too loud but still lively. The decor is trendy and updated. There was a large variety of vegetarian options and the pricing after happy hour wasn't too pricy. I thought a place like this would be more expensive so I was pleasantly surprised! Will surely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and I'm looking forward to another try to see if the service will be more consistent, and to try other items on the intriguing menu. The servers other than the PHENOMAL Cooper, the up and coming Brianna and Miguel really need a lot of training. This includes the hostess and even one of the managers.   The good: decor and atmosphere. Probably the best patio atmosphere I've come across. The menu variety is great. I tried an appetizer combo of roasted Brussels sprouts and creamy cauliflower. The veggies were not great, but the sauces were fantastic. Others in my party loved the crab cakes, the cheeseburger and the onion rings.   The bad: The service, aside from the three superstars mentioned above. A craft cocktail tasted like there was either no or barely any alcohol. I took a few sips and asked the waitress if I could exchange it for a glass of wine. She said she would talk to the manager and brought me the wine. When the bill came, both drinks were on there! When I asked about this, she said the manager said I would have to pay for the drink I didn't like. I asked to speak to the manager, and his response was that it would still cost the restaurant so they had to charge me. He insisted I drank way more than I did. My friend who sat next to me verified I took a few sips and he relented. That's a manager who is pretty short sighted over what would probably cost them about $2.   About half of our party had Cooper and their food came out much faster than everyone else's. She had great answers to first timer's questions. Just a night and day experience from the other half of us. Soup, which is obviously ready to serve took a good 20 minutes to come out, and just 2 minutes before entrees.  Some of us stayed after dinner and split a bottle of wine and had great service from Brianna and Miguel. They are new servers but they understand how to give customers a great experience.  I hope to revise my rating to 5 stars after another visit because the potential for this place is great. If they are willing to listen to feedback they should be very successful."}
{"text":"Behold one of the best gluten free pizzas in the land! Their crust is beautifully textured, and their toppings can't be beaten. They readily accommodate the gluten intolerant and do so with a friendly attitude."}
{"text":"Experience started out weird. I walked in looking to have lunch, and the hostess just stared at me until I asked where I could sit. Not the best first impression.   After that, sad to say it didn't get better. The pizza is subpar. I ordered a Margherita pizza, which should have lots of flavor, but the only thing I could taste was the basil. Bland, flavorless sauce, and the crust was overly dense to the point where it almost felt stale. My brother asked the bartender what the restaurant's specialty was, and he just said, \"All of it, everything on the menu is the best.\" No. Wrong. Is that really how the staff has been trained to answer a question like that? First, it offers no guidance whatsoever on what to order. Second, a specialty cannot be \"everything.\" If that's the real answer, it's a bad one, considering the pizza was so underwhelming. If nothing is more special than that, I have no reason or desire to go back. There are other places in the area doing similar food much better."}
{"text":"If you're confused as I was, yes this place is surrounded by a bunch of businesses. I went for weekend brunch with one of my bros. FYI, parking on the left side if you don't know how to enter.  The menu was very extensive. Even so, we still opted for some of the daily specials, like a smoked salmon omelette and a peppadew steak pizza.   I opted for the chicken fried steak and eggs. Classic dish doesn't seem too adventurous, but they made a gravy with white wine that was actually on point. The steak was well battered and thin, just as I like it. However, I will say it wasn't a perfect experience. The succotash had good beans and ham, but it felt like the potatoes were on the side of barely done. Two or three minutes on the flat-top or fryer would have made the dish a home run for me.   The pizza was largely successful, and I think worth being their focus. The thin crust somehow held up against more than a generous portion of toppings, with being neither burnt nor oily. It was a little heavy on peppadews for me, but that might be personal preference. It does get my approval though, and I'll definitely be back to try some of the dinner staples.  Out of curiosity, we tried the creme brulee. Beyond the crisp sugary layer you see specks of black for the fresh vanilla, which you don't see often at restaurants. Some might say it's runny, but I actually loved the softer base - made it eat more like a pudding then a flan.   I think Pitch has a lot of potential, with solid brews and food. I hope it continues to do well so I can come back!"}
{"text":"Great opening night with Dean and his team at Pitch last night.  Excellent Tuscan white bean appetizer and meatball pizza, not to mention a strong selection of California and Italian reds.  Service with a smile and a great vibe made for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"We love coming here after our bike ride around the canals. Our server Cooper is top notch and makes us feel right at home. I am obsessed with their wings and gorgonzola sauce (I came back after 3 days because I was craving their wings.) Their pastas are rich in flavor and can be enough for two people. Their pizzas are also great and I like their Red Sangria. Give this place a try! They also have a good brunch menu."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is now a Pitch in Scottsdale!! Love their wine selection and the pizza is always on point (and the mac&cheese and burger- yum) Not to mention the staff and service is solid! Their specials are always unique and tasty and the ambiance is relaxing and classy! They have two locations in Omaha and when I lived there, it was our go-to spot...I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's cute and new - the vibe is casual and hip. Plenty of parking without the annoyance of valet. Staff is attentive. Menu is big on pistachio but has something for everyone - open concept with plenty of seating. Ordered the Brussel sprouts which we loved!  The gnocchi was amazing! Served in cast iron to keep warm ... the dishes are all very large prepare for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Showed up for brunch this morning with a group of 8 and got seated right away. Staff is very attentive. Bloody Mary's are amazing! Had the corn beef hash which was out of this world. The rest of my group had everything from pizza to salad and breakfast burritos and were happy with every selection.  Highly recommend giving Pitch a try. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"New place in town we gave it a try, & will positively be back. We ordered pizza, & wings with a salad. Everyone at the table was highly impressed with the food & service. We went in the evening and loved the ambiance. Pizza is made in a wood fire oven. Go in give them a try :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. We eaten there three different times and the food and service is always amazing! I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have had many amazing dishes. If you like artichokes I recommend the appetizer but be prepared it is not served like you will expect-it's more a salad but the chokes are amazing and the dish is fantastic! The parpadelle is amazing so is mushroom pizza! The only reason they dont get 5 stars is because we have been many times now since they opened and they still cannot figure out how to time their meals to hit the table at once. We've been 10+ and it has happened 100% of the time. Be prepared for your meals to come it separately. Otherwise Pitch is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Good place to go chill, drink and eat! There is a great outdoor space, and there is outdoor bar space as well, which I love. Been there a couple of times now and the service has been good both times. We were in a group last time and took a long time to make decisions etc, and never felt rushed. Decent beer selection and some interesting cocktails along with some good classics. Haven't tried any of their wines.  The menu is varied but everything has been good. The mix and match starters are the best part! The cauliflower and brussels sprouts are a must try. The pizzas are tasty with some interesting combos. In summary, definitely a fun place to hang with some friends!"}
{"text":"Went in to just checkout our new bikeable neighborhood place for HH. Great service, great atmosphere, tasty hot well prepared apps, nice beer selection, what's not to love. Will be back soon for a full meal"}
{"text":"Awesome place, Great Food and Music, new team, still working out some of the kinks, but give them a try you will love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Mia pizza (gluten free or regular crust, sausage, and pepperoni) is even better than the La Grande Orange Gladiator, or the True Food Chicken Sausage pizza. The place is gorgeous modern, with easy parking and bike racks right in front, a huge dog friendly patio graced with mature trees and a view of the Papago Buttes. The couple next to us were enjoying the Short Ribs Grilled Cheese sandwich and a delicious looking salad. More promising menu options, including gluten free, and the friendly staff and owner topped off the experience. A new favorite South Scottsdale haunt."}
{"text":"Stopped for a drink, cool set up and layout had the crab cake app very good. Pizza looked little over priced. I will return"}
{"text":"First visit to Pitch and we are impressed. Great service tasty food and s good value. Chopped salad was good but needed a little more onion or something. The Zamia pizza was fantastic. Decent price for restaurant wine $40. Cappuccinos with amaretto Post aperitif We will be back for the happy hour."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new place. The food is amazing. Outstanding craft cocktails and wine list. Matt and Brian are fantastic operators and keep the atmosphere fun with great music. If you haven't been to Pitch yet, get here. Patio rocks as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came last Friday for the soft opening with two friends. Love the layout, decor and patio! Service was on point and food amazing. We had their wings with Mac and Chz to start. We did a few pizzas to share for dinner. The pizza was large enough for two but if you want to take some home order for each person. My favorite was the Tres Peps. My buddy and I got the grand booker, if your a whiskey drinker I highly recommend it! We will most certainly be back. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great location in the newly opened Quad office park. Good selection of beers and great vibes. The calamari was good, and loved the pepperoncinis on top. I'm excited to have a spot to go to after work for happy hour. My one negative, is they are anti ranch dressing, to the point that you wonder if the owner had a bad experience with ranch in the past. The Joe Rogan - Joey Diaz video perfectly explains it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXwakHd0UU0. As a ranch guy, I won't give 5 starts until we get some ranch up in there. This is operation ranch dressing."}
{"text":"WOW, WOW, WOW is all that I can say! We are SO excited to have this fabulous new restaurant within biking distance from our house. There are so many great things about this place, I don't even know where to begin so i'm going to make bullet points to make sure that I don't miss a thing!  *Dog-friendly patio *Happy Hour from 3-7p *Gorgeous open-air ambiance *Super friendly service *DELICIOUS cocktails - I had a cucumber + jalapeno mule and it was so fresh and tasty! Not too sweet either.  *They use locally sourced, organic ingredients *Great beer selection *FOOD IS AMAZING!   We ordered their grilled artichoke appetizer to start and you guys, I will be dreaming about this for days. There were 4 BIG artichoke heart halves + stems, grilled to perfection served over a crunchy flatbread with homemade hummus, over mixed greens with tomatoes and an onion vinaigrette. It was all topped with LOADS of parmesan cheese! Like BEYOND dreamy.  For the pizza, we split The Doc which was packed with so many goodies! It had mozzarella, tomatoes, fennel sausage, pancetta, goat cheese, asparagus, and basil, to name a few.   We will be back SO SOON. Like maybe this weekend!! :) Welcome to the neighborhood, Pitch!"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT.  Artichoke with long stems that had been marinated.  Meatballs the best. Pizza was excellent.  The facility is excellent.  Acoustics gentle. Lighting superb.  Great patio. Plenty of space between tables.   Loved it. Congrats Dean! Larry"}
{"text":"Great place! It's only three blocks away from us and we have been there three times since Thanksgiving. We have had the tortellini twice, artichokes, meatballs, a few different pizzas, etc.  all have been fantastic. I am used to artichokes being more of a peel and eat - but these were all laid out so we used fork and knife which was fine. I am all about the cocktails and the bartender was very accommodating. I requested a grapefruit martini in Lieu of a lemon drop and she concocted something delicious. The two bartenders from our previous two visits were outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Really nice indoor-outdoor atmosphere. I think this new restaurant will do well, especially considering that most tables there were ordering multiple drinks before noon on a Saturday.  Servers were pleasant. Lots of them standing around, waiting for more business.  My husband's cheeseburger had excellent flavor with a fresh bun. His shoestring fries were good and plentiful. I would not re-order the corned beef hash. Too many large-chunk potatoes and not enough other flavors. The meat in it was ok.  They could use some fly control. Big open garage doors allowed many flies in.  Will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Our server, Lucas was great and extremely knowledgeable about the menu items. The atmosphere is inviting with seating in door as well as out door and it is conveniently located in the heart of a neighborhood, I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The bartender is hot.... I hope she calls me. Also apparently I am supposed to write more because it was not enough to post..."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for a drink and some dinner.  What a great new place in an unexpected location.  Lively atmosphere, airy indoor/outdoor space, friendly staff and tasty food.  I enjoyed a Stella cidre and we shared an order of fries and a meatball pizza.  Definitely a great addition to that neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the area, fantastic menu, great patio, and good music! They ha e a fabulous happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Gourmet pizza and great crab cakes that are better than most. The whiskey, bourbon, and wine selections are extensive and reasonable. Will eat my way through the menu and know I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing place. Slightly tucked into a business plaza, but with an amazing ambiance. Beautiful interior and exterior. All the staff was friendly and informative. Our server, Miguel, was extremely friendly with a wonderful smile and had a great knowledge of the specials they were offering. The food was by far the best part though. I got a Pork Belly Sandwich and my friend got the Basil Pesto Chicken Pie. My Pork Belly Sandwich was perfectly cooked and seasoned with two eggs on top and a delicious pickled cabbage underneath. My friends Pizza tasted amazing (I stole a bite or two). The crust was probably the best I've ever had. If you are looking for great food and an extremely friendly ambiance, this is definitely the place for you. I would give it 10 stars if I could. It's hard to find good food with a friendly atmosphere. Thank you Pitch for the great food and the wonderful staff you've hired. Will definitely be back for more yummy food!!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend chose this restaurant to have her birthday lunch. What a nice surprise! Pleasant decor, a lovely server and delicious lunch! It could not have been a better choice! They treated us very well and the menu has a lot of different choices! I was torn between the beet salad and the short rib grilled cheese! The grilled cheese was amazing! I had the side salad which had garbanzo beans and a sweet Italian dressing. My daughter had the truffle fries and we could not stop eating them! So tasty! We will return and sit outside in their great patio next time!"}
{"text":"This spot just opened up in the Quad on 64th and Thomas. So it's right beside my office. Great device and the outdoor patio space was perfect for our large group. So excited to have this option so close by!"}
{"text":"Came here with my dad a month or two after it first opened. Great history behind the restaurant with a very open feel. The service was great and the food was pretty good. Ordered a few appetizers and a couple pizza's. I'd recommend the pizza and to sit on the patio. I'd highly recommend for a off site work happy hour or going out in groups."}
{"text":"Despite the lack of music on the patio, I found this place to be a fresh take on coal-fired cuisine which is not easy to come by in AZ."}
{"text":"One of the \"operators\" named Brian verbally abused a kitchen employee in front of us on Sunday morning (11/12/17). We have no information on whether or not the employee was doing anything wrong. He simply seemed to be leaving with a pizza box. But, the point here is that Brian found it perfectly acceptable to berate another human, in public, in a VERY menacing way. Brian then proceeded to stalk that employee as he left, following him through the restaurant to the parking lot. We found it unnerving and scary that an owner of a restaurant thought nothing of taking his anger out in full view of his patrons. We observed him for the rest of our meal hulking around the restaurant speaking with little regard to other employees. We can't imagine that he'll keep people employed there for very long. I asked to speak to Dean, the owner, who was not available. Instead, the server whom I asked to send me Dean sent me Brian whom I declined to speak with and said I would call Dean. My unwillingness to disclose the reason for wanting to speak to Dean visibly angered Brian and he would not stop asking me what my problem was, and I continued to respond that I would call Dean. He walked away stating that I was \"unbelievable.\" As for the food, they apparently have a policy that it is served when hot. So, my partner's meal came five minutes before mine. We asked them many questions about the menu and the answer to most everything was no. The food was simply mediocre and not worth the trouble. Too bad because Scottsdale needs good restaurants, not just a collection of bars. A poor start for this new enterprise and I can say with certainty that we will not return."}
{"text":"The Pitch offers a fresh new menu to Phoenix. The meatball appetizer and artichoke appetizer are yummy. The patio is cozy and offers views of Papago mountain. Happy hour is a great deal so be sure to show before 6pm. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great food, amazing atmosphere and the staff is more then accommodating!! Dean the owner went above & beyond!!! A must try! Thank you for moving to our hood!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. Food was mediocre at best. Atmosphere was cool but the food wasn't. I don't expect this place to stay open long with the cure t menu."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. The patio, atmosphere, and location off the canal earned 3 starts. We rode our bikes here on Friday night with a group of friends. The service was ok, slower, but expected being a new restaurant. Our server was young and messed up a few of the drinks but got the food orders correct and that came out quickly.   But man, the food and the prices wouldn't ever make me want to go back. I was blown away by the prices- $16 for a chicken Caesar salad that was Small and plain. And pizzas are 12\" thin crust for $21! We got the doc as that was what she recommended and hated it. The ingredients didn't work and it had an odd spice. The calamari was big but not much seafood, rather a lot of battered zucchini and way too much breading. Overall we were disappointed. And for a few drinks and some food each couple spent around $75-$100. For beer, wine, and pizza. Not impressed. For this location they better get the prices down or I don't see this place making it."}
{"text":"Great Marsala Pizza and Tagliatelle. Calamari had too much breading. We sat outside and the ambiance was lovely."}
{"text":"Nice hangout with good food, food beers and a nice atmosphere.  Pizza was delicious and the service is attentive and welcoming.  Highly recommend for a happy hour or a night out on the town."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. The first time I was impressed: great atmosphere, food was good, and service was great. I got the artichoke appetizer (very good) & the calamari (nothing special about it). Others got the spaghetti (very good), The Doc pizza (very good), & the crab cakes (also very good). The only bad thing is that the food is served as it comes up because they don't have heat lamps so people were eating way before others. The second time I ended up getting the crab cakes and they came out a little burnt (not as good as I remembered them the first time). My third experience I ended up getting the Scampi. The scampi was more of an alfredo that is very very bland. I ended up adding a lot of salt, pepper, red pepper, & lemon to give it some taste. Cute atmosphere, would recommend for drinks."}
{"text":"Everyone's raving about this place and I don't understand why. The food was decent but over priced and service was average. Overall it's over hyped over rated and over priced."}
{"text":"Definitely add this to your list of restaurants to visit in the Valley! We enjoyed a couple appetizers, a pizza, and pasta...and all of it was so tasty. Four of us shared the truffle fries with 3 different aioli sauces for dipping, roasted brussel sprouts (I prefer mine a little less crunchy, but the flavors were yummy), scampi rigatoni, and finished with the mia pizza + 3 eggs on top. We even had a bit of leftover pizza and pasta to send home with my mom for our stepdad. The ambiance was great. Our server was sweet and a great salesperson. The food was a hit! I also like that there were quite a few people in the restaurant, but it didn't feel crowded or noisy. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere was great, why is a pizza that barely feeds 2 $19?  Maybe I'm not refined enough? My opinion LGO Wins on food, price and atmosphere is a tie.  Someone please explain why $19 pizza!!!!!!' Seriously. I don't get it. Pitch Management please message me, love your location and concept."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good and the building is cool with a huge front patio. The Parmesan White Beans were a tasty appetizer and prices are very reasonable. Service was prompt and accommodating."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, once when they first opened and then a couple of months after. They really worked out the issues from my first visit, I would've given them two stars because I felt the food was unimpressive and inedible but the service was good.   Tried it again because of the awesome dog friendly patio. I was pleasantly surprised this go around. The service again was awesome, very friendly staff and attentive. On this visit I tried the calamari appetizer, along with the Margherita pizza. I'm pretty elitist about Margherita pizza. I must say their Margherita pizza is the second best I've tried in the area (second to LGO). I will definitely be returning now because of the awesome patio and the food, I'm glad they worked the issues out from when they first opened."}
{"text":"Very much in the vein of hipster kitsch type dining environment that is so prevalent today: Industrial interior features; open, communal-style dining atmosphere; coal-fired oven. That said, we'll see how long this concept plays out. Until then, I'm good with the nice choices (and large portions) that places like this offer and Pitch was no different. The Pitch \"VIP\" Smoked Cheddar Mac & Cheese (with fennel sausage) was outstanding and enough for two meals!"}
{"text":"We went here a few months ago for happy hour. The restaurant has a great dog-friendly patio and is within walking distance of our house so we figured this would be a great staple in our happy hour repertoire. The menu is also what I consider leaning towards the \"foodie\" sphere, so we were extra excited. The place crashed and burned hard. They don't have many beers on tap, and only 1 IPA on their entire menu. They cater to cocktails and wine. We started with the calamari; it was bad. I had a few pieces and stopped eating. My date found a piece of plastic bag literally fried into the breading of the calamari, suggesting their calamari comes in a frozen bag. When we mentioned this the manager(?) that came by, he didn't seem phased. We also ordered the arugula salad and the Mia pizza. The salad was good, although the more expensive ingredients (e.g., pear, gorgonzola) were sparse. The pizza was a disaster. I can honestly say it is the worse pizza I have ever had from a restaurant. It tasted like something that you'd buy in the Walmart freezer section AND it was almost $20. It is one thing to be a shitty hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but what pissed me off is that they pretend to be a \"foodie\" location. I walked out of there wishing I had ordered from Dominos, that is how bad it was. On the walk home we left the leftover pizza on the corner near the trash in case a homeless person came by. If you want good pizza go to La Grande Orange in Arcadia."}
{"text":"We picked this place based on the reviews and it did not disappoint. Service was good. Not over the top friendliest but friendly enough and efficient. I never would have ordered the artichoke starter if I hadn't of read the reviews... but wow. Just do it. Incredibly impressed with it. We got and shared a pizza and the meatball salad and not a single thing disappointed. The house (cheapest) red wine was also fantastic with our lunch."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new restaurant as it is in walking distance from my home, and has a nice outdoor patio.  My first experience was just ok.  Our server was very inexperienced and very under-trained,  breakfast was ok.  coffee was good but they charged me 50 cents for milk they had put in the coffee!!!  that was a shock....however, .being so convenient,I decided to give it another try for lunch, and this time I brought  my family. on a whole the food is fresh and good. The problem occurs with the staff, the waitress and mostly the management.    My brother ordered a breakfast sandwich and asked if the meats (ham and bacon) could be substituted for avocado. and the croissant be substituted for wheat bread.  .   .  He  specifically said \" if that couldn't be done he would choose something else\".  the waitress said \"no problem\"   the orders arrived and  the sandwich was made on a Croissant. :(  He decided to just eat it.  Also,  the little side salad had no dressing on it at all.   he politely asked for some dressing.   When the bill arrived they CHARGED for the avocado as an add on, not substitution for the meats... and they also charged for the salad dressing!!!! , which they had forgotten to put on the salad to begin with... well, I'm a believer that people are reasonable. when we asked about these charges the waitress said, she was sorry but didnt have authority do anything about it. we requested to talk to  the manager, who then came over. and instead of apologizing and taking care of the errors  he was  ARGUMENATIVE, RUDE, SARCASTIC and SURLY.  He presented with the  WORST customer service I have experienced in my 38 years of living in Arizona.  There are many good venues, & great food choices in the phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I will definitely not be returning to Pitch and I'd encourage anyone in the Arcadia/Scottsdale area to spend your money at a place with friendly ,nice staff and management that want to build community and relationships. These people running Pitch don't have a clue of how to become part of a neighborhood, build a local brand, or even how to create a successful business in a closely knit , highly competitive market like ours. Take your inexperienced, brusque, curt and gruff staff back to Omaha......youre not the kind of business we want in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"The good: Tasty cocktails, beautiful outdoor atmosphere. The pizza is ok. Crust is tasty, and there's a good ratio of ingredients. The sausage is DELICIOUS.   The bad: Everything is pricier than I think is merited. $21 pizza is kind of insane in this area. The place is across from a Fry's parking lot. I mean, it's pizza. $3 a topping? Come on. I also didn't like their misleading menu. The happy hour menu says \"$5 off any pizza.\" We ordered a create-your-own pizza and didn't get the discount. I asked why and was told that the create-your-own isn't included in the Happy Hour deal. I'm not going to fight about $5, but that was misleading and disappointing and illogical. When I suggested they change the wording of \"any pizza\" they responded \"we're not changing our menu, we've never gotten any complaints.\" I thought the attitude was dismissive and kind of embarrassing. I'm a customer giving you a (rational) suggestion. Even if you're not going to change it, at least acknowledge that you can see where it might be confusing, and approach it with a less smarmy attitude. They did give us a $10 gift card, which I appreciate, but I will not be back, even though I live across the street."}
{"text":"Loved this place from the moment I walked in. Super open concept. Huge cute patio with ping pong and corn hole. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The owner suggested a wine and it was as delicious as he described it. Service was fast and on point. But let's talk about the food... yummmmm we ordered gnocchi, calamari, and some kinda peppers from the app menu and each one was finger licking good. The guys got pizzas that looked and smelled amazing. I shared meat ball app (huge) with another girl who is Italian and thought they were just as good as hers:) well maybe not as good all and all we enjoyed our night and definitely will be back. This is a new restaurant in town from Nebraska go check them out and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm excited that a restaurant has decided to occupy the Quad off of Thomas.  It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  There are several issues, however, that need to be ironed out if it expects to have any staying power.  Among them:  - Pretty awkward layout.  You will circle the building before you realize that you have to walk through the patio to get to a table.   - Pretty dismissive and unhelpful staff.  The process for ordering takeout, for example, is a haphazard affair.  Hopefully this gets ironed out over time. - Pizza was beyond average.  The crust was dense and hard and the pancetta was the saltiest I've ever experienced.  There are too many better options in the area.  We'll be back to try a few more things on the menu and give the place another shot.  Hopefully my experience was the exception.  It would be nice to have a regular neighborhood spot but there are far too many options in the area to tolerate average."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal! The design of the place is super modern and hip. The server was very sweet. The service was horribly slow. It took 30 minutes and two times ordering to get a cocktail. Once I got the cocktail it was fantastic. The wait between ordering a drink and getting checked on was incredibly long.  When the manager found out that the service experience was subpar he literally did not care at all.  Personally as a local business owner my approach would be different. I don't need or want to be comped but empathy would be appreciated. I also found it unprofessional that the bartender was drinking while working. I think he was on break. He was eating and having wine. I'm only posting this because the concept is awesome and the owners are not local. I hope it works. I hope they read this so they know what's going on. Regardless of this experience I will give it another shot."}
{"text":"Took my husband out for his birthday and I chose Pitch. Glad I did.  Anna was our server and she was amazing. She was super nice, kind, patient, and even brought me iced tea to go at the end of our meal.  We had the VIP MAC & cheese, a yummy pizza (pear & goat cheese), Moscow mule, and berry cobbler for dessert.  It was all very good. I did feel it was a little overpriced, which is why I chose 4 stars instead of 5. However overall this experience was fantastic. Definitely a place you can host a party too - their patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"Came to the soft opening this past Friday. Loved the atmosphere, the food was delicious ordered the VIP Mac and cheese, truffle fries and margherita  pizza. All were delicious had to take it home and ate it the next day and still tasted great! Also came back for the grand opening and had lunch. I ordered the mixed green salad and it was delicious and of course the margherita pizza! Will be coming here like a regular! Welcome to AZ!"}
{"text":"Went here with some girlfriends because, well, we needed a pizza night! I made a reservation, was seated immediately in a nice booth red area, perfect for catching up with the gals. We took a while to make up our mind to order everything, but our waitress was attentive and answered our multiple questions since it was our first time in. Loved the vibe and layout of the place. Seems great for large groups, small groups, couples, families, etc.   We ordered pizzas and a couple of sides. One of the pizzas had gotten burnt so it took a few extra minutes for all of the food to be in the table. They were very apologetic though and made sure the pizza was done right and came quickly behind everything else.   Would love to go back again! Curious what their brunch is like... mmmmm"}
{"text":"Superb place, love the food, the music and the staff. A welcome addition to Arcadia. You have to try the artichoke starter, and the s'croom pizza. We have a great evening and enjoyed Pitch."}
{"text":"First time visiting we were recommended the meatballs as a starter and The Mia pizza, both were delicious. They created a great atmosphere at this location. I feel like we had the best table in the place, the first table outside on the patio with the doors open and a gentle AC breeze coming from inside. Good drink selection. Some good Nebraska hospitality including frying up a couple eggs for our pizza even after we had eaten a couple slices."}
{"text":"Great for groups, not great for date night.   We were excited to check out this new restaurant in our hood, got a babysitter and did a date night here. I'll start with the positives and work down from there...  ATMOSPHERE: the view is great. Classy and contemporary decor. Mostly patio, which was chilly despite heaters (and asking for them to be turned on) on a January evening. Tables are mostly huge tables therefore not very intimate. We sat at a hightop that was cold and hard and could've fit 12.    FOOD: was good, but not like $22 a pizza good. We got the $19 tres peps and it was basically a pepperoni pizza with a cold jar of pepperonichinis and jalapeños on top. Like, the toppings were not baked in. Oh also served on a plastic plate. In my opinion Phoenix is a pizza Mecca, and you can just find better pizza elsewhere for cheaper. I wouldn't say it was bad, just unimpressive, especially given the price or that it's in an obscure location.     SERVICE: now, this place is new so I'll give em grace for still working out the kinks. Our waiter was awkward and clearly upselling everything and talked to us for far too long about cars (we aren't car people). They have daily specials which took way too long to explain. This would've gone over better on a paper menu. The manager came to check on us once and got way too close for comfort and touched me while I was eating which wAs weird (I know I'm not a dog but who likes that??).   Overall, I'm not dying to return given its expensive, quirky service, and uncomfortable seating. If my boss insisted on going her I would play along, at least the food isn't terrible."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Great Food: Good Employees: Great Service: A bit slow but sufficient Prices: High  I'm unsure whether this is common, but they don't provide wait times. I found this annoying because I was unsure whether our group of six would be waiting for 10 minutes or 60.   I recommend Pitch provide wait times to customers, even if they're grossly overestimated. Better to under-promise and under-deliver, right?  The prices will probably keep us away, but I still recommend it."}
{"text":"I like that we have a new spot within a short bike ride for us. I assumed it was another sports bar with a name like Pitch. But they have a full service menu and wine list. It's cozy hipster dark inside. Modern rustic....the garage doors at the bar are always nice so you feel like you're outside even when you're not. Speaking of....they have a great looking patio. Dog friendly. We ordered a Shroom pizza. It was plenty large enough for two people. It came super loaded with flavorful, earthy mushrooms. The crust was thin and crispy. It was super tasty.  There are numerous menu items....from apps and pizza to burgers and seafood entrees. A handful of vegetarian options are scattered throughout. But our server said some meat heavy options could be modified. Our server was really attentive and informative, considering this to be our first visit. I'm not a great writer so I'll close by saying we really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to check out Pitch restaurant. This is a really nice setup with an indoor/outdoor option for seating. I definitely like the fact it's a dog friendly environment. It also caters to bike riders who want to enjoy this great AZ weather. It saddens me that I had to give this place only three stars. The Margarita pizza I had here was mediocre. The fruit cobbler which looked great was also just average. Nothing about the food here would make me want to go out of my way to come back! This would be more of a place I would just grab a beer from to be honest."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're expecting to eat lunch in a reasonable amount of time - our casual lunch took over 1.5 hours. We had a party of five people, and over 30 minutes elapsed between the delivery of the first entree and the delivery of the last entree - the restaurant wasn't visibly busy when we arrived at 11:15 AM. Regardless of the quality of their food, I was so disappointed by the service at Pitch that I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and setting; menu had some intriguing options. However, the biscuits and gravy were highly disappointing; gravy was very runny; dish was luke warm. Friend's salad was soggy from too much dressing; lacked flavor and disappointing as well. Bartender was all over the place. Took our order, came back and asked if she took our order, 40 minutes later I asked someone else working at the bar if our food was on  the way, 10 minutes later they show up with 2 of our dishes but our pizza was still missing. Told the bartender to forget about the pizza, minutes later the manager shows up with the pizza and we tell him as well that we don't want it anymore because we are ready to leave at this point. He proceeds to say \"it's only been 16 minutes\" (so now they're arguing with customers?) Sigh.....at least they tried to make things right by taking off a round of drinks and gave us a few gift cards. I would give this place another chance if the food was good but when both service and food are terrible, I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a new pizza, burger, salad place that just opened up in a renovated office park.  The redevelopment of this property along a less than memorable stretch of Thomas Rd is very well done and creative.  Pitch has a big front patio, indoor/outdoor bar and large indoor seating.  It has that modern industrial design that's popular these days.  I sat at the bar and had a pizza and iced tea.  The Mia pizza comes with mozzarella, fennel sausage and pepperoni.  The flavors of the ingredients were very good.  I thought the pizza seemed a little greasy when it came out and the leftovers that I had the next day really kinda solidified into a clump when I reheated it up in the oven.  I'd probably try something other than the pizza the next time.  I'm also not a huge fan of their logo glassware.  It's a relatively small size and when I needed a refill on my iced tea the bartender had to go all the way to the back of the restaurant and into the kitchen, I suppose, to bring me a refill.  That's not ideal for him or for the customer.  Overall, it's a nice enough place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I first came here thinking it was a bar. Nope, Food is great with big portions and the drinks are like most places that serve cocktails. Try the onion rings with honey. The staff was very friendly and nice. And great atmosphere with the music that is upbeat."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Friday night as this new spot is right down the street from our house. There's something missing from the overall vibe of this place.. I can't quite put my finger on it but here's some pros and cons-  Pros- Service- you can tell they are trying reallllly hard to impress customers and deliver a good experience  Patio/ bar area- great place to sit and have a bottle of wine and app, can see this place getting busy during the spring for patio season.  Cons- Way over priced- I have a hard time paying 20 bucks for a pizza that's just \"ok\" when I can drive over to LGO and get one cheaper that's way better. Food- nothing on the menu we ate was stellar or even worth going back for. Very bland and just overall not good."}
{"text":"Nice patio but super turned off by the service. I made a comment about the potatoes in my dish being under cooked and my waitress gave me a weird look, said \"ok\"  and walked away. A simple acknowledgment or apology would had sufficed. Things like this make me not want to return to restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried out this place a couple weeks ago and we really enjoyed it. They have a huge patio which is great when the weather is perfect, or after dinner to have a casual cocktail on the couches. Our server was very attentive and made some great recommendations. I ordered the MIA pizza and it was very delicious. Cocktails and wine were also good. The only slight drawback is that this place is pretty \"trendy\" and loud, so not very romantic. Tables are pretty close together also. Not a huge deal, just thought it was worth mentioning."}
{"text":"We went there Sat night for the first time, and really liked it. Both my husband and I loved the pizza, and my husband is very picky about pizza. He also ordered the pork chop. The ambiance was great, loved the patio. The service was slow. Took 5-10 min for our server to greet us. Took another 10 min to get our first drink, which 20 min seems excessive to wait for a drink from seating. Had to flag down our waitress to take our food order 15 min later. Just assuming they're still working out their service kinks. But we would totally go again...and soon."}
{"text":"Cooper is by far the best server around! She is wonderful even each time we come in, she remembers are name and gives us 5 star treatment. Also the food is amazing! Everything we have ordered here had been nothing but pure perfection. The wine is fabulous. The owners are so friendly and make sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant within walking distance, and I'm ever so thankful! We've been 2x in the past week and were not disappointed! If you happen to dine on the nights they offer the Cheesburger Soup, go for it! It is phenomenal!!  I love the crab cakes, both appetizer and entree. My husband had spaghetti and meatballs and portion was huge, so prepare yourself. If you like salmon, there's is great. You can get it on any of their salads or as an entree. We will be back for Sunday brunch - cheeseburger soup and 1/2 price wine bottles."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Great drinks and great food. We enjoyed the awesome indoor/outdoor environment and service"}
{"text":"I have driven by Pitch many times and finally had the chance to stop by with my husband for Happy Hour. We really enjoyed the ambiance the outside patio is perfect in the winter and spring to relax and have really good food.  The Happy Hour menu is great it gives you a variety of food options as well as drinks. We had the Calabrese Meatballs and as well as the Short Rib Sliders with Sangria. Let me say we enjoyed all it. The service was excellent, we will be coming back especially before the heat kicks in.:)"}
{"text":"I had heard of Pitch when I lived in Nebraska but hadn't tried it so when this one opened up so close to where I lived I thought I'd bring another former Nebraskan there for her birthday.  Service was great the waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful.  The patio area is so cute!! And the food and drinks were great!!  We went during the day for lunch but I'm sure it's even cozier at night!! Definitely a fun place to try!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and boy, did Thomas need something like this. First time we went in, the owner was there and was excited to get us set up and recommend his favorite. The whole staff here is excellent.   We've been back several times now to eat there or get take out. It's always busy, but the restaurant is really well run. The staff seems to enjoy their time there. They have a great atmosphere with an indoor/outdoor bar and a few local beer selections.   Of all things we've gotten, the pappardelle pasta stands out as the best to me, but the other pastas and the pizzas we have had are all really good with one exception; the spaghetti. I wouldn't recommend the spaghetti as it's likely not what you're expecting. But, maybe it's just me as I don't like angel hair pasta.  It may seem a bit pricy at first glance, but the quality of food is their. Their pasta and sausages are made in house. Pitch is one of our new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Brian Bailer Owner/Manager is totally defensive to constructive information from a customer. His motto...\"the customer is always wrong.\"  Thank God their chef is good. Food is secondary to being treated like a gentleman or a lady. Calling a customer a LIAR when they simply explained that the entrees were delivered 10 minutes apart is simply rude.   Prediction - Brian's partner will buy him out before Brian runs the restaurant into the ground."}
{"text":"Yum!  I came here Sunday for a girl's lunch.  The patio is amazing!  Easy parking.  It was a bit too windy to sit outside but highly recommend.  We dined inside at a hightop and they had the garage doors open.  Perfect day! Service was fantastic and food spot on!  Perfect spot for happy hour or to hang out with friends.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The vibe is here is breezy, especially when the weather is nice and there's a... breeze.   Unfortunately, something annoyingly dumb happened, and it will just nag at me to the point I probably won't go back.  The happy hour says ANY pizza is $5 off, but of course, this apparently doesn't apply to 'create-your-own' pizzas which they didn't mention when I ordered one. To add a level of nonsensical absurdity to the bait-and-switch, the custom pizza costs $12 with \"San Marzano tomato sauce & mozzarella\" before adding your ingredients. But $6 of \"extra mozzarella\" and \"fresh mozzarella\" was added for no reason, and when I brought it up, the waitress acted like this was totally normal. Like every pizza obviously needs extra and fresh cheese. Because the mozzarella it comes with would never be enough. So apparently everyone who orders a 'create-your-own' pizza gets a mystery charge for mystery cheese. Sure.  So I spent almost $40 on one little pizza and a drink. During happy hour. No thank you."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Pitch!  Our server was delightful and very helpful in assisting us in menu selections.  We did the mix & match of pistachio brussels sprouts and creamy cauliflower.  Both were yummy!  I ordered a Margherita Pizza and I love that they served it sitting on a large empty can of Italian tomatoes!  What a cool idea, that I'm going to use at home.  It was tasty with a nice thin crust.  Other entrees our table tried were the Shrimp Rigatoni and the most amazing Lobster pasta with Pancetta.  All of the dishes were delicious.    Will definitely go back to try some other items!"}
{"text":"My fav new go to brunch spot!! Just down the street fun decor and friendly staff!! Located in The Quad on thomas a new installment and is a great eatery by day for breakfast, lunch and wine bar or dinner at night! I recommend coming here and relaxing on the patio where it is pet friendly and enjoy a good Bloody Mary or cocktail. Some brunch choices i Love is the short rib breakfast burrito and creme brûlée french toast. They also have seasonal tastes of the day one was the red velvet french toast which is to die for yummy!! Come check it out so it stays open!!!!!"}
{"text":"I brought a group of 10 to this venue on a Wednesday night and the service was incredible. Everyone enjoyed the food, wine, and cocktails. I had the fried brussel sprouts and a couple glasses of sangria, which were both very good! Only one person in my group got a pizza. The special that night was the taco pie and highly recommended by our server, but it was not was not my favorite. The pizza crust was really good indicating their regular pizzas are probably worth trying on a second visit.  The venue is beautiful with a large outdoor patio perfect for our Arizona evenings."}
{"text":"Pitch was so tasty! Amanda took care of us and did a great job. She was very personable and had so much knowledge about the food and the concept. The arugula salad was so awesome. It was a great choice for a birthday lunch. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past month with nothing but good things to say! Meatballs are incredibly tender, pizza is off the hook (probably the highlight), along with modern/hip restaurant and patio. The staff is friendly and management seems to always be active in the dining room. Could be the next neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"On my forth visit to Pitch....  We keep returning to Pitch simply because most of the food is very flavorful, the bar is spot on, and the floor staff is generally top notch.  But (there has to be a \"but\" to keep it from 5-stars) the kitchen is plagued by poor timing of the food orders.  The waitstaff repeat the mantra that they \"bring the food when it's the freshest and hottest to showcase the food.\"  In my experience, that is cover for an inexperienced head chef.  However, I cannot take any credit away from the creative dishes that are routinely delicious...even though it seems I am the last to get served and last to finish with any group I bring to Pitch.  Navigate the menu with some care.  As the name implies, Pitch is showcasing a coal-fired oven (any baseball references are conveniently coincidental).  To that end, they excel at the items utilizing the oven.  The duck is spectacular as is the pork chop.  The thin-crust pizzas are cravable in their own right, even in a town with no shortage of great artisan pizzerias.  The fired artichoke appetizer is very well executed (albeit, at times a bit over dressed so ask for the dressing on the side).  Pastas are a standard fare and likely won't be the item to dazzle you but certainly will leave you satisfied.  Go to Pitch for the incredibly fun atmosphere and coal fired fare.  As I said in a previous review of Pitch, I wish they would open up another restaurant closer to my home in North Scottsdale; perhaps \"Catch.\""}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and a few drinks.  Nice indoor and outdoor seating.  Couches outside with corn hole toss out on the grass.  They had a nice drink menu.  Their food menu had a nice range from  appetizers to dinner plates.  The food is your normal pub flavor.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Great place to meet up after work as well a great place for large groups."}
{"text":"I live very close to Pitch and when I saw that it was opening I knew I had to give it a try.The entrance is located by walking thru the outside seating area.We were greeted with smiles and given choices as to where we could sit. I have been there 4 times now with my first visit being my Birthday. My birthday celebration was with 8 family members on a Sunday (early evening) and we sat outside. We have 2 young kids who loved being able to get up from table and play corn hole located right next to outdoor seating. For my birthday we started off with drinks from their extensive drink list.We ordered San Tan Hefervizen Beer,couple of Pitch mules and a 1/2 price bottle of wine.All delish.For starters we had artichokes,beet salad, wedge salad and meatballs. All delish.We then had a couple of pizzas and burgers.Again delish.We shared and everybody loved everything.They gave me a fantastic tiramisu on the house with a candle for my birthday dessert.I have been back several times and have enjoyed their HH both inside and out.Had the hot wings,mashed cauliflower and roasted Brussels sprouts.We will keep trying new items but I must say the meatballs are the bomb !! I love this place and will continue to recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Incredible experience! We were craving pizza so did a Yelp search and the pictures posted and location are what brought us in.  Was very welcoming staff, nice decor, great beer, and amazing food! We felt like regulars after the way the staff interacted with us even though it was our first time there. We will most definitely return! Thanks Pitch!  Big props to Megan and the rest of the bar staff to provide a great experience!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and patio are great, but food was just okay.  Also very pricey for pizza.  Seems like the place is a little confused if they are a fancy place or a casual pizza/beer place with TVs.  Also, no ranch???  The heck?"}
{"text":"Finally a great new local restaurant near my house. It is located in an office complex that was recently remodeled. The food here is great and I loved the beer selection."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. So glad this place opened so close to me. It's def a must try place! Even came back in the morning to try breakfast. If you haven't been please do!   They're a little hidden.... in the Business complex that's been there forever that's been giving an amazing face lift  Just west of 64th street on the north side of Thomas   Your Welcome in advance"}
{"text":"My sister found out that the \"chop salad \" is not actually chopped, it's just called that (quoting a young manager). Then I found apple slices on my pizza of which none were uniform. The pizza crust was soggy at the middle corner by the third slice :( the fig flavor was good"}
{"text":"I love it when a new business opens near me in an area that has been revitalized.   This restaurant is sitting in the middle of an updated business complex.  I love the look of the restaurant - open, airy with lots of patio space, which is perfect for this time of year.  I'm a bit worried about them for summer because that's a west-facing patio and windows - that's gonna get hot!    First - our server was awesome.  We sat on the patio for lunch, and it was beautiful.  People were playing corn-hole on the green area.  The menu has a great selection with some really interesting options.  Two of us ended up ordering the short-rib grilled cheese and picked greens as our side.  The others ordered the shrimp po-boy and the long-stemmed artichoke salad.  I was really intrigued by the mac-and-cheese - it is filled with good for you veggies (spinach, mushrooms, etc.) and you can add chicken or shrimp.  Next time!   Wow - we all loved the food.  The grilled cheese had LOTS of short-rib. As a matter of fact, I would recommend asking for a little sauce on the side because it was just a tad dry.  But filling!  I liked the dressing for the salad - it had a bit of ginger and was yummy.    Those grilled long-stem artichokes looked fabulous (and my friend said they were) - I see these are also available as a starter, and I plan to try those soon.  The shrimp po-boy had buffalo sauce, and my friend said that it was a bit much - be sure to recommend SOS (sauce on the side).   I plan to meet other friends there this evening for Happy Hour - I can see this becoming a favorite rendezvous - at least until summer."}
{"text":"Love this upscale neighborhood pizza/wine bar.  They are always busy!  I have been several times and I always get great service and great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian love! We ordered the Margherita pizza and added avocado, pesto & peperoncinis...  wow! Amazing! Atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. Our waitress was very friendly. All the staff was also very welcoming. Definitely coming here often."}
{"text":"When we arrived we received a very friendly greeting and were given our choice of indoor or patio seat. Since with weather was delightful we chose the patio. Our server was very friendly as well. We order vanilla lattes and reviewed the menu.   This spot is biking distance so I was really excited to try it out. I was disappointed to see there was not pancake options however they had a breakfast burrito on the menu and they are my go to breakfast option. I ordered the short rib burrito and my husband got the breakfast special, biscuits and gray.  The food didn't take long to arrive. The presentation was lovely. My meal was delicious! Short rib burrito topped with scrambled eggs and a side of breakfast potatoes with chorizo sausage. It also had this tasty jalapeño cheese sauce.   My husbands meal didn't live up to the hype. His biscuit took up most of the dish, there wasn't enough gray or sausage. He was a little disappointed. However he got the other half of my meal so that made up for his order envy."}
{"text":"Great brunch!!!  Perfect portions with lots of flavor.  Service was outstanding.  Be sure to ask about the Wonder of the Weekend (WOW)."}
{"text":"My 1st Yelp review. This place is so delicious. The flavors are so unique and blend together so well. Try the Artichoke starter and the Bianco Verde Pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch today and was quite impressed. Our server Amanda was attentive and upbeat. Portions were large and food was very good. Will be stopping back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.   Service is good.  You just don't know it's a restaurant from the outside.   Many of us in the neighborhood thought it was an indoor batting cage.   Lol.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Always falls short. Food. Service. Just below the mark."}
{"text":"My mom & I decided to try Pitch for our first night in Scottsdale since my mom loved the Pitch in Omaha. We wanted to try a bunch of different things & ended up ordering two happy hour dishes & two starters; Angus beef sliders, Bolgonese Fries, Basil Gnocchi & Brussel Sprouts. The sliders were our least favorite of the dishes. We both agreed there wasn't enough meat or cheese plus the reduced balsamic drizzled on the top of the bun made our hands sticky & was hard to get off. The Brussel Sprouts were the 2nd to least favorite. The flavor was delicious, but the sprouts were unfortunately soggy & not at all roasted & crispy. The Basil Gnocchi also was delicious. I wasn't big on the gnocchi being infused, the pesto flavoring was drowned out by the red sauce as it sat surrounded by peas. The Bolognese Fries with truffle oil were the winning dish. The fries were so thin & crispy they were addictive. For sure some of the best fries I've had in Scottsdale yet. The sauce and ricotta on top paired perfectly with the truffle oil. Can't wait to come back to Pitch & try one of their pizzas or pasta that are supposed to be pretty good. Definitely coming back, however, for those fries."}
{"text":"Fun place, great food, outstanding service. Had the BLT and it came with avocado  and thick bacon SO GOOD!!!! Has great outdoor seating and a fun place for a date night."}
{"text":"Great location, the food is so-so though. Appetizer and wine selection is outstanding, but pizza and dessert was mediocre."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere and very diverse (and delicious!) menu. Would highly recommend. I will definitely be back to Pitch again very soon."}
{"text":"We tried two appetizers, pasta and pizza during our first visit. We started with truffle fries and of course got all of the sauces; ketchup, lemon garlic aioli, roasted cherry pepper, and a pesto aioli. My favorites were the pesto and lemon garlic. Then we recieved the  roasted brussels sprouts, super awesome flavor and well cooked. I had to try my two favorite aiolis and would recommend putting the pesto aioli on the brussels sprouts. As we entered the main course we got rigatoni scampi, one of the best pasta' s I have had at a restaurant. Finally the main event, our pizza,  Mia with egg overeasy on top. So good, a top 10 gourmet pizza for sure"}
{"text":"I did like this new addition to valley dining. How cool is the fact they are a scratch kitchen. The food including the Brussels sprouts are absolute FIRE. I have a pizza and the coolest part they let me put some sous viid eggs on top. Definitely something I've never done before. My god it was worth it. The cocktails need a little shaking but once you stir them up they tasted decent. Just a procedural issue i wanted to share"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.... I've passed by it a couple times since I live in the area so I suggested my friend and I check it out for dinner. The atmosphere is very romantic and modern. I ordered a chicken salad and thought it was a bit pricey and the chicken was very salty. I understand that everything is farm to table and house made but the area it's in... I think prices should be a little better. Not sure if I'll go back but it was good trying something new."}
{"text":"Foodies beware....The star is for our server and the 80s music/bar atmosphere.  The food doesn't deserve any stars.  We ordered gnocchi, onion rings and an olive bowl for appetizers.  The olive bowl was ok-I mean they opened a jar and served them up-which in hind sight was preferable to having the kitchen \"prepare\" your food but this CA girl expects exceptional chef marinated home cured olives if they're actually served as an separate appetizer and not part of a cheese/charcuterie board.  The focaccia bread on top of bowl was ok. The gnocchi dough was made properly but cut into uneven pieces and then completely ruined by a sauté of way too much balsamic vinegar.  Half of them were crunchy.  The other half soft. The plate had a bed of marinara with giant chunks of canned tomatoes-no one chopped properly or with even knife cuts.  And the marinara was only on half of the plate. This dish had peas in the mix?  Just look at pix.  Looked as bad as it tasted.  The onion rings were bland and over cooked.  We also ordered their specialty pizza.  We went for a simple margherita.  See pic.  Wow and I don't mean that in a good way  They threw whole canned tomatoes on top. The crust tasted only of charcoal in the spots which were charred otherwise bland and unseasoned.  After we were served I decided there was no head chef and no quality control whatsoever in this place.  This bar is  masquerading as a gastropub."}
{"text":"Inside Pitch it's open, bright, and airy. The patio seems like a great place to hangout on a nice day. I tried the house-made pappardelle - it was pretty good, but the noodles didn't really hang on to the loose sauce and made me feel like I need to eat it like a soup! We also had the doc pizza, this was definitely the better item! The crust was a little chewy, in a good way, and had great flavor. I will definitely go back and I suggest people try it!"}
{"text":"New to the area... went last night... it was great.... cool atmosphere... really fun and caring staff... Megan was our server... awesome service... nice wines and excellent pizza... will be taking a group back very soon to let them try it all!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was TERRIFIC! And 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sun, Mon, Tues, and HH?! Awesome!! Next we'll dine in and check out the variety of salads too!"}
{"text":"Finally have a good food spot on our little stretch of road. It's all fast food and one awesome Thai spot, after reading the reviews for The Porch over on Indian School that is also new I feel super lucky to have Pitch a couple blocks up!   Been here twice and tried two different pies, both good the Mia with mixed olives for the win though. Meatballs were good. Alfredo tortellini on point. Sliders were yummy but messy because of the sauce art but you can wash your hands. Cocktails are on point as well, wish the happy hour was 30-60 minutes longer but whatever. Tad pricy but no worse than other spots in Scottsdale and better than a decent amount to be fair.   All in all, happy camper."}
{"text":"We went Pitch for an early supper (4-ish) with my 93-year old father-in-law. Handicapped parking was open and convenient; thanks. My father-in-law ordered a Cabernet and I had one of the local beers; both great choices. We had the spaghetti and meatballs as one entry and house-made pappardelle. Both meals were delicious! Sauces were fresh, pasta was amazing, and portions were generous. I'm excited to come back and try more from their menu. The only downside was the service; after being received promptly and making great menu suggestions; our server evaporated; this was especially noticeable because at the early hour there were only two other tables with patrons. At one point I went to the kitchen to ask for something and they called the server over. Like I said, it started out fantastically but ended up forgettable service-wise. I'm going to assume we caught someone on a bad night and we'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Liked it so much I visited twice in less than a week! The outdoor patio is so lovely and the location unexpectedly awesome.   If you sit outside during the daytime, def wear sunscreen. That's good advice just about anywhere but especially so in Scottsdale. I got a lobster red nose after about an hour.  Salads are quite good and quite different. Beet and goat cheese version is huge! Be prepared to share or take leftovers home. Same for pizzas.  Please note the huge menu of mules. Regular, mezcal, all sorts of crazy combinations in a copper mug.   Would totally recommend for a group looking for a unique outdoor meal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, staff and food are on point! The beet gnocchi is absolutely stunning! I seriously thought it was stuffed with cheese but it's just magical all on its own. Eaten here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. Impressed with every experience."}
{"text":"First time here and we love the food. They are known for their pizza but we weren't here for pizza. They have an extended menu that will please almost everyone. The place is beautiful with a huge patio. So today, we had the calabrese meatball salad. It sounded odd but interesting. The meatball was moist and the salad favorable. We also ordered the soup of the day, which was a tomato base bean and chorizo with veggies. Spicy but it was so good. Definitely coming back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Patio was open, dog friendly and cute! Looks like same decor as many new places in Arcadia and Oldtown. That modern look, but it is nice! We came in an hour before Super Bowl and it was dead. It was a cute concept. We had the meatball pizza and wings. They were both good! Prices were ehhh decentish? (except for the $25 crab cakes and a few other \"specialty\" pizzas). We will definitely be back with our pup and try more things on the menu. But if they want to survive I think their prices will need to come down a bit!"}
{"text":"We've had great experiences at Pitch! Their IPA on draft is amazing and their short ribs and ribeye were both amazing, as well! This is our neighborhood \"go to\" spot. Their staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We've been looking forward to trying out this new place for quite a while. We tried appetizers where the artichoke dip was salty and the chicken wings were dry and tasteless. Three of us also had pasta dishes which were also very bland. For the four of us the bill was $156. For that kind of money my food should be delicious! I agree that the vibe is good and it was much needed in that area of town but the food really needs to step up its game."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but food was mediocre and it was overpriced for a lunch meal."}
{"text":"The environment was amazing. Service was great. I sat outside at the bar. The drinks were amazing. I definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Just sitting on this delight of a patio makes for a great meal. That the food is also downright good makes things close to perfect. I especially love that this place offers a few unexpected items such as white anchovies and peppadew. So why not five stars? For me it was poor dishwashing and for my wife slowness of service. Oh, special mention to the general friendliness of the clientele and the many cool dogs that get to join us humans here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out last night to check out a place that open up by us called Pitch. There are a lot of people there and everybody look like they were having a good time. It was our first time there and we were just kind of curious cuz we live about 2 blocks away. We were greeted by friendly staff and we told them we just wanted to have a couple of drinks and just check the place out. We opted to sit at the bar as most of the people there were sitting at tables and enjoying the meal. One of the owners named Dean came up greeted us, and asked us if we'd like to try some of their wine. The service there is fantastic. These guys really know their wines and their cocktail menu is amazing. Betsy and I split a bottle of Stella Rosa. It was delicious. They have some different prices for different options for their wines. But I can tell the people at this restaurant really care about their customers. A couple joined us at the bar. They were greeted with the same courtesy and care as we were. They ordered some food and as they were enjoying their meal they raved about about how good the food was. We plan on going back for the food as their menu look really good and it wasn't the typical crappy fair that you see in the older Old Town Scottsdale restaurants. I like the ambience of the place open air patio little fireplace it just seems like a family-friendly place. We're going to take the kids there to check out the food and see what the kids say. So consider this part one of my review but as far as I'm concerned what I saw last night this place is a huge benefit to our little southwest corner of South Scottsdale. And just a heads up to Dean thank you very much for helping us we're not wine connoisseurs but your patience and helping us with our selection and your expertise was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"out hot.   I love the idea where they brought out the large empty Italian tomatoes bin and used it as a little table for the pizza to sit on. What a good idea.   Our waiter didn't seem too social or even happy to be here.   This place is cute. Love the light fixtures. The patio is nice too. Too bad it's 100 degrees out.   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried hard to like this place because of the patio, but after 3 tries, we're giving up.   Terrible service and mediocre food.   The construction on Thomas Road makes it hard to get there, and it's not worth the trouble.  Much better choices are close--- the Vig (much better patio and great food), or Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers (40th & Indian School, or Old Town Scottsdale), or Chelsea's Kitchen (outstanding patio and outstanding food)."}
{"text":"First experience at Pitch was a great one for us! We decided to bring in the New Year with brunch at a new neighborhood restaurant, Pitch was the destination. Staff was super friendly and food was extra yummy. We each ordered the creme brulee french toast (servers recommendation.) Serving was on the smaller side, glad we ordered a side of bacon to accompany. Dining with a toddler can be challenging but we found the staff and atmosphere to be inviting. It was a huge plus that they had a nice courtyard for our little one to run off some energy.  Thank you Pitch for the great experience!"}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews, we gave this place a try last weekend. The service was decent, atmosphere is great (except for being sat at the end of a large table with a big birthday party at the other end), cocktails and food were fine, but overall everything they do is already done better by someone else in the valley. Additionally, their prices are high in comparison to the quality of food and wine (by the glass) served."}
{"text":"A very solid 4 stars...probably more a 4.5.  Came here with a party of 4. Place is super cute but I feel like they did wayyy too much outdoor seating and not enough inside. Wonder if it will hurt business in the summer.   Amazing beer and cocktail menu. They had a great blueberry beer which was dynamite. Food menu has TONS of options.   We did the truffle fries and brussel sprouts. Both were raved about with the entire table.   I had the cheese pizza and it was overall pretty good but not great. Didnt have much taste so needed some salt, olive oil and red pepper. That got it going!   Cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all and we were seated right away.   I ordered the Mia pizza. Mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, tomato sauce. It was good, but I was bummed they didn't have ranch of course. We also ordered the truffle fries to start which were good. The pizza was a pretty large size, so good to share.   The food was good, I was bummed they didn't have ranch and our waitress should be trained to be more sociable. She seemed like she didn't want to talk or smile at all. I thought it would've been busier for a Saturday. They do have a big menu though and also offer, breakfast/brunch, and happy hour. They also have a pretty cute outdoor patio too."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to get down and try Pitch! I'm so glad I did and my only regret is that I didn't go sooner! Counting down the days until my next visit.   The menu had a lot more variety than I expected.  Started off with the HH meatballs. Very good, and large for a HH portion.  Then we ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts with spicy pistachios and a pesto chicken pizza. Everything was fabulous!  Admittedly, I probably won't venture much deeper into the pizza portion of their menu. As their main dish and appetizer menu had a lot of things I'd rather try first.   Service was great and the food came out quick (almost to quick).  Very cool trendy establishment."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our experience at Pitch. We have been a couple of times for dinner at this location and the restaurant has great energy and even greater food to back it up! We tried the weekend brunch today for the first time.  We started off with a fresh squeezed orange juice and an excellent latte. The coffee flavor was very scrumptious.  Then we moved on to the entrees and we had the Short Ribs Enchilada and the Creme Brûlée Stuffed French Toast...nothing short of amazing! The flavor profiles of both were off the charts. The food never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about my experience there last night. I went on a lady date with a friend who travels for work so we needed a couple hours to hang out and catch up. Let's start with the staff, Brandon was our server/bartender and mainly helped us but literally the entire staff came by at some point (to deliver food, bring more water or pick up plates etc...) and they were all so friendly and looked like they enjoyed working there. We ordered the cauliflower in evoo, the Brussels with parmesan, goat cheese stuffed peppadews and the charcuterie board as well. All of it was great. The board had pickles, hummus, olives, nuts, meats (including duck prosciutto), cheeses and mustard. I mean, it was amazing. To top it off, Matt, the wine guy of this operation came over and we chatted about wine and he made an excellent selection for us. The wine list is fairly priced and on Sunday it's half priced bottles up til $90, then it's 25% off.  All that food and 3 bottles later and our bill was next to nothing. We had carrot cake to end the night and I seriously cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dessert on Sunday and the place was fairly dead but of course it was a Sunday evening around 7pm. It is a large space with a great outdoor patio decorated urban chic with open kitchen. The staff was great very friendly and accommodating and we were impressed with great selection of tequilas and bourbons. My husband and I shared a neat Pappy Van Winkle 15 Year Reserve which was modestly priced considering the cost of a bottle which was excellent and the bartender was nice enough to have purchase a half shot of an unusual wine barrel aged tequila which was also very good. As for the dessert it was just okay. We shared the Key Lime Pie that our server raved about it but to us it was nothing to rave about and underwhelming at best. It seemed fresh and we were told it was made in-house but seemed more like it might have come from a box with a small dollop of whipped cream on top and some kind of raspberry sauce that surrounded the dish. Based on the dessert I'm not sure if it would be worth a return trip if the other menu items are just as underwhelming which is sad because it really is a nice place."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant w/solid pizza, salads, craft beers, etc. Located in creative redevelopment w/pkg!! lgNo & fox take notice"}
