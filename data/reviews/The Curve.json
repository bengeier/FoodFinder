{"text":"Yummy local diner  Local and home spun   Kathy the waitress was wonderful!  Eggs and bacon yummy.   Conversation was terrific"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had!!!!   Everything was from scratch...unheard of anymore...but so incredibly good!!!  Always good, but best when Bill is cooking.  The portions are huge and the prices are low.   Eclectic patrons. Diner definitely has no frills, but the food is incredible!  Closes by 1pm everyday so make it there early.  The inside is a bit run-down and cramped, but the food is the best you will find anywhere!  It is always busy so cleaning is done quickly...so you may find a utensil that the washing machine missed a spot...just let the waitress know and she will quickly apologize and replace it with fresh silverware.      I whole-heartedly recommend this place for breakfast (only eaten breakfast here).  My husband and I actually have cravings for the food here....sooooo good!!!  Cash ONLY!"}
{"text":"We have been going to the Curve for many years on Park . I go there for  the food and not the ambience. The breakfasts are great the spuds are best in town. Also the Hamburgers are wonderful . The staff are friendly , always with a cheery Hello, and also a nice come back soon. Having lived in Madison wi. For all of my life.I have traveled a lot and this is what I look for ,it is just like getting off the I- system and hitting the small towns I am 75 so I just might think and look at things a little different. Keep your eyes up and don't look at floor so much."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at The Curve occasionally; I've got a friend who lives nearby, the place has a comfortable greasy-spoon vibe, and the food isn't bad. But you'd have to go way out on a limb to say they have the best breakfast in the city or anything of that nature. This is standard diner fare, done pretty well, but nothing that's gonna blow your socks off. And one has to admit that the place is a little grungy, right down to the 70's-era sign outside. A good place for a hangover breakfast, but not if you want to impress visiting family."}
{"text":"Chill, full but laid back, very small town feel which I like because Im from a small town, their food was good I was just sad they didnt have biscuits and gravy! That's the whole reason I went there cuz people were raving about it but I guess its only a special?"}
{"text":"Look.  I love a real diner/hole in the wall/greasy spoon.  But this place is just plain filthy.  God."}
{"text":"Returned to the Curve after more than 13 years on a trip to Madison. I'm so glad this small, neighborhood diner still exists. The breakfast - Denver omelette with cheese - was excellent and the service incredibly friendly. Kathy, who has worked at the Curve for 20+ years, still recognized my friend and me and greeted us with a warm hug. This quaint little diner is often overlooked, which really is a shame. Highly recommended if you like old-fashioned American diners."}
{"text":"Great old school, cheap breakfast place.  Small standard menu you can't really go wrong on, hit up the cinnamon raisin toast too."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. I have been coming here on and off for 25 years.  Booth there breakfast and lunch are exactly what you want from a diner.  My only complaint is it constantly takes a half hour to get your food and for breakfast that wait gets painful when you have to smell all the delicious food being consumed around you."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this small restaurant for many years, approximately 10 years. The food is amazing! The hash browns are perfect and crispy at the ends. Whenever I order a pancake I can't finish it so I suggest to share it- preferably love the blueberry pancake. Another reason I love coming to this place is the coffee, there is something about their coffee that keeps me away all day. The staff is super friendly and treat you like family. Oh they don't take cards, so bring cash"}
{"text":"The Curve is a Madison gem! I would call this place a diamond in the rough because you can't simply judge based on appearances. Once inside, you will experience the greatness of true American diner food. Do not expect a frou-frou breakfast or lunch but instead an excellent but basic American menu. This diner serves hands down the best French toast I have ever tasted! If you enjoy poached eggs, make sure to come before 9AM; otherwise you will have to get them basted (just as delicious). I would also recommend their omelettes, especially for you Wisco chedder lovers. Keep an eye out for their home-made corned beef hash as a special on the weekend. I wish this were offered more consistently but totally worth ordering if on special  Do not order corned beef hash during the week though because it's not home-made and probably from a can. If you're craving lunch, the burgers are a must! I would rate this place in the top 5 for Madison's best cheeseburgers. This place is perfect for those who are looking for their regular, weekly diner. Bring Cash!"}
{"text":"Great food & service. Portion large. A little pricey: food and coffee was $10 ."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had. Love the Curve Omelette that's my favorite. Haven't had the burgers yet but trying them soon. Love this place"}
{"text":"friendly atmostphere, seems like a lot of locals but was very nice to non regulars to being me food was good but there only open till 1 pm"}
{"text":"The curve is a inexpensive greasy spoon. The food is good.  You should not come here for fancy food.  The fried eggs are perfectly cooked and the breakfast potatoes are crispy on the outside.  The tables are crooked, the plastic cups are questionable at best. Exactly how a local diner should be.  As everyone has mentioned, it is cash only."}
{"text":"eh, very average. They had us packed in there like a can of sardines. Very uncomfortable seating. The only reason I think this place is so highly rated on yelp is because how cheap it is. I would rather spend a few extra dollars and get some quality food. So if your a cheap a== or broke college student, check it out. If you like quality and comfort then this place is not for you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite diners I have ever been to.   The food is fantastic - try the Denver omelette with cheese. I always got the potatoes well done and they were perfect. I left with a full stomach at a reasonable price.   Yes, it's cash only, but it's clearly marked on the door, walls, and menu, so if you can't read any of these signs before you try to pay I'm not sure what to say..."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY Great place and food for breakfast. The homemade corn beef hash was extremely good and I saw a burger come out which was a good size. I also received and was charged  for a coffee I didn't I order. Walking up to the building I had a feeling the restaurant was cash only but those notions were put to rest after I saw a No Checks sign and a Visa and Master card sticker on the front door. Only to find out at the end of  our meal it was CASH ONLY. I didn't see any of the signs for cash only that other reviews mentioned, only no checks. My friend had to run across the street to the ATM while I sat and waited. They really should just get rid of the Visa and MasterCard stickers on the front door along with the no checks sign and just have a Cash only signs."}
{"text":"I came during the week and had good service.  When I have attempted to come on weekends there was a wait, so maybe the waitresses / waiters get overwhelmed on weekends but I had a pleasant experience.  I purchased the banana walnut pancake and a side steak. The pancake was gigantic and delicious. The steak on the other hand tasted like it was on the edge of going bad, really not pleasant and a waste of 5 dollars.  I overheard the table next to successfully swap out their plate's hash browns with mixed veggies and mushrooms. Most diners are not low carb friendly so this is something to consider if you follow that type of diet."}
{"text":"I'll give it four for the food.  On my visit I found the service average and the resturante barely clean enough.  I will visit again though....;"}
{"text":"The Curve rocks! This quaint, cozy little diner is in a great location, their prices are very reasonable, everyone is so nice and the food is fantastic! Whether you have breakfast or lunch, everything is delicious. EVERYTHING! (I especially LOVE their hamburgers! I am hooked). You can either carry out or dine in. Either way, you will not go wrong going to The Curve, you'll be glad you did! :)"}
{"text":"I love diners, and I love breakfast out on the weekends.  I would love to like this place.  Food was decent.  Service was not.  And it is simply a VERY dirty place.   If they spent a half-day cleaning it, and suggested to servers to greet people and smile occasionally it would improve drastically."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! The service was even better! The chef came back out and was worried about my portion of hash brown, and tried to give me more. Even though my plate was already heaped with food! Very hole in the wall diner, but very good experience!!"}
{"text":"Quote spoken upon grabbing a seat at the bar; \"Uhhhh...when I go out to a greasy spoon place for breakfast, I don't actually want to SEE grease on my spoon!\"  This place is filthy. Dirty, dirty, dirty!   Couldn't even finish half of my breakfast for fear of what kind of dirt and grime,(bugs!) were lurking in the areas of the kitchen that I couldn't see. I am by no means a germo-phobe but, I could not get over the filth of the dining area, what I saw behind the counter, and the kitchen sight lines. A little elbow grease combined with soap, water and sanitizer could go a long way! I just can't understand how this place wins Madison best of polls, routinely. Too bad, I was hoping this could be my neighborhood breakfast place, it will not be!"}
{"text":"Came in expecting a charmingly gritty diner experience - maybe a surly server or too-strong coffee alongside greasy eggs, etc. We saw our waitress twice- once about 15 minutes after sitting down, to take our order, and once to bring us the promised water and silverware, 15 minutes later. Someone else, who I assume was maybe the cook???, came out a few times asking us if the waitress had taken our order, offered us coffee, etc.- and he's the one who actually got us coffee, refilled it, brought our silverware. it took almost an hour for our food to come. If I knew it would take so long, I wouldn't have chosen to spend that time sitting in the windowless back of a water-stained diner. I may as well have just gone out for something nicer, elsewhere.  The food was average. Not bad, not great. Meh."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I don't know how it's gotten any good reviews.  Waitress clearly had zero desire to be there or to serve us. Screaming children littered the restaurant (using that term loosely), no sausage links (only patties), omelette came out grossly under cooked, our 3 entrees all arrived at vastly different times...  Need I go on? Down shift and accelerate right past this place."}
{"text":"Uhhh... the surprise of a cash-only restaurant always catches me off guard and the fact that there was no ATM annoyed me even more (drove to a nearby gas station). BUT, it was marked clearly on the menu, so I was able to handle it before I got the bill.  A 'greasy spoon' sort of spot - I had an omelet with mushrooms, cheese (of course - it IS Wisconsin) and bacon with a side of hashbrowns. For the record, I could do without the hashbrowns next time around. BUT the amount of cheese in the omelet will have me coming back for another round (though, that may be the only reason).  The place was a little cramped, with stools that seemed unusually low to the ground. I did have the misfortune of needing to use the bathroom, I really didn't want to touch anything and feared someone coming in (I don't remember being able to securely lock the door).  I think there are better diner-esque locations to go to in Madison, but I haven't completely written this spot off."}
{"text":"I gotta give the 3 people working credit for working hard, because they do. But they need 2-3 more people to make this place work well. Service was SLOW. Food was mediocre. When asking for eggbeaters we were told it was too busy to offer them (they come in box pre-prepared so not sure why they are too difficult). Actually this place deserves a 2-3 star, but I have to give them a 1 star to get their average down so people know what they're getting into. I would not return."}
{"text":"While it's a classic corner shop breakfast stop the food was average as well as the prices and the service. I can see the charm it has on most but if you want a place to go for breakfast this wouldn't be my first choice.   However, if you grew up in the area, want a classic, low key breakfast with an old school feel, this place is probably for you. Cash only though! So don't forget that.   Happy eating"}
{"text":"The best place for your classic family style breakfast. They have HUGE servings and great prices. One note, there isn't a ton of seating and they have a small kitchen, so the food takes some time to come out, especially if they're busy. So, if you aren't in a rush and looking for a hearty breakfast, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I used to eat breakfast here every Sunday when I lived in Madison.  The place is the same as I remembered it.  Wonderful service and great food!  The American fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"You know you are in Madison when the person next to you orders a double cheeseburger with bacon at 9:30 am. I'm not that bold. Breakfast has been solid here since my first visit 25 years ago. Got to love the pancakes and French toast. Corned beef hash is fantastic. Don't miss this place.  Great to stop by before a heavy dose of tailgating.  On Wisconsin !"}
{"text":"The Curve is a no-frills kind of place. I was waiting on my wife who was at St. Mary's Outpatient Center just across Park Street and figured I needed some fresh air and lunch. I arrived right around 1230. I had the chicken tenders dinner with french fries and homemade Chicken Noodle Soup. The best part was the soup, it was nice and hearty. The chicken strips were actually pretty good. A few of he patrons sitting around me had the breakfast and it looked delicious as well. I'd maybe go back if was in that part of town and needed lunch.   Remember, it's a no frills kind of place."}
{"text":"Not the family diner it looks like. Waitress was rude and did not acknowledge our existence for nearly 20 minutes. Without menus we sat there waiting patiently. After 20 minutes another employee came over and got us drinks. The waitress after ten minutes asked what we wanted. We tell her we would like to see a menu as we had not been there before. She grabs it literally out of the hands of another customer who was actively trying to read it. After that we never heard from her again. She did however stop at the spot next to ours to tell the customer she had told the kitchen the wrong food and she wouldn't remake it. She actually told them she would not remake their food even though she messed it up. Finally we just left. The drinks have different prices which seems a little scammy too. Overall not a place I would bother with. Server was very rude, and terrible at her job. The whole place is very dirty, and no one knows the meaning of customer service."}
{"text":"I agree with Mio S. that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And I will tell you that the 1/3 lb. burger with American fries (read: hash browns cooked in bacon grease) was absolutely the right way to start off my day post-Freakfest.   It's a dive with cheap, wonderfully greasy food and an old-school style; short stools surround a u-shaped counter, there are some tables, and you might have to work for service, but overall it's friendly and perfect for preempting or sopping up those tipsy nights.   The only downers: Spotty hours (whenever food runs out or the owner/cook gets bored) & CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"This place offers no pretentions, but tons of great food. Portions are huge, and prices are good. As other reviewers have said, it wears its badge of 'greasy spoon' with pride, I think, and the cook and waitress have plenty of personality, talking and joking with regulars and newbies alike, and making sure you never see the bottom of your coffee cup.  I had today's special--a crazy-big portion of corned beef hash. One of my favorite things to order at a place like this, and I've never had it quite like The Curve made it--homemade american fries with a shredded corned beef, red pepper and some chopped greens made the whole thing so creamy and flavorful. The kind of dish I wish I could sit there all day and finish eating, but alas, I had to surrender near the end.  I'll definitely stop back in next time I'm in town--the omelets I saw get served down the counter looked pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Short:  Possibly one of the worst diners I've ever been to.  Let me start by saying that there are a few small things that the owners/operators could do to dramatically raise the quality of this place.  These things would add little/no operating costs.  Service (1/5...poor): I came in on a Saturday, it was busy and I expected service to be a little slow and it was.  I don't fault them for that.  I was quickly served coffee but it took literally 10 minutes to get cream for it and instead of milk/cream/half-half they provide a premixed disgusting non-dairy creamer.  Even McDonalds serves real cream.  I ordered the special omelet and asked to add sausage into my omelet.  The waitress rudely pointed to the bottom of them menu where it stated that no substitutions were allowed for sausage, bacon or ham.  I pointed to the part where it said \"addition ingredients $0.60\" and that I didn't want to substitute, I wanted to add.  She said she'd have to charge me $3.00 for an order of sausage, mind you that the difference in price between a cheese omelet and a sausage omelet is only $1.50 and that the $0.60 was for mushrooms/onions/peppers/etc not meat.  I said i would pay the $1.50 to add sausage, but she wouldn't back down and got quite upset.  Food:  Large portion size but poorly cooked.  It must have been the equivalent of a 4-5 egg omelet, however the onions, green peppers, and mushrooms in the omelet were completely raw.  This was quite unpleasant.  The american fries cooked like hashbrowns were quite good, however they weren't seasoned at all.  A little salt and pepper during cooking would go a long way.  The coffee was TERRIBLE.  I'm not expecting starbucks or fresh roasted coffee, but Folgers coffee is better than the stuff they served.  I can't believe with all the coffee roasters in Madison, they couldn't serve a better cup.  Atmosphere: It's a diner, I don't go there for atmosphere nor really care.  Value: Had the vegetables in the omelet been cooked and the coffee better, it would have been a good value, not great, but good.  $11 for an omelet and coffee in a diner is a little high but not excessive.  Simple area's of improvement: Cook the vegetables in your omelets State the price of adding extra meats to omelets Better coffee Cream or half-half Season the hashbrowns/fries Remove the Visa/Mastercard sticker on your door if you're not going to accept it"}
{"text":"I've had one good experience and three bad ones at The Curve. Why they deserve a 2nd star: The hash browns are home made and the best in town. Why they lose 3 stars: Every surface is covered in grease, and so I'm afraid to have my bag touch the ground. The owner is a serious grouch and yells at the super nice waitress. Today it took 20 minutes to get a cup of coffee. I eventually gave up on getting served breakfast, paid and left. I will not return to The Curve."}
{"text":"The best diner in town. No frills, shitty decor that has not been updated since the 80's. Fast service, great food, giant portions, very inexpensive. The waitress (there is only one, she's been there since the beginning) is very friendly. The daily specials are almost always the best choice. The pancakes are huge, the french toast is amazing, they do steak and eggs just right. Perfect diner coffee, hot, bitter and endless.  They have the best Ruben in town, but it is a special only available every two weeks or so.  Don't order ala carte items. Order whole dishes, the ala carte items are significantly more expensive than whole dishes.  They close at 1. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"The Curve is an institution in Madison, a pseudo-townie secret greasy spoon not far from the UW campus. They serve no-frills breakfast and lunch for shockingly low prices, and the coffee is hot and always pouring. The waitress calls you \"sweetheart,\" and fastidiously makes sure that she has every detail of your order correct and that your coffee mug is always full. There are always a few copies of the State Journal floating around the place for customer perusal. While I have very little inclination to eat sweets, I love their savory breakfasts. They always remember that I want my scrambled eggs cooked until they're dry, and their homemade corned beef hash (served only as a special; the kind that's always on the menu is not homemade, a smaller portion, and not as flavorful) is to die for. They don't have a ton of choice in toast options, and make sure to tell them when you're ordering if you don't want your toast buttered. The waitress and head chef must work in a flow state, as I've never noticed them miss a step, even when the restaurant's full and kids are running around. They keep calm and take care of everything quickly; I've never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a to-go box (and you can definitely use one on their larger breakfasts), or for one of them to make change.  The orange juice isn't the best, though, so I'd skip it unless it's a necessity for you. All in all, my favorite place to go for a solid breakfast (though they do serve lunch, too) without the circus aspect of navigating my way through hungover UW students. One important note: they're CASH ONLY, so make sure you visit an ATM before you go."}
{"text":"This is what I'm talking about. Got the eggs and hash browns when I was brutally hung over. OJ rocked but I didn't try the coffee. Bacon was good crispy, hash browns requested well done were done so- I know how important that is to some of us. Wish it was open now I would slay a plate of four eggs and a full order of hash"}
{"text":"This place is a lot like a darker, moodier Mickies Dairy Bar:  Total dive, a little unkempt, greasy spoon, diner.  Food is great, particularly if you enjoy pancakes that size of manhole covers.  I am always a big fan of bacon cheeseburgers served during breakfast time, and this place has great burgers!  Sometime this spring I plan to take my son there-the place is kid friendly enough, and the price certainly is right."}
{"text":"I love you Curve!  This is what greasy breakfasts are supposed to taste like!"}
{"text":"I have been partaking in this quaint establishment since I was knee high to a deer (is that Wisconsiny enough for ya?)!  It is a small joint with big flavor.  I am always a fan of the old school diner feel, and they stay true to it through and through.  I love me some breakfast potatoes, and they make the best in Madison.  If you are looking for a pancake, they will make them the size of your plate, and don't bother going if you are on a diet because this is downright diner food!  We are talking about HUGE portions on your plate and plenty of hometown talkin' in the air!  No apologies about it. PS: Bring cash because they don't accept credit or debit."}
{"text":"Being a frequent traveler I am always looking for good breakfast restaurants. I love the old diner feel because it reminds me of when I was young and visiting many Chicago diners. The best place to go for breakfast if you demand food that tastes good, friendly atmosphere and reasonable food expense, this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Madison's best breakfast food.  The Curve is an old school greasy spoon diner  with absolutely amazing breakfast food, for low prices.  It has a down-home feel and quick friendly service.  The typical breakfast fare such as a plate of bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast is great, but some of their special's are just out of this world.  One morning they fixed me Potatoes Luigi, and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  It was a massive plate of potatoes, scrambled eggs, Italian sausage, chopped onions and green peppers all mixed together in one glorious combination.    While not on the menu, they're famous for \"the homewrecker sandwich\" which you can request at any time.  This sandwich is a heaping helping of breakfast ham, topped with fried eggs and melted American cheese between two thick cut pieces of toast.  Eat at the Curve, you will be back for more."}
{"text":"This rating is based on greasy spoon breakfast food. Do not go here expecting fine dining or exceptional service. However, it's great all American breakfast food. My eggs are always cooked perfectly and their American fries are crispy, not soggy. Awesome place to go after a long night out."}
{"text":"No attitude or fakey crap on the walls etc... diner  atmospere - just simple food plenty of it and decent prices. Healthy maybe  it's not - but filling and damn good it is.  Owner usually on the grill and the same staff for yrs. Love the curve special omelete, good biscuits and gravy, best french toast around and pancakes are enough for 2 people. i 've never  left hungry or feeling like i didnt get my moneys worth."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and it was mediocre at best both times.   Service is absolutely terrible. They take forever to take your order, and the woman is incredibly rude. She never gave us menus and when we asked for them she told us to just tell her what we want. The dishes we got were really gross and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while.   The actual food itself is mediocre. For a little more money, you could go somewhere else and get something that is 20 times better. I ordered the eggs and corned beef hash -- the egg (because it was only one) was a tiny portion, and the corn beef hash tasted like what I imagine dog food tastes like.   The only thing I like about this place is that it's relatively cheap and their pancakes are huge. One pancake is definitely enough for a person.   I can't even say you get what you pay for because even though its cheap, it's pretty bad."}
{"text":"good old fashioned breakfast diner. big portions, free coffee refills, friendly staff, relaxed environment."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I got here at Noon. I didn't realize they closed at 1pm. I just moved to Madison today.   Smaller place than I expected. Someone should post pictures. I don't want to be that person to take a wide angle pic.   Menu is simple. Will def post pics of that. I got the 2 eggs, sausage, and American fries with toast. I really wanted a biscuit with gravy instead of toast but the server said it would cost me an extra $6.50. I decided to not get it even though it's my favorite thing for breakfast.  Quick meal and very filling. I'm definitely going to be a regular."}
{"text":"Yeah its a dive. Most definitely. But its cheap as hell and they make some mean pancakes. Opens at 6, unlike most other spots."}
{"text":"Is this a Dive? Disclaimer: I don't care for breakfast.   I will admit, I've only been once but can't wait to go back.  The decor is old school and unapologetically simple.  They give you a napkin on the table from the dispenser on the table (like......WAFFLE HOUSE), LOL.   Cooking is akin to my Uncle Sylvester (Seal). what do I mean: Big hunk of fresh baked bread. No one cares about a calorie/heart disease/belly fat/digestive issues. Just order, honey!   I got the breakfast steak and the waitress (a real adult meaning she's more than 40+) and I worked it out to just order the Lunch steak offering. Those potatoes were as chalked full of flavor & butter that I looked around for my Uncle Seal. It tasted like he was cooking.   Didn't want my bread plain with cold butter smothering it. So she took it back on a napkin from my table and had 'em grill it. Umm ummm good!  Normally, I'd be irked about cleanliness or proper manners but it's an unassuming place and you get down to earth folks - so it was ok with me. had to leave to go get cash from the UW machine @ the BP but no worries with them. get back when you can. Then she tells me, \"he makes his own bread.\" I could have proposed to him then. Instead, I'll patronize again and my sorority sister was as impressed. The Yelpers got it right all over again! Thank y'all    =^)  Oh~ I didn't think they were dirty or ill-kept. But in her defense she did come back with the bread on a small platter instead of returning with it on the same napkin."}
{"text":"This is the only genuine small-town diner in town (Monty's comes close) and one of my favorite places to grab breakfast.  It's a little dirty and the food's only good enough.  Why 5 stars?    Friendly staff and a total lack of pretentiousness.  They don't ask you for a preference on coffee blend or toast variety - and I like that.  The vibe is casual and relaxed. Other patrons aren't hip but they're plenty friendly.     Bring cash, tip well.  Long live the local diner."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  The curve guarantees you the full stomach and send you on your way to tackle the day right. What not to love about that!?  It's a small corner lot restaurant beloved by a lot of truck driver regulars (and regulars of other occupations as well). I love that atmosphere. I can always people watch and talk to a stranger at the next table as if we've known each other for a while.  My favorite is their egg dishes. The menu is not quite vegetarian friendly, so I make mine up - 2 eggs scrambles with mushroom and onion. The secret must have been the griddle - the egg just taste specially good! I don't think I can recreate that flavor at home. The pancake is HUGE. I could only finish a 1/4 of one stack."}
{"text":"This is definitely a Madison area greasy spoon cafe! Love the nostalgic low counter seating! We stopped during the morning of the Iron Man competition. There were a few others in grabbing some food to take to the race sidelines and a few others who stopped in to get out of the cooler morning weather. We started with a cup of coffee. I was very surprised that their regular drip coffee is really good. They source it well. I had the corned beef breakfast. It was spicy and greasy and gave me a little bit of a stomach ache after a while. The flavor was good, but maybe a little too greasy for me that day. My friend ordered the oatmeal with cinnamon and raisins and that was really good! I saw a couple of other plates and breakfast sandwiches walk by that looked pretty appetizing. The parking is a bit tricky if there's an event near by. We found ourselves a parking spot about 2 blocks away. A great excuse for a short walk. Next time I may go with oatmeal or a sandwich option. I hear the pancakes are incredible too."}
{"text":"The Curve has freaking huge pancakes! The pancake hung over the sides of the large oval plate. A huge glob of butter was melting in the center of the pancake when it was served. Also, I had a side of sausage which were two large sausage patties. OMG! The largest pancake that I have ever had was on the Hawaiian island of Maui. There is a small Maui restaurant that serves huge pancakes and the pancakes at the Curve are very similar. Oh by the way, the Curve's pancake was very good too!   The service was first class. I didn't catch the name of the waitress but she was great. She handled the entire diner restaurant that seats about 40 people. She took the orders, served drinks, delivered the food and ran the cash register. I even saw her washing dishes. By the way, they only take cash, so leave the credit cards at home. The diner is located on a corner of a busy street, in a curve, near the University of Wisconsin campus. If you like breakfast you need to get down to the Curve. I highly recommend it.  My ticket, before tip, was $10 (cash)."}
{"text":"Don't let the greasy spoon look scare you away. The food is all amazing, portions are ginormous, the coffee cup is infinitely deep, and the mom and pop who run this place may initially seem uninviting, but are super friendly and provide great service (if they seem short, they're just busy!) There's no better place to spend a weekend morning than eating breakfast sitting on one of the red cushioned stools at the Curve's bar. Your prissy friends won't like it (as some of the reviewers below attest), so just leave them at home!"}
{"text":"had a great breakfast there yesterday(1/07/13)--both ordered the biscuit/gravy special that comes with 2 eggs and hashbrowns.  Sunny side eggs were cooked perfectly, hashbrowns were crispy homemade shreds of tasty potatoes, the biscuits/gravy were kinda different with a brown gravy filled with sausage and biscuits were unique and all was great Its just a casual diner with a waitress and cook that both are good at what they do--will stop again next time n Madtown"}
{"text":"A great stop here in Madison. This is clearly a locals favorite. If your looking for a good diner with lots if food and good service, this is your spot. The decor is simple and reminds you of \"middle America\". The waitress was very friendly and accommodating to our slightly complicated ordering. It is cash only so be sure to stop by an ATM if need be. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Our service was... not great. However I'm still giving them a 4-Star rating because the food was really good.  I may have been thrown off by the fact that we walked in the door and no one greeted us by saying hi, or telling us we could sit wherever. But we figured it out.  I may have also been uncomfortable with the fact that we sat at a table near the window where there were three trays of liquid for catching fruit flies... that were full of dead fruit flies. But I guess it's been than in our food.  We ordered after the waitress came over about 20 minutes into being there. Our food also took at least 30 minutes to come out.  If you're in a hurry or are turned off by dining with unshowered college kids, probably don't eat here.  If you're fine with a limited menu of greasy spoon goodness with a classic \"indifferent attitude\" approach to customer service, check it out. It's an experience. And it was really good. I was hungover... but it hit the spot!  We also had to wait quite awhile to pay. Like... a long time. Set aside an hour or two to dine here. But I still recommend it. For some reason, it's charming."}
{"text":"Menu has a good selection of breakfast and lunch items. Coffee is hot and they keep it coming. My eggs were scrambled nicely and they grated cheddar on top as I requested. The ham steak was tasty, the toast buttered and my home fries expertly cooked. Good, divey little diner."}
{"text":"To me The Curve is the classic greasy spoon diner and one of my favorite places to grab breakfast in the Madison area. The curve burrito is great (especially the fresh tomatoes) and the BEWARE the pancakes are huge! :) If you're looking for a nice fancy breakfast this is not the place for you. But if you're looking for some tasty, buttery, greasy, no-frills goodness, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down - my favorite greasy spoon brunch spot in Madison.  Good prices, delicious food, and good company.   Some people may find the staff gruff, but I love them and they treat their regulars incredibly well. You might have to wait a while for food when it is busy, but where is that not the case?   The bar provides a great environment to have conversations with your fellow brunchers and the staff. Be prepared to talk about recent events with other patrons!"}
{"text":"This quaint little breakfast dive is conveniently nestled next to a tattoo parlor and across the street from the hospital. While I was here I did overhear a woman asking when the tattoo shop opened so maybe it really is convenient. And I'm sure the food wasn't great for my arteries so the hospital could come in handy, but all in all I loved it here.   It's a cash place, people can whine about it all they want but walking past the place no one should be surprised. My counterpart got the pancakes and each one was bigger than his head. I had the namesake omelette which came with home fries and toast. I'll be getting the same when I return.   But let's be honest people we all go to these divey diners because the coffee is great and the people work there are down to earth or so perfectly sassy. And let me tell you, the coffee was hot, tasty, and never ending. And our server Kate was a real sweetheart with just a little attitude to keep us on your toes."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you want a big plate of food. A BIG plate of food. Food that tastes good, but also soaks up the booze boiling in your stomach, or to prepare for the day ahead without pretense. The waitress will take care of you, as long as you don't bullshit too long.  This is not the place to worry about whether or not your breakfast is gluten free or vegan-friendly. This is the place when you want to hunker down in your carhartts, fill your belly, and smile at your neighbors.  It's ok. No one will bite you. And that omelette you ordered? Be prepared to feel guilty for not finishing it."}
{"text":"Generous portions, does all the basic breakfast items right (e.g. pancakes, eggs  etc.) Their burger is pretty good as well."}
