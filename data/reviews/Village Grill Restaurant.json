{"text":"This was my first and also the last visit of this place. I was disappointed by the service and the food. The waitress wasn't friendly at all. I ordered breakfast menu, but every part of it had something I didn't like - potatoes were undercooked, eggs too greasy and undercooked and sausages burned. Also the water tasted strange. Sirup provided to pancakes was so watery, that I suspect they mixed it with water to reduce costs.   With the price for breakfast similar to the restaurant across the street, it is not worth to come here."}
{"text":"We had a horrendous experience just parking in front of this establishment!  The owner/chef came running out screaming at the top of his lungs like some hysterical animal - because we misparked.  This is an abusive person and stay away - especially if you are a woman!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today since it was close to home and expected a sketchy experience. Wait staff were nice, food was what you would expect of a small town diner."}
