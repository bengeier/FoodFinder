{"text":"Went to Porte Grecque again reluctantly, it was my sister's birthday. This place was  good about fifteen year ago especially when there were no Greek restaurants in the west island, somehow their food has lost its taste over the years.. The food was just too greasy, service was kind of slow. We started with the over fried vegetables zesty pikilia platter, made me feel queasy later.  The Calamari was also too greasy and soggy. I had the lamb chops, scallops covered in bacon and scampi, with a salad that looked like it came out of  bag and I barely touched it. Lamb chops were okay, so were the scampi and scallops, but I would no go to this restaurant on my own free will. My nephew loves this place, as he says you get a good bang for your buck. This is an average Greek place kind of on par with Casa Grecque, if that's your thing, go ahead and enjoy. One more thing they seated us upstairs, but on Feb 18, 2012 it was 25Â° outside and it was boiling up there however in winter it is pretty cosy."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Stupidly ordered the scallop brochettes. For the price I should not have expected real scallops. It was obviously flavoured Pollack with bacon wrap. They took it away when I called them on it and I settled for a nice Spanokopita with trimmings. will not return!"}
{"text":"Being a 35 year experience Chef, it takes a lot for a restaurant to impress me. Tonight, Les Porte Grecques  did just that, a simple menu with no pretense, a clean service with a smile. Some of the most simple dishes prepared by the hands of what seems to be one of the greatest master chef of Montreal. If you never tried Les Portes Grecques you have not taste real food yet.  Cannot wait to be back to Les Porte Grecques."}
{"text":"Pure crap. You're better off eating grass at the curb. All the food is full of MSG, over cooked, soggy. Terrible service. Yet it's packed. What people won't do for a $12.99 meal and bring their own wine. Ridiculous !"}
{"text":"Great meal....what a way to start off the new year 2014. The only thing that I did not like was the parking.but all in all everything else rocked. LIFES GOOD!"}
{"text":"T'was a birthday dinner for my aunt meaning 15 people were needed to be seated comfortably. Porte Grecque has got this down! They have plenty of large tables for large groups, even a second floor full of them. For an 8:15 reservation we had to wait about 20 minutes. Even once we got to the table they were still setting up around us with cups, cutlerly, menus, etc. Which is fine. I mean, I'd rather wait at the table than wait in the crowded front of house but next time, give the menus first! Otherwise, that's just a tease.   Appetizers were ok. The garlic bread could have been more evenly garlic-y and the cold appetizer platters were just ok. More tzatiki needed. I also had a white bean soup of the day that was lacklustre. Just like a consume with small beans, lentils and vegetables sunk at the bottom. Not the hearty thing one would expect!   My meal also fell a bit flat for me. For starters, my fillet mignon was not the desired medium rare or even close to that. I'm not picky! But that was medium well. I whole heatedly enjoyed the Greek rice and potatoes. Both were perfectly cooked and flavourful. The salad that came along took up half the plate could have used a kick of feta cheese but was all right.   Desserts were presented on platter and the options were seemingly endless. I wonder if they make all/any of them. I tasted the apple pie and the cheesecake. The apple pie was yummy, a little more soft than I'm used to but great with the scoop of vanilla ice cream. The cheesecake was a lot to handle with the overload of chocolate but pretty good too.   I've got to hand it to the servers! They did a great job getting to everyone, handling so many varying orders and never letting the little things slide. It's a shame that the food fell a bit short with me but for the ranging tastes and large number, it worked for our occasion."}
{"text":"Great cozy ambiance and charming waitress who chicken in on how we were doing quite often. Food was affordable and quite good for the price. I had the lamb for $15. Bread was complimentary."}
{"text":"As a Greek native I found the food to be sub par. The lamb chops were overcooked and overpriced. There calamari leaves much to be desired. There are much better Greek restaurants in Montreal, Elounda and Mythos come to mind. But if you must stay in the West Island and want to eat Greek, La Porte Grecque offers a decent Greek fare."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 15 coworkers.  We were seated upstairs and it was extremely hot. Everyone was complaining and we all left as soon as we could. There was one window behind us which we tried to open but it was sealed shut. We asked the waiter to open the door in the corner for some air and he said it was already open.  Which it wasn't.  However, the food was very good. I started with tzaziki and garlic bread, cheese pie and spanakopita.  For my main meal I got a  filet mignon brochette and everything was delicious.  The only thing I noticed from the last time is that the meat portion was a lot smaller. Everyone elses plate had a decent portion of meat though so it might have just been a mistake. The prices are good the food is good and it's byow. I will be going back just never sitting upstairs again."}
{"text":"Will not return. Bugs all over table inside and owner kept saying he saw nothing. Pic worth a thousand words. Horrible food and service not so good. Don't eat here. We left our food on plates."}
{"text":"Went to Porte Grecque last night for the first time and was not too impressed.    First of all I want to start by saying the only thing that made us go to this restaurant were the nice patios in a cozy setting under some trees.  We thought it would be a nice place to sit outside and enjoy a nice meal.  Well, you know what they say, \"don't judge a book by it's cover\".    We were seated on the edge of the patio right and quickly realized all we heard was the loud street noise of passing traffic.  That's ok, but what was really annoying is that people outside can smoke (we just moved here from the US and not used to it) so you smell second hand smoke while eating.  Lovely Quebec, catch up to the times. (but that's another story)  Now to the food..  We ordered the Calamari Appetizer plate to share, I ordered the Lamb Chops and my wife ordered the souvlaki plate.    Calamari arrived in a reasonable time, but the were very greasy, soggy, and bland.  No taste whatsoever!!  They were coated in some sort of sauce, even after I squeezed some fresh lemon on them they still lacked flavor.    *Strike 1*.  Then came our entrees.  My wife's slouvaki plate  --- Had a long hair on it.  *Strike 2* Then she let cut open the pork and it was raw in the middle.  *Strike3*    She sent it back and waited another 10 minutes while she watched me eat.  ( I offered her some of my Lamb, but she does not like Lamb).  The waitress return with the Souvlaki and did not even apologize, just dumped the plate in front of my wife.  Came back after 5 minutes and asked: \"Is it better?\" with no hint of politeness to be found.  Somehow I think she took it personally that the pork was raw.  Lastly , my Lamb chops, were served over a bed of yellow rice and cheapy iceburg lettuce with what looked like some sort of Kraft salad dressing.  Actually Kraft sald dressing has flavor, this one lacked it.  The chops were alright, but again, lacked flavor, and very rubbery tasting.  Grossed me out a bit since I was chewing forever.. *Strike 4*   In order to compensate for the lack of flavors, we order a $2.75 scoop of tzatziki sauce which at least provided some sort of excitement.  Total bill was $51 tip included..  needles to say, we will not be returning to this restaurant..  Plus the sad thing about this is that Marche Adonis is right across the street and they have the most heavenly marinated brochetts and tzatziki  sauce for 1/3 of the cost.."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times over the years. I always found the food fair. I don't go home a brag about how great my meal was, but I'm not totally disappointed like a few others have reviewed here."}
{"text":"I went to Porte Greque tonight for my first time tonight (Monday Night) and I was very dissatisfied. I went because I had a coupon--2 meals, each with soup and dessert for 20$--that I received for supporting a local sports team. The soup of the day was white bean soup. It was okay but nothing special. I ordered the Shish Kabab; marinated pork tenderloin skewered with onions and green peppers. I have to admit that the pork was very good and moist, but the kabab had only 2 tiny pieces of pepper and 3 tiny onion pieces. The salad was an obvious cheap-out. A huge bed of iceberg lettuce with a quarter of a tomato, a few cucumbers, and barely any dressing. (Was it a store-bought dressing? I don't know... I could barely taste it over the blandness of the iceberg.)  The rice was the standard yellow rice that is served at so many other Greek restaurants. The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside but bland on the inside. There were no choices for dessert other than chocolate cake. It was okay, but I am not a huge fan and would have liked something other than chocolate cake.  The service was okay; our waitress was friendly and helpful. Parking was not an issue because it is a private lot."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant in all of  Montreal! Home made style Greek food with unbeatable prices!  Their home baked potatoes are always moist with a hint of lemon. Their feta and tzatziki is fresh and full of flavor.  I also love their cozy atmosphere and the fact that it's bring your own wine. They've been open for years and I try to make it at least once a year when I'm back in Montreal. It's really that good!  FYI - Their website says they're open weekdays until midnight but in reality they close around 10:30PM. They're open late on weekends though."}
{"text":"Ok...I stomp on my words.   Service was fantastic this round. The host was wonderful and accommodating and the food was even better.  Vegetarian from NYC was please with her fried zucchini and spanikopita. The other 7 were blown away by the portions and how fresh everything was.   For the first time I had the scallop bacon brochette and I don't know if I can  ever eat scallops another way again   So..reviewed my review..tasty and pleasant! !"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner and received some pretty bad service. The food was very average. The wait staff seemed frustrated to be working that day. I had to ask for water 4 separate times. The owner seemed more concerned that our table with seating for 6 had only 4 people on it, than the lack of service his restaurant provides customers. The most amusing part was the restaurant was nearly empty. This place is dark and dingy and you feel like you are having dinner in a dungeon. My first and last time eating here."}
{"text":"Food decent, but don't ever leave your camera there and call to see if they found it.  I was told I must have left it somewhere else.  I insisted I left it there because I remembered just that. I got hung up on.  Twice. Management and owner are total d-bags!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and service is quick. The restaurant is a bit small but it makes for a cozy atmosphere. Wait staff and owner are quite nice, checking up on you to make sure everything is as you ordered. Try the Assiette du Village. It comes with two pieces of steaks, two quails, two lambs chops, two sausages, salad, rice and potatoes, all for less than 20$! You can get an extra piece of lamb if you don't want sausages."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food is so amazing, fresh, and authentically Greek. I also love the cozy ambiance. It looks like a cute little cottage. I never feel like I am at a restaurant there. I feel like I am eating at a person's house! Love the service and food!"}
{"text":"Yummy food but dated decor. Staff were nice. Quite a bit of selection on the menu. Suggestion is take your family but not your date"}
{"text":"I have my favorite restaurants and my favorite dishes from around the world......dishes that I talk about to everyone I know and restaurants that I MUST visit while I am in town and this is definitely one of them!!!  I thought this restaurant was unique, cozy and very charming!!  I love the fact that you can bring your own wine and they will cork it for you (not many restaurants like that around)!!!   The food is good and the calamari is simply the best that I have had anywhere!!  I can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"FranÃ§ais aprÃ¨s -  I think 2 stars is a bit too harsh and I think 3 stars is too much. 2 1/2 would be my real score. the strongest part of the meal I had there? the price. This place is cheap, you can get out of there for less than 20$ especially on Special days. Otherwise, the food is utterly ordinary, the service without heart and obviously a place to bring an unsecure grandma that have been there 20 times or be lazy and organize a birthday there instead of a more decent place. So overall, it's just a boring typical menu with cheap chicken dry rice (you know the yellow one that tastes like Lipton soup?). Chicken overmarinated in a sauce to hide the lack of freshness. Overall a place to go when uber depress and without a penny AND in this area.   Je pense que c'est un peu trop cruel que de juger un 2 Ã©toiles pour cette place et trop gÃ©nÃ©reux de mettre 3 Ã©toiles. Je mettrais rÃ©ellement 2 1/2 Ã©toiles.  L'aspect positif de cette place? C'est le prix! C'est en bas de 20$ pour un lunch lÃ . Surtout durant les speciaux. Sinon le service est amateur et l'ambiance est celle D'un resto ou t'amÃ¨nes ta grand-mÃ¨re insÃ©cure qui n'aime pas essayer de nouveaux endroits et qui a manger lÃ  une vingtaine de place. Sinon c'est un endroit ou on fait un party de fÃªte Ã  un ami que l'on aime pas trop et surtout pour qui on ne veut pas trop se casser la tÃªte pour trouver un meilleur endroit (aussi cher).  En fait, c'est vraiment un resto nul avec un menu typique avec le typique riz sec qui goÃ»te la soupe lipton et du poulet marinÃ© (un peu trop) qui sert Ã©videmment Ã  cacher la fraicheur douteuse. En gros, c'est vraiment un endroit dÃ©primant ou pour y retournÃ© il faudrait que je sois coincÃ© dans le coin, avec une faim de loup, sans trop d'argents dans les poches."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal on July 29th, 2016.  We had a group of 15 people for dinner that evening at this restaurant.  There were 3 of us in the group that ordered the Bacon Wrapped Scallop entrÃ©e.  When the entrÃ©e came out we found out that the bacon wasn't wrapped around scallops at all, it was IMITATION SCALLOPS (think imitation crab, the bright pink stuff)!  We called the owner over to tell him about what he had found.  He had the audacity to tell us that he just prepares and sells us what his seafood supplier gives him.  Look at the pics, it is so obvious that it WAS NOT scallops at all.  It was flakey and rolled out in sections just like the imitation crab sticks.  It is outrageous and comical that this place can charge people $16.00 for a plate of lies!  DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE!  Who knows what other meats are fake here."}
