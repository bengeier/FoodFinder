{"text":"The sea food is good. A bit over priced but that might be because we're not near a beach. I love the Pollo asado here!! It is the best!! If you're looking to get some meat for a bbq the owner also owns the place next door where the sell amazing beans, chicken, meat and raspados."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  Went there with family and they literally had no one in there when we came in with a group of 10.  They took over 5 minutes to come to our table to even say hello and get our drink order which, no exaggeration, took nearly 10 minutes.  We had all already figured out what we wanted and asked if we could just place our order at that point but the server said he had to go greet another table of a couple guys that just came in.  So he goes takes care of them instantly and gets their drinks them comes back to our table to take our order.  The people we had contact with including the server were unbelievably rude.  BEYOND RUDE, THE WHOLE TIME.  The other table that was served promptly had already received their appetizer shrimp cocktail and their main course before we ever even saw our food.  I told my dad, whose idea it was to come, that I wasn't interested in the mistreatment and lack of service.  I left $4 for my soda and left.  At that point it was literally 45 minutes from placing our order.  My family hung around for another 15 minutes then they too left.  

These people here do not like Chicanos, trust me.  Unless you're a straight up Mexican from the other side of the soon to be wall, these people don't want your business.  Don't give it to them."}
{"text":"Nice staff, but I can't say I'd return. The food was mediocre. We had steak tacos as our appetizer. Good flavor. We ordered fish filets. Nothing to talk about.  Staff is Spanish speaking only.  Menu is in both Spanish and English.  $41 for two people.  I was overcharged by 3.88, not sure why.  I didn't say anything cause I kinda just wanted to leave.  Very nice people though."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican experience. The atmosphere took us back to Playa Carmen. We ordered the sopas, one chicken one bean and they were yummy! I'm sad that I forgot to take a picture before we dug into them. The lettuce, tomato and crema were very fresh. 

Service was attentive, the place wasn't spotless but we weren't looking for sterile, we were looking for real and we found it here.

The place was filled with locals and that's always a good sign! We will be back when we visit the area again."}
{"text":"Gross absolutely  gross.  We ordered oysters , fish burrito , Carne asada burrito , and popcorn shrimp. I will say this the oysters were huge but after eating the other items I refrained from eating all the oysters but managed to try 2 not that bad.  I was more scared to eat the rest of the oysters  after tasting the hard Carne and dry rice in my burritos.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ok so I grew up on the east coast where whole in the wall, mom and pop restaurants are a staple and always the best kind of find. But I'm not going to lie, out here on the west coast bad experiences have made me skeptical. However I give credit where credit is due and I feel like it is appropriate to give to this place. 

Now let's be realistic first... the under water decor is atrocious, the music is \"authentic\" which usually isn't my cup of tea, and the waitress didn't speak much english but hey, how much is needed when you can point to a menu? 

However, if you are looking for a huge burrito for under 6 bucks that is packed with flavor this is your place! I come here when I want to get stuffed! I have many a time made the mistake of coming here on my lunch break and then wanting to nap in my car. The salsa that is served with complimentary chips is also homemade, fresh, and delicious! There is also a plethora of sauces available to adorn your dish, and to a girl who likes her condiment choices that is right up my alley! Couldnt give more stars just because I haven't tried more menu items but I would recommend."}
