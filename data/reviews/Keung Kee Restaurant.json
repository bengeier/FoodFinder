{"text":"It's my first time writing review on Yelp. But I am so disgusted by the dish I had for take out so I have to speak out. It's just a bowl of brown thick goo with a little ribs, bell pepper and onion pieces. The ribs and veggie tastes weird and a little bit bitter. And my throat felt itchy after tasting it. What my bf had is also terrible. Definitely one of the most horrible food I had for my entire life!"}
{"text":"I used to come here occasionally but I will not be back. The service here isn't that great to begin with. Even during non busy hours the workers are slow and do not pay much attention so sometimes you really have to wave them down to get their attention...which is annoying. But I would come back because the food was good.   Well, things have changed. It seems that the prices are going up for the dishes but the quality of the food is going down. With so much choices out there it's definitely not worth putting yourself through such crappy service for mediocre food."}
{"text":"a very solid 4.5 to 5 star restuarant.  service was fast and friendly, food was delicious, and prices are right.  i recommend their brand name chicken porridge, mixed cow intestines, and their even their complimentary soup was good.  my bf and i went here for dinner, for 60 bucks, we had super delicious super-seized shrimp, noodles, and several other plates.   very good food!  if we are ever back in toronto, would go again."}
{"text":"We come here once a year the day we drive up from New Jersey to Toronto on our yearly trip to Canada. Why? My grandma really likes it here.  Every year I can't say I've been disappointed by the food. The service is always very friendly and the dishes satisfying and delightful. Flavors are always very delicate, unlike many Chinese restaurants which bombard you with sweetness or sourness. Try the jook (rice porridge) and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Always hits the spot. Great soft shell crab. Service isn't the friendliest but its fast. You have your most popular honkkong items on the menu."}
{"text":"Stop reading and just go because their food will blow you away. Seriously, stop and go in already. I cannot describe how excellent their dishes are. I...just...can't....!!  Bonus: they close at 1:30am so that's definitely worth the rating cuz good food at late hours is hard to find, here here!"}
{"text":"Came here around 9 pm and waited about 15 minutes for a table. There was a piece of food on the seat and I kindly asked the server to wipe it away before we were seated. She gave me one napkin and told me to do it myself in a rather haughty manner. The typical bad service is just as I remembered (i hoped things would have improved but guess not).  I ordered the large seafood congee and both taste and texture were still good.  We tried a spicy chilli beef in a wrapped waffle cone shape and it was predominatly cumin, chilli peppers and star anise.  The stir fried noodles with beef and veggies was good. Not too oily.  Fried pig intestines were crispy, not overloaded with fat and a decent portion.  Stir fried bok choy using ginger and garlic was a decent taste, nothing too fancy.  Overall the food was good and the prices decent but service is sadly lacking like many other restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beyond 5 stars! Seriously, I hardly give any 5 stars and this is above 5 stars!  I'm from New York and my cousin brought me here last year in May. I loved it! I've been wondering what is the english name of this restaurant. Finally, I found it! :D  The \"jah seen lai\" aka fried milk (literally) was my favorite!!!!!!! After I had my first jah seen lai there, I was looking for it in NY. However, the fried milk I had in NY was not as good as the one in Keung Kee. The fried milk from Keung Kee was amazing!!! In addition, the drinks were good, too! I had the red bean + vanilla tapioca. Delicious.  So thanks to the yelper who reviewed this restaurant first. Cuz I would not know the address. I want to come back to this place again!! :)"}
{"text":"After watching the Fourth of July fireworks display at the US-Canadian border at Niagara Falls, I came to Keung Kee, after a 2-hour drive, for a midnight snack. The congee was nice and thick; it had the right consistency for congee, relatively filling. The fried chicken wings were nice too, they were pretty light and crispy.  On a different note, I found the atmosphere to be very fitting for a midnight snack. The music was soft and very pleasant. The waiters, who were ready to go home since it closes at 1, gave my table a fair amount of attention."}
{"text":"So after reading Precilla C. review, I decided to try this location.  I've been to their Hwy 7 / Kennedy location few times and the food was 'OK'.  Once I got to the restaurant I totally forgot what to order...lol.  Ended up getting:  1) Big bowl soup 2) Noodles with spicy shredded pork 3) Spicy Chilly steamed fish  I just made those names up...but they all have pictures.  1)  Soup is the same as the other location, nothing to brag about, just very fresh and delicious.  2)  Even though it was suppose to be spicy pork, it tasted sweet.  not spicy AT ALL.  it comes with a bowl of msg hot water (i think they call it soup).  Which the waiter spilled over the table and one of the chair.  3)  Fish itself was good, but they used the flavorless chilies, no taste.  SERVICE:  This place have one of the WORST service.  Went at 8:00pm on a wednesday, restataurant was 60% empty and they had 3 waiters that have a very unique skill of walking around without looking at you.  Sort of like AYCE Japanese restaurant.  Had to wait 15~20min before we could flag down a retarded fat ass lazy waiter.  Since i don't speak cantonese, i was ordering in english and he would yell out loud the dish i wanted in Cantonese....in a signing tone...WTF???  When he brought over the #2) dish, he spilled half of it on his hand, table and chair beside me...no big deal.  BUT ATLEAST CLEAN IT UP!!!.  When he brought over the #1) and #3) i asked him each time to clean that up, he just rolled his eyes.  I finally had to flag down ANOTHER WAITER (which was a challenge itself) to clean it up.   Anyways, bill came up to $30ish+, left him $0.01 tips.  P.S.  The staff in Kennedy/Hwy 7 is MUCH friendlier"}
{"text":"Okay food nothing stood out for me but the decor and plating was nice. They have a handful of dishes you wouldn't normally find at other restaurants which is great.  The prices are average.  We had the lo mein,it was okay the soup seemed to be lacking flavor but the toppings (I had the beef delicacies) were flavourful and good.  The chili oil is soo good though."}
{"text":"Out of all the Keung Kee locations, my family prefers the one in Midland...and for good reason. We were pleasantly surprised yesterday at this restaurant since it has undergone a renovations, which means it is roomier, spacious, and chairs that are comfortable to sit in. We were a gang of 9 and we ordered quite a lot of dishes, and it all came out to $100 or so, so this place is definitely worth the money.  Food. Typical Chinese (although I am not sure what region...sorry!) but very delicious, perfect if you are really hungry. Some of the tastier dishes are the Fried Egg with Bitter Melon, Clams in Curry Sauce, Fresh Fish (to the end of the room there is a fish tank where Nemo could end up on your plate), and Fried Milk (omg). Don't worry - the menu's come with the signature pictures with English captions...and the pictures highlighted are often the most popular dishes so rest assured, you could just point to all the pictures on the menu and you will have a ball.  Ambiance. Clean. Efficient. Can be busy at times.  FYI. Great for large groups as it is relatively inexpensive for the quantity of dishes you can order, and it's all sooo good!"}
{"text":"Keung Kee Restaurant is seriously the most overrated places I had ever been too and the reviews here say otherwise.   I find it astounding that people think this place is great, sure the food is good but the service is terrible. It took them awhile to get my order and food despite the restaurant looking less busy and they still screwed it up. I had ordered their Keung Kee Chicken Congee (their speciality congee) and it took them around half a hour to bring it; seriously congee should be the first thing that they will bring.  What's even worse is that I wanted chinese doughnuts to compliment with the congee but they didn't even bring it until the end when I was full. Also they screwed up my order and thought that they are clever enough to add something that I didn't order.   Horrible Service and decent food, the decor may look enticing but don't go to this restaurant...."}
{"text":"Canto food that has enough 'wok hay'. This place is super tasty and I love the fact that it is both a family style restaurant and 'cha can teng' (tea diner).   This place is 4.5 stars but yelp doesn't have this option... It lost half a star because the signature dish of the Keung Kee, the chicken congee, is not too flash. Check out my food blog on my profile for more detail and photos!"}
{"text":"Ok, well now that I can actually think straight and am not all delusional or sick, I can write a more full review of Keung's.    Upon careful reflection, I must say that their congee really sucks!  They don't use deboned chicken (to my surprise).  I will vouch though, and say that Keung's is not as heavy on the MSG (which is probably a good thing if you're sick!)  However, from a flavour perspective, when I'm sick, I prefer Congee Wong's congee as there is a certain indescribable congee-goodness in every bowl!  Other items I've tried at Keung's that I think are amazing:  Wonton Lo Mein:  Definitely generous with the filling of shrimp and pork, and the lo mein was very flavourful... I am craving a bowl right now!  However, I will say that it wouldn't kill them to throw in some greens (bok choy, even lettuce?!)  Street Vendor Cheung Fun:  Steamed Rice Noodles sprinkled with sesame seeds with Peanut/Hoisin Dipping Sauce. DEEEEE-lish!  The rice noodles are nice and soft, and piping hot (so don't burn yourself from not being able to wait a minute longer to devour it!)    So OVERALL, Keung's gets a 4 out of 5.  If you are going to get their congee, stick with the fish congee, as it is infinitely better than the chicken one (where you could potentially be choking on some chicken bones!)"}
{"text":"Well, not all restaurants can't be good as others. Keung Kee used to have an amazing reputation for their food and customer service. But after today, all good things have to come to an end.  I was very disappointed with the food quality and service my family received today for our lunch. The food portions were decent, but they were not executed to proper standards. Although there was a complimentary drink if you order an item over $5.99 before 2:30 p.m. , it was not worth it due to the long wait time for a simple dish like Stir Fried Turnip Patties, and honestly, it was the worst one I have eaten in my life. Honestly, I would not be returning in the near future unless certain changes are made."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and left feeling happy with a wonderful meal.  Food: Fried Chilli Turnip Patties 4/5 - not the cheapest item on the menu but it was great and there were also pieces of shrimp in it which I didn't expect  Preserved Egg and Lean Pork Congee 5/5 - The portion was meant for one person and there were 3 of us. It was so good we should have ordered a second bowl but we had a lot of other food to get through  Fried Rice Noodle w/Sliced Beef & X.O. Sauce  4/5 - Wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but none the less it was great and came with a lot of beef in my opinion  Home Made Juicy BBQ Pork 4/5 - the pork was pretty fatty but the sauce was great and I didn't mind the fat.   Service: 4/5 We came here on a late afternoon so didn't have to wait for a seat and we were greeted right away and felt welcomed. We were offered our choice of seating. The staff were friendly and attentive. For those who don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, of note is that the staff speak English very well also."}
{"text":"Very good...I am a fan of keung kee....they maintain a good quality of food"}
{"text":"Great for noodle and rice dishes. Done really well - jook too. Fast!"}
{"text":"This place is a great Chinese restaurant for lunch classics like rice and noodle dishes, but it's especially a great pick for dinner since they have good quality and yummy dishes, plus free dessert soup. I come here when I have a craving for roast pigeon and always leave satisfied. The fried turnip patties are also delicious.   The decor is better than average for a Chinese place and service is decent. Food is consistent and the price is right!"}
{"text":"The service was really good, was seated and serviced instantly, went around 4pm ish. Im not really a fan of this type of food, im more used to \"buffet style\" chinese food. So it would be unfair for me to make any remarks. I had that yellowish chicken that you see in all the pictures and garlic beef on broccoli. I really enjoyed the beef. I wanted to go to mandarin but my chinese friend insisted on here. Not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Came with five others today. Four of us decided to share dishes. We got a scrambled egg and beef rice noodle, a preserved meat sticky fried rice, and a plain rice noodle. Scrambled egg and beef rice noodle was delicious. Portion was large as well. Preserved meat sticky fried rice was decent, but the portion was a tad smaller. Plain rice noodle is one of their specialties, and as always, it was well done. I love how they serve it with skewers. Heads up, the sauce is peanut, not sesame.  For the two who chose not to share, I heard the satay beef instant noodle was good, but that the portion was smaller than it used to be. I also heard that the mango milkshake was very mango-y.  Their teacups are not traditional Chinese tea cups. They're now plastic and citrus colored. They're lovely pops of color."}
{"text":"MochiPopcorn Rating Chart Averaged 5 Star Rating rounded down.   Time: 7pm Date: Typical Wednesday Party: 2 Time to Seat : Instant Crowd Level : Medium  Food / Quality Rating - 4 / 5  1st Dish : White pepper pork bone marrow soup with mustard greens, carrots, corn, radish, chinese mushrooms and tofu puffs.  This soup is one of the signature dishes. 1st time visitors should try this dish. Soup seemed like it was boiled with pork bones first until it gave off a white tint with vegetables being added later on as to keep it fresh. Can easily feed 4 people, so bring friends. This dish goes well with any other dishes here.  2nd Dish : Satay beef with vermicelli hot pot  Standard dish, with nice presentation in an actual ceramic pot. There is ample vermicelli but just a little lacking in beef. Taste wise, the satay sauce really works with the meat, but be warned you will get thirsty afterwards.   Portion size was generally good for both dishes.   Staff/Service Rating - 3.5 / 5 Given the low crowd level, service staff were able to seat us quickly and provide adequate attention when customers request refills/order/check.   Staff did not seem enthusiastic but we're fine in meeting the needs of customer.   Environment Rating - 3 / 5 Service areas for customers are kept mostly clean. Floors could use some mopping but tables are clean when customers sit down. Rear sanitary facilities could use some work and washrooms look like they could use some maintenance. Poor lighting in washrooms also detract from their environment score.   Price Rating - 3 / 5 Price after tax and 12% tip - $40.34. Fair pricing given soup portion size. However, the satay beef and vermicelli bowl could have been a little cheaper.   Other notes - we saw other people get an additional soup and dessert which appeared complimentary, but we never got it #Sadface. So not sure if it's based on what meals you order."}
{"text":"I love this place for consistent Cantonese food, done fast, done deliciously and for great value. The family is always hitting up this location because it never fails. It's packed at peak hours with tons of Chinese folks. The ultimate seal of approval.   Noodle soups, rice, congee, all the usual suspects are done well. Yes, the service is lacking for typical Cauasian standards, but that's because they are busy and you need to eat and get out. Time is money and they know people are busting down the door.   Another example of the solid GTA Chinese food scene."}
{"text":"They ran out of lobster that was advertised. Also - how the f does a Chinese restaurant run out of congee?! Wtf? Get the f out! They also ran out of red bean. Seriously?!   They seriously kept coming back saying they didn't have anything. Seriously bad. -5 stars   Don't even come here."}
{"text":"Excellent Cantonese food at very affordable price. The interior was cosy and not too noisy when I went there, my parents had a good time and enjoyed the food. What can I say, this place is the best of Hong Kong diner style dining in Toronto."}
{"text":"Cockroach in my congee. Mediocre service. Mediocre Chinese food. There are plenty of other places around, surely they are cleaner. If you walk outside of the restaurant, sometimes they keep their side kitchen door open and you can see all the dirty bins and the meats hanging in open air on top of them. Gross.  Gave this restaurant enough chances; will not be returning."}
{"text":"They were very generous with their seafood for the seafood congee. The ?? and the eggplant were very nicely done as well. The sweet and sour tilapia was the most upsetting dish out of the eight dishes we had ordered. Overall, it's a \"yes\" from me."}
{"text":"Surprising for a Chinese restaurant, there is great customer service. However, the dishes do not come close to beating Congee Wong's for the quality and price.   Came with my family on a weekend and we were immediately seated by the friendly staff. I'd like to note that they were all very attentive and engaging, which was not the usual for Chinese restaurants but hey, I'm not complaining.   We ordered several dishes, from the large soup to the fried noodles, fried rice with eel, and beef tendon.  All the dishes were good, standard Chinese dishes. I would say the portions are much smaller than that of Congee Wong's and slightly more expensive. The taste was a bit more bland, not as flavorful as I would of hoped.   The service is something to note, it's actually really good here! However, I will probably just head do Congee Wong when my next craving for Chinese food hits me based on the quality, portions, and price.   If you are to stop by, I highly recommend any of the fried noodle dishes - that was one I thought they did really well and the portions were on par."}
{"text":"My grandfather goes to Keung's occasionally and he suggested we go here for lunch. I figured why not, it was a short drive for him because he lives close by and he likes the food.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, it is really difficult to get into the plaza off Silver Star - and parking is really hard to find. There are a bunch of shops in this tiny plaza, so everyone is trying to either get into the plaza or out. Be careful!  Going into the restaurant, I was greeted with a friendly welcome and was seated. Ordered a Cantonese Chow Mein with some sweet and sour spare ribs, a coffee for myself and a Hong Kong style milk tea for my grandfather.  The chow mein portion was huge, had lots of meat and shrimp. The sweet and sour spare ribs also tasted really good. It wasn't insanely expensive and the waiter was very friendly.  The only negative comment I have about this place is they \"ran out of soy milk,\" never has this happened in a Chinese restaurant to me. But hey, there's a first time for everything.  4/5."}
{"text":"Before my visit to Keung Kee, I did not have high expectations. My parents have told me that this restaurant was great but I was still skeptical of the quality of food. I decided to give it a try with my friends. Arriving at the restaurant, we were seated and the waitress quickly took our order (see photos of food). The food arrived one after another at a decent time. The sweet and sour pork was good but did not 'wow' me. The vegetables did not have much flavor but maintained a good 'wok hei'. The white cut chicken was decent and the meat tasted well with the rice and green onion. The tofu and fish in steaming pot did not have flavor and disappointed me. Overall, the food was below average. The décor was nice and added a nice ambience when eating. I give this restaurant 3 stars. I recommend this restaurant to people that do not know what to eat for dinner."}
{"text":"This is pretty much a neighborhood institution by this point. It's been around for as long as I've lived in this area..... which is pretty much all my life. A large menu of Cantonese food that is traditional, made with quality ingredients and has some hidden gems.   The chicken with rice in a pot is the usual go-to choice. The rice is actually fried rice so there are cubes of taro sprinkled throughout which is nice. Pro tip, if you let the rice sit in the bowl a little longer, it will form a slight crust that you can scrap off the sides of the pot. It gives an extra textural element, and makes it even better. The chicken is even good on it's own, not the tofu soft mushy meat that you usually encounter.  We've been coming here more in the recent months since they are open late and provides all the comfort food needs. Came here recently for a late dinner and there was plenty of busy tables happily tucking into dishes. I watched the table across from us get a large hot-pot bowl mounded full of veggies and chunks of meat. Some at the table even proceeded to suck the marrow out of the bones with a straw. Don't know what it was, but will look for it next time."}
{"text":"We came for a regular dinner.  We ordered a Clam in Spicy Wine ($12) and a Pork Chops in Sweet and Sour Sauce ($10).  The clam entree was indeed really spicy.  The portion was generous.  The flavour of pork chop entree was average.  The portion was impressive for the price, though.  The pork chops were soft and juicy.  Both dishes went well with white rice.    The services was friendly.  The decor was contemporary, airy and pleasant.  While one of our orders costed only $10, most dinner entrees cost over $12, including vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"Come to think of it I haven't been to this Keung Kee location in a very long time, since I live closer to the one at Steeles/Warden T&T plaza, and let's just say it was not worth the extra commute. I'd give the other location 3.5 stars but only 2 here before the food wasn't as good in comparison.  Environment: There are 3 big plazas at the Finch/Midland intersection, and Keung Kee is located at the 3rd plaza north of the intersection. The parking space is rather tight but there are a few extra spaces at the back of the plaza if you don't mind walking a little bit more.  The restaurant is pretty big with many large round tables in the middle, that can fit groups of 6-10. The decor are really pretty as well and the space was bright and clean. I was here for weekday dinner and the restaurant was quite empty, with only customers sitting on the smaller tables at the edges.   Food: We ordered BBQ Pork, Pork Belly with Taro in Casserole, Minced Pork with Noodles, and Pork Bone Congee.  The BBQ Pork is always my go-to dish at this restaurant because the flavour is amazing and the meat is very soft. It did not disappoint.  The Pork Belly with Taro was also a great dish as well, if you don't mind eating some fat. Personally, I think the fat is absolutely the best part of the dish because it just melts in your mouth and it didn't feel greasy at all.  Minced Pork with Noodles was pretty average and the portion was smaller than I expected. Not a great dish to get from their noodles section. The Pork Bone Congee had great flavour, but it's not something that I would have liked in a congee dish. The congee had a really strong black pepper taste which I thought was too over-powering, as congee dishes tend to be pretty light in terms of flavour. Also, given that the restaurant's full Chinese name ???? includes the word \"congee\" in it, I was expecting a lot more from this dish.  For dessert, we each received a small bowl of sweet tofu. The tofu was very soft and I liked the slight ginger taste in the syrup.   Service: Non-existent service. Had to call them many times to get our request across. Even though the restaurant was only like half full they still seemed to be understaffed, so the waiters were always busy and on the go.   The bill ended up being $45 after tax for the 3 of us, which wasn't really that bad come to think of it. However, the food just wasn't spectacular at all, and I would much rather visit the other Keung Kee location."}
{"text":"I went to both locations( midland/finch, Kennedy/hwy7) a few times last month... My experience were very good, great food and friendly staffs, and the price was very reasonable.... And most important thing, both places were very clean every time when I visit.... I hate going into restaurant that is dirty and poor service!! Anyway, I will recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles visiting the Toronto area.  The surrounding area has lots of competition (which brings more choices for the customers).  Most of the other places are starting to close down since we came pretty late in the evening.   The food here is delicious and it is reasonably priced (per current US exchange rates which is $1 to $1.31).  The milk tea is good since the tea maintained its temperature as i took my last sip from the cup minutes later.  The portion size is decent sized and is authentic HK style food.    Will definitely come again next time i visit this area."}
{"text":"The quality of food in this location is not as good as the one in Unionville. Based on this experience, I will go back to the one in Unionville to eat."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5  This review only focuses on the afternoon tea portion of the menu.  Afternoon tea runs from 3pm to 530pm everyday.  Prices are cheaper for certain dishes and they all come with a drink for free.  Pros: Big portions  Great prices Free drink, even cold one  Cons: Service gets slow when busy  If you're familiar with Hong Kong style restaurants, they all have an afternoon tea promotion.  Basically in the mid afternoon, usually after 3pm to about 5-6 pm, they have a couple of dishes priced a little cheaper than normal and they offer a free drink as well.    I love coming here for afternoon tea.  They have a lot things to choose from, much more than most other places.  The prices are great too.  The free drink is nice.  I always get a cold HK milk tea.  Usually, you're charged extra for a cold drink.  This is standard practice actually but Keung Kee does it for free!  Another bonus!!  YAY!!  I loved the baked rice dishes. You choose a sauce,  and a choice of protien (pork, chicken, fish etc.)  The portions are big so you always leave full.   So if you ever wake up too late on a weekend and you feel like something that can last you to dinner, think about giving Keung Kee a try.  This is my go to place on Saturdays when I sleep in.  The service can get slow when they're busy, which they can get on weekends, but nothing that will disappoint you."}
{"text":"This is the go-to restaurant for Chinese Cantonese food. This location has being here for what must be almost two decades now. The pork bone soup loaded with carrots, radishes and tofu puffs is a must order everytime we come here. It's very filling! Love all the non-greasy non-spicy food here, whereas most other Chinese restaurants within the area specialize in greasy spicy food!   The clam congee is also the one dish we order each time we come here. The clams are really fresh, and it just warms your stomach on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"This is my fav congee place, place is comfort and clean, deco is morden, service is fast and friendly, menu is clear, food is yummy Their chicken congee is the must-try item I have been here more than 15 times and everytime I order SMT new- they never disappoint me! Tips: ask them for recommendation and they will give u wonderful advice"}
{"text":"I always come here for a late night run. This restaurant is usually open until 2AM. It has fantastic food for a good deal. The restaurant is very clean and there's usually room for parties of any size.   The menu has a lot of options to choose from so if you're craving southern Asian food, this is a good spot. I usually get a rice, the pepper salt tofu, and a meat dish. The consistency is on point, and the portions or reasonable.  The deep fried tofu dish is fantastic. Its a great dish and there's plenty to go around!"}
{"text":"Keung's Delight's Midland location is not as nice as the one at Steeles and Warden, even though the décor is quite similar.    Now onto the food!  I didn't enjoy this particular dough fritters rice noodle roll, which is something I usually love. The rice noodle was too sticky and the dough fritters were not crispy enough. All the pieces just ended up stuck together.   Thankfully, fried turnip patties with XO sauce redeemed the meal. Although I would've preferred a drier texture to the overall dish, the flavours were really delicious with the XO sauce. However, I still prefer Congee Wong's execution of fried turnip patties.   Belacan fried chicken wings were very crispy, but I couldn't really taste the Belacan in the seasoning. Nevertheless, I enjoyed these wings, despite their greasiness.    Deep fried crispy milk blocks were very yummy but rather heavy. After eating three pieces, I felt really stuffed. Not a very light end to the meal. Next time, I'll need to save more stomach space to conquer these delectable milk blocks!"}
{"text":"Authentic is what i would call this restaurant.  Why?  Because the dishes are true chinese style food.  For example my friends ordered pork bone soup, and literally a huge pot of soup came with lots of pork bones and veggies.  We also ordered steamed tofu from the province of Fujian in China that came with minced meat toppings.  Last but not least,  i ate chicken knuckles.  Yup.  It was chewy... and crunchy.  Lol.    We were there after 9pm, and as the night wore on, more people came in for late night bites.  It was bustling.  The wait staff did a good job attending to us with all our requests.  And the food arrived pretty fast.  It's also a good thing that the food was fresh and hot.   Can't wait to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"A great place to go for the afternoon tea special, which starts at 3pm. Order anything from the special menu and get a choice of any drink for free. Not just limited to tea and coffee, can order the fancy crushed ice drinks with ice cream at no extra charge.  Typical Hong Kong diner style food, backed rice and spaghetti, large selection of food on both the regular menu and the afternoon tea menu. Been here a few times for dinner and afternoon tea, the portions are decent. The consistently of the food ordered each time is practically the same. The taste of the food is always good and never disappoints. The rice noodle roll comes out steaming hot and is covered with sauces, served with wood skewers. It's soft and smooth but have to eat it while it's hot. The fried meats were on point for both dishes, crispy and well seasoned.  Family style restaurant suitable for small or large groups. The service was mediocre but no complaints as it was expected.  Overall, really enjoy the afternoon tea special and definitely a place to keep coming back to."}
