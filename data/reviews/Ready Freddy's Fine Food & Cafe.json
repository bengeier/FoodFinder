{"text":"Admittedly, I've only been here for coffee and baked goods, but I'm a big fan. The coffee is great, the baked goods are fantastic (and there are great gluten-free/vegan options) and the staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The price is reasonable and the atmosphere is very relaxing and inviting. I'm looking forward to going back and trying the lunch options."}
{"text":"Recently opened Cafe. The coffee there is so good and the food is very tasty! I'm really happy that I discovered it. Definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I happened to drop by on my way to the subway this week and was very impressed! I spoke to the owner (Shaun?) and he explained that all of their food and baked goods are made from scratch, which is a rarity these days.   As I was in a hurry, I picked up a blueberry muffin and an English breakfast tea. The muffin was still warm by the time I for to the office and was absolutely delicious! The tea was piping hot, just the way I like it.   I noticed they also have a lunch and dinner menu here and I can't wait to drop by again soon to try it, especially since the prices are so reasonable.  It's a bit out of the way unless you live or work in the area, but don't let that put you off, it's definitely worth the effort!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and relaxed cafe for brunch, lunch or just coffee! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great service and great vibe. Nice place to get some work done as well. Steps away from both Rosedale and Bloor stations."}
{"text":"All day breakfast, you cant go wrong with that.  Need a solid meal during breakfast grab a fried egg sandwich, comes with two eggs, bacon and this herb mayo that is so good.  Only wish is that they didn't cook the egg over easy, when i asked for a more runny egg but that's my only real complaint."}
{"text":"Passed by 2 days ago and got attracted by illy Italian coffee placed at the window. We ordered steak rap which was not on the menu yet, and the chicken fingers. I love how they use actual chunks of steak instead of thin slices - it really adds to the dish. The chicken fingers are moist and crunchy and the sweetpotato fries are just as good as the chicken fingers.   The service is pretty good and for a downtown deli this place has great deals!"}
{"text":"A great little place for coffee and food. Their daily selections of muffins and pastries are fresh and yummy. The owner and staff are very pleasant too! I come home almost every day to grab a coffee or a quick bite to eat while I'm at work. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a convenient place to eat with good food and service. All the while supporting a local business."}
