{"text":"Our server Kummis was excellent, kind, helpful and very knowledgeable.  The food is really good, nice portions and the price very affordable for vegetarian Indian food. I didn't missed the meat! Best part of the menu is natural juices.   It is worth trying this place you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I am giving this review for the food I had. I had a very bad experience with their Paratha's. I ordered Paneer and Potato parantha and it was dough layer with plain paneer in it. No taste at all. I found it bit expensive as it costs $12 for 1 paratha. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"I ordered cholle bhature and it was very bad experience. The bhaturas were very oily and they were not even properly puffed up. I told the waiter that i needed it to be fully puffed before order but either it was my bad day or their food is like that. When confronted the waiter, he brought a new one which was also similar to the first two and then I came to know that they haven't seen how a fully puffed bhatura looks like. Ambience is good but the food is not."}
{"text":"I always go to the advance blvd location n love the food n staff. When this location opened nearby I was very happy and went with same faith here not once but twice, the food tastes different n the staff is rude. I understand this is a dine in but I have somebody on wheelchair ao we prefer take out during this season. The staff treats you like they are doing a favor to me by taking my order. Unacceptable! Would never be visiting here again. Rather visit advance blvd location is what I would recommend"}
{"text":"Visited following bridal lengha shopping in the area with my mom and soon to be mother in law.  We ordered dokhla and tandoori mushrooms appetizers to start. Both were super tasty dishes and loaded with lots of flavour.  For my main, I chose the veggie thali, my mom went with the channa curry, and my mother in law selected their dosa. Everything was really tasty, carefully plated, and truly hit the spot. Nice level of spice in every dish but not too over the top.  At the end of our meal, our waitress brought us all small pieces of complimentary jalebi candy to enjoy. What a sweet touch!  Our waitress was super nice but since she seemed to be the only person serviing the restaurant, it did take a while to get our bill at the end.  Will be back to visit again someday soon!"}
