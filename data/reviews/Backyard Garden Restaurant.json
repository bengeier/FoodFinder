{"text":"Popping my review cherry here! I'd recommend this restaurant if:
1. You love spicy food
2. You can withstand spicy food

Definitely recommend their spicy chicken, the water cooked fish, and any of their signature noodles.

Tip: order takeout on their website and use promo code 'EXPANCIO108' to receive 5% off."}
{"text":"Great authentic restaurant for szechuan food. The dishes are pretty good, spicy and flavorful. We tried some new dishes and some old favorites, I would suggest just sticking with what you know. The service was good. Their smoothies are very fresh, a must-try!"}
{"text":"Every dish we ordered was absolutely delicious. Much better then the Chinese restaurant we originally had in mind; luckily they were closed so we got a chance to try this splendid place. The Szechuan Dan Dan noodles and Wonton chilli soup are some of the best I've ever had, but just a tad too salty. We tried the smoked duck and various types of dumplings quite good indeed! 
*Most of the restaurants in this area do not accept credit cards, however here they do if you spend over $35, (or 25 maybe, don't remember exactly how much)."}
{"text":"reasonably priced. lots of msg. lots of grease. some dishes are just not well cooked. for example, the longkou vermicelli in the spicy boiling fish fillet is so overcooked that it totally falls apart"}
{"text":"Very nice!

The Korean food is so delicious that I cannot to stop my chop stickers. Anything else, there is one waiter I still remember who speak Chinese as well as a Chinese native speaker even though he is a Korean for sure.

The cold noddles is a little spicy for me, and some beef is hard to chewing. However, the atmosphere in this restaurant is quite enough and you even don't need to be worried about having a launch in a noisy place.

Good place, if I had a chance, I would introduce it to my family."}
{"text":"Like chinese food? Love spicy food? Must try Backyard Garden.  The food is simply tasty. Lot of flavour. They use alot of peppercorns in their dishes. I Love their eggplants and pineapple fish.  

The restaurant is simple and unassuming. Waiters don't speak english very well but enough to get by.

It's worth the drive to Markham from Downtown."}
{"text":"This eatery was one of our group favourite when it came to Chinese food and price for lunch just next door to our office.  Today, there were three (3) of us ordered three (3) separate dishes with free soup.  The bill came up to $21.90.  Each of us footed $10.00 with a 10 dollar bill and a 20 dollar bill.  The change came back with $5.00 short.  We advised the waitress we paid $30.00, and it was a 10 dollar bill and a 20 dollar bill.  The waitress outrightly denied and insisted she collected only $25.00 comprised of a 5 dollar bill and a 20 dollar bill.  Both waitresses were ganging up and appeared angrily rude.  We stood at the cashier counter until they relented and returned the $5.00.  Despite the unpleasant incident, we tipped them $3.00.

B E W A R E what they return for your change.  This is a bad experience having to deal with deceitful people after a hearty meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food. One of my favourite restaurants in all of the GTA.

The popular Shuizhu yu (fish) is amazing, as is the beef version of the dish. 

Their special noodles (can't remember what it's called, but it's one of the first items on the menu) is absolutely incredible. They're transparent in colour.

Other note-worthy mentions: eggplant and sizzling beef. 

The price is also amazing. And by amazing, I mean cheap."}
{"text":"My dad took a wrong turn off the highway and we wound up here. We had the shredded chicken cold noodle, black vinegar sugar braised deep fried fish fillets, green onion pancake, tiny pea shoots and cumin lamb, and ended the meal with the pan fried red bean pancake dessert. Big portions, good prices, very authentic numbing spice with savoury flavours. Also not too salty! 10/10 would return again."}
{"text":"My family used to come here quite a bit. Maybe we've been visiting recently on off days, but the quality of the food, from my experience, has deteriorated.
If I wrote this review based on my first few experiences at this restaurant, I would give it 4 stars... but I haven't been too impressed during my last few visits. 
 I love spicy food, so I personally would say that the food isn't too spicy, but I can't speak for everyone else-- A good portion of the dish is actually just chilli peppers-- which, even for spicy food lovers like me, means that the amount of food you can actually eat is less than it appears. I won't complain about that though, as the food in this restaurant is still extremely cheap. My family of 5 usually spends around $40-$60 here, with food left to take home. 
There aren't really that many vegetarian options, although the eggplant and vegetarian's delight usually tastes pretty  good (except during my last visits, when it was barely decent). 
Nonetheless, the food is usually quite flavourful (like I said, during the past few visits, the flavour hasn't been as good), and is really authentic Szechuan cuisine. I like the spicy beef appetizer, eggplant, the crispy chilli chicken dish (forgot the real English name, but it's crispy!) and Dan Dan noodles.
The food is a bit too salty, though, and in most dishes a TON of oil is used so it can taste a bit greasy. They don't use MSG in their dishes though, so I guess that is a plus.
And no, the waiters do not speak English very well, but communication is definitely possible. And they are quite friendly, despite the fact that this restaurant is generally very busy.
There are three other restaurants that are part of this restaurant chain: Chilli secrets in Richmond Hill, Szechuan legend in Scarborough, and another one that I've never been too. Personally, Szechuan legend is my favourite, although I haven't been there in a while."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food. Tastes good and the price is reasonable.

The service is average.

Overall I like this restaurant."}
{"text":"As a fan of spicy food, I really enjoyed the dishes here. The staff were friendly and helpful, and everything was clean. Ordering in English was no problem. We had a wide mix of dishes, and they were consistently good.

My only complaint was that the food was very oily. The other reviews have said that this is the most authentic Szechuan restaurant in the GTA, so perhaps this is just how the cuisine is prepared, but be prepared for a lot of oil."}
{"text":"It's been ages since we've come here.  We always tend to order the same dishes because we know what we like.  Tonight, however, things were not the same as the good ol' days.  

FIrst off, prices have gone up.  Flipping through the menu, this was quite evident.  Dishes have all gone up by at least a dollar or two.  

Second, the portions have shrunk.  Everyone at our table remembers when we would have a huge fish to consume, and today, we were picking at bones and could barely find any meat.  It wasn't just the fish, it seemed like it was every single dish.  

Overall, the taste and the quality was alright.  It doesn't have that \"we HAVE to go there\" factor anymore.  

I noticed it wasn't as crazy busy as it used to be.  There would always be a crowd waiting inside and outside for a table.  Not anymore."}
{"text":"In the Chinese strip mall (Metro Square) next to IBM compound. 

One of the best, and very authentic Szechuan restaurant in GTA. There is another location of this restaurant in Scarborough which also serves ok Cantonese dim sum at lunch time. 

Pretty extensive menu. Can't go wrong with fish fillet in hot oil/soup or in pickled vegetable soup (in the soup section of the menu); they do justice to typical Szechuan dishes like beef in spicy sauce (or spicy beef stew), diced chicken with chili, lamb cooked with cumin flavour, cold appetizers like spicy beef/innards slices with chili sauce, starch noodle with red chili sauce (noodles made from green beans) 

Unlike a Cantonese restaurant, green/leafy vegetable dishes are lacking."}
{"text":"Best Chinese comfort food.  Quality of food is consistently good every time we come. Would not change a thing."}
{"text":"Food Value - Excellent
Service - Excellent 
Take out Experience - Excellent and Efficient
Overall, I highly recommend this place if you would like spicy Chinese food.
Their signature dish is 'water cook fish' and their new menu has improved with lots of choice!
enjoyable place for small group, it is a little bit smaller for large group."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what your backyard garden tastes like, but this one's a \"spicy meatball\".  Ok.. minus the meatball.

Don't let this Szechuan gem intimidate you.  The food looks much spicier than it is.  We had a few szechuan specialty dishes: spicy lamb kabobs, chili beef tongue (and yes.. it was the only tongue I got that night), and the chili chicken dish that came on a wok on top of a burner.  The longer you let it sit, the more fragrant it gets.  Now all this might sound very painful, but it really was all very flavourful without getting into the high heat threshold.  

If you're looking to sample real Szechuan, this is a great authentic place to go.  

Anyways, if it was my real backyard garden.. I'd be tasting a lot of dirt.. and weed.  Insane in the brain!"}
{"text":"There's a couple of restaurants under this chain. Here's the low-down for this place:

1) You must love everything spicy... The hot kind and the kind that numbs your soul.
2) Their clay pot dishes are magic
3) Keep track of your order because they forget (even after having repeated your order back to you)
4) They now have a bigger dim sum menu
5) They are SOOOO Spicy. Like SOOOO spicy!!! 

That is all."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch in the IBM/Warden & Steeles area.  Lunch special menu has so much variety and includes bowl of Hot and Sour Soup for under $6.

If you want authentic spicy dishes, this is the place to go at lunch time.  Eggplant hot pot, Three cup chicken, and spicy intestine hotpot.  We have gone back many times and still have not tried all the dishes on the lunch menu.  I see lots of people getting takeout or ordering extra food to go."}
{"text":"Had this with several of my co workers for dinner. Mapo tofu, crispy chilli chicken, beef wraps, chicken in chilli oil and few veggies and rice for about $15 per person.  It was delicious but very spicy; especially the beef wraps. Recommended for some good Szechuan dishes.  Some of my Chinese co workers however thought the dishes were relatively smaller versus other restaurants.  The service however is just ok; they forgot one of our dishes and they came at random times instead of all close to each other."}
{"text":"Best sichuan (spicy) chinese spot ever. Very authentic, always delicious, and has remained as my go to place in case i'm out of dinner plans. 
love: cumin lamb, picked fish soup, lobster/crab (if they're in season), chive pancakes, xi'an noodles, chilly chicken.
relatively clean for a chinese spot, always leave here with a happy belly."}
{"text":"We came in a large group (11) and it was great, no line up and we were seated right away. This is authentic szechuan food and it's delicious. 

Recommendations:
1. Salted Egg Yolk shrimp - super delicious and crispy. You can even eat the shell of the shrimp which I normally don't do.
2. Fish soup w/pickled cabbage and Vermicelli - sour, not fishy and really good! The fish was not overcooked, soft and bone free.
3. lamb skewers - well seasoned, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. This was my personal favourite. 

Things that make you go hmm.....
1. Washroom - eek
2. No English - they only speak Mandarin so make sure you go with someone who knows what they are eating and/or be prepared to point at the pictures on the menu.

Overall, good tasting food and I may go back. It's not my favourite cuisine but I do like it from time to time and I'd consider going back."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere in this restaurant. The food was cheap too. Hope the flavor can improve a bit in the future."}
{"text":"Was headed uptown for a birthday dinner and decided to pickup some Chinese food so of course I Yelp'ed the nearby places and decided to check out this place because of the strong reviews.

Placing the order was a bit of a challenge with the communication breakdown.  My attempt to order the eggplant dish resulted in describing it as \"that purple vegetable\" and eventually giving up, saying \"forget the eggplant\".  Managed to convey that we wanted the lamb kabob, the spicy boiled fish, kung pao shrimp, dan dan noodles, some kind of minced bean and beef dish (although I'm pretty sure I ordered those as two separate dishes - lol).  

Despite these challenges, the food was ready within 15 minutes.  The lady at the counter seem quite amused that a group of non Chinese would come to their place so I proceeded to show her Yelp on my smartphone and explain to her that this is what brought me here, to which she simply smiled and nodded.  Upon picking up the food, I realized the two orders of lamb kabob were literally two single kabobs, so we asked for two more, which they produced in next to no time.

Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food.  In particular, the steamed fish, the dan dan noodles and the spicy lamb kabob were hits..actually I think pretty much every dish except that inadvertently ordered minced bean/beef dish was absolutely delicious.  The food was spicy (lots of red chillies, which was to our liking) but also very salty...there was definitely a sensation of tongue numbness after eating the meal, but overall this is a small complaint and the meal definitely made us all very happy."}
{"text":"Consistent flavours and great food! I'm a regular here because it's a family favorite. My favorite are their fish dishes, I recommend steamed or sweet/sour is good too.

Their rice pot (stirfry over rice) are great value, comes with tons of meat, veggies, and rice. Overall I'd also recommend the salted duck egg sweet potatoes, lamb skewers, and beef wraps (with scallion pancakes)."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Sichuan places in Toronto. Copious amounts of spicy and numbing - get your napkins and water ready!

Classical dishes like Dan Dan noodles, cold bean noodles (is that the name? ??), string beans, spicy chicken, water-cooked fish ???, the list goes on!

Service is quick and above average mannerisms than other Chinese restaurants. Great food and worth the drive from Mississauga for me!"}
{"text":"Been going here regularly for 2yrs, we're yet to be disappointed...
Also not sure why I've waited 2yrs to write this review...!!!

My personal favourites:
1) Cold Chicken Noodles
2) Cumin Beef

Even their take-out packages are better and classier than most steakhouses...Big & Strong Styrofoam boxes with a layer of Aluminum Foil inside making sure that the hot food if melting the Styrofoam, doesn't mix with the food/soup...!!!"}
{"text":"As someone whose experience of Szechuanese food over the years was confined to the generic Chinese restaurants on Spadina between College and Dundas, I held the cuisine in fairly low esteem, associating it with sticky sauces, fried salty meat, and a tepid spice profile.

So Backyard Garden was a total revelation!  The heavy use of the Szechuanese peppercorn alone added a totally distinctive depth and dimension of flavour (the smoky, almost clove-like numbing effect that can't quite be described) and the food was legitimately, profoundly hot.  Every dish is strewn with dried chillies, which while not individually searingly hot created a sustained simmering heat that really elevated even the most familiar dishes.

I was there for Christmas Eve dinner with my family, who vetoed some of my more unconventional choices (I really wanted to try the steamed fish) in favour of the old stanbys like kung pao chicken and sizzling beef, but even these felt like a new experience.  I'm 100% certain I'll go back to explore some other corners of their menu.

I don't speak or read Chinese, but I didn't find it hard to understand and navigate the menu or to order, so this shouldn't put anyone off this exceptional culinary experience.

SIDEBAR/RANT: It's really unfortunate that downtown food has stagnated (with a few decent exceptions like King's Noodle House and Dumpling House) and that all the best Chinese restaurants are now in the outer orbits of Markham and Richmond Hill.  There has got to be a robust market for good Szechuanese food right here in the city -- I suspect it's the sky-high rents that make it cost-prohibitive for profitable restaurants at the moment, another unfortunate consequence of the surfeit of gentrification that seems to be driving low- and middle-income small business owners out of the city (for the future of which see SF, DC and NY)."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! (just no credit cards) Really like this place (2nd time here)...almost as good as flushing, ny. Liked the yu xiang pork and gong bao chicken the best."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Sichaun places that I've had, but the dishes tend to be hella oily. Overall quite flavourful, but some of the dishes lack balance (e.g. overly greasy or salty). I'm not sure if this is characteristic of Sichuan food in general. Prices are very reasonable with generous serving sizes. Service is good. And the food comes out FAST. We ordered, I went to the restroom, and upon returning, found the first dish had already arrived. The other 6-7 dishes arrived within the next 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. 

I went there expecting some authentic sichuan food. Despite how good the lamb kabobs were, the rest of the meal was a gigantic disappointment. Kou Rou is a very traditional sichuan dish and I was presented with basically what was mashed potatoes topped with some pork despite the high price. Their dishes with bamboo smelled like the cheap canned bamboo you can get from supermarkets. I have no idea why I would go a restaurant to have the chef throw cheap materials I can buy at a supermarket into a pot and bring it out. The two dishes with bamboo just reeked of preservatives.

This was one meal I regretted having. If you really want authentic sichuan food, I highly highly recommend you go to Hot Spicy Spicy instead."}
{"text":"Good homestyle Chinese food with decent portion sizes and good value price wise. Food is pretty tasty. Week nights are quiet so lots of empty tables but don't be scared off- The foods good. Weekend the place was packed at dinner time. Lots of large groups and this isn't a large restaurant so it was noisy and tight. Recommend for weeknight visits. Also they don't specialize in dumplings and Bao. Even though it's on the menu, it wasn't very good. Their sweet and sour chicken and green onion stir fry with lamb we're delicious though!"}
{"text":"Ordered several dishes and did not really liked it. Most of the items on the menu are submerged in chili oil. Food we ordered are too salty if not too bland. 

Displayed credit card accepted outside but server will tell you only accept debit or cash. Found the bowls and utensils dirty. 

Server not attentive. Tend to just leave your order at d edge of the table where there is not enough space, makes you feel uncomfortable that it might fall. There was one time he just left it on top of my husband mobile phone. 

Disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a very very long time. In fact, when it was first opened by taiwanese, it was so good that all the chains quickly sprawled up everywhere and there's even one downtown on bloor and bathurst. Alas, I don't know what the deal is anymore with regards to all these chains that could be now franchises or simply sold, but  now backyard garden seems to be run by people from china and their chef has definitely changed.  

Their service is awesome.

The staple food items like water cooked beef and fish are still there, among a couple of other spicy offal items and the price is decent. We ordered the water cooked fish, szechuan pepper chili cabbage, stir fried pork with peppers, and cold appetizer of pig stomach. They were all pretty good, but not as good as it used to be so i was a bit disappointed. Still one of the better szechuan joints in the GTA i believe."}
{"text":"I have been here many times before but this time around It was just not the same. Before it was an easy 5 star. But I was very dissppointed with the food this time around. The szechuan spice chicken was awesome but everything else was just subpar. If it was not for the chicken it would have been 2 stars.
i felt everything was dull and tasteless unlike before. Pictures will look good when I post them but thats it!!!! I have a feeling the cooked changed and the place was empty unlike before....I used to say this was the best szechuan outside of china but no more!!! Shame."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for traditional Szechuan cuisine. Everyone is very friendly. I recommend dining with someone who speaks Mandarin and knows the food well (At least for the first time). The menu is bigger than most books, and your waiter may not be as well versed in the English language as you would like. Nevertheless, the food is great! it's usually packed, so if you see something you like, point to it with awe and glee and I'm sure your waiter will get the idea. I recommend:
-  Suan Cai Yu 
-  Kung Pao chicken (May make your mouth numb)
- Cumin Lamb
- Shui Zhu Yu (Sichuan Boiled Fish)"}
