{"text":"From a walking perspective, it's a rather quaint neighborhood bistro. Nothing to tickle anyone's fancy, the store front is typical of any in a strip mall. It was near closing time and we tried our luck calling for delivery. The friendly lady graciously took down our order and the food came in about 15 minutes. The chicken souvlaki plate was well garnish with the usual, rice, fries and salad. The side fare of french fries with gravy was the top, perfectly sweeter than salty. Loved it!"}
{"text":"No. Just no.   We are fans of fried chicken and I got a flyer for this place and decided to try it out. I should really remember that you get what you pay for. 10 pieces of chicken, two boxes of fries, gravy and coleslaw for 22.00 plus taxes.  I should have just opened my trash and thrown 22$ on it.   The chicken was OVER fried in dirty oil and was dark brown/black. Some pieces were completely missing coating. Due to the lack of coating and over cooking the chicken was dry.   We called the resto back to ask how fresh this was because it just wasn't good. The girl said it was freshly made yesterday. YESTERDAY and fresh don't go together.  They get two stars though because although the girl gave a horrible answer she tried really hard to make up for it. She offered to send the driver back to pick up the chicken and bring something else but we didn't want anything else.   We went to McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"Didn't particularly enjoy it  Maybe I expected more  Nice, clean place  A definite improvement over the previous restaurants in that location  Average quality  Nothing bad  But nothing that says wow"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here before a hockey game. It is literally minutes from my home. The outside is very deceiving and the place has been flipped many times. But once inside its a different world. They really did a nice job. On this nite we went it was pasta nite. $3 a plate yes $3.....how can this be?? And these plates were big. A family infront of me ordered this and there was no way the kids would fiish these plates...They even allowed take out for the left overs???? For $3 f...ken bucks.  Anyway I ordered Pizza as I am not a pasta lover. there pizza was good. Loved the dough and the peperoni which is very important. Was a nice fix before a hockey game.I will be back."}
