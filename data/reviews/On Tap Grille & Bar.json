{"text":"Going to this On-Tap, I had the worse service at a restaurant I've had in years.  When my party arrived, the place was almost dead, a few patrons in the bar and one other table.  We were seated promptly.    We then waited so long for anyone to take drink orders, that I started timing them. After almost ten minutes someone took our drink orders; this seems excessive for a bar on a slow day.  Approximately another ten minutes passed before anyone took our lunch orders, and, when it came out, most of it was correct, but one of the burgers was badly underdone (very rare).  This is the sort of thing that attentive service could have remedied fully.  Sadly, we didn't see our server again for almost twenty minutes; by that time, there's not much to be done.  Couple this with the fact that two of us were bone dry on our drinks for much of that twenty minutes, and the overall experience was a negative one.  On the upside, the guys in the kitchen seem to know what they're doing, generally.  I recommend picking another On Tap."}
{"text":"The short review: service was not good, but not terrible. The servers were inexperienced and not fully trained on the menu and beer list. Food was as expected from a bar style place for quality and the appetizers were actually quite good (hot pepper balls and stuffed peppers).   So we came here with a decent sized group of 12 people for a dinner around 7:15PM with a reservation.  From the start, the service was less than subpar. We waited to be seated for at least 10 minutes, along with a long line of people. At our table, we waited for another 8-10 minutes for our server to take our drink order. He was not familiar with the draft list or drink menu. The appetizers we ordered, stuffed peppers and pepper balls, were actually very good. The boneless wings were not. The sauce was good, but the wings themselves were crispy - which I would expect from fried boneless and breaded wings.  Overall, I would likely recommend this place for drinks and some snacks. The draft list was long and the appetizers were good. Lots of TVs made for a good bar style atmosphere. I would not recommend this place if you are looking for good service.   Good for groups with lots of rooms and large tables.  NOTE: people in our party would have given this place 1 star because of the quality of service. I, on the other hand, understand that it may have been a single poor experience as I have only been there once. It was not bad enough that I would not try it again."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, food took forever! Burgers were plain  and lacked flavor. We got the mushroom burger and hardly had any mushrooms. The burgers looked like frozen patties. Our server took his good ole time waiting on us. We were in a corner booth and I am pretty sure he forgot about us. My family and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Other than maybe John & Mary's, in Buffalo, OnTap serves the BEST chicken wings!  Oh and it's a STEELER bar!!!"}
{"text":"The most pathetic excuse for a gyro as I have ever experienced. While I did request no onions, i could not believe there only 3 slices of lamb."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a few friends the other evening with great trepidation. Some years ago I ate at one of the other locations and came away with food poisoning, so I have been avoiding them like, well, poison. I have since learned that location was not part of the On Tap group, that it was independently owned. So, to be fair, I should try a different location.  This time I decided to try something different: the Fried Ravioli Burger. A half pound burger covered with cheese-filled ravioli, marinara sauce and Mozzarella cheese. It was listed at $9.99, and came with fries.  The fries were nothing special. Hot, but limp. The burger was also a disappointment. The ravioli was crisp but the sauce just did not pair up well with the burger (too much oregano?). It could have been me, but I love Italian food and I love a good burger, so I thought they would match up nicely. I was wrong. But still, it could just be me, so I tried to evaluate the food on its merits without my personal preferences getting in the way.  But the burger itself was also nothing special. Bland and nearly tasteless. See where I am going here? If you are charging in the $10.00 range for a burger, it better be worth $10.00. Nope. Not even close. Go down the road to BurgerFi and save some money.  When the bill came I discovered I had been given a 1/3 pound burger for $8.99. Not sure why. There is a choice of a 1/3 or a 1/2 pound burger on the menu, but not for the ravioli burger. I guess I should be happy that I had less to eat, all things considered. Anyway, the good news is I did not encounter any aftereffects."}
{"text":"the hostess looks very dirty. like she just she just rolled out of bed. hair pinned up uncombed and sloppy. no makeup or caring about her appearance. this is the first impression someone gets. next uo was our server who took her good old time to come around and even get a water. never came back to refill our water after initial fill up. never came around after meal arrived to see how things were. food was just ok. long time for food to arrive and it was slow business wise. not that many tables. took a long time for check to be printed and taken care of. never going back there."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner the other night and the food was amazing. I love the remodel as well. I was very displeased though when I left because we all ordered drinks and there was literally no alcohol in them. 4 different people. 4 different drinks. Not one of us could taste a hint of alcohol in our drinks. I'm not one to complain, I worked at a restaurant but when a customer complains you should at least TRY to fix it. Our server did NOTHING except suggest we order more. Very poor customer service if you ask me."}
{"text":"I used to love On Tap, but it seems like they have been going down hill the past few years. I don't know what happened. They are not as clean as they used to be and the quality of food isn't as good. I went here yesterday with my great aunt, and I ordered a gyro with a side of fries. There were no complaints about the gyro, and I really do like their fries (think fair-style, thick cut fries). But the quality of food has decreased drastically in the past few years. I am rooting for them to turn it around. Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"I've been going to wing night here for over 10 years. The wait staff is great and the wings are hearty and delicious. They have nightly specials and a variety of tasty foods on the menu. There are several TVs and a gigantic projector screen in the dining area, it is a great place to watch the game.  Friendly staff, great food, a view of the game and game day beer specials make for a great time. Check it out."}
{"text":"Love the new look! Extensive menu if you're looking for good bar food. Friendly service and affordable prices. Great neighborhood restaurant/sports bar."}
{"text":"Remodeled look is great it also seems more pride is displayed in staff and service muck better and food quality as well as presentation have taken a step in the right direction. Good job"}
{"text":"Ug. Nothing special.  Hosted looks like she hasn't showered.  Server was unkempt looking and talked like Ben Stein...monotone. food was typical greasy bar food.  Chicken tenders were actual chicken which was nice not like ground up like McDonald's nuggets.  Server never came back after food was brought for refills or just to see how things were.  Check took forever to bring.  Place was dead too. And 1.99 to sub coleslaw for a side salad seemed steep. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to the Falls in January and have now been here 4 times. Every time is very consistent. Wings, Chicken sandwiches and burgers are very good. They have an awesome wing buffet on Monday's. Every server, bartender and hostess we have dealt with are very nice and friendly. Tons of TV's for all sports fans to watch. On Tap is definitely a must stop and also good for families."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch recently.  I used to come to this On Tap regularly.  I have to agree with other reviewers that remarked about the bad smell and shoddiness of the restaurant.  Everything felt \"sticky\" - the booth seats, the table, the menu, the floors.  Service here has never been stellar and this visit was no exception.  I had to flag down my waiter for my check even though the restaurant was virtually empty.    The menu here has changed, and not for the good.  Many sandwiches and hamburgers have been removed from the menu (the Nightmare being one of my favorites).  The wine list features 3 or 4 red wines and a slew of white wines.  A glass of substandard merlot will cost you $6.00.  The chicken wings are dry, bony, and are served with little sauce.  The french fries here are fresh cut (or carnival fries).  I prefer crispy, well-done fries so I usually bombard these with malt vinegar.  The celery and bleu cheese were good.  Overall this is a sad representation of what this restaurant used to be in its hey day.  Prices are overblown, service is slow, and the cleanliness of the restaurant is lacking."}
{"text":"Slow service... and bland food with sparks of quirky fun.  Our waitress seemed distracted and disorganized... there was 1 other family in the front room, a couple parties in the \"lounge\" and a few in the back / side room... and a pile of wait staff scrambling around... they didn't seem stressed and sure weren't hustling... just lots of random darting about.  We started with the Broccoli Groovers and they were a really funky twist on tempura that had nothing to do with tempura.... imagine a decent sized shrub (but not too large) of broccoli dipped in cheese wiz so that the cheese soaks into the whole top... then dipped in a sturdy breading... not really heavy... not thick at all... but held in the steam so that the broccoli were very well done... and SCALDING hot... even though they were cool to the touch.  They came with plain sour cream... which was odd... but the sour cream saved the brown sugar dipping goop that came with my sweet potato fries... no really... it was goop... it had so much corn syrup in it that when I tried to dip my finger in to have a taste... nothing stuck... it was like dipping sticks in brown Nickelodian slime... but mixed with the unused sour cream... it worked.  Hubby had the 1/3 lb bacon cheddar burger and really loved it... the size was just right and the veggies were all super fresh... his regular fries were mostly an inch long and limp... no salt... no seasoning... but he loved the burger and killed the poor fries with ketchup anyway.  My Scotty Burger was pretty terrible... the burger itself was nice... good char... not too compressed... good flavor... but the horrid BBQ sauce was vinegar and booze with so much acid that the bacon even tasted pickled... once I scraped off the bacon, sauce and onion straws I was able to mostly finished... but I sure wouldn't get this again.  There are all sorts of sandwiches and salads on the menu... we may be back if we have tons of time to kill... and there are TV's so at least there is something to watch while killing time.  Not a favorite... but I will be rethinking my brocolli options for sports snacks at home now!"}
{"text":"It's not terrible, but it's not awesome.  It's one of those greasy joints that has very large beers.  The wings were a$1 a piece, which I thought was too much.  They weren't bad, but nothing special.  The Italian panini I ordered was ok too, but the sourdough bread didn't taste like sourdough at all.  I think it was just plain white Italian loaf. The sweet potato fries were awesome, but the cinnamon dip goo was horrible.  It reminded me of Nickelodeon gak.  Imagine dipping a fry into the sauce, pulling the fry back out, seeing the stuff stick to the end of the fry like a large bit of snot, and then pulling back into the sauce container without anything remaining on the fry.  It was really weird.  It didn't taste good either.  But... the beers were huge.  Service was fine--no complaints there."}
{"text":"Please, for the love of all that is holy, wipe down the menus!!!! Everyone at my table had a sticky menu. GROSS! And the salt and pepper shakers were sticky too. Ick!  The beer is good and they have lots of specials on craft beer.  I ordered wings. They weren't the best wings I've ever had but they were ok. The main problem with them was that the skin wasn't crispy and they were warm, not hot like you'd expect straight out of the fryer. So I'm wondering how long they sat before they were delivered to me. The fries were perfect though!"}
{"text":"What happened to On Tap? This used to be the best place. It doesn't create a good impression when the menus are dirty & sticky.  Our first clue should have been the empty parking lot at 5:30 on a Saturday. The waitress was polite, though. The food is mediocre, burger style food. They do have a good beer selection. The place is now dirty, dingy, & empty. Very sad."}
{"text":"We used to regularly frequent On Tap & always had a good experience. It had been awhile & even after reading some current bad reviews, we decided to go there. My first clue should have been the almost empty parking lot at 6PM on Fri. I ordered the ribs, Mac & cheese & coleslaw. The Mac & cheese tasted out of a box, the coleslaw was warm and hardly had any dressing. The only way to describe the ribs is horrible. Fatty, lots of grizzle & bone and hardly any edible meat. I have never spent $30 on such a disappointing meal, most of which I could not even eat. I will never go back there, which is a shame because it used to be one of our favorites. Even the popcorn was burnt. The only good thing I can say is about our waitress. She was very good & not being one to complain, I didn't want to put it on her because she made a good impression. Too made the food left a bad impression."}
{"text":"Have had good & bad experiences here with my expectations of the food and service. Basic bar food, nothing homemade or special that I know of.  Don't get me wrong, it fits the bill for many occasions & can hold large groups. Guess I prefer more quaint places known for something."}
{"text":"Two sided sword.  First time I went I enjoyed the food and experience, but that was spring time and we sat outside.  Tonight we decided to return, only to find about a 3\" lip at every door, just enough to make wheelchair access impossible.  Sad since we were going to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"The food here is not good. My wife got sick last year after eating here.  I came for a small party.    I can't complain about the wrap I ordered, although it's hard to mess up a buffalo wrap.  But my \"steamed vegetables\" were inedible, clearly not steamed anytime recently.  Another diner at our table was served a side of sour cream that had curdled.    Beer was fine, but their Happy Hour price is $4.00 for a pint, which isn't a very good price for happy hour.  I did like that they gave our party a separate room.  They have a number of rooms of different sizes here.  And they used to be a good restaurant so I hope they make a comeback."}
{"text":"I only spent about 15 minutes here, but they did everything right.  The host was very friendly on both the greeting and the goodbye.  The place looked clean.  I ordered a yeungling Draft (only 2.75) because I can't get it in Michigan and had a shot of Jack fire.  Bartender was nice.  Did not eat food let alone even look at a menu.  So take my limited review with a grain of salt.  Only reason not 5 stars... 5.25 for the jack was a touch high.  Had a solid looking patio and a decent amount of Draft beers."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid. Always great service and food. They remodeled it it's really nice now."}
{"text":"This location sure had a nice facelift!  The interior is completely redone, and they updated their serving plates/dishes which was a nice touch. It's very clean and updated, unlike how it was before. Our salad was fresh and our wings were delicious. I used to not be a fan of going here because of the ambiance and the food, but things have changed for the better. Great place to go for a cold beer (plenty on tap) and great wings and gourmet salads."}
{"text":"In town wanted to have a beer and dinner was driving around looking for something interesting. Although not that interesting the parking lot was packed so in I pull.   Sat at bar, from talking to a couple locals I guess the place was redone a couple years ago..nice atmosphere and crowd, although I could do without the granite bar top.   I got the stuffed Hungarian peppers which rocked. Stuffed with sausage and cheese I think topped with tomato sauce and cheese., nice spice to them unique and very good  Had Island salad with shrimp fresh salad shrimp was good and not plentiful but enough.   I'll be back when in town"}
{"text":"On Tap did the job when we were in the neighborhood and needed a snack and a beer. I had the sweet potato fries (enough for a small village), which only lacked seasoning, and my husband had the Creeper wings. Those were nicely seasoned and had a good amount of heat. The crowd was varied and ranged from retirees killing time at the bar to a pack of frat boys extolling the virtues of chewing tobacco. In short, good bar food, enthusiastic service, and free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Been going to this on tap for years for an affordable quick bite and have seen the food on the decline as well the portions for some time now. Used to have good not great burgers (for best burger Louies is still on top) but recently I've noticed the burgers are perfectly round which leads me to believe they are not formed by hand and could possibly be frozen. The bums are more often than not stale or soggy it's very strange. The gyro became my go to but for 8.99 anywhere else would get you more meat than you could handle, here it's pre portioned, so scarce I always get double meat which puts a gyro and fries over 10$ and I've finally decided it's just not worth it. Now for the good part. Their onion rings are the best I've ever had, large onions less breading. And for my secret, ask for the gyro sauce for dipping. Their gyro sauce is better than any I've ever had and I've had lots. My new go to is to call ahead for an order of orings w 2 sides of G sauce 5.99$ 7-8 large rings, take that to go, then get a double meat gyro from euro gyro for 5.99 minus lettuce. It's not great either but better than on taps w more meat for half the price. The reuben and patty melt while ok will leave even the smallest of eaters hungry after eating all of it. Another prob I have is you have to ask the server how to get a side salad bC the menu only gives you a house salad option for 5.49, which is far too expensive unless that's your meal in which you will be terribly disappointed it's the size of a normal side salad however there is a way to substute a side salad for fries but then you have to buy the fries or rings but will be cheaper than adding on a house salad for 5.49$."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day of hiking just wanting to grab food. I agree with all of the posts below but wanted to add the biggest kicker for me: they use styrofoam plates for appetizers and meals. That is a restaurant no-no to me. If I wanted to eat off that; I would stay home. Besides that, slower service, and overall first impression: one star. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"It was kind of a mess as soon as we stepped in. We wait to be seated as the sign up front indicated, and waited, and waited. Finally we're spotted and sat by one of the many staff members that looked like they literally just rolled out of bed. The table next to us spent the duration of our meal filthy and un-bussed. Our server was so dull and slow I would swear to God she was barred tf out on Xanax, sniffling wetly as she took our order. And I thought maybe service was so slow because it was busy? But all the staff members just sort of... drifted around the floor in their dirty bed t-shirts. Food wasn't great, tasted bland and weird, except for the sweet potato fries that I ordered.   One thing I really liked was that entrées came out AS SOON as we were done with our appetizer. Dig it.  Also the one server full on rubbed her nose up and down with her palm in the middle of the floor. Okay, I want you to think about this: If the dining room is this gross and dirty, what do you think the kitchen looks like? Maybe the cooks are all wearing nasty pajamas, who knows. A girl can dream."}
{"text":"This is a pretty casual place but the food was really good. I had chili and 1/2 sandwich combo.  The chili was legit- homemade, thick and spicy. My daughter got a gyro with house made tzatziki sauce which was delicious. My husband got the turkey club- again- and loved it. They have several locations and although the ambiance is different at each, the food is consistently very good."}
{"text":"The place was just redone and looks great. I had a beautiful waitress serve me Mahi Mahi with sweet potatoes on top. It was crazy and I loved it."}
{"text":"New atmosphere is inviting. The groovers always keep me coming back and the wings. But totally dig the renovation. Everything is pretty good on the menu. I will be a forever customer"}
