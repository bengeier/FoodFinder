{"text":"Where should I start, I am not one to blow smoke and don't often give online reviews but given that I'm an at home chef and a licensed food critic (in my head) I had to give props where deserved. My family and I have bumped into this truck on 2 different occasions around the Queen City and lucky us!!! Kickin Kitchen has the best chicken wings I have ever experienced from a food truck! Trust me when I say... order some of the Razzle Dazzle flavor to eat there AND get an order to take home because you will be craving that flavor all darn day!! Also, if you are in the mood for America's favorites (Burgers, Hotdogs and Fries) you won't be disappointed in the least but I implore you to KICK up your experience and order the upgraded versions. Did I mention they also have Tuscan Fish Tacos?!...the flavor is so on point!! Basically, give them a try you will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Cant begin to explain how upset I was when this Food Truck stood me up at an event I booked with them a month in advance for 100 people. I called them the morning of the event because it was 30 minutes after the time they were supposed to be there, was told I didn't send a confirmation email. So I proved I did and proved he had responded back in email with confirmation he would be there and then he sent a menu and then called me shortly after to go over the menu. Then said he would try to get a truck out to us. When I didn't receive a call back and people started asking about vending machines ect. I got upset and called back for him to give another bogus explanation how he thought he called and let people know he had a food truck down ect. Regardless his story kept changing and people starting leaving early due to be hungry, because we did advertise a food truck for our event. He didn't care or show any remorse , I will never recommend this place to anyone. This was so disappointing . VERY Unreliable and Unprofessional!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come try Kickin Kitchen after seeing a new report on the business, where the reporters gave glaring reviews after eating there.  I ordered BBQ, Honey Mustard, Lemon Pepper, and Teriyaki 6 piece chicken and fries.  The fries were decent (hard to say something special about fries), and the chicken was rather tasty (per my sons and nephews). Please go by Kickin Kitchen if you are looking to eat good quality food. Beware, service is slow if you are making multiple orders at once"}
