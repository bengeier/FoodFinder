{"text":"Had a great lunch there today.  The pork belly bun is authentic Fukienese and tastes amazing.  The melt in your mouth pork belly is topped with orange day lily and cilantro - what a great contrast in textures and taste!   Another favuorite of mine is the Hai Nan chicken - it's one of the best in town.  Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"A fairly limited menu selection, but the fish noodles are excellent.  Kind of a niche place in that regard, but good when you know exactly what you're there for (and for me, that would be fish noodles).  Noise levels have gone down since the days before the owner changed, and the place isn't as crowded as it once was, which is a good thing in my book when it brings down wait times."}
{"text":"This place was LEGENDARY not only among Toronto's Chinese populations but also American Chinese who come to GTA for binge-eating weekend tours as THE place for Fukienese food.    BEFORE  The food was excellent -- **drool** over fish-noodles, in broth or stir fried; prawns with minced ginger; beef stew, lamb stew with dried bean curd, stir fried savory sticky rice, and excellent desserts (taro paste with ginko nuts).   There were many \"rules\" to follow, annoying to some but all part of the \"experience\": -- you couldn't be seated until the entire party arrives, no reservation of course -- never mind privacy, 9 out of 10 times you'd be sharing a table with another party or multiple other parties -- there is one dish that you were not allowed to take leftover home. Secret recipe? -- the lady of the restaurant wasn't exactly warm or chatty. Remember Seinfeld soup nazi?  Some of us joked that she was the Chinese female version. But she was always fair and consistent; I liked her.  -- super efficient service, that small kitchen and 2 or 3 waitresses on duty moved fast and turned tables quickly  It would have been worth at least 4.5 stars.   Fast forward, the restaurant changed hands about 2 years ago although the new owner kept the same name and pretty much the same menu.   NOW   The food is okay, definitely not as good as before for some of the dishes, but worth a visit when you have a craving for Fukienese food.   Service somewhat improved as in, you might see a smile once in a while now.   But I missed the \"old\" experience.  3 star now."}
{"text":"My previous review was based on the old management and I came back for dinner last week so time for an update!  Delicious Food Restaurant's food does taste a better this time. Maybe I came with someone that is Fukienese and I let him do the order? Or the smiling face of the owner and waitress made my dining experience a lot better?  We shared Rice Dumpling ($4.80), Oyster Pancake ($10.99) and Vegetable Wraps ($4.99).  All the dishes were served hot and were all quite tasty.   The restaurant is small. Arrive early on weekends so you won't be disappointed and avoid waiting for a table.  Closes Mondays and Tuesdays"}
