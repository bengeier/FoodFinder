{"text":"Ate there for the first time today.  Ordered a barbecue sandwich.  Tasted ok nothing special until I started chewing something odd, a piece of aluminum foil.  Showed to one of the staff and after about ten minutes got some lame excuses but no apology.  Was offered to order something else but no thank you.  And the big topper, they still CHARGED me for it.  Don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Great little joint! Everyone was friendly and treated me like I'd been going there for years. I had a cheeseburger all-the-way, fries, and a cheerwine.  I was told the burgers are hand pattied and the meat is brought in fresh and never frozen. It was really really good.  From the personable staff, to the last bite, this is a great small town restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went to Libbys Pit Stop for breakfast around 10 AM on a Saturday morning. The place was busy but not terribly so. We found a table right away and placed our drink orders. We all ordered standard short order breakfast, I ordered one scrambled egg with sausage, rice with gravy and toast. My son had two scrambled eggs, sausage, hashbrowns and toast and my husband had the same and also added a biscuit and gravy. Nothing too complicated, right? At least that`s what we thought. It took 40 minutes and a flagged down waitress to have our plates brought to our tables. My husband discovered that his food was cold and told the waitress who told him that she would take care of it. She brought the plate right back and said she had heated it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Aside from the painfully slow service the food tasted OK. We will probably give this place another chance before we write them off all together just to be sure that we didn't catch them on a bad day."}
{"text":"This is simply a great little diner - very good food at reasonable prices, and excellent, friendly service. It is not much to look at, inside or out, but don't be fooled - you came for the food anyway. There are Dale Earnhardt Sr pictures, posters, statues, and other memorabilia in display cases and on the walls, everywhere. Don't know if Dale ever ate here (know that he had a favorite diner across town), but I'd bet he'd like the food and the people.  We kept it simple - a Chopped BBQ Sandwich with slaw (not BBQ slaw), and a Chili Dog with mustard, chili, & onions. The Hot Dog was outstanding - a classic Southern style chili dog - nice meaty chili, decent wiener, fresh cut onions, soft bun - there aren't that many better than the dog here.  The Chopped sandwich was also very, very good - typical of the barbecue in the Lexington/Salisbury corridor, but with a touch more smokiness than you usually encountered outside the Lexington city limits. For my taste, this barbecue is superior to that offered at better known BBQ joints in the area, like Gary's, Porky's, and Troutman's. This is pig prepared with care and pride.  The service was excellent - friendly, and funny - like Flo and friends. We'll definitely be back."}
