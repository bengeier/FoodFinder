{"text":"Ok fajitas Sonora. A lot of grizzled meat (plenty of uneatable fat and grizzle) smothered in BBQ sauce. Too sweet. Not what I expected. Not like traditional fajitas. Waiter was not attentive and struggled to keep us with our needs. And we are low maintenance. Not sure how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to a Laredo's in quite some time and my first visit to this Laredo's location. Unfortunately, it confirmed my general feeling that the quality of the food at these restaurants has declined in recent years. 

The first impression arrived in the form of brown, overcooked tortilla chips. I ate two. Next, I was in the mood for a lighter lunch, so I ordered the tortilla soup. The dish arrived topped with oily tortilla strips and big, dense chunks of cheese that reminded me of paneer and really did nothing to enhance the dish. After a cursory taste, I removed the toppings. The broth was okay but not great, and the vegetables were overcooked. My dining partners were similarly unimpressed.

This is sad, because Laredo's was my favorite Mexican place when I first moved to Madison. The last several visits have netted sub-par food. Not to mention that I live in DeFo now, and Aranda's is just around the corner. (If you want really good Mexican food at a friendly, family-owned place, I'd suggest going there.)"}
{"text":"We have been there twice and have been impressed both times.  By far the best mexican in madison.  We used to thoroughly enjoy a southwestern restaurant called Pasquals but their quality of food at Hillsdale has declined immensely over the past year.  Laredo is always consistent, efficient and tasty!!"}
{"text":"The food was underwhelming and lacking flavor (i got the taco al pastor). The service was mediocre, no one asked me how my food was tasting after I got it (I need lime to add some sort of flavor to the food but alas). I wouldn't particularly be inclined to go back."}
{"text":"Ok margaritas and pretty good service...but the food in general is just not great at all. Not authentic Mexican and not good in general. The owners or whoever runs this place appear to have given up. The menu could be freshened up. I hear there's a better Laredo's somewhere in Madison. I ordered the pork carnitas and they were pretty much the only good thing I've had there...I don't think I'll be going there again unless it's during a late night and I'm in need of a margarita."}
{"text":"I have been to 2 locations, Fish Hatchery and Lien, and both times was uninterested in finishing my meal.  Stale tortillas, bad cheese, bland sauces... go to Taqueria El Pastor or Taqueria Guadalajara for tastier, more authentic meals.

Heck, you can do slightly better just down the road at Casa del Sol."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the churro \"dessert\". The description in the menu stated that it would be \"fruit-filled\", and served with a \"chocolate dipping sauce\". The dish arrived at our table last night and my husband and I just stared at in blankly for a second, no words, since it wasn't at all what we expected, and it was completely different than the menu description. There was absolutely no explanation given, but the churro had no fruit filling whatsoever (it was like a plain gas station churro) and no chocolate dipping sauce, just a drizzling of caramel. It tasted ok... But how can you say one thing in the menu and give something else? Probably not the best practice."}
{"text":"Nope-not authentic, pre-prepared, the chips are way too greasy and flavorless, and every entree tastes the same as every other entree. I went there with a party of five.l tasted everyone's entree. Tasted like we were all eating the same thing.
I have not had authentic Mexican anywhere in Madison. I'm told by my friend from Mexico, that yellow cheese is not used in Mexican food, nor are black olives."}
{"text":"I had combination 18 which was fair at best.  My wife had the taco salad and she rates it slightly higher.  I'm not impressed enough to come back.  Service was slow, but with only two other tables I'm not sure why."}
{"text":"Love the steak tacos - prepared like they do on Maxwell Street, Chicago.  Fiesta Quesadilla is my other stand-by (grilled chicken and shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions and sliced avocado).

Original blended margarita is the best in town!"}
{"text":"I love me some Laredo's.

First, the bad: the chips and salsa are pretty disappointing. They look amazing and smell so good, but just aren't that great.

The tacos are solid, all of them. Really well done and not too complex

But, here's what is amazing-the Farmer's Quesadilla and the Tortitas.
The Tortitas are barbecued meat and queso fresca on beautiful pretzel buns. Amazingly delicious. So good.
The Farmer's Quesadilla is spinach, black beans, corn, (maybe onions), and cheese.
It's served with guac, sour cream, and queso. All of which are fantastic on it."}
{"text":"Wide menu, fast friendly service, easy to get in and out at lunch. It's not fancy by any stretch, a little run down to be honest, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Laredo's won't win any awards for best Mexican food - but, it is affordable, the food is good, the portions are decently sized, and the service has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Guacamole, made table-side!!  Staff is always efficient and friendly.  Disappointed they removed shrimp and mushroom quesadillas from menu"}
{"text":"I go out quite a bit. I also judge restaurants on peticular dishes. This place had the worst cheese burrito ever. It was made of white cheese? The same cheese they used for their queso blanco. Which wasn't that bad but MUCH to creamy for anything to be in a burrito. I guess I expect an orange cheese or at least a good cheese that is melty and hot. Not lukewarm and almost solid. Rice and beans were what they were. Didn't have high hopes and they didn't dash them. I just feel like it could have been so much better. I would never go back. Downvote."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Mexican restaurants in Wisconsin. Consistently delicious food, speedy service, friendly staff, and decent prices. We frequent this location. It's my husband's favorite. He always gets the Rio Bravo burrito. I always get the chicken chimichanga without red sauce and with extra guacamole. Either that or the steak and chicken fajitas. The salsa is perfection too."}
{"text":"This is my second try at Laredo's, and I'll admit that it is better than the first.

My first time also happened to be my first mexican restaurant in Wisconsin, period. I had high expectations coming from Kansas, the land of the mexican restaurants, and I was let down.

Upon having tried probably 10 mexican restaurants in the Madison area, I guess this one isn't so bad afterall. It is your run of the mill mexican food. I'd say this warrants 3 stars.

Spend the extra 2 bucks for a soda here. This is one of those places where the water tastes like it came out of a tin can.

This place is pretty empty both times I've been, and the food comes super fast. (I get easy bean burritos though) They have good service overall.

I guess I'll be back in the future. Sigh"}
{"text":"Not your typical restaurant visit, so possibly not a typical review!
We had worked hard all day landscaping and really only wanted to celebrate a bit over some margaritas. Didn't want to go out for dinner and planned on just picking up some carry out from Qdoba's down the street (though my hubby doesn't care for rice burritos), so we called in an order of chicken enchiladas and shredded beef enchiladas on our way to Great Dane. We walked in and saw Laredo's had a nice bar, and so of course we had margaritas there...ordered a whole pitcher as we knew that was the cheapest option since we planned on having at least a couple each!
The chips and salsa showed up immediately and the hostess/waitress/bartender brought our enchiladas out before our margaritas were ready. Okay, check. Set those aside for when we get home. We then proceeded to thoroughly enjoy about four medium sized margaritas each (for about $19, which is a little over $2 for a very delicious and perfect tequila portioned drink!!). We were worried that the enchiladas might not be enough food so we threw in an order of burritos, one chicken/one shredded beef, for about $7 total. They packed chips and salsa with each bag of food, so we got a bag with the enchiladas and another with the burritos.
We walked out very happy in that we probably spent less on food than the rice-packed burritos at the Qrobus down the street (6 enchiladas = $13, 2 burritos = $7).
Now the taste test, as we used to visit Laredo's on Whitney for lunch often, but my hubby always found them boring and that same-old-Mexican food.
We should have stopped ordering at the enchiladas. Why - Because they were three very large enchiladas and more than enough for a meal!! We had the burritos the next night and they were both huge...and delicious, even being a day old!!!
What can I say, sometimes a place just exceeds your expectations. My hubby wants to go back because he has a crush on that hostess/waitress/bartender lady as well. Yeah, she was cute, and she knew her stuff.
Not the best Mexican food in the world, and maybe five stars is overboard, but on one of those nights when it all clicked and was exactly (and more) than we hoped - bravo!"}
{"text":"We tried Laredo's for supper last night. We arrived a little after 6:00 pm. There were a few full tables but it was mostly empty. Tile floors, wooden tables and benches, lots of color, it looks like a fairly standard Mexican restaurant.

The hostess seated us and gave us menus and our waiter was over shortly with chips and salsa. We were in a hurry, (although we didn't state that) and so while he was there we ordered our dinners at the same time we ordered our drinks. The chips were excellent -- hearty and crunchy. The salsa, what there was of it, was also very good. We were out of salsa long before we were out of chips. There was no offer to refill the salsa.

I'd say it was less than ten minutes before our food arrived. I had ordered combination #11 which was a burrito, an enchilada, and a taco. I don't know why I expected rice and beans, they were not included. It was all OK, but not much better than Taco Bell. My partner ordered the Tamales with shredded pork. This came with rice and beans and the tamales were great. The pork on top was chunky and dripping with flavorful fat. The tamales were also stuffed with shredded pork and had just the right ratio of meat vs masa. The beans were creamy and the rice fluffy.

We were halfway through our meal when the drinks arrived. The large house margarita is truly large and probably enough (volume) for two people to drink. However, it is not very strong and was not very remarkable.

What was remarkable was the speed of the food delivery and the tamales. Everything else was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Quick lunches and decent prices.  The tortillas always seem stale though, either in a burrito or taco.  Guac is great!  Ambiance is a bit to be desired.  The floor is concrete and it gets annoyingly loud if you stop in after 6pm."}
{"text":"We visit Laredo's every so often because it's fast and conveniently located.  The service is prompt and friendly.  We are able to get in and out quickly, even during busy hours.  And we like their margaritas.

The food itself is spotty.  The enchiladas are a safe choice; they are what you would expect from a midrange Mexican place.  The chips and salsa are passable, and I do like their fundido appetizer dish. 

But their fajitas are terrible.  They severely over cook the meat.  Dry, tough meat is the most obvious way to destroy a fajita dish.  Their tacos are plain and, again, dry.  The burritos are similarly plain, lacking any kind of pizzazz.  It's hard to imagine a Mexican restaurant that can't get the basics right, but there you have it.

Madison in general is a Mexican food desert, so it's not like Laredo's is the only average place around.  While I can't exactly recommend Laredo's, I also can't say you are going to find amazing options down the street."}
{"text":"It's good to be clean, but the smell of bleach overpowered any food aromas.  Bland Mexican food for the Midwestern palate.  Good salsa.  Excellent margarita made up for any food deficit, though.  Friendly service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I did not expect that much somehow.  Maybe because this is so close from my home.  However, I went with my family for lunch and another dinner a few days later because the first time was good.  First time, we ordered lunch specials and they are good in terms of the price and the taste...

We went again for dinner a few days later.  We had frozen Margaritas and Beer.  We ordered a Burrito, Fajita, and Taco salad.  Burrito was by far bigger than any other Burritos I have seen before.  Even my son could not finish it.  The Fajita of my wife was good too.  

We will definitely go to this place again."}
{"text":"When we walked in the host barely looked at us from the host stand and said \"go sit wherever you want. 
The absolute worst Taco salad I have ever had. It was more like spoiled taco soup. The young waiter had a horrible attitude so I thought that complaining would have not made a difference. At the end of our experience he tossed the cc folders on the table never said thank you. Upon leaving not a word from the 
host stand. I am not asking them to go overboard but make your customers feel welcome at least. Not like we are annoying them."}
{"text":"Fast service, great drinks and guacamole! Authentic American restaurant with a Mexican theme"}
{"text":"I go to Laredo's regularly because they're close. Also the food is typically pretty good. Love me their fajitas. The staff is always helpful. My main complaint is that the margaritas are pretty awful. They taste like dirty dishwater. Stay away from those and you're golden!"}
{"text":"Sub par service to match inconsistent food quality

The cheese was mostly a Velveeta type taste (yuk! and strange) with just a hint of real cheese taste. The salsa had two different strengths. Beans were runny, but that is more a preference. The beef is bad tasting. The pulled chicken is good. The chips were good (this time).

The service was slow - and we were the only table in the place. We asked about sitting outside (nice sidewalk seating in the shade), but since there was only one waitress, outside was closed. Understandable, but with one table expected decent service inside. We did not get refills until after we got our change on our check (of bad 'off the gun' ice tea broth and lemon slivers). My suggestion, management needs to be on site, as well as care about training. Other location is only slightly better.

I have tried this place a few times over the last few years - consistently off and not caring about the quality or service. Bar was fun with happy hour specials.

Interesting story about wage theft by owners - http://www.channel3000.com/news/Worker-owed-6-000-in-Laredo-s-back-wages-speaks-out/39666088"}
{"text":"Initial wait was kind of long.
Food came quick though after ordering.
They never came back to refill or drinks.
We waited while after we were done eating to ask for the bill.
When he did come back he didnt offer more water just took the glasses away. Wasnt very enthused. Jk he just brought us drinks back so ill give 2 stars :].
Idk not the best. Prices are around 10 minimum for all average meals."}
{"text":"Been here before and was ok... Last night was a deal breaker bad service + bad food =never coming again! I hate to not give places another chance but it was awful. I will let a place slide if food isn't the best if they have great service or vice versa..."}
{"text":"A strong three. I've had my ups and downs with Laredo's on the whole, but this location had no major complaints. We came in for a super late lunch/extra early dinner on a Saturday and the place was pretty dead. We were seated in a booth under the roof/awning which was fun and more than enough space for the two of us. 

Our orders were taken quickly, chips and salsa were delivered, and our food came out fresh and hot. I got a chicken chimichanga that came with a good amount of \"salad\", sour cream, and guac. The plate is served with cheese-topped refried beans. There's a good amount of food, but it's not as gut-busting as many Mexican restaurants. I also love rice, so I'd be more into the plate if it also included rice like most places. 

After our food was dropped off service stalled; we were the only people in the dining room and while I don't think we were quite forgotten about, we also weren't checked on. We were finally able to get our check and head out. 

It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, but I'd go back if it were convenient. For the price point and overall enjoyment, though, there are a few places that come in higher on the list."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip to Madison, WI...and the group there invited me to lunch.  Laredo's is a solid Tex-Mex restaurant...they even had one of my all time favorites, Huevos con Chorizo.  I ordered my fav...and it had a bit of an off flavor, probably just the Chorizo that they used.  It did not have a lot of heat to the sausage, but, overall, was enjoyable.

Service, at lunch, was pretty good...although the check took a few extra minutes."}
{"text":"I've sampled a few different dishes from here before and, for the most part, they've all been pretty average. But one of my favorite Mexican dish, tamales, are very impressive here! They not authentic per se but they do make for excellent comfort food. Their guacamole is also good. Their horchata isn't, again, very authentic but it's still pretty tasty and a great value. I would probably come here again for the tamales but I would probably go elsewhere for anything else. The service wasn't unfriendly and was prompt and attentive enough."}
{"text":"First, the reason for my 5 stars review is based on my personal expectation: an Americanized Mexican restaurant. I'm not expecting delicious, authentic Mexican food; if I was I know where in Madison to find it. 

I've been to this location consistently since the beginning of the summer. The service has always been prompt and courteous, regardless of the waiter/waitress I am assigned. And what actually prompted me to write this review, in the first place, was how fast we always get our food. Honestly, probably within 10 minutes of placing our order. It is quite amazing. As far as the food goes, (again, maybe it's not a fair review because my expectations are pretty low) it's decent and I like eating it. It's not by an means delicious but it's also not terrible. Some of my favorites are: the Enchiladas Guadalajara, Pacifico soup, and the Quesadilla Mexicali. I guess you can say I put more weight on the service than the food. Their staff are just so nice and genuine!  I would go back again...and probably will."}
{"text":"It should be said this review is only for their chips and salsa which always hit the spot. They aren't supremely special or anything just consistently tasty. I do t really like anything on their menu so I usually order rice and beans leave a big tip and eat lots of chips and salsa! Oh and margaritas if I'm not driving!"}
{"text":"This has been a Mexican staple or go to place for us for years.   The service and food has always been good.   This past Friday,  after deciding to grab a quick bite,  we decided to go to Laredos.  We wanted to eat outside,  so our hostess sat us outside.  We got chips, like always, and they were great.    That was the last time we saw any wait staff.   We waited,  waited, waited, waited....... no one came to take our drink order let alone food order.   After 15-20 minutes of waiting and finishing the chips, no one came.  We left. 

Needless to say,  we will not be coming back.   Seems like a lot of restaurants in our area are suffering from this."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was good. Somewhat slow at lunch. But in their defense, it was busy. Price was right also."}
{"text":"The food at this Laredo's is not as good as the one on the westside of Madison. I have been into this location a handful of times and it's ok food. Not super great, not terrible. Somewhere in the middle. It has a decent bar with a nice drink/beer selection. I like the guacamole made table side. A cool way to start your meal. We had lime margaritas on the rocks and they had pretty nice balanced flavor. I love their fajita quesadilla lunch menu item. I've had it multiple times and have not been disappointed. I think I may have had a couple of dreams about it even. Love the queso on top and the edible garnish on the side. Add that sour cream and guacamole to the top of that quesadilla. Don't be shy. Just add it on top. You will be pleased you did. Slice through that layered goodness and take a bite. Delish! They have some really good combination plates too. A nice variety for your palette. I like that this one is convenient for me, but I think I would make the drive to their west side location to get a better tasting meal."}
{"text":"Will not be returning. This place Nickel and Dimes you for everything. Dishes come without rice on the side, salsa was 1.50 extra. They short you on tortillas and charge you $2 for extras. We shared a lunch fajita plate, which was $13 and our bill came to $26 for \"extras\" that every other Mexican place provides. 

The inside is loud, not clean, seating reminds you of a cafeteria. 

Skip this place"}
{"text":"I go here sometimes for work lunch, reluctantly.  The food is typical large restaurant American/Mexican - refried beans, rice, and iceberg lettuce and diced tomato \"salad\" with everything.  Prices and portions are fine but, overall, just not impressed."}
{"text":"I love coming to this particular location because of their table side guacamole. They come over to your table and make the guac your way in front of you. Delicious. The food at Laredo's is good \"American\" Mexican food. If you are looking for authentic this is not the place. However, that does not mean the food is not delicious. I enjoy their fish tacos and the parilla. Their salsa is delicious and mild and the service is good. 

Portions are large so be prepared for taking some leftovers home!"}
{"text":"Laredo's (not to be confused with Cantina Laredo) is a local Mexican restaurant in Madison. I have been here a couple of times (once for lunch and once for dinner). Overall the food is decent, and relatively inexpensive. For lunch, they have a variety of combination platters.  For dinner the last time, I got the chicken and steak fajitas. The fajitas did not come out sizzling hot, but they were hot. Taste was decent (I've had better but these were not bad). Laredo's is good but I would not necessarily make a special trip to have a meal here."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in Laredos. Salsa and chips were okay. Margs were way to syrupy. Beans had no flavor. Everything was so so lackluster. Service was horrible - that attitude of \"you are bothering me\" is definitely the vibe I got from our server. Won't be back. Prices were not good for what they offered."}
{"text":"The restaurant wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. We had the breakfast burrito (good, just enough spice and HUGE) and the double burritos (tasty, sauce was good) dinners. We were surprised that the price didn't include a side. The chips and salsa were really good and fresh. We will visit again since it is so close."}
{"text":"A dinning experience is supposed to be fun; it's supposed to be relaxing; and, it is supposed to be an escape from the stressors of life. Unfortunately, I don't think Laredo's knows how to do any of those three things. 

Our food came out literally five minutes after being ordered. It came out before our drinks arrived. Our server never checked on us after delivering our drinks. After poking at our food for 10 minutes and deciding it wasn't worth eating, I had to go track down our waiter and pay our bill. 

Food is bland and an Americanized version of Mexican food. Service is below average. Ambiance is lacking. Just don't go."}
{"text":"Fast and greasy.  Taste is OK but don't expect high quality, you will get full here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress charged us $15 for a drink we didn't even ordered then wouldn't take it off our bill when we tried to correct it. Food was good wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food... The best I've found in Madison. The chips and salsa were especially good and the waiter was efficient and friendly. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The sauce on the enchiladas looked and tasted canned. Flavorless rice and beans were on the side. This restaurant is super noisy. They were nice enough to bring a birthday treat, but the fried ice cream tasted like it had been fried in old oil. They accommodated our large group but one drink order came 20 minutes after it was ordered. I have to wonder if the people rating this place over two stars had too many drinks or are related to the owners. Another telling sign was the all white crowd. Come to El Caminos in Sheboygan for better food!"}
{"text":"One of the best if not THE BEST mexican restaurant that I have found since relocating to Madison.  I may even go as far as saying the best I have had even in California for the past 4 years.  Great prices and even better food.  Servers are always on top of their game."}
{"text":"Just came from this place, first time ever going there, and it was probably the worst customer service experiences I've had in a long time. The waitress, Irene was rude to the point that I left zero for the tip and I've tipped well even for lousy service before, but I refused to give get one cent. I ordered hard shell tacos and the shells were straight from the box, not warmed or anything, so when you bit into them they were chewy and tough, not crispy. When we asked about them and if they were cooked she was like no, so me and the other person who ordered them asked for shell instead. Instead of doing what 99.9% of servers would naturally do, take it back and give us what we asked her for, she said...you ordered this and stood there a while before taking it back. 

She brought back the soft shell tacos and they weren't good. They just weren't and mine had a ton of sour cream, which I specifically said no sour cream. I ate half of one and the other person I was with took a couple bites and decided not to eat anymore because it wasn't good. When she came back and he said he was finished because he didn't like them, she said \"Why?\" with an attitude. That's when we asked for the manager. She said he's not here and we said...so there's no one in charge right now? Then she went and got someone. The guy was awesome and he apologized for the bad service and took one of the taco dinners off the bill ( I kept mine to doctor them up later). If I go back, I will specifically request that Irene NOT be my waitress."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome!!  It was so good we've now been back a couple of times and always and it's been consistent. The sad thing though is the news story that ran this spring about how the company isn't taking care of their employees. 

Ugh!  The food and service were great, but I don't want to support a company that doesn't treat their employees fairly."}
{"text":"The margarita was far from good, it was literally shaved iced with a ton of coloring. My food order was wrong and the burrito wasn't good. The service was terrible. Definitely wouldn't eat at this one again."}
{"text":"Decent food. Good size portions. Very inexpensive. Fast service.

The food is pretty good...not the best Mexican food you'll ever have, but solid. I've never been disappointed. You get what you pay for, if you're looking for upscale food, go to Eldorado Grill. If you are looking for fast cheap pretty good food, go to Laredos. Don't forget to order a margarita!

The tableside guacamole is kind of cool to watch and tasty."}
{"text":"I used to work near by to this particular Laredos, so I visited often. We would order for pick-up for lunch often, have an after-work cocktail every now and then, and occasionally gather larger groups of coworkers together here to celebrate a promotion, say farewell, or congratulate a retirement, etc. 

Now the food is pretty typical American-Mexican. If you're looking for super authentic, this is not your place. But if you're looking something quick and easy and yummy, this is a win. I have eaten a lot of Laredo's meals over the years and there's not a single time I can recall having ever been upset, unsatisfied, or disappointed. Likewise, I cannot think of a single time that really made me say WOW either. 

They typically have lunch specials everyday which is really nice. They are really fast, too, during the lunch period. I have experienced slower-than-expected service during dinner visits, but at lunch they really seem to have it figured out. Perfect for those of us who don't have a long lunch break from work but still want something hot and delicious. 

The bartenders have always been awesome when I have been in. They mix up delicious specialty cocktails and are fun to chat with. They put up with my rowdy work crew with smiles on their faces even when I know we are being loud/needy :)"}
