{"text":"We have lived about a mile from rip Rico's for 4 years now and we just tried it. It was fantastic, great service great food reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Not sure what prices the other Natalie W is used to, but i found Rio Rico to be very well priced.  Average price for a meal is about $7-$9.  Not exactly Scottsdale pricing.  Food was pretty decent.  It is a bit like a glorified taco stand, but emphasis on glorified.  You are not going to find ritzy cuisine.  All in all, for what it is is, I give it a solid 4 out of 5.  
Clean, Friendly, Decent Food.  Worth going, I will try it again for sure."}
{"text":"Rio Rico is a very friendly plsce to dine. With young children, they are very accommodating. Aside from a friendly wait staff, the food is very authentic. My mother who is a great purveyor of Mexican food even approves. Very friendly and hospitable owners. Definitely a return visit is in order."}
{"text":"Unimpressive, again. Waited forever to be acknowledged and seated. Ordered ceviche, out. Ordered Chile relleno, out. Settled for crispy beef taco with beans, was soggy and wet. 2nd and last attempt to like this place. I hoped their move would help... bummer."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa, delicious generous portions, and very nice staff."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while now and finally went tonight for dinner I had the Crane asada burrito my wife had the carne asada tacos the food was good steak could have been a little more medium but good.  The wife had a Margarita that was pretty good not over kill, however our waitress was very cute but young, she seemed to be new or not very with it but she was very slow. So it did ruin it a bit but the food was tasty...will go back"}
{"text":"A really nice, family-owned restaurant. Solid shrimp fajitas, perfectly seasoned. Friendly and attentive service. A great answer to cookie cutter corporate mexican food. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant. Mom and dad does all the cooking, very casual. Kinda hidden behind the gas station. Give it a try it's worth it."}
{"text":"Never know what the food tastes like, waited for over 45 mins, with 9 open, dirty tables. In the time we waited, the couple ahead of us sat, ordered, and ate."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant!  Everything is fresh and made from scratch.  The salsa and guacamole are delicious.  The tamales and enchiladas are my favorite items to order but the rest of the family loves the fajitas and carne asada.  Our daughter loves the camarones enchilada.  The desserts are so yummy but the food is so good that we rarely have room for it.  On top of the delicious food, the staff and owners are so nice.  We have NEVER had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"For anyone looking for a great authentic mexican food this is the place.  We came in on Cinco de Mayo and they were pack but the customer service from the entrance to when we paid the bill was 5. Totally recommend this restaurant to everyone:)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden Gem; the only reason it does not show up on reviews is people don't know it is there.  The place is hidden behind a vets and a gas station.  But the food is REALLY good and very inexpensive; everything is freshly made to order and is very authentic.  The test for me of a really good Mexican joint is the Chile Relleno, theirs is the best I have tasted, I have to have them at least once a week from here.  It is not greasy or mushy, has just the right amount of heat, real Mexican cheese inside and a lovely soft batter, they do not smother it in cheese but instead cover it in a nice rich sauce yummy.

Please give this place a try, you will wonder how you stayed away so long."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rio Rico's for years! Maria and her family do a great job of offering up some fantastic food at very very reasonable prices. The Verde green chili is very good as well as many of the other dishes

Another cool part of this restaurant is the fact that it's not a one hour wait on a Friday or Saturday night. All-around great food great prices!"}
{"text":"Hey, if the star rating was for guacamole, it would be a 5!  Fresh and creamy, seriously good guac.  Green chile's tomatillo sauce, fresh and tasty.  The place has improved a lot in the last three years.  No longer ordering at the counter...nice change.  Warm and friendly local owner."}
{"text":"Rio Ricos is a family owned restaurant  that has been owned and operated for some time. I myself do not like Mexican food but from all the different Mexican food restaurants my family has dragged me to, this is the one I can admit is delicious. The service is great. The food is both authentic and healthy. If you want to just sit at their quaint cozy sports bar,l and just grab a beer and chips, they are more than welcoming."}
{"text":"Wow, I rarely feel compelled to give a restaurant such a bad review but Rio Rico earned it tonight.  We came for Cinco de Mayo which we expected to be busy so we showed up around 5 pm.  There weren't many people waiting but those that were had to figure out for that they had to sign themselves in to be seated (no greeter on Cinco de Mayo??).  The wait wasn't bad but once we sat it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to show up and ask if we had ordered drinks.  At that point we hadn't even met our server, received water, chips, salsa, menus...etc., so no, we hadn't ordered drinks.  Ordering was a total debacle.  Our server appeared to have never taken an order before.   We finally got through that ordeal only to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food.  To make matters worse, the tables near us, all of which were seated well after we were, had received their fajitas long before we did.  The server noticed that ours still hadn't arrived and assured us that they'd be right out...and they were, completely uncooked. The peppers and onions couldn't have been more raw.  They clearly forgot our order and then tried to rush it.  Whatever, we just wanted to eat and get the heck out.  Then the bill came and surprise!  We were charged full price for the happy hour drinks and of course no from the server or on the receipt that our night was a total disaster.  The food was sub par, the service was horrible and the staff seemed completely oblivious to the fact that we were being ignored.  We definitely will not be back and i would highly recommend that any prospective diners spend their time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The family that owns it are super sweet and definitely know how to cook some Mexican food. We moved up here from Tucson 4 years ago and have been trying different restaurants to remind us of our favorites from home and we finally found it. We take everyone we know to Rio Rico. Order home style chicken tacos, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and friendly service! Love the chimi! I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Food is good drinks are good however service is horrible had to actually get up and ask for more drinks and when paying for dinner was asked why we weren't leaving a tip! FYI paid with debit but left cash on the table. First for me lol but will try it again sometime."}
{"text":"This review is about their chips,salsa, and rice. I have not tried anything else but wow it was good!! I am a rice addict pretty much and especially Spanish rice. I finally found my go to restaurant for my rice fix. Their salsa was so fresh and tasted amazing and their chips were awesome!!"}
{"text":"This unassuming place has always been easy to avoid. ...Attached to a veterinary clinic, that's just weird. Right?
Wrong. This place is great! Family run, with solid classic Mexican grub. 
I haven't tried them since they relocated. I will update the post once we have checked them out at their new location. (We were told that the vet clinic who owned the building wanted to expand, which caused the restaurant to relocate.)"}
{"text":"Mario was amazing.the food was affordable( like every dish was under 10 bucks). great portions and really good $3 house margaritas during happy hour!!! We will be back !!**happy hour is from 2-7 in the summer hours**"}
{"text":"Worst carne asada I've ever had in my life!  Being the first time visiting this restaurant, I figured I'd try something familiar to compare to other places we've eaten.  My first impression of the food was not favorable due to the stale chips they served us.  Then the service.  About 20 minutes after we arrived we finally ordered-not due to indecision but due to lack of attention from the server.  We waited about a half hour for our food to come, and it was lucky we only had two ordering because the family of four next to us ordered before us and still hadn't received their food by the time we left.  Once we recieved it, the food was bland, very underseasoned and as mentioned before, horrible carne asada.  The one shining point of the entire night was the guacamole dip, which was good but not worth $4.75.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The service is excellent,  very friendly staff.  The owners work as servers as well.  The entire staff is very knowledgeable about their food.  
The food has its own unique flavor.  They have a lot seafood fare as well, Mexican Baja style.  The fish tacos are especially good.   

I'm from the Midwest originally and the down home atmosphere I feel when dining there makes you feel like a local. They truly appreciate you eating at their place.

The combination of service, atmosphere and quality of food makes this not only one of our favorite restaurants but our favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible!!!  We are regulars here and service has never been good but this time it took the cake.  We waited 1/2 hour just to order.  After 1.5 hours, three people in our party finally got there food.  Then the rest of our good trickled in.  Worst part was owner never once even apologized.  In fact she seemed annoyed and put out the entire time.  That will be the last time we patronize their restaurant."}
{"text":"So good! Authentic Mexican food, everyone loved their dishes. Guac was great and I'm a guac snob! The bad reviews are people that like places like Chipotle."}
{"text":"We were seated and a mature lady gave us one menu and said she would get us another one. After around 10 minutes  she came back with menu and asked if we wanted a drink. She seemed irritated that we wanted Negra Modelo. Why? She brought it and water and we ordered. No smile again. Meanwhile  she chatted with other customers and took her time with them. Several nice helpers asked if we wanted more  salsa and chips. Our server walked by several times and never asked. By now all beer is gone and she did not ask if we wanted more. When she finally brought the food she just plopped it down and started to walk away.  My partner asked if he could have more beer. She looked at me and said with an air of annoyance, \" and YOU too?\" We won't return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great! The food is ridiculously fast even when it's swamped and is always delish!"}
{"text":"New favorite place for take-out (Used https://www.grubhub.com/)
Super cheap for the amount and quality you get. Had the carintas tacos and taquitos, loved all of it.
Can reccomend them enough."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!  I've actually been eating there for quite some time, but just now getting around to reviewing them.  They are hands down, what you want in any restaurant.  Their prices are cheap, portions large and it's majority run by family.  Their \"mom and pop\" atmosphere is what really keeps me coming back.  They are always friendly, and their food is authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"After reading some positive reviews we decided to give this one a shot.  Ordered Beef Tacos and Chili Colorado and a couple of Corona's.  We found the service to be genuine and considerate.  But unfortunately the food was just okay.  Certainly not bad but nothing real memorable.

We continue to struggle finding good Mexican food in the East Valley.  Just nothing that is really worth hitting up as there are alternative options that win out over a so-so dinner."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Mesa. Wanted authentic Mexican cuisine, no chains, this place was great. My brother-in-law is very picky, he LOVED it! Nuff said."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Saturday night a little before 6 and had no problem being seated.

We had the fajitas (I had chicken, he had combo) and they were delicious! The combo fajitas were fantastic! Plenty of meat and peppers.

Chips and salsa were great, but I would definitely skip the queso in the future. 

We read reviews saying the service was terrible, but our service was fantastic! We'd go back."}
{"text":"The Best Mexican food in the East Valley. Our friends from China were so impressed but the quality and the large servings. The service was equally as good. It is a drive from CG but well worth it."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't review anything my husband, Jim W. reviews.  I mean, what's the point?  He voices my opinion anyway.  But in this case I just had to post.

We love Mexican food.  We have enjoyed it extensively everywhere we've lived except Boston, where we longed for it and settled for average, albeit overpriced, local chain fare.  But of all the places I've lived, no selection of Mexican cuisine is as rich and diverse as what we find in the valley.  And now we know, without doubt, whose is worst.

We wanted a bite before a movie so, when we arrived at Rio Rico, we told them we were in a hurry and had 40 minutes.  They said they could accommodate that.  But the service was some of the worst I've ever seen.  It was impossible to get anything in a timely fashion and we usually had to ask several times.  A couple of times a harried-looking staffer asked if someone else had done something -- taken our order, given us the check -- and then growled when we told her no.

The food was absolutely terrible.  No one liked what they ordered.  I had carne asada, one of my favorite dishes.  When it finally arrived I was surprised.  When I had those birkenstocks resoled in Boston a couple of years ago I never thought I'd see the soles again but there they were, charred on my plate.  The steak was the driest, most burned piece of meat ever set before me in a restaurant.  The beans were tasteless and the rice was so-so.  My youngest didn't like her enchiladas (which were supposed to be chicken but were cheese) and my oldest couldn't stomach her huevos New Mexico.  Jim said his shrimp was okay but the sauce was spicy though utterly without flavor.  So much for the food.

The water was skunked.  It was absolutely undrinkable, which you knew before you tasted it because the smell alone kept your lips from the cup.  We ordered sodas, which we didn't intend to get.  They were semi-skunked but you needed something to cut the spicy yet flavorless stuff, whether it was the sauce or the bottled salsa.

So when you read Jim W's review and he says don't go, listen.  In fact, if you want excellent Mexican food in the southeast valley, I wholeheartedly recommend El Ranchero on Chandler Blvd. about a block east of the 10.  For $7 or less you will receive a heaping plate of incredible, authentic Mexican food.  We went there for lunch today in an effort to erase the trauma of last night's dinner at Rio Rico's.  Thankfully, it worked."}
{"text":"Today wife & I had a late lunch.  We started with guacamole, chips and salsa.  I had beef enchiladas topped with green sauce, wife had SHRIMP COCKTAIL, Mexican-style cocktail made with tomato juice, vegetable juice, fresh pico de gallo and avocado.  The only thing to say is:  Wow! Great food.  This is our favorite Mexican restaurant!  Everything is fresh and made from scratch, beans and rice are homemade and delicious, flavors are tasty, their salsa has a bit of a kick, and the chips and guacamole are wonderful.  All the servers use a phone app to take orders and a bonus is the attentive service we had from friendly employees.  We will return....."}
{"text":"I ate here last week and have to say that it is worthy of three stars with the good attentive service however the entire time I was eating a small child was screaming at the top of his lungs , while mom and the restaurant did absolutely nothing about it. I will go one more time and see if things are better but their camarones a la diabla were not very good and they did not make it nearly hot enough for me. Obviously I will try another dish to see if it is cooked any better than my favorite."}
{"text":"Hubby & I wanted to try New Mexican restaurant, we are new to the location. We were unsatisfied with the service and the food. I'm been looking around for our waitress to flag her for refills even our check table is filled with our dirty plates & even dessert!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Mexican.  I love going in and seeing the same faces every time.  Food is consistently good.  Always enjoy the family feel there."}
{"text":"The food was alright. Didn't really taste very authentic. Although the staff was nice, the service could have been better. The waitress serving us forgot to grab our drinks and then we waited another 15 minutes just to get our check. 

I will not return!"}
{"text":"We love this place, especially the chile rellenos..  The service is always excellent, and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since it first opened as it was very close to my house when I lived in AZ. The family who owns it is super nice and always friendly. The food is average. Nothing spectacular, but it is better than any of the chain sit-down restaurants around. Service can be sketchy. They have generally employed very young girls as servers who are not experienced. Not necessarily rude, but not always super attentive. If you are served by the owners, especially Mario, you will be in good shape. Delivering the check promptly has always been a challenge for them no matter who is serving, so you will likely have to flag someone down to get it. Chips and salsa are good, but be warned about the water if that is all you will be drinking."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food!!! My family and I will be back. Best Mexican food I have ever eaten, hands down!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't like oh wow this is awesome. Good portions, didn't wait too long. Water tastes nasty...even with a lemon. The margaritas were way too strong..like seriously close to drunk off one. 

The restaurant appeared clean and neat. Chips and salsa were free and decent. I'd go back if I lived in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"So glad a friend brought us here, otherwise we probably would have never come across it. Everything was hot and delicious, authentic tasting. Service was friendly and prompt. Looking forward to going again tonight! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, I had the Mole, the service was a little slow with the food but I expect that when its made fresh not scooped from a container then nuked. This will now be the go to place for Mexican food for my family. Our bill for a family of 5 (three kids) was $35."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to rio Rico's many times. Every time I'm pleased. I have lived in AZ all my life and I've had a lot of Mexican food. I like it. A lot of Mexican restaurants are pretty much the same to me. The only difference ends up being how crazy and loud the decorations and music are. Rio Rico's is nice and quiet and the service is good and the food is good. They don't knock my socks off but they are reasonably priced and I keep coming back even with all the many options around here."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Rio Rico for the first time last week. We were even lucky enough to make it in time for happy hour. The house margaritas were delicious!  We had the carnitas as well as the chile relleno with beef flauta and every single bite was great. To top it off, we received awesome service by our waiter, Mario. When we return we will definitely ask for him!"}
{"text":"I was concerned. I mean, it's next door to a veterinarian facility. Think of the jokes man!
But wait... what if it's not a joke? What if those poor, terminal pets...
Anywhoo, I suggest putting that thought out of your mind and repeatedly visiting this place. It is delicious!!
The crab enchiladas are ridiculous. So are the beef tacos, the nachos, and every one of the kids items :)
And pair any menu item w/ one of their margaritas...
You won't even remember the puppies!!! :)"}
{"text":"we just moved from Scottsdale to Gilbert and we are so glad we found this place great prices and great Mexican food and a nice atmosphere would recommend to anyone who's hungry...."}
{"text":"I visited Rio Rico with my family in Arizona recently. I was not excited about the place when we arrived because my family is drawn to mediocre Mexican-American restaurants. I figured this would be another in a long list of similar places we'd been to. 

We were a group of seven. We were seated right away at a long table. The service was excellent in this family-run restaurant. The server, who is the owner's son, called my brother and his whole family by name, and was gracious and welcoming to my elderly traveling companions and me. 

The menu is nothing special--just what you'd expect to find. From my meal, here's what stood out: 

I ordered chile verde. The green sauce was excellent. It was as good as mine from home, perhaps a little better! It had a sharp herbal taste and was thin, bright and flavorful with no thickeners or fillers. Very nice. the pork was tender and flavorful and perfectly paired with the interesting sauce. 

The other standout was the flan. Absolutely delicious and much better than the flan I make at home. It was tender, fragile and creamy (more milk, fewer eggs) in a nice caramelized sugar sauce. Deeeee-licious.  I always use too many eggs and often overcook it (when you get the bubbles), so this flan was a treat. 

The rest of the table ordered the usual numbered combos and and didn't have much to say about any of them. 

The bottom line: Come here for the friendly, attentive service and try the chile verde and the flan."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great people. Quiet, low key, very friendly."}
{"text":"Great little \"hole in the wall\" place.  The atmosphere is laid back and inviting.  The wait staff is fantastic.  The food is authentic and fresh.  The salsa is awesome, not too much heat but if you're looking for that extra kick just ask, they've got it.  My favs are the Chilli Colorado and the Verde or The chimi with the pork carnitas.  This is a definite go to place for my family."}
{"text":"I love the fresh tortilla chips.  We all enjoyed our lunch; Guacamole for the table, beef burrito, asada burrito, cheese quesadilla, shrimp tacos and Camarones Al Moja De Ajo (hold the chimp).  Rio has a relaxed atmosphere and the service was good."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Food was great! Also had the fried ice cream and it was very good. Service was good but not great. My server didn't seem happy to be working and was quick to get me out of there. Otherwise, she was prompt and didn't mess up my order. My wife wants to come back."}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be the last.  This place is great! Services was excellent and the food was awesome! I love chile rellenos and theirs were fresh and amazing! You have to try the guacamole! The margaritas were good too. You should try this place if you haven't been before!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican Restaurant! Great family owned restaurant with awesome service and DELICIOUS food! We usually opt for the chimichangas enchilada style, but lately I've been digging the chipotle shrimp. The kids love the large quesadilla and chips and salsa. The salsa has a good kick to it, which I love but if you're not a huge fan of spicy ask them for Mild salsa. Whenever we have guests from out of town this is our go to place. Drinks are delicious too! Ambiance is great with a very welcoming feel. Locally owned and operated!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food. Hard to find a good chili verde. Margaritas  were good."}
{"text":"Cute little Mexican place! GREAT prices, and great food! Staff was so pleasant and helped us right away. Took our order and put it in on their cell phones so it went in right away (neat!) and had our guacamole app out in less than 3 minutes! Guac was delicious, so fresh and tasty. Had beef fajitas and for the price they gave you SO MUCH FOOD!! I absolutely love that they do red, yellow, and green peppers, adds such a lovely color mix to the presentation! Perfectly grilled with enough char for taste but not too much that it was overpowering! Beer was tasty, a little well done, could've been cooked a tad less but for $12 I really can not complain. Overall, I wouldn't say the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life, but it was delicious and a great deal for the price."}
{"text":"OMG the salsa is fantastic. Service is quick an friendly and the food is worth coming back for.  Big thumbs up"}
{"text":"I love a family ran establishment, ran by such a sweet family where it is apprarent that they love and take pride in what they do! Gabby one of the family members/co-owners took great care of our table. I asked her what her recommendation was since it was my first visit. She recommended the Chipoltle Shrimp dish(which you can also get with chicken), came with cooked to perfection rice and beans. The sauce was spicy and full of flavor, had mushrooms which I thought was unusual but the taste was amazing. Once my daughter and her dude tried the sauce they ordered a side of it to dip their food in. They are regulars that come at least once every few weeks and now I can see why. I can hardly wait to return to try their crab enchiladas, my daughter's favorite and hopefully save room to try dessert. This is definitely the place to go for authentic and great mexican food with fabulous service!"}
{"text":"I am very sad to see such bad reviews for such wonderful and lovingly prepared food. The restaurant is very clean and the food is always fresh. I love the green chili omelet, the Chile Rolleno is exceptional, and the shrimp dish with vegetables (it is not spicy like the diablo--hmm like the devil). When they offer happy hour priced drinks they really are a great value. We try to support family owned businesses in Gilbert. Yes, the service is slow, so avoid the typically peak dining hours."}
{"text":"Family owned business. Authentic Mexican food. Best guacamole in town! Nothing compares to their chili releno. Mario makes an amazing Bloody Mary too! Highly recommend!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love horchata.  This establishment makes some of the best horchata I've ever had.  It was homemade and delicious.  The service staff was very attentive and polite.  I ordered the camarones al mojo de ajo (Shrimp grilled in garlic/butter sauce).  It arrived with a side of beans and rice.  I cannot express how much I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  I had well over a dozen large shrimp sautéed with onion and bell peppers, all served with hot tortillas.  I ate everything.  My friends ordered traditional margaritas, which they also enjoyed.  I would come here again and again.  The owners--originally from Santa Ana, California--have a gold mine in this place.  Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"From the service to the food to the made-from-scratch margaritas, this is our go-to spot for Mexican food. Don't be fooled by the lackluster appearance, this place is worth visiting again and again. I recommend the carne asada, carnitas, or mole. Delish."}
{"text":"Fresh homemade tortillas...melt in your mouth. Had combo fajitas, very tasty. Owned by Mother & son and the mother was my waitress and she is very sweet and works hard. highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good good in a small casual dinning environment,  service struggles and can't quite seem to figure out what's going on even after close to a decade in business.  the food tastes fresh and is served hot when you get it.  if I could just get over the fact that they share a building with a veterinary animal clinic!  Who thinks of this stuff?   They should change there logo to either way your pet comes home with you.  Or maybe it warmed your heart now your stomach"}
{"text":"Great service and their Chili Colorado is a must. Enjoy a margarita as well. Very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and good prices. My kids thank you for the fried ice cream"}
{"text":"We just went here and stood at the front near the \"Please Wait To Be Seated\" sign. They were very busy so we expected a little wait. But we stood there for almost ten minutes and no one even acknowledged our presence. Six or seven employees saw us and totally ignored us.  We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time over the weekend upon a friends recommendation and just the fact the this has been here for so long and we'd never tried it. The place smelled strongly of cleaning chemicals, which was a little off-putting at first. On the other hand, at least we knew it was clean :) The atmosphere is about the same as when this was Guedo's, so nothing to complain about there. The food was decent, but I wouldn't say I was blown away by it. The Chile Relleno was fine: I've had better and I've had worse. The carne asada tacos were good. The salsa was very good: just the right amount of heat. All in all, I would return and try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic, as always!  Service, food, greeting - always A+.  This family owned gem is the best Mexican in AZ!"}
{"text":"This place is close to home, so I really wanted to like it Over the years I have eaten here a few times. It is one of those places where you have to try it once every couple of years in hopes that it had improved. Nice people there, and good service. The issue is the food. My wife and I each ordered a combo of tacos, rice and beans, and burrito rice and beans. I ended up taking 3 bites and throwing it away. My wife liked hers for about 4 bites. The food is low quality. I must say the salsa is good as it actually is somewhat spicy. The food is on par with Filibertos. It seems like a decent place to have a few drinks, just stay away from most of the food."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Easy to order. The food was delicious. Will definitely be trying them again."}
{"text":"We really appreciate successful family run restaurants and this is one of them. They were very friendly, accommodated special orders and you could tell they were making the food to order and not just re-heating pre-made food in the back.y husbAnd thought the carne asada was flavorful. Chicken in Mexican restaurants sometimes seems like it's made with whatever meat is leftover but this appeared to be all white meat chicken, not dry or flavorless. This was our first visit. We will be back and I'll be willing to try something more unique now that I trust their kitchen."}
{"text":"I love this place! Nothing fancy, just good food and great service. Also, I have never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! I ordered through the Yelp \"order online\" option for pickup. I ordered a Mole dinner, cheese enchilada dinner, chicken enchilada kids plate, and a guacamole appetizer. When we arrived to the reataurant to pick up order they said they were out of Mole and suggested pork carnitas. They said they tried to call my phone number but didn't get a hold of anyone, although I double checked my order status and it showed the correct phone number. My advice is to call and speak to the actual restaurant attendant to be sure the food you want is available. (I really craved Mole and looked forward to it.) Also check your order containers to be sure you have the correct order. Very tasty food, though."}
{"text":"Great food.  Family dining. Good service and price."}
{"text":"Went with family last nite again.  Reduced my rating by two stars due to a few things that irked me.  1)  Made reservations but when we got there, they did not have table reserved for us.  So they put two tables together to accomodate my party -- one table had wobbly legs and was unevenly matched to the other table.  2)  Then they screwed up our drink order  -- got the plain and frozen strawberry margaritas reversed.  Also got the cadillac margarita without salt reversed with the regular one with salt.  3) Forgot to serve one of our appetizers. 4) and lastly, one drink arrived after we had finished eating.  No offer to exchange the drinks to make them right, and no comp from the bill as a token of apology --- did not expect them to take a meal off, but they could have at least taken one drink or one appetizer off the bill."}
{"text":"Service could be much better but, the food is good and affordable and across the street from my house.  Their green chile pork is pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"Went with the entertainment coupon- buy one dinner, get one free.  It took $8 off our bill.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer.  The guacamole was very good but you get a very small portion size for $4 and I wouldn't order it again.

My husband and son had the Chili Colorado since it was gluten free.  The liked it and my son even said the beans weren't bad.  He is not a fan of bean. 

My one daughter who never gets excited about food raved about the chicken taco.

I really enjoyed the cheese enchilada and the beans.  I didn't finish the chili relleno,  it was very blah... to egg tasting.

We won't go back only because it is way to far from home for us."}
{"text":"Best green chili pork burrito I've tasted, and tasted, and tasted!! I find that this dish is a weekly crave! Family operated and great atmosphere. Gets crowded during peek hours."}
{"text":"Place is always busy but take that as a good thing! Food was delicious! I recommend the carne asada. Beans were awesome too!"}
{"text":"I really liked this little place.  Kind of off the main intersection, so you have to notice it is there.  The feeling inside was quite homey and comfortable.  No loud music to where you would have to yell across the table.  The food was very good for both me and my husband.  I would certainly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was great.  Very friendly and accommodating.  The salsa was bland but Chicken flauta was delish! The atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great... only complaint is that the catering order was 30-45 mins behind schedule. Recommend cushioning time for big orders. Eating in was a much better experience, service staff was nice, and attentive."}
{"text":"I found this place a few weeks ago. My wife and I stopped in for lunch. We were both so excited to find a place with such good salsa and customer service under the same roof.  I liked it so much I had my company Christmas party there last night.  We had 23 guests and the service was amazing.  We were all talking about how well they took care of us. The food all came out hot and fresh.  I highly recommend this place.  I'll tell all my friends.  My new spot for Mexican food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! We are always very well taken care of. We love their chicken taquitos & shrimp with chipotle sauce"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on Tuesday night. It came highly recommended from my director so I was excited. We went around 5:30 so the place wasn't packed yet. We were seated immediately. I liked the chips & salsa but Nichole didn't. She thought it was bland & flavorless (she's the Mexican so she should know). She had the green chilli burrito while I ordered the chipotle shrimp. Nichole didn't like the burrito. She said it was like green chilli pork out the can (I liked it but then again, I'm black). My chipotle shrimp were pretty good. Jumbo shrimp cooked in chipotle sauce with rice & beans. I'll agree with Nichole here; the rice & beans needed salt & some love. I liked the food but will I drive from Chandler JUST to eat here? Probably not."}
{"text":"Have been a regular since they opened.  This is a family owned and run restaurant and they are friendly, the food is always good.  I stick to my usual order but have had many friends and family try other dishes with no complaints. Service is good; I never had to wait for a table on a weeknight.

I can get a full meal for two with fountain drinks and chips, etc for about $17.  i can order a couple of margaritas and leave for under $30."}
{"text":"Yes. You will enjoy yourself if you enjoy he following:

Nice people, great food, free chips and salsa that tastes amazing.  Good prices.

This place is great, I have been here twice, and we live nowhere near this place, but I found myself within 15 minutes so I came here for a quick lunch.  I had the Camarones  A la Diabla"}
{"text":"$4.95 for 2oz guac in to go order, pretty lame. Easy pick up, easy ordering online via eat24 interface on Yelp. Decent burritos, nothing fancy or outstanding. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here once. Doesn't shine but doesn't make me advise to never try. I personally went since we had a coupon and were feeding 5. With a coupon it may be fine but for the better tasting food this isn't the place.

The staff were very friendly but that was the highlight of our meal. Even the Mojito was barely good at best.

I'll be trying another local business in the future, but may be back for a second chance. They didn't completely drive me away..."}
{"text":"Usually I don't take a 10-year-old's recommendation on a restaurant but this kid was right. So far, I've dropped in for 3 meals and I've brought my dad here for his birthday party. Not once did I have a complaint and neither did anybody else. The servers are phenomenal, super happy and super helpful. They haven't messed up on any of our orders either, something easy to do when you have a party of 12. The food's been pretty dang fantastic, I must say. This place has really grown on me, I didn't see this one coming. For Mexican food this is a great choice. Awesome service, not a long wait time for food, delicious food and extremely reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout here several times. I would have to wait a little longer than anticipated to pick up the food because they're so busy.if they tell you 20 minutes it will be 30 minutes. The food is very very good. I've gotten almost everything they have on the menu and it's always fantastic."}
{"text":"Always fantastic service and great food. This is top of the list when we want Mexican."}
{"text":"This was actually a ptetty good mexican restaurant. It seemed like nothing impressive when you walked in, but the salsa was pretty good and I enjoyed their chicken burrito their chicken tacos are very good though especially smothered with salsa. But my husband is very picky on mexican food and said it's some of the most authentic mexican food he's had. He loved the carne asada tacos. He had to go back for more a couple days later lol. Friendly staff, seemed like a family owned place."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the east valley!!
The service is great. 
They just moved to bigger and also nicer location. 
I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We really like this small family owned and operated place. Good food, good service, nice atmosphere. We have like everything we have tried here and we really like the cheese enchiladas. This is a nice place for a quiet lunch."}
{"text":"Have not been here for years and was delighted to see they have not changed. Great food and service. Had the green chile verde and the sauce is fantastic!! Way to keep up the great food Rio Rico!"}
{"text":"Very nice family run restaurant food is very good. Chips and salsa are always good too. They are no longer a Gilber secret always busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Bland, boring, terrible Mexican food... But hey, at least the customer service was good.

The salsa and margaritas were the only redeeming quality.  And it's hard to screw up salsa and margaritas.

We had the combo appetizer (quesadilla, chicken taquitos, potato skins stuffed w red/green chili, and nachos) and the chicken and steak fajitas.  The quesadilla was very greasy and it was the first time our kids called quesadilla \"gross.\"  The nachos were just greasy cheese and beans.  Boring, bland and very greasy.  The potato skins were obviously reheated.  Also very bland and boring. 

I've never had a place mess up fajitas, but somehow they did it.  I keep saying the word \"bland\" in my review because its the best way to describe my experience here.  The meat was so flavorless and when you're not using a high quality cut of meat, everyone knows seasoning is pivotal.  Terrible!   

If this place could get a new head chef and menu and keep the great customer service, they could be OK."}
{"text":"In my opinion, better than the chain restaurants. This intimate, family owned business is exceptional. It's located right on Val Vista but set back from the road so look carefully, you could miss it if you don't know it's there. Really friendly and personal service. The Chile Verde is my Wife's \"must have\" but I would highly recommend La Grande, a little of everything that adds up to a LOT of satisfying Mexican food. The chile rellenos are the best I've had anywhere. I honestly can't find anything we don't like!

If you're a local you probably already know about Rio Rico but if you're a tourist you should definitely make the effort to find this place, you'll be really glad you did."}
{"text":"We never ventured into this place because it is attached to a veterinary clinic,  BIG MISTAKE. If only we knew what we had been missing.   I'm a super stickler for cleanliness and I just couldn't get past it. Alas, we met a relative of the owners who told us we just had to try it and she was so right.  We were seated within 5 minutes of entering the door. Drinks and chips were on our table immediately. The salsa was just the right amount of spice and not overpowered with cilantro (I hate cilantro and thus I get very picky about salsa).  We had to wait about 5 min to order which would give the average customer time to look over the menu. We happened to have gotten recommendations on what to eat before going so we already knew what we wanted. Within 5-7 min the food was on our table, served on hot plates and the food was hot.  My husband had carmones chipotle (sorry if I spelled it wrong but it's shrimp with a chipotle sauce). He was immediately in love.  He completely cleaned his plate which isn't something he normally does.  He couldn't stop eating.  I'm a light eater and I ordered 2 beef soft tacos and rice.  I took half the rice and a taco home,  I was so filled up on the delish chips and salsa I couldn't eat all my meal. We also had a house margarita which was quite tasty and definitely had a healthy amount of alcohol in it. Next time I will try chicken or shredded beef instead of the ground beef to see which I like better. And I will branch out to some combo platters which I don't do until I know I like a place.  My husband says he will order the same thing! They have a nice patio set up and the inside is typical Mexican restaurant decor,  several different colors of paint on the walls that go together nicely. A cute little bar area where they mix up goodness.  We asked about the crabs on the walls and found out the owner was a crab fisherman in Alaska.  Gabby was our server and was really pleasant and answered all our questions."}
{"text":"As a Californian, looking for good Mexican food I have been disappointed in Arizona. Enter Rio Rico. The owners are from Cali and know what I want, homemade delicious food. The service was fantastic. Very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Crunchy tacos are bomb
Service is fast
Good guacamole, its freshly made
Resturant is clean and spaciouse"}
{"text":"Came to this place because our friends' family insisted we visit - it was our first trip ever to AZ. 

I ordered the chilaquiles, which consist of crispy tortilla chips, scrambled eggs, tomato sauce + salsa, and some veggies. The chilaquiles weren't as red in color as I thought they would be, which was unfortunate because this dish revolves around the tomato sauce and salsa. It was also missing fresh cheese, non-melted - a big ingredient to add where I'm from in MX. It was a little lacking, but at least the tortilla chips weren't soggy. It also came with red rice and refried beans, and that was delicious! Those were very authentic. 

Parking is plentiful. Service was a bit slow. We waited practically an hour for our food on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't really that busy. We were a rather large party, but they still weren't really on top of chips, salsa, and our drinks. 

I would come back, but perhaps not by choice."}
{"text":"Super delicious! The green chilli verde was perfect and the pork was tender. The food came out on time. We ordered out, but next time I will dine in so I can try one of their tasty looking margaritas! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about this place so I had to try it for myself.

I was greeted by Mario who seated me right away and took my drink order. I started with the salsa,  my taste buds went crazy.  It's the best salsa I've ever tasted then I dive into the guacamole and it's tasty as hell too.

I ordered the Cadillac Margarita and it was delicious and that's saying alot, because those who know me know I'm a Margarita snob. I will definitely be back to try the food. Impressive little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Hands down the best and most authentic Mexican food in the east valley.  Family run incredible restaurant.   The passion comes out with every order.  Best chili verde ever.  They will put it in the lunch enchiladas no problem.   Great lunch specials, cold beer and great service.  What more could a girl ask for???    Super clean and totally accommodating"}
{"text":"1st time here, service was kind of slow but food was excellent!"}
{"text":"As a big fan of ambience, I was a bit disappointed when we first walked in. However, that quickly disappeared. While the table arrangement was plain and decor not fancy, the overall feeling was warm, friendly, and cozy.  It's a small restaurant and quickly filled up.  

Service was excellent!  Not only were our servers attentive, but I was able to make my own combo plate that  was not shown on the menu. 

We began with some of the best guacamole all four of us had ever had.  For almost $5, it was a smaller portion than expected, but so good we were fighting to lick the last bits from the tortilla shell.  

The tamale (my favorite dish) gets a 5-star rating.  Moist, flavorful, and with a delicious green sauce, it was gone much too quickly.  Should have ordered two.  The server said that the restaurant was known for its guacamole (we agree) and chiles rellenos, which my husband ordered, along with an enchilada. Since he's Mr. Picky, I wondered how it would rate, but at the end of the meal he told the server that this was now his favorite Mexican restaurant.   

Our friends ordered a fajita mix (good-sized serving) and a combo plate that included a real crab enchilada.  We had planned on trying the deep-fried ice-cream or the flan, but no one had an inch of tummy room left.  

Prices are average for a Mexican restaurant in this area -- $7.95-$13.00 for dinner, less for lunch.  Rio Rico offers a good list of seafood entrees and is open for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great friendly service! Authentic and truly delicious! I felt like I was at one of my relatives homes with one of my aunties in the kitchen. The atmosphere was clean, warm & inviting. Our new family favorite for sure! Thank you Rio Rico, we also love the fact that you are family owned & operated! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, I'm a native to AZ have been back for 1 1/2 years but I haven't found a Mexican restaurant that I love, and that I remember as a kid, until now.  Excellent!! Great salsa, margaritas and perfect blend of heat and spices. Authentic Mexican the way it should be. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Had a taste for Mexican food and this place definitely satisfied that craving. The staff were helpful and the place was clean. My kids ordered the grilled cheese and cheese quesadilla and they ate the whole thing! The complimentary chips and salsa were very tasty as well, and my son just couldn't stop eating it. Will definitely come back here again:)"}
{"text":"Had to come back again! Love that we found this place. The service is amazing, and they are so friendly. Can't wait until my family visits so I can take them. Found our new Mexican spot."}
{"text":"OK, we're very picky about restaurants, especially Mexican restaurants.  This one is awesome!  The facility is clean and cheerful in appearance, and the food and service are top notch.  The enchiladas are as good or better than at other favorite Mexican restaurants, and the tostada was the best we've ever had anywhere.  Beans were perfectly cooked, and the salsa was great.  We will definitely be back....many times!"}
{"text":"Rio Rico is kind of a glorified taco stand. And I usually LOVE taco stands. Only Rico's has the prices of a fancy-smancy sit down restaurant. In Scottsdale. They had a cute patio but it smelled like the car exhast from the nearby AmPm. Our carne asada tacos were pretty tasty, but nothing to brag about. I'll stick to Guedo's or Elmer's."}
{"text":"When you see 3 stars, just know that it's not because of the food. The food was awesome. Actually some of the best Mexican I've had. The service is not good though. We sat outside (which isn't a big deal). We were the only ones and that was nice. They then brought out a large party (also not a big deal). The problem was when they say them right next to us. There were 10 (not exaggerating) open tables.  Our quiet nice evening turned into loud people who stared at us along with loud burping. My water glass was empty twice and was only refilled when I asked.  We waited forever for our check. This was because no one came out to check on us. We saw an employee when we ordered, when we got our food, and when they brought the check. That's all. I will give it another shot sometime to see if this was a fluke or if it's normal. If it's normal, this will be a take out only restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we went to a different Mexican restaurant initially only to find out they were closed on Sunday's. We quickly found Rio Rico on Yelp. I was already irritated because of the other restaurant being closed and my kids whining in the backseat. 

When we arrived at Rio Rico 3 other vehicles pulled in right behind us. Our waiter was very pleasant and had a good demeanor with a smile on his face. The chips and salsa were good and our meals were excellent. I had a tamale which was the best one I had eaten in years. Visiting Rio Rico turned my mood around when it very easily could've gone the other direction. I felt compelled to write a good review for them. 

I started my review before leaving the restaurant while my wife and kids were using the restroom. The kids then wanted to use some coins they earned for chores/good behavior in the candy machines at the front before leaving. I forgot to grab my sons hat. While leaving, our waiter ran out to our car to deliver the hat and leftovers before we left. Again, thanks a bunch Rio Rico. I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for good Mexican food and in the area."}
{"text":"Asked for burrito without cheese.....Got Cheese!  Waited 30 minutes for drink refills.  Had to ask for more chips.  Horrible wait staff!  Off our list!"}
{"text":"This place was ok.  Very basic, bare bones, authentic type Mexican restaurant.  Good chips and salsa.  We each had two margaritas.  The first ones took a long time to get to us, but they were good.  The second ones were soooooo stong!  We could hardly drink them....tasted like pure tequila!  I like me a strong margarita, but wow!  I had the Chili Relleno.  Good but extra greasy.  BF got the steak fajitas which he loved!  Our server was really friendly though and the prices are very reasonable.  I'm sure we'll go back."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss, Mario is really friendly and attentive. Best salsa, love it!!! They have really good beef tacos(homestyle) and a chicken soup that's delish as well. They habe good chips and rice too."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting, and I was pleasantly surprised. My husband and kids had come in before and liked it, so I gave it a shot. The outside of the restaurant is very nondescript, but they make it nice inside. The food was quite good: their salsa has a bit of a kick, and the chips were good. I sampled two different types of meat, and preferred the shredded beef over the chicken, but there was nothing wrong with the chicken. My son had the carne asada which was very tasty. What really sold me on the place was the attentive service we had from two  friendly employees. It was just the classic case of people who care that you are spending money in their establishment, so they treat you kindly and respectfully. Drinks were refilled and we were checked on regularly. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"True Mexican Food.
Rich with flavor & a bit on the spicy side.
Shrimp Cocktail was awesome"}
{"text":"Good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood of Mesa. Great food. Good taste. Super clean place. Lots of parking space. Modern clean cantina. Good service. Super friendly servers. I highly recommend it. It's your call to look for it and try it."}
{"text":"Got take out recently. This review gets a +1 Benefit-of the-Doubt Star. Pure rating is 2 Stars.

Not certain what I was expecting but the service seemed impersonal and in general weird.

My tacos were OK. By appearance my wife's enchiladas were less than OK, as only a third of one enchilada was eaten.

With hopes of a better experience, I'll try again in a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"I've been many times.  The service and food are always great!  They are always willing to customize the order.  Their margaritas are quite good (I am a bit of a connoisseur).  Second only to Los Picos Parilla in Mesa.  My Phoenix raised husband is always pleased with their \"HOT\" salsa (you have to request) and was pleasantly surprised with their crab enchilada."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa.  Their guacamole is awesome too.  Very reasonable prices, large portions, and friendly waitstaff.  It has the feel of a small Mexican joint in a little city, that is run by family.  The margaritas are perfect, nice and strong.  My favorite dish is the shrimp/chicken/steak fajitas. We try and come here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a little sit down Mexy food. I had the Grande combination ... a cheese enchilada, and huge chile relleno and a delicious shredded beef taco... Rice and beans adequate... good service! I'd go back in a heartbeat! Too bad I'm leaving AZ...."}
{"text":"The establishment was really nice looking and inviting with a full bar and bar seating. I just had a quick to go order, and they made sure I had a huge bag of chips and guacamole with my order. It was done extremely quickly as well."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not great. Waitress put us in the back and forgot about us. I had to go find her to get water. Then had to go find her to order. Then had to go find her to get the check."}
{"text":"Very good food, their guacamole is very tasty, service is good, water is excellent (no joke!). We visit regularly :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great margaritas and fajitas. I've only been there in the summer and it tends to be a little warm in the dining area. If not for that, I'd definitely give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is great and the service is good too! We are excited that they are moving to a larger location!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for about 10 years now and it has only gotten better!  Mario always takes time to visit with us and now that they have become wireless the service is very good plus they now have a full time bartender so that eliminates having to wait for one of their tasty Cadillac Margaritas.  The Chipotle Shrimp is our favorite but their Green Chili Pork is quite tasty too!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good. You can't go wrong with the tamales or combo plates and the service is always fast."}
{"text":"I too am very surprised to see all the glowing reviews for Rio Rico. The best thing about our meal was the guacamole, which was tasty, chunky, and fresh. Everything else, including the beans, was watery, bland, greasy, and not good. We did not try the seafood, which is supposed to be delicious, so maybe we ordered the wrong things. But the mole and the enchiladas were terrible. After eating here once, we can't bring ourselves to return to try the seafood. We can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday because of the amazing reviews.  The food wasn't terrible but the waitress was awful.  She got the order wrong after she even repeated it, I ordered beef and she gave me chicken.  We had ordered two cokes, a diet Coke and a Dr Pepper and she didn't have them marked at all so she ended up giving all of us the wrong drinks.  She never came to check on us or refill our drinks.  We finally got her attention and asked for refills and she never came back, we could see her just standing at the register talking and playing in her phone.  She acted like we were inconveniencing her by even being there.  Needless to say, we will not be back.  I am giving two stars because although the service was one of the worst I've experienced, the food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Ya..this place is nothing to write home about. Very small place. No music, strangely quiet. The guacamole,chips and salsa were  amazing but the rest of the food was rather bad. I had the Shrimp Enchiladas and they came out with some kind of sauce not resembling enchilada sauce at all. The shrimp was fishy and the rice and beans were bland. Maybe I should give it a second chance before I write it off all together."}
{"text":"Like the food but horrible service it was slow they messed up orders ,no refills and rude so definitely not a great experience! Not worth going back"}
{"text":"So, we used to go here all the time because it was my absolute favorite Mexican place to eat in town. Last time we were there (at their new location) I ordered my usual, Chipotle Chicken. Within 10 minutes of eating, I was in the bathroom throwing everything up. It was such an awful experience. The chicken was extremely chewy which is a sign of frozen chicken being cooked. Our server insisted on making me another to go and took it off of our bill which I totally appreciated but the thought of eating my to go food made me feel sick to my stomach. Not sure why I got so sick from the chicken. Note to Rio Rico: You were the best in town! Please check on your kitchen staff and making sure the chicken is 100% thawed out before cooking. We will for sure be back after that happens. :)"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Had the tamale and chili rellano combo plate.  The chili rellano had a heavy breading and not crispy but was still very good.  Will be coming back the next time we're in AZ."}
{"text":"Welcoming and attentive staff. Maria, the host was sweet and friendly. Got the shrimp fajitas and it was delicious. Highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"Generous servings, nicely flavored and reasonably priced lunch. I would happily return to try another dish."}
{"text":"Rice was bland, the salsa boring (their table salsa) refrieds were okay. I would give actually 2.5 stars overall. Service was good. Environment slightly leans more \"TACO STAND\" it would be a toss of a coin as to my return. Victor was great! Ordered ranchero tacos was suppose to be strips but was small cubes of meat very tough and chewy. Brought the one described - was tender but oily and lacked taste."}
{"text":"We used to live really close to this place and ordered take out from them regularly, but forgot about them when we moved. We decided to stop by and check it out again recently and were reminded of why we used to come often. Mostly, we came because it was close and convenient. The food was good, but not blow your socks off great. The service was also a bit slow, but they were trying hard. It was a full house and it's possible they were short handed that evening. Don't get me wrong, I would recommend trying them out. It's one of the better Mexican places in the area. But living where we live makes us all a somewhat harsh critic of Sonoran Mexican food, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food.  Service was a tad slow but it was crazy busy for Cinco de Mayo, so no harm.  Best guacamole I've ever had and the salsa was awesome! No complaints whatsoever!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Took my family here & everyone loved it. I was initially leery about eating at a restaurant that's right next door to an animal clinic but I was shocked at the great food here. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good experience here. Went with my roommates & ate way too much. The enchiladas are wonderful. The chimis are good. And apparently the margaritas are great. Free chips and salsa which were pretty basic, but overall good."}
{"text":"Don't believe the bad reviews. This place is a great little Mexican restaurant. Good food, good margaritas and a great staff."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I have been here 3 times with my husband.  We order something different every time.  So far, we have loved everything.  The help is friendly and the food is amazing.  Also, their fresh made margs are really tasty.  I'm definitely becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Food is really good. The camarones a la diabla is AWESOME. It's probably the spiciest thing I've ever had at a restaurant  (they warn you), and the flavor is great. A little small on the seating, but it's a solid Mexican spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We have been visiting Rio Rico for quite some time.  ALWAYS, the food is great - both taste and portions - as well as the staff (mostly family, I believe) being very prompt and attentive.  No matter how busy, Mario always seems to find time to stop by the table and greet each patron.

My normal meal is either the Crab Enchilada or Camarones al Chipotle - though I have strayed to others!  I think I started the \"Fishbowl Margarita\", which I always order!

Definitely, if you would like a really good meal, visit Rio Rico - Val Vista and Guadelupe in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"This has to be hands down my favorite Mexican place around here. 
Service is exceptional! 
Everything we have ordered is delicious, great size plates, very reasonable prices and awesome margaritas.
This is the perfect family/kid restaurant. 
My kids loooove it here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and wow the food was amazing. Seems like family run business. Servers were so young. It was refreshing to see them catering to the youth and showing them a great work ethic as well as having impeccable speed on getting all the food out. Phenomenal. You must check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"WOW! We absolutely love this place! I've had a gift card for this place for 2 years now and hadn't used it. We pulled up in the lot (behind a gas station and next to a Vet office) and it looked empty, so we turned out noses up and left and went to Serrano's instead up the street. BIG FRIGGIN' MISTAKE as we found out 2 years later. 

The food in this place is outrageously good and authentic. My wife is Hispanic from New Mexico and she was speechless about the food. 

What caught my eye first was the picture of the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail on the back menu cover - no doubt to order that baby up and it didn't disappoint whatsoever - just the right amount of heat and flavor. Superb. Now I've ordered this twice. Both times the flavor was consistent. The first time it lacked a bit on the shrimp volume from what I would expect but the 2nd time it was full of them. 

We also ordered the appetizer platter. We usually liek to order this as it sampel many of the featured appetizers. Many times, in Mex Restaurants, this comes out/tasting rather generic looking. This plate was the real McCoy. Everything was authentic and home-made; nothing boxed here. The most unusual aspect were the potato skins. Fresh potatoes hollowed out and filled with...ready...one with home-made red chili beef and the other with green chili pork. My eyes nearly popped out and the taste buds validated it. 

Whenever I go to a new joint, I always ask what the best thing on the menu is and on this occasion I was told, \"Well, the best thing actually isn't on the menu. It's a special order chipotle cream shrimp dish.\" I felt like I snuck into a foodie speak-easy...sign me up for that one! Big fat plump prawns in a zesty cream sauce - this is now on the monthly rotation; hands down. No rice, sub-veggie, along with re-fried cheesy beans completed the plate. Veggies were a surprise of fajita veg mixed with peas and mushrooms - awesome!

My wife raved about the home made sopapillas too and can't wait to bring her mother to this place. 

Here's the knock and most likely why this place isn't burning busy with customers - the service is bad - consistently bad. You're either waiting un-godly amounts of time, or being inundated with courses. The first time we went was on a Tuesday I believe. Place was a bit busy but certainly not off the rails - but the staff was. They were truly in \"the weeds.\" Took forever to order and forever + eternity to get a bar drink. I wised up the next time and ordered 2 beers instead of one ($2 Negro Modelos - yes that isn't a typo). Issue here was it was a school night and our 9 year old was with us and teh Sloooooooooooowww service was know making a time pinch as there's school tomorrow. It was painful HOWEVER the owner Mario is so charmingly nice, and with the food being so good, it warranted a repeat attendance. 

The 2nd time was the opposite. The waitress took our order and I specifically said I wanted the Mex Shrimp cocktail first, then we would like the app platter before the meal. You guessed it - EVERYTHING on the table within 5 minutes of each other. 3 dinner plates and 2 appetizers along with chips and salsa. Inundated table. 

Hopefully Mario can address the service issues. If he does, this restaurant would definitly run off the charts. My other suggestion would be to add Sunday Mariachis. We'd be there every week if they did."}
{"text":"Tf. How does this have such good reviews

Walk in, lady tries to sit us by the busy counter and we say no, she moves us to a bigger table and gives us a high chair for our son. I don't think she ever spoke to us? Either way, she was annoyed that we didn't like her first table option and we could tell.. She hands us some grimy menus and leaves. 

My son was screaming crying at this time and I was really relying on our chips and salsa to come but IT DIDNT. After like 15 minutes of no service, I flagged a lady down and she was out of breath and threw some chips on the table. Uhhhh k

Then she took our drink orders after being there like a half hour (we only wanted some WATERS) and we told her we were ready to order food. Ordered La Mediana (taco + cheese enchilada) and two ground beef enchiladas with rice n beans. Legit took 1 min and our food was at the table. Kinda left wondering how it was ready soooo fast..... but yeahhhhh

It was nasty. The red enchilada sauce was black, burnt af and tasted like shit. I took the ground beef out of the tortillas/sauce and my son and I just ate meat with rice n beans. My husband ate his taco and said it was good, but didn't eat his nasty enchilada either..

I cannot express how gross the food was and how poor the service was. They threw the check on our table and basically ran. A lot of regulars must give them business and good Yelp reviews because I would NEVER come here again. When we move to AZ, I'm going to have to find another good Mexican restaurant because this is NOT it!!!"}
{"text":"Rio Rico's is our every Monday hangout for softball.  I grew up in Tucson, and definitely know what good Mexican food is.  Rio Rico is not the best that I have ever had, but it is definitely good!  
It is always nice to see the people that run the restaurant taking personal interest in how their food is.   I say give it a shot, Maria is always willing to bring you a cold one!"}
{"text":"Well, the food smelled good! I just walked in to dine by myself, and was treated terribly. It was hands down, the worst customer service I received. The waitress asked how many, and seemed extremely annoyed I was by myself. Then she asked \"what to you want to drink\", before I even opened my menu! So mean. I spoke with the manager and left. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"We ended up here because the usual Mexican restaurant we go to had a wait in excess of an hour. It's not very easy to find and when we walked in it was only 1/2 full. This is usually a bad sign. But the Yelp reviews where good and it was worth rolling the dice. 
The salsa was very good. Some people might think it is to hot, but it was good for my wife and myself. The guacamole was even better than that. 
We both ordered a combo plate. I just wanted to see how other items on their menu tasted. The chili rlleno  was very good and the enchilad and taco were pretty average. 
The server was very nice, but there seem to be understaffed because I had to get my own water after I ran out. I'm not at all patient, so I had to help myself."}
{"text":"Great little place for dinner. 
Service started out horrible, but after being seated Gabby our waitress turned that around. She was nice and truly cared about her job. 
Food was delicious! The burritos were stuffed with all ingredients ordered, not just the typical rice & beans. There was plenty of steak.
Price for 2 people was $22. Not bad for both of us getting full combo meals. 
I will most defiantly return."}
{"text":"This place seems to be a family owned restaurant and although the staff was sweet the food just didn't taste as great as expected. The guacamole taste like avocado with barley any hint of lime or salt. I will say the food came out piping hot which I LOVED but overall the service was really slow for my expectation. Probably wouldn't come here again as there are way better Mexican restaurants elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by a relative.  We all think we know about Mexican food so we constantly share new places that we find.  I took my entire family here and we all loved what we ordered.  The food was so tasty.  They make the  guacamole to order, it was great!  The atmosphere was very pleasant.  Not fancy, just a nice homey place.  Real good homemade dishes and great value for the money.  Today I am taking my old friend here because I am craving some delicious Mexican food.  Can't wait to get there."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Gilbert. The food is great, the staff is friendly and the margaritas are the best!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit made me realize how we had totally missed this great place. We were seated quickly and the wait staff were friendly, efficient and quick.  Our drinks, chips and salsa came within minutes of being seated while we looked over the menu.
We ordered and our meals came quickly and steaming.  The food was fresh, hot and excellent.  Our server checked on us several times and refilled drinks when needed and when we finished she was there to clear our plates.  The check came in a timely manner.  We never felt rushed yet we did not have to sit and wait for anything.
We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Our regular Mexican restaurant was closed so we tried Rio Rico. Amazing!  Authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. This is now our new \"go to\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"They have the best guacamole! Great service, great decor! Really family atmosphere! We have found a new favorite spot! The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Their food is always delicious and tastes homemade. Guacamole is to die for and my sons absolutely love the mild salsa, which you can request.  The service can be a bit slow at times, which is why I'm not giving 5 stars. We just know not to go there if we are in a hurry."}
{"text":"YUM! Love this place every time! The guacamole is simple and has the right balance of every ingredient!  Salsa is delicious and plentiful. The enchiladas, tacos, carnitas, fried ice cream are all delicious. All fresh made. Great friendly and enthusiastic service too. We are late eaters so we've arrived around 8:30-8:40 our last 2 trips there...no problem!  Always greeted with a pleasant smile and attitude. I am not a fan of the roasted pepper salsas, kinda the New Mexican Flavors, that most of the \"Mexican\" restaurants in he East Valley offer. Rio Rico has the more simplified, yet fresh and authentic flavors we like. We'll be bringing many a friend here."}
{"text":"You know that \"off\" smell and taste your glassware had when a mouse died in your dishwasher and you didn't notice it for a few days?

Yea, I don't either but I imagine the glassware smelled and the water would taste something like the water tasted and glasses smelled here.  Ugh.  Seriously bad.  We all had to order sodas at $2 each.  They tasted off too but not as bad.  They need to look in to that.  I've had tap water in the valley and it didn't taste that bad.  If it is your tap water filter it.  Now.  I don't think it is though.  Check that out please.  Now.

The whole smelly water and glasses was so off-putting that the food would have to be unbelievably good to earn even 3 stars.

I ordered the shrimp diablo.  The shrimp was good.  Not overcooked, it was nice and tender.  The sauce was hot.  Not much else.  Just hot for the sake of hot.  It seemed like a finely blended tomato salsa with lots of jalapeno.  The rice was light and fluffy...pretty good.  The beans were forgettable.  

My wife had carne asada.  I asked how it was.  She replied \"If you write a review use the words shoe leather.\"  Ouch.  My kids picked over their food.  One of them ordered a kids enchilada with chicken.  They forgot the chicken.  Other than that it was reported as \"Not very good.  The sauce is flavorless.\"  This is a kid that knows Mexican food pretty well.

I hate to drop 1 star reviews on independent restaurants because I want the little guy to succeed but this place was just bad.  I didn't even get into the service which was passable but no more.  Get your dishwasher examined.  Now.  After you make sure there are no dead things in there run a couple cycles of bleach through that sucker.  Further, if you are serving water from the tap install a filtration system.  Now."}
{"text":"Oh my, YUM! Ceviche was light and refreshing, sampler platter was delicious and generous, and the service was warm and attentive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The \"hostess\" barely acknowledged us as she showed us to a table right next to the serving window. Seriously, 3 feet away. After waiting 15 minutes with several wait persons walking by us many times and not even making eye contact or acknowledging us, we got up and left. Had they given us water and chips with salsa or even said \"Sorry for the wait. I'll be with you in a moment\"...anything, we would of stayed. Maybe they were short staffed....I guess we will never know because no one acknowledged us. We noticed another couple walk out behind us. It's unfortunate because several years ago their food and service was great."}
{"text":"We stopped since we were at Freestone Park. I had the Chile Verde burrito and it was delicious. The salsa was also good. I liked the atmosphere. There is an outdoor patio though we sat inside.

I would go back again."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Food and Service were excellent. Get the Guacamole, worth the $4. Food is well spiced but not spicy at all. 

My wife and I came in for the first time on Sunday evening because most of our normal Mexican food spots were closed. 

The sign said please seat yourself but our server was just coming out of the kitchen and showed us to a table before we could even look around. 

He took our drink order before heading off to bring us some chips. The high quality and speedy service continued the whole visit. 

The chips were fresh and warm and the salsa was tasty but on the mild side for us. When our Guacamole arrived we were immediately pleased,  clearly made in the last 5 minutes, it was great and a good size serving.

I ordered a number 2 combo with a cheese enchilada, beef taco and chile rellano. The enchilada was extremely tasty and the taco was well spiced and served with generous amounts of very tasty white and yellow cheese. If you are a chile rellano fan you know there are 3 types, 1 is just egg wrapped, 1 is a very crispy deep fried batter and the third is a very spongy, eggy batter that is prone to get greasy. This rellano was of the latter type, but was done extremely well and wasn't greasy at all. Generously filled with cheese. If you are looking for the really crispy type of rellano, I would order something else, but it was very good if you like this type.

My wife ordered the mini chimi combo with 1 beef and 1 chicken. It was a great choice because choosing between the 2 would be really hard. They were both delicious. 

The rice was well seasoned traditional Mexican rice and the beans were niceley prepared refried beans but only very lightly mashed, preserving a great bean texture. 

Overall, excellent food for a very reasonable price. Nothing is overly spicy (we like it hot, like Los Dos Molinos hot), but everything was well spiced and flavorful. Will be on our new list of favorites."}
{"text":"This place rocks, great small family owned restaurant, their salsa is amazing, all three of them.  I love the food, so close to what we used to get in Texas.  We are regulars once a week!"}
{"text":"A friend of ours recommended Rio Ricos so we tried it tonight. Wow! Great food. I had the Chipotle cream sauce shrimp and it was amazing. Carne asada was excellent also. Very good service. Gabby was awesome. I will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Good not great
Need a better lunch menu and Taco Tuesday special 
I will go back if in the area, but won't go out of my way"}
{"text":"Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work.  Guacamole tostada is delish.   Flauta plate was also good.  Friendly staff and family owned."}
{"text":"I ordered \"take out\" from here and was impressed with the staff that took my order over the phone and how attentive they were when we got there.  At least 3 employees asked us if we had been helped.  We ordered the cheese enchiladas, rice and beans and the green chili pork burrito, rice and beans.  The green chili pork burrito was awesome!! The red cheese enchiladas were not spicy enough so none of us would order that again,  but we would order it again with the green Chile Verde sauce.  The chips and salsa were also fantastic.  I liked the beans but not so crazy about the rice.  The kids did like the beans and rice but mostly because when they sent it to go, the container actually separated the beans and rice from the enchilada and burrito.  Their complaint was that there wasn't enough beans and rice.  I will go back and try anything with green Verde Chile on it. Great food for a casual place with a nice atmosphere.  The outdoor patio would also be nice around this time of year."}
{"text":"Rio Rico is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the entirety of the East Valley. I have been going here since I was a freshman in high school (wow almost 8 years now!) and I have never had a single bad experience. The food is always absolutely exceptional, not to mention the service is some of the best I have ever seen. Mario is also the friendliest owner and genuinely cares about how his customers are doing both inside his restaurant and out. I have routinely seen him assist those with disabilities and making sure that everyone has the best dining experience possible. If more restaurants were like Rio Rico, the world would be a better place."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered from here our order was completely messed up. It took an additional 30 minutes to fix and with 2 hungry/crying kids that was not fun. I was so disappointed. Unfortunately, and I hate to be \"one of those people\" but all we got was a \"sorry\". The food itself was delicious though, so we decided to give them another try. They redeemed themselves by getting our order right (yaye) and again with their yummy food! Tacos, beans, rice, salsa, guacamole... I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food is marvelous. The guacamole and queso dip is wonderful. They'll make the horchata from scratch- usually have it everday. 
Since they've moved locations, I've updated my review to 5 stars. Their staff is friendly and their service is prompt."}
{"text":"Very pleased!

No pretense. Just honestly good food. Guacamole that isn't cluttered with stupid ingredients. Very nicely seasoned pork carnitas. Excellent, server-recommended, verde enchiladas and yummy fried ice cream.

A steady crowd kept the place jumping on a weekend night.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My orders have always been to go, I have never eaten in the restaurant. My to-go orders have always been fresh, hot and accurate. My only issue is a few times they have put the sauce over the fried chimi, resulting in a soggy chimi. The solution here is to ask for the sauce on the side :)"}
{"text":"The food here is worth coming for. I've gotten a mix of stuff, from the taquitos, tostadas, enchiladas, all have been good. My complaint...2 of the 3 times we've come we've gotten the older Hispanic lady and she totally knows how to ruin a good experience. This time I had enough & wanted to let you know that if you happen to be the unlucky patrons (as we've been in the past) you won't be waited on...at all. She couldn't even grab a high chair for us. Say other people AFTER us yet took their orders first...input in the computer and all before coming back to us.Every single person had someone go up to them & ask how things were, etc...not us. Our food stayed under the heat lamps for a solid 10 minutes before one of the cooks asked whose they were. I heard her say, in Spanish, I don't know....wtf?!? The place wasn't even busy. I think she was just in a super sour mood and lucky us we got to suffer the consequences. I talked trash about our service loud enough for other employees to hear but they didn't acknowledge us either. The more I write the more I want to say, Eff that place. I won't be back and if you're in a hurry I wouldn't recommend the place"}
{"text":"We stumbled on Rio Rico last year before they moved in search for some authentic family owned Mexican food and not a chain.....

Their new place is very clean and cozy!

Look no more! Mario and his family have a great business here. 

They always make you feel so welcome! And the food? YUM!

Nando's,Abuelo and many others are not even close in quality!

Try it! You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Not a fancy place, just a cute little strip mall restaurant.

I had the green chile burrito and my wife had the carne asada burrito. The green chile was on the spicy side...enjoy it now, but pay for it later 

The carne asada was perfect and I highly recommend it. The place seems to be family owned and the prices were reasonable. The kids that work there are cute and do a pretty good job. The beers were inexpensive during happy hour and the chips and salsa were great. 

My mark off on stars was for the sewage smell that permeated the dining room. You have to get that fixed, it will cause some customers to never come back, regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"Great place!  Was stuck in east mesa and was jonesing for some Mexican food, found this place on Yelp. Awesome customer service from the minute we walked in.  Server was quick and food was quick as well. Great flavor, we had beef tacos, and carnitas, I would definitely come here again.  I'm pretty picky with my food and this place didnt let me down. Good atmosphere and good people working here. I would have gave them a 5, but had to deduct for the tortillas not being homemade."}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail-cóctel de camarón is great.  Don't expect your American style jumbo shrimp with some cocktail sauce-no no I'm talking about Mexican style with avocado some pico de gallo and some real good hot sauce!  Yummy"}
{"text":"The first visit was awesome. The service was alright, but the food made up for it. I ordered their shredded beef soft tacos and couldn't get enough. I craved them for a few weeks until we finally went back. 
Our second visit was nothing like the first. The waitress recommended crunchy tacos, as it was a new option, so I took her up on it. We waited over an hour and a half (not an exaggeration) outside, while being ignored by our server. The restaurant was slightly busier than the last visit, but there seemed to be adequate staffing. A very large party arrived 30 minutes or so after we were seated and long forgotten. They were seated outside next to our table and tended while we were ignored longer. 
The food finally arrived and tasted awful. It was a tasteless, flavorless fried mess. The freshness of the soft corn tortillas was burnt away with the new method. 
We weren't offered an apology for the long wait and left without tipping our server. I personally didn't want to pay for the meal at all. After waiting over and hour and a half to be served a simple meal and then having it taste the way it did, we haven't been back. 
I'd like to think it was a fluke because I'd really enjoy those soft tacos again, but I've found that Filiberto's Soft Shredded beef tacos are very comparable and just as inexpensive."}
{"text":"I was invited to lunch with friends. They were buying so... I'm glad they chose this place. It's a small restaurant behind an animal hospital. They are authentic Mexican. I ordered the burrito Grande. The burrito was loaded with shredded beef and cheese, smothered in a green chili sauce. it came with a side of refried beans topped with cheese, fried rice, and lettuce, not to mention a large bowl of nacho chips and sauce.

The burrito and sides were delicious. I already know what I'm ordering next time. As I was eating, the waitress brought out a steaming, and I mean steaming hot plate of fajita. The mouth watering smell permeated the restaurant. My mouth enjoyed the burrito but my mind was anticipating the fajita. It won't be long before you see an updated review paying homage to their fajita."}
{"text":"Went to Rio Rico last night with my wife for dinner.  I had a gift card so I decided to go.  The food is actually very \"sanitized\" \"Western\" for me, but then it is expected.  I am the kind of person who is more used to going to a place that tends to be slightly more authentic.  My wife is similar.

My wife ordered a tamal and chicken enchilada.  She said is average, but unfortunately rather salty.  

Me, I ordered crab enchiladas.  It was okay, but again it was rather salty.  

I guess when it comes to Mexican and seafood, we probably should go elsewhere.  It just was not the kind of place that my wife and I would go to again.  Then again, we tend to like things are little more authentic, and that kind of push the envelope a little."}
{"text":"We are regulars to this neighborhood joint!!!! 
The margaritas are strong! 
The seafood cocktail is FULL OF SHRIMP!! 
Another favorite is the shredded beef tacos. 


It is not to be missed!!!"}
{"text":"Dr. E and I ate at Rio Rico's last night after returning from downtown Phoenix events and I wanted to update my review... First of all, this restaurant is remarkably and refreshingly free of corporate operating style people... Entering Rio Rico you are greeted by people who may not have been trained in the chain restaurants schools of management, but who are genuinely happy to see you walk into their establishment. Seating is approached like match making, based in what is right for YOU, rather than a seating distribution chart. Appetizer recommendations such as the guacamole are based on what is fresh and in-season rather than the most profitable sale. I ordered the #11 combo plate with a Chile Relleno and a Tamale, along with an Arnold Palmer to drink. Everything wad served promptly, in the right portion sizes and was muy delicioso! I highly recommend Rio Rico because it is simply the real deal... You've got to try it!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite little neighborhood Mexican food place.  Family owned and staffed.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Lots of available parking.  A couple TV's with sporting events always on.  Good chips and salsa and really tasty guacamole!  Nothing fancy but always clean, comfortable, and friendly.

My husband rates a Mexican food joint on the strength of its bean burritos and after searching far and wide, has decided this place makes one of his favorites -- which he always gets with chile verde sauce.  He also likes their chile rellenos.  Being vegetarian, I like their quesadillas and enchiladas...but when I was still a meat eating kinda gal, liked their chicken chimichangas and shrimp tacos.  

They are closed on Mondays but open every other day from 11am-9pm (8pm Sundays).  They also offer stamp cards for frequent diners -- pick one up, rack up some stamps, and get a free meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican stops out there. Family owned and delicious food. I am proudly a regular! Best Green Chile burrito in existence. You've gotta try it at least once!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was a pleasant surprise. Very friendly service. The food had good flavor, and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. Vegetables were not over-cooked which was a huge plus. Generous portions. We did have quite a wait however, but the restaurant was full of other hungry patrons. I wish they had more salad choices. We will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"I first moved to Gilbert in 1992, I was 9. When I first started driving I always got gas at the Diamond Shamrock(now a Valero) that Rio Rico's shares a parking lot with and found it very strange that a restaurant was next to a vet office. Total turn off for me! A couple friends brought up Rio Rico's and I kept saying oh ewwww, I am not going there. They swore by it and said it was by far the best Mexican food they have had! Well all these years later I have been 5 times since July. The first 4 times were nearly every weekend in the month of July. 

I get the same thing every time, the #13, the chips and salsa are AMAZING!! I still think it's weird being next to a vet office but I've gotten past that and just enjoy the delicious food. I could eat their chips and salsa all day long.

I'm already planning my next lunch at Rico's!"}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting since they changed locations.  The food was excellent as always, however the service was really slow. It took over 30 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"Going out with my family.  Originally wanted pizza but decided on Rio Rico. Hadn't been their since they were in their old location.  You couldn't beat the service.  They were there for our every need.  Food was excellent to.   Their hot salsa, we asked for, was hot!  Will definetly be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. I'm from Southern California which has great Mexican food and this place would be among the top of my list.

They are family owned and always so easy to talk with. They remember my name and say hi every time I come in. 

This is the only Mexican restaurant I ever go to in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Thank you the hot delicious food. Made my pregnant wife and I supper happy! We'll recommend it to friends and Family. The fajitas were really juicy, the chimichanga was on the spot. She really loved the guacamole!"}
{"text":"First timers very impressed with food and service. The enchiladas with red sauce were first rate, full of flavor with rice and beans. Salsa had the right amount of kick and the poco de gallo couldn't have been any fresher. Topped it all off with fried ice cream, likely the best I've had ever here in the valley. The business is family owned with a personal touch in service making it a perfect dining experience. A++ grade for sure."}
{"text":"I'm new to Arizona and originally from Chicago so i'm use to the Mexican style of food (Barrio Style).  I've tried several restaurants in search of something that comes close to the flavors of barrio style and not the southwestern/baja mexican fusion i've been running into.  I may have gotten lucky but my first experience was truly delightful.  First, the service was slow but we were in no hurry.  Our waiter was kind and pleasant to my family along with the rest of the staff.  I asked for his recommendation between the Shrimp w/Diablo sauce and the Chicken w/Mole sauce.  It's always difficult to turn down Mole but i followed his recommendation to try the shrimp.  It came with 8 Jumbo shrimps with this incredible diablo sauce.  The sauce was well balanced with tomato's, onions and spices and with a squirt of lime, the flavors just burst in my mouth.  It all came together with the rice and beans and had to take a moment with each spoonfull to enjoy all the flavors that were in each bite.   The spicy sauce, the acidity of the lime and the sweetness of the shrimp, the perfect combination.   Usually most places do not give enough sauce but this dish was drowning in this unblelievable sauce.  It was spicy but not overwhelming, perfect for my palate.  To complete the dining experience, you have to try the fried ice cream.  A sweet sugar dusted fried tortilla bowl containing a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in corn flakes and fried, then drizzled with chocolate and caramel.....ingenious concoction!  I'm am looking forward to going back and trying the Chicken w/Mole and hoping to get the same experience."}
{"text":"After the new owners took over a few years back Rio Rico's has become one of our favorite Mexican food restaurants. The food is excellent, two staples of Mexican cuisine that too many get wrong are guacamole and beans. Rio Rico's has fresh, homemade beans and the guacamole is made  to order. My family and I have tried many of there dishes and have never been disappointed, their giant quesadilla with shredded beef, steak, or chicken is simple yet delicious every time."}
{"text":"Food, service and ambiance were all great!! FYI .. the servers use a phone app to take orders.  No, they are not texting while you are giving them your order, ha, ha.  I had the tamale & chile relleno combo.. beans are homemade deliciousness. Flavors were tasty. My boyfriend had the carne asada plate and he let me try the carne....it was juicy and full of flavor.  Finished off with soft, warm sopapillas. Best thing I thought stood out, was that all staff worked as a team. Every worker that came by either took our plate or offered us a beverage refill.. we never had to wait for service.  TEAMWORK! We will be back."}
{"text":"I would've given three stars if not for the neglected, dust covered ceiling around the fans and vents. That's not a good sign of cleanliness.

The food: my chili relleno was spongy, the tacos were soggy, and the enchilada had a weird taste. The rice was bland, but the beans were great.

The service was lackadaisical.

Wow, I guess I actually didn't like this place. Too bad. It's been here a long time, and this is the first time we've tried it.

Oh, the chips and salsa were really good, and the place has an authentic ambience."}
