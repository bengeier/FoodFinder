{"text":"We thought it was a cool concept. However, the customer service needs work. A couple machines not in service, we lost tokens on one. Wish they served beer, it was BYOB though."}
{"text":"An awesome place to kill a couple hours. I love Medievil Madness!  The local, retro pinball machines are also a fun throwback. Make sure to check out the floor when you enter."}
{"text":"Disclaimer -- I'm a friend of Brian Holderman, the artist who did the murals, and he has worked on film projects with me before.  That said, I love this cafe! The art is amazing.  You get to play pinball games. The floor is a giant mural that lights up like you are walking inside a pinball machine.    There is going to be an arcade with more pinball machines opening upstairs, it's in a cool neighborhood, and the coffee was good.  I had a fancy salad that was good too.  One other thing -- kids love the games, but some of the artwork is a bit on the mature side.  Check out the photos to see if that sort of thing is an issue for you, or just stick with the Addams Family and other licensed games."}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  Pinball is awesome.  4 stars because the food is fine... not great.  but there is so much pinball!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a roadtrip and had so much fun! I would love to have a place like this near us. I would go to study and have pinball brain breaks. We had drinks customized for us at their cafe bar and spent about an hour going through $20 worth of coins. Great ambiance, friendly people, well worth it. Tshirts were awesome but they didnt have the fiance's size (I dont think there are many husky pinball players in Pittsburgh) ;-P"}
{"text":"Even if you are not into pinball, Kickback is a nice place to stop.  The sandwiches, coffee, and other beverages are all reasonably priced and decent quality. The food servings are on the small side, so you might not get completely full eating here, but if you're just stopping for a quick bite or snack, then that's fine.  They have a limited amount of tables, so if you are there to eat on a busy evening, you may not be able to find a seat.  The staff are all friendly and seem knowledgeable about coffee, pinball, and other local hangouts.  They usually have a handful of machines downstairs and a lot more upstairs. The variety of machines is good and rotates regularly, but I've never seen every machine full operational at the same time. At any given time, 30-50% of the machines are out of order or not working properly.  Kickback is now BYOB, which is great, but the cost to B your own B is pretty high. I brought a six-pack of beer in and was told it would be $1 a beer. $6 on top of the original cost of the six-pack is a lot more than I want to spend. Other BYOB places usually have a smaller fee.  Overall, Kickback is a pretty great place. I've been here many times and plan to keep on going. I'd recommend it to anybody looking to grab a quick coffee, or looking to waste a couple of hours playing pinball."}
{"text":"Great Place for Lunch With Man Children of All Ages!  We picked this place to kick off our Christmas break with The Little Man and it was a total win!!!   Great concept! Pinball, coffee, tea & Italian soda and great food!!! Delicious sandwiches and even though the kid menu is slim it's fresh & delicious!  Adults partook in The Scared Stiff (chicken, goat cheese & red pepper on ciabatta) and a Buffalo Chicken Sammie (pulled chicken with buffalo sauce) and it was delish! Also they have KALE CHIPS! They have multiple varieties & they are super tasty.   I just really enjoyed I could have good food and play pinball with my munchkin! While remaining the ever hip, current & trendy mom that I am (-;   Come here for a hipster alternative to Dave n Busters! The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Good food, pinball, coffee, and fun! It's always nice to see a business that isn't just another *insert cliche here*. I'm horrible at pinball but that's okay. It's just as fun to watch someone else play who actually can handle it. They have a lot of fun machines here, though I wonder how them employees don't go insane listening to them do their repetitive thing all day when no one is playing them..."}
{"text":"I will say I did not try the food today. But it was nice being able to play a game of pinball with out screaming kids around. I had not played in years but they have a great selection of game. Some I remember from when I was a kid and new ones like the walking dead. I also have to say it gives great value for the amount you spend. I spent about 9$ for an hour of play time and if I had not sucked I bet I could of extended that time."}
{"text":"If you love pinball, this is the place to be. It took me back to my childhood. I seriously haven't seen a pinball machine in a decade or longer!! Not only do they have pinball, they also serve coffee and food. I think it's a great concept and a fun place to hang out to do something different for a change. The staff is pretty laid back and friendly too."}
{"text":"I went here over July with my cousin who was visiting from Boston.  He is a collector and pinball aficionado.  I like that they have added something in Lawrenceville like this, especially for my friends who are no longer drinkers or they are teetotalers.  I did not get a chance to eat there since we had already had dinner, but the sandwiches smelled like heavenly grilled sammies!  I was a little underwhelmed with the amount of machines they had.  It looked so much more robust from the pictures on line.  However, they did have a nice selection of games.  Not being the pinball wizard like cousin Pete, I am relying on his opinion here!  I like the set up, location and the fact that it has a small menu and it is byob.  This is a nice option to just a bar/restaurant.  The day we were there, it seemed as if 2 or 3 of the machines weren't accepting coins correctly, or you put in your coins and then it wouldn't turn on and you had to get refunded.  I hope they can keep the machines serviced well and maybe putting a sign on the machine if several people upstairs are coming down to get a refund.  I will try it out again with my nephews and hope that these kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"Walking along Butler Street trying to kill some time, when I walked past Kickback Pinball Cafe. The sidewalk sign mentioning coffee & tea caught my eye, as I didn't know there was a coffee shop in this spot of Lawrenceville. That's when I looked to my left, and saw a beautiful sight... pinball machines. I obviously had to go inside. I ordered an iced red raspberry tea, which was delicious. I sipped on the tasty tea while I played various pinball games including Creature of the Black Lagoon, Iron Man, Family Guy, Twilight Zone, an old school Monster one and a vintage pinball game that looked like it was from the 60s or 70s. You must use tokens to play the games, which you purchase from the front counter. I had a blast playing the games and drinking my delicious iced tea. Not only is this place super cool, but the woman working behind the counter was SO NICE. Amazing customer service.  I had no idea a cafe like this existed in Pittsburgh and now I am greatly anticipating my next return!"}
{"text":"First of all, I like how Pittsburgh keeps on surprising me.  I had no clue that Pittsburgh had a pinball cafe and would have never known if someone else told me about it.    This space is fun.  It's got the old school arcade vibe mixing with a chill cafe/work space vibe.  Walking in you kind of think to yourself that there aren't many pinball machines, but then you notice stairs that lead up to a loft area.  Tokens can be obtained at the counter or upstairs at a change machine.  One token equals one quarter, but you MUST have tokens because that is only what the machines take.  When you walk upstairs it's kind of an amazing sight.  Nearly a dozen pinball machines line the walls as you first walk up there.  Towards the front of the building is a loft opening that looks down unto the first floor.  On the other side of the opening is more seating if you would prefer to dine or work up here.    When we were here, it was a bit warm, but not overbearing.  Some of the machines were down for repair, but a majority of them are in great working order, especially given the age of some of them.  Be careful with some of the machines, they will gobble up your tokens, but not register.  What you will notice is there is a whiteboard in the upstairs area that you can leave suggestions/complaints on to address any certain machine.  Food and drink are available for purchase in here, but I did not partake in either.  It is a fun place to spend some time and one I will probably return to in the near future."}
{"text":"What a hipster/cool place. You can get coffee or food and study and also play pinball machines. What a concept! I imagine that it would be fun to come here to study, then reward yourself for working hard with a game of pinball. The staff was super friendly and nice. I had the watermelon habanero lime etc. lemonade and it was SOO GOOD. It had a perfect kick to it. The games are kind of expensive...like 75 cents per game, some were only 50 cents. It had a very cool vibe. I also hear it's BYOB so that would also be a huge perk."}
{"text":"This was a fun little place. The staff was helpful. I only dinged this place a little because walking in the ground floor decor isn't super inviting; it almost feels empty."}
{"text":"Very fun place to stop while in Lawrenceville!   About 15 pinball machines, old and new, that range from 50 to 75 cents per play. If you love pinball, definitely stop by!  Downstairs, there is a coffee shop with reasonably priced coffee, tea, and a small menu of sandwiches. The staff has always been very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I was in town for the PAPA 16 tournament and since my qualifying wasn't going well, decided to head out to the record stores and do some retail therapy.  As I was walking through Lawrenceville I noticed this place with pinball machines and a pinball theme and had to check it out.  Ordered a sandwich and played a few games.  The sandwich was most excellent as was the pinball.  The games all worked great and the re-themed EM pins were really cool and a lot of fun.  The only drawbacks were that it was absolutely dead on a saturday afternoon when I would expect there to be a few people hanging around and having a nice lunch, and it's almost so well done inside that it feels uncomfortable hanging about.  I think this needs a little more of the neighborhood dive feel to it to be honest.  I feel bad saying that as it was clearly a lot of work to construct and very well done."}
{"text":"Kickback is a really fun place, definitely entertaining for a couple of hours! The decor is fun and bright and really gets you in the mood for some pinball. The machines are, for the most part, in great shape - there's usually only 2 or 3 down every time we visit.   Their food is pretty great, considering it's all done on small machines right behind the counter. I'm an especially big fan of their DIY salad combinations, since you can get all kinds of exciting things atop your greens. Don't expect to eat anything heavy, though their paninis are good.  Also of note, they're BYOB and if you ask ahead, you can hold a party there. We invited some friends, brought a cake and some beer, and got a handful of tokens for everybody. It was tons of fun!"}
{"text":"I have stopped by here twice now in the past couple of weeks.  The first time was on a Saturday morning with my fiance for coffee and the last time was on a Wednesday for lunch with my father.  Both times there hasn't been many people in the cafe which I find to be a shame.  The inside of the restaurant is decorated whimsically as the floor is painted like the bottom of the pinball machine while the tables are made to look like bumpers.  Besides all of that there are about 5 pinball machines with 2 of them being newer and 3 being of the older type.  Whenever I stopped by with my fiance, I ordered an Americano as did she.  The coffee was smooth and ended up tasting good without too much bitterness which I enjoyed.  We also bought $1 worth of tokens (its frustrating to me that they don't allow quarters) and played the Adams Family pinball game which we both enjoyed.  Whenever I went with my father I ended up ordering the squealer for lunch which consisted of ham, mustard, rosemary and I forget what else that came out on a 6\"(?) bun pressed like a panini,  I really enjoyed the taste of my sandwich, especially the subtle rosemary hints at the end.  While both my dad and I thought our respective sandwiches were good, sadly neither one of us thought that the sandwich was big enough to be a full lunch, much less justify the price that we paid.  Due to that we ended up stopping at a Wendys on the way home.  Even so my dad and I ended up enjoying ourselves after spending about $5 on pinball (Addam's Family and Terminator 3) which is the real reason that we came.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  While I do not imagine that I would eat here again due to the high cost versus amount of food given, I did enjoy what I had eaten and can really see myself stopping here on leisurely Saturday morning for a Americano and game of pinball."}
{"text":"really cool spot coffee is .. meh"}
{"text":"Support local projects like this!  Very nice staff, kid friendly atmosphere. Good coffee. All machines worked well.  Will be returning with my son again. Take your head out of a smart phone for 2 hours and enjoy your life again.  Bookstores, record shops, and arcades are all dying... Drive or walk there and check it out."}
{"text":"Cute place with pretty awesome sandwiches. Enjoyed playing some pinball while teaching the kids the art of a good flipper."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of pinball games. From old to new (mostly new), they have an impressive selection. Also a very cool space designed to look like the play field of a pinball machine. Not much else going on here. Ok coffee and Italian sodas. A liquor license would make this place incredible. Or even a solid deli effort."}
{"text":"Dipped in quickly on a 15 minute break for a grilled reuben sandwich.  Got my food fast and it was delicious.  Place is nice, outlets at every seat for those of us who don't like to unplug. I would go again!  Would only be made better by the ability to buy liquor there!"}
{"text":"I got to take my mom and brother here on a snowy day last year and it was an experience I'll never forget. There were a dozen machines, ranging from the 1950's and 1960's to more recent (my mom preferred the older ones since you can \"get more physical\" with them - I had no idea she was such a wizard). There was even a game that one of the owners built from scratch! Delicious lattes, custom painted floors, and retro seating areas just added to the experience. I definitely wish there was a coffee shop like this on the West Coast. I'd be a regular here if I was local."}
{"text":"This place is a blast!  A great spot for a fun afternoon, a date, or an outing with kids. There are two floors and a total of about 20 pinball machines. A variety of panini sandwiches/grilled cheeses are available for purchase along with coffees and sodas. You can BYOB for just a fee of $5 and there's a small fridge where you can store your beverages.   Pinball games are played with tokens, which are 25 cents a piece. Games run anywhere from 2-4 tokens a play.   I'm a big fan of the Star Trek: The Next Generation machine as well as the Family Guy machine. There's a great variety of game play!  Overall, a really fun time!"}
{"text":"What a change! My friends and I just stumbled into this place while walking around the neighborhood. I easily could have killed hours of time here. We didn't stay and eat, but would definitely consider it another time since it's also BYOB.   It was also make a very creative date night!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and fun pinball games. Paying for games through a Bluetooth App is convenient and a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Just had the lattes and played a little pinball.  Nice place, clean, and a nice variety of pinball machines.  Will return!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing all around. If you like pinball, you have to come here at least once. When I stopped in, it was pretty crowded, but I had no trouble finding a table to play. Each game is pretty affordable too.   Their selection changes from what I understand. A few tables I saw last included The Walking Dead, Medieval Madness and several fantastic other tables.   The drink selection here is nice, and whoever made my mocha did an excellent job. The drinks are affordable, too, so that's an added bonus. You won't see Starbucks prices here.   Kickback has an excellent vibe to destress and have fun. Whether you want to game for hours, a few minutes or chill with a group of friends, this is the right environment for that.  I look forward to spending much more time here in the future and snagging one of their sexy t-shirts."}
{"text":"Great artwork, pinball machines and great food!!! What's not to like?!?!? The watermelon habanero lemonade is amazing!!!!! Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My Partner in Cuisine and I love Pinball (and food) so when we heard about this place a while back, we were really excited to try it.  We finally decided to stop in for lunch a couple Saturdays ago and were not disappointed!  The food was surprisingly excellent and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, the upstairs (where most of the games are) was not open at the time, but we still stayed for a good two hours playing the games on the main floor.  We did find it somewhat alarming that the place was so dead.  This place is a charming little hole in the wall and I hope that it can manage to stay in business.  Even if you don't care for pinball, at least come for the panini!  I think the upstairs is open by now so the PIC and I will be back soon!  PS - Get a Medieval Madness machine and the PIC and I will personally keep you in business!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this Cafe. I won't lie, I love me some pinball. I have been inside one time before, but just to look around. This time I came to hang out and to use the free interwebz. My fiance is in love with their coffee so he came along with me. He got a latte and I was really excited to try the raspberry lemonade. The barista even allowed me to have a pre-taste to see if I would like it. Lemonade is something that could be so many things, sour, too sweet, tart, etc. This blend of fresh squeezed fruit was perfect. Not to sweet, not to sour, perfect. Christopher's latte was also delicious. I am not the biggest coffee fan, but this one was pretty good!   Now, why I came to the cafe was to use the internet. It worked, which is a good thing, but there were not many tables/comfortable places to sit and to work. It was also really loud with the pinball machines. Not the most productive place to sit and work. I got done what I needed but I would not recommend coming here to work.   The pinball machines were also wonderful. It is a really nice place to come and hang out and maybe have fun with friends. It was more a hang out place than a get work done place.   I would go back, but not to work!"}
{"text":"I do like this place a lot. I've been in for pinball but more often I go in for the homemade lemonade. It's SO good! The habanero, watermelon and basil is the best! The last time I went in the service was poor from the woman behind the counter. Hopefully that's not going to be the new normal.   The decor is so cool and really fits the neighborhood. It's definitely a unique place and I really hope that it's here for a while!"}
{"text":"I love taking my family here and I love coming here with friends. The pinball machine selection is great and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place but was disappointed when I finally came to check it out. Yes, there are a lot of pinball machines from different eras but quite a few of them were out of order. I'm not sure if they simply didn't have enough outlets or the machines needed maintenance but either way I felt the selection was lacking. The other problem with this place is that it's too sterile. The place was entirely too quiet and didn't seem to have much soul. This place could benefit from having some live music or at the very least some sort of stereo system playing an ipod throughout the establishment. I would also hope they're applying for some sort of liquor license as this place definitely needs to start serving cocktails and beer. All-in-all I would give this place a 2.5 but there is definitely potential!  Quick Tip: Buy your booze ahead of time as this place is BYOB but the nearest wine store is a few blocks away. I'm lazy so I didn't find that walk to be pleasant."}
{"text":"Only the Beehive of the mid-90's can approach Kickback for the nirvana of pinball and cool dive in one package. The staff here, on an incredibly busy night, were very friendly and accommodating and made terrific sandwiches while enduring the chaos of the pre-Pinburgh event. I do wish the upstairs were a bit more, um, reinforced for the weight and stress, but under normal conditions there's plenty of space and plenty of pins. Nota bene to newbies (I am one), tokens are required. Best of luck to the new management - kudos for plunging in. (Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.)"}
{"text":"Such a great place to have in Pittsburgh. As places like Dave and Busters don't have pinball anymore it can be difficult to find arcades with many machines. Having a dedicated location for it is wonderful.   No idea what someone said about the byob price being high, it's two bucks per person that's nothing.   A few of the machines were out of order but that's to be expected with how difficult to maintain pinball machines are.   The payrange app is nice for the fancier machines.   Will absolutely be back again and again."}
{"text":"When I'm here I feel like a kid again. I loved playing pinball when I was just a wee one. I wasn't very good and I'm still not but boy do I have fun. I love this space and the variety of machines. Menu is pleasing with a variety of beverages and light fare. OMG I love the caprese  sandwich as well as the limited time only jalapeño popper grilled cheese... And the habanero watermelon lemonade; inject it into my veins please."}
{"text":"Only giving it four stars because I didn't order any coffee or snacks. But loved it. I learned the world championship of pin balling is held in Pittsburgh. My favorite machine is the Indiana Jones one. Bring dollar bills and coins. Only put tokens in the pin ball machine. No coins."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here when walking Butler. A tournament was happening, so we watched a little. I've always been pretty mediocre at pinball but these folks were really good. We played a couple rounds too and mostly just ended up laughing at how terrible we were. This place is really cute; most of the machines are upstairs, which overlooks the first floor. They serve some pretty unique sandwiches, specialty sodas, and coffee drinks. Definitely a fun place to hang out!"}
