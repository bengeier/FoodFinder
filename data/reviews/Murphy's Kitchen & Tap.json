{"text":"Great staff, awesome food and great location. Fries, Lamb Sammy and fresh Mules hit the spot. This place will be a Charlotte staple in no time. Good work Murph and crew."}
{"text":"This is a a cute place to eat pub fair and convent to the Charlotte Airport. Service was good and food was filling. Not a gourmet experience, but a nice place to grab a bite of good food and a beer."}
{"text":"Great authentic reuben sandwich!  Good portion sizes at a fair price.  Friendly workers.  I'm new to Charlotte and there are a lot of restaurants nearby uptown, but this is definitely one I'll be going back to."}
{"text":"I really wish this place was terrible.... Because it's so good, that I'm going to gain a minimum of 10lbs on the amazing savory pies. My buddy ordered a steak dish & I of course stuck a fork in it! The meat is so tender, the cauliflower potatoes au gratin are to die for & the dish even comes with a cheddar biscuit. What?! Did I mention heavy pours & reasonable drink prices? You need to eat here. Now. Or not. I don't like crowds."}
{"text":"The food is excellent - try the shepherd's pie.  The beer selection is decent enough.  Atmosphere is inviting and what you would expect for an Irish pub at this price point.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place not only has the best food in the city, a great selection of beers, beautiful women and great service- it has FREAKIN' MURPHY! I'm pretty sure he was elected as CLT's coolest person with an Irish accent back in 2008. I love this place. If you go there and don't like everything about it, it's not Murphy's; it's you."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I loved the shepherd pie but lose a star for service. All I ask if a server is keep our drinks refilled. I hate more than anything to go through a whole meal without a drink especially when you guys have small glasses to begin with. Other than that great place."}
{"text":"Great new bi-level restaurant in uptown with a go- to lunch and dinner menu. Owner operated which makes the experience much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was traveling through Charlotte and decided to stop in at murphys to grab a quick bite. It's a new pub, which is located across from the baseball stadium - plenty of parking which I found to be very convenient given how much of a challenge parking in uptown can be.   The staff were great and were familiar with the menu which was a help - I ended up ordering the lamb burger - see attached pic. Wasn't sure what to expect, but wow is all I can say. Shredded lamb, tomato jam, the works. Way better than most burger bars.   Plenty of good beers on tap and bottles and lots of craft cocktails. The bartender was showing off some of his skills - I'll have to go back to try some of their house drinks.   Check this place out for sure!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere! Delicious entrees and salads. They have a large selection of beer choices too."}
{"text":"When in Charlotte....the Reuben is \"best in eastern seaboard\" per the owner!!! And he did not fail! Great great Sammie and the Cheddar Ale Soup is amazing"}
{"text":"Best Irish pub in Charlotte. Great Scenery, Great Service, Great Beer & Great Food. Recommend the Deviled Eggs and The  Sausage Hand Pies."}
{"text":"I have been planning our summer trip to Ireland, so my husband surprised me with picking out this place for dinner on Friday night. We walked in with Irish music playing and the dark-ish interior making that \"pub feel\" and I knew we were in the right place!  We both started with a pint of Harp and ordered the deviled eggs and cheddar and ale soup to start. The deviled eggs weren't my cup of tea. However, I don't particularly enjoy deviled eggs to begin with so my opinion doesn't mean anything on this subject! The cheddar and ale soup was outstanding. I mean, I pictured myself on a cold rainy day in Ireland just devouring this soup. It was super rich so one cup was plenty. We then split the Shepherds Pie. I have no earthly clue how one person can finish this, kudos to you if you have. It was a huge portion and so absolutely delicious. The flavors blended perfectly together.   I am so glad we finally checked out Murphy's. Awesome spot. Sláinte!"}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with this place.  It reminds me of the local neighborhood Irish  bars in NJ and in parts of NYC.  The people that work there are very, very nice and helpful.  The beer, wine and liquor selection is top notch.  The food is SPECTACULAR.  Try the lamb burger....Very, very good.  They have a house vegetable dish, steamed veggies mixed with chopped up potatoes....WOW.  Prices-  VERY FAIR.  Give it a shot"}
{"text":"Food is okay but service has always been painfully slow especially at lunch. The waitress never refills the drinks and you have to ask if she does decide to come by.  Also she's quite forgetful. I've been here multiple times but the poor service makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a little off the beaten path (which, after spending hours near the epicentre, is exactly what we wanted). We got a bunch of small plates to share: pretzel bites, bacon turnover, cheddar and ale soup, ham and turkey croquettes.. Just to name a few. Each dish was incredible, and tasted authentic. We were not expecting to find such great Irish food in the south. To top it off, we had great service from our waiter, Alex. We were able to bring our dog and sit on their front patio, which was super laid back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Beer is cold.  Reuben was delicious. Fries tasty.  My husband had Irish stew and said it was delicious.  Service good. Nicole was our server.  Very friendly"}
{"text":"IRISIH PUB FOOD. Came to murphy's for an early dinner. Didn't even know what the place was before I entered the restaurant. Once I realised it was Irish pub food o knew I better come hungry. I ordered traditional Irish / English fish and chips. The fish was very breaded and traditional and not very oily. The chips (fries) were perfect with a special order of a horseradish honey mustard. I would recommend this place for a casual dinner or work lunch. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very traditional. Great all around resultant for Irish / English food."}
{"text":"Wings were terrible, we only got 5 instead of 6 and waitress said would discount them and forgot.  Also forgot to add salmon to my fiancé's salad.  Pretty pitiful service.  I never tip less than 20% ever and I only tipped 10 for this waitress.  We won't be going back.  Beer was good, that's about it and it took 20 minutes to get that.  How they have 5 stars on here I will never know."}
{"text":"We are in town for a few days and decided to go here for a quick bite , we ordered the potato croquettes for an appetizer which were recommended by our waitress, I wasn't impressed at all. I ordered the Rueben sandwich with the vegetables and it was lacking the sauerkraut so I asked for more since there was barely any on my sandwich, to my surprise when we got the bill we were charged 1.00 for this bad imitation of sauerkraut. I asked our waitress and she explained the only way she could get me more was to add the dollar charge. Wow! That's some great customer service. She asked for the charge to be removed and they took it off even though the guy she asked wanted to know what table was asking, (not sure why that mattered). The bread was a little burnt and the meat wasn't very tender. My husband said his fish and chips were good. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been in a few times for drinks and grub and have been pleasantly surprised! the bartenders are friendly and the whiskey is delicious. you should check it out!"}
{"text":"The best burger and fried chicken sandwich in all of Charlotte. Guaranteed. Service is awesome as well. Highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"Great food and good mix of craft beers along with your European staples that you'd expect in a good Irish Pub. Friendly folks and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cozy casual in all its finest, Murphy's provides the perfect comfort of good drinks, company, and food. The simple decor of its charming space provides a good stop post a Knights game or a night out, while the satisfaction of a true \"comfort\" meal keeps me coming back.   I've tried the Deviled Scotch Eggs (to die for), the Housemade Pretzels with Guinness Stout Mustard and Beer Cheese Dip, Shepherd's Pie (my favorite) and the Blue Cheese Sirloin with Potatoes and Green Beans (hold the blue cheese, please) and would genuinely recommend all of the above. My favorite, and go to for the last 3 visits, is the Shepherd's Pie. I truly find pure contentment and satisfaction in seeing this dish of torched mashed potatoes on a bed of lamb, peas and carrots land on my table. Did I mention steam radiates out of the potato mountain with every bite? It's pretty magical. To top off the experience, the staff here is amazing! I've always felt like I'm being welcomed into an Irish home when I come, and then usually leave with a new best friend. Thanks, Murph! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Family and I decided to have dinner here due to all the positive reviews and proximity to our hotel. As we entered, the noise was a little louder than expected. The name suggests kitchen followed by taproom. It actually seems like a bar that happens to serve food. Nonetheless, we we greeted by our server who promptly took our orders.  We ordered the scotch eggs, pretzel bites with cheese dip, shepards pie, ale cheese soup, Irish stew, and just water. Decided not to drink.  After a short wait our food was delivered and presented very well. We all agreed the scotch eggs and pretzel bits were very tasty. The shepards pie was average as I make this dish occasionally at home. The Irish stew was pretty good and had an abundance of meat. The ale cheese soup seemed to be a little off on the flavor and texture. In the end we were somewhat satisfied overall. Probably won't return for dinner, maybe for a few drinks.   It is a great Irish bar if that was my initial intention."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was phenomenal and very authentic! The decor and music make you feel like you are in Ireland. I met the owners Megan and Mark Murphy. Mark was born and raised in Ireland so he knows Irish food. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I had a reuben sandwich today that changed my life. Being from Detroit, I don't ask for a lot BUT I want a few hometown wonders to exist everywhere that I go. If you want a reuben, stop looking and go to Murphy's. This is the Reuben you need. I didn't even realize until after I'd devoured the whole thing that a pickle or mustard would be nice. Grab 5 pints of Guinness, too. It tastes like heaven. Thanks Murphy's!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte to get lunch or dinner, or just to stop in for a beer. The staff is always wonderful and the deviled scotch eggs are my favorite thing in the entire world. The Shepard's pie french fries are a close second."}
{"text":"I've been planning to have lunch here for months and finally made it with one of my foodie buddies.  We decided to get there right at the opening since we heard they were popular during the week.  It was empty when we arrived, so we were able to order right away but I couldn't decide what I wanted as there wasn't much that impressed me on the menu.  I ended up with the Irish stew which was just ok, and my friend said the wings were good.  I plan to give them another shot as I may have just ordered the wrong thing on this visit."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch since this is Yelp's Reuben Week.  Mmmm.  Was met by Brooke, who could not have been sweeter and she worked me through the menu, the daily specials, and eventually my order:  a Reuben sandwich, no fries and a cup of cheddar ale soup (only a $1 upcharge if you sub out the fries).  Cool.  The soup was delicious with a good balance of cheddar and ale.  Creamy texture and perfect temperature made me doubly happy.  The Reuben was abundant with meat, on toasted dark rye, sauce and sauerkraut.  Was it the best Reuben I've eaten?  Probably no.  But a darn good one.  I would like the bread to be slightly toasted on both sides (so not to suck up the sauce leaving the bread wet), and also sliced thicker.  I'm from New York so I am spoiled with over the top sandwiches.  I left happy and my tummy full.  What more could you ask?!  A return visit?  Sure!"}
{"text":"Great time at Murphy's while visiting my son in Charlotte. Terrific atmosphere, great food and drinks and fun social people. Will definitely return on our next trip and look forward to heading upstairs for a sun set view!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!  Short version: Food is great, service is friendly, place is clean...go!  Long version: stopped in for late lunch on a Saturday. The lunch menu was sort of limited but everything ordered was good or great.   My party and I almost ordered all of the starters. We began with the Holiday ham and Turkey croquettes, Pretzel bites and Loaded Boxties (pronounced Box-tees not Box-ties).  All of those were super fresh and piping hot when they were served. The croquettes were perfect, crunchy crust with warm, soft center served over tomato jam. Delicious!  The Pretzel Bites are like small pretzel knots with an \"everything\" seasoning similar to that on an everything bagel minus the onion. The warm mustard served with it makes it great! The Loaded Boxties are like loaded potato skins but in a potato patty base and with no cheese (which I was very happy about because I can't have cheese on the moment). Very tasty.  We also ordered the Greek burger (on special) with fries and a Beef and Stout Meat Pie. The burger was good. Nothing amazing but well seasoned and tender. The meat pie was very flavor and also super fresh.   No room for dessert and I don't drink beer but I could see that they had Stella on draught as well as several others."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Irish fare.  I got the Shepherd's Pie and my wife got the Irish Stew.  Both excellent choices.  The soda bread was good as well. The staff was friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!!! The food here is just simply amazing!!!!!  We had the irish sausage hand pie and the ruben. I have to say the food we had was outstanding.i honestly cant wait to come back and try a few other items. I have been to ireland a couple times and i really think the food is better here.  The atmosphere is really nice. They spent some money on the buildout.   This is a great bar!  I hoghly reccomend you give them a try. This place is bad a$$!!!!!"}
{"text":"In the three months my boyfriend and I have lived here this has easily become our favorite bar. Bill is the best bartender hands down. The first night we went in we met the owners who are from Ireland but moved to Massachusetts (we are from Boston) so we felt we had something in common. The staff has always been polite, the place is clean, the food and great and so are the drinks.  Any review less than 5 stars seems to be a seating issue. This place is popular, we don't always get a seat at the bar or the table we prefer because it's crowded. That's a good issue to have as a business though."}
{"text":"The food was exceptionally great from the apps to the deserts.  I was very impressed with both the presentation and the taste.  Some of my favorites included the shepherd's pie w/ fries in it and a caramel pretzel fluffy desert.  Server was very attentive and friendly as was the rest of the staff and owner who we got to meet. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best GD burger in Charlotte. 10 stars. Jack is the man tending bar!  60% of the time it works every time!"}
{"text":"When I tell you I LOVE everything about this place, it could easily be my \"Cheers\". The food is amazing - which is an understatement, bartenders are on it, and the layout with up & down bars with tvs spread everywhere makes this my fav new spot.   Must Try - Reuben & Fries.  On buttery pumpernickel bread, outstanding seasonings of the meats & fries were delish while original. On ny radar - Fish & Chips but it was only on dinner menu so I had the reuben which was just by far an experience.    Go experience Murphy's!"}
{"text":"Awwwwww I hate to do this but I went back for dinner and brought my colleagues. The fish and chips was different and seemed typical battered cod. They were busy so service was not up to par. I would still check them out but not 5 star. Below is my original experience.   This place definitely lives up the reviews posted here. I stopped through tonight for dinner as I travel here for business. I will be honest, I am not really an Irish Pub kinda girl. Maybe because I don't drink beer or crave shepherds pie. That does not matter tonight because the food was soooooo amazing and the service was top notch! The fish and chips will put you in a good coma but absolutely delicious! They are are not afraid to poor a glass of wine like some of these new restaurants with enough wine for a shot glass! My server was Amanda. Super pleasant, super attentive and I felt like I was her only customer (although I was not). There is separate music playing upstairs and you can hear it downstairs but have a few drinks and you will be fine! Surprisingly upstairs was a bit of hip hop/ pop and r&b. Check this place out. If you have good taste for good and great service, you will love it even if you typically don't go to Irish Pubs!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday to celebrate a friends engagement. Food was good, some of the best wings I've had in Charlotte! Would come again just for the curry wings!    The only down fall is the menu, as I'm from England. This menu is so confusing! I ordered the Irish sausage hand pie, and was expecting a pie! But it was a sausage roll, two tiny ones at that. Was very dissatisfied indeed as it's very misleading.  It's not whipped potatoes! It's mashed potatoes. And I don't remember the crazy name they had for French fries. You're an Irish bar, just keep it simple!"}
{"text":"Great food, fair selection of beer and an awesome staff. Super friendly. Recommend the chicken sandwich and all the apps are great. As far as \"Irish\" pubs go, it's pretty authentic as far as this area goes."}
{"text":"This is an Irish bar with a warm and inviting atmosphere, friendly staff -- especially Murphy himself, and a love of playing Futbol (while they do play many sports like NFL and PGA on their TVs, Murphy loves himself some Liverpool). Come for a pint of Guinness and stay for some delicious Irish pub food.  While I haven't ordered them yet, the Irish Deviled Eggs are very popular here. The fish and chips is also gargantuan, so you've got to be starving for that big boy! A non-Irish menu item that they do extremely well comes from their Sammie menu, proving the chatter around Charlotte is true: Murphy's has one of -- if not the best -- REUBENs in town. While this sammie will set you back $9.95, it's packed with corned beef and pastrami, house made sauerkraut, and 1000 island in between two toasted and buttered rye slices, and comes with a side of seasoned house fries. Try to take just one bite of it, I dare you!  They've got a small patio for enjoying the warm weather, a large first floor with a mix of high tops and regular tables, and then upstairs is another bar area, which is great for an event space/gathering."}
{"text":"Murphy's is my neighborhood pub so I am a little prejudice, great friendly atmosphere, staff and locals.  My brother was in town so we decided to go eat there.  The best kept secret in uptown Charlotte is the steak at Murphy.  Nice portio, cook perfectly served with green beans and mash.  At a great price. There are a plethora of steak places in Uptown willing to charge you $150/ea for a steak, Murphy's is just as good for about 20% the price (under $30). Ever in the mood for a steak Murphy's is the place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! They pour a great Guinness and the food is unreal. I had the Scott Eggs and both hand pies as my meal. The food is well prepared and fresh. The owner Mark Murphy made sure we were well taken care of. I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Recently my office got moved to Gateway Village and shy of Little Village Grille, the food options aren't great. However, if I just extend myself to the other side of the tracks (literally), less than half-a-mile, there is this gem.  I went because Nikki W. suggested it and had an awesome review, and, she kind of knows her restaurants in Charlotte.  I got the Rueben and fries (complete with malt vinegar crème). While a little pricy for lunch, it's honestly the best Rueben I've had in the city. Really good meat and not over sauced. I really can't wait to try other things on the menu.  My only consternation is that they don't serve their Fish and Chips during lunch and I'm never in the area for dinner. My dad is from England so every time we fly over to visit family, Fish and Chips is 50% of my meals. I've yet to find a decent chippy in the city. But the superb Rueben gives me high hope they can finally satisfy my cravings. If they ever offer it for lunch.  UPDATE: I received a message saying they can accommodate Fish and Chips for lunch. So, next week I'll \"forget\" my sad little sandwich at home and venture up the street again. Really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Great food, absolutely delicious. In fact, the food far exceeds the service. I'll be  back."}
{"text":"The salmon was absolutely amazing. Veggies, potatoes, top notch. Honestly may be the best salmon I have had in charlotte. Will definitely return; service was great."}
{"text":"I had been here a few times just for just drinks but last night we came for dinner before the Panthers preseason game. We were seated at the last empty table upstairs. My favorite area of Murphy's is the upstairs as I feel like it has better vibes and the covered patio looks super fun. We were greeted by a friendly and energetic waitress who had way too many tables and she handled her rush with grace. We ordered drinks and appetizers. When our drinks came we ordered our entrees. Service was predictably slow but we never felt forgotten and our waitress apologized every time. Our entrees came out before our appetizers but the appetizers were not far behind.   The Deviled Scotch Eggs were life changing. Get them. Eat them. Love your life. On to the entrees, I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the Shepherd's pie. The fish and chips were fine, not life changing. the fries were good but a little too salty for my taste. I would recommend one of the more traditional dishes as those were delicious.   Definitely a great place that cares about authenticity and food quality. They definitely handled the pre-panthers rush well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good beer, good food - nice and chill place to just relax and enjoy the $3.00 beers -can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We ordered the croquettes and stout pies, and not a crumb was left on the plate. Then the folks next to us ordered the scotch eggs, so we did too and I'm glad we did! Murph was our bartender (you may recognize him, he's been at another popular Irish bar in town for years) and is clearly a hard worker... I've seen lots of restaurants go thru this location but I really hope this one sticks."}
{"text":"Only came for drinks, didn't try any of the food. The vodka sodas were made well, and the bartender was super nice and so were the other patrons at the bar. I'd come back solely for that and the cute rooftop bar area. They also play some pretty good music, mix of pop and hiphop."}
{"text":"My legal ID from the state of Illinois was turned down here. The bar tender working said he couldn't take my ID because it was laminated. He was totally wrong, it was a legal ID. I guess they have to be really sticky because of he students that live close by... other than that they had a decent salad and decent service."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. Nice location close to BB&T Ballpark and Bank of America Stadium. Friendly people. A nice stop for happy hour."}
{"text":"I had the Braised Pork Shoulder... it was sublime. They provided a steak knife, but honestly, it was so well cooked, that it was like butter. I never had such a great meal at a pub. The bar tender, Murphy, was kind and friendly; when I mentioned a planned trip to Ireland, he was able to refer some must see, life changing, places. Great atmosphere and friendly service form the hostess, waitress, and bar tender. Even the regulars are friendly. Overall I would highly, highly recommend Murphy's"}
{"text":"Our server was Meaghan and she let us know when introducing herself that this was her first day (and her first shift!)...definitely appreciated the heads-up, but she was honestly great and I wouldn't have been able to tell. She was really sweet and checked in on us often. She even brought us an extra piece of soda bread when we asked! The soda bread is very authentic btw and I could eats loaves of it.   I ordered the Vegetable Curry and it had just a hint of curry spice while still being mild enough to eat a whole bowl of it. It was very warming and perfect for a cold day. It had big chunks of cauliflower in it, which added a nice texture.   Not a ton of vegetarian options on the menu, but I think that's pretty typical of pub food. And at least the curry is good!  We didn't order any drinks or anything, but I've heard they have good specials so we will probably be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The staff is very nice, the beer is very cold, and the food is fresh and affordable.  Great place to eat before or after a Knights game."}
{"text":"MUST VISIT ...didn't disappoint.....Love this place!  Had a fabulous dinner and great drinks. My husband had a Guinness 1/2 & 1/2 and a Guinness Blacksmith and I had a cucumber Tito's beverage that the bartender whipped up.  Both were excellent. The bartenders were super friendly and made us feel like we were locals. (We are from Tampa ). Jack pored the perfect beer, Melanie making great refreshing vodka drinks. Our dinner entrees were the Sirloin dinner that you could cut with a butter knife (props to Kevin the chef) and braised pork with veggies that were spectacular!!!!"}
{"text":"Was here last Saturday night - great little place with good beer, great food and nice staff.  The shepherds pie was excellent as were the pretzel bites.  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pub & grub.  Bistro style pub offerings with great atmosphere. We wanted to try everything on the menu but I guess this means a trip back."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Charlotte for Buisness meeting and took a walk to find lunch. The \"Murphy\" burger was perfect. The server \"Brooke\" was excellent. Felt like I was home not on a business trip."}
{"text":"A friend and I both Irishmen, had a few beers (Guinness) and the Shepards Pie. The pie was homemade, and delicious . I had a recommendation from a business associate who is a well travelled guy, who said the pie was the best he ever had.  It was excellent.  Brittany was our server and very nice.  Murph the owner came over and said hello.  If you like homemade food that tastes real and enjoy a good pint to go with it, Murphy's is a great choice. Will be back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went for lunch due to the $8 special on shepherds pie. I thought it was bland, but it was much bigger than expected. Many of the photos on here now are top-down so the crocks look shallow. They're not, they're pretty deep. Similarly, the pretzels look like fists. They're not, more like a silver dollar--much smaller than expected. Also ordered the beer cheese soup and the soup du jour, a mushroom bisque. Those were bowls, not cups, even though they are the small cup size. In the end stuffed, but not satisfied. At $30 for lunch ordering the daily special and no drinks, I just wished something was great. Service was fine and food was ok, but nothing that I'd be back for."}
{"text":"This place was in the same building as my Airbnb. Boy did I luck out! I had the Rueben with roasted veggies instead of fires and it was great. They had a decent draft beer selection, with quick service at the bar for a late lunch. There was trivia when I went back Thursday night and while I wasn't in the mood that day, love that it's an option if I'm ever back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cool spot near the ballpark.  Great afternoon $3 draft specials.  For dinner i had the Fried Cod Po'boy.  It was really good!  The slaw and tarter sauce combo definitely made it.  Above average fries as well.  For an appetizer, we had the Deviled scotch eggs.  It was an interesting and tasty dish.  A soft deviled egg in a crusty shell, with Old Bay sprinkled in.  Friendly wait staff and go say hello the the owner \"Murph\" at the bar.  Cool design and \"pub\" feel on the inside."}
{"text":"The Reuben is the best i ever had, and I'm from NJ.  Jack, the bartender, is fantastic.  We love Murphys."}
{"text":"Can't believe we have not been here before (been open for 4 months)!  This bar is legit, great beer selection and the menu looks great.  Proper Irish bar and food menu! If you want to support uptown CLT, check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem... Owner operated. They actually care about everything. It's clean, staff is friendly, food is not food service food but rather more like home cooking then most places. You can't go wrong stopping at Murphy's. If it's for a drink or a meal I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Murphy's is without a doubt one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. The food is excellent and Murph and his crew are friendly and inviting. The drink specials are really good on certain days of the week and I've never had a bad experience in there. I've tried most of the menu and I've only ever had one thing I didn't really like. The scotch eggs and the reubens are incredible. And the shepherd's pie fries - clearly not winning any health awards, but they're loaded with flavor. Definitely worth stopping by to check the place out!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here. We sat on the patio, so I didn't even venture inside but it looked pretty cozy. Started with the pretzel bites and mustard. They are more like everything bagel bites. Which is not a bad thing at all.   I ordered the Reuben, which was fine, but I wasn't impressed with. The corned beef was sliced and cooked really well. However, that's all I could taste. Needed more saurkraut and 1000 Island. Boyfriend got the lamb sandwich and loved it. I tasted it and wow- flavorful. The real star of the show here is the french fries. I don't know what kind of seasonings they put on them, but they are perfect. Went with another Yelpers tip and ordered a side of malt vinegar creme to dip them in. Great call.   Its a great addition to that part of Uptown, and since I can walk there I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Always a fan of an Irish bar. That isn't quite true. I'm always a fan of an Irish pub, which has a distinctly different feel. Murphy's is somewhere between the two. It's a bit more upscale than a pub, but it isn't quite a bar either, though you can certainly lay the blame on some of that on the clientele, so that can be forgiven.  One of the downfalls of the place is the location - if Charlotte were more of a walkable city, then this would not be a problem. But because it is not, there are not too many times where you can simply pop in for a drink or a bite. And that means that you have to get there, and that can be a challenge, unless you are already in the area (there are games, and you can park, and...). It's not horrible, it just is - and it is not just Murphy's, as most places Uptown have the same issue, but it's worth pointing out.  On the inside, the staff is friendly, but not overly so, and this could go either way. The problem is not that they are not helpful, because they are - when they are around. The problem is that they have a tendency to congregate around the front, except when you come in the door. Then they are nowhere to be found. It is a bit odd, really. Friendly, sure, but helpful? Probably not.  When it comes to food, the menu sounds amazing. Unfortunately it seems that they are trying a bit too hard. The boxties are tasty and the \"pretzels\" are good, but they are more like rolls than pretzels. The pudding had a decent flavor but really could have done with more texture rather than being quite so fancy. Everything just seemed to be more about substance than anything else. The good news is that the Guinness was a very nice pour.  All in all a solid visit if not a spectacular one."}
{"text":"Yassss!! I've been wanting to try this place for a while. We always pass by this place when going into or out of uptown. I was lucky enough to win a gift card here. We parked across the street and walked over. The restaurant downstairs isn't big but it's the perfect size. We got a high top table by the window and it was perfect.   We started off with the wings for an appetizer. They were HUGE and delicious. The flavor was good. We got buffalo. It wasn't spicy to me but tangy. I got the fish and chips as my meal and my husband got the stew. I loved the fish. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The fries were seasoned well. The tarter sauce gave it a good zest to it. My husband liked his stew. It was meaty and hearty. He ate the whole thing.   Service was friendly from the hostess, to the food runner to our server. I love this place. We will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and tey have some nice beers on tap.  The wait staff was not very attentive."}
{"text":"First restaurant we decided to try on our first trip to Charlotte. I was slightly disappointed. Paid for parking because parking definitely is an issue. The waitress was very friendly. Now as for the food.... Rueben sandwich and the ham and gruyere sandwiches are good, the fries they come with are also very tasty. Tossed in an herb/garlic mixture cooked perfectly. The pretzel bites are more like bread bites.... not bad but not pretzel. The loaded bowties are potato cakes with green onions bacon and a drizzle on them.... the potato cakes aren't made to order they're previously made cakes reheated with the toppings.... so definitely tasted like reheated leftovers. The cheddar and ale soup was my biggest disappointment.... warm yellow ale would be a better description.... the consistency was very thin and not much cheddar flavor. On the other hand the shepherd pie loaded fries were amazing.... the portions for all of our orders were great just wish the flavors were better."}
{"text":"Three words: Deviled Scotch Eggs. Brilliant. Just damn brilliant. Charlotte, please join me in a slow clap for Murph.   We started with those, the house made pretzels with stout mustard, and the loaded boxties (potato cakes with bacon, cheddar, chives, and malt vinegar creme). I got the wild salmon and leek quiche with sweet and sour cabbage. The boys went with sammies- ham & cheddar toastie and the shredded lamb. We also all got the cheddar and ale soup. Everything was delicious. I really loved all the apps. You could easily just make an evening with those and cocktails here.   Pro tip (from Murph's wife): get a side of the malt vinegar creme for your french fries. You're welcome in advance.   This is conveniently located near both the Knights and Panthers stadiums. Great place to grab eats and drinks before or after games. Don't commit to the pay lots immediately, drive around and see if you can snag a spot on the street. Meters are free after 6pm and on weekends. Love the decor. Two patios, including one upstairs.   I've known Murph for more than a decade. A longtime staple of Connolly's, he's a fan favorite in Charlotte. Great guy who works really hard. So proud of what he's done with Murphy's. Go support this place. Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to stop by to hang out or just relax after work.  Always busy but never too crowded and the food is AMAZING!  A nice new gem within walking distance to BB&T Park and Bank of America Stadium and with a super friendly staff."}
{"text":"We recently rented out the upstairs of Murphy's for dinner and drinks. Everyone had such a wonderful time! The Murphy's were really helpful in planning the event and accommodated everything we asked for! Jack was an amazing bartender and definitely helped to entertain our crowd! Amanda made sure all of our guests were happy and that we had everything we needed all night. She went out of her way to make our guests feel welcomed. I would definitely recommend Murphy's for a group party!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and I was so happy with my OMG Amber Ale.  Pretzels hot out of oven with hot mustard, Ruben sandwich, green beans instead of fries for people like me.  Angela Madsen's favorite scotch eggs since London 2012 and the Great Britain 2010 Ocean Row!  Murphy's is not to be missed!  Grab a bite whilst you are here in Charlotte.  I'll be getting some pretzels for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and nice selection of beers.  The ham and turkey croquettes are super yummy.  The menu is pretty limited and the sandwiches can be kinda greasy.  Great for a quick pop in to get a snack and drink with friends and a simple low key night out."}
{"text":"This place is a must-try if you are out in uptown Charlotte.  It's right near the baseball and football stadiums, which make it a great place to grab a bite on game day as well! There food is AMAZING! The chef here is totally on point! If you go, you HAVE to try the boxties...they are like change-your-life good! The scotch egg is another ridiculously good appetizer! I was impressed by literally everything here, from the food, to the service, to the amazing atmosphere/decor. I will be back again...and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!! Booked a table for St. Pat's weeks ago. Got a call last night, the night before St. Pat's, that they could not guarantee we would get a table and may just have to stand. They were expecting a large crowd-wow an irish bar is busy on St. Pat's-who would have thunk it?! That was why we made reservations!!!!!   **Update** just got a message from Cole-the owner inviting me to enjoy a comped meal to make up for the Open Table debacle. Great customer service and follow-up."}
{"text":"Needed a place for a beer and some food while stopping in Charlotte on my way to Tampa. Saw that Murphy's was open. I can't resist an Irish or English pub so I stopped in.  The only two things Irish to me was the menu and the name.  Food was authentic but the atmosphere wasn't. It was overly crowded and noisy. I was hoping to relax enjoy my beer and food and hear some good classic, maybe even live Irish music to unwind. But no, it was the regular noise that passes for music today.  They were out of Smithwicks, but had Harps so I made do. Couldn't decide what to order since every menu item was what I enjoy. I ordered my food, finished my beer, took it back to the hotel, put on some Dubliners and relaxed. Next time I'm passing through on my way to or from Tampa guess I'll just keep going."}
{"text":"Parking was a nightmare, as this location is in uptown Charlotte. Look for street parking, or if if available, you can park in Lot# 96501 on the corner of 4th and graham across the street after 5:30pm if there is no event parking. The Province Beef & Stout Hand Pies are ridiculously good! Beware though, not a huge appetizer. You get two small pies, enough for two people, that are jam packed with flavor. The tomato relish that they serve with the pies adds to the flavor combination perfectly. It has a cinnamon sweetness that just makes the delicious meat, stout, and spice of the pies pop. The Shredded Lab sandwich, also delivered a punch of flavor. The lamb is seasoned with a little spice and some cinnamon and it is paired with the salty yumminess of the feta cheese. It's finished off with pickled onions, arugula, and tomato jam. The petite farmhouse salad is a wonderful side choice. The shepherd's pie is pure comfort and served with some wonderfully crumbly bread. We also sampled the cheddar ale soup, which is rock-star. The cheese is perfectly flavored with a great ale flavor; the soup is both thick and creamy and makes a perfect accompaniment to any sammie. These folks certainly bring the spirit of Ireland into their food. My great compliments to chef! This may be a small menu, but it is fully of amazing flavor and taste."}
{"text":"This is a weekly lunch treat for my bf and I. Everything on the menu is phenomenal and extremely authentic. It is an incredible menu for both lunch and dinner if you are looking for great Irish food or just a great meal. Thanks for always providing great service and fantastic food."}
{"text":"My husband and I wandered in on MLK day around 2:30 and the place was pretty quiet. I enjoyed the decor and atmosphere of the spot immediately, and was excited to dive into some Irish fare. We both ordered the scotch deviled eggs and loved them! The hint of mustard was a nice touch on the deviled egg. My husband also got the pretzel bites and said they were tasty. I also ordered the root vegetable salad, and they had no problem keeping the onions out, which I appreciated! The salad was quite tasty, and the Caesar dressing was a nice touch. We will definitely be back to this place to try more menu items."}
{"text":"We have a place in the City of Boston called CHEERS. Walking into Murphy's Kitchen and Pub on W Trade St. Is just like or even better than. Murphy and Megan along with there crew are outstanding in service and the food is to die for.  Any day or night at Murphy's is worth a visit only to find yourself back again and again.  Even myself being from Boston now a permanent resident of Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The soups are surprisingly amazing and I've never been much of a soup lover.  I'm still working through the menu but the 8 to 10 dishes I have tried are all better than expected. Solid bar upstairs and plenty of service to keep you planted in the seat. Parking situation isn't great but what uptown place has any to be honest? Looking forward to trying the stuffed lamb."}
{"text":"Best \"Irish pub\" I've ever been to.  Have you met Murphy? He is the nicest guy. I love that you can sit behind the bar and be served a drink by the owner of the place. He has compassion and heart and you can tell in the way he runs his business. I love sitting behind the bar and chatting it up with the bartenders.  This is a great spot before or after Knights games. The other night we were there before and after the game, haha.  We had the pretzels with mustard and beer cheese, which come in small circles. They are good and different from other pretzels I have seen in town. We also got the scotch deviled eggs. I've never had anything like this, and they are delicious and a great staple for them. I ordered the Reuben with fries. There is a decent amount of meat, and it really is a great Reuben. The fries are sooooo good. Lastly, I finished with some salted caramel pudding. I didn't expect there to be much to this, but it was very yummy.  Seriously good food, great drinks, great location, and superb owner. What else could you want?! I love this place and continue to return!"}
{"text":"#1 on my 10 before the end of the year list. Murphy's seems like the type of place where locals hang out. I'm definitely going to have to return to get the full experience, but from my first dinner, this place was awesome. Parking is a little bit of an issue, but drive around a few blocks (not just ONE block) and you'll more than likely find *something*. As with most Irish restaurants, I knew I had to start off their Shepard's Pie. Their presentation is rustic and the taste is absolutely insane. Fluffiest mashed potatoes, awesomely savory meat and veg mixture... was by far one of the most well executed Shepard's Pies I've had. It was also served with a great soda bread that our waitress so kindly gave us more of. The menu is pretty meat-and-veg heavy, but even as a vegetarian, The Lady was able to easily find something in one of the curry dishes, which she adored.  Just as a note, special shout out to our waitress, Meaghan. It was her first day, first service and she did a fantastic job, so kudos to the training staff at Murphy's.   There are a ton of other things on the menu that I want to try out, and I kind of want to come on a busier night as well to experience the real ambiance of the place (it was pretty dead save for some Chiefs fans in there for the game the next day... yuck.) Yes, Nicki, I'll go back and try out the deviled eggs :)"}
{"text":"I will not be back! Let me just start by saying, we were shunned as soon as we entered this restaurant...maybe it was the thickness of my eyeglasses or the tone of my biracial daughter's skin but either way the hostess was as cold as ice around 4pm on Friday, 3/17/17! She had the audacity to stand for over a minute and just look at us with raised eyebrows, we had to ask to be seated and she responded that she had to check with someone to see if there were any tables available...hmmmm, you are the hostess of this establishment and you don't know if you have any open tables...wow just wow! Stick a fork in, I'm done! This level of blatant discrimination is hard to ignore! At this point, it doesn't really matter if everything else would have been perfect, the mood had been set and unfortunately, it just got worse! We were seated at the very back of the restaurant, our waitress was extremely inattentive and several people walked in after us and seated themselves at the bar and food prep area. Our waitress never checked on our drinks, we had to ask for refills and at one point, my daughter had to flag someone, down ask if they worked there then request a refill on her water. Food was just okay! We ordered the Sheperd's Pie Fries and yeh, meh...not bad but it didn't blow me away nor will I crave it for the next week. I want to make it perfectly clear, this restaurant was not crowded even if it was St. Patrick's Day and this is a highly recommended Irish Pub. Word to the wise, save your time, energy and money for a more deserving restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic Reuben paired with fantastic service equals a fantastic experience! Cocktails look cool too although I didn't try. Housemade ginger beer is always a winner. You should try this place!"}
{"text":"Great times with my sweet sweet peers. This is our favorite bar. The service is great and the staff is amazing!  Definitely stop in this cute little joint if you are in town. Shoutout to jack!!"}
{"text":"Guinness always tastes much better in Ireland than it does the states....unless you are at Murphy's.   Seriously, I have been to close to a hundred Irish Bars across the globe and this is the one I would pick for my last meal and my last drink. The food, the beer, the service, and just all around great place to meet people. #community  And kudos to Jack as one of THE BEST bartenders in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this place ... from their Scottish deviled eggs to their Shepherds pie. My husband and I came by for lunch and it wasn't a mistake at all. The ladies were very hospitable and the food was very tasty. It was all smiles upon this place on a Friday afternoon. Definitely recommend it!  Perfect pint of Guinness. And the fish and chips an eye catcher and belly fill up!  We def enjoyed it and will be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Me and my boyfriend are from PA and were looking for a late night place to eat and have a few drinks. We weren't disappointed. The atmosphere is great, the fish and chips were amazing and my Jameson drink strong! Lol my boyfriend got the grilled chicken sandwich and it was amazing as well. I love me an Irish pub and this place definitely exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"YAAASS!! Food is wonderfully delicious, service is great & their location is prime!  Best tip about this place: they have an outside patio both downstairs & upstairs - with TVs!!  btw this is the new Notre Dame game watch bar"}
{"text":"Went there for a quick bite before baseball game.  Reuben was very good and Guinness' were poured perfectly.  My friend had the fish and chips which he said were very good.    Great location and I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Murphy's is a great place! Please ignore the comments of Jeff H. He made these false comments after being asked to leave after he assaulted some of the female patrons. Charlotte watch out for this guy! Don't let him through the door of your establishment!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for awhile, ever since I heard that Murphy left Connoly's to start his own place. I wasn't disappointed. This bar and kitchen is a little off the beaten path if you are used to being directly downtown, however, it isn't too far to make the walk. It is very close to the baseball stadium.   The interior of the bar is nicely done. They have a really good menu. we had a party of 7, were immediately seated, and had great service. Its a Irish Pub, complete with genuine Irish ownership. Our waitress, Sophi, was from London, which added to the charm. The had great food, with selections you would expect, like Sheppard's Pie, Fish and Chips, etc. They also had a great beer and drink selection. I had Birdsong's Higher Ground IPA, they also had OMB and other local craft beer on tap. Not a massive selection, but enough to keep you from not feeling neglected if you want a local craft beer.  For the food, 4 of our party got the Fish and Chips, probably the best I've ever had. My wife got a pork shoulder, the pork was very tender, juicy, and a great taste. She loved it. Two others in the party got sandwiches, which were also very good.   I would say a great start for this new Irish Pub. Check it out and make sure to say hello to Murphy the owner, who should be around making sure the bar lives up to his name."}
{"text":"Taking the term \"Irish food\" to extraordinary heights!!  Love it!  The scotch eggs are a fantastic start. Murphys has The. Best. Reuben. Ever!!  The loaded boxties are a nice treat for a light appetite. And as a finale, don't forget the salted caramel pudding. It will change your life."}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks on my last night in Charlotte. I was expecting a generic Irish pub, so I was pleasantly surprised to see their cocktail menu. I ordered a Roe & Co. and a Hugo O'Conor.   To be honest I don't really remember the Roe & Co., but I definitely remember the Hugo. It had mezcal and tequila and had a very strong smoky pepper flavor which I loved...probably due to the bartender burning a giant jalapeño right on top of the drink. This dude loved fire! He burned something for every drink I saw him make. It wouldn't surprise me if he incorporates fire into serving beer."}
{"text":"Local hole in the wall. It's not uncommon to see Murphy behind the bar or chatting with other locals around. The food is great and anytime there have been issues it has been more then corrected. Favorite bar in charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for a bite to eat with a friend. Nice relaxed atmosphere with a mix of Irish and modern music in the background and lovely Irish decor. The owner Murph was from Ireland and made it a very authentic experience!  We shared the Scotch eggs, hand pies and ham and cheese toastie. All the food was fantastic - good food done well!  Loved it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great new spot, clean, food is pub style but well done. They pour a nice Guinness, staff is friendly, great spot before a knights game or drinks with friends. I'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"YES TO THE SHEPERD'S PIE!! Sorry, just had to get that out there.   This place is conveniently located near the baseball stadium and the the football stadium, so on any given Sunday this is a good place to stop by for a bite to eat. They have daily drink specials as well, which our waiter was happy to share with us as soon as we sat down.   For two people, the total was about $40 including two draft beers, deviled eggs (which were amazing by the way) and two entrees... That's a great price point for a Saturday night in the Uptown area. I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Charlotte. The food is amazing and the atmosphere fun. I come here every week and have never been disappointed."}
