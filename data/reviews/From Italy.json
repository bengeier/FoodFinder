{"text":"Oh yes delicious Pizza!  Everyone likes Pizza.  And  this place has it perfectly put together to give you the ultimate pizza experience! Local owned (which always is better) I tend to get the white Pizza with mushrooms and black olives.  They are quite generous with the toppings which is a plus! My family loves the traditional red sauce pizza which comes with a sauce on the side.  It's like a spicy marinara.  They go crazy for it!  Definitely try them out if you are a pizza fan."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is ballin. The pizza here is really good. Voted best pizza by 100.7's voters. You can sit down to eat in this place if you want. The sauce is really something special. Totally completes the pizza in my opinion. Crust is great. My biggest gripe with this place is they won't deliver to New Kensington. Even though it's like 3 miles away. The only way they'll deliver to New Kensington is if you are a business and not a residential customer."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery tonight. Supreme Italian and mushroom cheese steak hoagie. YUM! Speedy delivery and the food was still piping hot when it arrived. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys white pizza with tomatoes.  We've eaten white pizza from shops throughout the Allegheny Valley.  \"From Italy's\" white with extra tomato is by far the very best any of us have ever eaten, including the white from other shops in Pittsburgh and even out of state.  We just finished a XXL with extra tomato and yet my mouth is watering as I write this review.  Try it, you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here!  This little pizza place located in Springdale is a great place for take out. They have not been around for very long but they seemed to have gained lots of love very quickly! The menu consists of a lot of yummy choices. We ordered thin crust pizza with Tomatoes and onions which was so good!  The guys that worked there were very nice and helpful as well. I will definitely be back here to eat again!"}
{"text":"I would happily bump this to 5 but I'm saddened they won't simply deliver right across the bridge into mount Vernon.  La nova which is further down,  delivers here yet From Italy won't... Makes no sense to me.  We love from Italy pizza but I can't give it 5 stars when they won't realize they are losing business here in this area to La Nova which is even further down then they are,  a shame. If they'd deliver here,  easily 5 stars.  Edit: What will it take to get these guys to deliver across the bridge? The ride from Mount Vernon to From Italy is about 5 minutes,  I just can't understand why they don't want that business.  Just had them again the other day and I absolutely hate driving to this place when it is such a short delivery route for them."}
{"text":"Pizza was just like the voters of 100.7 said as it was voted best pizza from their listeners.   Order when you walk in. Then head upstairs where the second floors is equipped with enough seating for about 24 people.   It is set up for a large group, however, with long tables set up picnic style. It is equipped with a pool table and dartboard.   Pizza crust was crispy enough to hold all of the sauce and meat on the top without going limp.  Yum!  Ample parking and staff who are polite make for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The best pizza pie with 30 miles! Consistent, clean and delicious. In four years of ordering they've made one mistake..."}
