{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE! I have never had any frozen yogurt as tangy and refreshing as this and you cannot find it anywhere else - I've tried! My favorites are the pomegranate, blueberry and prickly pear yogurt flavors. And I always get mochi and blueberries on top. The blueberries don't ooze or freeze like other fruit and go with all flavors. I like this location even though I'm taking my chances with the flavor selection b/c I think they make it better than I do at the self-serve one in Old Scottsdale, even though they have a bigger flavor selection. I've NEVER had bad service or noticed any cleanliness issues. Easily 5 stars."}
{"text":"Obsessed. Like, I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place. Please make one in Arcadia! Pleeeaaassse."}
{"text":"Fabulous crepes and frozen yogurt.  While on vacation in AZ, I went to Ice Tango every day for a treat. The crepes are wonderful- perfectly prepared, and pretty to look at. Priced somewhere in the $5-$6 range for one with strawberries and nutella, this is what I'm accustomed to paying and it was well worth it. The strawberries were ripe and flavorful. They obviously take the time to chop them so you don't get any parts of the strawberry you wouldn't want to eat. I also loved the frozen yogurt- nice texture and interesting flavors.  Since I returned home (Philadelphia), I have not been able to find a place where I can get crepes that are nearly as good. Looking forward to the next AZ vacation!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The fruit is really fresh and the yogurt is great. I have been to Pink  Berry as well as other similar places in LA and find it better plus the crepes are amazing."}
{"text":"So, I would say I have never been a yogurt guy until I visited Ice Tango.  I found this lovely place thanks to yelp, back when it only had 3 reviews.  Since then, the great reviews have been mounting up and I have had the pleasure in visiting this place numerous times.  The place is very bright, full of life and energy.  The workers are very friendly and the first time I arrived the owner explained to me the greatness that is Ice Tango.  It is difficult for me to order anything but the Twangy Tart with it being so amazing and all.  All of the fruit toppings are fresh and never frozen.  Toping any desert and sometimes entrees with cereal is perfection in my mind.  So, when I saw that they had a vast array of cereals and fruits to rest upon my yogurt, I was in heaven.  But, I think the best toping has to be the mochi.  Mochi is like a cross between a marshmallow and gummy bear, awesome.  I have yet to try their crepes, but I look forward to that day.  The smoothies are very good as well. This place is definitely a place to visit, no doubt in my mind."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this business is now closed.  Giving them 5 stars for giving it a good try.  I was just there 1 week ago and (unbeknownst to me) had my last Twangy Tart.  Darn!"}
{"text":"Pretty Much Amazing, Please leave the cereal toppings for frozen custard, you gotta do the Twangy Tart with fresh fruit and MOchi! Its like REAL frozen yogurt, no, its not vanilla, its got the sourness of yogurt. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!"}
{"text":"I tried Ice Tango for the very first time yesterday and loved it! I was a HUGE fan of Golden Spoon and was convinced that nothing would be better than that fat free treat although I was WRONG! I tasted all 4 of the flovors although my faves were Twangy Tart and Pomegranite. No toppings although they all looked delcious. The small was a pretty large portion and very satisfying. The decor is cute (cereal bar and all) and the staff were really very nice and patient while I made my flavor selection.  I definitely say try it if you haven't already. I hate to admit it but I'm SO over Golden Spoon now."}
{"text":"I discovered the frozen yogurt craze this summer. It was a beautiful summer, where I lived only a little ways from LA and subsequently, from Yogurt Passion, which, if you ever get the chance to visit, is AMAZING. Thus, when I came to the realization that there were hardly any yogurt places here, I went through a period of depression....until....I did a yelp search and found Ice Tango!!! It was just as I could have possibly imagined anything that I could find in LA!! However, most of my opinions are comparing Ice Tango to the almighty Yogurt Passion...so pardon me if I'm not falling head-over-heels in love with this place.  Pros: -best plain yogurt flavor (Twangy tart) I've ever tried. There's this mysterious sweet, somewhat fruity flavor to it that I'm a little obsessed with. I've never been a fan of plain, but I guess now I am. -The peach flavor is also very good too, if you want a flavor recommendation. -All the fruit is fresh and tastes amazing. -If you sign up for their \"fan club\" online, you get emails with coupons.  Cons: -This is damn pricey yogurt. When I went to Yogurt Passion, I could pile up the biggest size cup with maybe 10oz of yogurt and 4 different types of fruit and it would ring up to be around $5. I come here and I can't even get toppings without paying and extra $0.75 for each and even with a cup of just yogurt, it costs more than $5. If they priced the same way as Yogurt Passion (and a ton of other LA yogurt chains) by the ounce, I would've said that Ice Tango was the best yogurt place I've been to in my life. Sadly, my wallet isn't big enough my college-student money on topping-less yogurt on a regular basis. -Passion fruit is gross! Don't get it no matter what you do! It will be the regret of your life, to exaggerate. It tastes...a little muddy. I would say that's a bad thing. - Those new fruitty sparklers? Yeah, I wouldn't recommend them, at least after trying the coconut lime. I'll give them another try in the near future, but until then, it's a thumbs down."}
{"text":"Ummm. . .I. . .don't. . .get. . .it. . .?   Can someone please explain to me how this place is any different from TCBY from the early 90's?  Besides the ridiculous trying-to-be-trendy-but-just-looking-cheap decor?  I went in Saturday afternoon and it was packed.  I got samples of their flavors, which are pretty limited to start with.  The custards were good.  The yogurts were ok.  I don't get the hype over the twangy tart, it tasted like plain yogurt to me, which in and of itself tastes like spoiled milk.  No thanks.  I wound up getting a Pinalada smoothie and quite frankly I make way better smoothies in my blender at home.  The pineapple tasted canned and there was hardly coconut or mango in it at all as listed on the menu.   Admittedly I didn't have a crepe, which I am a sucker for especially with Nutella, so I might be back in here for one.   So. . .what is it that sets this place apart?  They offer a few flavors of frozen yogurt. . .and. . .toppings. . .and. . .?  Is it just that I'm spoiled by all the incredible local ice cream parlors in Boston like JP Licks and Emack and Bolio's to even care about this place?  I just don't understand the draw, why anyone would drive so far for frozen yogurt.  Are there really no other options out here?  Sad."}
{"text":"Oh, Ice Tango... why do I love thee?  1. The small is freaking huge. I have a hard time imagining eating more.  2. The tart is surprisingly tart- and sooo very refreshing. What an awesome pick-me-up!  3. The fresh fruit additions are marvelous- my diced strawberries were so generously scooped into my cup that I had more strawberries than fro-yo at the end of my serving.  4. It is less than 3 miles from my new job. I may just make this a regular on-the-way-home treat. With so few calories involved, could you fault me?"}
{"text":"I stopped by on opening day to check out the whole tangy froyo thing. The lady behind the counter was really friendly and explained the whole concept to me and i tasted through some free samples before making my cup happen. The 'small' cup is ENORMOUS. it must be a solid pint, for real. My two favorites were the nutella soft ice cream (not fat free, and thus delicious) and the fat free coconut. I went for the coconut -pineapple swirl. I didn't like the pineapple at all. and while topping are fun, i'm really looking for the quality of the base product and have admit that this frozen yogurt was really icy and not creamy at all.   i don't know. I'm glad I got it 50% off  but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Peach yogurt with fresh kiwi on top - YUM! Perhaps I'm glad it's such a drive. If they open one close to me, I'll be dropping a lot of money here!"}
{"text":"I drove all the way here from central phoenix to see what everyone was talking about.  I must agree with just about everyone else and say that i really enjoyed Ice Tango.  I had the Twangy Tart with mango and kiwi and it was so tasty and refreshing.  I did sample the pomegranite and blueberry... just the right amount of tart and sweet.  I also tried some of my girlfriend's custard which was very good too.  I did not get a chance to try any crepe's but the next time I am in the area I will come by here for desert for sure."}
{"text":"Twangy tart + fresh mangoes = crazy delicious.   (Throwback to the adorable Andy Samberg :)  )  The twangy tart tastes like plain yogurt, which I never eat, but as a frozen yogurt it's delicious.  And it only has 22 calories per ounce??!!   Sounds to good to be true but that's the official word from their website.    Although they only post 3 sizes (small-med-large) there is actually also a kids size, which is 4 ounces.  88 calories well spent -- much better than a 100 calorie pack."}
{"text":"\"Ice Tango, how can I help you?\" \"Yes, good morning. Is this is a Pinkberry knockoff?\" \"Well, our products do have some similar-\" \"Great. What time are you open until tonight?\"  Well, this some time LA transplant says \"hoo f*#&ing ray\"! I hauled my tuchus all the way from Chandler to FLW and the 101 for some \"twangy tart\" yogurt and a gander at what I thought would be Phoenix's version of this Los Angeles staple.  For those of you who are not enlightened (in regards to tart yogurt), I'll tell you this. Pre- powder recipe scandal at Pinkberry, this yogurt closet on Santa Monica Blvd in West Hollywood had to install Disneyland like metal bars to control the 11pm yogurt fiending crowd. As if the hired bouncers were not enough. This was for two flavors of frozen yogurt.  The plain yogurt, which was my reason for being in NoSco, did have a similar taste, but sans the subtle but unquestionably present bitter aftertaste of the Pinkberry brand, which I now attribute to that crap powder they were using at P-berry. Ice Tango is all around Ice- Tasty. They also have multiple other flavors including mango (the flavor of the day today) and blueberry, which tickled my taste buds.  Besides the yogurt I ordered, I tasted their vanilla frozen custard. Yum. The Russian Hubster (husband/ gangster) convinced the owner to make us a crepe. Delicious- and this coming from a former creperista myself. It was the perfect consistency. Moist on the inside with the a hint of crisp toward the outside. Our heavenly confection was filled with Nutella, nuts, banana slices, and nougat. Upon tasting it, my big and burly cousin actually giggled. There was no other way to describe it, anyhow. Just picture a muscular New Yorker, still sporting the shades, giggling. With chocolate syrup gleaming on his lower lip.  Delicious.  Apparently they have a couple of locations opening around spring- one in SoSco and one in Paradise Valley.  Rob is still giggling.

{"text":"Damn! I've been beat to the punch... or to the frozen yogurt I should say! I suppose Alexander C. had an unfair advantage as he lives a block from the new Ice Tango location. ::Jealousy::  I have been a big fan of Ice Tango ever since I \"hauled by tuchas\" all the way to NoSco for a frozen dairy delight. Well, its still a haul, but a much shorter one. And still worth it. David really has found his niche in the community and we can all be thankful that it came in the form of delicious and nutritious probiotics.  This Ice Tango is much smaller than the first, but what a great location! When I went, they were still working on getting all of the ingredients for the savory crepes, so I had a lemon berry. Delicious. I also had a sample of the pineapple yogurt. Those flavors were meant to be together. I am salivating at the thought.  David strikes again. New locations coming soon..."}
{"text":"Lindsay was here First! It opened up yesterday!   Review to come...  Allright, after many requests, here it is. This new location of the much-loved Ice Tango is on the scene with a totally different look. They have expanded the flavor collection to encompass the original Twangy Tart, the new creamy tart (which apparently tastes like Pinkberry yogurt), a sorbet (desert pear I think) and a few other options. The fruit and various cereal toppings are out buffet-style and the customer is charged by weight.  I was there when it first opened. Everything looked fresh. I can't say I tried every flavor, so I can't comment on Sarah G's comment that the Twangy Tart was not the same. I did try the desert pear sorbet which, while being tasty, was seriously lacking some alcohol. It was screaming for a margarita glass. Some time when I have a girls' night, I am going to get some of this sorbet and blend it back at home with some tequila. I swirled the coconut and pineapple flavors and topped it with strawberries and backberries. It was divine.  The price right now is $0.36/oz, but David is working with that as to avoid sticker shock for his loyal clients who are used to the other pricing. It should be noted that this location does have crepes, custard, and shakes. Those are not self-serve.  I like the serve-yourself idea because it opens up all new possibilities. You could go plain, mix everything in the store, or anywhere in between. It felt more homey than mojo, which I think has a very corporate feel to it.  Congrats on the newest location. I'm sure good things are to come."}
{"text":"Custards and yogurt. This is located in a nice plaza in scottsdale, cute little posh store. I had strawberry yogurt... recommended by the clerk after having tried several flavors... and indeed it was delicious. I really liked everything except the PRICE!! I got two small yogurts, one with a topping, and it cost $7.40!!!! I would have been fine with it but the amount of yogurt I got was not that much. personally, I'd rather have gone to the super market and buy Breyers brand icecream and have a ton more left over to fulfill my sweet tooth for the week. Don't think I'll be back, unless I'm invited to go. It is, however, in the same plaza that Houstons, blue wasabi, humble pie, and other great restaruants are soo if you're on a date... this would probably be a cheaper yummier dessert."}
{"text":"* * * * * * * * * etc !! i can just keep adding stars !!!!   I have only had their yogurt, and their mojito shake, and I truly believe this is the BEST Dessert that comes frozen you will find in AZ!!  You MUST try it.   Dave, the owner/manager/everythinger is super nice, very friendly service.  And they are open till 10 EVERYDAY, even SUNDAY! you cant beat that !"}
{"text":"Wow my fellow yelpers...\"AMAZING!!\"???    You guys have been in AZ too long.  Sure, IT got the job done when my sweet tooth was screaming for satisfaction the other night, but \"amazing\" is reserved for the likes of Oregano's Bazookie, Ted Drew's frozen custard or my grandmothers peach pie.    Ice Tango...for me...not amazing.  Good, yes.  And in a good location.  And clean and the staff was nice.  But when I'm looking for dessert, \"twangy tart\" simply cant stand up to any kind of chocolate, which they had none of, at least in the frozen yogurt genre.    However, fresh, creative toppings and not TOO overly priced, especially for this McDonald and Scottsdale Rd location...I'll go again when I'm looking for something a little more healthy and a little less amazing."}
{"text":"I went there after dinner for a desert crepe. Ordered strawberry banana nutella. It's okay. I wish they had not sweetened the strawberry. It was also quite big, enough to share between 2 people.   If I go back, I will make sure I am not full, and have a sweet craving."}
{"text":"So my craving and curiosity finally over rode my laziness to truck to the north but let's say it was SO worth it!!  This place is not only like Pinkberry but in my humble opinion surpasses it! The Twangy fro-yo has the familiar tang but with a more creamy mouth feel and tangier intensity. They also offer WAY more toppings including cereal, fruit and jimmie's... while they have my beloved Fruity Pebbles and Mochi they also have loads of other items. Included cotton candy (looks like the candy Nerds but tastes like cotton candy).. very unique. Other fro-yo flavors include Pomegranate, Mango, Blueberry and of course the PB like Twangy.  We also tried the frozen custard.. oh yeah, good stuff as well though, I was loving my Twangy to much to even think about ordering it. We met the owner very handsome Dave Cha, super nice guy,  and knowledgeable about all things fro-yo. It was a treat to meet someone with such enthusiasm and genuine sincerity.. especially in that neck of the woods (North Scottsdale).   If you have a craving for the good stuff.. do yourself a favor and head to Ice Tango.. I really don't think you'll be disappointed. Hurry before the word gets out and there are lines out the door!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm such a frozen yogurt junkie! Ive been driving by Ice Tango daily waiting for the day they finally open. Well, its finally here.. they opened a few hours ago and there was just about a line out the door. I didn't realize how many fro-yo junkies were out there waiting, hoping and wishing they would open their newest location!   Tonight being there first night I have to tip my hat to Dave and family. They have managed to put out as good of a product as they have over at the North Scottsdale location. I had the twangy yogurt topped with Fruity Pebbles and mochi.. you know for me its all about textures and flavors. Something about the sweet tart yogurt up against the crunch of the pebbles and the soft chewiness of the mochi that just gets me going.   Ice Tango is truly a delight and I'm just so excited that they are only about a mile or so from the house. You guys just rock my world!"}
{"text":"Finally made the pilgrimage to the new location after dinner at Eddie's House. Well I have to say, lackluster. While I like the concept of self service the space is WAY TO SMALL for this type of concept! We could barely manage in and out. Sad because there were only a handful of people in there. Also the a/c must have been broken because it was so hot in there was unbearable.   While some of the flavors were good, coconut and creamy tart, the gelato was pretty bad. Tried the pistachio, should have known since it was coming from a soft serve machine. Tasted pasty and dull.   * FAT ASSES LIKE ME BEWARE* the cups are huge so its easy to over fill a cup just to make it look right. We as Americans have a real disconnect when it comes to food portions, ends up being really overindulgence and gluttony. So watch out.  I think Ill stick to the Hilton Village location where I can have a smaller size and feel good about the fewer flavors and toppings."}
{"text":"after reading all these reviews claiming that ice tango was sooo great it was almost better than the OG pinkberry.... the bf and i decided to give it a try after dining in the area one evening. and it was a crazy hot night - perfect for trying some yogurt.  and let's just say... we were sorely disappointed. was it tart? yes. but the consistency is SO icy, it really isn't much like yogurt. they DO have mochi, my fave topping, so that might have saved it for them. and they are pretty generous with the topping portions....except after hearing some ppl rant and rave about \"the hole\" that can form in the center of the yogurt - well i've NEVER had that problem at any yogurt place before... until ice tango. and the price is kinda deceptive - for a plain yogurt (and WHO DOES THAT???) the price looks cheap, but if you want ANY toppings, it costs $.75 for the 1st, $.50 for the 2nd, and then $.25 for the 3rd. now, i KNOW it does NOT cost that much to actually purchase and prepare those toppings.  sure, it's a tad bit cheaper, but i'm going to save myself the gas money and stick with what's close to my house (wildberri), and the much much cheaper socal yogurtworlds/lands. or even better yet, i'll just make my own (it's actually really easy)."}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews that came before mine, I had pretty high expectations for Ice Tango... I love tart flavors and I love frozen yogurt - I was pretty damn excited to finally make my way to NoSco to check this place out.  I went with my friend DeDe at around 11am on a Sunday... We worked up an appetite at yoga, and when I told her that I'd read amazing reviews about this place, and that it was supposedly similar to Pinkberry, she just had to try it too.  We walked in and were impressed to see such a clean, colorful little store.  I had no idea that they would offer cereal and crepes in addition to their special yogurt with a ton of toppings to choose from.  David was working that day and DeDe drilled him on the nutrition information.  It's all fat free and only 22 calories per ounce.  A small yogurt has approximately 130 calories before the toppings.  We tried the plain and pomegranate flavors and we both went with plain and added fresh fruit as a topper - YUM!  Ice Tango is my new favorite place in the valley.  If it were closer to me, I'd be there every day!  I almost drove 30 minutes out of my way to return to Ice Tango the next day... I thought that was a bit crazy, so I am drooling sitting here thinking about my next visit.    If you like tart tasting yogurt, go pay David a visit at Ice Tango - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm with Kelly W - My favorite Ice Tango combo is twangy tart with pomegranate and mochi, but the rest of their fresh fruit and other toppings are always tempting as well.   I was really sad when the original Ice Tango location closed a few months back, but luckily, I'm not too far from this Hilton Village location.  We decided stop in for our Ice Tango fix last night with our family friends.  I called ahead to make sure they were open (it was Easter Sunday) and sure enough, they were!  Everyone ordered their favorite combinations and we were one happy bunch.  Ready for the even more exciting news?  We learned that their Old Town location will be opening really soon!  And the new location will be self-serve if I understand correctly... exciting, yes - dangerous too... especially when I'm really trying to stay on the wedding diet!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not as much a fan of the self-serve concept afterall...  I think I prefer a serving size as I request it - not my amateur serving getting way too big since the fro-yo comes out way too fast and I'm not used to it!  And then you have to pay for it... 38 cents an ounce adds up!  I stopped back by and treated myself to some fro-yo last night.  I stayed awhile to do some work while I was there as well (since my power was out at home).  In listening to the other customers while I was there, it seemed like everyone was having similar experiences.  Regardless, it was good to see the place packed on a Tuesday night.  I guess I'm not the only Ice Tango lover in this town.  So, just to clarify - I still love the product and the friendly service and the delicious toppings, but I think I'm safer financially and diet wise, heading to the the other location!"}
{"text":"I'm not to sure about a lot of things, but one thing that I can positively say is that Ice Tango is the most kick ass yogurt place ever in AZ.  I first got addicted to Pinkberry and ever since then, I've been dying for that indescribable taste. Ice tango has that awesome unique flavor in its twangy yogurt and fruit.  I love it!  It is VERY recommended, and if you are sitting there thinking of going, STOP, don't even think, grab your keys and head on over there!!!!  For some of us, it is a little far, but believe me, it is SO worth it! And the hours make it so much easier, open till 10pm, come on! I LOVE YOU ICE TANGO!"}
{"text":"I was trying so damn hard to school these fools around here about PinkBerry/RedMango goodness and then bam- I happen to stumble in on Ice Tango.  It was like a force of nature that great day. I was searching for a place to hang before an appt and considered nearby Starbucks. But then, I see this place and ran inside screaming \"Are you like Pinkberry!?!\" The girls then gave me yummy samples and I was in heaven again.  My pic- the regular tangytart with carob chips and strawberries.  The next day I hit the north location after a day at the pool. My friend in tow, I turned her on to my discovery and FINALLY another Phx friend knew the pleasure I had been describing. I am thinking about pomegranate with pineapple right about now. Thank you Ice Tango!"}
{"text":"I drove 50 miles to check this place out and had a hard time finding it!  It's definitely not your typical frozen yogurt bar.  I tried a few of the flavors as well as the vanilla custard.  The best (and only reason I would come here) is the Twangy Tart! It's sour just like plain yogurt but with a hint of sweetness to cut the bite and a refreshing icy texture. It's insanely Delicious on it's own or paired with some fresh fruit.  They have a beautiful assortment of Fresh Fruit toppings but I felt their other toppings were lacking.  I decided on the Twangy Tart with strawberries (see picture)  I'm giving 5 stars  based on the unique plain yogurt flavor \"Twangy Tart\" and their Beautiful \"Fresh Fruit\" selection, I wish they were closer to me.  ETA: My Slogan  Once you try the Twang you'll be like Daaaaaang!  And Nothing else will ever be the same!"}
{"text":"The Original Twangy Tart that made my heart go Buck Wild ...............   Yeah, that was the Original Location also.......   This new one, not so much as a pitter patter.   They were having a Grand Opening special, all orders 50% off so that was cool.   It's Very Small and you Serve Yourself now, too bad the fruit wasn't looking very fresh.   The Twangy Tart was anything but.   Seriously it just tasted like plain milk, no twang.   The Creamy Blueberry, not so creamy but very tarty, almost in a pixie stix kinda away, actually that's exactly what it tasted like.   Sadly I don't think I'd come here again given the other options I have for frozen yogurt.   Sorry Ice Tango."}
{"text":"Very fun! A minimalist setting, Jetson chairs, tangerine/papaya colors on the wall, a great display of colorful toppings and cool green spoons for your yogurt.   Now for the yogurt - the new trend in yogurt is this tart, plain, healthy yogurt. They have it at Tango. I know it doesn't sound great, but have it a few times and this will be your standard. Tango has a nice assortment of toppings, you need to go with their fresh fruit - blueberries are my favorite - for a refreshing taste.   The two gents working last night were friendly, helpful and kick back casual."}
{"text":"I dunno if there is much I can say that hasn't already been said.    I went to Ice Tango for the first time last night and really liked it!  I tried the Twangy Tart (which tastes tart, just like real yogurt, only frozen) topped with fresh raspberries.  Very tasty!   I'm looking forward to going back and trying the green tea custard."}
{"text":"This location closed (Hilton Village) :( Sooo sad because Ice Tango is my favorite!"}
{"text":"This yogurt, is definitely the best yogurt of its kind. Its a true yogurt taste that doesn't leave a funny aftertaste like golden spoon or other yogurt stores. Its a healthy treat that most people enjoy. It is tart, but thats the point of yogurt. I don't recall cows producing sugar milk do you? no. Its great for all people. Twangy tart is definitely the best flavor!! I hope to see some new flavors soon.   Great job Dave and Suzie for making the best place is NoSco!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I jogged by Ice Tango today for 10th or 12th time in the past 3 weeks (well, I was headed over to the canal for my run, and while I was running as fast as I could, I'm pretty sure it looked like a gentle \"jog\" to the race fans up and down Scottsdale Road...but I digress:)  I again saw the same sign on the door that has been there for at least 3 weeks since I first noticed it...\"Closed today, will reopen tomorrow\"...tomorrow has never come!  I slowed my pace to a slow walk and looked into the dark, dank interior of Ice Tango...the machines are all dead...the counters have crap all over them...except where there's dust all over them...not even the glow from the from the cordless phone...it looks like the power is disconnected...  I hope it wasn't something I said..."}
{"text":"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Best yogurt place ever! This is what yogurt should be! This greek style frozen yogurt is healthier for you, and just as affordable as that sugar loaded junk TCBY feeds you!  The staff is a little young and customer service is not their thing, but the yogurt is worth the lack of smiles in the place!"}
{"text":"It tasted like Red Mango... or Pink Berry... or every other froyo place ever created from the hype.   Not bad I guess... it's a good alternative.  I also tried a crepe. It took forever for them to make. It was like they went out to pick a banana off a banana tree somewhere in the banana fields not before having to fight a monkey for the last banana. But before they finished making my banana and nutella crepe... they decided to clean and disinfect the battle wounds they suffered from fighting off the ferocious monkey, only to realize that the banana they took from the monkey was meant to feed the young monkeys so they felt bad and gave it back. Then they went down the street to safeway and bought a banana.  If that really happened... I guess it's acceptable for them to take as long as they did to make me my crepe."}
{"text":"'Tart yogurt with brownies, strawberries, and raspberries.. wait no, with pineapples, mmm.. with blueberries!' So many choices, and they're all good. This is why this place is so fun and starting to be one of my favorites. As I drove by one today, I couldn't help but think..' should I stop?!' even though I just had finished eating a big burrito.  Thanks to Lindsay and 'Little Hulk' I was encouraged to try their crepe(s) and wow! the crepe added one more reason to keep me coming back!"}
