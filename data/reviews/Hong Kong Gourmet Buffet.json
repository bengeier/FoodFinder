{"text":"Our family hadn't been here in a year or so, we were all disappointed. It has gone down hill, none of the food was fresh and it didn't have the same taste except for the chicken skewers. We used to enjoy this place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I meant to leave a review the last time I ate here this place is truly AWESOME!!! I had a great experience and the food I ate was tasty and there was a great variety. Best Buffett I have eaten at in a long time. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few buffets and this one was actually pretty decent in comparison to the ones I've been to. This one does have an okay sushi bar; the sushi is made to order rather than just sitting there, waiting for people to pick them up. There is quite a bit of food selection here. My favorite part of the buffet is the Mongolian stir fry just because I love my noodles made to order and their grill was one of the better ones in a buffet that was decent."}
{"text":"Way way overpriced. Just for myself and the drink was $19.95. That's like going out for a steak dinner. The buffet is nice the restaurant is nice. But way too expensive I could have maybe accepted $14.95 or even $15.95 but not $19.95! Too expensive for a buffet with a lot of the same things that you get at a very cheap Buffet. Your typical canned pudding and canned pineapple on the dessert buffet and a lot of the food was no better than the cheapest buffets I have eaten at. But on a good note I enjoyed my meal and they were very friendly. I'm going to have to save eating there are times when I have extra money and we'll have to maybe consider going to a steak house instead. But I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I have been several times and nope it sucks. Back to Panda. The meat taste strange, I mean real strange. The Mongolian no matter how much Soy Sauce a molecule can take its still bland. At least at YC's or even Genghis Grill you have options. You will find that there are several dishes that are decent and its all chicken...I hope..."}
{"text":"Apparently the same incident have been witnessed by another customer ( few days ago ). See customer review. Wherein the owner was also arguing : fighting with the customer.

This is exactly what the waiter and another restaurant worker was telling us - that the owner have a problem. 

I will not be surprise if one day there could be an incident here that will end up really bad,

This owner is a mental case. Reminds me of random shooting. Only to find out , way too late that the culprit have history of mental problem."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place.  We have been here a few times and it was very good for a buffet. Last night was horrific...Oysters were warm, the food wasn't fresh, most everything was dried out.  The prime rib was so tough I couldn't chew it! I asked for a glass to drink my beer from and the waitress refused to bring me one.  I will not go back and wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this buffet because it's really hard to find a good quality buffet that offers enough of what we like to make it worth it, and this place looked like it would hit the mark. 
Upside: I did enjoy the food, the only issue was that we were there kinda late at night and everything had obviously sitting out for awhile. We plan to go again earlier in the evening.
 Down side: The whole restaurant could use a very deep, heavy, all over clean. It's been awhile since we were actually there and now when I'm writing this review but I clearly remember thinking that the floor was so dark from grime or dirt that it was kind of off putting. The ceiling tiles were also starting to look a shade that they aren't supposed to and this is the only reason that I'm marking them down. 
Food itself? Very good. Restaurant the food lives in? Could use some work. Hopefully they take better care of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday, sushi was not good tasting, no crab legs were brought out. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Hmmm...I'm surprised that this place has only garnered 3 stars overall so far.  This is by far my favorite Chinese buffet in Phoenix.  I have not had any of the experiences noted from the above reviews....room temp sushi and greasy food.  The sushi has always been excellent in my opinion but I'm no sushi expert by any means. But it has never been \"room temp\" in my experience.  As for the food they are definitely well above average in my opinion. They make the best sweet and sour soup that I've ever tasted to date!!   The decor is very upscale and pleasant looking.  So far I've always found it very clean in appearance and have been very satisfied with every visit I made to this place."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on July 8.  There was no problem being seated right away.  The place is big and has ample seating.  Not much to say here except it is a typical Chinese buffet.  Food was good and there were plenty of choices.  The one plus here is that they have prime rib at dinner all the time.  They also have Mongolian bbq and fresh made to order sushi.  One of the better Chinese buffet places."}
{"text":"I went with my family at 4 oclock this Wednesday afternoon. For $15.99 a person, I would assume that the food would have been more fresh. It seemed as if all the food had been sitting for over an hour under the heated lamps getting soggy and slimy. I was not impressed with this visit at all~ our server was also not very visible even though we were the only family there. We ate over half our meals without any refills. Again, for $15.99 a person, I would rather bring my family to other nearby buffets that prepare fresh food and provide outstanding service. Barf."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. This best Chinese buffet I had here in Phoenix have sushi station and a stir fry station. Orange chicken n egg rolls were very good I really recommend  coming if u have kids they Tuesday night kids eat free. If you like Chinese food you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Walked into this buffet not knowing what to expect since I usually don't frequent buffets...pleasantly surprised!  Great variety of food and the seafood was surprisingly fresh and unique (think oysters, clams, crab, crawfish, etc.).  I had a little bit of everything and definitely enjoyed the egg drop soup (with extra doses of red chili sauce and mushrooms).  The buffet gets 4 * instead of 5 because the meat was definitely not \"quality\".  Will visit this place again!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, nice selection. The waitress forgot to bring our drinks at first, but it was a busy night. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent cream cheese won tons and fried rice. 

Sushi bar and custom wok station!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by my clients.  According to them they serve great food, always fresh and excellent service.  So I went with my co-workers last night and it was absolutely wonderful.  The foods were piping hot and the prime ribs were nicely done and juicy.  Sushi are made to order, sanitary and fresh.  I have high standards when it comes to buffet- this place absolutely made my top three favorite spot for food."}
{"text":"Horrible food!! Crab legs had a funny smell and weren't fresh. Definitely not worth $15.99. If you know what great food tastes like do not waist your money here: ("}
{"text":"It's OKAY, but not that great.  The hot food is reasonably warm, but not that warm.
The food is typically overcooked (or cooked long in advance and sitting in the warmer -- aka \"hot box\" -- for a long time), so not that great. 
The Egg Drop Soup is usually pretty hot, and normally has a fair amount of egg in it rather than being 95% liquid and 5% egg.

One of these days I will go back and try their \"mongolian grill\".  When you get your food direct from the grill, it's steaming hot, so I hope it will be close to what I am used to from the better quality ones I frequented before I moved to Chandler.

The service is hit-and-miss.  You either get a waitress who is very attentive (and therefore gets a far better tip) or you get someone who brings your drinks and MAYBE comes by once to collect dishes but not refill your beverages (and therefore receives a very small tip)."}
{"text":"I know there are some negative reviews but I have never experienced any of the issues other mentioned. Best Chinese buffet in town in my opinion. Always a great selection, food always fresh. All you can eat sushi on its own is worth the price of admission. Great and attentive staff. Can't wait til my next visit."}
{"text":"Food Was ok nothing special about this place .. Really expensive for Chinese buffet .. Drinks are extra so you ending paying 18 dollars per person .. Not worth it .. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Omg! Where do I start...

First of all, I really don't care for buffet's(Chinese especially). But, decided to give this place a try after seeing a delicious plate of crab legs posted by a friend of mine on facebook. It looked so fresh and tasty. I asked her about the place and tells me it is located in Chandler. So my husband and I decided to have dinner there yesterday. We get there and we're greeted nicely. The staff were nice and friendly which is probably the only plus side up. But, comes to the food.. 

Most of it was horrible! The crab legs that drew me in to go there which I couldn't wait to dig into..... was a TOTAL disappointment! Soggy and runny with water dripping out from everywhere. Tasteless! Not a firmness of texture anywhere! And the butter.... Not salty at all, it didn't even taste like butter. I don't know what it was. It just left a tasteless oily feel to my lips. And most of the food looked and taste like they been sitting out for hours. The only decent dish we had was the fried rice and beef with broccoli and eggrolls. Everything else was hardly fresh and not good tasting at all. And another disgusting dish that I saw that they served were frog legs. Gross!!! No thanks! I'm sure the same grease that they used to fry them things in is the same one they use to fry everything else. Disgusting! 

Lastly and overall, very expensive for low quality cold and old food! not to mention that their ceiling was very disgusting! Black dirty and filthy! Never again are we going back.."}
{"text":"Great food, sushi freshly , Mongolian grill in back, fresh seafood, well stocked bar, nice decor, friendly staff, wide selection, great prices, warm atmosphere, will be coming back often! Centrally located as well!"}
{"text":"Food was decent , not as hot as I'd like but wasn't bad for a lunch buffet. Would consider coming back"}
{"text":"This review is not in regards to the food. It was very good, I liked the egg rolls and the orange chicken tasted very authentic. Although, my boyfriend and I sat down and the server mentioned something we couldn't quite understand as we sat he came to mention how handsome my boyfriend was? Thanks but making a pass at my boyfriend with me there is not only rude but awkward. Then proceeded to say I have to say you are beautiful because I told him he is handsome. Well thanks for the not needed added comment. And for hurting my feelings."}
{"text":"I would beat sum this place up as mediocre. Everything is warm. Choice is so so. Service is nice. Just meh overall."}
{"text":"Great variety of food but mediocre. Taste less meet - the Mongolian beef , i didnt like the Cold See Food, steam rice is good. Sushi ok, Mongolian Grill good. 2 persons $26."}
{"text":"Don't really care for buffets for personal reasons but this one doesn't creep me out as much and the food also very good...the crabs legs bring me back:)"}
{"text":"Very Sad, very sad...  had been a regular customer for 20 years */- since they were in Mesa and then moved here in Ahwatukee many years ago.  Came at least once a month throughout those years...  They went through tough times - up and down like many others...  Hope they find their way out and back to get the restaurant up again.  Great food, great owner, great people...  We missed you!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. The selection was okay. The facilities were okay. Wife and I didn't feel the best for a few days after. 
It had been a long time since our last vista. Probably had forgotten why. Now it may be coming back to me. Kinda like the meal we just has."}
{"text":"This place was just half ass. $15 per person and it doesn't even include a drink is awful. They also don't RO their water and even a lemon couldn't make it taste right. The crab legs were tiny and didn't have much taste. NONE of the food was above 140 degrees as it should be. I had a plate of cold food every time. I'm surprised I didn't get sick. Such a waste of money. I will never go back and I will tell as many people as I can how awful it is."}
{"text":"I love the selection of food.  Almost everything was fresh.  I still can't belive they had pan fried noodles. My fav! My kids also loved the food.  You can tell because they all will be quiet.  Bout the only peace and quite my wife and I get.  Over all a really good buffet.  Pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My husband had a 3 inch metal skewer mixed in with his food. We were treated like we put it there ourselves by the manager when I brought it to his attention. He insisted that it did not come from their kitchen and that we must have put it there. 
Never have I felt more disrespected while trying to enjoy a meal with my family. We will not ever return to this place.
We left immediately after the incident and were charged in full for a meal that was never completed due to foreign objects in the food."}
{"text":"Still a good option for dinner and not as crowded on Friday as some other places."}
{"text":"We tried this place do to my looking up a place to eat while we were in the area, having our staycation at the Arizona Grand Resort
Hong Kong has to be the best Chinese Buffet I've ever been and I have eaten plenty. Everything was delicious.  We went for dinner so it was 15 and change for adults and our kids were 10 basically.   

The sushi bar was awesome. Instead of having a chef put out 5 or so different kinds of typical sushi. There is a chef making sushi to order. the menu to order off of is pretty extensive. 

My kids and had quite a few crab legs. The crab legs were also not your typical buffet grade. They were cooked perfectly and the meat was easy to remove and there was a lot of it.

we didn't try the Mongolian BBq but, we be back."}
{"text":"Great staff, great service, great food selection, and even greater quality. Will definitely be coming back when im back in the greater chandler area metropolitan."}
{"text":"Not surprised that this place wasn't impressive. The food was cold or dry and stale. The salmon sushi had a weird taste to it. The variety of offerings is good but the quality is just lacking."}
{"text":"This place was ok....kind of small for a buffet. The prices are decent, but, for the little amount of food that they offer, it's best to take your money elsewhere. Try Golden Corral or maybe hibachi. I've given both of them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good buffet, let alone a good Chinese buffet.  With buffets popping up in every abandon gas station, empty clothes store or just a shell of a building you can understand my wife and I being somewhat reluctant. This place is very nice on the inside.  Full bar, a Mongolian cook station and a sushi bar as well, although we did not partake in any of these.  The buffet was ok, nothing spectacular.  Between the spicy chicken feet, beef tendon and cook pigs feet, Andrew Zimmer would of had a blast here.  We tried a little bit of several of the dishes.  My favorites were the Thai Calamari (cold octopus salad) and the little neck clams.  The cold mussels were a little off-putting, I would avoid.  The spicy chicken feet, very bland, not spicy at all.  The beef tendon was different.  Chewy as expected but it did have good flavor.  I am not so sure that anything really jumped out at my wife as \"OMG good\".  The deep fried calamari was very greasy as were the crab puffs (crab rangoon).  One thing I did like was the fact that the egg rolls were normal size and not the mini egg rolls you see so often on buffets, however, these too were a little greasy.  The service was great and the waitress was very attentive.  I would like to try this place for dinner before I say where or not we will or will not go back."}
{"text":"A great Asian buffet. They have a sushi chef in the middle ready to make any kind of sushi roll on the spot. They even offer brown rice options too. (Although my brown rice california rolls were a little harder than I would like)

They have your typical Chinese food options like Orange chicken, crab puffs, string beans, lo-mein etc... There's a hibachi corner as well where you can make your own plates of stir-fry. 

The dessert here is much better than Pacific buffet in Chandler. They have a chocolate mousse cake that was really yummy. I don't think they're homemade but still didn't taste old like other buffet places I've been to. 

There's a bar as well but I didn't order any alcoholic beverages. 

My husband loved the crab legs which are always a customer favorite so you have to keep an eye out for them.

I would say they refresh the buffet items fairly quickly. I checked in on Yelp and even got a $5off discount!

Average dinner price is $16-$17."}
{"text":"Worst buffet I've ever been to! 

Decided to dine here after seeing how well presented the food seemed to be displayed. 

The price is a little more than most buffets around the area at $15.99 per person for dinner and an additional $1.99 for a drink since it is not included. I did not mind the price one bit since like I said the food seemed to be well displayed making it look appetizing. 

We started out at the Mongolian grill. Donner had started 20 minutes prior and already they were out of bell peppers, zucchini, and broccoli. Our Mongolian was bland even though we added a bowl full of sauce due to the cook pouring too much water once on the grill.

We moved onto the food. As I mentioned dinner had started 20 minutes prior to our arrival and the food options tasted as bought they had been sitting out for a while. 

The rice was bland and noodles were starting to dry out. 
Although I was hoping to have a great experience here, it was not the case and I was bummed. 

There are so many options for Chinese buffets here in The valley this place does not make the cut to even attempt to try a second time."}
{"text":"Well I had lunch here today and this place earned a solid 4 stars and was very close to 5. All the food I ate was real good and there was was lots to choose from that was not your typical Chinese buffet items.They had halibut in a garlic sauce {yummm} , and there was some kind of seafood and egg dish that was real good.There was bok choy which should be at all Chinese buffets but is only seen at a few. The desserts were typical except for fresh strawberries which I love and there Chinese donuts are second to none. Yay I am a fan and look forward to returning. Two thumbs up for Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet."}
{"text":"I drove all the way from North Phoenix to try this place and I wasn't disappointed. It's a pretty decent sized buffet for starters which is always a good thing. Options are a must when it comes to buffets. 
Service is good and the place is clean and well kept! 
I didn't get to try the sushi, but I did see they have it made to order, there's also a hibachi grill as well, plenty of really good dishes to pick from. Everything was hot when I got it from the buffet. All in all a pretty good place, I wanna go back for dinner because it looks like they have even more options :o"}
{"text":"I don't know why, for whatever reason, every year of my birthday I end up going to this restaurant.  I vote this is the best Asian buffet in town. Everything is fresh and sushi are made per order to keep them fresh. I stay and eat straight for 2.5-3 hours every time I visit.  As typical Asian restaurant, regardless their service, as long as the food is fresh, good quality, and the price is right ...then that is yr best choice. 

In addition, sometimes they have real crab sashimi and snail.  In the sushi bar, they have squid (my favorite).  The ingredient in the hot and sour soup is great.  Wonton soup come with wonton.  The oyster always fresh, I have at least half a dozen. There are so much food, always feel bad that I don't have enough room in my stomach to fit the stir fry noodles..lol"}
{"text":"This is our favorite buffet. We come here whenever we can. The food is always fresh ava they gave toons to choose from. We don't eat sushi but we took my niece and she loved that it was a option. My husband and I both like that we can go get noodles with whatever mix ins we want acc have it made there in front of us. It's also nice my kids are still young enough that they eat either free or very cheap (since they don't really eat much or often just take a few bites off my plate it's nice that is not so expensive for them) the servers are usually nice, not always the most attentive...It depends on what time of day or day of the week you go. But deff one of our fave spots!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet for over a decade. Disregard my previous review about this place.

In the past year, I've eaten here 4 times. All four times because of proximity and because one of my daughters likes their shrimp tempura and frog legs.

Their food has been on a steady decline. I haven't said anything about it, until now. Their food just looks like its been sitting there all day. 

Tonight, we went there and they had shut down one of their hot food sections for repair. They put a sign up that they moved the food they would have normally had there to another spot. It doesn't make sense. You're probably wondering if they adjusted the prices accordingly. The answer is \"No.\" 

We took our time eating and talking. They refilled the shrimp tempura one time. They didn't even have any and pepper shrimp. They didn't have oysters. Their crabs were anemic and looked tiny.

On top of all that, our waitress added an extra drink to our bill. I chalked it up to the language barrier. I was being cool about it until the guy in charge called the waitress over (before I could finish explaining what happened). She said that my daughter ordered a soda. She seemed to be agitated and was protecting a bit of attitude, as if she were blaming me for the mistake. 

Things could have unfolded smoother if the guy in charge just listened to my explanation right off the bat, instead of trying to get an explanation from the waitress.

I did NOT leave a tip, and I will not be returning to this establishment. 

------------------------------------------------------

Here's my explanation for what happened with the drink:

We got there. I ordered a Sierra Mist. My two daughters ordered water. 

I drank my Sierra Mist and got up to get food. I asked my daughter to tell the waitress I needed a refill of Sierra Mist if she came back before I got there. Before I got back, the waitress came by and accidentally filled my glass with water. My daughter told her that I needed a refill of Sierra Mist, and she brought one over and charged me. It was a simple mistake that neither the waitress and the guy in charge couldn't comprehend. (Mostly because they refuse to really listen to my initial explanation.)

Next time, I will be taking my business to either Pacific Seafood Buffet or Jogoya."}
{"text":"This is a great Asian buffet. I don't come to places like this expecting haute cuisine and I didn't find it. However, I was surprised at the variety of entrees and by how fresh everything looked and tasted. The best time to go is during the week for lunch. The buffet is $8.99 and you get unlimited sushi made to order by a sushi chef, build-your-own Mongolian stir fry, and six buffet stations of various Asian dishes. I love Asian noodles and their three varieties were delicious. I especially loved the duck noodles. Don't leave without trying the green beans.

Additionally, you can observe the Native Phoenician in his natural habitat. Marvel as the gargantuan beast waddles toward the buffet line with two plates in each hand. Legend says that a Phoenician can eat three times his own body weight in one sitting. This is a great place to test the theory."}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this place so my family decided one Saturday to venture here instead of our usual. 

We were...disappointed to say the least.

Well, first of all the restaurant itself was very clean, which was nice. And the service was okay. I mean it is a buffet though.

There was not a lot of choices like I'm used to. Which sucked because the price of this place is only less than my regular buffet and they have sooooo many more choices. But I'm giving them 2 stars since some of the food I had were decent in flavor so they didn't totally suck. The sushi station, I did not like because you have to order every time you want something. And when you did, the pieces were so tiny! It's like they are conserving the fish..definitely dissatisfied with that. 

At this point, really can't remember much except for great disappointment with this place.

Definitely will stick to my regular buffet."}
{"text":"Love this place. Clean everywhere. Nice staff. Food really great too! Have feshly prepared sushi rolls, Mongolian grill with lots of choices and a great selection of other foods."}
{"text":"Although there were plenty of options to choose from, some of the selections were cold on arrival. My wife enjoyed the sushi bar which is made fresh for you, however the fried rice and noodles were cold. Also the little chips that go into the egg drop soup were stale as well. Overall 3 stars for prompt seating, wide selection to choose from, and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This seems ok for sushi as they are making it in front of you, at least the one time I was there.  This place charges much more than the Mesa location, and they hover over you to make sure you tip them?  I will tip on service but if I want to get my drink, let me make the choice.  Am I supposed to tip on the appearance of a classier restaurant.  Not if the food isn't better.  I didn't care for the pretentious snobby attitude just to be charged too much for a buffet.  The drinks are an additional charge on top of the buffet cost, too if I recall correctly.  What's that about?  Maybe the clientele appear a little more normal than the Mesa location, but I can just eat what I want without the urge to get my $20 worth and stuff myself.  I'll drive to Mesa and enjoy my food.  Even with all the inbreds."}
{"text":"The sushi bar saves this place.  Evening prices are a bit steep.  Buffet is always well stocked and the area is kept very clean.  The food on buffet is marginal - not great but not dog food by any means.  Pretty big selection on most items.  Wait staff for drinks are not the best and dont wipe tables off as they remove dishes which is a turnoff.  Overall - decent place that I will go back to."}
{"text":"last time i was here which was a while back, the crab had a funny smell like ammonia. thank goodness i didn't eat it, because when i googled it, that happens when shellfish is spoiled. when i brought it to the servers attention, he just shrugged it off. have not gone back here since. there are other places way better in the East Valley for Asian buffet."}
{"text":"Customer service is okay. Food is alright. The oysters are always low on supply. Crab legs are okay, not so great. Better than Crazy Buffet's crab legs though. They do have a stir fry area and a sushi bar. I think sushi bar could be the best option or worse option for some people. I like variety and when getting a plate of sushi its kind of hard to finish it, but you know it hasn't been sitting there for awhile. They have raised their dinner price, so I'm not sure if its really worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Good overall buffet with lots of variety. Sushi, Chinese, Mongolian bbq, salad, fruit and deserts. Pretty large buffet at a decent value."}
{"text":"It's not the best restaurant that I've ever been to but for a Chinese buffet it gets Four to 5 stars very clean good food I will be back.very friendly service and the management came by to check on me which is a big big plus for me."}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Need I say more? Oh and I called to warn the owners and they didn't care at all and I still paid for my meal."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Friendly staff! I didn't even make it to the desert which I usually do because I just couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"Cleaned and nice but everyone at the table agreed the food was not even warm.  Stir fry is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Despite being an Asian buffet in almost the middle of nowhere, the food was surprisingly very good (supported by my Taiwanse born and raised grandpa). Would definitely go back there again if I was in the area. Didn't try the mongolian bbq or the sushi bar."}
{"text":"If you ever needed ANOTHER reason not to eat at Hong Kong Buffet at Chandler and 48th St, I've got one for you. My husband went there today at 12:30 for lunch with our 1 year old daughter. 
He got his food and sat down just to notice that none of the food was hot. It was barely room temperature. He advised the waitress of this who got the manager. The manager proceeded to berate him about taking food he wasn't going to eat. My husband explained he wasn't going to pay for food that wasn't fresh or stored at a proper, safe temperature. The manager became angry and followed my husband out of the restaurant where he then called my husband derogatory names, using expletives. 
It is not surprising they didn't pass their health inspection, and it's not surprising that they were nearly empty in the middle of peak lunch hours. Don't want food poisoning? Don't go to Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"Dont expect a gourmet dinner but that is not why you go to a place like this. Nothing fancy but alot of variety. This is the best of the Chinese buffets. At dinner they have salmon, tuna, and Hamachi sashimi. Also have char-siu ribs and snow crab legs. The kids like the dessert bar."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place to go, they have a fresh sushi bar, they make fresh noodle plates where you pick your stuff and they stir fry it right in front of you. They always have prime rib and ribs and crab. The tempura is my favorite, it's always fresh and crunchy.  You do have to tip the sushi and stir fry cooks, but with all the food included in the price I'm always happy to pay the extra bucks for fresh sushi and noodles. They have a full bar as well. The hostess is always nice, the drinks are always refilled promptly. Good place to go if you want more variety."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  It can be whatever you want it to be.

I've been there and had nothing but tofu, salad, edamame, and sushi.  And I've been there other times and got my fill of the standard heart attack items as well.  It's a $10 buffet so don't expect the world when it comes to flavor, but I've tried most of the dishes and they're passable.  I generally don't go to buffets since I like quality over quantity but this one is the exception, especially since I can get as much sushi and tofu as I want."}
{"text":"Summary: every dish, and I mean every dish tasted like it was under a heat lamp for 6 hours. I expected much more. They had a great selection of sushi, classic Chinese dishes, stir fry counter, and extensive seafood bar. It is a shame that all were so bland. I will not be back."}
{"text":"So this one tops King's Buffet for us! A tiny bit pricier because the $8.99 doesn't include drinks like King's does but TOTALLY worth it! And yes, their teriyaki chicken is better than King's too!!

We (my husband, daughter, and I) met up with Rand H. and Mike C. for lunch today and it was a great choice! So much variety and everything was fresh and steaming. Service was awesome and the right amount of helpful, not in your face but there when you needed it. 

My only complaint was the fried rice, they only had shrimp fried rice out today and I'm allergic to shrimp so I had to pass. My husband loved everything he tried except the sweet and sour chicken, it tasted a tad bit bland to him but I thought it was fine. Not spectacular like everything else but still great. My daughter ate everything we offered her (not typical lately!) and was delighted with the beautiful fresh plump grapes they had available. I believe she also stole my husband's chinese donut and loved it too. 

By the way, this 5-star rating may just be the first one I've handed out to date so congrats to you Hong Kong Gourmet! And thank you for the awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of buffets namely because it's not conducive if you're on a diet, and I'm not a big eater. So a buffet would be a waste to me since the price I'd be paying would not be worth it. With Hong Kong gourmet it isn't that much of a waste because of what they offer. I believe it's $14 for dinner which includes the buffet, sushi bar, and mongolian grill. If you want to load up on seafood then the price you paid is worth it and surpasses that. 

I enjoyed being able to get some stir-fried squid, tilapia, and scallops, and some sushi altho mediocre was sufficient enough for a seafood feast. I like the selection and you know it has to be good enough when half the customers are Asian so that has to count for something. 

The dessert bar is eh altho it's nice that there's a fresh fruit alternative complete with lychees and some other tropical fruit that I'm not sure of but tastes good. Anyways, if you're looking for a good Chinese buffet this is not bad, it's good enough!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not much of a variety. Definitely not worth the 40 bucks I spent on 2 people.  Service was eh, I had to wave down my server to get my drink refilled."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for an Asian buffet, this is probably the best option in the Ahwatukee/Chandler area. It's definitely not cheap but if you take advantage of the sushi, it's worth it. The buffet foods are pretty good. Even the standard options like orange chicken are above average. The staff is usually pretty friendly and do a good job keeping drinks filled."}
{"text":"They always have great food. A little on the pricy side, but it's quality food. .. all you can eat.  The custom Sushi Bar is excellent."}
{"text":"We love this place, been going here for years, gonna hit it up today as a matter of fact!  We have had several bday family gatherings here and the food is good, the staff are nice and the price is right.  I love their Peking Duck and walnut shrimp, but they are usually only available for dinner and on the weekends at an increased price, so that kind of sucks, but the fresh sushi bar is well worth the price every time."}
{"text":"From the mitten and love Asian buffets!! This one is the best I have ever been to!! I will be making a special trip back for Hong Kong Buffet.
The selection was great, quality was better then most buffets.. More like I would have purchased a plate of their food at a normal sit down and would have been very happy.. They had more exotic (to my American palate) odd foods like beef tendon! And it looked and smelled good.. Didn't try cause I'm a sissy and was just getting over being sick.. 
Lunch runs $10 dinner was $16
They have a sushi bar and a stir fry counter both maned and made to order.."}
{"text":"The family was in the mood to try a different Chinese buffet so after a little bit of searching on Yelp, we found this place.

We were a little bit nervous about trying this place because honestly, it can be a little bit of a gamble choosing a Chinese buffet in the valley but we decided to go for it and do the 45 minute drive. 

We found the restaurant easily and were super pleased to find they were very clean (none of that ICK factor)  and the servers were attentive and polite. They have fun seafood dishes and although they have nice looking sashimi and some cooked rolls already out, they also allow you to order sushi rolls (from a menu) that are made to order. They also have a mongolian BBQ type section but we decided to save it for another time. 

Our server was a weeeee bit slow on taking the dirty plates but he rocked on the drinks and had a great attitude, very friendly. 

Despite the drive, we're already looking forward to coming here again :)"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place.  I tried this place many years ago and it used to be pretty good. Definitely gone down hill."}
{"text":"Overly priced, mediocre food. 

Save your $15.99 for food and $1.99 for drinks. Our server was attentive, super nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Just opened PEONY GARDEN BUFFET  IN THE OLD HONG KONG BUFFET LOCATION. This place is a refreshing change from typical Chinese buffets. A must try!New restaurant opened in same location partially refurbished. Very clean and excellent food presentation. No crab legs yet but spiced crabs are off the chart. This is the king of quality and flavor. It  is the best of all buffets. Everything is worth the price if you want a cut above all the restPeony Garden Buffet. Very high quality food being presented. Each dish has its unique taste and the chef is off the charts excellent for a Chinese buffet. Never expected to come to the new restaurant and get excellent dishes above and beyond typical buffet. Best spare ribs in Arizona hands down ! Now this chef cooks a mean coconut shrimp that crunches. Damn good stuff. 
All meat no fat cooked to perfection on any of the meat dishes. Every dish we tried was excellent. The manager manages to give the customers what they want. Th food here was fresh hot and bursting with flavor. Compliments to the chef. Outstanding for buffet style. No equal in arizona"}
{"text":"My favorite place. They have so many options you're guaranteed to find something you like. I recommend the sweet pork ribs- so delicious! You can also make your own sushi rolls and chow mien stir fry, all included in the price of your buffet. Unlimited crab legs, and tons of savory Chinese classics. Also love the staff there, Vicky is my favorite waitress. If you become a regular, they'll welcome you by name and always remember your drink. They make it a really fun experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! This is not the same one that I used to go to 10 years ago!! Qaulity of food went down the drain! They are extremely cheap with sushi at the sushi bar! The food is sitting! Crab legs just a handful laying there!! If your going to reduce your Qaulity then reduce your price!!! Paid $17.00 plus tips , and prime rib was dry and just took a bite. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"For years this was my families favorite restaurant and we ate there at least once a month. The ambiance wasn't the least bit fancy, but the food was great, we've never found a Mongolian grill we've liked better, and the price was fair.  It was a sad day indeed when we learned they would be closing and relocating. 

Due to the distance of the new location we never made the 40 mile trip until last night. All I can say is that although the building is much nicer than the old this is NOT the restaurant I remember it being. To begin with I noticed that there were hardly any other customers- the place was almost deserted. I then noticed the price for dinner was $16.00 per adult and this did not include drinks. The Mongolian grill was good- almost exactly as I remember it, except the chicken which used to be very lean was extremely fatty and unappetizing. The buffet items had obviously been sitting around untouched for hours as  most had developed the tell-tale skim and sogginess. Of course everything tasted soggy and bland. The soup of which I used  to eat several bowls per visit was tasteless. The prime rib was all right, but nothing to brag about and hardly worth the huge jump in dinner price. The  lemonade my husband ordered tasted mostly of water and was obviously out of syrup. The service was fair, but not really that attentive- drinks were never refreshed and the waitress came only once to clear plates. The bill for two eight year-olds, One senior, and three adults came to a staggering $99.00! This covered only the buffet and soft drinks- no alcohol. 

  I would be willing to give this place another try for lunch- the price is only $10.00 and the Mongolian grill by itself is worth it, but there is absolutely no way I will ever come again for dinner nor do I recommend dinner here to anyone else. As I said, we used to be regular frequent customers- but not anymore."}
{"text":"First of all, I want to start by mentioning how CLEAN this place was. It smelled good when we walked in and nothing was sticky. For anyone who regulars Chinese buffets, you know what I mean. Even the bathroom was clean! 

The waitstaff was amazingly attentive and very friendly. 
They had a great oldies radio station playing which was a nice change from most restaurants in general.
I also liked how the seating was sectioned off so it felt like more of a private dining experience compared to the usual hogs at the trough buffet dining experience.

The food: YUM!
They have Coca Cola products - Win! I hate Pepsi.
There is a sushi section where they will make you as much fresh sushi as you desire. There is a tip jar and I found I was given a little higher level of attention than those around me after tossing in some extra cash. Pro tip: bring cash to tip the sushi guy! 
There is also a fresh hibachi grill tucked away in the corner. I had already filled my plate before I noticed it - something to try next time!
Second pro tip: there is NOT a section of pizza, chicken strips and mac n cheese for those picky eaters in your family. There IS, however, prime rib, frog legs, clams, crab legs, amazing orange chicken (and I'm not usually a fan), shrimp tempura, and endless delicious options.
There appeared to be a fully stocked bar and a few beers on tap - something to also remember for next time.

This place is definitely worth a try and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of our all time favorite family restaurants.  The selection is fantastic and all the food is high quality.  All you can eat Asian food, sushi and Mongolian BBQ, plus desert,....how can you beat that?  Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Nothing gourmet here, greasy fried food. Barely any crab legs.I didn't eat much and I kept throwing good away cause it was nasty. Save your money and go elsewhere.

Not going there again"}
{"text":"in town for some business and looked at what was available right near the hotel...nice selection...clean"}
{"text":"I'll be generous and give it 2.5 stars. Food OK (far from great) Removal of dishes and water refills slow. Lunch price as high as dinner prices are here in the Northeast and we got better food."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I gave my rating based on other buffets. This one is amazing! They have raw oysters, delicious sashimi, crab puffs, all the classic dishes and even a Mongolian BBQ station. This place is also extremely clean! It blows pretty much all other buffets I've been to out of the water. 

On top of all the wonderful food they have a full bar. I think they display the beer so you'll drink that and eat less. Sorry suckers, I'm not falling for it. This isn't my first time at the rodeo! I like beer just as much as the next girl but I'm saving the prime stomach real estate for FOOD and lots of it! 

I heard family night was on Tuesday and read that children under 11 eat free after 5pm. If you're a single/unmarried/childless adult I would probably stay away from this night. I read a review once where someone praised a buffet because their children got to run around and release their energy instead of being couped up in a booth. I did see a little bit of this happening at HK but nothing major however it wasn't family night to BEWARE! 

Also, you can't use the handy little yelp coupon on family night which isn't fair to those of us who don't receive a discount from that promo but oh well. Moral of the story is don't go on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Eh
18$ for dinner
all you can eat

The chinese food was pretty good.  Standard greasy chinese.  Mmmm.

They have a sushi bar, and the sushi was AWFUL.  I don't even know why I tried it.  

So yeah, eh"}
{"text":"We went for crab and sushi...6'1, 200lbs teen can put away a lot of food. So not worth it...sushi is billed as order and made fresh, we that's true, but all rolls are full D with fake crab salad, no matter what you order and none tasted fresh. The crab legs had boiled for so long that shells were mush and crab tasteless. I would only give one star, but must admit our waitress was attentive and polite, restrooms clean."}
{"text":"Man, this buffet is hella delicious.  Compared to some of the other Arizona/Phoenix-y area asian buffets I tried out the last two years I've been here for spring training, dude, this place is totally the best.  The others seriously don't stand a chance... seriously...

The chinese bbq pork ribs they have out on the chopping block are sooo goood.  Other hot food items were good, and definitely had a good abundancy and variety.  They have a mongolian bbq available too.  And they even have a sushi bar with made-to-order sushi!!  Definitely as good as it gets. 

Crazy as it sounds too, I love how they have cream puffs here for dessert.  Not like the asian cream puffs that take just like frosting whipped cream in their asian bready things, but they have legit cream puffs... they kind you would get at the freezer section of Costco.  Pretty sure they get them from Costco because their red velvet cake looks quite sim to the Costco red velvet... hehe.  At least there's some quality control then!  But yes, I can eat cream puffs like wild fire, so that's definitely a plus of coming here.  Mmmm.  

They even have Hi-C Fruit Punch here!  And from the looks of it, a full bar.

Also, I checked-in on my Yelp app and got a $5 discount off my bill.  Just show em your phone with the offer, and voila!"}
{"text":"Only 2 things i get here are the All You Can Eat Sushi rolls MADE TO ORDER and the dumplings. Everything else is just okay."}
{"text":"This place was really nice inside. It was very classy and the waiter was attentive. The food was just whatever. Nothing too great. The sushi was made to order but came in very small portions. Since all I wanted to eat was sushi this made it very difficult and awkward for me. I don't really like buffets ;{

That's why I'm trying to be nice about it. It's really unfair for a person who doesn't like buffets to review a buffet. My boyfriend said the food was just okay. Everything was cold. Decent...but cold.

They had Mr Pibb though and in my book that earns an automatic star. I don't care what you say. That's a very important thing!"}
{"text":"so far this is the best chinese buffet i've been to in phoenix. great selection and the meats seem higher quality than others i've been to."}
{"text":"Quick service and fresh food, good overall buffet. Better than most of the ones you typically find. Shorts rids were good."}
{"text":"Great food, CLEAN, friendly.
It's always nice to take the family here. 
I normally don't like buffets but this one is very clean and employees are always in point to there buffet tables. Food taste really good and they have a Mongolian grill area yummy."}
{"text":"Good buffet, albeit it's a tad on the more expensive side in my opinion.  We came here for dinner on a Sunday night for their \"Super Buffet\" which was $15.99 per person.

This buffet offers a large selection of food...hot entrees, made to order sushi, Mongolian BBQ, soup, fresh fruit and salad, and dessert.  I liked the fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, string beans, and this dish with tofu.  The egg drop soup was really good and the hot and sour soup was decent.  

For a Chinese buffet, they offered some quality desserts since some of their offerings probably came from Costco like the red velvet cake and cream puffs.  

Service was friendly and polite.  Our waitress did a great job with clearing our plates and offering to refill our hot tea.  (Hot tea was $1.60 per person, by the way.)

The restaurant is spacious and appeared to be well maintained.  Parking is easy since there's plenty of spaces in the lot out front."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to give one star but unfortunately this place was just no good. Although the customer service is great and so is the fresh sushi, the food is not. It wasn't warm and the ice cream was of different texture and flavor. I hope they improve their food standards. I left and had an upset stomach that night. I'm a buffet lover but this just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Still the best Chinese buffet in town. In my experience, the service has always been great and I have never had any issues with redeeming any discounts or coupons."}
{"text":"Pro's:
Made to order sushi \"all u can eat\" bar.
Fresh made to order Mongolian stir fry

Con's:
mediocre buffet items.
fresh oysters looked old, the same # of oysters sat on the bar the entire 4 hours we were there. CAN U SAY FOOD POISON!!!
DON'T ORDER BROWN RICE on your sushi, it tasted 3 days old!
server was rude and unattentive 
overpriced buffet

Meh, I have had way better! Perhaps next time I will come JUST FOR THE ALL U CAN EAT SUSHI"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews on Yelp and other web sites we decided to take the 40 mile drive for Sunday lunch at Hong Kong Gourmet buffet. We were not disappointed and found everything was as we expected. Cleanliness is number one, plus a good selection of freshly prepared, tasty dishes. Add to this modern, comfortable seating, helpful staff, excellent Mongolian grill, everything was great. The sushi bar was good for the price but you and I have had better, and paid a lot more for it. Finally the price for the buffet was very reasonable and the best Chinese buffet we've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The firs time i and my hubby dinner yesterday night at Hongkong Gourmet,
anything food delicious .  after we paid, waitress give discount $ 5 for the next we coming., maybe because our the first time coming.and they bring us for  2 stamp,if after 10 stamp for the 11 th stamp free. awesome.
 the waitress and any worker so nice.they can speak english and helpfull.
we met some people same our country,unbelieveble.
 if you like sea food or american food , or chinnese food, japanese food,go there.
sea food not fishy. and they have sushi bar too, they have brown rice and white rice.
price cheaper $ 2 than pacific  seafood buffet.
 maybe next week we go there again, so far with our house (40 - 50 minute),
but if any food delicious, we can go.
they have mongolian stir fry too. 
they have room for party.
i think this place bigger than any buffet at arizona.
if you vegetarian or vegan , you can eat this place ,they  helpfull what you want.
if you have family go there every  Tuesday,because family night 
one child  free per paying adult age 2- 10 every Tuesday.
i recommend  this gourmet buffet ."}
{"text":"We have gone here multiple times but this last time wasn't spectacular. We were about half way through our meal before they took our drink order (and my husband had to go find someone). I then ordered some sushi...just a California roll and something known as a New Jersey roll which was described as crab and asparagus. When I went to go get it, the sushi chef pointed at a plate with a California roll and a crab roll (no asparagus). He asked me, \"California roll and crab roll?\"  I replied, \"no, California roll and New Jersey roll\". He then threw a stalk of asparagus on the plate and gave it to me. Are you serious? I can't make this stuff up and had to take a photo. We may have to rethink our restaurant choices."}
{"text":"Alot of the items is presented neat and fresh. I like how they have fresh spinach and beef cube. Didn't care for the sushi or the mongolian BBQ though. But for $7.95 weekday lunch buffet I think the value, variety and quality is there."}
{"text":"Walked in waited in front of the counter and sign that said wait to be seated...
10 minutes went by and we were not even greeted yet. 15 min passed and nothing...
Smelled delicious and there was people eating in the dinning area."}
{"text":"I would say this is an average place I didn't really see any difference compared to all the other buffets. We went for dinner it was okay but expensive at the least $15 or $16 a person for dinner."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet in all of Arizona!  

It's really clean bright inside, rare for buffets.  My favorite things are the little sushi bar, crab legs, and the teppan table. I've never had a bad experience at this place, really nice people work here.  It's also good for a group of people."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm a big fan of buffets.  I can never eat enough to make it worth while.  Seriously, how can you keep stuffing your face after an hour!  However, I enjoyed my visit to this buffet.  Nice Sunday dinner gathering with the family.  I was impressed with some of the exotic varieties.  Frog Legs, Beef Tendon, Octopus, etc...I feel like Andrew Zimmerman!  Bizarre Foods with Bao Hoang :)  Aside from the exotic ingredients the food from the buffet wasn't bad at all.  Sushi seemed \"fresh\"..... Plus, Coronas and Bud Lights for $1 with food....man I'm coming here just for the drinks!  I like their decor since I am Asian I dig Asian art.  They definitely added an extra flare to make the place pop - totally dig the decor surrounding the Sushi bar.  - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first (and last) time. We were SO excited. A few good friends spoke very highly about this place. It's in a great location. We were excited to see how big and roomy the place was. Not overcrowded. Cleanliness was so so. Service was quick and he was super shy. At first they mixed my iced tea with soda and it was nasty. I asked for it to be fresh and he did and it was good the second round. Went up for food and I was super disappointed. Many things were empty. It looked like leftover scraps. Many things looked dryed out and very bland. I got a few things and it was okay. Besides the selection I had two huge concerns. 

1. The food is not kept at the proper safe temperature. Nothing was hot and steaming. Everything was lukewarm to cold by the time I sat down. It made me very uncomfortable. It's clear they are not sitting at the right Temps. Please be aware if you visit! 

2. The sushi bar was unclean and sushi was awful. My partner had to spit out the spicy tuna. It looked bad and not right. He was afraid to eat it. I ate two of mine that seemed okay but after his I was hesitant to go any further. 

I really was bummed to have this experience, especially hearing so good. Again it's a nice place and some of the employees were nice but their level of quality was terrible especially for how expensive it was tonight. I will not be back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"They can't decide if they want to be a cheap buffet, or slightly more upscale Chinese restaurant.

They've got the cheap Chinese buffet quality that I love so much, but not the cheap prices to match."}
{"text":"Been going there for on and off for years went tonight with my family and it was far from being what it was a year ago. The place had a out 4 tables at 6:30pm they sat us in the back corner neat the bathrooms. It was so hot and muggy when we sat down l wanted to walk out but I thought the food would make it up. Boy I was wrong  literally all the food was dry and off color. The food options are not even close to what they had a year ago and for 15$ a person. Four items were completely out of food. I wanted a piece of prime no one around to cut me a piece. We were sweating so bad during our meal it felt like we were eating on the patio TURN UP THE A.C.!!!!!. Sadly to say it was a waste of 80$ quality down hill atmosphere keep it warm to save money on light bill mentality is only going to have less people walk in the door. It was a great 10 year run on my part dining what a disappoint...."}
{"text":"Food quality is questionable.  Too expensive for what you get.  The manager wouldn't honor the special of Kids eat free(they changed kid status from 10 and under to 8, but it is STILL posted online as age 10).  They have a stamp program but told us that we had to eat at separate tables and ask for separate checks.  I'd say customer service is less than 1.  My husband got sick the next day(we think from the raw oysters, don't eat the raw stuff).  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible meal...food was cold and really no flavor...drinks were watered down and service was lacking. Will not be going back. We tried and a definite NO!!  not worth the money paid!!"}
{"text":"Terrible tasting and cold food I am a little concerned that I might get sick but hopefully not.  I tried a little bit of everything only 20% was edible.  I've been here before the food was not so bad but every time it gets worse and worse.  The neighborhood I was hoping that it would get better but I didn't think I would risk my health by coming inside and trying"}
{"text":"Good taste so good.  Long drive move from Texas to LA. Lived in Phoenix. Didn't expect this quality and taste good. Many kinds of food
Like it. Also good price."}
{"text":"You pretty much get what you expect. Relatively decent price of 12 per person during the day, but for the most part the choices do not taste good. All the chinese food (sesame chicken, orange chicken, lemon chicken, etc.) tastes pretty run of the mill or below average. Seafood ranges from edible to nasty.

Sushi bar was a cool addition. They make it fresh, but it definitely isn't high quality. Had the salmon and philly roll and it tasted as you would expect it. Underwhelming."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place so was looking forward to trying this place. I have to write I was disappointed with this place the moment I walked into the restaurant. 
The wait staff was unfriendly- none of them looked like they wanted to be there. The 
selections of food was not great for some reason I expected more. 
The best part was the sushi was made to order.  But the guy making the sushi was so surly 
in attitude that I was really put off. 
I will not be back to this place. I'm sticking to my fave:  Jasmine Tokyo!"}
{"text":"Does anyone expect a lot from a Chinese buffet?  Should they?  There were excellent ones in Washington DC, so I know they exist.  Should I temper my review with the knowledge that most Chinese buffets are far inferior to this one?  Does that make this place any better?  Sigh, I don't even know where to begin.

The place is not disgusting inside - if you want to call that neat or well-decorated, I don't know if you can.  I don't think I'd go that far.  Servers are fast and attentive with drinks and clearing plates - you have to appreciate their hustle.

The majority of the items on the buffet are absolutely, unequivocally ordinary.  If your mission is to eat as much food as possible for as cheaply as possible, this would be an excellent place to do it.  Seafood is especially fishy and most items seem as if they've had a long-life under the heat lamp.  Mongolian BBQ (which I'm a fan of) is a low-frequented item here, and the veggie selection illustrates this clearly.  There are maybe 5 roughly chopped vegetable choices, a confusing selection of sauces and a couple trays of meat melting in front of you.  Not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you'd expect.

The only true deal is the sushi, of which you can eat copious amounts of and have prepared for you fresh and on demand.  It's not exceptionally good quality, but at a place as low ticket as this, it's a welcome addition to see something being made fresh for you.

Would not go back, and the result of reading many of the reviews here leads me to believe that if this is supposed to be the best of the bunch, I might as well give up hope on the concept of the exceptional Chinese buffet in Phoenix altogether."}
{"text":"good food for a buffet
they need to hire a better sushi chef
had sushi last few times i had to spit out and throw away

{"text":"Let me preface this review with...I was not in the mood to die or get caught in a cross fire on New Year's Eve.

I walk in and manager (owner) greets me.  (He seems agitated...)

He seats me and I give my drink order.  (A buffet with COKE products?!? Score! )

I go over to the clean and attractive buffet and make my selections.   As I return to my booth, I notice this same guy in a heated duscussion with 2 customers.  Not professional by him, but I am hoping he walks away and I can enjoy my MSG in peace. 

He does.   Then, he comes back.  Argues again.  Then he leaves.  Then...he comes back.  Argues again....  

I am sitting there ready to duck if someone pulls a gun.  I take a couple of bites of food, but am too distracted. 

The couple goes to the front of the restaurant and arguing continues.   I am not sure what problem is; however,  the F Bombs are flying on both sides.

I decide I want no part if this scene.  I have only taken a few bites and I owe them nothing.   I walk out as other customers are.  I tell them to calm down and it's not worth it.

Just then my waitress comes out and asks if I am going to pay.

Um, no.  That was not a good scene and I barely touched food.

She goes back in.

He comes out.

He tells me I need to pay.  He says I wasted food.  I say that was unprofessional behavior and I am not paying. 

He says... (manager/owner)

F-Bomb!

F-Bomb you!

You Mother F-Bomber!

F-Bomb you!   You need to pay! F-Bomber!

I wave as I pull out of parking space and give him a thumbs up!  

He goes back into F-Bomb mode!

Yikes!  If this is how they operate I do NOT recommend choosing Hong Kong Gourmet. 

I do not know what initial problem was between other guests and who was at fault.   I do know it was unprofessional behavior x 100 by the manager/owner.

How can you expect patrons to dine in this situation?

F-Bomb!

F-Bomb!

F-Bomb!"}
{"text":"This place was nice!  The food was good some of it was a little cold but still good. Unlimited prime rib and sushi and Mongolian grill you can't beat it! It's a little on the pricy side being $40 for 2 adults. Good once in a while place."}
{"text":"I am such a foodie! Love trying new places, but this is one of the most dissatisfying places I have EVER been to! No flavor, everything had tasted old I arrived at 4:20 dinner started at 4pm and it didn't taste fresh at all! Horrible service, I would absolutely not recommend anyone eating at this place! 

In order to post had to give a star, it doesn't even deserve 1 I would give is a 0!"}

Really standard Asian buffet, although the staff is really friendly and nice.  And quick to refill your drink.  AND if you check in on Yelp, you can get a $5 off coupon for dinner for 2+ people.  Go for it!"}

{"text":"Huge selection and the food was fresh!  Great service!  Was definitely cleaner than some of the other Chinese buffets I've been to.  They also have made to order sushi (I didn't ry it), but that's an added plus!  All that for $8.99!"}
{"text":"Horrible, Almost Puked. I would never recommend this restraunt to anybody. The food was very dry and awful, Very bland with no flavor, I don't know how they even screwed up fried rice."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for a buffet but their food is usually cold when I go grab some. Their bathroom is a whole new story though, it's disgusting."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by Hong Kong's open and high ceilinged space, covered with tasteful wall art - the centerpiece of the restaurant/buffet being the sushi hut.

Right away, the Sushi hut  impressed me the most about the $15.99 buffet.  Whereas we were expecting some dried up rolls (made with imitation crab) on the buffet line, we were overwhelmed by the gifts of the sea we were about to receive.  The sushi chef was stationed and ready for our orders.  Yes, full size rolls ranging from the Vegas Roll to the New Mexico Roll (crab, cucumber, and avocado rolled in rice and finished with a spicy sauce, and topped with fresh tuna and lemon, garnished with smelt eggs) were there for our dining pleasure.  An assortment of plain sushi was also available, such as Salmon and Tuna.

But the wonder and awe at the generous helpings of Japanese cuisine did not stop there.  One of the buffet stations had fresh sashimi of Salmon and Tuna.  The tuna was incredibly soft and buttery, and had a beautiful texture and taste.  I could not believe it!  I easily had a half dozen pieces.  Furthermore, the salmon sashimi had great flavor, and was a decent grade - although a bit dry.  The seaweed salad tasted as good as any self respecting sushi restaurant would offer, the snow peas were just-picked fresh, accented with garlic and lemon.  Kimchee and seaweed, as well as cucumber and tofy were also available.  I had a raw oyster for my first time, as they were laid out so decoratively and invitingly - I could not resist.  Not bad once you get past the awful texture...

Now on to the rest...if I only I had had four stomachs this day to try it all!

The fish was my favorite!  The Teriyaki salmon, (very flavorful but dry) Garlic halibut, (buttery and juicy, garlic sauce had a lovely sweet and sour finish) Sea bass, ( also had excellent flavor - lemony and salty, buttery and soft) Shrimp dumplings served on a sauteed onion ring, (fresh and plump) and tempura sushi rolls with avocado crab and a sweet eel sauce, also delicious. Crab legs, with drawn butter and lemon came last, and were also ideal for feasting!

And the list goes on as I drolled over the lovely chow mein, the robust orange chicken, and flavorful chicken sesame.  The fried rice was greasy and under the heatlamp too long, but overall I could not complain.

And then I moved on to more seafood goodness with the clams, which tasted fresh, and were served in a jalapeno scallion miso broth.
The Seafood scampi was excellent, buttery garlic dreaminess.  The Thai calamari (small calamari steaks, spicy!) did not suit my tastebuds, but they were appeased immediately by the delectable  walnut shrimp (tempura battered shrimp doused in a walnut dynamite sauce, wow!) and whole crawfish (impressive as the only place to get craw is AJs and costs about $40/pound.  After the crawfish I became a bit more adventurous and tried a Whelsh snail, that I had to scoop out of its beautiful, conical shell.  Wow!!!! Just like ordering snails in a bourgoise French restaurant. Surprisingly, meat was tender and flavorful, a cross between scallop and clam, but filled with a buttery garlic flavor.

So, the smorgasboard continued on, but alas my belly was filled and there was no more room.  There was a teppan/Mongolian BBQ station as well, at which you can select your own ingredients and sauces to have cooked to order - I merely sniffed at the wonderful aromas as I passed it on my way to the dessert. Of course I had room for the coconut macarron, the chocolate moussa cake, and the lemon bar.

Speaking of bar, another impressive element of Hong Kong was the extensive cocktail menu including such classics as the Singapore Sling and Great Wall of China.  Also included were sake tinis, plum wine and sake cocktails, as well as a slew of wines and sakes.  Average cost of a cocktail was $6.50.

Is this a great place for groups? Yes! Could you even host a private party? Yes!  Would I return here? Yes!  Would I come here to impress a date? Dare I say...yes?"}
{"text":"The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was cold and the trays were almost empty.  Very disappointed in quality of food.  It seemed like they didn't want to refill the serving trays so we got the bottom of the barrel on every dish.  Not a good selection of food.  Priced too high for lunch and the people who bring the drinks are not very friendly.  The place was almost empty and it was lunch time. We will never go back.  If they can't serve hot food and lots of it, then they can keep their lousy food.  We felt kind of sick to our stomachs and I think that was because the food was not kept at the right temperature.  Stay away and find some other place."}
{"text":"Noticed that some yelpers don't really write reviews thats more than 1 paragraph or so... hopefully no one thinks I'm crazy for writing essay-like reviews on each one of the location that I've been to.  One paragraph is simply not enough room for me to describe a restaurant.

With that said.. I totally forgot that on my Southwest tour I also visited a buffet while I'm in Phoenix...(Peter C. really enjoys my buffet reviews so I'm gonna make sure that I review each and every buffet I go to! Just for you Peter!!!)

So it's about 8:15pm and we just arrived into Phoenix from Sedona after a 12 hr road trip...  I wanted something to eat but knowing that simple burger was not gonna do it.  So to treat my buddy I've decided to find a high reviewed buffets to indulge on!  (Thanks yelpers!)

The place closes at 9:00pm so we had to work quick...  It's a typical chinese style buffet that you can find in LA dime a dozen ($14.99 for dinner which is little higher than the buffets here in LA)... The location was very clean, the dining time we went was completely empty....(maybe that made it look cleaner?)  There were 4 stations with about 6-8 hot trays with your typical food fares such as orange chicken, beef with brocolli, lemon salmon, fried wonton, crab rangoon, bbq ribs, prime rib, mayonaise covered mussels, simply steamed clams, string beans, fried noodles, fried rice, fruit salad, salad bar, and a very small selection of sushi bar that had like 3 types of sushi there...(Mongolian BBQ dude was on break or something....Not Available!)

Overall the taste was half decent or was it because we were so hungry and that we had to finish up our meal fast because we still got another hour to go on the road?  Whatever it was the salmon was delicious and the ribs actually tasted really good.  Friend got the noodles with orange chicken, beef brocolli and thought idelicious as well....  I know for a fact that these chinese style buffets can't get any better or worse  (Unless you are Bamboo Garden then there is a great chance you can screw this up!), so as long as the food is not overly salty and has a respectable service, the experience should all be about the same...

( I often wonder if all these chinese buffet chefs came out of a same buffet culinary school?  There's gotta be a hidden buffet university catering just to aspiring chinese buffet chefs!!!!  Seriously, how does buffet in CA taste the same as those in AZ?  or in face WA, OR, etc.?  )

I'm guessing we were just really really hungry that is why it was so good.....Insanely 4 stars reviewed based on this one time visit....  hopefully I'm not too off.....  

Good service though!  (It took us 20 minutes to be in & out of that place!  Call us The Flash of Meals!!!!!)"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to this buffet expecting to have my socks knocked off, and even with that in mind I still left feeling totally disappointed.

All of the food fell flat in one way or another: hot foods were warm, cold foods were tepid, spicy foods one notch above bland, sushi slightly fishy. I felt like my taste buds had a cold. 

I TRIED to find at least one item that I could use as a means to get full, but in the end, nothing was good enough to have that much of. I ended up going home and making a bag of popcorn..."}
{"text":"Pretty good assortment of Chinese American dishes. Sushi is made when ordered 4 to 6 pieces at a time, which may slow down your ability to try different fishes. Lots of sea food also."}
{"text":"I like that the sushi is not made till you order it. Decent quality. The Mongolian BBQ is great. Would prefer more variety to the sauces. I don't like that they chop up the noodles as they do the stir fry. I would prefer Stir Fry, Not Chop Fry. 

Desserts are typical Asian buffet fair. Not too bad. The soft serve is quite good. 

As for the chinese buffet portion, there are some standouts and some really scary parts. You should really take the time to browse, too much to choose from in any one sitting. Tastes much better at peak time, Would never go back on off time aka after lunch and before dinner. Nothing is fresh then. 

Biggest downer is the price. Very expensive, but all food is expensive nowadays. I think I eat way too much in an effort to get my money worth. 

It has become a consistent standard in that part of town. Would recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is good we go here specifically for crab legs, frog legs and prime rib ,dinner around 16$ its worth it."}
{"text":"As a restaurant I will give 4 stars but as a buffet I will give 5 stars.

This is the best Chinese buffet I've been so far because
1. The food is very good and way beyond 'buffet' quality.
2. So many dishes. Around 10 cold dishes and around 50 hot dishes plus fruits, salad, desserts, sushi station and Mongolian grill.  They even had frog legs, duck, crab (not legs though) and mussels. I was overwhelmed and ate too much.
3. Clean and the food is fresh. Salmon and cod tasted like they cooked fresh ones, not frozen ones.
4. The people working there are nice and friendly.

My husband and I went there for Sunday lunch and our bill was around $31 including tea and a coke. 

Sushi was okay, better than buffet quality, but not as good as ones you get at sushi restaurants as the fish was not so fresh. But I like the made to order idea.

The receipt says we can get $5 discount next time within 30 days. So we will definitely go back to this place in a month."}
{"text":"Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"Was in search for a buffet place in Arizona to try on our day off and stumbled on to this place while browsing Yelp.  First impression: clean, doesnt smell overwhelmingly greasy, spacious,  and friendly staff.  The hostess greeted us and seatd us immediately.   Server quickly asked what we'd like to drink ans we began our food adventure right away.  They have many food stations so people are spread out.  Best part is that they have a Mongolian grill and a made to order sushi bar.  The staff that handles the grill and sushi bar dont talk much but they cook/ make everything to order.  The food is not bad.  Coming from san francisco, ca its hard to find impressive chinese/asian food.  The food isnt greasy, tastey, hot, and love the variety.   Everything is fresh and the food stations very clean.  Will definitely come back even if its 20 miles away!"}
{"text":"Save your money and your taste buds. Cone in right at opening, the hottest temperature item I ate was the soup and even that was sub par, tried the Mongolian option..... super gritty, no taste."}
{"text":"A little surprised by all of the great reviews here, as I was very underwhelmed. Maybe I was in on a bad day? Came for lunch, and found the chinese food to be mediocre at best. The Orange chicken I had was really bad, so dry it kind of broke apart and separated when I would cut it. I also tried the sesame chicken, mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork. Some of the flavors were okay, but all of the meat felt like it was overcooked. Maybe that was just the constant reheating from a buffet style. I didn't get seconds of anything, and while I felt bad about it, I didn't completely finish anything that I took.

I don't like sushi, so I didn't try that station, and no one was working the mongolian grill style area, so that wasn't an option. For what I had, I found it disappointing, and at $11+ a drink, tax and tip, it's not cheap enough to be worth it. Service was fine, and the restaurant seemed clean, which is a plus.

It may well float other people's boats, but Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet is not for me."}
{"text":"So let me start off with saying I REALLY wanted to like this place,. Back home there was a killer Chinese Buffet by my house so I was looking for a replacement, plus its right across the street, and had really good reviews so I had to check it out. 

We went around 5:30 on a Wednesday..when we went in only a few other people were there our waitress came over and took our drink orders and off we went to get food. The first thing I ate was an egg roll which was pretty yummy, then I ate a small crab rangoon which was cold. Then when I went to eat my Orange chicken I noticed there was a black hair stuck in the chicken under the breading. Ew. I told our waitress and she apologized profusely, but by that time I had already lost my appetite. My boyfriend wasn't really impressed with his either (most of the food was barely lukewarm) but 'I told him we might as well try the sushi before we leave. At the sushi station you order your sushi and they make it fresh. There was a sign that said, \"Brown rice upon request\", so I asked for a spicy tuna roll with brown rice. The guy making the sushi responded with, \"Maybe we don't have brown rice\", avoiding eye contact with me. Awesome.

 So after that we told the waitress we wanted the check  and she could tell we weren't pleased. Since I had only eaten an egg roll and one of their little crab rangoons I asked to have my bill either discounted or to not get charged for my meal. The waitress said she would talk to the manager. They didn't charge me for my meal which was good since I wasn't about to spend $15 on an egg roll. I also wasn't thrilled that the manger didn't come over. Oh well. Anyways I don't think I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"My brother suggested going here a while back for some reason, and I wasn't expecting a whole lot. The buffet-style dishes were the usual Chinese food fare, and they weren't bad at all. What I LOVED though was the sushi! There is an area where they will make you fresh sushi, lots of roll selections, and it's included in what you already paid. For the amount of sushi we ate, we would have spent a LOT more somewhere else, plus we got all the yummy crab puffs, noodles, etc. Going to try and go again soon!"}
{"text":"and that's it!!!! Nothing Gourmet meal about this place:-/  it's just a regular Chinese food taste less, cold, the pig knuckles is very tough not cook enough and no taste, ribs are dry.  Service is poor!!! Ambiance is nice the rest need help!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the quality of food here on the weekends. I ate here twice on a week night and the food was not fresh at all. They were cheap with the crab legs, I asked one of the employee to bring out some crab legs because there was only 4 or 5 legs left. He refused to do it and when he finally had to bring more out he brought out no more than 10 crab legs."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've here, but when we did go, it was always during lunch time with my co-workers from work.  We would stuff ourselves and go back to work totally full.

We loved that they had a sushi bar, as well as a Mongolian BBQ as well as a wide range of authentic Chinese dishes, as well as those that are geared more towards the American taste.  Wide range of desserts, too.

I just wish this place was not all the way over in Ahwahtukee and closer."}
{"text":"We've been coming Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet for a few years and this might be my favorite place for sushi. The All You Can Eat Buffet includes a made-to-order sushi station and prime rib and crab legs are served for the Dinner Buffet. I would suggest coming with a big appetite and taking your time, as there are many different types of dishes to try, including seafood, traditional Chinese favorites, and a made-to-order Mongolian stir-fry station. We usually bring the kids on Tuesday evening, as that is when kids eat free with each paying adult."}
{"text":"I love to eat at this restaurant. Food is always fresh and tons of choices for even the picky eaters. The staff is friendly and the service is always excellent. The prices are very fair for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"AVOID!!!! We went there last night and it was terrible. Everyone got sick and couldn't stomach what we ate. The food was obviously left out for some time. In fact, we saw an employee scold another employee for putting out raw sushi that was bad. We will never return here again."}
{"text":"It seems good Chinese buffet food is hard to find these days and the search continues. The food here is of very cheap quality. Very limited selection for the Mongolian BBQ. The food on the buffet was lukewarm. There was very little meat in the crab legs and it wouldn't crack open hardly and no little forks to get the meat out. The food was chewy and just bad overall."}
{"text":"The over all look, feel and customer service of the place was awesome, but I love the fact that they have sushi and crazy items like chicken feet, sea snails and red bean fungus soup. Eating there is definitely an adventure!"}
{"text":"This is where my boyfriend and I go if we want good Chinese. Its hard to find decent Chinese in Arizona in the first place but this restaurant is actually pretty good. Plus we like the buffet style when it comes to Chinese so we can try different items. Their buffet is always stocked up, there is a lot to choose from and its pretty tasty. The staff is friendly every time we go and the place is CLEAN! Too many times we've been to some buffets that are outright disgusting.
My boyfriend who is allergic to shell fish likes it because he can order tuna rolls and there has never been an issue with cross contamination which is so nice because we've gone to some upscale restaurants and have had issues! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do feel it should be a couple dollars cheaper per person but since its always been so good we'll continue to make this our Chinese restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"Even all menus are regular, common, & ordinary menus, The flavors of each foods that I tried tonight was great. I ate mushrooms with chicken, green beans, seaweeds, fried rice. The kimchi was just OK. 

The price was about $20-ish. For the same price I can get a lot more options at 'other place' buffet such as more dim sum options, big  lobster, sweet pork belly, etc."}
{"text":"They have a huge variety of food for you to chose from at the buffet and they also offer made to order sushi as part of the Buffett, which is a huge plus for my husband. They also offer .99 bud lights with your meal which makes dinner even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"THE HOLY GRAIL HAS BEEN FOUND. High end Asian buffet, Sushi that is ALL YOU CAN EAT, AND MADE TO ORDER!!! YES, that's RIGHT! FRESH MADE! You go up to the dude at the sushi bar, and pick whatever you want off of the menu, and he makes it! YES! wow! Also, the food end of the buffet is top notch! MOUNDS OF TEMPURA. So thankful for finding the great reviews here on yelp!  Prices aren't too bad either - 15.99 on Friday or Saturday night, a bit cheaper during the week, and under $10 for lunch. ALSO if you mention yelp, you get $5.00 off the bill for 3 or more!!! Service was impeccable! Very clean, nicely laid out, etc.. I CANNOT WAIT TO RETURN."}
{"text":"Very cool.  Was there on a Sat nite, very packed!  But it was fun! The kids all enjoyed it. the food was great and it was a nice visit to Phoenix/Chandler!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place for their all you can ear sushi. Great Asian buffet. LOVE their ribs. Been back a few times already : )"}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful and huge selection and most of the food is great. Considering the selection is probably twice that of any other Chinese food buffet place and about a good 80% of the dishes are very well made and delicious, you won't go home hungry.  We both really loved the food.  They also have a few dishes that are not Chinese, to add variety and I guess for those who want some regular food.  The service was also excellent - cheerful, friendly, from the front desk to the person waiting the tables.  It was a pleasant experience and we WILL go back. Oh - totally reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Since moving from CA to AZ, I couldn't find a decent Chinese restaurant.  Then I found this place and I couldn't be any happier.  The variety of food is endless.  And having the sushi station is a great plus.  Although the sushi station is quite a wait due to only 1 or 2 people working there at a time.  The mongolian noodle station is also great.  It's different from just having the regular chow mein.  And if you're not sure how to make it, just ask any of the cooks and they'll help you make the right mix.  

Price:  $15 for all you can eat Chinese, and made to order sushi, plus a dessert bar.  You just can't beat it."}
{"text":"The only thing really worthwhile is the Sushi Bar.   And considering you can eat all you want for $14.95, it isn't a bad deal if you like Sushi.

As for the rest of the food?   Let's just say it is very, very average, and not very fresh.   The place is also starting to look tired and worn.   

However, if you rate your restaurants based on the amount of food they serve - and God knows, many people do - you will find Nirvana."}
{"text":"Ugh.. Another Asian Buffet. Wasn't to thrilled to go to an Asian Buffet. So I decided to try the Sushi Bar. There is no pre-made sushi. All made to order and the food was fresh. I was surprised that it was pretty good. Only thing is that you only get four sushi per order.
I also tried the stir fry grill. The food was fresh and I thought that it was pretty good. I was very surprised with the sushi and the stir fry grill. 
I tried the other buffet food and it was normal average Asian buffet food. 
I was a little surprised by the desert. The red velvet cake wasn't dry but moist. The cream puffs had different flavors inside. Not bad but not great desert. 
So overall just stick to the sushi bar and stir fry grill that's probably the only thing worth going to this place."}
{"text":"Nice selection of Chinese food with a mix of authentic and more American-Chinese food. Food was good but nothing really made me go back for seconds. The sushi bar was decent, but you have to keep going back to order more."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews my boyfriend and I decided to go today (10.9.11) and omg it was the bomb!!!!!. I highly recommend Hong Kong Buffet..if you go you must try the craw fish, sooooo good!!!...I give this place 6 stars! Yum-o!"}
{"text":"This is the best Asian Buffet by far.  They even have prime rib and crab legs on the weekend.

My only complaint, make sure you get there well before anytime close to closing.  When they are close to closing time, they don't fill the buffet with much new food."}
{"text":"My first and last time here. Food selection was shockingly small. I went there at 4:30pm today (08/10/16) and there was only one more customer there with me. I ordered lemonade and it tasted strange; like someone added bad water to it. I decided to use the restroom and I was disgusted. I'm a nursing student, so I must admit that  I pay attention to cleanliness, but this place was really filthy. All toilets were flushed, but not properly cleaned on the outside. I paid the dinner price of $19.95 and I left a 15% tip for the girl because she was good at her job. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I chose this particular place because of all the reviews I read in my car prior to entering this place. I wonder how some  of the customers can say this place has a wonderful food selection. And btw, no there was no sushi there. Oh, and one more thing. Music was too loud and they were playing music from the 80s and 90s. I don't mind hearing Madonna's songs, but I'd rather listen to some peaceful Chinese music instead."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place. Moved to the far East Valley but travel to HFGB at least once a week. Very clean, friendly servers, no dirty carpets (restaurants should NEVER have carpet), food is fresh, sushi is a PLUS and made to order (not premade and old). Check it out!"}
{"text":"About as good as it gets for Chinese buffet: Fresh food, dishes that don't make you go \"ewwww . . . what the hell is that doing here???\", real sushi made fresh, mongolian BBQ, a nice full bar, decor that's modern, sleek and clean combined with friendly and efficient service-- All for less than $10 at lunch. I'm in CentPho but still think it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We definitely would eat here again.  The servicem  was beyond what you would consider a buffet house.  And the assortment of dishes to choose from was outstanding.  The stations were all clean and the food was kept fresh.  Sushi is isn't just laid out like most places. Here its to order.  A very first class, top knotch establishment.   I will definitely be recommending them to my friends and family.  
Thank you all for a very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Cold food (that should be hot) is the main problem. It was difficult to try to figure out what food was \"hot enough\" to be safe. I can imagine county health inspectors having a field day with a thermometer in there! The floor tile looked like a product of the 80's and appears grotesquely filthy. Another issue is that the Yelp $5 check in discount was not honored, despite asking two different folks. Service staff seemed quite disinterested in actually providing service. There was one gal who seemed to be more cheerful than the rest, but she was working another area. Would a welcoming smile and a \"hello\"kill ya??

I would much rather to to pacific seafood buffet for the same price."}
{"text":"I have been going to Hong Kong gourmet for years now and I'm officially over it. We haven't gone in a few months and we went at 730pm on a Friday. Food was old and not being replenished. I saw maybe two items brought out freshly cooked the entire time I was there. Service was okay. But for what we paid, not even worth it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My mom introduced us to this place, over 6 years ago! The food is always fresh and warm, their chowmein is amazing. Also love their spicy chicken with jalapeños and they used to have the best peanut chicken, but they don't have that anymore. Service is quick and there are plenty of choices. Love the sushi bar and my family loves the fresh noodle area where you can pick all your own ingredients and they make it there for you. They also have a great seaweed salad and dessert bar. A family favorite."}
{"text":"Best oriental buffet I have experienced yet. The selection of foods is exceptional. Quality is also quite good.

Update: Went back recently and quality has gone down hill. Too bad this place was quite good."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the place overall,  I thought it was pricey for lunch but the selections and food was good.  Would go again,  service was good as well.  Very clean."}
{"text":"My mom is flat out addicted to buffets, which she calls smorgasbords. They don't have to be good, they just have to be cheap. This one isn't particularly cheap, it's not expensive either, but it is asian so she really likes that. This used to be better. Over the years it's gotten progressively greasier, the selections more limited and my favorite, the crab legs, have gotten much worse. The quality of crab legs they are ordering now are barely edible. Overall, I'd recommend passing on this one."}
{"text":"Little over a year since I came here and reviewed it for the first time. This was my third visit and I definitely enjoyed it. I arrived around 2:45 to a nice friendly front desk crew and a kind server. I ordered a water and got straight to business. The miso soup was fantastic.. Actually mostly everything was fantastic. Some of the stars of the show were nicely prepared spinach, mussels and clams, and there were several different types of chicken including coconut chicken which was fantastic. The only items I didn't really care for was the gyoza and the fried fish. I enjoyed some freshly made sushi from the sushi chef including 4 pieces of salmon, 4 pieces of tuna, and a 4 piece New York roll. For $10.60 after tax for a lunch buffet it is definitely worth it. They also still have a punch card where you buy 10 and the 11th is free."}
{"text":"Best buffet I have ever eaten at.  The food is fresh not over cooked or nasty tasting from sitting so long.  I love that they make their sushi fresh, not that pre made garbage sushi that most buffets have.  I do think dinner is a little expensive at $16 but I have to say their food is not just your run of the mill nasty buffet.  They have awesome service and it smells nice in there.  I love Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Clean resturant. Great place for big groups because it's all the same price. Makes math easy. Food was so so, but consitent on quality and presentation. Would return."}
{"text":"After reading all of the stellar reviews, I was expecting stellar.

The Good:
I like that they have the Sushi Bar.
The expansive dining area was aesthetically pleasing

The Bad:
I just didn't like any of their other items... 

I tend toward less \"Americanized\" Asian food, and they didn't have a wide assortment, for my liking."}
{"text":"lol this place used to be so good but now it tastes terrible! I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. All the food there tastes like it has been out for hours. None of the workers seemed to care when I complained about the food. All they did was give me 10% off which didn't help much. most of the workers barley spoke English as well."}
{"text":"When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet, I wasn't at all apprehensive. My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. 

Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. 

Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. 

If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot."}
{"text":"At one time was my favorite Chinese Buffet in town but still can be good.

If you come here there are 3 must items. The fresh sushi that is offered,  at dinner time the bbq ribs and the salt and pepper shrimp.

There is a good selection of sushi that you can order and will be made for you. My favorite is the dragon roll. As for the bbq ribs they are generally very meaty and tender with chinese bbq sauce. For my favorite dish hands down is the salt and pepper shrimp. You may think this is strange but I eat the shrimp with the legs and shell but not the tail. The reason is the shell has all the flavoring on it so if you take off the shell you may as eat it like a shrimp cocktail.  Try it with the shell you will like it. 

The lunch and dinner menu are very different with dinner having prime rib, bbq ribs and a few additional items.

Still a good buffet especially when there are a lot if people so the food turns over so they are constantly bringing out fresh food."}
