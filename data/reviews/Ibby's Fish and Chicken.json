{"text":"My husband was \"told\" to pick up some food as I was working late ....he delivered. More lucky than anything else.He asked what he should order if he wanted fish. The worker kindly told him whiteling and it was perfect. Just go here....

Great place...go there and enjoy great food"}
{"text":"Ive been looking for a soul food place and ive have found the best place ever food is so good thank you for the best service ever"}
{"text":"Okay. I guess I am the minority in this opinion, but I did not find the food at Ibby's to be exceptional by any means. We ordered the catfish filet, catfish strips, and fried chicken. Sides were macaroni and cheese, potato salad, and fries.
The catfish was majorly overcooked. DRY and disappointing. That was a huge surprise. I realize we are in Arizona so my expectations are adjusted here, taking that into account. 
I did not try the chicken as it did not look appetizing at all. My husband agreed that Popeye's or Church's does a better job there. 
The \"potato\" salad was mostly egg, lacking any seasoning or flavor. It reminded me of the containers of egg salad you get at Fry's. Nothing special. The fries, which \"came with\" the catfish and chicken, were bland and generic. I would have preferred to sub these for something else or leave them out entirely.
One item worth noting is the macaroni and cheese. This was the best part of the meal to be honest. Creamy, yet cheesy on top and the pasta was cooked just right. This should be a main dish!
The cornbread served with the order was stale, dry and unappetizing. Also included were PACKETS of tartar sauce (?!?!?). What...? Even Pete's makes their own sauce. This was very disappointing. The hushpuppies did taste fresh, but for the most part, were lacking seasoning and texture.
Hot sauce is provided, in small plastic containers. This helped with the flavor but luckily, I had some malt vinegar in the cabinet to help.
I do not want to hurt this small business with this review. Actually, my intent is to give feedback so that they can improve and succeed. Having soul food is a rare treat for us, as it is usually unhealthy so on this occasion we decided to give Ibby's a try. I hope they can fix these issues because I would like to see this small business succeed. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I drove from Surprise, AZ to have lunch at Ibby's and it was well worth the drive! Affordable pricing and AMAZING soul food! Everything we ordered was great. The service was also personable and friendly! Hope they add a West Valley location. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, since I was going to be in Chandler and needed a bite to eat (I live in Glendale). Awesome food. Had the catfish and chicken wings with their mild house sauce. Wow! Good food. Mac'n cheese and coleslaw are both delicious! Truly finger licking good!"}
{"text":"I came for the French fries which were great! But their chicken I would not buy again. I can make better."}
{"text":"The food isn't good and the owner is a jerk. Worst customer service. This place should be shut down for uncleanliness as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I'd been craving good fried chicken all week and finally choose here because I heard so many good things about it.  Maybe I was there on an off day for chicken? I got an order to go with a combo of shrimp and fried chicken with 2 sides and an order of tilapia and an order if catfish,  both come with 2 sides.
-The employees/owners? were very nice. 5 stars.
Main dish:
-The fish (fried catfish and tilapia) were really good. I'd add another side of tartar and cocktail sauce to the bag,  but I'm sure if I'd asked it would have been no problem.  5 stars
-The shrimp was also really good.  5 stars
-The chicken was not very good at all.  It was shriveled and dried out. The drumstick had maybe 3 bites of meat.  I gave the larger piece to someone else to eat/taste without saying anything.  Same response without me even asking.  He had maybe 2 bites trying to find the meat and then gave up and did it was dry and almost all bone. 

Sides:
-Coleslaw was good. I liked it. I like almost any coleslaw.  Would get it again any time. 
-Mac and Cheese was not bad,  but I'm not sure what the flavor was.  It was very wet so the noodles were mushy. It wasn't bad,  just an off flavor from what I'm used to. I wouldn't get it again,  but people do seem to like it.
-Green beans were good. They were a little salty, but an interesting combo of veggies. 
-Corn was corn.
-Rice w gravy- No. I try not to say to stay away from things because each person has a different palate, but this was truly not good. The best I can describe it as is 5 minute tuve that is overcooked and mushy, almost like rice pudding consistency.  I could see chunks if chicken in it,  but it did nothing for the flavor and served only to make it even more mushy. 

There's also baked chicken and I'm kicking myself for not just getting that. I would definitely get the shrimp and fish again, and the Coleslaw, but most of the sides and the fried chicken would have to be off the list. I hope I just went in on a day where it was atypical and on another occasion all would be great. 
You can get your Living Chandler bracelet there,  too."}
{"text":"The chicken's great and as fresh as it gets! I'd also recommend the fried catfish strips. the rice and gravy is fantastic great comfort food all around and don't forget desert"}
{"text":"Wow. What a welcome surprise. Drove to Chandler from Tucson specifically to get a catfish dinner and to see my Brother. Yelped catfish and Ibby's came up first. This place gets a two thumbs up. Great service and great food. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"It's the first time I've had fried whiting fish and it didn't disappoint. And I was really on the lookout for good fried chicken in Tempe.

The fried leg and thigh had a nice medium and crispy crunchy coat that had a bit of seasoning in the batter. The leg was below-average to average in size. The thigh had one of those cuts in which the end of the thigh bone is cut off and includes a lot of the back ribs of the chicken and there is no meat on that part. It just makes it look bigger.  

The whiting fish will definitely satisfy most seafood cravings. It has a slightly thinner but similar batter as the chicken. Nice and crispy and well seasoned. It has a medium fishiness which is perfectly fine for me (they also have swai and tilapia for mild fish).

The steamed collard greens was good and the mac n cheese seemed to have a cream cheese base and it stayed really nice and creamy the whole time.

The entrance to this little place is on the East side of the building or you (me) will find yourself walking all the way around next to the 'bertos drive thru. The staff is pleasant and made sure I was okay after forgetting my order at first. They apologized, had it out quickly, and I didn't really wait too long. 

I'm always a fan of combos that let you try multiple items. The swai and tilapia is definitely next."}
{"text":"Fresh food cooked to my desire. Have not had such good catfish since I moved from Los Angeles. Wonderful customer service!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight for the first time. Fried shrimp was perfectly delicious and crisp with good cocktail sauce. The Mac n cheese is very good, too, perfect texture and delicious cheese. Cornbread was just sweet enough. We ate this for dinner and I had more than enough left over for tomorrow night too. Peach cobbler was amazing!  We called in the order and came 15 minutes later as they were putting our food into the to go packages. They were still steaming hot when we got home on kyrene and Warner 10 min later. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for business puposes and was greeted by friendly staff. Choosing to wait for the owner Antoine, I was offered not only water but samples. There were some senior ladies enjoying their lunch and striking up conversation they said they \"always enjoy eating at IBBY'S!\"  I received my sample of peach cobbler which was divine, reminded me of what came from my Grandmother's oven. And the crust, perfection! Then a wing, as I enjoyed the music and was happy about its conversation conscious volume. Did I look hungry, a taste of fish although it was not my fav, catfish it was good too! All in all, Ibby's on the fly was a memorable tasting experience and I will be rolling in with :throwin down\" as my purpose. 
Thank you Lisa and the other staff for your customer service and Antoine, has a great team and amazing food."}
{"text":"Never ever again! I ordered 40 wings( way over priced) for a party. They were the worst looking(can't even get to taste yet) I have ever been served!! The wings were black in the joints like they were not fresh!! And had been frozen for sometime. Now I am well aware that 90% of serving food is presentation, because if you can't get past how it looks you are never going to eat it! I tasted one of the better looking wings and it had no flavor ie seasoning. Well at that point I could not take it back because my party was starting and I couldn't serve it either, so that was about $70 (with a whole pan of fries that I didn't want but that's another issue) in the garbage!! I was so upset I didn't bother calling them back because I wanted to be cheerful for my event. I will add the staff is really nice and customer service is very important but not more important than quality food!! If I want chicken unfortunately I will have to stick to the grocery store chains.  Please see the pictures of my appetizing black wings!!  Now imagine serving a whole pan of these! Yum!"}
{"text":"I was craving for some fish and chip. Saw the reviews for this place and decided to try them out. Reviews were true, great food, awesome service. Fish and chips was awesome. 2 huge pieces for fish and fries. Couldn't be happier. I will definitely be back for some more!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch...gotta try dinner!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I wish we had more places like this. My favorite is the fried chicken."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a restaurant which sells fried Halal chicken, and as far as I know this place is the only restaurant offers that. But it didn't satisfy my expectations unfortunately. First of all, fried chicken they serve was dry and lack of flavor. Another thing to add, they are not serving any kind of bread or biscuits with the chicken. It is hard to leave that place with full stomach without bread. But when I crave for fried chicken, fortunately there is one I can go and have :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The fried chicken is amazing and their buttered corn and cornbread are incredible.  Everyone is really friendly and polite, and the prices are really fair for how much food you get.

Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place but just found it to be ok. The collard greens and Mac and cheese we're great, we also got chicken and fish that was good but nothing special. I may go back if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  I had the fried catfish with green beans, red rice and beans.  So good, some of the best fish I've had in the valley.  The owner was great and brought out various samples for me to try while I was there.  The sweet potato pie and peach cobbler are must haves.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"absolutely everything was spot on. the chicken was cooked to order and was perfectly seasoned.  the sides were damn good. Antoine is incredibly nice. totally worth the trip from Arrowhead down to Chandler and I wouldn't think twice about heading down there again."}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about the chicken and was excited to try them. The chicken was golden brown, but the inside was GROSS. I don't know what went wrong, but I've never seen chicken look like that. It was inedible.

The side portions were extremely small, due to the tiny tray compartments, but they were delicious which accounts for the two stars. Inedible chicken + super tiny sides = still hungry and a waste of money"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favorite and stop by! The service was astounding. Friendly and helpful. I think he walked to Walmart to get me a specific drink I wanted. The fish plate is an amazing value, the Mac and cheese was the best I've had in a while, they should sell it by the pound. Everything tasted deliciously home made, will be a new regular. Sweat pants were a good choice."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"WOW\"....it's about time a place in AZ can make food that can remind me of home (down in tha South)

I will be back....

Thank you, Ibby"}
{"text":"Not cheap, ordered the tilapia dinner with shrimp. Fish was was flavorless but fried perfectly, mediocre sides...the tarter was disgusting the best item I had was sweet potato pie and shrimp. I leave my meal total came to 25 bucks"}
{"text":"Just stopped by today on my way to pick my kids and grab some fried chicken. Was blown away by the freshness of the food and how crispy and delish the chicken was. Def going back for the grilled fish and the jumbo shrimps!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to love this place. However, after new management, the quality and quantity of the food have diminished greatly. The mac and cheese, which used to be one of a kind and phenomenal, now tastes generic and bland. Initially, I thought I was given shrimp by mistake upon seeing the size of the chicken tenders, but it was, indeed, chicken tenders. It's unfortunate that we didn't enjoy our meal as much, but we will most likely not return."}
{"text":"I went there for the catfish and was not disappointed at all. You know sometimes catfish comes out tasting oily. Well this wasn't. It was what I remember from the South in my youth.

My wife, who is from the Northeast, said it was the best chicken she has ever had. And she's tried chicken in a lot of places, let me tell you.

As for the sides, I had potato salad, coleslaw, and buttered corn. Yum. My wife had mashed potatoes, buttered corn, and coleslaw. There are more sides. I will try the collards and yams next time, when I come in for the chicken.

This is a little hole in the wall place, if you are looking for ambiance, then don't come here. If you are looking for fast food, don't come here. They do chicken from scratch (it takes 20 minutes).

But, If you are looking for great down home food, COME HERE.

The only thing that could make it better, would be the addition of fried green tomatoes, and fried okra to their menu. Hear that y'all?

I will be back! My wife loves the place, and she is not from the South.

I would give the place 6 stars if I could. Well done, y'all."}
{"text":"Great little place! Very clean and the owners are very friendly! The food was great too. I had been looking for a great home cooked seafood dinner in my area and this fits the bill perfectly. I had collard greens and fries along with my fried catfish and shrimp and topped it off with the sweet potato pie! Everything was great.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ive been coning here for the last few weeks. And the food and the service is excellent. And the prices are even better."}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 meat combo with fish & chicken that comes with 2 sides. Chicken was ok but the fish was thin & a bit rubbery. Seasoning was good on the 2 meats. The sides were mac-n-cheese & greens, the greens were good but the mcncheese was a bit too runny for me. Runny meaning the cheese sauce was too thin and not as settled as itb should be. The greens were delicous, seasoned well. I also ordered large shrimps, now this was delicious! The order comes with 12 shrimps that were big, crispy and seasoned very well. As a matter of fact the whole meal was seasoned well just a few minor changes needed. It is a bit pricey $28.00 for 2 meat combo and shrimps,  although if the meal was overall delicious I wouldn't of mind paying that much for. I knocked a star off for runny mac n cheese & rubbery fish. I will go back for the shrimps though."}
{"text":"Just had this for the first time. I had two pieces of the catfish. One was hardly seasoned but the second piece was great. The fish was seasoned nicely and very flavorful. My son got the shrimp and he said it was great too. Perhaps they just need to mix the breading better so that the seasoning gets all in there. The fish was cooked perfectly. It was moist and still hot when we got home. Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"I'm all about supporting the independently owned restaurants here's my honest review. The mac and cheese wasn't cheesy enough, the chicken was ok. On a lighter note the peach cobbler and sweet potato  pie were pretty good. I'm from the south so this is no mean feat. A little overpriced but they may still be working out price points.  The manager/owner was willing to resolve a customer service issue with no difficulty which can help maintain the  reputation and value of their brand. The place is pretty busy so try ordering ahead of time there aren't alot of soul food restaurants in Chandler."}
{"text":"Can't say I ever had a burger so perfectly cooked at this price.

I asked for medium-rare and got exactly that. Better than 5 Guys in quality and price."}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com  They get major points for making Mac n cheese with a roux versus just putting cheese on some noodles.
And they are also super friendly.
Hush puppies are awesome.
Shrimp is awesome.
Just go here."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get delicious southern food. I recommend to all. Glad I found Ibby's!!!! The chicken and rice with gravy is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised of the quality & the taste of our meals. Ibby's has the old Southern feel. This is good Southern Food. I order, catfish & Shrimp. My side's were, collards greens & red beans w/rice . A little  much on the sodium on the red beans, but they were good. I tasted my Husband, Mac & Cheese, so good. Both my husband & son enjoyed the peach cobbler, they said it was one of the best. I would recommend Ibby's as a must. The proportions are generous & the food is fabulous. Chandlers own, Taste  of the South...."}
{"text":"I have been in AZ for 4 years and I have never found a \"Real\" soul food place that I like. I am from the South and I miss my southern food. Yesterday I was at my friend's house and was scrolling through Yelp to find a place to eat. I came across this place and was skeptical b/c I have been disappointed before by so called southern places. The reviews and pictures of the food looked really good so I decided to give it a try and take my friend with me. We walk in and you can smell the great food in the air. I walk to the counter where a nice woman greeted me and I told her I found their place on yelp. She mentioned the owner took over 3 months ago. I ordered the dinner special and I was skeptical again about the candied yams and cornbread. She offered me a sample of the yams and before I taste it I smelt it and I knew it was going to be great. Tasting it confirmed it! I was and still in love with them. I asked her if the cornbread has kernel corns in them and she told me no. I was very happy b/c it seems like a west coast thing with kernel in the cornbread. I never heard of that until I moved out here. She did tell me that it will take about 15 mins for the food to be ready since they cook the meat made to order. We were fine with that. When we got our food everything was GREAT! I had a lot of catfish nuggets and have a lot for leftovers for work. I re-ordered some more of the sides (mac and cheese, yams and greens) for my lunch too. The owner and the nice woman are doing their thing in the kitchen. If I wasn't moving to Dallas this Friday I would definitely be coming back. I did get some flyers and passed them out at work since they mentioned they do deliver. I wish this place was here a long time ago. If you can't be patient for 15 mins to wait for soul food cooked fresh from scratch then this is not the place for you. People that knows great soul food knows that's a standard wait time. I hope this business succeeds in AZ."}
{"text":"Nice people serving tasty comfort food.

Three of us shared fried chicken and whitefish.  Key word is fried.  If you are looking for health food, keep looking.

However, the batter and seasoning on both the fish and chicken were delightful.  The chicken was tender and juicy, the fish was light and flaky.

Sides were mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes greens.  All were good, much like home cooking by someone who knows how to cook.

Girl that took our orders was friendly and pleasant throughout the meal.

If you like this sort of food, Ibbys does it well."}
{"text":"A solid 4. The service was awesome. The breading on the fish and the chicken was flavorful and crisp.  The fish and the chicken remained moist inside. The red beans and rice was very very good.  Hush puppies had good flavor.  Portion to cost was appropriate.  We will defiantly return."}
{"text":"The employees were terrific! Very helpful and very nice. The food was mediocre at best. The collard greens were too salty, the chicken and fish were tasteless.. lacked flavor but was nicely fried. I wanted to love this place because of the awesome reviews. But I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Tried this place today for the 1st time and I will definitely be back! Ordered a fried chicken dinner and my fiancé got a catfish dinner. Dinners come with 3 sides which all together is more than enough food to fill you up. When we ordered we were told it would be about 15 minutes which was no problem whatsoever. Everything came out fresh and delicious! The chicken is the best I've had since moving here from Texas. It was perfectly cooked and and an amazing crunch to it. There's a great selection of sides. The red beans and rice and mac and cheese are perfect! The owner was really awesome and we definitely can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I don't think we will be going back unfortunately. The last couple of times we have gone (calling in our order 20-30 min ahead) we have had to wait over an hour for our food. Last time we ordered 1 hour before and we didn't get our dinner for two until 2 hours later! They seem short handed in staff. Quality of food has gone down. Greasy and just not the same as when we first started going here. A shame as we live close by and enjoy giving our business to local vendors. :(
Hopefully they take a step back and rethink how they can turn the quality and service around soon or I don't think they will be around much longer."}
{"text":"We tried it a few days ago and we are fans!! Super friendly personnel, absolutely delicious fried whiting, collard greens and my husband's fried chicken tasted as good as my great-grandmother's fried chicken!! We'll be back. My husband said mac 'n cheese was creamy, true comfort food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ibby's chicken and other food is really good, to start with. My kids love the Mac-n-cheese especially, and my wife and teenage daughter really love the collard greens. The chicken was nice and hot and seemed freshly prepared. The staff is friendly and when they're busy, they're really jumping, though a bit disorganized.

However, both times we've got take out there (ordering in Eat24), we've had problems with our order. Part of it may be some opportunity for improved processes (we had a lot of sides with a variety of meals on our first order, and I had to check 3 times that we had everything. A simple checklist of things going in the bag would help a lot). Today, we kept it simple and just got 12 piece chicken and a variety (5) of sides.  Of the 12 piece, we had 0 breasts, 3 thighs, 4 legs (one of which could have really been a drummy it was so small), 5 wings. No one mentioned anything about a non-standard ratio (I expected 3 of each piece). The sides we're all correct from what I ordered. 
I will call tomorrow and see what they say about no breasts, other reviews mentioned Antoine taking care of any issues."}
{"text":"I had been holding off coming here because there were really good reviews on Living Chandler Facebook group but so good that Ibby's was BUSY! I understand why people like Ibby's. We ordered the Chicken dinner with Red Beans & Rice & Yams as well as the Fish (catfish) & Chicken dinner with Collard Greens & Mac & Cheese. We also had a large order of Hush Puppies (8).  The meals came with drink which was nice.  The girl that waited on me was very friendly & seemed to offer a bit more of attention to assure I received all so needed (tartar sauce, hot sauce etc...bagged the food since we did to go).  They recognized certain customers by name which was refreshing (Shoutout to Ms. Pat, the staff all greeted her). They do have a tip drawer so I added a $1 and it was nice to see they were selling the Living Chandler bracelets (of course I forgot mine). So now let's talk about the food... IT WAS AMAZING! Every single thing we had was good. The tartar sauce was tasty & a nice add with the fish.  It's nice to now have a place with great service AND wonderful food. Overall a good experience!!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nothing fabulous about this business, the soul food is mediocre.  People that are not use to soul food will think this place is amazing.  Overly priced, no family meals.  I choose church's chicken any day over this place.  I mean nothing special.  I bet the lease of the location is why the prices are so high.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I went back to this establishment today and the Owner was nice enough to speak with me and show me that what I was given was more than likely Whiting Fish instead of Catfish.  The catfish today was bomb.com, just like good ol catfish is supposed to taste like. He also took care of my meal, which was pretty upstanding."}
{"text":"Stopped by Ibby's on my lunch break to check out the fish and chips. The batter that they use is bomb!! Very impressed!! Do yourself a favor and get the peach cobbler, great flavor and not heavy."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on  the advice of a co-worker. I went during lunch and found the food to be fabulous! I had the chicken tenders, mac & cheese and candied yams. No complaints about the food. I loved it and I have been to Ibby's 3 times this month.  

My only complaints are that each time I have visited, I ordered the chicken tenders and each time after waiting 15 minutes or more for my meal (no complaint about the time.. just stating a fact) I received chicken wings. It is really weird to me that they consistently give me wings when I am very explicit with my order and state that I want chicken tenders. This is just weird that this mistake happens every time. Today, I placed a to-go order for chicken tenders and when I got to my destination....I HAD CHICKEN WINGS!!! I should have checked before leaving the restaurant but this time I repeated several times when placing my order that I wanted chicken tenders.  Not sure how much clearer I could have been.

Secondly, I dont understand why they never make enough desert, specifically the peach cobbler.  Each time I have visited, they have been out of the cobbler. I was told that it sells out early.  That is fine, but if a restaurant sells something that is a popular item, why not make enough to last the entire day.  If you are selling out by lunch time and you are open for dinner, then that is just very poor planning on the part of the restaurant.  If this consistently happens, then remove peach cobbler from the dinner menu.

Overall, I will return because the food really is good. I will however, NOT leave without  checking my order.  Also, I wont make plans to have desert because most likely there wont be any available anyway."}
{"text":"Tried this place after one of my friends recommended. I felt the food was just okay. I come from a big city where there's tons of soul food spots and very delicious. I felt this place is over priced for the type of food. I had the catfish and 3 sides for $14.50. Mac n cheese was okay nothing to it and the collard greens had way too many stems. Red beans had a nice flavor but were dry. Then I received one small size piece of catfish. I also ordered the wings which were party wings not even whole wings and lacked seasoning
Peach cobbler was delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS! I had the Fish and Chicken Combo with Mac n cheese, red beans & rice, and candied yams. Yes, I was that hungry, lol. I ate it ALL! 

First thing I notice was the reviews were excellent and I was in town on business and wanted some good food. I was greeted by the smell of GOOD FOOD when I walked in. I also noticed a sign about \"mild sauce\" so I asked if the owner was from Chicago because that's what some of us Chicagoans like on our wings and fries. He was from L.A. but his mild sauce was on point! 

The food was seasoned PERFECTLY! The fish and chicken was hot, fresh, and crispy. Mac n cheese was nice and cheesy with a little herb and spices mixed in. It was suprisingly good. I hate when folks add too much stuff to mac n cheese and ruin the CHEESE flavor. This mac n cheese was not ruined, trust me. The red beans and rice were excellent and the candied yams didn't put me in a diabetic coma, it was perfectly sweeten. 

Happy I dined in. The place is not that big but its cozy, clean and I could tell it is well liked because there was a constant flow of people and lots of regulars. I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"Under new management. Still have halal options. We had  catfish and swai with a few sides. Good fried food!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time and I was not disappointed! Super small little place, but HUGE portions. I ordered the chicken lunch with Mac and cheese and fries as a side. The fries were so delicious! The chicken was so tasty. Had so much flavor and was so crispy. Not a huge fan of the Mac and cheese. It tasted more like noodles with Alfredo. Still tasted good just wouldn't call it Mac and cheese. Their mild sauce was off the chain! So fricken good. 10 out of 10 would come back. So close to work, might make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and really reasonably priced! I had my parents bring us a few meals, we devoured it and went back for more 30 minutes later! Loved the chicken, shrimp and green beans!"}
{"text":"This was an experience! Ordered fried catfish, collard greens, Mac and cheese and candy yams, heaven on a plate.  Everything super fresh, staff is amazing, place is very clean.  They fry your food at the time of order, I mean I loved it all.  I'm very particular with soul food, and this hit the spot.  Can't wait to bring my husband to try!"}
{"text":"Get over here and get some chicken, or fish, or shrimp or whatever you're in the mood for.  I haven't eaten chicken this good since I left St. Louis and our favorite King Edwards Fried Chicken behind.  

My husband and I stopped in over the weekend and each got one of the 2-pc chicken lunch specials for $7.99.  The chicken comes with 2 sides and I ordered the mac & cheese (heavenly) and the green beans (fantastic!  Like Grandma use to make) and he got the hush puppies (totally addictive) and red beans and rice (sssssssooouuulllll food, baby).  Excellent all around.  The sides are all homemade and I was tempted to get some more of that mac & cheese and take it home for a midnight snack.  But I behaved myself.

The chicken has a perfectly seasoned, light breading that is probably someone's closely guarded secret.  The staff was friendly and patient when I was trying to decide what to order.  It all sounds so good.  We've already decided that next time we're going to fast for a day and then go in and order that Sho-nuff combo.  They had some cool music playing and there's some interesting artwork to enjoy on the walls.  Perfect all around.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and soggy. No one out of my family of 4 ate even half of their plate."}
{"text":"Chicken is good.  The sides very disappointing.  Heard so many good things but was not excited. Dry mac n chs really? Collards n red rice n beans bland.  Corn bread too dry to eat. Ate there and no one even asked how it was although it isn't that kind of restaurant.  Sadly we wont be heading back as I like to support local."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place from a co-worker and decided to give it a try.  I ordered the chicken w/two sides. 

First the sides.  I ordered mashed potatos and gravy.  Overall not really that impressed.  It was a little on the bland side.  The gravy just needed a bit more flavor and tilt would have been fine. 
The mac and cheese was different then I'm normally used to getting in a reaturant.  I was pretty happy with the flavor and was surprised to see it was cheesy.  
The portion size for both was fine.  It was enough to fill you up.  I can see some people having an issue but since this was lunch i didn't want a huge pile of sides and suffer later at work.
The chicken.  The meal came with a drumstick and thigh.  The skin was nice and chrsipy and had great flavor.  In reading the other reviews from other people I can see why they may not think it's the best.  While the flavor was good it  didn't do anything to make it stand out against the others so I can see why people wither thought it was the best or worst.  
Overall the place looked clean on the inside and the staff was friendly.
Ibby's has a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Clueless employees! Expensive fried food. Tiny drinks. They do not have several sauces for their chicken. The chicken strips were good. Not to much batter, and fried nicely. The fish was not so good. It was under cooked, and very greasy. This place will likely die in a month, or two, unless they improve their processes."}
{"text":"First off the staff are amazingly attentive. The menu is pretty diverse and appealing. The food portions are very generous and the food itself is absolutely delicious. A great hidden treasure in Chandler, AZ. I know we will be frequenting the establishment a lot in the future.  I was too full to try the cobbler but it looked very good as well."}
{"text":"Really amazing food! I didn't think the portions were big enough at first, but wow we left satisfied and happy with our lunch. It's definitely going to become a regular place for us! Great food, the Mac and cheese is amazing, and friendly employees. I also loved all the art! We love supporting local businesses and this one is definitely worth a visit and then some!"}
{"text":"Pros: Real soul food, friendly staff.
Cons: Overpriced, takes a long time to get food.
Verdict: The food tasted okay (not great), but I left hungry. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"In chandler for a business trip. Wanted to try something different for a change. This place has awesome chicken. I also have never tasted mashed potatoes n gravy or beans n rice that had as much flavor as theirs. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. Oh, don't forget to top off your dinner with a delicious peach cobbler. I will definitely go back next time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while my wife was shopping. Got the special which pretty much included all meat options on the menu. Everything was perfect, great seasoning to the breading and it was light and not overwhelming. I'm not from the south but based on the Louisiana hot sauce on all the tables I would say it's a safe bet this is meant to be a southern fried kinda place. Mashed potatoes came with gravy that had sweet onions on the top, I ate two sides of them if that tells you how good they were. Missed the last sweet potato pie for my wife, other than that I'd say this joint is a must visit if you are a lover of fried chicken and fish!"}
{"text":"Update: I don't work in Chandler very often but when I do, I'm going here, and taking dinner home. Every. Single. Time. 

After wasting money at Popeyes on \"chicken\" that had been sitting under lights for hours and cold chewy fries... This place is awesome. Real food. Quality fresh chicken. I was happy to wait for a few minutes for freshly fried chicken. Sides were awesome too. Super clean. Super friendly. New go to place! Oh. And the peach cobbler. Eat that."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Ibby's when I was heading to my favorite Dollar Tree store.  The fish and chicken sign caught my eye as I was pulling into the parking lot of the shopping center.  Funny that I had never seen them before that day as I go to that center a few times a month.  Since I have been looking for a fast food restaurant that served catfish I thought I'd give them a try with no real expectations.  After a lengthy discussion with a beautiful gal behind the counter I ordered the fried catfish filet, greens, mac and cheese and candied yams.  Having grown up on M&M Soul Food out of Los Angeles and my mother in-law's cooking I was hoping that this meal would be just as tasty.  Boy was I surprised!!!  The catfish had a nice light cornmeal battered crust and the fish was cooked perfectly, not overcooked, and it didn't have that typical strong earthy taste that wild catfish can have.  The taste had some earthiness to it as it should but not overpowering as I suspect it is farm raised.  The mac and cheese was just as I like it.  Big shell macaroni, not elbow, and the cheese was thick and gooey, not runny. Next time I'm ordering a double helping of the mac and cheese!!  The candied yams were just the right amount of sweetness and dripping with juice.  Also not overbearing.  Lastly, the greens.  What can I say but superb!!!!  They were just the right amount of firmness, not wimpy, with a wonderful southern flavor and spice to them.  I found that the spiciness didn't not require any additional hot sauce as I often must add to other establishment's greens.

If you find yourself in the east valley you have to stop in at Ibby's.  Overall I give this place 3 thumbs up and will be making it my go to stop for all my catfish, mac and cheese and greens cravings I get frequently."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food and enjoyed the music.  We will be back!  The fish and chicken are the best we have had since leaving the south.  Thank you for the southern soul food!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. We had six different sides and all were delicious, hush puppies, collared greens, green beans, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and coleslaw. 

The service was awesome. The employees were very friendly and helpful. 

The bittersweet part was a long wait, but the food seemed fresh and hot so the wait was not a problem."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place several times but just kept forgetting about it when it came time to choose a restaurant. Today, Fathers Day we decided to try it. FANTASTIC! The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the food was very good and served fresh. We met Antwone and he treated us like we were regulars, very friendly. I had the fried chicken and my wife had the fried shrimp. I had to wait a while for the chicken as they cooked it fresh and let me tell you it was worth the wait!! Crispy and moist with just the right amount of seasoning. The shrimp was served with a cocktail sauce that was as good as it gets. The sides we ordered were red beans and rice, mac and cheese, green beans and hush puppies. The beans and rice were just OK but the rest were very good. The sweet potato pie was outstanding. We will definitely be back and will spread the word.  Much better than Lolo's!"}
{"text":"Good service and great food! The peach cobbler is bomb too! Clean location and the owner is real cool. 

the price is just right."}
{"text":"The food is great and always delicious. The owner Antwan is so nice and very hospitable. If you want a good home cooked meal this is the place!!"}
{"text":"My Lord! This food was so good til it had me wanting to slap MYSELF! I had the catfish lunch, which came with a generous piece of catfish and 2 sides. I chose collard greens and hush puppies for my sides. First of all, the catfish was freshly prepared and well seasoned, I tore it up in 60 seconds flat. Then, the collard greens were out of this world delicious, and perfectly seasoned with tender pieces of smoked turkey. The hush puppies were delicious...albeit a tiny bit overcooked, but not enough to take away from the fluffy, onion flavored middle. I saw the sweet potato pie, but I knew my high A1C wasn't gonna like that, but the nice woman at the counter saw me eyeing the pie, so she insisted I try it... I did, and it was over! The sweet potato pie had the perfect taste, without being too sweet, and the consistency was 100% on point, one bite instantly transported me back to my great grandma's southern kitchen! I WILL be back...probably later today!"}
{"text":"Catfish was Excellent. Had potato salad and the cole slaw as sides. Both very good. You won't go hungry. Partner had the chicken wings.  Kinda suprised us. We are use to Buffalo style-these we're whole wing. Nice breading though.  Peach cobble is Terrific. And taking Sweet Potato pie home"}
{"text":"Good food!  I went to Ibby's yesterday for the first time.  It's been a while since I last had Soul Food from a restaurant and was blown away.  The catfish was perfectly seasoned and fried.  The greens were excellent.  And the yams were 'like momma used to make.' Ordered through Yelp and was just about ready by the time I arrived.  Good food.  Good price.  Good people.  Efficient process.  Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is to die for, and let's not even talk about the sweet potatoe pie.  so good. They are nice and remember us when we went the first time. Clean and the music is always on point. way better then lolos on any day#"}
{"text":"Place smells funky! Was going to try it out,  but the guy couldn't even get off of his cell phone. He wanted to take the order with a pen in one hand, cell phone in the other. No thanks, you guys obviously make so much money that customer service doesn't matter."}
{"text":"I live in Ahwatukee there aren't any good local food place nearby until i find ibby fish and chicken, i always order 10-20 pieces of whole wings every time i go here and finish every single one of them! the chicken seasoned just right not too salty and not bland at all."}
{"text":"Tuesday lunch with the wife.  She was dying to have fried chicken, hush puppies and fried okra!
We love soul food so we thought we would give Ibby's a try.  Very friendly people working there, smiles, laughter and a welcoming tone.  She ordered fried chicken fingers with red beans and rice and hush puppies as they didn't have okra, oops, there goes half a star. Fried chicken done right is all I can say, lovely every delicious juicy bite!  The hush puppies were more than plentiful, about 7, and super delicious as well and the rice was good.  She asked if their peach cobbler was made with fresh peaches and with the \"yes\" we received it was ordered as well.  It was delicious and quite large. I ordered fish and had to choose from 4 species. I ordered fried Swai, collard greens and mac n cheese. The greens were among the best I have ever eaten, the fish was perfectly fried, the mac n cheese average. Worth 4 1/2 stars. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Always fresh and hot. Chicken is good. Shrimp is good. Catfish is good. Great sides and the desserts are homemade and fantastic."}
{"text":"This was some of the best \"soul food\" I've ever had. Came here on a date night because it was close to \"Lights of the World\" at Rawhide. I ordered the catfish nuggets dinner (comes with 3 sides, cornbread, and a drink). I chose buttered corn, yams, and Mac & cheese for my sides. The catfish was battered well and fried to perfection. It paired well with ketchup, tartar sauce, or hot sauce. My date also got the catfish nuggets, but will just 2 sides or Mac and cheese and collard greens.

Never having had collard greens I didn't have anything to compare it to, but they were delicious. My sides were exquisite. The yams had the right amount of brown sugar and cinnamon to be slightly sweet and spicy. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy. It was made with shells, not the \"normal\" pasta. The shells held the cheese well and were delicious surprises. The buttered corn was at it said buttery and plum good.

The establishment was clean, the staff was very helpful in recommendations as this was our first time there, and they were extremely friendly as well. We left full and very satisfied."}
{"text":"I love their chicken and fish. I mostly like their whiting fish. The peach cobbler with a side of vanilla ice cream is good too. The staff are friendly. I love the setting. I also really like that this place offers mild sauce. Mild sauce is rare to find in and around Phoenix. Mild sauce is mostly served in Chicago fast food places. I love that Ibbys has mild sauce."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for the first time.   I ordered the fried chicken and it was awesome.   I also had a piece of sweet potato pie. Amazing!!!! I will be back for a fish dinner."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at this establishment.   I always get nervous when I don't know how everything is going to taste and cost.  I must say...hot damn!  that was some good chicken!  I would arguably say the best fried chicken restaurant in the valley.  If you're visiting Chandler, it's a great place to stop by.  The staff is super friendly, the place is clean and crisp(no pun intended) and the prices were not outrageous.  It's definitely affordable but it doesn't compromise the quality of their dishes.  It's fried but not drenched in oil.  As a matter of fact, there was hardly any traces of oil.  They don't have an overwhelming menu, which makes it simple to order.  We will definitely be making a return to this place in the near future.  A breath of fresh air when it comes to finding delicious fried chicken."}
{"text":"Let me just say... THIS IS THE BEST FOOD I'VE HAD SONCE I'VE BEEN IN ARIZONA! I've been looking for a place with good home cooked food, hot fresh and delicious.. and Ibby's delivered! Not to mention the customer service was AMAZING! The music was great, the place was clean and smelled good. The whiting fish was amazing. Fried to perfection. The green beans and Mac&Cheese were seasoned and delicious! I'll definitely be a regular.. lol"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a restaurant that was like one from my hometown and I found it! this place is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Had chicken, fries, mac n cheese ... didnt realize the chicken was going to be bone-in.  I shudda asked.  Didnt love the fries or the chicken.  Mac was tasty.  Was hoping for more but it didnt really live up to what i had a hankering for."}
{"text":"Found a new Gem. 
Pros 
Food was really good and I am picky
Food came out hot and just as ordered 
Great portion size 
Peach cobbler ( very good as I even had to get one to go for later) 
Store was clean and well maintained 
Staff was very friendly and offered sample prior to ordering. 
Cons
I think I put on 2 pounds because I couldn't stop eating the mac in cheese
Only can and bottle drinks- cashier did tell me they are looking into fountain drinks."}
{"text":"My brother ordered food here. Surprisingly their chicken was bland. I would rather go to Popeyes, way better chicken. I feel their chicken was way greasy and had no salt and was just floured and fried. It seems that they can improve on their chicken. I might give this place another try, to try other options besides their fried chicken."}
{"text":"Ibby's fried chicken is pretty AMAZING! Please try the mild sauce, I swear you can put that sauce on cardboard and it will make you double dip."}
{"text":"I woke up craving real southern fried catfish. I walked in and knew I was in the right place. Perfectly fried and flaky. Red beans and rice were delicious. Hushpuppies were moist AND crunchy. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my family for fried chicken and sides. To Summarize in one word: Disappointed. 

The good: Guy behind the counter was very friendly. Chicken had good flavor.
The bad: The floor and tables were sticky. Food took a long time to come out (20 min). The chicken legs were very small, like oversized chicken wing small. The collards were salty.

Overall, it was a very \"meh\" experience for a premium price. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my experience here and honestly was a little upset to spend my money here. The food was nothing impressive and overly priced. Customer service was good."}
{"text":"Where do I start?

The place stayed consistently busy...a good sign.  The lady that originally greeted us wasn't the most pleasant person but wasn't rude either.

They messed our orders up as we both ordered fried chicken dinners, one with all wings and the other with all legs.  It took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive (based on the other reviews and the couple sitting in front of our table waiting and \"complaining\" about how long their order was taking expected it to be a much longer wait) and was pleasantly surprised.  

The surprises kept coming...even though they brought out the wrong pieces of chicken (we received a wing, 2 legs and a thigh) the chicken was out of this world good!  Hot and seasoned to perfection.  We also ordered a fish dinner and split it and the fish was amazingly good!  Our sides consisted of mashed potatoes and gravy, colored greens, mac n cheese, green beans and hush puppies.

The colored greens were perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of flavor!  The mashed potatoes were very tasty and real!  Mac n cheese was good, different but good.  Green beans weren't the best and I wasn't a fan of the hush puppies.

So why 5 stars?  Try the chicken, fish, taters and colored greens and you'll know why!"}
{"text":"Good soul food period. Mac & cheese, collard greens and chicken were on point. Tried the whiting fish as well, pretty darn good. The batter is what makes the difference and this place keeps pace with Mrs. Whites without doubt. Brings back Oakland memories. Price point a little high, but I think that is to be expected these days. $19.00 for fish and chicken combo lunch with iced tea but I left very full and could probably have a few cocktails instead of dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken!!  First time here and will be going back.  Peach cobbler is sooooooo good, best I have had in AZ.  Antoine could not have been a nicer guy.  Delicious food, good service, what else can Girl ask for??"}
{"text":"Excellent! The fried catfish was fried to perfection. The collard greens, candied yams, and mac and cheese sides were hot, fresh, and delicious. My one year old won't eat mac and cheese unless it's cooked correctly. He ate every bite.

My husband ordered the chicken tenders, but there weren't any ready to cook. He was given a few other choices, and he chose fried chicken thighs. The waitress gave him 2  complementary cornbread muffins (delicious). We left full and satisfied.

Antoine gave us an extra piece of sweet potato pie. I'm too stuffed to eat it right now, but if the pie is similar to the candied yams, it's gonna be delicious!"}
{"text":"Stay away scary movie they sold the Restraunt. I was served raw chicken and boiled noodles that was supposed to be Mac n cheez they have no idea what they are doing went back for my replacement food was still trash and I spoke with the owner who buys a Restraunt without the recipes smh"}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place as it had rave reviews here on yelp, but I guess you can't trust everything you read or just based on my own opinion. Fried chicken was tasteless needed more seasoning for extra flavor. It did have the crunch that all fried chicken needs. Cole slaw and Mac-and-cheese was not anything to rave about as it tasted bland. 

Customer service great though, hence the extra star given. Will pay this place another visit to try out the other menu items as it has some praise from other yelpers!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different check out this great little place. The food is actually HANDMADE and FRESH!! A rare find that is worth the visit. Good flavors and friendly service. Enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"First off I waited to review Ibby's because 1. I'm lazy, 2. I thought I didn't need to as the food and reputation should speak for itself. Then I finally read some reviews and now feel I NEED to do one. So, I started coming here when Ibby's moved to new management and Antoine took over. My husband told me we should try it, and so we did and have been coming here ever since. All food is cooked to order, which I love way better than chicken or fish that sits under a lamp! So this means it will be a minimum of 10 mins and that's okay with me. My food has always been delicious, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I can speak to the juiciness of the fried chicken and delicious baked smothered turkey legs. The rice is amazing and I'm really picky about my rice as I prefer Jasmine. The gravy is amazing to not have any flour in it! I don't do cheese so I can't speak to the macaroni and cheese taste, but my husband and kids love it! The macaroni from what I hear has changed along the way and I think that's because Ibby's listens to their patrons and learns from any past inconsistencies. I love that with every meal you get a free drink and I believe the prices fall in line with soul food/fish fry places from where I'm from which is the Bay Area. The generous 3 sides with dinners are very filling. The greens are clean, tasty and not runny and freezer-like and not over seasoned. When I come here I have many dishes. Usually when I have a place that I love to go to I only have one dish that's my favorite. At Ibby's on any given day I can order from at least 5 different meals. I love the catfish, the fried chicken, the baked chicken, the baked turkey legs and shrimp! The sweet potatoes and cobbler are my favs as well and you will not be disappointed! I've also been to other restaurants nearby (Ezekiel's/LoLo's) and I honestly can't find one that compares. When we first started going there I was really antisocial. But everyone there makes you feel like family and they'll remember you if you go often. If you personally had a problem with your order, speak to Antoine, he will make sure you walk out pleased. The best part about eating here is that I don't leave feeling overwhelmingly heavy and guilty. Have you ever ate fried chicken or fish and felt bogged down afterwards? That's what I love about the cooking here! They deliver AND you can call ahead to place your order! It's been challenging for me to find a place where the food is as good as its rumored to be. I've found that place in Ibby's!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I love fish and I love soul food. I was excited because the positive yelp reviews.  I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant before.   I arrived with my wife just after 5pm on a Saturday night. Business was light when we ordered, but quickly picked up. I ordered the Catfish dinner and she ordered the chicken tenders. For sides we went with fries, hush puppies, and mac n' cheese. We were told it would be about 15 minutes. 58 minutes later our food arrived.  Yep, you read that right. 58 minutes later.  And if that wasn't enough the chicken tenders were so overcooked that you literally could not bite into them. The fish arrived lukewarm. The hush puppies were also drastically overcooked. And the mac n' cheese was cold. So cold that the cheese had solidified and formed a film on top of it.   As we were leaving the couple sitting beside us asked what we thought about the food because it was their first time there as well. While we were talking the (I assume) manager approached and asked how our food was because he could we were not happy. To his credit, he offered to give us something else to try to make things right but I just did not have another hour to wait for cold, overcooked, bland food."}
{"text":"We found Ibby's on Yelp while searching for fish and ate there this evening. The reviews raved about the catfish and also the soul food and home cooked sides. Ibby's is a fish & chicken joint with soul. You can get the fish & chicken many ways and even have some collard greens. The mac & cheese side is delicious. The fish though is really fresh, and we had catfish & whiting, along with fries, mac, green beans, candied yam and collard. The music is outstanding and really gives the place character. If you like WBGO's Saturday morning rhythm review you will love it here."}
{"text":"Just ate some bomb ass fried chicken and catfish!  Collards done to perfection. Did this girl right  rounded it off with some fluffy donut magic pillows @boba and donuts next door. Time for a food coma  #FatKidHeaven #ThankGodTheyreNotInTucsonIdBeHuge"}
{"text":"I love Ibbys. The food is great, reasonably priced, and the staff is very friendly . If you're on this part of town, I highly recommend you check them out. Even if you live in the west valley,you have to make it out here at least once a month. Trust me, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place cause it's close to work and yelp reviews were good. But 6 of us went at noon on a Friday, it was busy and very hot in inside, it took 30 minutes to all get our orders taken, the cash register drawer got stuck twice when ordering, then took another 30min to get all our food. 
Food: I wanted the equivalent of a fish and chips. She suggested the white fish with fries and coleslaw. The fish was over fried, with skin still on it, yuck... made it taste fishy, the fries tasted like fish and the Cole slaw was mushy. My coworkers said they would not come back. And they had no home made tarter sauce. I guess soul food experience was not that good."}
{"text":"I got overcooked dried out fried chicken.. The fried fish was mushy.. The fries were horrible.. The only things that were any good was the coleslaw and mashed potatoes and gravy"}
{"text":"The food was INSANELY delicious, one of the BEST places in Arizona , and definitely my favorite. The customer service was a 10/10, the workers there were very nice and the food came out really fast! The restraunt was also very clean and tidy. The food was perfectly cooked and  DELICIOUS. Idk what that girl is talking ¯\_(?)_/¯, i ordered the jumbo fried shrimp with a side of FRENCH FRIES??!!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!! It was soooo good, i ordered an extra to go to eat again for dinner, the shrimp were perfectly cooked from the inside and the french fries were like home made, crunchy outside soft inside ,which are the best fries.and the chefs give generous amounts of food which is always a plus, this place is on my list of the top 3 restraunts in AZ. Will DEFINITELY go back to it ASAP!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Absolutely the best Catfish We have had! It had a golden batter that was seasoned just right. The sides were quite tasty as well, with a lot to choose from. I went with sweet yams and hush puppies. Both were delicious! This is a small friendly place with the best 'soul food.'  We will be  frequent fliers here for sure!"}
{"text":"Finally, a good soul food restaurant in The Valley! The service is outstanding and the fried shrimp and fried catfish are awesome! I like the flavor of the greens, but they contain mostly stems! When I make greens I like to cook the leaves and not the stems. I realize that it's easier to by bags of greens instead of \"picking\" your own, but I wish soul food restaurants would consider ditching greens in a bag! 

My husband loved the mac & cheese, but I'm not a fan. I prefer old fashioned mac & cheese with pockets of cheese and not the creamy sauce. However, despite those two things, it's awesome! A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Whiting fish EVER!  Yum yum!! Sooo good. Crisp, crunchy, seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"There are not many places in Chandler with good fish.  Ibby's is the best!!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok, so where to begin???  First off, when I took my first bite of their mac-n-cheese...I needed moment.  I mean I REALLY needed a moment.  I'm sure the folks in the room next to me are trying to understand why I was crying for over 35 minutes.  Tears of joy I'm telling ya, tears of joy!

This is a very interesting place.  Totally-totally legit on the fried goods, and trust me, if you're jones'en for some true, real, authentic southern-style fried cook'en, you've found your new home.  And again...in F**king Chandler???  I am getting sick of this place having all these little hidden nuggets.  But wow...the food was amazing.  

First off, I was warmly greeted by two different extremely nice young ladies...who had no problem selling me on trying the Fish...a fish I've actually never heard of before (Whiting Fish) but was pretty similar to a good quality Cod).  I also Tried their friend shrimp and friend chicken. Now, don't panic America, I didn't even come close to finishing it all but boy I gave it my best shot.  Oh and did I mentioned I also have a freshly made Peach Cobbler sitting next to me, waiting for me to finish this admn review so I can eat it??  Wait...wait for it...yep, just took a bite and holy S**t...now that's cobbler!  WOW....this place deserves 10 stars, seriously.  

All kidding aside, the food here is amazing.  It's thoughtful, generous to a fault and hits many various notes from great eating memories from your past...that is if you've had the opportunity to eat this sort of delightfully well thought out and sincere home cook'en before.  I'm still shaking my head here...at how amazing the chicken was.  So moist, perfectly seasoned and the batter...the batter...Jesus Mary Jane....where to start?  The Fish and Shrimp were also off the hook - no pun intended.  Places like this normally have one or two things they nail but Ibby's hit a game-ending grand-slam with two outs...I'm telling you, this place it totally legit!  

God I hate Chandler!  I'm so frigg'en jealous!  :()"}
{"text":"Now I know this was a great place to come to. I'm a Texan southern girl and love my fried chicken or fried anything I should say. The catfish was great, it came with three sides and cornbread. Red beans and rice, Mac and Cheese & Fries. Mac and cheese was amazing along with the red beans and rice! Fries..well they're fries. It's a very small home feeling when you go in there. Yes you have to wait for fresh cooked food! Just like you would at home if you were to cook. I don't mind waiting for good fresh food! The peach cobbler is ouuuuuuut of this freaking world!!!! Must get it and take it home if you have to. I definitely recommend this place if you want home made southern soul food."}
{"text":"We went after seeing other reviews here on yelp and as usual it was just as good as it was made out to be by you all that have already discovered it.  Between me and my wife we tried just about everything on the menu it seemed. We didn't of course but we did try enough different things to be able to see if this would become one of our places to go to on a regular basis. The peach cobbler and the sweet potato pie are to die for. They are a must have in my book. The best thing we had was the chicken strips with a side of there homemade mild sauce. And the macaroni and cheese, the red beans and rice, and the mashed potatoes were awesome as well. And the colored greens where even good and I don't like them or sweet potato pie. At least I didn't tell I tried it here. Overall I would say go try it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Never tried this place but decided to since they were donating 15% to Boba & Donuts (because of the accident). I WILL absolutely be a repeat customer. They were packed and the food still came out quickly! It was absolutely delicious and great portion sizes. 

I had tenders, green beans and mac n cheese. Best green beans I have ever tasted hands down! Ordered some shrimp too, they are huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Freshly fried chicken....can't get fresher than this! Placed our order for a chicken - that was 8 large pieces and a kids order of chicken strips. While it did take time (we have to remember frying up chicken and cooking it takes time!) it was every bit worth the wait! They made our chicken after we ordered it....no sad chicken under a heat lamp for us  The chicken had flavor and was moist! The left over pieces were devoured by my son the next day - guess day old chicken was delicious  
We got a large drink (no size issue here) and since the ice machine was broken, we were given cups of ice for our drink and water. 
The place is simple but with time and more business, I bet they can spruce up the place. 
I'd suggest call in your order so it's piping hot for pick up or for you to arrive and dig in!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely real soul food. It doesn't try to do anything any extravagant. Just simple and great tasting."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goddess. The food is amazing!! Best soul food I've ever had. So many sides to choose from. The chicken was crispy and juicy but not greasy. The homemade sauce is 10 out of 10. The service is fantastic"}
{"text":"So it's still the best place near me for Catfish, but....

Ibby's is under new management, and the quality is falling off.  I absolutely loved this place, and ate there about once a week.  My go to meal is the Fried Catfish with Red Beans and Mac and Cheese as my sides.  The Catfish was very good, but has fallen off only slightly.  The sides are really suffering.  The Red Beans is un-inspiring now and was above average before.  What has really suffered is the Mac and Cheese, it used to be wondrous, but what I had on my most recent visit was dry, bland, and even had areas that were burnt.

I loved Ibbys, but after another disappointing meal or two like my most recent, and I'll be moving to the \"Taste of Louisianna\" which is just across the parking lot.

Please new Ibby's management, stop cutting corners and bring back the good stuff!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chicken I've had west of southern Illinois!  My go to place!  Delish sweet potato pie greens etc etc."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and it lives up to the hype! The chicken was authentic and delicious! All of the food was fresh, and the owner was amazing and very welcoming. Will for sure be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I've heard this place was a good but a long wait. So Monday I tried to call ahead to place an order. Called three times and nobody picked up. Drove across town only to find out that they weren't even open even though posted hours on yelp stated open 4-8pm...arrived shortly after 5pm."}
{"text":"First, all good food, fresh cooked food will have a wait. If you want Popeyes - food in 3 min - then go to Popeyes.

We ordered the Chicken, Catfish and Shrimp dinner. The shrimp was amazing, perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned and jumbo in size.

Catfish - again, perfectly cooked and tasty, fresh fried.

Chicken - Legit home cooked, tastes like mom made it. and there's no messy kitchen for me to clean! Again, perfectly fried. 

Mac and cheese isn't the blue box, it's a real cheesy sauce - not overly \"cheddar\" like others. Very good.

Red beans and rice - WOW - fresh again! Kudos to this place.

Candied yams and butter were good, but not sure if those ever get messed up. 

Sweet Potato Pie....JUST go! Even if you aren't hungry - go and get a slice of pie!!! SO GOOD!

The meats and pie were on par with Mary Mac's. (A spot in ATL that is a must if you love soul food)

Support local businesses, they're small and charming, which means you'll wait a little longer than ordering from a chain. The employees are kind and genuinely want you to enjoy the food.

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Review 2/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016 

Ibby, you make a mighty tasty fried chicken and fish! I was feeling particularly gluttonous today and decided to get a to-go order of fried catfish and chicken. The order was ready in 15 minutes and well packaged for me to take it back.

The combo came with 2 sides. I went with the collard greens and mac and cheese. The order came with a small container of hot sauce, tartar sauce, plenty of napkins, and utensils. 

The fish and chicken had slightly different batter to go with the each meat, and both were delicious. The crispy coating was light and well seasoned. The combo came with one piece of fish and 2 pieces of dark meat chicken (Leg and thigh). There wasn't a lot of meat on the chicken and some parts of the unbattered thigh were dried out but the rest of the meat was tender. The fish was very fresh and had a very soft texture to go with the crispy coating. If I had to choose between the two, I'd prefer the fried fish over the chicken.

As for the sides, the mac and cheese was an excellent rendition of perfectly cooked pasta and creamy cheesy sauce. The collard greens were too vinegary/salty for my tastes though.

Service was very warm and friendly. The total price was $15+ with tax which I felt was a little expensive for what I got. The overall quality of the food though was great and I look forward to going here again for more Southern style dishes."}
{"text":"Have eaten here multiple times. Quality of food is consistent.  Food is seasoned well. Peach cobbler is good. Sweet potato pie was a little too sweet, but good. Is the go to spot if you are in the Ahwatukee or Chandler area."}
{"text":"I have stopped here a couple times now. I have ordered the chicken strips and the nuggets. Everything has been good and the people there are very friendly. I'm going to go back to try the shrimp next."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was so crispy and juicy. We always get the family meal and it such a good deal. The Mac and Cheese is the real deal. The greens are solid and the peach cobbler is to die. Every time I'm in the area I stop at Ibbys.  Did I mention the food is so good. Last but not least the customer service is friendly and fast. You can't ask for anymore. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This is the best soul food in the E Valley!  True home cooking, it has a fast food look but don't be surprised, everything is made to order.  No chicken sitting under a heat lamp.. bring your appetite and  call ahead if you are in a hurry as chicken takes 15-20 min to cook as it would in any great restaurant.  This ain't KFC...
The pies are amazing make sure you try them.. 
I can't say enough, just make it a point to get over here... the donut place next door is solid too...FYI"}
{"text":"We visited this establishment because of the rave reviews on yelp. We did have a positive experience but it wasn't 5-star worthy, I'd say. We will be back and maybe they can earn that 5th star. A few things - the vibe of the staff was inconsistent. Some very friendly and others with a bit of attitude that made it uncomfortable to be in their presence. We ordered a family meal and were disappointed with the size of the two sides that came with the family meal. They were not family meal size but appeared to be individual sized sides and since we did takeout it was too late for me to order more by the time I noticed there wasn't enough for everyone. The food was generally very good and the restaurant itself, although small, is clean and comfortable. The yelp check-in discount was an unexpected pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"THE CLOSEST YOU'll GET TO SOUL FOOD IN AZ! The chicken was freshly fried and was so good! I also had mac and cheese, candied yams, greens and sweet potatoe pie and they were just as delicious!! This was my first time here but I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We ate here with our friends and kids tonight and loved it!   This is a great local spot with friendly owners and staff who take pride in their food and service.  We enjoyed the charcoal and ink drawings on the walls while we were pleasantly surprised by the lightly battered fish that stayed crispy and the \"mild sauce,\" which had a smoky tart flavor that made everything even more delicious.  We had the swai and catfish & both were fresh and well portioned.  The kids had chicken tenders which also had a delicious light batter that did not weigh the meat down.  The collard greens were made with smoked turkey instead of ham or bacon which was another flavorful twist.  Everything added up to a delightful experience & we will be back!"}

{"text":"Sooooooooo GOOD! Authentic , delicious, and good prices! It's the best food I have had yet, in Arizona.  The red beans and rice was perfect! The catfish and shrimp were fresh cooked. No heat lamps in this place. Home cooked deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Ibby's is a hole in the wall with character. Their food is delicious and the folks running it are delightful. They have the art of a friend on the walls that gives it a nice down to earth ambience. It reminds me a little bit of the first little Lo Lo's, but I have not seen a home cooking restaurant like this in Chandler before.

I had the swai Fish dinner which was very reasonably priced and delicious. And our son had chicken strips which he and a friend gobbled down until they were full and then us adults started gobbling them down until we were full :-)

I'm looking forward to more fish and chicken dinners here and looking forward to trying their sweet potato pie which I love!"}
{"text":"Excellent Swai fired (Asian cat fish) mild flaky fish; good tartar sauce and nice fried chicken; we also picked up sweet potato pie to take home.  Go here for local food and nice service."}
{"text":"Fish, wings, chicken, and shrimp pretty much sums it up. The choices for fish are Tilapia and catfish. They have traditional or boneless wings,  fried shrimp, fried chicken, and chicken nuggets. They do serve a variety of different appetizers and side dishes to go with the meals. 

Now for my 1 star rating...I originally ordered Catfish nuggets. When my meal came out they brought me a whole catfish. I looked at my receipt and showed them I wanted the nuggets. They took the food away and began making what I ordered. Mind you the food is made to order and took about 15 minutes to make in the first place so now I have to wait another 10 minutes for them to remake my meal. When the food finally arrived they brought me my food and told me the have me a few extra nuggets. I thought that was a nice gesture but they let the same sides they had given me before on my place so it was not fresh and it was cold. I ate the catfish nuggets expecting it to satisfy the hunger pains since I had waited so long for my food to come out. What a disappointment. The fish was so bland, no flavor, no seasoning and smelled like it was fresh out the ocean. Beware of the fish I would not recommend. I was with 2 other people and 1 order chicken nuggets which were pretty good. We had to ask for sauce because they never asked us.  My other friend order jumbo shrimp. He loved the shrimp. This was probably the best thing out of everything that we ordered. It came with fries but the fries didn't have any salt on them and tasted like they were cooked in bad grease. The baked beans were hard and dried out like they had been reheated in the microwave several times. It's too bad this place didn't work out I was excited to see a new restaurant to try.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Everything was good but the chicken and macaroni was the best will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation. He wasn't kidding... this place is great and worth the short drive from Ahwatukee. 

This place was uhMAZing. The fish... fried to perfection, tasted so fresh and not greasy. I had catfish and my hubbie had whiting, I think it was called. Getting that next time -- you get more and it takes less time than the catfish. They post the prep times on the board. Sides were delish. Best cole slaw we've had in AZ. Yum. Portions were generous.

Also can't wait to try the chicken."}
{"text":"Marvelous fried chicken, shrimp and fish here.  The potato salad and coleslaw are home made.  I loved every bite.  Good and friendly service too."}
{"text":"First off I have to give thanks to Yelp for recommending this place. I literally work down and the street and always seen this place when walking into Walmart. I'm so glad I made a stop in, I ordered the chicken tenders and mac n cheese. Let's just say the Food is on point! I can't wait to come back and try the Cat fish."}
{"text":"I did a to go order from Here.. saw it on yelp and decided to check it out.. love everything that I got from here. The chicken is very crispy and the two sides I got were both delicious.. one of the best mac and cheese I had in awhile.. the two ladies working the front were very friendly .. don't forget to check in on yelp you will get a 10% off ur bill :) can't wait to come back to try other things they have to offer"}
{"text":"The tilapia and chicken with the mild sauce were delicious!!! We also tried the rice with gravy which was also amazing. Great food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Talk about amazing chicken! This place has everything you need to experience great tasting chicken and at a good price as well. They offer wings, fries, different cuts and anything else you normally experience from a fried chicken spot. The only difference is that they prepare their chicken fresh daily and you can truly taste the difference! This is my new go to spot for fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Chicken was a little greasy and bland for my taste, but the sides were delicious (greens and mac & cheese).  I'd try it again but maybe with a different entree."}
{"text":"Great service, great attitudes, great food!! The collard greens are crisp & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've come to Ibby's so many times I think I should have an honorary plaque on the wall over a chair... that's how much I luv coming here.

I started coming last year and the 1st thing I jumped on was the variety of lunch combos. My favorites, fried chicken and the catfish nuggets... but every time I come, I'm bringing friends, family and coworkers as they are always looking for a great comfort food spot with some soul and I highly recommend

Ibbys is that comfort soul place in my neighborhood.  The staff is always friendly and if you get stuck not knowing what to order, just let them put together a combo plate that I'm sure will hit the spot. 

I've had just about everything on the menu from fried chicken, variations of fish and shrimp... haven't been disappointed yet

All food is cooked to order with the exception of a few sides that require some time and effort to get right. Give yourself some time. The Mac & Cheese, greens and fries are my go to sides, but decided to switch it up a few times for the red beans and rice or the candy yams. All good choices.

Over the holidays we found ourselves picking up both the homemade sweet potato pies and what I consider the most off the hook desert, the peach cobbler. When I first came last year, I was spoiled as I got 2 pieces the same day. I noticed people were calling and coming in to get cobbler just because they were in the area or checkin in to see if hey had some slices. It's that good!!! 

TV's are on the wall to entertain but the food will be the center piece... set aside some time for lunch (or dinner) and come through!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you enjoy soul food. I had a catfish dinner here and let me say it was pretty good. In Arizona finding a decent soul food place is hard but this is def one if them. Macaroni and cheese was on point and the fish was fried perfectly and seasoned well."}
{"text":"This place never misses. The candy yams are legit delicious. The fried chicken wings and fried swai are my favorites. The staff is very friendly and the service is great. The wife is in love with the collard greens and fried shrimp. We go here often and the food and service is always on point."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food.  Highly recommend the combo.. delicious fish and chicken. 

Side recommendations:
Mac and cheese
Red beans and rice


Dessert:
Peach cobbler


Inside vibes:
Great laid back vibes."}
{"text":"OK I think I found my catfish restaurant. I had their catfish lunch with fries and Coleslaw.  The fish was cooked perfectly with a good battery taste that was light and not over powering. The coleslaw was simply yummy and fries just the way I like them. The only knock would be the packets of tartar sauce, I would much prefer small tubs of tarter sauce and perhaps made on site. 

Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"We came here because my boyfriend was craving peach cobbler. He said the peach cobbler is good, he bought 2 and just finished the first one. I got the sweet potato pie and it's delicious. We will definitely  be back to try other things on the menu! Glad to have a soul food restaurant in our neighborhood. Also, great customer service, that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Is there a gas leak in AHW? I must be the only person on Yelp that thought the food here was ghastly. I'm from the east coast and have had many different variations of soul food (down south, up north, you name it), including my own mama's who KNOW how to throw down on some...and nothing I have ever had was as bad as Ibby's. I hate to have to do this to a black owned business...but what's up sis?? Why the fried chicken dang near evaporate into crunchy dust when my SO tried to eat it? Why did the mac have zero flavor aside from the ground pepper? Why was the cornbread hard as a rock and flavorless? The yams were swimming in juice, couldn't even pick them up with a fork. The only things I could say were decent would have to be the hush puppies and greens, and even then it was like someone popped the top off of a salt shaker and dumped the whole thing into the mix. Now I know the clientele here may have never had soul food before so this is \"revolutionary\" to them...but, there is a right way to do it...and it isn't done here. Also...why was a chicken meal and some sides $27? I have so many questions and so much disappointment."}
{"text":"Well, all change is not good change. 
I first visited ibby' s in November of last year and was really impressed and glad to find a piece of the Midwest.  The portions were enormous (enough to feed 3 people off one meal) and the staff was friendly and attentive.  
But let's fast forward to last week, which is the reason for my opening sentence. I stopped in to get my Midwest fix, learning just moments before that the management had changed but i didn't let that stop me.  But almost right away I had to raise an eyebrow. I ordered a simple 2 meat combo and two sides. I had to repeat my order a few times. I didn't look at my meal before leaving and totally regret that decision.  Mind you I mentioned the enormous portions.  The meal I came home to was more like a kids meal and lacked flavor. I didn't notice a change in price which I should have given the lack of food I received.  Between the food and the interaction I had (they told me they were from the Midwest - they aren't) I will no longer be visiting this establishment, they dont deserve to inherit the customers that the previous owners worked for."}
{"text":"This is near my job and wanted to try it. It was after my lunch hour so wait wasn't long. I haven't had soul food in a long time since I was in South Central L.A. but this is the best! I tried the fish meal combo with fried catfish, mac&cheese, collards, rice&beans, and a drink. Judging by a Yelp photo, I thought it came with corn bread but I didn't get one. Anyway, I plan to try the chicken meal combo on my next visit. And the free DBacks game tickets is a nice touch!.. . :)

Update: I returned after work just as they closed but let me in willing to make what they had left. I got their baked chicken meal combo with rice&gravy, corn, green beans, candied yams, and drink. Also got the sweet potato pie everyone raves about, and the owner Antoine threw in an extra one! They were out of corn bread but he promised to take care of me next time. I'm not a particular fan of green beans but these are the best tasting I've ever had! Plan to get more and try the fried chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Chicken was too salty and overall bland.  Potato salad was also a bust, threw both away."}
{"text":"This is the real deal!! I heard about it at the tail end of a radio show and decided to check it out. I had the fried catfish dinner and lemme just say - it was outstanding. Large portion that was fried to perfection. I had sides of candied yams and greens. I am from the south and feel like I know greens pretty well. Ibbys' greens were perfection. The candied yams left me wanting more - perfectly sweet and a good foil to the fried fish. Be sure to ask for the house sauce if you go. I tried to decipher the flavors - sweet, spicy and smoky - to no avail. Trust me - it's fantastic though. Dessert was sweet potato pie - homemade. Unlike most commercial sweet potato pies, this felt like the filling had been whipped. It was lighter than I expected but still had the fall flavor that it's known for. Ibbys is hidden a bit off Kyrene and Chandler Blvd. but it definitely a gem. We will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I walked in with a buddy of mine right before closing on a Saturday night. The door was locked and we were super bummed we missed out. But, the owner came and opened the door before I could get back in my truck and insisted that we come in! 

I'm so glad he did! He made us a fresh batch of chicken, it's always made fresh... No heat lamps here. He even gave us some bbq chicken to try while we waited. Fall off the bone delicious! The fried checked was super crisp and perfectly seasoned. Everything was awesome, from the Mac and cheese to the collard greens and all the sides in between.

Please give this local place a shot! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stop by this spot on a recommendation.  Had the whiting fish dinner and it was off the chain. Met the owner Anton who is down to earth and cares about people. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite soul food restaurant!  The food is amazing and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. I've gone all the way to Phoenix to another popular soul food restaurant, but hands down Ibby's is so much better. The restaurant is clean and I love that you can watch how the prepare your food. Please don't hesitate to give them a try...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great little soul food spot. I think we eat here everytime we come to Phx. Most the of time we call ahead and do pickup. Today we dined in today. The lady behind the counter was very friendly. So the catfish is amazing!!!!! Greens are great!!!! I am small town girl from Louisiana so this spot is perfect and always leaves me with a smile."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this authentic soul food eatery while in the Chandler area for business. The service at the counter was friendly and helpful. My fried chicken and catfish nuggets combo order with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes was delicious. I went back to the counter to get a bottle of water and the owner/manager offered it at no cost."}
{"text":"This food here is the TRUTH! Everything is fresh made. I got the wings and they were hot and fresh. I tried the chicken and rice and it's like Mom used to make. The green beans were amazing and the red beans and rice had me speechless. Friendly service and great music playing! This is a cool place."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here, and it was absolutely amazing. I had the chicken lunch entree (tenders with a side of Mac n cheese and fries) along with a slice of sweet potato pie. The portion size was very large, and the food was delicious. Everything was very fresh, and they cooked the chicken and fries to order (and the mac n cheese and pie had clearly been made only just before I walked in). The food was full of flavor. The staff were all extremely friendly and chatted with me as I ate. I will absolutely be back soon to try the fish."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to find some seafood to eat on a Friday for Lent and I remembered hearing about this restaurant when their neighbors, Boba and Donuts had a car crash into their store front and Ibby's donated a percentage of their sales to them. I got the 2 meat combo with fried chicken and fried shrimp with mac and cheese and hush puppies, my husband got the fried cat fish, fried shrimp with collar greens and rice and gravy. We've only really had \"soul\" food at LoLo's Chicken and Waffles so to try out a local business we didn't know what to expect. The service was awesome from the get-go, the lady that took our order was really nice. Antoine, who I think might have been the owner or manager was super nice too. We used a Yelp check-in to get 10% off our bill and this eldery lady before us who was waiting for her order overheard my discount and started asking the lady at the counter how she could get 10% off too. Rather than getting mad and annoyed, she directed the lady to download the Yelp app and helped her out and they would process a refund for her which I thought was super nice. If I were them, I would have said \"sorry lady, you'll need to use that for next time you visit, we're not going to waste our time showing you how to get a 10% discount on something you already paid for\" hehe :) anyways! The food is made fresh and came out piping hot, so I would warn anybody who is in a hurry for their meal because it will take some time. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy and the skin was super crispy, just the way I like it! the shrimp were nice and big and the hush puppies were great. The mac and cheese was amazing and probably one of the best I've had in a long time. We've never had collar greens before but decided to try it and wow they are good!!!!!!!!! I can't even describe the flavor but it was tasty. My husband enjoyed his cat fish and shrimps and overall we had a great dinner. I noticed they had sweet potato pie and peach cobbler and I don't think I've ever tried any of those so I ended up getting both. Antoine gave me some peach cobbler from the warm batch and my husband and I loved both desserts! We will definitely be back again soon and recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried them."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I've had take out and I've sat in for lunch and dinner. The entire staff is very welcoming . It reminds me of a soul food restaurant back east! I love the art on the walls and I love that they offer halal options! Easily a local favorite since it's hard to find good soul food in the valley!"}
{"text":"I had a last minute need for a dessert and Antoine was there to rescue me. Peach cobbler for a crowd. Fresh and hot and better than mom's. (Sorry mom but it's true). We will definitely be back to try the other offerings!"}
{"text":"This has always been a place I go for some good fried chicken and soul food. Unfortunately, the food is no longer the same under new management. Not only my chicken size becomes much smaller (as seen on photos), the seasoning is just not the same or as tasty. Even the side dishes taste completely different. 

Since they are still new, I wish them best of luck. I might try again in a few months to see if there is an improvement on the size of the food and their flavor."}
{"text":"The best soul food place in the Valley of the Sun. Sweet potato pie is stellar. My favorite sides are the collard greens and mac and cheese. Shrimp and fish fried perfectly. Forget about that other fried chicken place, get to Ibbys Now."}
{"text":"I moved from Chicago to Chandler,  AZ 6 months ago and I have been looking for some good fried chicken and catfish. Well I found that and more. Everything I've had so far has been delicious. They have a sweet potato pie that makes believe that my mother is in Ibby's kitchen instead of heaven. Ibby's will be the place of my cheat meal at least once a week. I highly recommend Ibby's to everyone who's looking for some good old fashioned home cooked fried chicken and soul food sides. Oh, and the customer service is A-1."}
