{"text":"Great price. Great quality. Meet my brother there and was very surprised with how good it was based on the prices."}
{"text":"Great sushi and hibachi dishes! More of a take out place but they do have a small dining area"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a nice little gem in \"The Burg\"! A must try. They have about 6 tables to eat in or you can carry out."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go and the service was fast. They have good food and prices. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 5 star rating based on it being a \"take out\" kind of place (even though there are a couple tables to sit at). The service is friendly. Food is good (both sushi and hibachi). Very happy there is a place like this in Harrisburg to grab sushi when I am craving it. Try the Lotus on Fire roll. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"So I think I started eating here almost a year ago when the owner of this place bought it from the owner of Ishi in University City. Since then, he's made a ton of improvements, and the food has always been delicious.

Pretty decent prices, and the portions are huge. The steak and chicken hibachi meal is a pretty big dinner, and you can always call ahead and order and they'll have it ready in 5-10 mins.

I've been searching for a decent hibachi place in Charlotte, and aside from Hasaki Grill in uptown, this place is by far the best, biggest, and most convenient hibachi in the area."}
{"text":"Really excellent food - better quality than Yama by Concord Mills at a much lower price. The staff are friendly and helpful. I had sushi & my husband got sesame chicken. Not much ambiance, but the food was good enough that this will definitely be my go to Japanese restaurant from now on!"}
{"text":"In my opinion,the rice (fried) always determines if I will return to a restaurant or not.Well,I must say,Ichi has great rice.I ordered the habachi chicken and it was very flavorful.Sometimes express Japanese can be a hit or miss but this spot will now be my new stop.Even their shrimp sauce and ginger dressing has a unique flavor.Stop by the next time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for super-fast asian takeout. I literally have to order on the way there because they have it ready so fast. We frequently get the teriyaki chicken or salmon with mixed veggies. Egg rolls are solid. They started serving sushi after a recent remodel and it was on point. I think I got something called the B.S. roll and it was really good ;-) You can eat there but it is small inside. The recent remodel makes it nicer to dine in if you so choose."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this spot for Japanese for awhile!  It used to be different owners from what I've heard- and never seemed to be open- so we always just kept driving....but we noticed a change and finally tried it!

This is a quick grab and go hibachi place in a small plaza, right on 49 near 49 yard line bar.  There's a few tables inside, but it seems like most of the business is \"to go\".  They have the typical hibachi and teriyaki meals, but also had a \"ichi\" that says a white garlic sauce which I'd like to try!  Portions were good, and food was on par with most places like this.  They also have a sushi menu, which we may try next time!

With the lack of options in Harrisburg, it's nice that we can stay in town to get some decent Japanese takeout.  Don't go for experience or ambiance, but if you are hungry.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for quite some time now under the new owners. We've always ordered a child's hibachi chicken which came with rice and a vegetable cooked with the chicken. No carrots, which I was okay with. The last time i got this I was hassled about the rice. This time they said no rice, no vegetables... Really... Hibachi chicken and that's it! Fu Shing is fine with me.  I'm done with the confused owners of Ichi. And the chick with the braces is clueless and rude."}
{"text":"Hot Dang, I've finally found a hibachi place! The one thing that I dislike about Harrisburg is the lack of restaurants. I gave this place a try and I was pleased! I had the combo teriyaki shrimp and chicken with broccoli and carrots. I also tried the shrimp tempura. I'm a snob when it comes to sushi. It was decent, but I think I will stick to the entrees."}
{"text":"This was my first time and the food is delicious. Great for quick take out of Asian food. Will definitely return and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered teriyaki chicken with broccoli. The fried rice that came with it was nothing special because the rice was lacking flavor and the peas were old. The chicken was fresh, but the sauce gave me a sesame chicken vibe instead. They skimped on the broccoli. The portion size was very small compared to other hibachi places. Overall the value is too poor for me to come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite for takeout! Somehow affordable and delicious. I always get the hibachi meals. Comes with vegetables and rice and yum yum sauce, so really the whole Japanese experience to go"}
{"text":"This restaurant was bought out from the previous owners about a year ago. The environment is much nicer now, the staff is very friendly and your food never takes more than 5-10 minutes even in peak hours. Great, SMALL place to have quick Japanese in the Burg."}
{"text":"Finally found a Japanese Express that serves hibachi tofu, and it was delicious! Definitely recommend eating at Ichi!"}
