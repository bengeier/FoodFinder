{"text":"I'm short on time, but this place deserves a review. Simply, great food and great service. Cute well done decor. Whoever reads this...you will really like this great little family owned and run restaurant! It was my first time here but not my last."}
{"text":"I ate here a week ago the tacos in my opinion where less than satisfactory.  I had 3 carna asda tacos the carna tasted a few days old nasty although the other ingredients tasted fresh.  I also had a fish taco it was okay and tasted better with their yellow corn tortillas which didn't go well with the carna. 

The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant decor was okay aswell

Overall I give them three stars this place seems like a white wash rendition of Mexican food little authenticity in my opinion although they had a Chicana in the kitchen"}
{"text":"I finally decided to stop by Gordas yesterday after driving past it for almost two years now.. I'm so glad that I stopped in and grabbed some tacos! The customer service was awesome. Very friendly and helpful staff. They recommended that I tried anything with adobada, and I'm glad I chose that. I ordered two adobada tacos with rice and beans. The tacos are a little smaller, but they load them up with meat and pico de gallo. Next time I will order three tacos or maybe try one of their burritos. They also have a clean salsa bar there which was stocked with good tasting salsa and toppings such as cilantro and onions. If you are thinking about going to Gordas, do yourself a favor and get off the computer and go now. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was excellent.  I love going to mom and pop places over the large chains.   I would just recommend to increase the font size of the menu."}
{"text":"Gorda's is a great taco place that empasizes on \"baja.\" All the ingredients are always so fresh. They have a new soda machine with a lot of drink choices which is always good living in phoenix. The people who work there are good hardworking people and it's great to see them do what they are truly passionate about which is serving outstanding food with a well balance of their always fresh ingredients. Don't hesitate get down to Gorda's baja tacos and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is very flavorful. Had the fish tacos w/ Chipotle mayo highly recommend to all you fish taco lovers."}
{"text":"Great carne asada tacos but the fish tacos are even better! Large tacos and portions for the price."}
{"text":"gracias x la atencion.. y solucionar el.mal.entendido.. habla de un buen negocio.. y comprensible due√±o ;)"}
{"text":"Anything on there menu that I have ordered is always made the way you want it and it's so damn good! I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was so amazing, I had literally got up, walked to the window and told the cook that it was delicious! I had a order of 2 adobada tacos and a drink of dr.pepper, I love how the soda machine wasn't behind the counter (free refills) I loved that they had a fully stocked salsa's, lemons, spicy carrots.

I found that it was shocking the place wasn't as busy as it should be. I felt like if the word got more spread around about this restaurant, they would be swamped! Maybe I just came @ a dead hour, who knows. This was my first time and definitely not my last!

Besides the food...The woman working the register has a beautiful smile :)"}
{"text":"Fish Taco Tuesday. That's says it all. Plenty of other fine choices if fish isn't your thing. The salsa bar is just the right size. The vegetable mix is excellent. The staff is terrific."}
{"text":"It's okay. But I wish they used homemade beans,  I'm Mexican and don't like Rosarita beans . Sorry but the Carne asada burrito just doesn't take good with all the stuff you put in it. It needs to be renamed to; Rice with  canned beans,pico  and some carne.......asada? Not sure,  the  chicken wrap was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get food to go. We tried the carnitas fries and I had the salad bowl and my husband had a burrito. The meat was excellent!! Full of flavor, which is hard to find these days. Only negative,  I thought the fries were soggy and full of grease, but my husband loved them and he really enjoyed the burrito. Enough food for 2 meals!!"}
{"text":"The Baja Tacos are definitely amazing; but what puts this place head and shoulders above all the Mexican joints in the area is the Carne Asada! 

I'm telling you-- you've never had REAL steak at an affordable (prices are great, too!) Mexican place before! My first time I had the tacos-- and they were surprisingly good, but my next time I had a burrito and the first thing I tasted was a mouth full of REAL marinated steak! And super tender, too.

I'm soooo happy I found this place, as I judge most Mexican eateries by their burritos and carne asada-- and this place is absolutely the best!!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos were better than most.  I will ask for them cooked a bit longer next time. But that's just my preference."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the tacos, but I say try the Torta's (Mexican sandwiches)!    This is our favorite little go-to local Mexican food establishment - way better than any of the other's around Laveen."}
{"text":"I showed up at 8:50 PM and they said they decided to close early tonight. Not ok to just close when you feel like it!!"}
{"text":"Gordas Baja Taco is simply sensational. Do yourself a favor by keeping things simple and picking out a few tacos to try. That's what I did when I moved into the area and I've been coming back ever since, sometimes multiple visits a week, don't judge me please.  

The tacos remind me of the best tacos available anywhere, the ones you can only get on the streets of TJ. Barring a lengthy drive to get those, you should check these out. All of the old standby favorites are there but my highest rated are the adobada, carnitas, and the asada. They recently added some seafood options as well but I haven't had enough time to adequately try them all so I can't review those. 

The other great thing about this place is that they have a salsa bar (green, red, and hot) so you can fix'em up however you like. I'm pretty sure it is family owned and operated and everyone who works there is extremely nice. If you are anywhere on the west side it is worth stopping by here to try. I've even driven here from Tempe on my lunch break, that's how good these tacos are. 

I'm torn because I want them to get more business but I also don't want to wait in long lines if more people figure out this place exists...."}
{"text":"They have made some changes but, their shrimp tacos are still my favorite. Prices are a little higher but, service is still great."}
{"text":"Didn't turn out as I thought. The reviews here are good but it didn't hold true to us. I'm from California and we have some bomb ass tacos. So me and some of my friends went to this place in Phoenix, Arizona and boy their tacos were BLAND, the rice and beans were cold. And for what we paid, I expected better. We wanted to refund our food but of course we didn't.  

Our group ordered the 2 adobada tacos with rice and beans (that's mine), 4 spicy shrimp tacos, a Baja bowl, and the 2 battered something tacos with rice and bean.

I like Mexican food and I know when it's good and when it's not and what I had at this place was not good at all, no flavor. I also ate one of those spicy taco shrimp and it was soggy. 

To top it off, my friends all agreed the food were flavorless.

So no more tacos for us until we get back home."}
{"text":"Tuesday is the day for the fish taco special (2 for $3). Yum! Everything was great - the fish was fresh cooked and hot, the salsas were fresh made, and there are windows where you can your order being made. Tried a bite of the fish without the sauce, cabbage, etc. It was cooked well and flavorful on its own. I would order it for a meal if it was offered, but that is why the tacos are so good.  Clean restaurant, good flavor, and I will go back.
Also, they have Hire's Root Beer (bonus points)."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas on business in Phoenix. I had the grilled fish tacos they were delicious. Fresh with good flavor. I would recommend them to others. They even have a salsa bar. The only thing is their POS system is outdated, it would help to have a better description on receipts for expense purposes."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day for dinner. The staff was nice and friendly.  The fish burritos were quite large and filling. Lots of good flavor.  We really liked the fish tacos as well. Good portions and quite flavorful.  The little salsa bar is a bonus. 

 The only minus was that the corn tortillas were really bland - tasted like cardboard.    It doesn't do it justice to put all that delicious fish and fresh ingredients on a very low quality tortilla.  Next time I go I hope they upgrade the tortilla - then I'll give it more stars!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I try to go once a week.  I'm not sure why this place has gotten such bad reviews. I think it's some of the best Mexican food in the are at the best price, and the seasoning on the chicken tacos/burritos always keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good. It's such a convenient location i would've loved to have a great taco spot in this area but unfortunately this place was barely okay. I'm skipping this place, I can make tastier tacos at home with no effort."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night and order take out. The tacos were so delicious! After reading the reviews I decided to try the Fish and Carne Asada tacos. Then I asked the girl at the register to suggest a third so I ordered the Adobado. All three were delicious but I ordered WAY too much food. I think on a normal night 1 1/2 would be plenty. I couldn't eat it all. My favorite was the Fish Taco, and the Carne Asada Taco was a very close second. I didn't try the rice, beans, or chips. The salsa bar is clean. The bar was out of one salsa I wanted to try so I asked for more and they happily (and quickly) brought out another batch. The salsas were all cold and tasted fresh. The people there are so friendly. I would definitely recommend Gordas Baja Taco :)"}
{"text":"What a gem! They have the best fish tacos I've ever had. They worker with me to find something I can eat with my many food allergies. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos, enough said!  Try them, they're some of the best I've ever had. The food is so fresh, the fish so flaky, the salsas so tasty. Thank you for having such a great place to go to in Laveen!"}
{"text":"We got tacos here and they were legit...street tacos meat and pico...tacos adobada are very tasty."}
{"text":"I live in the SoMo area and I remember waiting (patiently) for Gorda's Baja Taco to open.  Well, it's been a few year since it opened and it's been worth the wait.  I absolutely love Gorda's.  First of all, the staff is incredible.  I feel like Gorda's is my Cheers...they always greet me by name and sometimes start making my order before I even get all the way to the register.  

Now, on to the food.  Everything I've had is great.  I can be a picky eater; however, I know that whatever I get taste fresh and homemade.  these recipes are not downloaded from the internet!
  
Must haves: Carne Asada Burrito is my favorite.  the meat is fresh, tender and peppery.  something to note: the burrito's here are HUGE! you could split one between two people.  Pork adobada tacos are amazing.  they are in the vein of street tacos and they are delicious.  The carne asada fries are also amazing, but you might want to share them!

Gorda's has a great salsa bar that has three different types of salsa, onions, cilantro and carrots/cucumbers.  The salsa is top-notch and you get to use as much as you want.  

I have taken friends, co-workers and family to Gorda and everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos!! 
Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch and it was quiet. Ordered 3 fish tacos that were the best! So fresh and the chipotle sauce you can add was just right. 
Staff was very kind and let me know that Tuesday they have a special with 2 fish tacos, beans and rice for less than $7! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on July 18 for the fish taco Tuesday special. Stephanie told us they were excellent and we would not regret it. She was correct the ingredients were fresh and our food was served really fast. We did the three fish tacos with rice and beans. Now I'm ready for a nap. I will be back many times the restaurant is clean the people are friendly"}
{"text":"My coworker and I wanted to try this place out for Taco Tuesday. I had the fish tacos and she had the carne asada tacos. We both agreed the tacos were delicious! The place was clean, service was fast! The only downside of the meal was the rice. Our rice was hard as if it was reheated from the night before or left out too long. I'll go back to try it again."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest just like I will do with any review,

I'll start if with the service, it was excellent. They were attentive and very very nice and polite, granted I was only there to order something to go but they were still overly nice. The place is super clean and I think anyone can appreciate a clean restaurant. The salsa bar was clean and the salsas were very tasty I took one of each because I'm a salsa fan but no guacamole at salsa bar, no bueno. 
I'm from Mexico born and raised on \"real\" Mexican food, which is where my problem started. I think the \"three starts\" I'm giving could have been because I ordered the wrong things based on my taste. I ordered the \"Gordas Wipe out\" which is a burrito made enchilada style. If you are Mexican than you know that huge burritos aren't really Mexican and that enchilada style is really not a Mexican thing so on my part that was a mistake for ordering that.  The burrito was good I'm not going to say it was bad or anything it was good and it was huge! I didn't finish it and I was stuffed. The problem was that my clumsy self didn't really read the menu right and it could have been because the overly nice person at the register wouldn't stop recommending me things and I'd rather listen to them than read the menu. My passion is pastor/adovada, but like another person in a new restaurant I wanted to taste everything. The person at the register kept insisting on the wipe out stating it has a little bit of everything and so when I heard everything I imagined adovada asada and chicken, I don't know why that came to my head, maybe cause I had just gotten done explaining how much I love adovada/pastor. Well I get my food and come to work to eat the nice huge burrito. I have no clue what the guy meant by \"a little bit of everything\" because it only had rice beans shredded beef and sour cream.  I guess I was still stuck and getting three meats that I was disappointed like I said it could have been my fault.

The prices are also a bit high. Being that I work in the area I can proudly say that I have been to almost every restaurant and food truck in this area and this has by far been the one with the highest prices, I paid around 7.50 for the burrito but once again it was big. Yes I get it, it's not a food truck so It doesn't have food truck prices but in this area tacos for over 1.50 are pricy specially Baja tacos because they are small, I think here they are over 2 bucks. Now they have great reviews so it might have just been me and what I ordered and my mistakes. Although I think it's a bit pricy for the area I will give it a second chance because of the friendly service and the cleanliness of the place and also because I love to support locally owned businesses. 

I promise that when I go the second time and it blows me away like it did most of the people who are writting reviews on here I will change this review and update with a new one."}
{"text":"I had to come see if this place lives up to the hype!  I ordered two fish tacos and one carne asada taco.  The carne asada was stellar, some of the best I've ever had.  While I consider the fish tacos above average, they didn't set the world on fire with me!  The star deduction is for too much cabbage on the tacos and using Corn tortillas that were obviously pulled out of the freezer this morning!  Fresh Corn Tortillas made the same day are the foundation of a good taco...Please think about that Gorda's if you read this, you know I'm right!  I'll certainly be back because it was quite good, but know if could certainly be a touch better!"}
{"text":"Really good food, not very busy. The fish tacos are worth the trip. Two tacos is perfect, 3 will leave you stuffed. Figure $3.25/taco. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's a nice hidden gem in Laveen! We were trying to look for a delicious Mexican joint for lunch and saw this place had one of the best reviews. Glad we found it! I had the chicken naked burrito and it was so delicious! Fantastic flavor in the chicken and you could tell that all the vegetables were fresh. My boyfriend got the carne asada fries and wowsa! So much flavor and so much food! Great portions on both entrees and amazing flavor. I also liked the salsa bar they had out for customers. Also, great customer service and kept everything clean. They even checked up on us to see how the food was. They also greeted people coming in and out of the restaurant. Definitely 5 stars all around! Great food and great service."}
{"text":"There's not much in the way of good, non-chain restaurants to choose from in Laveen, so thank heavens for Gorda's Baja Tacos. They have great, fresh, authentic Mexican food! The fish tacos in particular are amazing, and the salsas are also impressive. And to top it off, the owners and staff are very friendly, helpful and attentive.  Finally a great restaurant in Laveen!"}
{"text":"SERVICE- with a smile. Good upsell on rice and beans with tacos. She was knowledgeable about menu. Directed me to salsa bar in back. While cleaning front, she came by to see how I was doing and how food was. Very friendly. Nice for such a small place.
CLEANLINESS -Place was alittle dirty around salsa bar area for only having 2 other people inside.
SALSA BAR - looked fresh and full.
FOOD - ordered Carne Asada and Carnitas tacos. Presentation was appetizing. Both meats tasted exactly the same. They heated meat in the same oil, which tasted like fryer oil. Heavy Oil dripped everywhere which was not appetizing. Grissle and very chewey carne asada made it disappointing. Some of the Carnitas wete soft, but other pieces were dried out.  Feel bad because I really wanted some good Mexican food. My gut was thinking Ceviche, should have gone with that, maybe next time."}
{"text":"The undisputed taco champion of Laveen! They take such great care in the preparation and presentation of their food and it always tastes fresh.

I've tried something different on their menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some fresh tacos so decided to try Gordas out. It was my first experience. Very good but would like to get more bang for my buck. I would definitely go back and try something new from, but they seriously need to think about super sizeing their tacos.  Was to small for the price you will pay."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot for fish tacos! I've dined in and ordered for pick up. Both are easy and fast. They're always friendly and the place is clean. Can't ever go wrong with a small restaurant with 5 star service. Also did I mention that the fish tacos are amazing?!"}
{"text":"We went to Gordas last week and wow... we were really happy with our meal.  We wanted to try lots of different things, so we shared the Chile Verde Sopes (Amazing), the Crispy Beef taco, the Carnitas taco, the Adobada taco, the Carne Asada taco, the Carne Asada Fries, and a Quesadilla!  Without exception, everything we tried was fantastic.  They also have these little spicy carrots at the salsa bar.  Yum.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I'm completely satisfied.... Best fish tacos, i had to get three and it was a lot for me. They're very filling and i love their open salsa bar, their service, and it's nice and clean. The only thing I hate is that they're so so far from me so whenever I'm in the area i have to stop by and get some bomb ass tacos : ) .....  love love love this place! Just make sure you ask for the chipotle sauce for fish tacos, it's a must have.... trust me. I got home and I was dancing and singing lol, yup it's them tacos that got me going... even my bf was like what's wrong with you and when I told him he laughed bc I've been on a strict diet and i do get a little moody sometimes : ).... anyway, i probably won't be back to this place for a while bc of my diet, maybe when I lose another 12 pounds I'll be back : ) lol"}
{"text":"We went for the first time last week and the food was fabulous! There were 10 of us and we ordered ceviche (fish and shrimp mixed), veggie quesadilla, carne asada burrito with enchilada sauce, carne asada fries, shrimp tacos, and fish tacos. Everything was delicious. My favorite was the ceviche and the fish tacos. The owner and his daughters were very attentive and nice. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Had the Adobada and Shrimp tacos..both were DELISH!...and the people working there are very nice."}
{"text":"I had the fish and shrimp tacos and my wife had the carne asada tacos, both were equally awesome! We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. My first visit, I had a carne asada burrito. It was fresh and big, it was delicious. The girl at the counter was very pleasant. Their salsa bar is fully stocked. Definetly better than any *Bertos..."}
{"text":"Got the sopes and craved them again the next day. Staff friendly, place clean, food amazing! My husband also enjoyed his food."}
{"text":"Chips are freshly made, as is the guacamole! Delicious! 
We are here for Taco Tuesday, 2 fish tacos, rice, beans and a drink for $6.69! This is an amazing deal! Thy are delicious! My 7 year old son gets the fish burrito he is addicted! He asks for it all the time! Delicious food, friendly service, we love this place!"}
{"text":"My update is a sad update to a review I just posted not that long ago and has always been a five! But literally, my husband who frequent Gordas when we crave fresh fish tacos were SO let down and then the follow up call when we got home and realized that an item we added to our order was missing , I had to update. After a quick hike, we were craving Gordas usual greatness... we made the trek over and noticed the 'Gordas Baja' was dark and only 'Taco' was lit up outside .. not a big deal , but from the street , if you didn't know and were 'new' to Gordas .. well. ?? It was dark out. Enough said. We enter. Neither my husband or I have ever loved the tall menu on the wall .. it's slanted and a bit hard to read. This night, Nothing, Nada, Zilch is on the menu. The girl working asks us if it's our first time and we respond with a ,'No'. I ask her what is going on with the menu ? She said its being replaced. Okay no biggie again, but AGAIN, if someone is new to Gordas.. mention it at first , maybe ?? Don't just stare at them and assume! We grab the paper take out menus and scroll. There's a handwritten, hard to read in cursive 'reminder' under these take out menus that say 'Eating undercooked, raw fish, poultry etc.......' ( You know the one!) Yeah. It's usually printed on a menu! Why is that handwritten in cursive here ? I don't remember that. 
We order the Gerbanator , a small, a little pricier than other Gordas dishes, but good and fresh shrimp taco that's made with peppers and just enough cheese and onion and the cheese enchiladas. We love Gordas fresh salsa bar located in the back and head there to load our bag to take home. My husband and I noticed the hot water heater is leaking ALOT!! It's exposed so it's able to be seen. It's one thing after another tonight that is broken and it's disappointing. Then I remember I wanted a diet soda , not a usual thing for me , but when I have tacos IF I can't have tequila , well.. this is my trade off. I go back to order a soda. I wait a few minutes and finally say to the girl who's in the back , 'Hi! Sorry, can I order a diet soda?' She then informs me that NOW the soda machine is out of order. But they have bottles of soda. Not the plastic ones , ( BPA and all un-green and unhealthy , I know ! ), or cans even , old school bottles of regular sodas. Oh my gosh. Just not our night for a favorite place! I order some chips; she says she will place them with our order; my mistake is telling her I didn't need a receipt when I asked, as I would need that later when I called BECAUSE, GO FIGURE, she didn't add them and when we got home with our order that she brought to us while we waited , FIRST time out, one thing was missing ; so she returned to the kitchen giggling to herself and mumbling something ; then no bag and she returned again mumbling and giggling , 'Oh my God , TO GO!' , she giggles. Now we get home and...!!! NO chips. I was so irritated that I hesitated, but I called. NOT that I was gonna drive back, but I wanted to let her know. How many times on Yelp does someone say , 'Did you let the manager know ?' After I've not let managers know in the past sometimes thinking I was making a mountain of a mole hill, I'm trying this year.. and I do it nicely:) It's just chips and possibly an honest mistake so when I called , I spoke with the girl who waited on us ; that I've seen her there several times ;this time the owner was not there. To add more frustration , she acted like she didn't know who I was or what the scenario was. I was
there just 5 minutes ago, I explained!! Now that's when I got more agitated because NO one was in Gordas .. only two men who left shortly after we ordered. She had to have known because I explained my order , gave the story of the machine being broke , my original receipt number. So she denied it. I hung up. Let it go. It's two bucks and some change. 
Our food was not as good as before either. Everything seemed 'runny'. My shrimp taco tasted anything but fresh and I was a tad afraid to eat it. I tossed it. The shrimp were smaller than I remember. Fail is when you deny when a customer let you know of a problem and also when may very well lose frequent customers with giggling rudeness and lack of concern. Get your act together now. Put some effort back into this place that has major potential! It's  sad what I witnessed the other night on many levels. :-("}
{"text":"I was craving fish tacos so I did a Yelp search and came across this place. I stopped in to try it out and got 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the fish and and shrimp tacos were and big too. Always a plus. The sauce they put in them is very tasty. The tortilla was just ok for me seemed thicker than normal corn tortillas. I'm not a huge corn tortilla fan. I prefer flour but it worked with the tacos. I would recommend giving the place a try and I would return myself for more fish tacos when the craving hits."}
{"text":"I just want to say that this place is amazing! Not only is the service great but the food is phenominal. I would recommend the fish taco combo on their taco tuesdays!!! The spicy shrimp tacos are great too! My husband and I just recently moved to AZ and wanted to try it. We are now die hard fans and are going to be coming here for a long time!!"}
{"text":"I've lived a mile away from Gordas for a few years now and for some reason have never stopped by here, despite wanting to. I finally stopped in for lunch today and was very pleased with the Surf and Turf burro. After reading other reviews I plan to go back very soon and get some fish tacos and some chimi's.
The place was very clean. The young lady behind the counter was very friendly and our food was ready very quickly."}
{"text":"Food was great! Shrimp & Fish tacos are Bomb! Salsa is good! And staff is friendly! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"BEST FISH TACOS!!!! We ordered fish tacos with rice and beans and a side of chips. The fish tacos were some of the best I've ever had. Their chips they fry as you order them. That completely amazed me. The chips were perfectly crispy. The staff was very nice and attentive. I always look in the kitchen if I can and it was spotless. This is my new favorite place!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the surf and turf burrito and I'm a fan!! I will be returning! Good carne asada nachos too!"}
{"text":"Our family has been visiting this place for a few years.  Although expensive the food was always fresh and the service WAS exceptional.  Now it is just another narrow minded taco shop that serves their menu only to their liking and not to their customer's liking.  According to the cashier the owner's now do not make changes.  Sounds like a disaster is happening, and possibly some infighting from co-owners.  And we all know what that means, it reflects in the taste of their food.  PS--the menu has now changed as well.........and not for the good.

Baja's- welcome to the BEGINNING OF YOUR END OF YOUR BUSINESS.

I know after today's experience we will never be back.  I cannot wait to see what business is going to occupy the place where you once existed."}
{"text":"I've heard of monstrous two handed burritos before but never two handed tacos!! I had a problem the other day. A huge appetite and a pocketful of laundry money and pocket lint. I ended up scoring two tacos for under six bucks. These weren't your average pocket tacos w a sprinkle of carne and a sprizzle of onion in a palm sized flat cake. These were perfectly cooked swine with fresh cabbage onions and tomatoes in a canopy of maiz. They were a bit naked so I stopped by the salsa bar to shower em w limon before tapping them with different salsas to really make em dance. Had I checked the menu or had been there before  I would have gone with the 5 rolled tacos aka taquitos for under $4. If they took that much care into the lower priced items I can't wait to return to see what else they have  up their sleeve. Try to find more bang for your buck in the south side let alone az and you will b disappointed."}
{"text":"I retract my past review ....very very tasty and delicious! 5 stars! I had a chicken burrito chimi style, and 2 carne asada tacos, both fantastically seasoned! I will be a return customer for sure! 

The staff is very friendly and they take a personal interest in their customers. The girl at the front counter remembered me from my last visit, even though it was some time ago. Another customer came in while I was deciding on what I wanted to get, and she remembered that customer as well! A+ service and quality!

Good place to go for lunch or dinner, rather you just want a nice place to sit and eat, or you are in a hurry and want something fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Gordas' fish tacos are on par with Wahoos in SoCal and The Hula Grill in Waikiki.
If you want to taste one of the best fish tacos in all of Phoenix Metro, pack-up the kids, dog and grandma and head for Gordas.

Gordas delights on so many levels, I have to give it my highest Diego rating in the history of e.v.e.r. They're just that good.

On a personal note, I'd like to encourage anyone reading this to try Gordas at least once. Mainly because I know you'll be hooked on them like I was, increasing the likelihood Gordas will grow and flourish and I get to continue to enjoy the place.

The restaurant business is tough, with it's 95% failure rate.
To let a restaurant like Gordas succumb to these sobering stats due to a lack of customers would be an outright travesty. Especially when they're this good.
In short, I hope Gordas becomes the Wahoos of Phoenix, they deserve it.

If you want a taco, forget Jack-in-the-box, or any 'mexican' joint claiming a 'berto' in its suffix, there's really only one place to go.
Gordas.

PS
By the way, your wife can come with you, grandma and the dog too, but only on the condition that she take a big healthy whiff of the fish taco before eating it. 
Maybe then she'll finally appreciate what you've gone through all these years."}
{"text":"You Could Do Worse

We found Gordas Tacos Baja via a quick Yelp Search.   Gordas was the closest place that we could all agree on.  Gordaas is really just a fast food Mexican joint.  Certainly better than a Taco Bell, but not even close to the quality of most Mexican Restaurants . 

The menu is posted high on the wall and is a little challenging to read.  The seating in the restaurant is packed, so it is difficult to negotiate around the tables.  

The food was average or a little better, but the portions are are very filling.  I would go back, but I would certainly investigate other options first."}
{"text":"It's a proximate lunch spot for me, and I admit, that has something to do with why I like it so much.  But beyond that, they serve some really incredible fish tacos.  Also, they are super nice folks."}
{"text":"Really great tacos, highly enjoyable experience...recommend this place for something different."}
{"text":"We go here a lot, and usually have an assortment of mini tacos.  We love them all.  Very friendly staff, great prices, quick service.  Our favorite mini tacos are the fish and the adobada. YUM!"}
{"text":"Good food! Very clean! Great service! Not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and it was super delish. My 6 yr old son got a fish taco and surf n turf, he did not leave a trace behind! The staff are super friendly and call you by name. They conversate with you amd ensure ur visit was enjoyable. I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few items from their menu like the fish tacos, Carne asada tacos and their chorizo burrito. I was pretty dissapointed each time in the flavors. everything is fresh but it just isn't very good in my opinion. my dad loves the tacos here though and I do admit the salsa is great but there just isn't anything that would make me go back here."}
{"text":"Being the whimsical guy i am, i decided to go for it with Gordas. I saw on Yelp that it had lots of positive reviews and there wasn't anything else nearby but fast food. The place was somewhere between Filibertos and Chipotle but in all the right ways. Fresh salsa bar was fresh! RC cola in the fountain: something you dont see often, but nice. I had the surf and turf burrito. It was huge like Chipotle, but tasted way better. It reminded me what Mexican food is supposed to taste like (meaning not some combo of trendy flavors like chipotle). It had shrimp, steak, mexican rice and perfectly zippy and fresh-tasting pico de gallo. The staff were really friendly and the food came out fast. Great lunch spot if youre in this area."}
{"text":"Food is very good and very fresh I ordered a fish taco and a shrimp taco. My husband ordered the chicken asada burrito and was very good as well"}
{"text":"Okay, my friend and I were looking for a place to eat lunch. We read the reviews claiming this place has the best tacos in laveen. 
Our first clue should have been that we are the only ones inside on a friday at lunch. I had carne asada tacos and friend had shrimp. 
I have to say I take a joke pretty good. I thought about posting a great review, kicking back and laughing at the poor guy who enters after us. I can in good conscience do that to another human.
After being over charged by a buck our food came out. My first bite and I thought I was eating road kill from out on baseline road. Wow I will need to gargle with acid to rid my poor taste buds of this flavor. 
The shrimp were covered in a dough, next time hide the shrimp better, we managed to find them in the dough this time. The flavor was bland.
Hey the soda fountain worked well and produced good flavor!"}
{"text":"FISH TACOS! FISH TACOS! FISH! TACOS! Lol
Came today to try them as recommended by my husband and OH. MY. GAWD! To die for! So delicious! Very flavorful! I loved them! The lady working the counter (1 of the owners possibly?) was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. The cook even came from the back to greet us as well. She asked in the middle of the meal if we needed anything and how everything was tasting. Great food. Great customer service. A little pricey but man those tacos were so worth it. And they even have churros!"}
{"text":"Gorda's Baja taco has a friendly staff, but the food isn't that great.  I've been here a couple times and each time I wasn't satisfied with their food.  On one occasion I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito that was about 90% french fries, 5% egg, and 5% bacon."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. It was clean and the staff was very nice.the portions were plenty and its kid friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good fish tacos! My husband is a taco snob. He thinks that having been born in Mexicali, he was granted with an innate ability to accurately judge any taco on authenticity, taste, and grandeur.  He loves, loves this place! My only wish is that they served the tacos with that yummy chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"I like the pescatarian and vegetarian options! I wish the salsa containers were bigger."}
{"text":"Best damn fish tacos I've ever had!!! You don't know what you're missing if you haven't tried these. Everything else I've had has been great but excellent fish tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly spot in south phoenix that I will most likely visit again. I wanted so bad to give four stars but will most likely review again on my second visit. The soda I wanted was out in the machine and the surf and turf burro was supposed to have chipotle shrimp and it seemed like it was missing sauce or seasoning on it. Everything else I saw there looked very good and I wish I had more time on my original visit to study the menu to order the wipeout burro which looks fantastic and has a yelp deal. The counter staff and cooks are all very friendly and well kept and you can tell they are trying their best to put a good light on their establishment. The salsa was fresh and tasted very good. The burrito was a good portion and filled me up for the rest of the day. The crane Asada and Quac tasted great. Overall I would recommend this place to those looking for a good bite where good restaurants are hard to find area wise."}
{"text":"Was alright - nothing special... Chicken taco was blah, fish taco was eh, steak taco was good."}
{"text":"We have lived in the Laveen area for a while, and today was the first time we tried Gordas.  Wow!  The fish tacos that I had were delicious.  We will definitely be back....who knows, it might be tomorrow.  It might be dangerous having this restaurant so close to our house."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day with two friends who were driving cross-country and just had to try the fish tacos.  We were the only folks in the place at 6:00 on a Friday which I thought was strange, especially given the popularity of the restaurant on Yelp!  Oh well, more tacos for me!
The girl working the counter was patient and answered our questions about the menu.  Two of us decided on the fish tacos (of course), and the third chose a bean and cheese burrito. All three dinners (included rice and beans and one soft drink came to roughly $22.
They have a very clean, well stocked salsa bar complete with spicy pickled carrots (yum), cilantro, and onions.  We filled up our little salsa cups and anxiously awaited our food.
About 10 minutes later we had our food.  The tacos were huge (so was the burrito) and the tacos were stuffed with cabbage and cilantro.  I was a little bit disappointed to find the fish to be tasteless, though light, fluffy, and perfectly fried.  I simply poured some salsa on it and it improved the taste ten-fold.  
I'd really like to go back and try their ceviche and a couple of other things on the menu.  I wasn't blown away by the taco but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thanks, a-holes, who gave this place 5 stars.

I just drove out to the sticks and wasted $14.00 for one of the worst burritos I have ever had (took one bite and gave it away), greasy, unsalted cheese fries, and bland, watered-down horchata.

I can sum up Gordas Baja Taco in three words:

Awful, awful, awful.

This restaurant is actually worse than Taco Bell.

I cut the burrito in half and it fell apart, because it only consisted of dry rice and undercooked pink chicken.

I am forcing myself to eat these disgusting French fries, because I am hungry and didn't feel like getting food poisoning from the gross burrito they gave me.  The only thing I have to wash the horrible taste out of my mouth is their water-horchata.  Blech.

This must be what they serve people in Hell.

If you are smart and actually like GOOD food, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"LOVE Gorda's Baja Taco! 

Not a chain and you can tell the owners take pride in the restaurant they have created and the food they make. All of the food was fresh (but be ready to wait a little longer for it to be made, partially because it is so fresh & partially because there's only one person in the kitchen), and the salsa bar was clean and stocked. 

This restaurant is small and sits on the end of a strip mall in south Phoenix. There is plenty of parking, including directly in front. Owners say they are working on putting a patio in front and will serve Mexican & domestic beers soon. 

I have tried the carne asada breakfast burrito (amazing), the Surf & Turf burrito (carne asada & shrimp- it's really amazing) and the grilled veggie quesadilla. I would highly recommend all and can't wait to go back and try more from the menu! The spicy carrots at the salsa bar are better than I've ever had. Just enough spice, and they are crisp, fresh carrots.

Things I didn't like about Gorda's:
- the menu on the wall has small print & is difficult to read
- they serve RC soda. Maybe I'm a snob, but that doesn't taste good to me. Wish they had Diet Coke! 
- no nachos. 

Gorda's takes cards & cash. If you find yourself in the area, try out this new, independent restaurant- it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  So delicious, and surprisingly inexpensive.  Excellent customer service, and very clean and well-maintained."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I don't come here enough, the food is amazing, service is great and the establishment clean"}
{"text":"Excellent food..great service. Definitely coming back. The burrito was huge and very good. The food was fresh."}
{"text":"Cool California-style Mexican place

If all you're looking for are fish tacos, you can't go wrong. Theirs are large and flavorful, without the pitfall of being too greasy. 

I tried their adobada fries, and it was too sweet for me, not that there was more than a smidgen of meat anyway. Wouldn't get it again.

It's OK, but basically a poor man's Rubio's/Baja Fresh"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh tasting food FULL of flavor! Affordable prices!"}
{"text":"First time visiting, we will be back. Really liked the grilled fish tacos."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and ceviche. Chips were hot and fresh. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but the fish tacos were as good as I have had. I thought they were a bit pricey but not too bad. The people working there were really nice to me and introduced themselves and told me about the owner. I will definitely go back there"}
{"text":"First time with 3 co-workers during lunch. Good food, quiet and cozy atmosphere... we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos great! The ceviche horrible tasted as if the shrimp was old and had been sitting a while."}
{"text":"Very good food and great friendly service! Very clean building I highly recommend this place food always taste fresh!! Surf and turf burrito is bomb"}
{"text":"My experience here was ok. It's a clean and nice place to eat. But the food is nothing extraordinary. I wouldn't come back even for the deals. Wasn't worth trying in my opinion."}
{"text":"Okay so I was very excited to find a baja style \"fresh\" taco place in my neighborhood as I had every intention of becoming a regular customer.  On April 20, 2015 I had purchased a shrimp taco, carne asada taco, and a children's menu quesadilla with a side of rice and beans. Now everything and I mean EVERYTHING sadly, was kind of foul.  I took one bite of my shrimp taco and instantly I knew that it was rancid ):{  I pulled it out so I could take a sniff to confirm.  It looked so hideously disgusting as a slug ... Now how could you take something as beautiful as shrimp and mold it into a slug-ish worm looking thing? I wanted to throw up, but couldn't.

Then, the quesadilla was okay ... I mean really mediocre, but the fries were as wet and limp as spaghetti saturated in grease.  Clearly the oil had not been changed in days -- The fries were black!!!  Now how could I feed that to my child? 

Lastly, the beans must have been pureed because they ran about as runny as soup and I could not identify any beans there in. The rice was cold as if it were sitting in a fridge cooked from days before! I can't make this up o_0 I'm really not a mean person. I would never do that and I don't complain but today I have to because you could have killed me with that rancid shrimp taco!!! ; 0  So, yea thanks for not much. I would love to come back someday if the standards drastically change but right now I wouldn't be surprised if one day you file bankruptcy very soon for serving food like that to honest paying customers.  Two stars for the polite front desk service only."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food and a clean environment. I love the Taco Tuesday deal (2 Fish Tacos, Rice, Beans, and. Drink for under $7) and they put their burritos together the right way."}
{"text":"Great people and great food at a great price!

We recently relocated our business to this area and stop in here about 2x a week now. The girl at the counter is always super friendly. The food is always fresh and well made.

This is like Filibertos but much better IMO. Good stuff.

Try the Surf n Turf or the Adovada!"}
{"text":"The BEST tortas in the valley, hands down. My wife and I have tried them all over, including the popular spots, and this place has it down pat. In fact, everything we've tried hs been great. It's nice to have a local, family-owned spot that actually puts out a good product in this area!"}
{"text":"I followed the Yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! The food was hot and fresh, but the best part was the service. Valeria, who took my order was super friendly and informative since I was a first-timer. She also seemed to know everyone's name that came in, which means they have regulars. Burt, one of the cooks that I met, was also helpful when I was undecided and again extremely nice. 5 estrellas for being a super friendly local place. Thanks guys for a great first meal in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada burrito. Tortilla was cold with cold cheese inside little meat and a ton of rice. The burrito was tasteless will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Being new to the area we decided to give Gordas a try. The whole family was glad we did. I ordered a couple tacos one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were delicious. I especially enjoyed the carnitas but both were delicious. My husband and son both had burritos and after seeing them it left me wishing I had ordered one myself even if they were big (lunch for the next day). My daughter loved the enchilada plate that came with rice and beans. There were many different types of salsa in the salsa bar and the restaurant was clean and well decorated. I only wish we could have enjoyed our meal with a beer. We will definitely be back though the food was that good."}
{"text":"Just drove in from LA wanted some Mexican food, the carne asada was pretty good. I understand the fish tacos are popular, too. Might make a trip back before heading home. Family here hadn't heard of the place. All I can say is Yelp to the rescue!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.

Easy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on Taco Tuesday. The fish tacos were awesome. Definitely reminded me of tacos I ate in baja. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Had a three day class in South Phoenix and by the last day we were tired of the chain restaurants. We decided to try Gordas. I am so glad we did. Wish I would have found this place the first day I was there, I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else.  I'll be back (even if I have to make a special trip).  Great food!"}
{"text":"Their food is so good! I got 2 fish tacos with rice and beans. However, at $8 it was expensive for the portion they give you. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Second time I come here and both times I've had great food. There's closer Mexican restaurants by my house,  but the food here taste really good. 

I had there carne asada Sopes today and enjoyed every bite.  There shrimp cesadillas are great too!"}
