{"text":"Exploring the city, I found this noddle shop and decided to stop in and I was surprised. The Pork Belly Bowl that I got was fantastic. The Noodles were well cooked and didn't have that \"overcooked Udon\" taste to them, that I have experienced from other restaurants. (And you can subout Raman for Udon with any dish)  For Parking - you can park caddie corner across the street (Meter Parking - So bring your quarters) on behind the shopping center right across the street for free (Until 6)."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the pork belly. They don't have ice with your drink is one thing. The broth was delicious, not going to say it was bad. But what it deserve a 3 star was the pork belly. It was like eating jerky. I've had ramen pork belly else where and always remembered it melts in my mouth. I think if the pork belly was slow cooked, would get that nice moist soft taste."}
{"text":"This is the best noodle place in town for me, been living in Cleveland for 4 years. I make my own noodles at home daily because everyone that actually loves noodles should know the difference after you try this place.  The broth for a bowl of noodles is very important to me, and that Otani Noodle will never disappoint.  I've been there three times; ordered #1 #2 and #3.  The meal itself will make you full, $12 + $3 a bottle of drink is reasonable to me because I rather pay an extra few dollars for a great bowl of noodles than ($8-$10 a bowl elsewhere that I can cook at home myself anyway).  I will have to say service is fine for me, I consider this a noodle bar (not an actual restaurant where you seat and wait for a server).  Plus, the design/atmosphere is great, but I don't care too much about when I can actually eat the best noodles; Did I mention the broth, amazing!  Finally, my friend is a vegetarian and I believe #7 #8 #9 are for them.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"worst ramen I've ever had.  I've been to many ramen bars in los Angeles and this place is nothing like them. The only thing actually made there is hot water to steam the packaged noodles. very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just what I was looking for: yummy noodles, nicely seasoned, quick, delicious, and low cost. The restaurant is purely functional (long collective tables), but you come for the food. I had the pork belly which was perfect, tender and flavorful. I finally found my go-to noodle shop in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I don't like my experience with the boss at Otani Noodle. Their advertisement states that if we order their food through eat24 app, we will get a $2 discount. I asked the cashier about it, and the cashier turned to the boss. The boss thought we couldn't understand Chinese and yelled to the poor cashier saying that 'Of course no!! We can't give them the discount!!' This is not how you conduct business."}
{"text":"I don't frequent this type of food often, but this food is sooo good!! They should have this in the mall...people would eat this up!!"}
{"text":"So yummy. I went on one of the super freezing cold days over break and got the tonkotsu with pork belly on top. I never want to eat pork belly prepared any other way! Melt in your mouth, how it should be. Can't really say any Cleveland restaurants compare to restaurants in Japan, but this is the best ramen I've had in Cleveland. Takes me back to my Fukuoka days!!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered out from here, but it was hands down INCREDIBLE. I ordered the chicken katsu and it was delicious. The ramen was great too, the restaurant separated the noodles from the broth. That's how you know they know their stuff."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen.  The broth was not amazing like other places I've been to but the portion size was good and affordable.  It's a good cheap date."}
{"text":"This is the spot for flavorful ramen! Broth is so good and the pork belly is terrific! I want to eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen! After a huge disappointment at a noodle place in Crocker Park a few days ago, my wife, son, and I were still craving a more authentic ramen. We headed to Otami and the Case area for an outing. My sister in-law and her boyfriend also went with us. All were very satisfied. The dishes were complex, well presented, and extremely tasty. The brothes and noodles were awesome. Between the five of us we got three number 1s with pork, a seafood ramen, and a shrimp tempura ramen. My pork ramen was great. My wife's seafood ramen had a lighter and equally tasty broth and my son's shrimp tempura was crispy and flavorful. The place was cozy and dishes were served in a nice big bowl."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork belly ramen which is $12 and plus tips $15. However, I think it worth just $8......   There are ramens like noodle cat, which is just ok but the quantity is huge! There are real ramen that caused $12 or more, but they are real......   The ramen here is neither real or cheap......   Won't recommend......  BTW, if I expected to clean my own dish and no free water,  I expected not to pay any tips."}
{"text":"If Maruchan instant ramen is 1, any random ramen shop in Japan is 10, if Ippudo in NYC is 8, then noodle cat would be a 3, and this place would be a 5.  Noodles aren't quite right imho, they are soggy. Meat is too charred. Soup is ok but not great. At 12 bucks a bowl it's kind of pricey. It's very very loud inside because they are running two large fans, probably because they don't have strong enough AC.  Based purely on food, taking into account this is Cleveland and there aren't any great ramen options, I might give this 3.5 or even 4 stars, but overall I'd give it a 3. I'm happy it exists and I will probably come here semi-regularly."}
{"text":"Really good ramen, better than competitors in Cleveland across the street. Best and most authentic. If Daikaya in DC is a 10, Otani is a 9. Broth good to the last drop, not chicken soup. Pork belly properly cooked but still soft and chewy, not a cinder. Ramen fresh and succulent and not out of a box. Lots of fresh and authentic toppings including marinated egg, nori, and green onion. Staff friendly and efficient. Will go here again the next time I miss Japan."}
{"text":"Cute little place.. Although everything in there are overpriced especially all you getting is ramen!!. I don't understand why in the noodle soup the broth contain miso soup, yuck....  Probably won't be back any time soon"}
{"text":"Amazing torikatsu! Wonderful staff, amazing food! A small place, but a really good one to get some fantastic food! Definitely worth getting a bit lost on the way."}
{"text":"I came in during lunch time on a weekday.  It was quite crowded and the seating is limited to four tables and a wall counter.  I ordered a chicken tonkatsu with ramen noodles.  It was brought to my table in about five minutes.  The broth was flavorful with maybe a little too much msg.  The chicken was small, about the size of McDonald's chicken cutlet, and the breading was crunchy. Overall the soup was very good but pricy at $10.95."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! So fast, good prices, nice staff!! And love the food!! The spicy oil you can add that is on the tables is a great add on if you like it hot!!! I love the fried shrimp!"}
{"text":"Finally...some good noodle in town... Tonkatsu broth is absolutely delicious..... Perfectly cooked noodle... Definitely worth going back everyday..."}
{"text":"Had the tom yum gong. It was mostly noodles even though I ordered extra shrimp. The flavor was okay"}
{"text":"We had a even mix of ramen newbies and ramen lovers. Everyone raved about their meals. The broth was perfect, as was the pork belly."}
{"text":"Fast service and generous portions. My wife was afraid to try but ended up loving it. Try the Tom Yung Gong with hot and sour and you won't be disappointed. Free parking across the street."}
{"text":"My resolution is to Yelp more this year. I rely so heavily on Yelp to make my restaurant choices, its only right to reciprocate.   So here we go....I ate here for the first time last week and this is legit ramen! I had the pork belly ramen and the broth is delicious and flavorful.  The pork was well marinated and flavorful as well. There really isn't anything bad to say about the soup. I guess there was a bit more corn than I'd prefer but that's just being nit picky.   The atmosphere was comfortable and not too crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Comfortable enough for a quick bowl of ramen and convo. Not comfortable enough that you'd want to hang around long.   Parking is free for 2 hours at the lot behind Constantino's.   Give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent noodles and a great price. It's nice to see more noodle houses coming to Cleveland"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after a motorcycle ride from the west side. Being a balmy spring day, the ride over caused my allergies to act up - so my sinuses were in full stuff mode when we got there. We both ordered the Char Siu, both loving pork, and pretty much everything else included in the bowl. It came out quickly, was hot, flavorful, and delicious. We both slurped up our bowls with great pleasure. By the end of my bowl, I could breathe again! We will definitely be back to try many more delicious noodle bowls!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for carry out. The place was packed for lunch on a weekday.  Got the miso ramen bowl and the pork cutlet bowl. The pork bowl has a delicious dark broth. My son wolfed down the miso noodle dish."}
{"text":"I have been raving about this place to anyone who will listen to me! This ramen blew me away and the flavor of the Tonkotsu broth is pure bliss! I joked with my boyfriend that I would only eat this if I worked in the area- yes it's that good!  I ordered the Pork Bowl and my boyfriend ordered the Pork Belly. Both bowls came with mushrooms, corn, a half of an egg and scallions. I hardly ever finish a bowl of food that big but I scarfed this down in record time. This is a no frills place. The mural is colorful, they have about 6 tables for seating. They have a handful of drinks to choose from and other than that they only have the ramen bowls- no sides and no appetizers. You don't need the extras when the main dish is great all on it's own."}
{"text":"Food here is okay (ramen is passable for Cleveland standards) and the student discount is a plus! I would stick with the first two most popular options (#1 and #2 I think).  Would not order online or by phone here, because I've had multiple instances where I came after the given ready time and they *just* start my food when I get there. If I have any pet peeve, it's food not being ready by the time THEY gave to me.   Lines can get very long during a workday lunch hour. I've also noticed that they do a sloppier job with their food preparation during busy hours, so I would suggest going before or after peak meal times!"}
{"text":"This place was good for Cleveland, but not amazing if you want great ramen. The pork belly broth was watery and not very tasteful, but the pork was decent and tender. Staff was very polite and kind. Not bad for a college campus."}
{"text":"First time in a Ramen shop, and it was a good experience.  Daughter and I wanted a quick bite before heading down to Severance Hall for a concert, and this place hit the spot on a cold night.  My daughter ordered the pork belly Ramen which had a milky-style broth and huge chunks of pork.  I ordered the tempura shrimp Ramen which had great texture and crunch, until the bottom portions of the shrimp (submerged in the broth) started to get soggy; it was in a more clear broth.  I doused the shrimp with soy sauce from a pink bottle with \"Hello Kitty\" on the side...love it!  Both bowls were absolutely huge and quite filling.  The noodles were fun to \"slurp\" up.  We also decided to try their teriyaki wings.  The meat inside was very moist, but the skin was on the rubbery side...nice flavor overall.  The bottled, jasmine infused honey tea I drank was floral and refreshing.  So glad I gave that a try!  We were in and out in less than 1/2 hour, perfect for our needs.  I you are looking for a quick and reasonably priced meal in the University Circle area, this spot is a good bet."}
{"text":"Warm melty broth and perfect noodles!   Located not far from the Cleveland Museum of Art, this spot fit perfectly. No:1 Char Siu Soup, with added pork belly and a No:10 Miso Ramen Soup. The rich pork broth base in the Char Sui was very flavorful. Adding the extra pork belly, wasn't necessary, but took the dish to meaty heights! The Miso was light and flavorful, no meat necessary. Add to these the perfectly cooked ramen and you've got yourself a great meal!"}
{"text":"There are exactly three places in Cleveland to get ramen worth anything. Xinji, Mason's Creamery, and Otani. While Otani is the least of the three, it's fast casual and always available! I always get the roasted pork or pork belly. Both are great choices!  Note: No, I have not been to the new Noodle Cat in Crocker. The old one, however, was overpriced and inconsistent."}
{"text":"Definitely one the best Ramen Restaurant that I have been to. The soup base is excellent, specifically not too salty or thick. They rival the famous Ramen restaurant in Tokyo station that I have been to.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Love this place! The miso broth is to die for and the fried chicken I get in my bowl is delicious. You can't go wrong with the tempura shrimp either. Everything is good!!"}
{"text":"Sold thrilled that Cleveland finally has an authentic and delicious ramen shop! Had the Pork belly ramen and it was tasty. The bone broth was rich and noodles were perfectly cooked. Will def come back and try every single item on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my second time here at Otani Noodle, and I am a fan! Its a cute place inside with a few tables to sit down and two huge fans for ventilation. (There's no Air conditioning as far as I can tell) The noodles taste delicious and fresh, and the Tonkatsu broth is creamy and savory (a bit on the saltier side for my taste). Also, I appreciate the big portion sizes that they give for the Tonkatsu pork. There's no skimping on the meat, so that's a huge plus! I think the prices could be a dollar or so cheaper ($7-9), but that's based on the price comparison with noodle dishes from nearby restaurants. I would recommend this place for a quick sit down meal, given its streetside open-door vibe, or take it to go if all the tables are taken. There's some tables and benches all along the Uptown walking pathway, so that could potentially be another place to dine.   In general, I think Otani Noodle does the job well for a satisfying ramen fix!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had the shoyu ramen and the broth was delicious. Interestingly, the soup contained corn but it was a good addition. My only gripe is that they give half of a boiled egg, not two halves."}
{"text":"Had the project belly bowl and it was great and full of flavor! Seating is tight but well worth it.  Staff was very friendly and suggested great options for a first time visit. If I was a local this place would be a regular for me."}
{"text":"Out of all of the ramen places I have visited, Otani noodle is pretty average. I ordered one of the specials which was a super spicy ramen and it made my stomach upset. I normally love very spicy food, but this meal wasn't very good in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was ok.  I think I am too used to California ramen which has a well seasoned egg like Orenchi and a richer broth.   My daughter had the veggie ramen and thought hers was fine."}
{"text":"I've been craving a good ramen restaurant in Cleveland for some years now.  Spoiled after savoring the deep and flavorful broth at Ippudo NY multiple times, it was disappointing trying bowl after bowl of mediocre ramen from well intentioned restaurants.  Encouraged by a friend who is more picky about ramen than I am, I decided to make it a date with The Wife to check out this new kid on the Euclid block.    Overall, I'd say that we were pretty pleased with our experience.  Ordering was very easy, the sign being quite clear about your order choices. The lady behind the counter was not very friendly appearing or seemingly happy to be there.  We ordered the charsiu and the chicken cutlets, priced $11.95 and $10.95 respectively.  Decor was nice and the tables were small, but trendy.  There was AC so it appears that they are listening to reviewers.    Good things: good broth, probably best ramen broth I've had in CLE. Not as deep and rich as Ippudo, but definitely plenty complex and creamy.  Generous serving of the noodles.  Perfectly done chicken cutlets.  The charsiu was tasty, but it wasn't really what we expected, since the restaurant is owned by Chinese people.  Food was delivered quickly and hot.   Less good things: not enough broth - it really felt like they skimped out on the broth.  Noodles were barely covered.  For the premium price, I like some more broth.  The noodles were a bit overcooked to me- I expect ramen noodles to have a decent amount of chew to them and these were soft. Good flavor though. I think that they should do soft boiled eggs, not the Chinese savory kinds.    Overall, I was pleased with my experience.  This was enough for me not to crave ramen in other cities any more.  Hopefully they'll continue to respond to critiques and will be successful.  Suspect that they'll do well."}
{"text":"My wife and I came out here last week for two reasons. First to check out the area, because she may be working at UH. Second, because she is a ramen junkie... I'm kind of ambivalent to the fare.  Anyway, glad we came between semesters because the place is quite small. Ordering at the counter is easy and the menu is small, but there are enough options to satisfy..  I had the tempura shrimp ramen and my wife had the pork belly; we split an order of teriyaki wings. Everyth g was good and came out fast. My wife lived in Japan for a few years and said this was middle of the road ramen, but good for Cleveland. As a side mention, the owner was very friendly and chatted us up for a few minutes."}
{"text":"I felt their ramen was very easy to cook coz they seem used 3 min to bring our food, and curry fish balls was cold and tasted bad. I think I would never come back that restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very tasty but somewhat pricey at $9-11 per bowl. We got the udon tonkatsu and Tom yum gung and we loved it. The tom yum gung had more fish sauce and vinegar than what I'm used to, but I know my husband thought it was perfect. Great, fast meal (casual, college meal) and would come here again.  Love the fact there was Asian bottled drinks as well."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overpriced for what it gives you. This isn't a restaurant with servers. You simply pay for your ramen and select a table yourself. Avg price for a bowl is $11-12 and the portion size is good, but for me, I feel like anything more than $8 for ramen is pricey.   Service isn't as welcoming as I expected. One good thing is that Case students get discounts! Overall atmosphere is pretty quiet, but the restaurant is crowded."}
{"text":"The pork belly is fantastic!  Five stars for the food. It's a bit pricey for noodles but the quality is there and I keep coming back, especially now they have the air conditioning working again."}
{"text":"Otani Noodle serves the best ramen I have ever had in my life!!! The Tonkotsu broth used in many of their dishes is completely out of this world. Their dishes are all a combination of unique broths, varied forms of noodles, vegetables, and exquisitely cooked protein. I can not recommend Otani Noodle highly enough!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is super good. It's the best ramen place I've had, and I absolutely love the pork belly ramen."}
{"text":"Cleveland desperately needs a decent ramen shop. And this little noodle shop new in the Uptown scene does the job! They have a small menu of ramen, including some non-pork bases. I got the char siu tonkatsu ramen instead of the pork belly one, because I didn't want it heavy on the meat. The char siu roasted pork came in thin slices, which was actually refreshing. (I personally don't like too much of the meat in my ramen, so that's just me). I love how the broth itself was slightly sweeter, possibly from the corn they added. In addition, they had the typical mushrooms, soft boiled egg, seaweed, and scallions. They also have a pork belly one, which adds more of that fatty, richness to the ramen. They don't have a spicy option or black garlic oil, but they do have chili oil on the tables that you can add to your spicy level.   The food came out quickly in less than 10 minutes on a Sunday evening. Not too much seating though, so it would be hard to sit more than 6 - 7 people if you came in a group.   Excited to come back to try the other noodles on the menu. Glad there's a good noodle place in uptown, especially thinking about the winters ahead."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a group the ramen I got #1 was really good I'm so glad I came out to try this place out."}
{"text":"Meh is right. Better is definitely achievable. But it's the only ramen spot in there area, so try it out for yourself and see what you think."}
{"text":"Only been here once, but easily the best asian spot within University Circle (and yes, I'm asian). The other places down the street are a diluted, bastardized vision of americanized asian cuisine.  Minus one star. For price (they are definitely on the higher end of the spectrum for noodle spots compared to ones I've been to around the world), and for the noodles. I heard they are using packaged noodles, as opposed to in-house home-made, which would totally justify the price."}
{"text":"This was supposed to be Cleveland's best ramen but it was so average.. actually below average.. I've never seen broccoli being put in ramen before. And I ordered tonkatsu which should be roasted pork but instead I got Katsu: fried pork. As you can imagine, fried pork in broth immediately turns soggy. You can tell the katsu is reheated from a frozen state as it was not even heated. The portion size was alright but for $12 I was really expecting something better. I will not be getting ramen here again but perhaps the rice bowls are better. If I absolutely have nothin else to eat and I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A solid choice for japanese style ramen. The pork belly is my personal favorite. You can tell the food is premade because sometime the pork or eggs are cold and it makes it quite upsetting. I usually dunk it and wait for it to heat up a bit. I will come back here mainly because they dont have much competition here in cleveland though the second something better comes along goodbye otani!"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese-style ramen shop that is popular in University Circle! It's right across from Case Western, so I imagine that tons of students benefit from having this place nearby. The best dishes are the char siu or the pork belly. The vegetarian is not bad either as an option. The udon and seafood choices are fine if you're in the mood, but not the main stars here.  Overall, the soups tend to have more of a soy sauce based broth, from what I can tell. The portions are hearty for what you can get. The char siu flavor is distinctly Chinese so keep that in mind as this is different from a Japanese style ramen.  The shop itself is cool - just a few tables with a huge accent wall with colorful art. Say hi to the owner (named Joyce) if you go!"}
{"text":"Frikken dope. Best ramen I've had in Cleveland. Both the miso broth and the tonkatsu broth are fantastic and the noodles are a good chew, definitely not soggy. They're generous with the toppings and the portions are great. Their spicy sauce is homemade and is pretty much a fresher Lao Gan Ma (the quintessential spicy sauce).   They offer predominantly noodles here (add a dollar if you want udon instead of ramen) and four soup bases to choose from, no momofuku-y addendums like steamed buns etc. The only reason they don't have the fifth star is because there's no air conditioning in the establishment which honestly adds to the noodle house experience but that might change in the days to come."}
{"text":"100% the best ramen in the city! Its tiny but absolutely incredible! Its also super fast, i was in and out in under 30 minutes which is great for lunch if you work nearby.  I got the chicken ramen bowl, packed with flavor. I dont have any other references to go off of as far as authentic ramen but this truly did hit the spot with my belly.The owner Joyce is so helpful and sweet. She actually told me that Otani Noodle uses the real alkaline noodle for the true chewy texture of Japanese ramen which is why its so yummy and its truly authentic and one of a kind in cleveland.  Its a tad pricy i mean considering youre paying for ramen and you can get a 10 pack at walmart for $1.00 i guess they have to charge more haha. But otherwise i dont have any negatives to say about Otani."}
{"text":"Not great ramen. Soup tasted like out of a bag. Did not get the feeling that they slow cooked the broth or anything. Will not be back."}
{"text":"In looooove. The food is amazing. I got the pot belly and my friend got the t.... can't remember but it was fried chicken. The broth was sooo simply delicious and everything went well with each other, flavor-wise. However, I felt that there was a lot of scallion, it's okay though; I moved them to the side.   The service was pretty nice too. (:  Coming back soon for sure."}
{"text":"The best ramen in Cleveland. I had the char siu and will be back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Don't let the tiny size of the restaurant deceive you, they make some really good ramen! I've been to all the other places in town that serve ramen and this is one of the best, if not the best place for it."}
{"text":"When I first found out a new ramen place was coming to campus, I honestly didn't have high hopes for it. In fact, it took me several months before I finally decided to just give it a try, and then I went twice in one week.  Honestly, its not the most amazing ramen I've ever had, but it definitely is able to satisfy that ramen craving that you sometimes get. I've tried both the Char Siu and the Miso Ramen. -Char Siu: the tonkotsu broth is nice and rich, and I appreciate the fact that it has more flavor than just saltiness. The Char Siu is quite tender and flavorful. They did somewhat overdo the scallions though. -Miso Ramen: This is significantly lighter in flavor. I ordered this since I wasn't feeling so great and I wanted a cleaner soup. I didn't like how they use broccoli though.   Overall its a pretty cool store, and the ramen is decently priced and pretty good. Definitely a good option for those cold winter days coming up."}
{"text":"This place is SMALL but the food was pretty good!! I ordered the curry bowl with chicken cutlet, and the other two in our group got the regular ramen with pork and chicken cutlet.  The sizes were fair for the price, but I was not impressed with my order.  It was mostly rice, and I was having a lot of doubts about the chicken (pink and gummy inside).  However, that was probably on me for ordering curry at the noodle place!  The ramen was great, it had a good portion of noodles and a wide variety of fresh toppings.  I would definitely come back to try the ramen, but just know that there are about 4 tables in the whole place."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for good ramen to come to cleveland so this place was a must to visit. The pictures looked great so decided to stop in. Ramen is an art. Luckily for them CIA is down the street.  Plus: great fast service."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! You're lucky if there is no line. A+++  Highly recommend the pork belly with extra noodles!"}
{"text":"Food mediocre and they forgot our order and it wasn't busy. They compensated by giving us free eggs. Wow!!"}
{"text":"For ramen in Cleveland, this is pretty good. Would not say its at the level of some of the other ramen shops I've been to on the coasts.  Almost always go with the #1 Char-siu. Broth is good as are noodles. Egg is often over cooked however. Still a great place to grab ramen in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! I was skeptical at first to be honest; could ramen actually be something to treat myself with? The answer is (most definitely) YES!   The location itself is small, there is limited indoor seating, and there isn't a defined order line up to the registers. Also I think it would be smart if they started asking for the name of the person getting an order because once the semester starts they will be super busy and I imagine it will become more and more difficult to keep tract of who ordered what.   That stuff being said, the inside is really cool! The painted wall is really interesting and adds a trendy atmosphere. But what is most impressive is the food (as it should be)! I ordered the #5, Torikatsu Chicken, and it was divine! I actually cannot praise it enough. The fried chicken was tender and crispy and the broth was wicked flavorful.   I will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"A perfectly decent place for ramen if you're OK with the offerings having a strong Chinese influence, whether in the flavors or certain ingredients like the char siu. I'm of Cantonese descent myself and found my bowl of ramen to be quite satisfying because it had so many familiar, reassuring Chinese flavors.   Although this place can be super busy, with a line almost stretching to the door at peak periods, things move along quite quickly. Even though there's only about a dozen tightly-packed seats inside, folks slurp down their bowls and generally don't linger any longer than they have to, so seats do turn over regularly. Service is fast and efficient.  It all might not be the most authentic ramen from a Japanese perspective, particularly if you've traveled and dined extensively in Japan. Some bowls like the #1 char siu bowl are slightly spendy too. I suspect, however, that there aren't many quality Asian establishments in this part of the city or in the greater metropolitan area, so Otani wins by default."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen, broth, and the fried chicken is a delight. Very fast and friendly service, and the location is within easy walking distance of University Hospitals and Case Western. I wish this place existed when I was at Case, but having them available with a sick kiddo at UH really came in handy. Kudos to Otani Noodle!"}
{"text":"Ramen is one of my favorite things in the world. I will eat good ramen, I will eat bad ramen. Otani is ok ramen. Being vegetarian, this is basically only a review for the vegetarian options here, which are fairly limited. It is a soy based broth I believe. This is my only complaint - it isn't very flavorful. The noodles themselves were just the right texture, and the vegetables were fresh. I added some sriracha sauce and that made everything a little better, but I'd like to see them up their game on the vegetarian broth. Also, it looks like their location out in mayfield heights has a lot more vegetarian options that look delicious. Bring some of those over! I'll def be back but would love to see an expanded menu."}
{"text":"I have to say I have tried ramen in nyc twice and this place had some good ramen. The staff was friendly and it was a quick service as well. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place it's tasty. The owner Joyce is so helpful and sweet she's awesome. I haven't tried many things yet but the food was delicious. The workers are for the most part helpful. The noodles are fresh and very tasty. The soups have very good flavors that will have you coming back. I am a fan of this place and wI'll be back."}
{"text":"Never had ramen before and looked up reviews and this place had the best reviews for ramen and they weren't wrong it was super good!  Also free parking behind the grocery store across the street"}
{"text":"I'm not exactly an expert on authentic ramen, but yum!  We've ordered delivery from here a few times, and we've been impressed each time.  It's a little bit expensive, but the portions are generous and the quality is on point.  My husband pretty much always gets the Jigoku spicy ramen, so it must be good.  I'm partial to the torikatsu (chicken) as far as protein goes, but I've tried it with multiple broth options. This is the only place I've ever tried tonkatsu broth and I love it, but the shoyu and miso are pretty delicious too.  When you order ramen to-go or delivery, the broth is packaged separately from the \"stuff\" which helpfully prevents sogginess upon arrival.  The only appetizer we've tried was the edamame and they were pretty tasty.  It's kind of cool that you can get Ramune Japanese soda as well.  I plan to slowly make my way through the menu, and maybe eventually make myself venture from the noodle bowls to the rice bowls-- but it's hard to branch out when the soup is so good.  I still haven't actually been to the physical location so I can't tell you anything about atmosphere or service, but I can wholeheartedly recommend their ramen."}
{"text":"First real ramen in Cleveland. Other places are fake. This is how Ramen supposed to taste. Stop by and give them a try if you never had."}
{"text":"Noodles had a nice chew. Pork was above average and sauce lacked professional care; I believe they used a base that was institutional and not made from scratch. The vegetarian ramen sauce was very good. And veggies were cooked al dente. Expensive for what  you get."}
{"text":"Wandered in on a cold snowy day and ordered myself a spicy ramen.  The broth was decent but overly salty and lacking depth of flavor.  The regular broth was a bit better, but for the price, they need to include more toppings.  Also, the cha siu pork is not cooked properly.  It should be succulent, but it is actually tough."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch before going to the MOCA (free day!) and the Hessler Street Fair.  My wife and daughter had the chicken (#5) and enjoyed it, I had the Tom Young Gong (#6) which was delightfully spicy and had large shrimp but no scallops.  Service was very fast.  This is really about a 4.5 star review, to be perfect they could drop the prices a couple of dollars and give you something better to sit on than those plastic high stools."}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews for Otani I went in expecting to have the best ramen I've had in Cleveland.   Otani did not in any way meet those expectations.   I tried the #2 (ramen with pork belly) that was one of their top sellers.   The pork belly itself was far and away the worst I've ever had - borderline dry, not particularly tender and no where near the flavor you would want in fresh pork belly.   The corn in the meal tasted like it was poured directly from a can into my bowl, there was nothing remotely fresh tasting about the meal.   There are plenty of options in the city for great Ramen, Otani is definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"The taste is great. We went between lunch and dinner, so there was no line. Would have been 5 starts, but one of our bowls, Tom Yum, had so many noodles and not much else. The pork belly was fantastic and had a good amount of everything."}
{"text":"Best permanent ramen shop in Cleveland, at least until the one in Ohio City opens up. That said, I probably won't be back. I eat quite a bit of ramen when I travel but this is the only place both my wife and I feel bad after eating their ramen... the broth just isn't done right and isn't properly made/filtered. It's \"shortcut\" ramen. I've been twice now and while it tastes good when you eat it, you'll feel it for the next 4-5 hours going through your system. I'm sure if you're in college your stomach will be fine but as someone 5 years past that point.... And considering the price, that's just unacceptable. A $12 bowl of ramen should be extremely good quality. I've had $7 bowls of ramen that were better quality."}
{"text":"This is one of Cleveland's only ramen places. Though other cities may have more choices, this place fills the void pretty well. I really like their charsiu, and the new spicy broth is pretty tasty. The have a really good broth base, and a few food options to pick from. Its small and tends to get pretty hot, but getting it to go works, as long as you accept the noodles will be a bit stuck together. Good sized bowl for the price."}
{"text":"Broth was a bit lacking in flavor. Quality of ingredients was fine; however choice of ingredients was suspect compared to most authentic ramen shops. The food is really cheap, plus they offer student discounts. Service is quite fast but the shop can get quite packed when they start getting multiple orders."}
{"text":"After a nice paddle on the Cuyahoga I figured I would try Otani Noodle on the way home.  Located on Euclid Avenue next to the CIA building, Otani is a cool place to get some tasty ramen.  The small space is sharp looking in red and black, with the counter and kitchen on one side and four tables on the other side.  The menu is up on the wall on video screens; the focus is clear just some well composed noodle bowls.   I picked the Shrimp Tempura Ramen, which came up rather quickly.  A nice big bowl of noodles with a shoyu broth, 4 large shrimp, and nice selection of vegies.  The portion size is very good, but a bit deceptive since the bowl widens out at the top, so it seems smaller then it actually is.  The noodles and broth were excellent, great flavor, perfectly cooked and as far as you can imagine from the cheap ramen you ate in College.  The tempura shrimp were very nice, especially when you let them warm up in the broth.  The seaweed, corn, broccoli and scallions added some nice crunch and color to the dish.  If you are looking for some excellent ramen check out Otani Noodles, it is a very well executed and focused noodle shop and well worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is solid ITO ramen noodles, broth and meat! OMG the broth is so good! Meat - pork belly, shrimp tempura, chicken or pork tonkatsu, it's all good. Price is very good. Ask for the egg addition. Very happy they are in business and I'd go back regularly. Take out is recommended if you don't live in the area as they package everything up nicely and separately; the only thing you need to do when you get home is to heat up the broth, which keeps the noodles from getting mushy and meat from getting dry in the microwave. Check it out~!"}
{"text":"I ate at Otani Noodle with my parents after visiting Case. Of course, my parents prefer asian foods, but Cleveland has shown me that there aren't many choices in asian cuisine in the city. It's understandable since there isn't a large asian population. However, please also read my review with a grain of salt. I am Chinese and I eat asian food predominantly in NYC. So! I have been wow-ed with many great ramen restaurants in my life.   I didn't order the popular ramen bowls, but my parents did. I got the tom yum dong because I wanted something different. It was actually somewhat spicy. I didn't expect that since most tom yum soups taste more sour to me. It wasn't horrible, but I also didn't find it to be amazing. That being said, Otani Noodle is located near campus and it seems to be a great option for students to get their noodle soup fix especially on a cold, rainy day."}
{"text":"Broccoli in ramen needs to be rethought.  The ramen is okay but not great.   This place has the potential for greatness, but needs a bit more push.    Why try to be the best ramen place in Cleveland when you can be the best ramen place on planet earth?  That's a better standard to try to reach, then people will fly in from around the world to eat here rather than just drive in from Westlake...  My suggestion is to use a place like Ippodo as your standard and improve upon that.  You're not reaching high enough.  Right now, it's just mediocre, but there's energy and sweetness there that can make it truly amazing."}
{"text":"Recommend tonkatsu broth over shoyu. 2$ porky belly add-on gets you two pieces. Was a little rough, and not just the meat. Great with corn!"}
{"text":"Great soup, fast service, can't complain! I always get take out, the seafood and vegetable bowls are really great. The pork belly is also good!"}
{"text":"I'm a very big fan of ramen so when this place open I had to give it a try. Considering the ramen market in Cleveland, I'd say this is the best RAMEN place I've had so far. Compared to other cities (NY, San Francisco etc..) it's not the best but for Cleveland market it's not too bad. I tried the Tom Yum Gong. Overall it was pretty tasty. The flavor was rich however there was a lemony undertone I didn't care for much. Also one thing to note about this place is it isn't the cheapest. 2 dishes came out to around $26 dollars and some change.(A bit high in my opinion)  Price points aside I'd give this place another try to checkout a few other things on the menu. Traditionally (In Japan) Ramen is a fairly cheap yet hearty dish so the price change here is offsetting but hey that's common for most items in a smaller market. Supply and demand ;-) ."}
{"text":"If you ever have been to Japan and expect what you are used to, then, soup is too sweet.  It could suit as a temporary fix for ramen crave. Miso ramen soup did not taste like miso at all, as someone already mentioned. They have really good ra-yu chilli oil at hand."}
{"text":"The establishment is does not use their AC or turn down low enough so indoor dining is unpleasant.  I got the pork belly to go and ate at the picnic tables next to moca. I liked the way they packed the meal keeping the broth separate.  The portion was more than enough for lunch and would be okay for dinner but not as generous to allow for more than one portion.  The ramen is overpriced at 12$, i would expect higher quality at this price.  I will say I enjoyed the flavor of the broth.  For 8$ this place would be a good lunch option, but as is, I left expecting a little bit more.  This is a brand new place, and I would like try it again in a couple months to see if the quality improves.  I'm still thankful for the relatively recent diversity in University Circle."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch yesterday hoping for a hot tasty meal. Unfortunately the Miso Ramen AND Torikatsu had very little flavor in their broth/base. The miso vegetables were rubbery but the Ramen had good texture. The torikatsu chicken had a bold chicken bouillon flavor but it was the only flavor detectable. Not a Ramen expert but have had Ramen many times both US and Japan so I have a good background on how it should taste."}
{"text":"Picked #1 from the menu and it was delicious! The meat just melts in your mouth and the broth was excellent. I highly recommend it if you have an appetite for excellent noodles and  want it in 5 minutes or less."}
{"text":"Not bad for Cleveland. Ramen is ok. Soup was tasty. Only thing bad is no AC and the place has bar stools which I don't like sitting on. But that's me only. Will recommend to friends"}
{"text":"TLDR: weak tonkatsu broth, no control of noodle doneness, flavorless pork, server didn't know about togarashi, egg was over cooked, found a GIANT hair in my ramen.   Just moved to CLE from SF and had visited Japan earlier this spring. I eat ramen prob once a week at a minimum.   The good: very quick service, convenient location, lots of options. The corn was good enough.   The bad: giant nasty hair in my ramen. The broth lacked the depth I'm used to. The pork shoulder didn't have the smokiness that you would expect. My egg was over cooked.   Overall 3 stars but an extra star deducted for giant hair in my ramen."}
{"text":"I went to place after taking a hot yoga class and it was very tasty! I had the vegetable bowl. It has great flavor and was made fairly quickly! The staff was very friendly. Only downside was that the air was on and was making me get the sniffles. Oh and also the cup of water was in a real small. But other than those 2 things, it was a good experience and I will have to keep it in mind when I am in that area'"}
{"text":"The broth for the 1st and 2nd item on the menus is rich and authentic. Noodles were  grear and the meat was well made. Overall very satisfied and the foods were made very quickly too. Good place to grab some good noodles."}
{"text":"I was led here by 4 star reviews, but sadly I am disappointed with this place. I would only come here again if I needed a quick fix and somehow couldn't even make it to Noodle Cat. To sum it up this place is a Chinese knock-off of Japanese ramen. I chose the Pork Belly Tonkotsu Ramen. While there is flavor in the broth it lacks the depth of flavor. It seems that they put additives just to make it taste good, but not long hours of boiling a broth down with quality ingredients. There was no lip smacking, gelatinous, feel to the broth that you should normally get with a good tonkotsu broth.  The pork belly seemed to be braised well, but there was waaaaayyy too much five spice in that braising liquid. Five spice isn't used very much if at all in Japanese cuisine and was a clearly Chinese dish they added. I don't feel like the flavors went together. They should opt for something a little more mild in flavor and let the broth shine. The positive side of my ramen is that the noodle were cooked perfectly to my liking. Very nice chewy texture. Maybe Cleveland hasn't seen very good ramen yet to know."}
{"text":"Possibly the best ramen in Cleveland. I have been here several times already and they are very consistant. Char Siu is my favorite here, a little over $11. Four pieces of Pork Belly and very good soup. The only downside (to me) is that I hate corn in my ramen, so I had to pick them out, no biggee. On the campus of one of America's oldest universities, Case Western established in 1800's. Worth a visit if you are a ramen fan. They also have other dishes."}
{"text":"So, anyone in Cleveland knows how bad our ramen options are (whoever says Noodlecat has obviously never been there). I decided to try Otani that just opened last week.   Broth was good, a little light and not exactly traditional tonkatsu flavor, but literally the best option around. I asked for an egg which they forgot.  The pork is tough. I'll definitely go back and try the chasu or pork belly. My noodles I think were probably made the day before,. LOTS of clumps. This is a huge turn off for me (and part of the reason why I stopped even trying at Noodlecat). I'm interesting in trying again and seeing what other options they have and how fresh it is on different days.   As far as ramen in Cleveland, it's an option and maybe the best option. As far as authentic ramen period, you might crave more than this."}
{"text":"Picked the #1 ramen and it was delicious. The service was very quick and the staff was friendly! I would recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Love the Pork Belly ramen, the best I have ever had in Ohio. Sincerely recommend all noodle lovers to try.  Definitely will go back regularly."}
{"text":"Walked past this place in University Circle. Was surprised to see a ramen spot in Cleveland because we didn't find many Asian people in this state, Ohio, to begin with. Me and my mom were missing Asian cuisine.  Saw in the window of this place ramen and udon choices. Granted it was really hot this day 80-90 degree weather, I still wanted some soup.   I ordered the simple udon soup. I think a bowl was around $8.50.   Pretty basic. It tastes like the ramen you buy from the Asian grocery market in the refrigerator section you can make from the microwave. And cross my heart, I am not over exaggerating on this. The one where you cook the noodles in boiling water and just add the packet of beef flavored MSG.   The pros. The soup came out quickly.... Within 5 minutes... Hrrrmm, now that sounds suspicious."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was happy to find this little gem conveniently located by the Case Western campus. The quick and friendly service, seriously tasty vegetable udon, and cozy atmosphere were just what this out of place California girl needed.   Two vegetarian thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Wow. Hands down the BEST ramen in Cleveland. They are fresh and fast with great flavor. I'm just sad that they opened 10 days before I move!"}
{"text":"Finally! An authentic ramen place finally opens in the area! As the city definitely lacks good ramen joints, I would have to say this is the best ramen I have had in the city. I usually get the #2 pork belly and it is a great portion size and delicious. I love the accompaniments in it - especially the corn which is different than any other place! The portion size is huge, you get a great amount of meat and broth and noodles, that you will surely be full afterwards! Their chicken wings are good too for a side if you can fit them into your belly.   They also do great take out and package it up nicely so the noodles dont get soggy. Best of all, they are reasonably priced!  As ramen is my favorite food - I am happy to drive over to this area to get some good authentic ramen!"}
{"text":"First time here and will be back the next time I crave Ramen. The broth was perfect and I love the fast casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I knew something was different the moment I saw curry fish balls on the menu at a ramen restaurant. The Cantonese music was another hint, and the Chinese beverages was another hint. When I was able to converse with all the staff in Cantonese, it dawned on me - this ramen restaurant is run exclusively by Chinese people.  Not to say that this fact in itself takes away from the quality of the food. The ramen is still pretty good, and the broth is solid. However, the flavor of the ramen itself does taste distinctly Cantonese. I ordered the miso ramen with char siu, and the ramen had more of a sesame oil flavor than a miso flavor. When I order miso ramen at places in LA and New York, the miso is very very strong, though the miso ramen at Otani tasted more like sesame instant noodles. Additionally, I felt a Cantonese influence in how light the broth was - I expect miso ramen broth to be heavier and thicker.  Some may question authenticity, but then what exactly does one call a Chinese take on a Japanese dish that has its roots in a Chinese dish (liamen)?  The answer: pretty good noodles! I would not rate this as highly as ramen places in major cities, who tend to spend days to prepare their homemade ramen broths, use the highest quality pork, and frequently make their own noodles. However, Otani is good if you're looking for a quick fix, and in many ways reminded me of the type of instant noodles that I can get at Hong Kong diners. Solid, filling, and fairly light.  I plan on coming back and trying their curry fish balls for sure. It's by no means a Japanese staple, but as a Cantonese person myself, I'm always looking for good quality curry fish balls."}
{"text":"We have been watching and waiting for Otani to open, and happily today I was able to go and grab porkbelly udon soup takeaway for lunch.  The broth was delicious, the porkbelly pieces generously sized and had great flavor.  The udon noodles tasted perfect.  I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu.  It's lovely to have this new addition to the lineup on Euclid Ave."}
{"text":"This place is a solid ramen joint.  The walls are cool and colorful, the staff is helpful and efficient, and the product they serve helps me with my ramen craving. As I have had better ramen in bigger cities such as L.A. and Chicago, for Cleveland, this place is top notch. I can't wait for the new opening!  When we got our bowls of ramen we didn't talk for 15 minutes straight. I just kept eating and slurping and drinking (because it was spicy).   Ramen is everything. Great place."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken ramen and my friend ordered the veggie ramen. Broth was full of flavor. Chicken was crisp and excellent. Noodles had a good bite. Thin and classic ramen. Really enjoyed it. Went in feeling a stomach ache and a bit of cold symptoms and left feeling pretty good. Jasmine honey tea was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found this place while walking by university circle. The prices were good, portions were generous. I had the char-siu which was pretty good. Service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"They are known for their Ramen bowls, so I've heard. I decided to go rouge and order an Udon bowl. The noodles were good, nice with a bite. The bowl included corn kernels, which to me was kinda off-putting. There wasn't much flavour to the broth, so my friend and I had to add spicy oil from a container on the tables. Overall, it was ok. I will try the Ramen next time. Hopefully it will be better tasting than the Udon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after a wondering around university circle a bit. The place was packed for the amount of seats they have but not crowded if that makes any sense. The menu is pretty straight forward. They have a few bowls already made up or you can do a create your own. I went with the seafood soup while my wife got the roasted pork... The seafood soup was great. I added pork belly and it was super flavorful. Not a lot of seafood but it  hit the spot. My wife soup had overpowering aftertaste that i cant describe nor was i fond of but she enjoyed it. We will be back next time down here... Im still looking for  a ramen spot to take the place of the one i visited in Philly, but this one will do as a close 2nd."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very tasty and quick service. Very efficient management.  Highly recommend the Tom Yum! Enjoy"}
{"text":"You know there isn't that many ramen places to choose from so there isn't much of a competition.  When you first come in, you get s feel of authentic vibes.  They have high tops with stools to sit on.  You can possibly fit 4-6 people comfortably at each table.    The workers all stand behind their work station, getting ready for anyone and everyone! The prices are averagely priced for a ramen and you get a nice portion for it.    If you have some trouble deciding on what you would like, check out the pictures they provide on the wall!  They have one screen on there dedicated to showing pictures and a glimpse of the menu.    The hubby, my friend, and I ordered the spicy ramen.  The spicy ramen wasn't really that spicy in my opinion, but they have chili oil at each table to add to your ramen.  The broth was pretty bland.  The noodles were cooked to perfection.  And the belly pork was so tender and juicy!!! I was very very pleased with the pork and would probably come back to try a different ramen with the belly pork!  Once we ordered, she asked if I was a case student and I said no.  But she asked because case students receive a 10% discount!! But you need to show your ID.  So don't try to fool them!  Overall, I'd bring anyone here with a ramen craving!"}
{"text":"New addition to the Uptown area. For vegans/vegetarians - get the veggie and replace the ramen with Udon noodle. Quick service - fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"5 Stars. No. 1 noodle in Cleveland. I have my lunch there today, and Pork Belly is amazing. It was cooked very very fast, which more beyond my expectation. Professional food, good service, and excellent eating experience. I will highly recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Otani Noodle is a small, walk-up Raman house located in the heart of East Cleveland on Euclid Avenue. They offer freshly made in house ramen, broth, and meats are brought together with EXCELLENT presentation to quench all of ones noodle needs.   This location is quite a bit smaller than the downtown location, and only affords 4 or so tables if one wishes to eat here. However, it turns out monumental things can come in small packages.   To the food: as always, I ordered their Pork Belly ramen with an extra soft boiled egg. I have gotten this many times before, however I just can't dare myself to try something else, as it is so delicious. Also as always, the presentation and flavor were unmatched. The noodles were fresh, the broth had amazing flavor and was excellently crafted, the vegetables were crisp and tasteful, and the pork belly (unseasoned bacon chunks) was juicy; and gave the broth a great flavor as well. One of my favorite parts are the soft boiled eggs. They soak up the flavor of the broth, and taste AMAZING.   The only reason I cannot give them 5 stars as I would have loved to do, is all this flavor comes at a price. Don't get me wrong the portions are definitely enough to satisfy one person, and after adding an extra egg to my bowl, the total came to around $13, and that's without a drink. (which you will need it's very salty) Be prepared for a bill around $15-16 a person.  All in all, if your looking to experience the art that is Otani Noodle's ramen, I would highly, HIGHLY recommend giving this place a chance in spite of them charging restaurant prices. You are never going to find a more finely crafted bowl of ramen short of spending tons at an expensive restaurant or heading to Tokyo. Please eat here!!"}
{"text":"YUM! Perfect meal for a cold cleveland day. I especially love this place because they have plenty of vegetarian options for a ramen place. I prefer the veggie broth or the tom yum style. Shrimp tempura is also phenomenal. Eat in or take out - it's great either way"}
{"text":"Very good noodle place. I had Raman noodles with pork roast (#1) and it was very good. Not a lot of seating, but food was really good."}
{"text":"Technically the best Raman place around case campus. IT IS DOPE, give it a try. -1 star for bad air conditioning, please improve. I've had their noodles two days in a row and now I'm on my way for my third visit."}
{"text":"otani noodle is definitely as close to real authentic ramen that you're going to find in cleveland. my fiancé and i are giant fans of ramen and it's always been one of the things we miss most about living in nyc. otani comes very close to filling the void completely!  we've ordered the pork belly and char-siu ramen. these are both absolutely fantastic. they pack all of the food perfectly for take out in order to maintain the chewiness of the noodle. the problem i had first and foremost was there was no real chicken ramen. they have \"fried\" chicken ramen but this is not the same thing. the broth is definitely on the weaker and milder side, we added a lot of soy sauce to ours. other than these very minor things, otani is fantastic. it is EONS better than noodlecat, which is absolutely horrific.  my only suggestion would be to maybe add some other menu items, such as edamame or dumplings, but i can see why they don't since the restaurant is on the smaller side and a lot of people get take out rather than dining in."}
{"text":"if you been to the authentic ramen shops like Totto ramen in NYC, this is the closest to the authentic ramen taste that u can get here in Cleveland. i've been eating ramen from lots of places and finally theres 1 here near downtown cleveland. not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here yesterday for lunch and had THE BEST experience.  From top to bottom.  The people want to help you enjoy it.  I was given a specific reccomendation---we were checked on twice...This might sound like no big deal for a quick noodle shop they really go above and beyond.  We were on the Momofuku bandwagon in NYC and this place does NOT disappoint.  We're just sad we aren't locals."}
{"text":"Got the charsiu and miso (with charsiu) ramens. Staff was polite and the order showed up quickly and they cleared our dishes right after we got up - 4 stars for service.  We tasted the broths immediately and decided the miso was slightly better. Both were watery and the normal tonkotsu had a very buttery or sweet taste to it. Neither had really deep fulfilling flavors but they weren't bad. The noodles and the charsiu weren't anything special but weren't bad. 3 stars overall.  If you haven't had good ramen before, then this place would be perfectly acceptable. If you have, it'll be a tad underwhelming but still ok (for Cleveland.) I probably wouldn't come back on my own but if someone wanted to go, I'd go again."}
{"text":"I am no longer in Cleveland and I miss Otani Noodle desperately. The torikatsu paired with the Tom Yum was such a delicious experience, and one that was just a minute away from my home. I will miss Otani for the rest of my days. :("}
{"text":"I'm no Ramen expert but this is some good stuff! I ordered it for delivery and everything was super fresh. As soon as I opened it and started eating it my entire office asked where I got it and how to get some. Will be ordering again for sure."}
{"text":"Holy swollen fingers, feet, face, hands and whatever is still remaining from the large amount of salt used in the food, but what else did I expect from eating food using ramen noodles? Trust me, I devoured every last drop, chopsticks in hand, until you could see the every inch of the bowl. It was THAT good.  The variety in the menu lends itself to all appetites  and I would highly suggest taking the advice from the guy or gal behind the register. Each employee appeared to have an extensive knowledge about the variety of food options; I tend to be an ease dropper, which is why I am able to safely say this is true.  Whether you are going to or from class, finishing a yoga class, or are just in the area, stop by Otani. The small dining area allows people to be in and out quickly, or stay and relax, your choice!"}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen place! Probably one of the best ones in Cleveland. I've had the Char Siu and Pork Belly Ramen and they're pretty tasty. They don't give a lot of meat, though. I've also heard that if you get it to go, they give smaller portions."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Workers are so kind, one of the best ramen spots in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"In terms of food quality, I'd highly recommend Otani. One of the best noodles places I've been to. I had their signature Char-siu bowl, which is very tasty, filled with strong flavor and just-the-right-softness charsiu pork.  They're located at the heart of University area, a big plus. My only thing about this place is their seating. I feel the high tables are not exactly a fit for the place, and they're pretty narrow too, so two people facing one another is feasible, but not too comfortable."}
{"text":"HAPPY NEW YEAR yelpers!   After a hot yoga class at Cleveland Yoga earlier this week (on Tuesday, 02 January), I noticed this restaurant across the street so I came in to try the food. I was starving so I glanzed at the menu quickly before ordering. I asked for help and quickly got it from the lady at the cashier machine. I was so hungry that after I ordered, I quickly drove home to induldge.   I ordered a curry chicken rice bowl that was bursting with flavour. It had crispy chicken (crispy on the edges), peas, carrots, and broccoli. The curry was kind of just placed on top of the rice and chicken (see photos). I would have preferred the rice to have been mixed in with the curry but I still tasted the curry so no problem  Overall, this is a great restaurant for those who like a healthy food option. If you like Japanese food then try their noodles, soups, and sushi. The cost of my dish was on the pricey side ($8.95) but I guess it isn't that bad based on how much flavour was in the food.   I went to their Uptown location in the University village district but I read that there is a Mayfield Heights location as well."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any other ramen places in Cleveland because this has become my go-to. It's a great location for students in the area and *PRO TIP* there is free 2 hour parking across the street behind Constantino's! Enter the lot from 115th street. The restaurant itself is small with an artsy interior. They have purse hooks on the tables and bar seating for those eating alone.   The service is always great. Everyone is super friendly. There was a female cashier during one of my visits who enthusiastically chatted with me about the history of women's hairstyles in the Qing Dynasty. LOL. She's so adorable!!!!  Time for the food. I almost always get the pork belly ramen (#2), although today I got the miso ramen and added pork belly. I absolutely love pork belly- it's definitely a treat. Otani's pork belly is packed with umami flavor and oh so tender. You can never go wrong with #2. Today I tried it with miso broth, and it didn't taste as wonderful as it would in its original tonkotsu broth, but still delicious."}
{"text":"I was very happy that there is finally a decent ramen place in the area because Cleveland was in desperate need of one! When I went there I ordered the Tonkotsu pork belly special. I was very happy with the ramen, the noodles were fresh, the meat was tender and the tonkotsu broth was not bad. They also had a decent amount of different types of bottle teas and sodas. I had a great experience but I just wish that they had more different types of toppings that are available for adding on such as bamboo, bean sprouts or other extras. Also, I think that the broth needs more flavor but I was happy enough with it. However, I will be going back because this is the first legit ramen shop in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Wowza! The chicken ramen was amazing! The staff was so inviting and wonderful. Don't miss this place!!"}
{"text":"Just went here over the weekend and I'm a fan! I took my whole fam here so there was a range of ramen tasting expertise. My mom had never tried ramen while I am a ramen fiend. So here's the skinny:  Broth was tops blooby. It was rich, milky and tasted like real tonkotsu broth. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and there was a generous portion of 5 pieces in my bowl! The noodle was delicious--slightly chewy and just the right thickness. The nori pieces were flavorful and even the thinly sliced mu er which I don't usually like were cooked to perfection.  More praise: not to expect too much service but I thought the lady was really nice and gave my mom extra broth since her bowl was kind of dry. One of the reviewers said you have to pay for water but if you just ask for cups of water, they will give you some plastic cups of tap water. You don't have to buy the Chinese and Japanese soda/tea drinks.   Cons: not enough broth! The bowls are big ramen bowls but this place is stingy with their broth. Maybe 1/4 of the bowl is covered in their broth. The egg is just a hard boiled tea egg cut in half instead of the marinated soft boiled egg in traditional ramen. No squid pieces either, oh well. Here's the biggie: NO A/C! They just have some loud fans but are too cheap to install or use some A/C? I don't know what their deal is with this.  Prices are kind of high for a bowl of noodles. They are all $12 and a drink is $3 (all the Chinese grocery stores aren't far and they sell the same thing for $1+). We tipped well b/c there were 5 of us but the stuffiness of the place would be enough for me to tip less if I went alone next time.   Will I come again? Yes, in the winter time! Hopefully this place will invest in a heater."}
{"text":"There are a lot of ramen experts out there who have traveled the globe and can report that Cleveland cannot compare. I have a friend who is also a ramen expert who traveled to the state penitentiary where ramen is a way a life and more valuable commodity than most other worldly possessions. In prison a common ramen meal is called a \"Break\" and is a ramen noodle pack combined with summer sausage, shredded cheese, crushed chips (preferably BBQ or Doritos), hot sauce, mayo, honey and whatever else could be tossed in a bag. My friend made me a Break and it was delicious. This gave me the idea to open a prison style restaurant called Commissary. Saving the funds for start up capital.  Otani Noodle was good ramen. It could compare to the ramen that I have had in coastal cities that people go bonkers for. I am glad to drive out 15 minutes to the east side to eat it. Better than going to the penitentiary for dinner."}
{"text":"We popped into Otani noodle on a quiet Sunday afternoon, just after visiting the Art Museum, which obviously works up an appetite. It's a hunger that can only be quenched by a huge bowl of broth, noodles, and fixins'.   Right off the bat I loved the simple interior and menu. There is minimal seating, bar stool style at maybe 4-5 tables, and you order at the counter. The menu had limited options that even the ramen novice would be able to order with confidence. As a self proclaimed \"ramen junkie\" (shout out to the other Yelp review here that I snagged it from!), I was anxious to see what Otani Noodle was bringing to the table. I was honestly a little skeptical, because it's the odd ball out here in Cleveland- but my husband and I both  were incredibly surprised.   The tonkatsu broth was the perfect blend of delicious. It wasn't too salty and it wasn't too boring, it was just right. The noodles were perfect, and the fixins' in my #1 char sui bowl were just the right amount to bring it all together. This place is legit and they dish some awesome ramen for the Cleveland area.   The only thing holding them back from a 5 star review? The price. I know ramen is a lot of work but at the end of the day, anything with meat in it was $10+. That's high for one person, IMO. Is it worth it? Yes. Will I be back? Heck yes. Is this ramen worth your time? Yes yes and yes. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I had the pork belly noodle which is apparently one of their best sellers. The broth was ok but the combination of a seafood flavor with pork belly had a really terrible after taste I couldn't get past. Also the pork belly was about 90% fat, noodles were chewy and don't think they were cooked all the way I can almost eat anything and couldn't stomach the dish that is one of their best sellers - also had the pork dumplings which were chewy and underwhelming. I'm only giving this place a two cuz they are new and maybe need a little adjusting"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Had roasted pork and curry fish balls.  Service was very good staff was friendly. They have the Japanese sodas.   For my particular one they did just straight up Ramen noodles.   Would highly recommend Otani noodle."}
{"text":"Ok I've been awaiting the arrival of a good ramen place in ohio! I think I've found one! Took my family for a early Saturday dinner and we all had full belly's and smiles on our faces.  A tad pricey at a $75.00 tab for 5 people. Not bad considering they're decent and the only spot in town. So since I don't go to my favorite spot in LA but a couple of times a year this will do just fine!"}
{"text":"This new ramen place opened up on Case campus couple days ago, thought I give it a try since I live around this area. I personally love Asian food, especially Japanese. Here's my review of the place:  We had the tonkutsu and torikatsu (fried chicken fillet ) ramen. Both of them are tonkutsu based broth which tastes like it was made from instant ramen packets. There's absolutely no depth to the broth unlike traditional Japanese ramen, especially tonkutsu which often requires hours and hours of slow cooking. There was a decent amount of fried chicken fillet but they overcooked the fillet, instead of a crispy golden katsu, it was dark brown. The noodle was nothing special, tasted like something I can get from an Asian market. The food itself I would give it a 3/5.   The dining environment: it's 85 degrees outside today and there's no AC in the restaurant. The lighting was horrible, from outside the restaurant I couldn't tell if they were in business hours or not.   The customer service: TERRIBLE beyond description. The asian lady that took our order and also happens to be the only server at the time and looked like she hates her job. We were the only ones to dine in at the time the rest were carryout customers probably because it was too damn hot inside especially when you are eating ramen. When our food came to the table she wanted to check my receipt with the order number (which I can understand you can never be too cautious to serve the right food to the right table), I happen to have my paper folded up and put away, it took me a while to find it and unfold it so I can show her. She gave me a death stare and pushed the food with the serving tray towards me as if I was panhandling. Great customer service for a business that just opened up for less than a week!!! Also we asked for water that never came! Pretty sure I will not be coming back again Otani. The food I could stand, but with this crappy service I'm sure they will do really well."}
{"text":"I had guardedly high hopes for this fast-casual ramen joint, but found the experience a bit of a letdown. This is a meal that tasted good as I was eating it (due to a high content of salt, sugar, and oil), but left me largely unsatisfied and feeling a little bit gross. In my party of three, we tried:   - Torikatsu: A decent broth with reasonably good depth of flavor, a fried chicken cutlet (flavor reference: Wendy's Chicken Nuggets), and a smattering of (seemingly) frozen broccoli florets and corn. Not bad, but far from setting the bar in ramen complexity!  - Vegetable Ramen with Tofu: Ditto. - Katsu Don: A rice bowl featuring soft, sticky, rice with the fried chicken cutlet and a omelette on top. The omelette boasted a couple of slivers of onion and pepper. Again, it tasted good, but I was hankering for some more vegetables and the overabundance of salty/sweet sauce made the meal feel less than nutritious.   The dining area is clean and brightly decorated and the service is prompt and efficient. Otani would be a perfectly fine choice if you're in the area and looking to fill up quickly on some noodles, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"It is expensive and steamy and is automatically the best ramen restaurant by default, purely because there are not many ramen restaurants in the area.  I had their Tonkatsu, which is a creamy pork broth, noodles, and fixings. Perhaps I am spoiled because I'm from New York, but Otani does not hold a thread in comparison. Their broth lacks a depth of flavor, and their noodles feel a little too lackluster to justify $12 on a bowl of noodles.   Ultimately, what really bothers me about Otani noodles is how steamy the inside of the restaurant is. It really lacks ventilation. The walls are slick with condensation and the floor to ceiling windows are always fogged up. You can see the streaks of grime from where the window cleaner \"missed a spot\" or left residue. Either way, that is really Otani Noodle's biggest problem, because it begs the question of whether or not their chef is dripping, much like the steam collecting on the window, sweat into your noodle soup..."}
{"text":"I love the noodles there. I heard the restaurant was owned by Cantonese, but who cares if the food is delicious. They don't have wifi inside though."}
{"text":"After trying so many ramen places around Ohio, my expectations were as low as could be for this joint. I was expecting another hyped up Asian-fusion joint with an overpriced menu and poorly thought out dishes. I have to say though, Otani exceeded my expectations. The restaurant is quite small, probably only 4-5 tables. The menu is well laid out and there are pictures of each ramen option, which is always a plus. They offer a variety of different broths and flavors, but I ended up choosing the Tonkatsu, which is basically a fried pork cutlet and is served with a white broth derived from the marrow of pork bones (thus giving it that milky white color). My bowl had corn kernels, mushroom, broccoli and green onions, but they have a variety of other add-ons such as a soft boiled egg or fish balls. I found the tonkatsu to be perfect, it wasn't overcooked as pork cutlets often, are and it maintained it's texture even after soaking up the ramen broth. The noodles too had a pretty good texture, not as chewy as hand-pulled noodles, but definitely had some bite to them. The broth I found to be bordering on too salty, but when eaten with the noodles it wasn't noticeable. My friends tried out the Tom Yum option and weren't impressed, I tried it and agreed it was too sour and not well balanced... but hey! It's a ramen joint, not a Thai joint. Overall, we really did enjoy our meal here. I think the price was a little higher than I'm accustomed to paying for a bowl of noodles, but considering this place has virtually no competition (not yet anyways!) it's practically a steal. The service was excellent, this is a fast casual restaurant, but those taking orders and wiping tables and such are very friendly. This wouldn't be my first choice for noodle soups overall, but I would return and recommend given I was in the mood for ramen specifically."}
