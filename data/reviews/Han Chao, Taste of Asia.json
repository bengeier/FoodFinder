{"text":"Love this restaurant!  It is my go-to when I want Asian food. The staff is warm and welcoming and the food is consistently great. If you have not given it a try, do!  We need to keep this little gem in our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great variety of different cuisines decently priced! Every dish is big enough for at least two meals and everything is quite tasty. They have a dedicated waiting area for ordering and takeout which makes it separate from the restaurant creating a great balance for dining in or grabbing food to go. Love the pad thai!"}
{"text":"Done takeout Chinese food here a few times.  Food quality is good, not great.  Maybe too many things on the menu, they can't be great at everything.  On a positive note, they are always quite fast with takeout orders (15 mins or so) and staff seem pleasant."}
