{"text":"Very satisfied with this place. The falaffel was very good and the shwarma was tasty."}
{"text":"Not impressed by their customer service. They charge you tax and won't provide any prove for it. Are they really paying the government or in their pockets for more profit?"}
{"text":"We love their shawarma, especially beef. The spices they use on the meat are exceptionally good and not stingy. 4 stars only because they are often out of the pickled turnips (we take our own) - yet they are so close to suppliers like ARZ. Large and 2 for 1 specials but that's not as important as great taste. The odd time the beef is a tad dry but so what, we just let the sandwich rest for a bit and soak up the sauces.   Is it the best? For us it's on a par with Sharwarma Empire - different pita, and SE uses a to-die-for brown sauce - just different sandwiches but both great. And both are the best we've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've tried this place on more than one occasion because it is close to my parent's place so I figured that if once it wasn't great maybe the next time it would be. There is always a line-up when I pass by and it is open really late so that made me think it must be amazing.  The reason I give it two stars is that every time (3+) my sandwich had really chewy pieces of chicken fat in it. Yes, it is a huge sandwich and also full of toppings but the actual meat part is what I went for and that was not so good. It's actually unappetizing when you bite into something and get chewy bits of fat that shouldn't there (believe it or not).   The price is steeper than most in the area, and there isn't too much seating just about 8-10 places I'd say max. The worker is friendly too. I have passed by the kitchen from the back sometimes they keep the door open in the summer and it isn't the cleanest kitchen I've seen.   Their only plus is that they open late, so when other places around are closed then you know you can get your shawarma here even if there is better out there."}
{"text":"Amazing food! It will leave you satisfied but do be warned these people are the \"SOUP NATZIES\" Seinfeld spoke of. Dont stand out dont ask for anything extra, just walk in walk out. Their racists, bigots, & leer worse than a 12yr old with a playboy but damn that shawarma....makes you droool like Homer Simpson"}
{"text":"The plate they only give one piece of potato. The amount of food and the price of the plate being at 14.99 just sux and does not make sense. And the wrap a little bigger than spring roll doesn't equate to 7 dollars. I got bigger portions at a franchise like villa madina and that shouldn't b the case. Until they change their cheap attitude I m gonna start hitting shawarma empire down the road."}
{"text":"I have eaten up and down the Lawrence strip and across Scarborough. There are places with something going on, and others that do not. In my opinion Ibrahim should be on your list to try in Scarborough. They do what they do well and consistently.   Of course I come for the Schwarma. I get a single sandwich which is enough for me. Its much better than the little ones other restaurants sell 2 for 1. I like this one particularly because of the veggies. Its a much better balanced sandwich than most places. The meats and sauces are fine. The pannini grill makes everything hot. They have outdoor seating when the sun is shining. They have high volume turnover so everything is fresh. The staff are polite although they have to work very hard. Because of the lines it can take a few minutes longer to get your Schwarma, but you know its made fresh for you.   Other than the wait when its busy, there is nothing I dont like about this place. Yes, they make the sandwiches with their hands. But yes they follow the rules about washing and not cross handling things. Its fine.   Got get a schwarma here. Now. $7 very well spent.  Then next time try Nasibs and Schwarma Empire as well. They are all good and have their own special touches. Each one is delightful and deserves your business. Come check them out.  ps Lawrence East is the food mecca. Downtowners must come out here to check it out."}
{"text":"Huge shawarma at a great price. Tables could use more frequent cleaning but overall THE place to get shawarma!"}
{"text":"Been here one time and will never go again.  The chicken shawarma I came to try was still raw in my sandwhich,  I spoke to the cashier and right away she gave me my money back. She made me look like am trying to rip them off. Nothing to appreciate at this restaurant."}
{"text":"The establishment is a hole in the wall with a couple crappy tables.  The places with the best food usually are.  They are the best shwarma and falafel place I've ever been to.  I have moved further away but I would rather drive 15 minutes each way to go there than walk 3 minutes to a local place.  Always a line up, even at 11:00pm"}
{"text":"I work in the area close by so I get shawarma a lot.  I really don't like this place because of the unprofessional staff. (they wear everyday street cloth to serve you food).  I like to watch my weight so I always ask for no sauce.   The first time they messed it up, it was an understandable mistake.  The second time, they made a mistake again, i was a bit annoyed.  This past weekend, I visited the store again because it was on my way to my office.   They messed up my order a third time. The staff was also giving me a lot of attitude.  I walked out of the store, food is okay, but not worth it to suffer from idiot staff who always put sauce on your food when you ask them specifically not to put sauce."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those small little places that make you wonder if the food is good or not.  The first time I ever saw Ibrahim, I was curious and a tad bit skeptical but seeing that I was a 2 minute walk away from it, I figured why not.  Like I said, this place SMALL. Quite often, you will see the store packed (even on a really cold day). Often, you will see TTC buses, fire trucks, ambulances, large trucks and police cars stopping to get food from Ibrahim. It's opened from 11 am (I believe) until late into the evening (I've seen it open at 2 am before). The service is sometimes inconsistent (thus the one star reduction). They have good and friendly customer service, especially if you are a regular customer.   When I first started to go here, you could get 2 shawarma's for under $10 but of course with inflation, prices are bound to go up a bit. You can still get a 2 for a reasonable price but beware, if you are using debit, they will charge extra regardless on how much you are paying.   I definitely recommend getting their lamb shank on rice, if they have it. If not, their chicken shawarma, falafel and mixed shawarma are awesome! If you do want a mixture being chicken and beef, they charge you a bit more but well worth the money. I myself, find that the size of the shawarma is unbeatable in comparison to other places I have had and the flavour is on point.   Just like the store front, they have a tiny parking space that is hard to maneuver around in. I would recommend just parking on the side of the street or just across where the Big Moe's is.   They used to own a meat shop beside their shawarma shop but it became an unused space for many years. It then became a lounge (Dubai Lounge) and it was open for less than a year and it's now closed again. Regardless, even if they use that space or not, I'll continue to come to this place for what I think is one of the best shawarma's I have had!"}
{"text":"Decent shawarma.  $10.99 for 2 shawarma(beef or chicken).  Best thing about this place is it's opened late until(2am or 4am in the summer).  Inside there is only seating for around 10 people.  Outdoor seating is available in the summer(about 20 seats; 10 tables).  Good if you are hungry late night."}
{"text":"Like the shawarma here... fresh ones in the morning hours was really tasty..."}
{"text":"Now it became wrost sawarama places. The new staff is oldy and very rude. I didn't like the sawarama at all and specially now they don't listen to the customers at all. They will give u wat they want not what u want"}
{"text":"Delicious, there's a line out the door for a reason. Don't ask for extra extra hot sauce though."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place over the last four years and there have been notable changes in portion size as well as in their quality of service. From my first visit here I noticed the service was subpar but the late hours have kept me coming back due to sheer convenience. More recently I arrived with a handful of friends, after ordering and topping our meals to our liking we were turned back at the counter due to faults of the establishment's own payment system. We were not given a reasonable alternative but rather left the shop as hungry as we arrived. Having worked in the restaurant industry the lack of interest this establishment has for customer satisfaction is upsetting. I will definitely not recommend this place ever again as their flaw in customer service roots from as high as the management level and possibly even ownership (almost certain I've dealt with the owner.. unpleasant experience)  On a side note I recall reading a review comparing their service to that of the soup nazi (Seinfeld.. YouTube the clip if you're curious, quite a laugh)  .. I did not believe it at the time, but they are arguably worse."}
{"text":"First time this place opened up it was so good. So recently I went late night and I was hungry and didn't feel like pizza. It's open late and all so I try it and it's horrible. It sat in my gut and kept me awake all night. They changed since they first opened up. They give you less meat and the shawarma looks sloppy. Also the customer service is terrible. They always give attitude. Better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I absolutely looooove this place - the quality of the food has been consistently incredible.  They used to have a butcher shop beside - I am not sure if they still do and if they get their meat from there, but whatever they are doing is working.  Reading from some other comments, I personally did not find the staff to be favouring their own nationality - I am a blond, green eyed female, and never felt uncomfortable or mistreated in the 10-12 times that I visited the shop.  During my last visit, about 8-9 people out of 10 were not the same nationality as the owners, and they all enjoyed their repeat visit.  I can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the same as it once was. I've been going here for 7 years, but stopped recently because the meat is just fatty and disgusting. When I first started going, the workers were friendly, the meat was good..but recently, maybe the last 2 years, its been bad and I haven't went back. Its also really dirty. I read on here and I totally agree, Ruby's is a lot better. Clean, friendly and quality meat."}
{"text":"I arrived at 2pm on weekdays and ther was a line up.  You get 2 shawarmas for 8.99. I had the chicken shawarma, and there is a lot more chicken than other places around the area and more flavourful.  The toppings are bit different than what I'm used to.  There is no hummus or pickles.  The bread is nice and toasty.  Portion wise it's filling one is enough to fill you up. Overall I liked the sandwich,  the way it's arranged you get a bit of everything.  The chicken is moist and mixed together with yummy goodness. Writing about it makes me want to grab one now. Oh and you like Arizona they have tons of flavours there."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sharwarma spots! Highly recommend the chicken sharwarma!"}
{"text":"Im surprised this place has such a good overall rating. I must say I'll never understand the constant crowd. I grew up on Wayne and have tried eating here out of curiosity. There are several reasons why I think this is the grossest shawarma I have ever had!!!   1. Yes its a big sandwich..and full. Full of crap that is! Chunks of fat and greasy chicken pieces which happen to be the cheaper chicken cuts. REAL shawarma is made out of breast meat and this is far from it!   2. Next, if you walk by often enough, you will often get a glimpse of their filthy kitchen in the back when the door is open. You'll see the lack of cleanliness and sometimes even a lack of hygiene in the form of sweaty fore heads.   3. Also, workers don't wear gloves or hairnets.  4. Their service is sub-par at best.   5. They have minimal seating...  Bonus Reason : My friend also had food poisoning here. Just don't eat here!!!!  The only 2 reasons I can think of to explain why he's still in business. He opens late and serves very large Shawarmas...  If you want a clean good tasting shawarma try Ruby's in Eglinton square mall. Pure lean chicken breast meat...very clean, tasty and friendly service. Tastes similar to the real deal that I get back home in Lebanon."}
{"text":"My first visit to this place would have had me walking out with a 5 star review! I had their Shawarma plate, and the amount of food that came with it was worth the price. Now what really had me pleased was the meat itself. It wasn't like other shawarma places, it had it's own distinct recipe as well as the edges of the chicken were nice and crispy....it was HEAVEN in my mouth.   The meat was so good, I was craving it all week, and decided to go again the week after. Instead of getting the plate, I just wanted the meat, and grabbed it for $30/ KG. Which I found later to be a rip off. Now he had two racks of chicken going and I noticed that he gave the other customers that ate the wraps/plates off of one rack, and when I asked for the meat he gave it off a separate rack. I took it home and realized this wasn't the same chicken I had the week before, well it was, just wasn't cooked to perfection like the other rack he gave the other customers. The spices were still not cooked but I ate it anyway with my family.  Next day, everyone that ate it had diarrhea. He gave us the rack that wasn't fully cooked and tasted nothing like what I had the week before. WHY? I had paid just for the meat and he gave me the bad rack. If I had ordered 3 plates which would have come with the potatoes/rice/salad I would have paid an extra $5 and got the good meat. I paid more and got the bad meat. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is good but the employees will NEVER wash their hands. Always a young guy at night who smokes cigarettes, touches money, hangs outside touching decor, and then he proceeds to prep YOUR food with NO gloves or washing his hands. I would eat here all the time if it wasn't for staff. One time i went there I told the guy to wash his hands so he proceeded to walk towards the sink, he then got spotted by the older gentleman (assuming the manager/owner) and he was told NOT TO WASTE TIME. If you want to play with your hygiene then by all means Ibrahims BBQ is the place for you.   P.S- This is supposed to be HALAL yet they do not wash their hands. Disgraceful  *****THEY HAVE FIXED THIS ISSUE! Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken shawarma I've had in Toronto so far. I have never really liked the shawarma in Toronto (Ali Baba's, Paramount, Pita Way etc.) but I loved the sandwich at Ibrahim. Originally I was meaning to try Farhat across the street, but it was closed for renovations. Ibrahim had a line-up the whole time I was there. I have been told the food wasn't good at one point, but that they have improved a lot."}
{"text":"I was tipped off about this place by a friend. They werent kidding. The shawarma was incredibly good. The service was very fast and friendly too. There are many options for shawarma in the Wexford neighbourhood, and I havent tried any of the other ones but I don't need to, because Ibrahim is awesome."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite shawarma place. Huge servings and their 2 for 1 shawarma deal is amazing, i always had the 1 chicken 1 beef shawarma in the middle of the night (taxis line up here in the evening as the food is really good) on late nights and really starving situation, their shawarma platter will fix you up for sure!! I live just around the corner so i am a regular here, at least 2x a week"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. Places I've also been to quite a few times include: Sarah's shawarma (bloor and spadina), Pita-Q (bloor and spadina), Shawarma Empire (down the street), Nasib's (down the street near Empire), Al-tanoor (down the street), Taste of Beirut (across the street), Pitaland (morningside and kingston, ajax, and downtown near ryerson), Ali Baba (a few of their locations), Farhat (down the street). I'm sure there are many more but those are the ones I remember right now.   What I'm saying is I know what a good Shawarma is and I love them!  Ibrahim's was in the top 3 for a while (maybe even #1 in the city), but over the last 3-6 month's they have both increased their prices ($10 for 2 vs. the old $9 for 2) and decreased the quantities of meat they give you (Unless you are of course Arab, which I am not). I still think they are solid but the price and quantities were a BIG selling point (as well as the fact that they are open till 3 or 4 in the morning). I used to tell my buddies we were going to eat bricks (due to the size and weight) when I was introducing this place but this is definitely not the case any more! Both the price increase and the decreased quality (less meat) are likely a result of their increased popularity but given their lack of consistency I'd tell people to try out Empire (close by) instead as they are always consistent and are better priced and taste amazing (they close early though). Both Nasib's and Al-tanoor are also solid and will now fill you up better than Ibrahim's for the price (I never thought I'd make that sort of statement).  Overall still decent (esp. if you're Arab ;-) ) but not the same place I used to love."}
{"text":"How is it people aren't giving this place 5 stars?! This has to be the best Shawarma I have ever had, and the 2 for 1 deal is awesome! Even their falafel is tasty!   Yes the lineups are long but it is so worth the wait. Haven't encounted bad service here yet. It's a small place so I don't expect to be served epic fast esp if you want your food prepared right.  Def would drive the distance anywhere to come here! I am drooling writing this lol."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the shawarma here! Service here is fairly quick and the people working here are also very nice. I'm happy I got introduced to this place because I would have never noticed it by myself."}
{"text":"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE TO HAVE SHAWARMA! Leaving the customer hanging to talk to friends, unhygienic meat distribution, no use of gloves, or sanitary equipments.   Also you don't get the amount of meat that you actually pay for! And on top they have a basket full of ATTITUDE!  My family and I have been there many times in the last 4 years but after yesterday's service, never again. I don't want anyone getting sick. Money is not everything.  It's the service and quality of food that matters!"}
{"text":"There's a line-up today; a half-dozen people ahead of me so it took 10 minutes before I was able to place my order.  I decided on the special of two chicken shawarmas for $11.99; total tax in is $13.55.  My order was quickly prepared by a young man who looked like he wanted to be elsewhere and I paid cash to avoid a credit-debit surcharge.  The male owner handed me my change and my meal...no thank you or hint of acknowledgement for the business; 1 star.  No napkins in the bag either.  Each bite of my shawarma was delicious and balanced in flavours; I'm not a spice person but it was good.  Five stars here.  Seating is available inside but I chose outdoors today under a tent.  Parking is available on the side of the building.  Many customers picking up food and dashing.  I told a lady cleaning the tables it was my first time here and I liked it.  She smiled and said you're welcome!  Now that's more like it!!"}
{"text":"I'd been going to this place for years now with my bf. The service has gone down a lot & the quality wavers. I went last week begrudgingly because my bf really wanted something quick, relatively healthy, cheap & we were in the area. In our last experience, after toasting 2 shawarmas, the older guy checking us out washed his hands, didn't dry them & packed our toasty shawarmas with dripping wet hands - what was the point of toasting them? Immediately the pita bread started to rip - why wrap the shawarma with the pita then if I'm supposed to eat a ripping, loose 'salad'? The staff didn't seem to care about having torn the bread down the middle & just packed it to go. We won't be visiting this location in the future. Our experiences have been from wrong orders, rudeness & arrogance (especially when I used to visit alone as a woman) to no cleanliness standards (don't wear gloves)."}
{"text":"I've been going here since it first opened up. It's not under the same management as it once was..which usually goes downhill. They've became very cheap and increased their prices (which is fine) but don't skimp out on your meat!  Sometimes they make it good, and sometimes it's pretty bad. (Over stuffed with vegetables and barely any meat)"}
{"text":"Best place in Scarborough. Long lineups, good prices, lots of quantity, and most importantly it tastes great"}
{"text":"Came here on Thanksgiving Monday. the two nearby shwarma places were closed because of the holiday. Which is what I'm going to say accounted for the super long line up. It couldn't possibly have been because of the food. Or the employees/service.  I walked in and there was at least 5-8 people ahead of me. I mentally prepared for slow service. Before I even got to order, I saw several people be told that what they wanted (whole chicken, falefals, potatoes, etc) was not available today/anymore. This place is generally open until 2am... before 7pm they have run out of several items or simply did not have them at all that day.  Literally before I go to order, the man who was making all the shwarma sandwiches/servicing the dinner entrees throws a fit. Facing the customers, he starts yelling to the kitchen staff. I'm still not sure what happened, but it seems people were not sure what their tasks were. He yelled something along the lines of if you want me to be in the kitchen, get out of the kitchen/if you're in the kitchen, stay in the kitchen. So he storms off, throwing things about. Eventually he goes into the kitchen and some other dude comes to make the sandwiches I'm ordering.  He barely listens to what I say (I have four sandwiches and not everyone wants everything). He sloppily wraps the sandwiches. I pay, grab the food, and leave.  It's about 5 min drive to my place and as my family eats their sandwiches, we, despite our hunger, decide never to return. It doesn't even taste that good. It's definitely not worth a second chance after the first experience. The worst part of the dismal service is that not a single customer was complaining about the lack of food or the wait or the tantrum. If you're going to be slow, at least make the food properly!"}
{"text":"The best Shawarma I have had. Staff is really nice and fair. I said I don't want rice and potato and they give me extra chicken and all 3 types of Salad! really impressed with their food and their manners."}
{"text":"Hahahaha.. I can't believe this place doesn't have a straight five star rating. They never run out of anything. There is a reason why there's always a line up out the door for this place when there are probably about two dozen Shwarma shops up and down Lawrence that you could probably walk to .Hahaha..people are going to hate I guess. I hope these guys stay in business for ever, everyone know the spicy green sauce they make (Must be a family recipe) and the way they do both beef and chicken so good consistently. the meat is good every. time. I am convinced its cause they sell it so fast its impossible for it to ever get dry or old.  But just be prepared. those 5,6,7 people in line  in font of you aren't just ordering a single plate or sandwich. They are probably ordering for 5,6,7 other people.Despite the insane amount of people that are always ordering food the people who work there are always super nice and friendly. and its so worth it and hey sometimes you get lucky and you're in and out in a few minutes. I wouldn't have them change a thing."}
{"text":"Reasonable pricing for Shawarmas in Scarborough.  Provides a 2 for 1 deal at $11.99 or Single shawarma for $6.99.  Open late during the summers for cravings. Service is always great and the staff is friendly.   In terms of taste, the shawarmas are average and the chicken (my personal favourite) can sometimes come out burnt. However, that's not always the case. I wouldn't say I'd never go here again, but it's just the most convenient for when you want a shawarma."}
{"text":"pretty juicy flavourful sharma  the meat tasted seasoned which makes it taste different from other run of the mill sharma places  the place gets busy which is explained by the good food."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town for real. Yeah customer service might suck and dining too. But im a huge shawarma lover and its delish every time. Always satisfied eith my chicken shawarma. The place is alwayyys busy but is best as a take out place. Just remember that the quality of food isnt compromised bc of their customer service"}
{"text":"Bogus tastless shawarma. Felt nauseated  after having it .Unprofessional staff. Dont reccomend this place as they are rip offs. Much better tasting joints nearby"}
{"text":"This place triggers Ahmad's song \"back in the day\" in my head. Back in the day, they used to give two shawarma's for a fair price. Back in the day, the chicken used to be good. Back in the day I'd come at night for a bite here. If you don't get my riff, point is, now, this place is garbage. I give em a solid one star.  I went here last night after a long time. I had barely eaten all day, and just came from downtown looking for something open late. When you're that hungry it is hard to be disappointed, yet I was.   I had two chicken shawarma's ($12) plus a Coconut drink (Grace brand - $3...this is $1 at No Frills lol). The shawarma was really crap. The chicken looked good on the spit as one person mentioned, but the meat was hard and not really chewable. The size was okay, but stuffed with a lot of vegetables (vegetables okay). Sauces were nothing special. The value of two shawarma's is $6 at best, the quality is just so not good. The thing that annoyed me was the Coconut drink was three times the retail price, not to mention $0.50 for using debit. Seriously?   Oh, they also don't use gloves when making the wraps. Gross.   This place capitalizes on the fact they are one of the few places open late on Lawrence. I think Mickey D's woulda hit the spot better. I don't know of any other places open late for shawarma in Scarborough but you're better off taking a drive and going to Yonge Street for a bite this late."}
{"text":"I usually try to avoid giving bad reviews. But this time I had to give a bad/honest review to help the next person from their food. WOW!! The worst shawarma I have ever had!! And that says a lot because I have tried almost every location within North America and some other foreign countries. Taste: 0 Quality of food: 0 and anything else u can think of food wise: 0. The only thing was that the staff was friendly but that still didn't cover the bad food experience!!"}
{"text":"I've tried the beef and chicken shawarma wraps and their fries. Food was amazing and workers are so nice! Ibrahim's is definitely one of the best shawarma stops in the area and they're open late too. :)"}
{"text":"I work and live in the area.  I've eaten at this place hundreds of times and introduced it to many many people.  THIS IS THE BEST SHAWARMA I HAVE EVER HAD.  Even on it's worst day it's better than any shawarma i've had in the city. and I've tried many different places.  Even with a massive lineup the service is quick and the staff is really cool and friendly.  I've tried some of the other items including the dinners and they are also very tasty.  I highly recommend the Lamb Shank.   It's DELICIOUS.   The high turnover means that everything is very VERY fresh.  The hot sauce has a nice flavour and isn't just heat.   I can eat this everyday without getting bored of it.   Even if you don't live in Scarborough this is so good that it's actually worth going to specifically just to eat HERE!       I also love that it's open very late."}
{"text":"First time I went, I was blown away I could still get a giant shawarma for a fair price, let alone two of them for their 6.99 combo. Chicken is very moist but the beef as tasty as it is can be dry sometimes. I suggested that they could add a lamb spit as I feel the people at Ibrahim Pizza & bbq could pull off an excellent mutton shawarma.   Overall, do go there for their shawarma combo in whatever animal you like, it will satiate your taste buds & gluttony."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service - very rude service professionals. I paid $15 for a shawarma plate which is but above price range according to scarborough shawarma standards. I requested for a pita bread along with shawarma plate but the service professionals were so bad and they started advising me on i should be paying for it separately etc for about 2 minutes length., I have never seen such rude shawarma store ever in toronto...[ the only advantage of this store is its open till late]... Also no sense of cleanliness by the servicemen at the counter..."}
{"text":"Most overrated place in Scarborough. Worst service and the most average tasting shawarma. Meet quantity terrible and the staff are usually fighting and in cranky mood. Only nice to regular customers or their friends."}
{"text":"I'd rather eat road kill. Why you ask. Let me start:  1) Their customer service is crap.  2) Cleanliness is questionable. Work area is not tidy and the cashier grabbed the sandwiches with her bare hands, after using the cash register.  3) Their employees are rude.  4) The chicken was not good. Looks great on the spit, but it had the texture of prechewed food. Hard, burnt chunks and mushy chicken. Garlic sauce barely had a hint of garlic.  5) Did I mention how rude they are there? They are. Get off your high horse and remember you're charging $7 a sandwich for garbage.  6) They're stingy. With everything.  7) They only take debit or cash. And they charge you $0.50 for using debit. I'm not a fan of \"you gotta pay cash\" places.   Keep on driving folks, there are plenty of shawarma places around town, and this isn't one worth trying."}
{"text":"As others have commented, the shawarmas here contain some fatty parts. However, I don't find this a bad thing as some fatty chicken is pretty delicious. These parts are also lower cost than lean cuts thus a much larger product can be afforded for the typical shawarma price. They also open late for those owl cravings. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Used to be really good, but then they started giving people mostly old and leftover meat stored in the oven. The people behind the counter don't understand a word of English and don't use any gloves to handle the food. They often confuse orders and give you someone else's food. Friends and I got food poisoning from our last visit. We are NOT going back."}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma with the veggies and sauces is good.  Good size too, but maybe a bit too much on the veggie side. Sign outside says \"2 for 1\" but I think they mean two shawarmas for one price....not two for the price of one.  Anyway......we've been there a few times over the past year only because their shawarma tasted so good.....but not so much lately.  Why? Because they need to be more consistent with the use of gloves and hairnets....man, what a turn off when places don't use these simple and inexpensive hygienic materials when preparing food. The place needs to be cleaned up too.  They need to clean up behind the counter. The deep fryer looks gross, the grease filters look like they have never been cleaned...etc.   Clean it up, wear your protective gear and we'll come back."}
{"text":"I had never tried a shawarma in my 21 years of living before this. I'm happy that my first experience with the shawarma was here! I had a falafel one and it was very yummy. They are very quick when making the shawarmas and the quality was very good. I only wish they would have added a little more falafel in the shawarma. For chicken and beef, they give a good portion. Indoor seating isn't appealing because it's really warm in the restaurant, but the outdoor seating is under a tent. The only thing is, in the evening, there aren't any outdoor lights. But overall this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"!! SMALL QUANTAITY FOR MIX PLATE !!low quality meat !!!16:95 expensive for a plate !!food smell old !! Worst experience !!Rip off and dont go there"}
{"text":"Tough review to write. I used to go 2009-2014 but haven't been since 2015 because of some of the issues mentioned by other reviewers.   I want to love Ibrahim - open late, fairly priced for a big Shawarma sandwich, I thought the meat was great while I was going there, for me the ideal cooking time and great seasoning - in particular I loved the way the scent of Cloves permiates the Beef. Side dishes were par for the course in this segment.   But I got upset stomach the last couple of times and can't help but be concerned about the questionable food handling and kitchen keeping that can be seen in the restaurant. Same guy taking cash and handling bread without gloves, open food containers on the floor with no lids, no gloves on kitchen staff (side door often open so you can see it all from the parking lot...). Sadly I can't recommend it anymore and will need to see a more professional set up before I consider revisiting."}
{"text":"whenever I m in the area, I order their beef shawarma. wrap.. its tasty and very cheap compared to others.. and the amount of food is also unbelievable...   I still haven't tried a better shawarma anywhere else.."}
{"text":"This place serves the best shawarma sandwiches in town.  Well worth the drive to Lawrence East in Scarborough.   The toppings are always fresh, the green paste hot sauce kicks, and the beef is the way to go in my opinion.   Strong selection of authentic beverages including mango and guava juices, and kefir.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They usually carry a 2 for 1 offer on shawarmas. And they are pretty good sized shawarmas. 2 will fill you up anyday anytime.  There's a couple of tiny tables to sit around inside the restaurant, but it's a little cramped in there. I think they extend the seating to outside the restaurant during warm weather."}
{"text":"I've given them enough chances. Expensive, RUDE, and severely inconsistent food quality and portions. I usually don't expect amazing customer service at places like this so I don't care, but this is over the top!!!  I order 1 chicken 1 beef, he starts making them and goes \"don't worry boss I make good for you\" I look away for ONE SECOND, he starts putting chicken in the second one, I say \"it's 1 chicken 1 beef\" he rolls his eyes at me with lots of attitude and goes \"ok I make mixed for you!\" Starts putting beef in with the chicken , and goes \"we charge 2$ extra but I do favour for you, so remember!\" I never asked you to make me mixed in the first place!   NEVER GOING AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best shawarma in town. The 2-for-1 deal is hard to beat too. $6.99 for 2 mammoth huge shawarma's (even bigger if you befriend the evening guy).   The chicken shawarma is best. the beef is good when's its good, but is quite inconsistent (as i find is the case in most places) since it gets easily dry.  remember to ask for pickles (if you like 'em - i do!) as they don't put them in by default.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu (why?) but they do have lots of other stuff like bbq chicken, vegetarian dishes, and much more.  there's only a few tables and the place is always busy. Generally you can get a table but its kindof more of a takeout joint. there's also an adjoining grocery (which i haven't checked out)."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now for the chicken shawarma, and I can definitely say with confidence, that the shawarma meat is amazing! It's so soft and tender, and full of flavour. The only gripe I have is that they fold it over the wrap once into a halfmoon shape rather than a tight wrap so it opens pretty easily, especially if you get all the sauces. Other than the fact, that it can get a bit messy, the flavour is amazing and the sandwich it self is so jam packed it's incredibly filling, I'll definitely be coming back for it."}
{"text":"Best place to get shawarmas in Toronto. By far. Great place! Been going here for years. There's usually a line, but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Nice clean place, recent renovation with updated TV menu's are a nice touch. Late night business hours which is a nice plus. Cash / Debit only.   Chicken Shawarma Plate.  - I normally get the wraps, but tried the plate for a change.  - $11.99 reasonable price for what you get  - All your typical shawarma veggies, chicken, rice, sauce, and potatoes. Which is something new to me.   - As usual place is not skimpy, you get a healthy portion   For some weird reason, it just didn't work for me it was a-okay. Found the meat to be over marinated and a bit salty. With the ingredients separated was over powering. Sauce was just poured on top of everything. With all the flavors and ingredients separated on every bite, it just didn't have the right taste compared to when you get it wrapped in a pita. Got to be fair, normally the chicken shawarma wrapped is one of the best in the area, guess that's how its meant to be eaten.     Conclusion, place is great, food is great, staff is great, just avoid the plate get the pita instead. Despite this would still go again."}
{"text":"I wanna give it four stars because of the food but I can't. I always order the mix plate spicy with extra tahini (crack) sauce. Love the potatoes coz they are soaked in gravy and asked them to put some on your rice. The meats are tender and the portions are enormous I swear it weighs about five pounds. Now the reason why I didn't give it four stars are customer service. The one serving the talking too much instead of concentrating on the order. And I only go there when it's winter. I went there summer time and there were flies everywhere. Also because the parking area u can see the garbage and see the back door of the restaurant wide open. But people love this place."}
{"text":"Good shwarams here.  Its huge, and its stuff with toppings.  A little more expensive than the other 2 for 1 shwarma deals nearby.  But it makes up with size and toppings.  Price has gone up a bit, its now 7.99 for 2 or 4.29 for one, but its worth it, cause the size is huge.  I would say one is as large as 2 from one of their competitors.  This is my go to shwarma place in the warden/lawrence area."}
{"text":"this place sucks. not halal..if it was they'd be cleaner and more respectable to their customers. this is not a good place to eat. it's not even 2 for 1 anymore calculate the price...it's trash..I notice these drinks that cost 1 dollar now they're almost double. this is not a 4 or 3 stars place..it's 1 and half if you ask me. beef is trash only thing is chicken. Johnny shawarma for the win!!! now johnnys yall need to go. everything is great there."}
{"text":"The 2 stars I am giving are for the TASTE of the shawarma wrap and plates. Up until summer of 2015 they use to give amazing generous portions and great price of 2 for 7.99 which went to 8.99 then 9.99 then 10.99 and I think it's 11.99 now probably since I've refused to go in the last 9 months. The portions are considerably skimped out now with more vegetables and barely any meat. Me, my mom, and dad use to drive 60-70 KM's (40mins -1hr) just to buy 6-8 at a time for the week. Since the very quick shot up in price and receding amount of ingredients in our wraps we no longer go there and have found some where closer. I was there 4/7 days of every week and trust me I know the difference going that often. It's great for once or twice but as a student it's a rip off when you see just 2 minutes down there's a 2 for $8 available. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food ok but the long wait is terrible unless you have 2hrs lunch plus sometimes no seats the ask you to sit outside the don't care about the weather it's raining or sunny."}
{"text":"The reviews claiming this place never runs out of anything are wrong. Despite having four menu items that include falafel, they have consistently not made it available since the new year. My bf and I frequented this place very often and they have always been happy to accommodate vegetarians diets in the past, but the last five visits they've offered the same explanation: \"sorry, not today. We usually do, come back tomorrow!\" We figured maybe it was late and sold out and to come back earlier but it seems they just can't be bothered to make some of the menu items if it slows down the line, regardless of the time of day. Not a fan of the prices doubling either. Two shawarma sandwiches for 10.99 is ludicrous for a shawarma joint in Scarborough. The sandwiches are pretty good and the salad filling options are consistently fresh, but they buy all their pitas and veggies from Arz across the street, where the prices haven't changed at all. Getting arrogant about your product and service is the best way to steer away loyal customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service the young guy that works there is ignorant and rude. If they want more customers or avoid losing customers they need to get rid of him."}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've ever had. There are better times to go. Seems like earlier in the day they have fresher veggies, their green hot sauce is more vibrant in colour and spicier. Nonetheless you can't go wrong. They kill it. Although I do dig their rival (Empire) down the street, I find myself returning to Ib's more often than not. Because it's delicious."}
{"text":"Yes it's good food but  they are charging for the drinks double then the other places charge! It's almost same price of the shawarma wrap.  Ask them how much is the ayran or airan a drink made of yogurt and water."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for over 5yrs. Yesterday was our last time. On Thurs Oct 20th @ 11pm, we ordered two shawarma plates that were now way smaller in portion. It was obvious that the kid was miserable and didn't want to be there. I asked for extra garlic and he was out. He didn't want to get anymore from the kitchen, which he had to anyway, since there was a line up of costumers. Don't put these kids on the line, only to treat your loyal customers like ****. They don't care about the business. The older guys are better."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  A friend recommended this place and the first time we went, it was great and the gentleman that served us was lovely. He assembled the Shawarma wraps and asked us what we liked and how spicy we wanted them. The second time, I brought another friend and it was awful.  The server we had this time was extremely rude and refused to adjust the level of sauce for the spice level.  He adjusted orders for other customers but not us.  What was that about.  He was rude and stared at my friend with a glare as he prepared the wrap.  I would have walked out but my friend did not want to cause a scene.    What disgusting behaviour.  I followed up with them to try and resolve it.  I received no response.  We won't be back and recommend to others to avoid this place since they don't care."}
{"text":"I came back after 3 years and the quality has gone down substantially. The shawarma was flavorless and the bread was soggy to the point where I stopped eating it as a sandwich and had to pick out the meat. Super sad because this place used to be delicious."}
{"text":"Great fast food shawarma restaurant. 2 for 1 is great for my husband and I. Sometimes even too much for me to finish! But we love it. Always busy so you know it's good :D"}
{"text":"Shawarmas are delicious. Service is just ok. I had to pay with debit and the young guy didn't tell me there is a $.50 surcharge he just bypassed all the options on the machine. I noticed this and asked for a receipt and he gave me another receipt without the $.50 surcharge. Not cool"}
{"text":"Shawarma is good and portion u is pretty big. Their sign is a little deceiving.  It looks like it sat 2 for 1 shawarmas for 4.99 but when u go in its 8.99 for 2."}
{"text":"I would have not found this place on my own, my friend brought me here one night when we felt like something other than a fast food drive-thur. I have only had a shawrama a few times before and I wasn't a fan but decided to try it out again because my friends were talking to highly of this place. I am super glad I listened to them because this Chicken shawrama was out of this world. Hands down very satisfying and makes you crave it over and over again. I ordered mine with the spicy sauce and all the fixings it comes with. They stuffed the wrap with a lot of product but did in such a way to not destroy the wrap.  The only thing I wish this place would have had was sit down seating. I thought I was going to make a mess in my friends car. Lucky I know how to eat properly and didn't. It was a little awkward I'm not going to lie. Other than that... this place is truly a hidden gem in the city. Definitely try is out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and bigger than most shawarma. Mine fell apart and a big rush came in after; they tossed it in another pita and sent me on my merry way. $12 with tax for chicken and beef mixed I think and made me feel world's better after feeling gross for a week. I was very full after!"}
{"text":"Get a Shwarma! It is off the HOOK! Service is very friendly, quick, and the price is excellent. They hooked me up with double meat. How can I say anything bad about this place? Any shwarma place that hooks you up with double meat deserves 5 stars! Am I right, folks? Am I right?"}
