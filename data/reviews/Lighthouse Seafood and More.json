{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Not sure how they are even open because when we went there at dinner time, no one else was there. We should have ran out the door when we had the chance. Fish was dry and was clearly frozen. No flavor, rubber shrimp, gave me tilapia instead of flounder (thought I wouldnt no the difference). The owner was incredibly rude, came to the table rolling their eyes giving us attitude. I will never go back here and everyone else should save yourself and STAY AWAY."}

{"text":"I really don't enjoy doing this, because I believe in supporting family-owned businesses, but I have given this place too many chances.

I first came here a few weeks after grand opening.  Food was good then, nice Southern style fixins, 100x better than the previous tenants' product.

I was so excited, I came back right away with family.  And the experience was the exact opposite.  No one liked the food, the service staff was annoying, not helpful.  I spent the whole time apologizing for this place, explaining how it was so much better just a few days before.

I took a long break after that.  No matter how desperate Huntersville is for this type of establishment, I am not interested in wasting my money.  So we come to their first anniversary of being open, and I try them again.  I was hoping it was better than I remembered.  Boy was I wrong.

When ordering my drink, I was asked if I wanted hushpuppies.  I said \"Why, are they free?\", and the waitress laughed at me and replied, \"Haven't you been here before?!\"   and walked away.  I ordered the founder and shrimp dinner, with macaroni and cheese.  The flounder came out burnt smelling and tasting, dry and gross.  The shrimp was clearly frozen, and was so chewy I gagged on it.  They even messed up the Mac and cheese, using thick pasty cream that tasted nothing like cheese, and superglued my mouth shut.

My waitress made a few other smart remarks throughout my meal, but I was just in a hurry to leave.  I didn't finish the disgusting food, and would not recommend visiting this place, even if just to support a locally owned restaurant."}
