{"text":"This is definitely not a sit down restaurant it is more in the style of a delivery/take out place. That being said the food here is delicious! Its made with great quality ingredients and the employees always make you feel really welcomed when you pick up your order. I usually get the veggie and tofu pad thai it is flavourful and tastes very authentic in comparison to other pad thai's i have tried in the city."}
{"text":"I didn't like my chicken pad Thai. The ingredients did not taste fresh at all. I didn't like the calamari. The flour they used to fry them tasted old. Finally, 75% of the mango in the mango salad was not ripe and the dressing was not well-balanced. I threw everything out of my take out except the spring rolls which always makes me really sad. I don't recall ever having to do that for take out."}
{"text":"Hands down best thai food I've had outside of Thailand (and right up there with food FROM thailand). And I've eaten at quite a few in the GTA. All of the curries - great, pad thai - great, cashew nut - great, mango salad - great, holy basil - great. Can't go wrong at this place and the owners are super friendly and don't cut any corners. Don't go for the decor or the atmosphere it's a small place and is more suited for take out, ultimately it's the food we want. MUST TRY GOGOGO"}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit several fine restaurants in Toronto over Labor Day weekend this year. One of them was Ranu Thai Cuisine just 3 blocks West of the Humber College Campus in the Etobicoke neighborhood on Lake Shore Blvd.  They serve mostly takeout but there are 10 seats in the restaurant where patrons can wait for their order or grab a quick meal.    I started with my favorite Thai dish, Tom Yum Soup with chicken this time. I normally have had Tom Yum served with canned straw mushrooms, but this soup was served with grocery button mushrooms, that added to the freshness and lightness of this traditional Thai Soup. I had the soup with some grilled Lao sausages. Two thumbs up here.  I have had some very traditional Papaya Salad in my time and asked for this dish to be prepared spicier than most Americans would like. Again ingredients were fresh and they used real chopped peppers, not the dried pepper flakes you sometimes see used. It was delicious and used just the right amount of Asian fish sauce - not too strong, just salty enough. It was unapologetically hot and I loved it.  The next dish was Beef Massaman Curry. This is a good \"training curry\" for people new to curry dishes as it has a lower level of spiciness compared to that of Green, or Panang Curry (which are also on the menu). It was sweet rather than spicy. I did have to cut larger pieces of potato into smaller pieces, but this dish was appropriately meaty and savory.  Last but certainly not least I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai, a staple dish of most Thai restaurants. If you can't make a decent Pad Thai, well then... The noodles were firm and not soggy - tough to do in a takeout environment, where the food continues to cook a little in the container before you get it home. It was served with lime on the side (important). They also asked me before putting chopped peanuts on the side as well. I asked for some chili powder which was also provided. Solid dish that should go over well with the local students I would think."}
{"text":"My new favourite Thai place!   I'm in love with their Penang curried fish - my only quibble is that I prefer it served with a whole fried fish (bones, skin and head included!) they serve it with de-boned fish fillets. The sauce though, is awesome - complex & flavourful - and even better if you order it spicy!  Their crispy wrapped shrimp are yummy! So is their mango salad, chicken satay and green curry. I've ordered multiple times and the food is always consistent - I so appreciate that."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've found in west Toronto - and easily the nicest owner of a restaurant I've ever met. He seems super friendly and happy, the type of person that brightens your day when you go in.  I stick to Chicken Pad Thai, which is delicious. Tried the thai spicy noodle, which admittedly I've never had anywhere, but prefer the pad thai. Owner mentioned that the lunch (7.99) is about 66% of the food as the dinner ($8.99) but has spring roll & salad - both are great prices. The salad is very good - you can tell it's fresh.   It reminds me of what a subway sandwiches would be like in thailand, you can see all the cooking and preparation.   Very glad to have wandered in after grabbing coffee nearby, and am a regular customer now!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite thai spot! Food was excellent and it was well priced. I had the pad thai and several coconut curries and every single item was perfection. There arent many spots to sit - it's definitely geared towards take out. I fully recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise, final get good Thai in this neighbourhood. Loved the curry and stir fry veg!   Reasonable prices and good quality.   J"}
{"text":"I walk by this place for the past few years but I did not see much of customer inside but I gave it a try.  Once I went inside, I knew that this place is mostly for take-out because there is probably one tables.  I have been trying my favourite pad thai several places for the past four years in Etobicoke and I believe that this place is best thai food in this neighbourhood!  I LOVE the thai chilly with the pad thai and spring rolls so far and it is reasonable. I cannot wait to try other dishes.    If you live in this area, you must try!"}
{"text":"Great  fast service. Fresh, autentic, delicious food. Very afordable. I always go there. more of a pick up spot than a place to sit and eat but there are tables."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this place is in my neighbourhood. It's quickly become one of my favourite places to eat.  Some of the best Thai curries I have had. I encourage you to move away from the regular, often eaten dishes and try something like the Massamun Curry (the best I've had since being in Thailand) or the house speciality Kabocha Squash Curry. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Saw the review for this place and wanted to give it a try. Yes the portions are large but the food was just ok. The rice was soggy and the pad thai was bland. The chicken curry was the only dish I liked but it wasn't amazing. It was decent. Very little chicken or meat in both my chicken pineapple rice and chicken pad thai. I would prefer less quantity for better flavour. I wish I had a better review."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place almost daily and have always been curious. Thanks to some of the other reviews on here, I convinced my husband (with his rubber arm) to enjoy a late meal with me after a long day. We lucked out because the only table available in this charming, predominantly for take-out, restaurant was free. What a treat! So The place is well liked, for obvious reasons. The owner is a very accommodating and friendly individual. We were greeted very warmly. It isn't a fancy place - it is very to the point - get your food, and enjoy it. We ordered three dishes to sample.  Pad Thai - again, what a treat. The portion was very generous and it was very well prepared. The flavours were simple and complementary and the dish was perfectly seasoned. The Green Curry was fantastic, again perfectly flavoured. The veggies were fresh and tasty and cooked to perfection. The sauce was amazing, it has an awesome kick to it and was musical in your mouth.  Chicken Larb - Wow, - if you can handle some spice, I recommend you try this dish. It comes with the coconut steamed sticky rice - which we politely fought over - who gets more. This was heavy on the dried chilies and will kill and clear any sinus issue you may have at the moment. It is an excellent immune booster. :)   We are definitely come back - perhaps only for take-out, as their one table  for four may be occupied and whatever the circumstance, it will be a treat."}
{"text":"You will not be able to find a place with as much value as here, no matter how hard you try.  Portions are absolutely huge! I was able to eat until I was full there, and still had enough leftovers for two more meals the next day! I am a Pad Thai lover and I can honestly say that this was some of the best I have ever had.   The restaurant only has one small table, so it is more ideal for takeout.  They also do delivery. The food was so great it makes me wish I lived within their delivery zone!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Fresh ingredients. Fast service. I love the red curry, and the coconut soup is delicious. My wife loves the mango salad. Price is perfect. Only thing is there is not really any seating. Takeout or delivery are your best options."}
{"text":"Decisions, decisions....  Two options [only]: Flimsy ikea patio table & chair combination against the wall, or the unstable bar seats with 8\" x 11\" bar table overlooking the kitchen?    There's nothing to see here, no cute chef making your meal, no decor, no people-watch, in-fact no people.  I can see why others call this hole-in-the-wall, and why the restaurant labels itself as convenient Thai meals to go.  We had nowhere to go, so we chose the tall wobbly bar seats as the chef prepared our Pad Thai Omelette {still a rarity in T.O, why?}, Mango Salad {meh}, and a tasty mild-spiced Panang Curry Chicken.    All the prices are in-line with the norm franchise Thai stall at the malls, except those malls don't typically have Thai cooks.  From a local Thai take-out/delivery standpoint, it's THE place to order.  It's a small enough hole, where if you go to the restaurant you have a chance for conversation with the person making your meal, talk Thai and possibly ask for specific dishes in the future.  I wonder if they can really make that all important Custard Sticky Rice, if I pre-order next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the basil chicken lunch special that was only $7.99 which is a great price! It was very tasteful! It came with chicken with mixed veggies, a salad and a spring roll. I also ordered the crispy calamari, which was very delicious with the sauce. I would totally go back next time to try another lunch special option!"}
{"text":"first visit was OK, average... staff friendly, prices decent. more recent visit; plain BAD. order was wrong, got 2 out of 3 right!  and they had to fix one while we waited; so maybe 1 of 3 right... $30 for 3 items; not great.  more importantly food was POOR. Chicken Pad Thai by name leads you to believe it has CHICKEN in it...  Almost NO chicken at all.  The orange chicken (didn't order) was terrible.  Ginger Beef average.   DON'T BE SO CHEAP ON THE MEAT...  I know it's pricey, but whole order was disappointing.  That pad thai with the 2 tiny pieces of chicken probably cost you about .80 cents to make, the container is more expensive than the noodles. Enough to not want to go back... anddddd...  we both had stomach issues from the meal, to make things worse..."}
{"text":"Sept. 11. Whenever I try a place for the first time, I order something popular in the cuisine they offer. Needless to say, I ordered  Pad Thai. It was absolutely awesome! I can compare it to the Pad Thai at Khao San Road. Now I don't have to go to downtown Toronto and wait for a table for half an hour because Ranu Thai Cuisine is just in my backyard. The cook there told me that their patrons vouch for their Tom Yum too. And I can't wait to have that on my next visit.  Oct. 9. Second review, albeit short, for a different dish. Tried their Green Curry with beef. It definitely didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5, but I wanted to click the full 4 stars because of the customer service.  I was in the area for work and it was a beautiful afternoon, so I decided to take a walk to finally visit this place.  It's really the definition of a hole in the wall, but the best food comes from these places, right?  I ordered the lunch special chicken pad thai that comes with a spring roll and salad.  I thought the salad was the best part of the meal.  Sorry pad thai!  This salad was fresh as hell.  The man working behind the counter cut some of the veggies on the spot and put the ingredients together one by one.  This ain't no pre-made salad.  It was the perfect mango salad, with some lettuce.  I enjoyed this because I was also able to get some greens in.  The cilantro was the cherry on top.  Just made everything taste even fresher.  The pad thai I felt was missing something.  Maybe it was missing a little sweetness.  It didn't taste like what I'm use to having, but this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  It was...different.  I still enjoyed it though.  The chicken pieces were nice bite sizes and there wasn't to much or too little.  Portion was DEFS worth it.  Th whole meal cost $9 something.  I had enough salad and pad thai for lunch AND dinner.  Spring roll had a nice crunch.  It was no big deal to me.  It's just a regular schmegular spring roll.  The man behind the counter who took my order and made my food was super nice and friendly.  He did everything all while smiling.  When my picky self asked for less bean spouts, it was no problem.  I really hope this business continues to flourish!  They deserve it!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST Thai food in Toronto, just close to humber college! They have great selection in an affordable price and I personally love fried rice a lot and they make the basil fried rice so well! They also have lunch special too, try their calamari for sure, has a strong taste to it but I loved it, it wasn't chewy at all, it was amazingly crispy and soft. Try the curry dishes as well with white rice, they make it so well. Great food for a take out while you're studying and they are super friendly and happy staff, total thumbs up for these guys!"}
{"text":"I go to Green Mango Boys once a week for Pad Thai but, with the Christmas crowd at Cloverdale, I decided to check Ranu Thai out since it had great reviews.  OK, I can't stress enough what a hole in wall it was - very small, open kitchen and teensy bar/sitting area.  I ordered Pad Thai with chicken and the gentlemen who took/cooked my order was really sweet and friendly.  He cooked the food on a flat top (not wok) and I saw him adding carrots and cabbage to it ... isn't that unconventional?  Then he picked up the bean sprouts (without gloves) and mixed them into the noodles - aren't they supposed to go on top as a garnish?  I thought that it was possible I was being too picky as it did look good in the container (see pic).   Anyway, maybe it's just me but I didn't like it.  The noodles were very dry and bland and I could smell the fish sauce which was putting me off of the dish.  I did NOT care for the addition of the carrots and cabbage; I could taste a bit of ginger and some other perfume-y spice which I can't pinpoint the identity.  No sign of tamarind which, in my opinion, is essential to the dish.  Again, very unconventional.  I hate to say it but I only ate a small plate and had to toss the rest.  Would I go again?  Likely not as I like saucy, spicy, sour-y Pad Thai.  I don't want to encourage others not to try it because I think it was just a matter of taste.  Two stars because it was nice service."}
{"text":"A true definition of hole in the wall restaurant, looks like family or friends owned, could hear the chefs speaking thai language loudly, we were given out water in coffee cups and hopefully they were not used, plates and forks are family style, only 2 tables so I think this place is more of a take out place, don't believe there was a bathroom since this place was so tiny that the kitchen was literally infront of us, kind of reminds me more of a sushi bar  But all in all, awesome food at affordable prices, they told me the pad Thai omelette was a traditional dish but it was nothing special to me for an extra $1.50 more, could have just stir fry it with eggs and it taste the same, big portions and friendly service, a true authentic thai place"}
{"text":"Finally i decent Thai place in the neighborhood.  We've only ordered once with takeout, and the food was good.  Great pad thai, delicious currys, and the basil beef was amazing.  They can be a little more generous on the meat (as noted from another reviewer) however everything is very tasty.  Quick delivery - we ordered on NYE, and the food arrived in 40 mins!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm a non-pretentious guy and this place is a very basic mom-and-pop type of restaurant. I had a chat with the owner as I've been to Thailand and he is very personable and helpful. I commended him on the good food at extremely fair pricing and he explained that the low price was to cater to the nearby college students, which completely works for me. I live outside of their delivery zone, however I discovered them randomly when in the area and using yelp. Even though I hadn't ordered in advance, I doubt it took 10 minutes to prepare my two entrées which arrived for $20 including tax."}
{"text":"So good. Sooo good.   Found this place by coincidence. The portions are huge, the food is fresh and tasty, the prices are super reasonable, and you get freebies for orders over certain amounts. Plus, they're LOVELY people there.   We often order three mains for two of us and seriously have leftovers for days.   The pad thai is good, pad see ew super tasty, tropical fried rice is crazy addictive, and the panang curry has an awesome kick to it if you're into a bit of spice.   Solid choice for a takeout dinner :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall restaurant. Pretty decent pad thai - I'd give it a nice 7.5/10. The papaya salad was quite refreshing. Customer service is impeccable. Overall, the place has an authentic thai feel to it and I'd recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really small and perfect for to go.  Always have customer comes to order food, and the owner of course is very cute and friendly. There is some space to eat there and kind of comfortable If u dont require too much.  I order amai and 1 curry. For me the curry is the best, very yummy and even more than Thai express.  I will go back here to try more next time."}
{"text":"I had Penang curry with vegetables. It comes with steamed rice. The staff at the cash is very pleasant and accommodating. There is limited dine in capacity. Food tasted excellent and was of very good quality. I am happily surprised.  This venue is better than it appears."}
{"text":"Ranu Thai Cuisine is a little hole in the restaurant. Dining here kind of feel like eating street food in Thailand.  We were the only one that dine in as most of the customers were all ordering take out. I am not surprised as there is hardly any proper dine in area and we were sitting on wobbly stools and eating on small counter space.   We shared:  Pad Thai Omelette ($9.99) - One of the best in Toronto! Brought back memories of eating in the night market at Changi Mai! Portion is really generous too!  Mango Salad ($5.99) - refreshing   Panang Curry Chicken ($7.99) - nicely done but I prefer a little more spice. My Yelp friend really enjoyed that though.  The spice definitely toned down but if you prefer to have your food more spicy just ask!   For dessert, we really want to try their Thai Custard Sticky Rice but that might need to be pre ordered!   I would be going back to Ranu Thai Cuisine next time when I am in the neighbourhood for more authentic Thai food. And hopefully I can have some Thai Custard too.."}
