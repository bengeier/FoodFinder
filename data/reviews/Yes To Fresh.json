{"text":"I love this place. It is clean, simple and healthy. It is set-up similar to Freshii, when you walk in, you grab a mini clipboard and fill out your choices. Pick the greens, the toppings and then your protein. They have a sandwich counter and the other is the salad counter.  

I've been twice & I've ordered the same salad twice! The salad is huge and is under 10 bucks. 

**warning, the salad takes FOREVER to eat. I jokingly call it the Homer salad (Simpsons reference ha ha).  It would be a great salad to share since it really isn't the same the next day**"}
{"text":"The business is closed.   Their website says so as well: http://www.yestofresh.com/"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad with pea's as one of my topping. The peas are from a can....how is that Yes To Fresh?Brown mushie peas from a can. It's summer prime time for fresh veggies"}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy take out food in the King and Jarvis area and googled just that....\"Yes to Fresh\" came up and after skimming a few awesome reviews I headed over to get dinner for myself and 3 friends (prior to this I was holding  a pizza menu in my hand hoping for a better idea)  Once I got there I filled out the four individual order forms...very efficient and I am sure saves the staff and customers a lot of aggravation as they have sooo many choices.  Chatted with the friendly staff while I waited for them to prepare my fresh food (they even added some rice paper spring roll wraps that they were making for training for me to sample)  

I got back home just as my guests arrived. I handed them each a cute little box with their name on it containing their meal and we all completely devoured and enjoyed our custom made fresh delicious creations from \"Yes to Fresh\"!!!i  Everyone LOVED it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for a gluten-free sandwich (very excited that they offer this option).  Great selection of sandwich fillers - all was fresh and tasty.  My only comment it that the bread fell apart.  Had to eat with a knife and fork!
I know it's hard to find 'substantial' GF bread for sandwiches, but it may be worth sourcing some other options. 
Nevertheless - I will go back again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far; it reminds me a bit of Sandwich Box. Great for a quick grab and go sandwich. They also have other hot bowl rice and noodle options which I may try in the future. The sandwiches are quite good."}
{"text":"This new health gourmet fresh food place is conveniently located on Jarvis north of Front and south of King. 

Yes to Fresh serves gourmet fresh soups, chili, grilled sandwiches, grilled wraps,and salads. An average meal is 7.50$ tax included for a gourmet 6 topping sandwich with a side salad/soup, or a large custom 6 gourmet ingredients salad. 

The ingredients are all fresh gourmet high quality ingredient. You can choose from different types of specialty breads (rosemary foccacia, olive bread, panini, multigrain, french baguette, wraps). 

Salads have a large assortment of lettuce (arugula, baby spinach, iceberg, romaine, spring mix, custom blend) and ingredients similar to Freshii.

I went and sampled the grilled slow roasted roastbeef (you can choose cajun turkey, grilled chicken, pork or vegetarian)sandwich on rosemary foccacia bread with swiss cheese (you can also choose brie, asiago, havartie, mozarella, tex mex, or cheddar), grilled zucchini and red roasted peppers, with a special roasted red pepper spread (you can choose hummus, avocado, basil pesto, garlic, goat cheese, sundried tomato, The Mercury, Tex Mex).  The sandwich was melting in my mouth. I also customized  a small side salad with romaine lettuce, cheery tomatoes, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and bacon bits topped with ceasar dressing.

If you are looking for high quality, fresh, and delicious fare for lunch and dinner, this place is for you!

They serve homemade chilli, butternut squash soup, and any custom sandwich or salad that your heart desires...all at a reasonable price. 

The restaurant/take-out opens its doors top the public today!"}
{"text":"I went there based on the great reviews but I'm not impressed. Maybe it was an off day but I won't be back. It was bland ,mushy, falling apart, took more than 15 minutes to get (there was no ahead of me) and cost be almost 10$ I'll go Subway the next time I'm in the mood for a sandwich"}
{"text":"Affordable, large sizes, excellent service. The only thing I wish was that they were open later. Otherwise, superb."}
{"text":"I work in the area and when a couple of my friends suggested we go, I was happy to finally be able to try it.  They've gone a few times and keep telling me how amazing it is.  

Filling out the form took me a little while because all of their (many!) choices sounded so delicious!   I decided on a sandwich and got to choosing my toppings and filling.  Soooo delicious!  

We just got back to the office and I've already forgotten everything that I ordered...there are THAT many delicious toppings to choose from!  

I have a feeling that no matter which toppings you go with, you're going to love your lunch!

They had me at olive bread..."}
{"text":"I went here today after buying 2 Wag Jag Express certificates for a hot box order and sandwich/tortilla chips order so I saved $4.50 BUT, they have $6 specials on select sandwiches/wraps from 3-6pm the same time the Wag Jag Express voucher was valid so no need for a voucher.

Everything was very fresh and delicious and what was probably the owner was incredibly friendly telling me all about their store and how they prepare everything including roasting the meats themselves.

Nice place and good food, a little bit overpriced for my taste, probably because they can't compete with the mass-buying power of Subway but it was a good restaurant to support and a quick 10 minute walk from the Financial District."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The staff is super friendly, the food is excellent and very well-done. It's also very conveniently-located. Absolutely recommended if you're in the mood for a healthy option. Never had any problems with the speed of getting your order done, despite what some people mentioned. A+"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here looking for cheap and healthy, I got tasty and healthy instead and I can't complain about that. Sure my salad bowl was not cheap but it's massive and with 7 toppings (additional ones can be had for extra $) it's a great meal. They did have a $6 wrap special so not all their options are upwards of $8. The process of ordering can be a little complicated but the guy behind the counter did a good job in explaining the ordering process and how I had to fill out a checklist much akin to ordering at a freshii. When I brought it over to him it almost felt like I hand handed in a paper and was standing waiting for it to get marked. With a can of pop it came up to just over $10 and it more than fills you up, I wouldn't recommend getting any additional toppings such as meet for extra $2 or $3 since the basic salad option itself would be enough to fill most people. 

They have basic tables set up with 2 couches by the entrance for 2 lucky customers, I went in at 5pm on a weekday and I was the only one dining there with only 2 other people stopping by for take out, so it doesn't seem to be a very crowded spot (but maybe during lunch hour, health conscious GBC students might crowd it). 

Overall a very solid bet for a quick healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Go and try out their SOY MILK, MANGO & LYCHEE smoothie. 
It is $4.50 for a small including tax.

It is amazing and will burst your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"I just got back from Yes to Fresh and knew that I have to immediately write a review here.... Their sandwiches are AMAZING!!!!! Wowwww. I downed my sandwich in about 3 minutes, that's how INCREDIBLE it was. I listened to the recommendations of one of the reviewers below but just tweeked it slightly:

Olive bread
Garlic spread 
Brie cheese
Roasted turkey
Caramelized onion
Grilled Zucchini
Tomato
Red onion

^^The best combo EVER!!! And you also get a delicious small salad on the side. All for just 7.50!! (about 8.50 including tax)."}
{"text":"Had my first experience at this amazing little sandwich/salad shop
near the St Lawrence market (Corner of Jarvis and King beside the second cup)

priced well: a little more then subway sub and cheaper then a freshii wrap
for 7.50 you get an amazing sandwich with a side of salad or nacho chips

This place is delicious! 
i suggest:

Olive bread 
with their house made basil pesto spread
Turkey
caramelized onion, zucchini, bean sprouts and tomato
finished with brie then grilled.... EPIC!

i hope to see alot more of these locations in the near future,
but go check it out!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out as an alternative to the crappy sandwiches and salads available for a quick lunch in the Queen's Quay Loblaws. Went on a weekday during lunch, and there was about 2 people ahead of me, so not long of a wait. (*Disclaimer: this may quickly change as we alert the staff in our office of its existance.) Clean and colourful space with very friendly staff. 

The concept: You get a menu with 6 or so steps to creating your own freshly made, custom sandwich or salad. Loved the choice of breads (multigrain, bagette, wrap, etc.) and the wide array of meats and veggies and sauces. They have practically anything you can think of that you might want on your salad or in your sandwhich - including artichokes, grilled zuchinni, caramalized onions, and my very favourite - sundried tomatoes! (YUM!). My biggest thumbs up came from the assortment of REAL cheese you can pick from - harvari, tex mex (harvarti with jalapenos), swiss, brie, etc. And the cost of the cheese is built into the price. For about $8.50 you get a great sandwhich or heaping salad (my co-worker got a mean looking salad with a dressing called \"Champagne\" - will need to ask him about the taste and if it was boozey) and a side of crispy totillas with a really refreshing salsa or mixed greens.

*Bonus: 
- The salads come with a great bonus of being able to choose your lettuce. If you're like me and hate mixed greens, you can get arugla, romaine, or a mix of both. 
- There are also a ton of gluten-free options
- You can order ahead and pick up to avoid the wait.

Great, quick way to order a fresh, healthy lunch on the go. The wait for the sandwich was about 6 or 7 minutes, however, so factor that in if you're super rushed + any wait in line. I forsee myself returning muchly."}
