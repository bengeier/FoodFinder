{"text":"First timer!!! I love this place!!! Unlike someone in most uptight review, I love the fact that this place is authentic: old building, booths, bar stools, wooden tables, Leave it to Beaver playing on their tv, and best of all-the delicious country, home cooked food!!! The servers are the best-I've been spoiled by their service!! They wear Kopper Kettle T-shirts which proudly display that this place has been family owned since 1971...they must be doing something right!!!
I ordered chicken and dumplings, green beans and fried squash (I almost ordered banana puddin' as one of my sides but didn't). They served cornbread with my meal. Every bite was wonderful, the sweet tea is amazing with a pitcher on my table!! I saw many other plates of various lunch specials being served...it all looks amazing!!! And the hard working blue collar (several white collars too) guys, who fill this place, know where to go for some yummy food!!! I'm glad I found this place! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Food was GREAT!! It was 3 in my party and we CLEANED OUR PLATES! ! Service was really friendly. I will be back!! If you haven't tried them yet please do there nothing like local people who care that serves you great food!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little mom and pop.  Menu looked good and I had the steak special, a little too salty for my tasted but a great value.

Sometimes when you go to places like this (local) you get funny stares and the server spends all their time with the regulars, This was Not the case, everyone was very friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"Parking is plentiful in this semi-industrial area off Nations Ford. Little building right across from doggy daycare, think it was a house at some point?  Small dining area with another room off to the side. Typical carpeted 70's Southern lunch spot. Got some pork tips with 2 sides and the netorious diet coke in a can (the trick is to get tea- free refills on that).  Service was warm and friendly, food was not great. Two words. Pink Pork. Hopefully I don't get worms or something. The pepper shaker was sticky, ugh what is the deal with that?  Fried okra was that awesome combo of crunchy and slimy and super hot. Pickled beets were interesting, very heavy clove flavor that I really liked. Wished they would have been super cold instead of room temp. Lunch with tip set me back 11 bucks but personally wasn't a fan of the pork tips."}
{"text":"Decent food for a good price. Restaurant is outdated. We had good service to. I would recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in all of Charlotte every time we go there, we are greeted by the nicest people. Because this place is located in industrial area the hours are kind of odd but they really have the best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time yesterday through Door Dash. I ordered breakfast w/ grits (bowl). It was pretty good. The grits were cooked well and creamy. The pancakes were good too. However, we decided to order again today, the exact same thing! The inconsistency is why I only gave 3 stars. Today, my eggs were slimy, and the grits came in a tiny cup instead of in the box. We also ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, bacon extra crispy. It was good, but there was barely any cheese on it. The cheese that was on it seemed like Velveeta or something like that. While it wasn't bad, I just wasn't expecting it. So, in short, I kind of like this place. I just wish I could trust that the consistency will be the same every time I order."}
{"text":"Good prices and a super friendly staff. Definitely a more relaxed vibe here, but quirky and fun all the same. The staff was full of suggestions and very helpful with the menu. They even gave us a heads up that the wings take a bit, which was so thoughtful since we were on a lunch break. They have daily specials too! Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time and will be back. Had the breakfast special..2 eggs, toast,  grits and that southern favorite liver nush. Great service and foid reminded me of breakfast growing up. Old building and decor but that is part of the charm. For breakfast you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"My wife and I ventured out of our vanilla Ballantyne neighborhood on Saturday morning in search of something more nostalgic and homey than the sterile chains in our area. Thanks to Yelp reviews, we discovered the Kopper Kettle in Pineville. What a refreshing experience!

Yes it's old. The booths are wooden and the art work ancient but the food was reasonable and perfectly prepared. I went simple... Two fried eggs, three strips of lean, crispy bacon, grits, two biscuits and coffee.. all for $7.29. Everything was great. My wife was more adventurous and ordered the Greek omelet which was huge and loaded with feta cheese, olives and onions. It was moist and impeccably prepared.

Finally the service was exemplary and warm. I would have been disappointed if our waitress didn't call me honey. I loved the fact that the joint was also filled with regulars. Overall it was a wonderful experience and one I hope to repeat."}
{"text":"Whoah, what happened to this place? Me and a co-worker decided to go for lunch today. Holy cow - the place was practically empty at lunch time? The menu choices weren't that great today either. Did something recently happen to this restaurant? I hate to say it but, this place is off the lunch list."}
{"text":"Just had a Double Cheeseburger w/ Fries and of course Ice Tea :Q}   Wonderful..so good and fresh tomatoes and lettuce !! The Fries are wonderful...crispy !!"}
{"text":"We keep searching for a good breakfast spot in Charlotte, where it's not super expensive, you don't have to wait 30-40 minutes for a table, the food is great and the service friendly and quick. Bingo! We finally found this old, small restaurant. Best corned beef hash I've had in Charlotte, and best fried potatoes (not hash browns, not home fries, not dusted chunks). The coffee was great and the overall vibe was very welcoming with a wide variety of clientele. Could be our go-to spot, if we get up early enough. They only served until 11:30 am!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food!!!

I noticed some less than stellar reviews - I used to eat at the KK 25 years ago when the Karnezis's owned it....  Over time it changed hands, and know it is back in their hands!  So if you tried it in the past and were not happy, try it again!"}
{"text":"Cheap, good comfort food. This place has been around a long time, the wait staff is super friendly, and the tea is super sweet.

You can't go wrong with their fried fish-it was delicious!, or the meat and two they have every day."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover.  Hands down best French fries, and great lunch specials.   Grab the carrot cake when it's available.  Decor and atmosphere is definitely a blast from the past.  Staff is no nonsense, but friendly.  My go-to quick bite close to work.  Expect to need a nap after you leave"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant.  I enjoy their breakfast and lunch. Food is always fresh and very good.

Has been in business as long as I can remember.  Looking for a good home cooked meal this is a place to try."}
{"text":"My wife Sandy an i have breakfast here everyday of the week.  The owners treat us and the other customers as a VIP.  The staff is very attentative and personable.  We always are greated with a smile and leave smiling.  We have been to several resturants  in Charlotte and the service and food are exceptional!  We would give 10 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic breakfast! The service was outstanding.  Be sure to try the Livermush!  Can't wait to go back for lunch. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food! I had the meat lovers omelette. It was the best omelette I've had in my life. They were not stingy on the meat like in most omelettes. Everyone was very nice. Great customer service! Till we meet again kopper kettle..."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to state openly that the scary leaning shack in the back has been demolished and is in the process of being disposed of."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and it had the feel and tastes of grandmas cooking. Loved it. And great service  I highly recommend this spot. Thanks and keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I was perusing my old reviews and realized that I had a response for the one star rating I had left. I always appreciate when an owner reaches out, and Sara informed me that this place is under new management and promises that it would have people raving over how delicious it is!! If I lived in the area I'd love to come back out and give it another shot. Based on the new reviews I think Sara would definitely deliver the experience I'd originally hoped for :D"}
{"text":"The food was ok - basic simple, the omelette was large and tasty.  
The coffee was watery"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Charlotte I've had. Definitely recommend the French Toast Biscuits. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for about 2 months on business venture. If you like down home cooking like I do you'll like this place. Will try to make the 5:30 start breakfast tomorrow. My previous breakfast there was great. Wish I could cook eggs that spot on. Many places I've frequented for breakfast in my travels over salt or under cook the grits....I recommend. This place is only open for breakfast and lunch during the week, breakfast only on Saturday. Straight up truth.... I normally eat lunch at the counter, get my supper to go.
Ed"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is really good however their lunch could use some work. A lot of the vegetables are watered down and don't have much flavor. I would recommend trying this place on a Tuesday when they serve their baked chicken. It's really good."}
{"text":"Found this little place while looking to grub before an interview and so glad I did. Tried a bacon egg and cheese on a French toast biscuit!! Can you say heaven on earth? CoZy little family restaurant very quiet and the service was awesome! I'd definitely love to come check out more on the menu. Parking lot is huge and plenty of eating space"}
{"text":"If you want a down home, country breakfast- PLEASE FIND THIS HIDDEN GEM. The service was great and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"When a place is opened 45 years you know they are doing something right. I would have never ventured in here because it is not in a road that I am normally on. But we were coming home from a road trip and was searching for some comfort food we were very pleased. We came in and were seated right away. There seemed to be tons of regulars but we didn't feel out of place at all! We ordered French toast, biscuits and gravy and a breakfast platter. Simple, but it hit the spot! 

They are opened 5am-2:30pm, serving breakfast and Lunch!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful family owned  'joint'. 
This is the kind of place you see in movies... great home cooked meals, affordable prices, family atmosphere, country living, and conversations. This place has character! The food was good, but the overall experience was better! I was so blessed to meet the owner and his daughter. They carried on conversations with the customers like we were old friends or family. If you're new to the area or just passing through- this place is exactly what you need for a little taste of southern culture! Forget about cracker barrel and help support the small local family businesses! You won't be disappointed. This place and its staff all have a story. Don't miss out on the opportunity to join it!"}
{"text":"I have been eating breakfast and lunch at the Kopper Kettle for over 20 years and it never disappoints.  I get eggs over easy with grits and liver mush and it is always great.  My wife loves the Greek omelette.  The staff is super friendly.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"It's not a great neighborhood, surrounded by industrial properties and right off the Interstate. Still, it's a classic and the food probably hasn't changed in forty years. \"Comfort\" options abound. Prices are quite reasonable, too.

I took a seat at the counter and enjoyed a bit of cable television with my meal. I never did find out if Maverick was able to help that nice newspaper lady.

I ordered a cheese omelet, which came with toast and home fries. Interesting potatoes, which were closed to mashed and then grilled. Good, but different. Omelet was a good portion.

Lots and lots of coffee. I'll be back to the Kettle, no doubt."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had on the south side...rustic on the inside but that's what makes it good and the food, forget about it!!!!!"}
