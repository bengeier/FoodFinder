{"text":"No good!!! If you want good mexican food go to DON PANCHO it on central in Avondale not far from this location ..WORTH THE GAS!!!"}
{"text":"So I just returned from Bordeaux, France and Venice,  Italy.  I've been living here in Fountain Hills and eating at Senior Taco for over 10 years.  It's finally time to write this review.  Senior Taco is my go to comfort Mexican place when I get home from my travels.  I can honestly say this is better than much of the food I had this past week in Europe.  And we ate at some very expensive and nice restaurants.  Okay I didn't have Mexican food there but in terms of quality and the flavors that are in this food.... Senior Taco For The Win!!!  From the enchiladas to the burritos and tacos everything is bursting with flavor.  The salsas are to die for (especially the roasted chili oil.)  The portions are huge and I almost always finish what I order.  Do you know why...?  Go to senior taco, order anything and you will understand.  This place simply ROCKS!!  OH,  and the Margaritas are pretty good too.  Mucho Bueno!!  I don't hand out 5stars easily."}
{"text":"Came here because of the yelp reviews and really enjoyed our meal. We did the taco combos and had way too much food. The carnitas were really flavorful.  Not much ambience but the tasty food more than made up for that!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. A step up from the bertos places. Try the grande breakfast burrito or se√±or dinner burrito. They are massive, feed 2-3 people and are under $10.  Green sauce is bomb, don't care for their red sauce. Usually I am the other way around"}
{"text":"Super fan! I have yet to have a bad experience here. Rolled tacos are great, basic bean and cheese burrito is huge. The employees are always super nice and it might not be the fastest service BUT the quality is there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is awesome and the employees are great. Love their homemade tortilla chips. They also have great $5 deals. I love the beef or chicken  rolled tacos."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos...and great price!  Definitely worth it.  Clean tables, floors, etc.  Need more soap in men's room, though."}
{"text":"I love the lunch specials!  The beef tacos are my fav. Super yummy and prices are great!"}
{"text":"The food just gets worse and is now awful - can't eat this carnitas it's rubbery and the guacamole is not avocado, all the salsas are watered down and the rice and beans are tasteless. I'm gonna be sick. They must have been bought by Filabertos or something. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ordered a special they gave me wrong plate and told me since it was made I had to pay for the order they screwed up.  Horrible customer service, if the kid paid more attention to order instead of flirting with girls."}
{"text":"An authentic, delicious, affordable hole in the wall with drive through restaurant.  My children loved the bean tostada and steak taco.  I enjoyed the shrimp burrito.  Restaurant was clean and seating was nice."}
{"text":"Great food.  The Hashbrown Breakfast burrito is the best!  The chips and salsa are the best in the area, we order them to go for parties.  If they served beer they'd have gotten the 5th star. (and I probably wouldn't eat any place else) :-)"}
{"text":"Food here is good but I usually frequent the one in North Scottsdale.  What kept me from an easy 5 star is the cleanliness.  The cushions felt sticky and probably could have used a good scrubbing."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My favorite hangover spot. My guy is an Easterner and is still learning the world of Mexican food and he loves this place. Burritos are freaking huge so definitely worth the price. The salsa is so tasty. I actually avoid getting the burrito enchilada style so I can dowse it in salsa instead. I don't recommend the breakfast burritos because there's too much egg and potato and not enough meat. But the shredded beef burrito and carne asada Burrito are my favorites. The shredded beef is so moist and flavorful I can't get over it. Also, I'd skip the extra charge for beans and rice. Rice is just OK but the beans taste off. It always tastes like there's cinnamon or something in them. And I think 2 extra bucks is a little steep for something as unbelievable cheap like rice and beans."}
{"text":"Finally tired of getting my order wrong almost every time. Usually I just bring it back and have them fix it a second time. After so many times of doing that, this time would be the last. The best part was when the guy was trying to tell me they almost got the order right, so I should be cool with it lol."}
{"text":"Finally they opened one out my way. The food is delicious here.  Try the crunchy breakfast burrito. The food comes out very fast and they have good portions."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Passed by and decided to give it a try.  Staff was real nice and food was very good - all of us ordered something different and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Though unlike much of Fountain Hills, Senor Taco is also a stop that no cullinary tour of fountain hills should be without.  Their salsa bar delights, especially the salsa verde.  Not a ton of ambiance inside--hence the drive-thru is a popular option.  Many swear by the Shrimp Burrito; I think their quesadillas are equally enjoyable and substantial!"}
{"text":"I used to live in San Diego so I hold Mexican food standards pretty high. Senior Taco was just alright. I ordered the California Surfin' burrito. I'm used to having just pico de gallo in my carne asada burritos and having the meat be the primary source of flavor. This burrito had a chipotle sauce in it which I didn't care for too much. It over powered the flavor of the meat. The serving size was great. It was a nice sized burrito with a fair amount of shrimp."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this place!  Whether it is in Mesa, Chandler, or Tempe they have great food!  They had great specials in the past so hopefully they will bring some of the specials back. There food is fresh and very good!"}
{"text":"Great carnitas.  A little pricey for a taqueria, but damned good!"}
{"text":"Beans, carne asada, great service, & hot food...not to mention it's CHEAP! I don't care where you go...the carne asada is less fatty & the beans are the best!!!!! MMMMM MMMMM"}
{"text":"Sooooo Good and open late. I do not possess the vocabulary capable of adequately expressing the food's quality. Best quick bite to eat ever. This is my late night go to place. Can't believe it's right here in FH."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this location. We usually go here a few times a month and have been for years but the quality in customer service and food has been on the decline recently. The other night we had three nachos ordered up by which I specifically stated to the young man at the drive through three times no tomatoes on two of them as my husband and son are allergic. I also had to correct him twice that we wanted three tostadas. I verified my order with him at the window confident I would receive it correctly. My bad that I did not check until I got home, tomatoes on all three and only two tostadas not three. We threw away $20.00 worth of food. The nachos were also very cold and we only live 5 min. away, meat was dry and not worth the money spent. I hope this location can get it together or likely we will now frequent the new Fillbertos opening up in town."}
{"text":"Not sure why but we regretfully tried this place again maybe thinking after a couple years since our previous experience that they would get their shit together. Nope, we were wrong! This time our food took almost 50 minutes to prepare(i timed it). Also, same crappy service! DON'T GO THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Really great food for a great price! Everything I've ordered has been delicious  but I love their battered fish tacos. The seasoned rice is always light and fluffy, making a nice complement to the meal.  Everything is flavorful and the salsa bar has something for all tastes. It's such an affordable, fast, and convenient place. Crazy to get such quality food for the same price as a typical fast food meal. Only marking them one star off for the decor of the eating area; not bad but could be a little more inviting."}
{"text":"Came to Fountain Hills for a little staycation. Sunday we wanted to find a place to eat lunch, only to find 90% of the restaurants in Fountain Hills are closed Sundays. Not afraid of a hole in the wall, we stopped by Senor Taco. I order fish tacos and my husband ordered a beef taco and a chicken enchilada. They have a wonderful salsa bar, and although no table service for chips and salsa,  they accommodated our craving for a basket of chips no problem. Food came quickly.  Fish tacos were fried to perfection, flaky and delicious, with plenty of Pico and white sauce.  My husbands taco was huge, and fried to perfection as well. We tried the green and red salsas, I liked the green best. Chips were nice and salty. Enchilada was also huge, and my husband said the enchilada sauce tasted homemade. Overall, great experience,  so happy they were open on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is ok and clean. Had tacos today (Tuesday). It was alright, not great. Sauce is too watered down. Lack flavor. Over all i give it 3 stars"}
{"text":"Senior Taco has delicious food.  Friendly service.  affordable prices.  This restaurant is one of my husband and I favorite places to enjoy a meal.  Must try the fish tacos and tostadas."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and the whole family was happy with the food! I got chicken tacos (yum!), my husband got a Philly cheesesteak, one kid got a breakfast platter and the other got a cheese quesadilla.  It is rare to find somewhere that everyone likes.  We even got all three types of cake. I meant to take a picture of the menu but I guess I'll just have to go again so I can do that.  The staff was very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I had the Chile Verde burrito enchilada style and it was fantastic! The meat was well prepared, not fatty at all & great refried beans. Very big menu selection, much to select from. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what crack-smokers rated this place highly (no offense - everyone needs a little help getting by some days.)  Wife and I stopped in post Christmas shopping at about 1pm on the 24th.  Sign said they'd be open until 3pm...  Ordered our food and sat down.  But it's a bit tricky because we couldn't find a clean table (and there were only 2 tables taken in the place.)  We get our food and the first thing we notice is the stack of napkins (that had been put there by the friendly employee) are all stuck together with well-dried salsa (not some on-the-tray mishap, no this had plenty of time to set up crispy hard.)  Wife NOT happy.  So I hop up to get more.  Only to find the stack in the self service area (along with most of the self-serve stuff) has also been lightly drizzled with various salsas throughout the day.  Awesome!  Dig out some from the bottom that appear untouched but things are looking bad.  Sit down to my beef burrito and it's, ummm, disgusting.  I don't know what beef they use but it has no flavor - the whole concoction tasted the same (if you got beef, sauce or cheese, didn't matter - one flavor and not a good one.)  The beef itself had that mushy consistency that you get with over-processed frozen dinners...  And in the spirit of healthy flavoring, there wasn't a fresh vegetable (onion?  cilantro?  Oh no, that would be muy fancy!  There MAY have been beans but we couldn't tell by looking and you certainly couldn't feel them in a bite.)  Can't remember what my wife had but we didn't finish either meal.  And the customer service?  Ten minutes after we get there, the counter help takes down the \"Closing at 3pm\" door sign and changes the time to 2pm.  We left before 1:30 and they had already locked the door.  As we walked out, two other couples tried to walk in but were told the restaurant had closed."}
{"text":"Great food but totally worthless at the drive thru.  Two times ive gone here in the last week and it took them five minutes before they even took my order....both times...with no cars in front of me...also both times.  Short of an unusually long wait they have amazingly good mexican food at a fair price.  I will go back and i hope that they read this and work on that one little issue."}
{"text":"The \"Carnitas\" are fantastic!  But so is everything else on the menu. Without exception, the best  Mexican food in and around town.  Great food, extensive menu selections, friendly and inviting customer service -- what else can you ask for?  Oh yeah!  Happy Hour Specials.....Exceptional!   Rosa"}
{"text":"Had this delivered via Uber Eats and I tried it for the 1st time, I had the combination with taco's and tostada. SO good! Will go back again!"}
{"text":"My West Valley go to place for fast Mexican food. The winners here are the hashbrown burrito, carne asada fries, and cali chicken burrito.   Top choice: ¬†California Chicken Burrito. There's something about the crunchy fries mixing with the savory chicken, cheese, sour cream, and love that oozes amazing!¬†  Overall, the food quality is fresh, consistent, and delicious with a great value for the price you pay.   Exemplary customer service. The staff is always smiling, always joking, and always helpful.   Hungover? They serve SCRUMPTIOUS menudo on Saturday and Sunday morning. Better get there fast otherwise it will be gone by 10 AM."}
{"text":"I Absolutely Love This Place. I Get A Shrimp Cocktail. For The Quality The Price Is Perfect. I Like That They Take Their Time And Cook My Food. I Do not Mind Any Waiting Time."}
{"text":"In the Mexican restaurant hierarchy, Senor Taco falls between a Macayo's and a Filiberto's, so people need to just accept it for what it is.  It is a step up from a berto's and just below Macayo's, but it is cheap, fast and pretty tasty.  They are mostly famous for their shrimp burritos, they are generously filled and full of flavor.  Plus they have lots of great daily specials.  The ingredients are fresh and they offer a nice little salsa bar too.  Don't go in expecting to be blown away, and you just might be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Service was great, dog friendly patio and clean place. The food however was a bit too greasy for us. Overall ok, but not amazing as we had hoped."}
{"text":"I have passed this little place by a million times on random trips to the grocery store. Today my husband and I finally popped in for a quick, cheap lunch. While we weren't expecting Frontera Grill, we were appalled with the MOLDY breading on the fish tacos. We brought it to the attention of the gal taking orders, and were offered a replacement (pass) but no refund. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The other locaton in Fountain Hills is better than this one but still only average.  I tried this location a few times but the last time I went I was served cold enchiladas with dried out rice in my combo, the beans weren't bad.  Yes, I mentioned the enchiladas and rice to the guy behind the counter and he could have cared less.  No offer to replace the food or refund or even a \"Sorry.\"  Also, this location could be cleaner, the other location is always pretty clean."}
{"text":"Awesome food, affordable, and great service all in the same place. Wow you got to try this place.."}
{"text":"Messed up my order and gave it to the wrong customer. Than refused to give me a refund when I was short on time"}
{"text":"The food is good but the after taste is just bad it's too stuffing and the Brito is huge"}
{"text":"Wow! So much improvement needed at this location. I've been a loyal customer to both the Scottsdale and Mesa locations for a few years now. The Flautas at the Scottsdale location are filling and delicious for the value you get. I ordered flautas at this location and received the wrong meat ( ordered chicken and received scant beef)  with two of what were basically taquitos for $4.31."}
{"text":"Loyal customer cause their food is good BUT after sending in my son to pick up our order like we always do, we noticed on 5-19-17 that we were charged 2x for our order.  Went in, showed the receipt and management had the nerve to say ITS not their fault, take it up with your bank.  We showed proof that they charged our card 2x and they did nothing to resolve it.  I will not ever go back, disappointed in their customer service.  Check your accounts people you to may be double charged.  They could care less about their customers."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. I ordered a 2 taco combo one carne asada and one pollo asado. The taco shells were thick and hard. The meat was bland. I had to put lots of sauce on it to give it some spice. Also, I ordered tortilla chips and a drink. My total was $11.48. I could've gone to a nice sit down restaurant and received something that tasted much better for what I paid. Next time I will drive the extra 3 miles to go to chipotle when I'm craving tacos."}
{"text":"The best carne asada burrito in town. I wish they open one in scottsdale. Great horchata and their hot sauce is the best."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, friendly service. The cashier and chef were joking around the whole time, they seemed to really enjoy themselves. The tacos themselves were great, plenty of filling and sauce, they weren't dry at all. Price was a little on the high side, I easily spent $20 for 2 people, though that could have just been my aching stomach."}
{"text":"Wow I cant believe that guy did not like your fish tacos. I think they are the best. Keep up the good work I love Senor Taco Tacos."}
{"text":"The enchiladas were mediocre. No effort was put into the food. The carne asada burritos were awful. The salsa was rancid tasting. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"The Valley of the Sun has it's prevalance of *Bertos taco joints--Filebertos, Humbertos, Rolibertos, etc. Way out in FH, the open late (til 3 am on weekends) and thought it's slipped over the years, there is no better deal in FH. Generally good to go with the Shrimp Burrito (even better enchilada style if you can handle that). Most of the rest of the menu is good, thought I was disappointed to find ham rather than chorizo  on a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food in fountain hills!!  Very quick Mexican food, as if the valley needed a another mexican restaurant... but if you haven't been to Senior Taco you are truly missing out... The carne asada burrito... EXCELLENT..."}
{"text":"Always excellent food, and plenty of it. Usually get the shrimp burro or the diablo shrimp burro both are always outstanding."}
{"text":"Love it.  It is much better food than many of the sit down places in Denver.  I would give it higher ratings, but I am assuming AZ is a hotbed of good Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Everything we have tried so far has been great and fresh.  The Senor Burrito can almost feed a family it is huge!"}
{"text":"2nd best place to eat in FH. Don't waste your time eating americanized mexican food at El Encanto....you will overpay and be disappointed.  The Fish tacos at Senor Taco..hands down best I have had yet in phoenix...still not as good as the street stand in Puerto Morales mexico...but close enough."}
{"text":"1st time there & definitely not the last!! Very yummy! Had breakfast burritos. Can't wait to try enchiladas, tacos, etc....  The other reviews helped a lot in making my decision to try it out.... Thx to all!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food! Tastes like frozen food that was reheated.. Only thing good were the chips. Will not return!"}
{"text":"I ordered beef enchiladas and they weren't anything special and I got very sick after eating this food. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"On Tuesdays you can get street tacos for 99 cents. I was curious to know if this was actually a good deal or not, so I purchased two carnitas street tacos and two regular-sized carnitas soft tacos. The two regular-sized carnitas soft tacos came out to $5.99. I weighed each taco individually. Both street tacos came out to 62 g (impressive). One regular taco weighed 196 g while the other weighed 211 g, resulting in an average of 203.5 g. So, uh, just get the regular tacos if you want to pay less per gram.  Anyway, I've come here an average of twice a month for two years because I love the food. If I were to pick one thing that bothers me it would be that they use queso cheese sauce as opposed to actual shredded cheese on the nachos.  Once my ex found a bur in his fish taco but I didn't like him much anyway."}
{"text":"Two words............... Shrimp Burrito  I usually get the squirts from fast mexian food but this place is fine."}
{"text":"Gotta give this place six stars! There's only one \"Taco Stand\" that comes close since Ernie's in North Hollywood closed in the '50s, and that place is in Albuquerque.   We've been doing ST for years and won't travel the Beeline without stopping. Recently they've spruced up the place--looks real nice--fortunately the food DID NOT suffer.  Try the shrimp burro! Their roasted pablano salsa is superior--well, maybe not with the shrimp--well, maybe."}
{"text":"Awesome food, haven't found something yet that I wouldn't recommend The staff is always nice and friendly"}
{"text":"AMAZING! A great price for a bounty of delicious food! Ordered my food with UberEATS, best idea."}
{"text":"Very okay Mexican food, salsa pretty bland, guac not fresh made.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come.  Service was fast."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out in a different part of town than usual and found this gem through Yelp. Great food and good prices.  We really liked it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a about a dozen times, for a quick cheap Mexican meal in the area check it out. It's not the best, but above average. The carne asada quesadilla is my favorite dish. They don't skimp on the meat or beans, great portion. They have also have a salsa bar with good green and hot salsas. I wanted to give it 4 stars but the last few times I've been in girls behind the register haven't been all that friendly."}
{"text":"Sounds like another Mexican fast food joint wrong wrong.  This place has a huge menu with Mexican dishes from breakfast to dinner there is something for everyone. The burritos and quesadillas are huge and tasty.  Everything is reasonably priced.  A great place to get your authentic Mexican food craving fulfilled. Love their refried beans!"}
{"text":"Super slow. Food is good but when I called ahead they said 25-30 min. I thought that was crazy for take out but I went to ace and shopped. Arrived at Se√±or Taco 30 min later and my order hadn't been started yet. The place was packed and everyone was talking about the same thing. Is it really worth the wait? Again, food is good but I hate when my time is wasted. Phone ran off the hook when I called and called 3 times before they answered. Each time I called phone rang like 15 times. When they have help in the kitchen this place rocks. Still here after 44 min."}
{"text":"Eat eat eat...yes!!!  Senor Taco I love you.  Great after drinking food. The only downside they close at 10!  Senor, stay open til 12:00 on weekends, guaranteed success. Surf and turf burrito shrimp carne asada amazing.  Go before they realize the burritos are too big!..and that is not just the beer talking."}
{"text":"Most of the food was decent.   Prices are pretty affordable.   My daughter's quesadilla was not even cooked on one side though.  Makes me wonder what kind of attention all the other food  gets though.  I think we may go somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"what can i say?  it's a 24-hour mexican shop.  their machaca burrito is pretty dang good, one of the best i've had in the valley.  tacos, bean burritos, pretty typical stuff but still pretty good when you need that fix, they're there, any hour of the day (or night)."}
{"text":"We routinely stop at this place on our way out to Highway 87.  We have always been impressed with whatever we ordered.  Picked up a breakfast burrito last week and it was incredible.  So big we had to divide it. We have had the shrimp burrito and it was amazing.  It is fast, friendly and the facility is clean.  If you're hungry, skip the fast food chains and hit this place instead."}
{"text":"Great veggie burrito but slightly too large for me. Wonderful fish tacos. Good margaritas."}
{"text":"I work late most nights and we usually eat at home....tonight we decided to go out and we chose Sr Taco because we love the food.....it was 10:00pm and the posted closing time says 11:00pm...and the doors were locked. We were able to get the attention of one of the workers inside and he proceeded to tell us that they were closed and that sometimes the boss lets them close early. I think if you want to close early, then post your closing time as 10pm...we are very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos are way better than I expected they'd be.   Two presentations of these have convinced me that this wasn't a fluke; Se√±or Taco makes tasty and inexpensive fish tacos."}
{"text":"A great local staple. There are 2 locations in Fountain Hills and a recent one in Scottsdale. Great food as always! I had the beef taco and my boyfriend had the fish tacos! Nice sized portions and they have very inexpensive daily specials. The Fountain Hills location have drive-ins or you can eat in the restaurant. What lacks in ambience or decor is made up  by the tasty food."}
{"text":"Uuummmm.... Thank you for being the go-to place in Fountain Hills for yummy Mexican food. :) The salsa bar is killer... love the chili oil, onions, and pickled carrots!!! Glad this place is open late considering places in Fountain Hills close super early!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on my way home today because it's always crowded when I drive by and that's a good sign! It didn't disappoint! I was expecting more of a fast food place since they have a drive through and the rolled tacos were definitely more of a sit down quality. I'm quite impressed and will be making this a part of the food rotation.  Edit: oh I was so wrong for giving you 4 stars Se√±or Taco! I apologize for my wrongdoing. After having the crunchy breakfast burrito I realize you are easily a 5 star establishment. Please forgive my confusion because HOLY COW!"}
{"text":"I am giving an extra star due to great customer service. Otherwise this was a very MEH experience. The woman in the drive thru was patient with my family and very pleasant. I got a California burrito and it was okay but the carne asada just didn't taste great. It didn't taste grilled and something was missing. I've had sooo many California burritos and this one came up short. I also didn't feel that great afterwards so this is a no return for me."}
{"text":"Love this place. Not the fanciest looking joint, but it has the best Mexican food I've ever had! Well done!"}
{"text":"Always empty inside when I pick up for dinner, but everything is always delicious and the portions are huge. I'm guessing the lunch hour is more crowded. It is one of the cleanest taco joints I've been too."}
{"text":"Every time I order Nachos thru the Drive Thru at either FH location, I get something different. This time I got the melted orange cheese sparely poured on some of the chips.  Chicken balls, round shaped chicken balls about as big as my thumb nail and a BIG pile of jalapenos in one corner. Four ingredients.  I should have checked as you know the saying about \"drive thru service\" This cost me almost $10.  IF I go inside I can tell them exactly what I'm expecting:  chips, cheese (I like both kinds but they should ask me which I prefer), meat, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac and jalapenos.    I cannot understand anyone on the speaker at the drive thru, even when I ask to please speak slowly and clearly.... no more drive thru nachos for me."}
{"text":"Oh my god, there's a lot to love about Senor Taco.  First off, they have burritos the size of a newborn.   Second, they are open basically at the crack of dawn so if you are like me and want to go all out at 6am and order a newborn-sized breakfast burrito you have the liberty to do so.   Love you, Senor Taco, love you so much."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating at Senor Taco for over 5 years now and LOVE it!  My husband always gets the famous shrimp burrito and a fish taco.  The shrimp burrito is the BEST burrito ever!  Ask for extra sauce and it will be even more delicious.  The shrimp diablo burrito is also amazing if you like a little kick of spice to your food.  I have had other things on the menu and have never been disappointed but the shrimp burrito is our favorite.  Everyone we have brought to Senor Taco is also very pleased with their flavorful food.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We've been anticipating the opening of this new mexican food joint and we were not dissapointed. I ordered the shredded beef tacos and right off the bat I was impressed with how delicious they looked.  My husband ordered a Carne Asada  burrito and I swear it was the size of my four year olds head. My son got the kids quesadilla and even that was delicious! The wait was a little long, but hey I don't mind waiting for food as long as it tastes good! For two kids and two adults to eat and get stuffed it cost about $32.00."}
{"text":"So great for fast Mexican food,  the taste is fresh and flavorful.  I always stop on my way home from and I always order the shrimp tacos or burritos and they rock my face. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Can't say enough good things about the shrimp and fish being that I don't eat red meat but I'm more than sure you'll be happy if you're a meat eater as well. I love how late they're open and how consistently awesome they've been. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Food is good to ok. Doesn't blow my mind.  Slow as hell.  I can go down the street to Amado's and have food in less than 5 minutes. Trying to give this place a chance but it's not impressing me."}
{"text":"Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco?   Yes. Yes they do.  Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis?   Oh hell yeah!  Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells. When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say 'si' and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos. Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesn't get any better than this. Just make sure you put a helmet on because it's crazy good.  If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile).  If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates. The plate comes with flour tortillas, beans and rice, guacamole and salsa fresca. You make your own burritos. This is just good eatin'. Take it home, crack open a good Hefeweizen, and you are golden.  And lastly, from the sage words of my wife: \"The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals!\" Do I stutter? Nope.  While Senor Taco is technically 'fast food' it does take some time to prepare. If you do drive-thru don't get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell. There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME. This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs. Senor Taco is not that type of place. A little wait is very much worth it.  I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers. Yes, it is in a strip mall. Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market. I get that. But this is not Sanctuary. This is not Kai. This is not Deseo. When one reviewer (and I use the word 'reviewer' loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well... I just have to laugh. That's not a review, it's a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Luby's Cafeteria. And that's too bad because this is excellent fast food.  I've eaten here maybe 15-20 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick. The people at Senor Taco are nice, the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better. I can't recommend highly enough."}
{"text":"I had driven by this little taco shop a dozen times never bothering to stop until today and Im glad I did. Not only are the prices very reasonable but the food is great and I love their free salsa bar especially the red chili pepper oil. I ordered the Carnitas Burrito and went after the hottest stuff they had in the salsa bar and found it to be one of the best sauces Ive ever had on a burro. Wow - hot yet great flavor and unlike any sauce I have seen before basically oil on top with red pepper congregated on the bottom. The atmosphere is plain yet clean and the menu is very large. I asked and they recommend the surf and turf burro or shrimp burro so I will be back for that however I brought home some of that tasty spiced oil to try on my next meal. I will be back again with the family."}
{"text":"Back again for the 400th time. The lady I started out with their homemade guacamole and homemade tortilla chips which were DIVINE. She ordered tacos and I had a burrito myself. This place always goes above and beyond to make sure stomachs are properly full. Thanks again Senor Taco!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for the real deal Mexican food go to SeniorTaco.  If your looking for a place to eat late night go to SeniorTaco.  There's a reason these guys have been open since 1974.  Everything I get is good so I won't recommend anything in particular."}
{"text":"Been here three times now. Very slow service but good food. I ordered a breakfast burrito on my last visit at 10am (no breakfast or lunch rush) through the drive through with zero cars in front of me. Took 13 minutes to get my burrito. That's a long time to wait! That being said, the burrito was good, but not significantly better than Losbetos or Amados or the rest. I probably won't return but there is good food if you have the time."}
{"text":"Great fast Mexican food.  Love the rolled tacos!  Their burritos are great also."}
{"text":"I've intentionally whizzed by this place so many times thinking it would be like any RO/FIL/HUM,,,BERTOS (and I do like those places) but no,  not quite the same.   I've been missing out on a extra special stop in Fountain Hills and I get a kick out of imagining this establishment sticking its tongue out at me every time I did drive by. All I can report on is 3 things: rolled tacos, a Burrito and hot sauce.  The rolled tacos were awesome,,I don't know what they do different then 10,000 other establishments but they do something and its the best! Burrito Front = Our burrito was swaddled just so and so  big you think your dropping by the  maternity ward picking up your newly beloved and  you are in a way.  Hot Sauce, so good it tastes as if they grind up their own fresh spices to add to their salsas.  OLA Senor,,,can't wait to see/taste you again."}
{"text":"Had their fajita chicken burrito at noon today, and I'm STILL full fours hours later. I poured their tomatilo salsa over it, was awesome. Forgot how big their portions are. More bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Got the California Surfin burrito...outstanding!!!  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a great compliment. Great spot!"}
{"text":"When my order came out it wasn't what I ordered. I immediately told them I had ordered the #:6 on daily specials and the lady just said okay I waited and finally she went to the back and got what seemed to be the manager. The manager came out and just looked at me like what without saying anything. I told her I ordered the #:6 and didn't realize there were other number 6 combos. She said yes we have three differ we number 6's and left with the plate. If you know there are different combos with the same number please be proactive and ask your customers rather than letting these mistakes happen and then to top it off make your customers feel like they're annoying for wanting the food they thought they would be getting. Unprofessional, I hope you all learn and close this gap quickly before you treat other customers like crap because you can't number your combos past 6."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.... it has gone completely downhill, except for the prices.  It was $18 for   2 mini chimi 1 shredded chicken taco 3 rolled tacos Side of rice & beans  It took 25 mins to get our food.  The chimi's & chicken taco were soggy.  As in raw dough soggy. It was disgusting. ...  even worse, my husband dissected his chimi to try and salvage some of the meal, but found a short nasty hair in it.  Absolutely disgusting and we will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Every time I come there's always something wrong with our food. But we have no problem when we go to the other location on Estrella Parkway"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are GODLY!!! Huge, cheap, flavorful - combined with their fresh diablo or tomatillo salsa makes one of the best meals you can get. Better yet, they're served all day until late night closing!  Cheap, awesome Mexican food with a drive thru open as late as 3am, Senor Taco has always been worth the drive for me. From carne asada fries to shrimp tacos, I have eaten here dozens of times and have never had anything but great food.  There are various happy hour specials and deals to make your meal even more affordable. There is literally nothing on the menu over $10, and most is between $5-7.  My personal recommendations are limited to breakfast burritos since their classic menu is pretty damn good, but try either the Hash Brown burrito or the Chorizo and Egg. Heck, get the double wrapped Grande if you want to kill your stomach. The California Surfing burrito is also killer, shrimp and carne asada. Take the hit to your calories, because this place is probably the best Mexican I've had in miles."}
{"text":"The service here was abysmally slow and the overall flavor was not so good. It had this weird aftertaste like something was just not quite right. I would have been better off eating at Taco Bell, and I don't plan to come back to this place."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try since it's near by and I must say I wasn't impressed. They really are no different than all the others. I had a chimichanga and everything tasted bland, the salsa wasn't any different. I admit being from New Mexico I have high expectations for Mexican food this just didn't do it for me. Next time i'll just drive down the street to one of the others."}
{"text":"Boom goes the Taco Shop.  This is the only taco shop we'll eat at. Luckily we lived next to the one in Mesa and now near the one in Fountain Hills. Best part of this place are the beef tacos and their Mild red sauce. It's not mild.....and is so full of flavor. I buy the 8oz bowl all the time to keep in the house. I will not buy hot sauce anywhere else. Absolute YUM."}
{"text":"Haven't even had the food yet and I'm already Disappointed! It's hot and the ac is off! Customer service is bad! If you are in a diverse community make sure to have people that can clearly communicate! First time hear but won't be back!Haven't even got my food yet!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great tacos, love the beef tamales, the carnitas are delish and the staff is the nicest. Always quick, correct and a good $$. Check it out, you'll be pleased"}
{"text":"This place is a bit remote, but if your in the area se√±or taco isn't a bad choice. The menu is extensive with Mexican staples. The food was good tasting and not too heavy like a lot of Mexican can be. Oh, and do not forget to try the churros! They were amazing!"}
{"text":"Love breakfast tacos and anything else i have ever ordered from fish tacos to beef tacos. Always great however, they are not open as advertised . Locked up at 5:45am"}
{"text":"This is your basic fast food place. The food is outstanding. We ordered fish tacos that were supposed to be on flour tortillas but they were corn.  It was good but not what was ordered.  The reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 is due to the teeny tiny indoor seating area.  There is outdoor seating but you are subject to the elements and cars speeding past you at 45 MPH.  We had dinner here.  However, I would suggest that lunch is more appropriate."}
{"text":"We walked in and a smiling face greeted us. This was are first time here and the place was clean and the air conditioning worked good on this 112 hot day. My husband loved the fish tacos and a number 2 & 4 comb plates were delish. We will come back. Thank you for you friendly smiles and service."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this marvelous day to shout from the rooftops that: \" Se√±or Taco has been my favorite fast food Mexican joint in the valley for years. #$@%*!\" {woman screaming indecipherable expletives from rooftop}   Before the Tempe location popped up, I would sometimes drive 30 minutes into Fountain Hills just to get their veggie burrito. It could've been the nostalgia of growing up and being here hammered at 4am with my hood rat friends or the fact that they actually just make great Mexican food. The staff is friendly, the hot sauce is always plentiful and I hear that their Shrimp Diablo burrito is to die for. (Don't worry my source is reputable) I'd try it but I'd actually die. (Don't eat meat/seafood)  Anyways...there's a bunch of locations across the valley and I particularly like the Yelp Checkin but stopped using it because 1. I go so often and no one needs to see how many times I'm actually eating burritos alone in my car and 2. I'd rather that 10% of my money go to make sure they get paid and continue to feed me burritos.   Lastly, when I'm rich, I expect to have a Se√±or Taco in my house and then there will be burritos and rolled tacos and tostadas and margaritas and cerveza for all. Oh and don't forget the guacamole, it's green and delicious and I'll feed it to you with a spoon."}
{"text":"Good, quick texmex food. Quality ingredients, real cheese and always friendly service!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food our family has ever eaten including Mexico.  The owners are great, the place is immaculate and there is nothing that is not  SENSATIONAL!  We eat at the restaurant and do many drive-thrus and serve clients and friends.  They all love it.  Our sons discovered it when they were here for our youngests bachelor party.  They are still raving and coming back next week so they can religiously eat there!  Just finished our carnitas, there is no place in AZ that has better carnitas.  Every time is an amazing experience.  People like Jack F in Fountain Hills should restrain from writing negatives when its based on 5 years ago.  Not fair to such a great place.  HELLO....different owners, no negatives, an amazing place.  Sad to see people do that unfounded!  If you like Mexican this is your place!  LOVE IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Younger guy taking the order was a little snippy but he is very fast and efficient. We usually go to Amado's and I can easily say that this food is ten times better. Food was hot and fresh and they got it to us very quickly. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love the location of this neighborhood taco shop. Their menu is huge, and there's lots of different things to try for me each time I visit. I ordered the rolled tacos and the carne asada burrito with guacamole. Being my first time here, I didn't know how much food that would be, but for $7 or so I couldn't resist. My girlfriend ordered the veggie burrito.   The rolled tacos were excellent, perfectly fried, not too greasy. The salsa bar had a good variety of green and red sauces with varying spice levels. My carne asada burrito was huge with lots of meat and beans. The guac was just ok. The veggie burrito was much better in my opinion--I'll have to order it next time. All in all, a nice place with something for everyone. Price was right and they even had happy hour in the afternoon with great specials on beer and food."}
{"text":"Really good food, with great $6 specials. Can't beat it for value!  Make sure to go inside and look at the windows to see all the specials. There are more than what's just listed on the menu itself."}
{"text":"We discovered this place while vacationing nearby last week. My husband grew up in southern California and is always lamenting the lack of good Mexican food in Seattle, where we live now. He loved this place and we ate here 5 times in a week! The food is excellent, service is friendly and the restaurant is CLEAN. Bathrooms are clean, floors are always being mopped, and the salsa bar is well-maintained. Over the course of the week we saw all kinds of customers in here - families, elderly couples, teenagers, construction workers. Great food and comfortable, family-friendly ambiance! Wish they would open one of these in Seattle!"}
{"text":"This use to be a great place but since they made changes to their point of sale they can't get my order right. Everytime I go I order the same thing, it isn't complicated, bean, rice avacado burrito. Last time I got a bean and cheese burrito with avacado on the side. Each time it is wrong though and its difficult because I go through the drive through and don't check until I get home. You think if you spend 6 bucks and a bean rice and avacado burrito they can get it right."}
{"text":"So this is my second time at this establishment and boy am I beyond pleased! The food is amazingly delicious, the flavors and seasoning are authentic, the portions and price are perfect. I typically get my food to go and both times I've been beyond satisfied. The employees always seem happy that I'm there and never have had an order messed up when I got it home. And my food has always been piping hot even living 4 1/2 miles away. I also cant believe how delicious and satisfying their specials are. Sooooooo tasty! Best carne asada I've had in this area. You wont be disappointed coming to this location. Thanks for yet another great meal Senor Taco!"}
{"text":"My husband has been talking about this place for awhile now.  I ordered their Mini-chimi w/ 3 rolled beef tacos combo special which came with the drink. My husband ordered their 2 enchilada combo with beef and chicken which also came with a drink. We shared an order of chips to try their salsa bar. Overall, everything was great: food, serving, service and price. It didn't blow my mind to where I would be craving anything on the menu like my own personal favorite Mexican take-out place in downtown Phoenix so I gave a 4-star."}
{"text":"This place was clean, the menu looked OK, and the people at the register were nice. Unfortunately the food was just OK. The meat in my carnitas wasn't flavorful. Their green salsa was pretty good"}
{"text":"This place is great! Lovely women up front who smile and greet you and make you feel welcome.   The atmosphere was comforting & joyful. The smells were amazing and was generally quiet.    I had the rolled tacos with guac and cheese with tomatillo sauce! Muy bien! I loved this plate so much I licked the paper that it was on to get all the cheese and the guac. Lol   I would definitely eat here again, keep in mind this is the only location I've ever been to. So I can't speak for the other locations."}
{"text":"My husband I frequent this very intimate restaurant. We enjoy sharing the se√±or taco, which always leaves us with delicious leftovers. We have not found another Mexican restaurant around here with quality food and GREAT prices!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now, and simply must add a 5-star review! Besides the awesome shrimp burritos, delicious and diverse condiments, and friendly service, I've noticed that the clientele seems particularly happy.  And with good reason!    Tonight there were firefighters waiting for takeout, which reminds me to recommend that option if you don't have time to stay and eat in.  The menu extends far beyond shrimp, but the shrimp burritos are particularly juicy!    Totally worth making a turn off the main Beeline highway.    :-)"}
{"text":"service was horrible. walked in and smelled even though they were in the middle of cleaning up. drink came out wrong and server didn't even offer to fix it. ordered nachos - they were drowned with a pico that was nothing but onion and some tomato -- what i cud see of the carne asada on it was old and dried up. server new of my unhappiness and again offered nothing else. not even a sorry ."}
{"text":"Very basic Mexican restaurant. I'm not a mexican food person so I don't really know what \"authentic\" mexican food taste like, but they have decent carne asada burrito. Sometimes the meat can be very chewy and at other times it's very soft... Although I really like their carne asada fries.   Service is very straightforward, so don't expect amazing service."}
{"text":"I don't know where all of you eat that this food is good, but whatever floats your boat I guess. Meat is dry, everything is fried to hell and back. Our server completed ignored us as one of our party members actually had to go search her out. Interesting fusion concept, horrible delivery.  You couldn't pay me to eat here again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a quick bite of good Mexican food. I have always loved the ones in Fountain Hills, NE Mesa and the one in Litchfield Park area. The new one in Tempe on Baseline, just doesn't seem the same as the others. I feel I don't get enough bang for my buck, also the customer service doesn't seem as good and the food seems a bit bland compared to the others. My favorite thing on the menu is the Shrimp Diablo burrito."}
{"text":"YAAAAAS! Everything here is awesome. And I want to go on a food tour of their menu. I had the enchiladas and we also got burritos. Definitely check this place out its super yummy. Their horchata is great too and I believe it's made in house. Happy they're here! Four star review is simply because I sat at the drive through going \"hello?\" For about three minutes before someone bothered acknowledging me."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely subpar.  I ordered a hard shell shredded chicken taco, and it was unappealing.  It had no flavor, and the shells were soggy.  The chicken was flavored with salsa, but it tasted like it was flavored with some cheap tomato sauce. The rice and beans were unremarkable as well.  The only good thing about the meal were the chips.    Unbelievable to me how the Phoenix area is lacking in decent Mexican restaurants.  With such a large Hispanic population, I would think there would be a better selection."}
{"text":"Nice little gem of a taco shop. Big portions for little cash. Love the carne asada tacos. Only downside is the drive thru can take FOREVER."}
{"text":"Delicious. Authentic. Fast. Consistent. Friendly. Well priced. So happy to have 2 locations in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"The food here is ok...it's a hit or miss.  The service is what actually makes me only give 2 stars though. Tonight I was in the drive thru with 2 cars in front of me and waited a total of 17 minutes!  If it wasn't for the person behind me blocking me in and the person behind him, I would have left.  When I finally got to the speaker to order, it took forever for them to acknowledge me. I ordered and the guy repeated it back then ...... Nothing.  Me: \"that's all..thanks\". Them: .....nothing.  Me: \"hello?\". Them: \"ok yeah..pull up\".  You know....not sure if they're in a carb coma from the food or if they're high (or both) but...ugh...frustrating!  That long wait made me miss Seinfeld!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos! When your hungry for breakfast and don't feel like cooking up some eggs bacon and taters these guys deliver!"}
{"text":"I'll start this by saying I have been here on 4 separate occasions and every time I just get tacos.  No frills, no beans, rice, chips, etc.  I see those as pretty much just filler and I'd rather not.  So this is about their tacos... that being said I'd like to try their breakfast burrito sometime since its received such good reviews.   I have tried their carne asada, pollo, and fish tacos.  So far, my favorites are the steak and fish.  They are quite good, but I wouldn't say they're amazing.  They come double wrapped in corn tortillas (which I love) and a rather large helping of meat per taco.  I usually pound tacos like its my job but 2 is plenty for me here.  To me, on of the keys to a great taco is the cilantro, so I ask for extra and they heap it on!  The meat is pretty good, but I can see how some would call it bland.  It would be great if they spiced it on the grill.  The fish tacos are beer battered, but I have a feeling they are frozen.  So whatever, its a pretty good place for lunch, but I don't really want to try anything else on the menu as it looks pretty dang cheap.  Oh, and they do have a military discount, which is always a plus for me.  So, there you have it:  Good, but not great.  I've heard Don Pancho is the place to try.  Looking forward to my first taco there.  (Did I mention I love tacos?)"}
{"text":"Every time we go thru the drive thru. The guy that works the window always have a bad attitude like he doesn't want to be there. When we ask for green hot sauce he always seems irritated due to our request."}
{"text":"Expect to wait at least 10 minutes at the drive thru window. Food is good but pricy when you can literally drive one mile to filli b's for quicker service and same quality for cheaper. Stopped here because I live right next to here but waited over 15 minutes at the drive thru when I already paid or else I'd leave."}
{"text":"Im so glad they opened in this location. There isnt really any decent Mexican food around here except for this place. The shredded beef taco is delicious and fresh. Everything is fresh and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Great fast takeout. I live in Fountain Hills and find this place is faster then the one in town and I like the ride. Great Carnitas."}
{"text":"Good, quality, inexpensive Mexican food!!!!   A friend recommended Senor Taco to us a while ago and we've been coming here ever since.  All of the employees are friendly and helpful. You can order at their busy drive-thru, or stop in and order at the counter. Their fresh salsa bar is amazing   And, they have a Happy Hour where many items are half price!   Just go already, enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain!  Price is great, food is very good.  Authentic... Newly renovated.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Very tasty Mexican food. Economical and yummy. The chicken enchiladas are the bomb and the salsa bar has some unique stuff like spicy onions."}
{"text":"def one of the most authentic fast food places around. service is always a 10/10 and the food is at least a 9.5/10 every single time. i have never had a bad experience in any way shape or form. prices are pretty reasonable. a little more than the filiberto type places but the quality is way above and beyond!!! be wary of the one on estrella and the one on mcdowell though."}
{"text":"I just idled for SEVENTEEN minutes in the drive thru window at Senor Taco II location on Fountain Hills Blvd for ONE fish taco to be prepared to serve with the already cooked beans and rice to complete my dinner. The drive thru order taker Jonathan offered me nothing more than the smart ass smirk on his face  and the lame excuse that the order BEHIND me was \"really big\". When I asked for the manager on duty I was told it was Marlene, but she wasn't available. Must have been at Saguaro Lake catching the next fish for the order BEHIND me. Very, Very, Very good food at both Fountain Hills locations but why can't your management team work on the VERY, VERY, VERY poor service.  Train your personnel in customer service. Train Jonathan to save his smirk for someone who would appreciate his lack of charm and learn the words \"I apologize for your wait. I apologize my manager doesn't deem you as a value enough to speak with you about our lack of service.\" And then wonder why the pizza place next store to you will be your demise because they can service people ten fold to your pathetic pace."}
{"text":"Yum!  Went to the drive through on a whim when I was hungry and needed something quick.  Have been back since.  The burritos are large enough to share, even if you are hungry.  The tortillas are delicious!  The bean and cheese burrito very good.  I added sour cream and that was good the first time and not as great the second time as they layered it in a way that the cheese didn't melt.  The guacamole was something I skipped the second time."}
{"text":"I think I must have gone on an off night. The food was not good. The chicken was very very dry and slightly difficult to eat. It was fast and easy which was what we were looking for at the time but the food was unappetizing. The service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food.  Very filling.  Always fresh.  Pico degallo is best I've had.  I could eat cups full. Delicious.  Fresh.  Try their $6 menu. Eat here and always delicious."}
{"text":"Fountain Hills has some amazing Mexican food and Se√±or Taco is a personal favorite!! I highly recommend the enchiladas - chicken, beef, cheese - you cannot go wrong! They have great beans and rice. Plus, there's a drive-thru (actually, I've never been inside)!"}
{"text":"1st time here, visiting the area for the winter.  Drove all over looking for a Mexican restaurant that looked good. Stopped by another place first,  and there was no one in it, so I suggested we find another place to go. It's always a good sign when there are people eating.  So we found Senor Taco in a strip mall, and it was full. The menu was huge and very surprising, they serve everything from tacos to shrimp and breakfast. The portions are HUGE, we ordered 2 of the specials thinking there was only 3 items on the plate and we were wrong, and it had 6. I could only eat 1 taco. Not knowing the portions were so big and being really hungry we also got chips and guacamole with cheese.  OMG, they were awesome, fresh homemade chips piled high covered with really good guacamole.  Needless to say for a little over $20.00 we were stuffed and it was good.   The reason for 4 stars is because it took some time to get your food and the ambiance was not too great. We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The burritos are delicious and their service is great! I highly recommend the diablo shrimp burrito, their chips are good as well. We usually order off Uber eats and I have never been disappointed. I look forward to trying their fish tacos."}
{"text":"Well, I was just done working & on my way home, when I decided that I deserved a quick snack. I checked the internet for the best Taco Tuesday deals in Tempe, and Se√±or Taco popped up - and just a few blocks away. I entered with low expectations, just hoping to grab a few street tacos. I ordered two tacos suaves, one carnitas and one al pastor. What came out was more of an entr√©e than a snack! Amazing pork 2-ways, and the carnitas version was more of a hemi-burro! Both were covered with minced white onion & cilantro and encased within a pair of perfect corn tortillas. Tortilla chips were included. Typical pickled/prepared onions, carrots, & Jalapenos were at the condiment bar with routine salsas. The green was spot-on for these tacos, and they offered a unique condiment similar to Asian chili oil, but made with what I think was ground chile de arbol - Yikes! And when I complimented the cook & thanked the staff, they nonchalantly acted as though to say, \"¬øDe qu√©?\" - this is just our normal fare. MY ADVICE: EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service.  I went through the drive through at lunch and literally sat there an stared at my food for close to ten minutes before they opened the window.  Mexican food gets soggy relatively quickly so I said something.  I said \"is that my food, because I have been staring at it for ten minutes\"  The guy said \"no you have not\".  Actually, I HAD.  It was exactly 9 minutes.  He then told me \"I don't need your complaining, if you don't like it go eat somewhere else\"  I was pretty stunned as this is company that claims it takes pride in its restaurant since 1974.  So I went in to talk to the manager, and she actually defended his rudeness.  When I told her I was going to post a negative review, she told me to \"Go For it\"  So here it is, for all the world to read.  This place does not value their customers and clearly hire management not fit to handle upset customers."}
{"text":"Open 24hrs, Senor Taco (Famous for the Shrimp Burrito) is a must stop.  The Diablo shrimp burrito is to die for, Lunch or Dinner. Ham & Cheese Quesadilla's for breakfast are great (Ask them to mix in a few Jalapenos with the ham).  All my friends drool whenever they come over cause they want to stop."}
{"text":"This place somehow was flying under my radar. It is down the street from my house, so I decided to try it, since I'm always driving by.  Glad I did!  The ugly yellow sign reading \"Se√±or Taco\" on the building is a scare tactic. It has to be lol because that cheesy sign is the reason I didn't try this place sooner.   However, the brave few who ignore the tacky exterior are rewarded with surprisingly delicious and cheap Mexican food that gives Filiberto's a serious lesson in quality and service.   5-Star in its class. Huge portion sizes, super tasty authentic Mexican fast food. Great salsa Verde! Won't hurt your wallet. It's a WIN. They don't skimp on anything. Perfect hangover meal, or just a quick Mexican food fix. Andale pues, don't be scared, just try it!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times during the first week of Senor's Tempe debut, and let me tell you these burritos are bigger than King Kong's fingers.... Was excited to hear about Senor's Tempe opening after frequenting some of the other valley locations a number of times over the years, and they did not disappoint. I've personally witnessed companions of mine conquer the 2 pound Surf&Turf burrito (that's an exaggeration), A bean and cheese that'll put Nana MiMi's to shame, as well as a hashbrown burrito straight from the hypothetical lord himself. Whether you're in for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, Senor is bound to have something delicious to fit your needs. There has been some big crowds packed inside the small restaurant but they seem to pump burrito volume at a quick and consistant pace.   The only downfall would be the confusion that some of the cashiers have with their own menu (which is completely understandable within the first week of opening). This includes looking at you with a blank stare on their face asking \"um is that on the menu?\" after receiving a food order. But the 5 star rating will remain 5 stars, because ultimately, we are coming here for tasty Mexican food (the cashier can kidnap my puppy and steal my girl for all I care, as long as the cooks are manufacturing abnormally large burritos they deserve the 5 star rating)."}
{"text":"Found this place a few years ago and still coming back.  I love the fish tacos. Clean restaurant, great prices."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was that good. Filibertos blows this place away. Meat and beans have zero flavor. The only good thing was the salsa bar and the chips. The rice was okay but the enchiladas were terrible. The beans needed something, salt maybe? Sadly, I will be writing this one off my list."}
{"text":"This place is better than all the 'Bertos & Salsitas combined, especially when hammered at 1am. It's f-ing amazing. You might crap your pants afterward due to the massive size of their burritos but it would be worth it. So don your adult diapers and go to town!"}
{"text":"The best shrimp tacos.  Lots of big plump shrimp in each taco and the sauce on the taco is yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and the food is pretty good. Everything on the menu is pretty typical of a Mexican joint. It's a little bit more expensive than most something something bertos places. But it's worth it, because it's fresher and lighter. It's like Mrs. Chipotle and Senor Bertos forgot the gloves and give birth to Senor Taco. Thank you for joining me at the Food Porn channel. See you next time!   Buy surf and turf burrito."}
{"text":"Love senor taco. Both locations here in town are great. Great prices and always delicious. My favorite is the California surfing burrito chimichanga style! Love it!"}
{"text":"Service and quality have declined on my last few visits to FH location (over the past year or so).  Still pretty good."}
{"text":"Really good Filberto-esque Mexican food. Ok, maybe a *bit* more dressed up than Fili-B's :) As far as drive-thru Mexican places go, this is certainly near the top of the list.  The one complaint I would lodge is that the drive-thru times have been a bit long. Perhaps it's because this is a new location, perhaps they should work on improving their systems. With that in mind, believe me the food is very much worth the wait.  p.s. Some of the best horchata in town, hands down."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice, both times were a good experience. Went through the drive thru was surprise of the amount of food, very generous.  Second trip was also great, the food is tasty and filling. The help was courteous and helpful. Will go here again and again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Senor Taco already?! I had to look back to confirm this. After all, I've only eaten here more than a few times. So clearly, I really enjoy the offerings of this \"fast food\" chain.  I use quotes because Senor Taco has no business referring to its menu as fast food.  The dining room is set up similar to a fast food joint, but the cushioned booths are way more comfortable than the hard plastic in most \"Fill-In-The-Blank-Bertos\". And the prices are very reasonable and appropriate for a fast food chain.  But the primary reason I would argue for a change in marketing, is the quality and portions of the food. Seriously, my first impression (years ago) was, \"They aren't charging enough for this!\" A combo with two tacos, rice and beans was way more than I could handle. The rice is solid, but the beans are to die for. You just know when you taste homemade refried beans. They are better than some sit down places I've been.  And the tacos were huge! I loved my Carne Asada taco with the fresh guacamole and pico de gallo! I had to force myself to eat the delicious shrimp taco with its crema sauce. Kudos to the hardcore salsa bar too. Do you like hot peppers?! I'm talking \"jalape√±os are for wimps, have a Serrano\" pepper! But you can cool it off with some pickled onions too.  Thank you Senor Taco for being consistently delicious! And thanks for the generous portions and reasonable prices. But you can stop calling it \"fast food\" already!"}
{"text":"A great new Taco shop in the old Jack in the Box building on the s.e.c. of Baseline and McClintock.  My wife ordered the fish taco it was freshly prepared with great flavor and excellent pico de gallo inside.  I ordered a bean tostada and rolled tacos which came with guacamole also very good.  They have a nice little salsa bar which included giant spicy carrots and 3 tasty salsa's.  The staff was friendly and very well composed despite being very busy.  The wait was not long at all considering how busy they were.  They also have a drive thru great if you hate getting out of your car."}
{"text":"Super yummy breakfast burritos. Im a loyal fan of a simple egg, potato, and cheese. They are so big I usually eat half for breakfast and the other half for lunch. By the time I eat the piece for lunch I swear it tastes even better!"}
{"text":"$40 for for 2 Tortas and 2 kids Tortas?? Holy shit this place is expensive. I can get a family meal at pollo loco for under $20 with a lot more food than this."}
{"text":"Love this place. The portions are huge and can easily feed two people or you can save half for later. My favorite things to get here are the carnitas plate and the chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla is practically a burrito because it is so big. I Love the green salsa and put it on everything. Definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Yummy food at a great price.  Clean restaurant.  LOVE the beef tacos!!"}
{"text":"The people here need costumer service training!  Also, the food isn't that great - not authentic Mexican food at all."}
{"text":"For a fast food mexican resturant this place is awesome.  Senor Taco is several steps above the always popular Filibertos in terms of flavor. A lot of this is from how great the fresh tortillas taste and the many salsa options. I really like their shrimp burrito since it's loaded with a lot of shrimp. Bean burritos, beef tacos, chicken enchiladas, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Reasonably Priced Food and Generous Portions.  Se√±or Taco is a favorite of a friend of mine who has two children ages 9 and 12.  Se√±or Taco might not be one of my favorite eating establishments but the food at Se√±or Taco is reasonably priced and the serving sizes are very generous.   Se√±or Taco has a  small condiment bar. I really enjoy the salsa bar with all the different types of salsa's and hot carrots.  The  burrito  I ordered was good and as I mentioned, a very generous  serving size, large enough to take some home.   Se√±or Taco offers a variety of entr√©es to order from and the customer service is second to none.  No pretense just come in, order, sit down and enjoy."}
{"text":"Mediocre food that took well over 30 minutes to get. I wasn't the only one that night. Most people left pretty pissed. Maybe it was an off night, but I felt like I've had way better food from Chipotle and some chain restaurants for the same price and in a reasonable time frame.  Skip this place and keep looking!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! As the name suggests, Mr. Taco delvers the goods! There are many fast service Mexican style restaurants in the Phoenix area. Probably one of the many things that keeps me in this glorious state. My wife and I generally go to nicer sit down places, but when you are craving fast delicious Mexican, this is the place to go. This go around I got the taco combo and she got the enchiladas. We were in and out in 20 minutes for under 20 bucks, stomachs full and smiles on our faces. Will be back probably sooner then latter."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this place I was recommended by one of my friends. If you have not tried this place you need too. Amazing food to say the least, I had the hash brown breakfast burrito without sausage or bacon. But they put something extra in their burritos. You have to go to check it out."}
{"text":"Well, this will probably be a mandatory stop every time we head to the Payson area or visit Fountain Hills. This is like a fast food Mexican place, with very affordable prices, decent portions and delicious food.  This time we tried the #10 Chipotle Fish taco special (2 tacos and a drink), the plate that includes 2 quesadillas and 3 rolled tacos (we call them 'flautas'), and I had to try the menudo as well. Yes, I know. I had food for like 2 days.  I was super impressed with the tacos, for only $5 I got 2 massive tacos with double corn tortilla (badly needed because I could not fit all that into one tortilla). They were super tasty with plenty of chipotle dressing.  At first I was not impressed with the menudo bowl, which looked kind of empty, but upon tasting it, it was very good and had a great ratio of meat and hominy (lots of meat and minimum hominy). Although it probably would not have been very filling on its own, I would have needed 2 bowls which would have been kind of steep at $7 each.  Overall very good food and friendly service. They have a salsa bar."}
{"text":"Update:  The menudo soup is a 4 or 5 stars depending on the day.  The carne asada tortas hardly had any meat in it compared to other places which give you plentiful portions.  So this was a let down.  Nachos are okay.  The flan is very good.  Their beer battered fish tacos are killer!  Only $2.49.  Unbelievable price."}
{"text":"Excellent food with large portion sizes and very polite employees. You will leave with your stomach full and not spend a lot."}
{"text":"I like this place, especially for lunch. Their combos offer a lot of food at a good price.   I've eaten here at least 5-7 times, and every time the staff takes my order quickly, the food arrives in a reasonable amount of time, and it tastes fresh.  No. it's not a high end Mexican restaurant, it's fast food, but done well, at a great price-point."}
{"text":"I am shocked that thisplace  has such good ratings!  It is the worst Mexican food that I have ever had.  I ordered the surf and turf burrito, enchilada style.  I cut into the burrito and I almost vomited the odor was so strong and BAD.  The beef looked as if it were cooked two weeks ago, dried out and hard.  At least everything must have been cooked and the bacteria killed because I fully expected to get sick and did not.  The sauce on the burrito was very good and that was my dinner, mostly rice and sauce.  For my husband and myself our check was a little more than $20.00  Next time I will go to Chipotle Mexican Grill for GREAT food at the same price. Will definitely NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Just not really impressed by this place... I like tacos like all other red blooded Arizonians BUT eh... I've had better. This was nothing more than another Mexican-American Fast food place Also I was surprised this was pretty pricey in my opinion especially since you can get the same thing at any of the million \"___bertos\" drive thru taco joints and cheaper (Filbertos,Humbertos,Losbertos, etc.) ... ;-( Sorry Senor, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I come here so much for many reasons, but of course the main reason... IT IS DELICIOUS!  My only regret this very moment is I have not been taking pictures of all the foods I have tried from here. I tend to do take out, because this location is near my job so I tend to do a pick for a few people and lose track of my food picture taking. So what I will do is tell you about the foods I have tried:  Bean and cheese burrito - the tortilla is soft (possibly homemade) the beans are cooked perfectly and the cheese is fresh  Chicken flautas with rice and beans - rolled tacos are crunchy as expected, the chicken is tender and you can tell freshly made everyday, guacamole has right amount of seasoning and made with fresh avocados (i know I'm an avocadoholic I have the shirt to prove it) lol Surf n turf burrito - Wow the combination of the carne asada with the shrimp is perfect! Their chipotle sauce gives it an excitement of taste. I ask to have the French fries on the side instead of inside the burrito and it also has their tasty guacamole inside Shrimp tacos - sooo good the shrimp is very fresh and they have deals on their fish and shrimp tacos on Wednesdays  Those are the only things I have tried so far, but as I try more I will update and I will also promise to get pictures next time. OH and the cashier is always super friendly and the service is fast and efficient considering I will go in ordering a minimum of 5 different orders."}
{"text":"Pros: Despite the slow speed, the service was friendly.  Cons: - absolutely terribly slow service. We waited in excess of 20 minutes for our food.  2 fajita burritos. That's ridiculous, and there is no excuse for it. The restaurant wasn't full."}
{"text":"Fast food Mexican without fast food taste.  Oh wait, it's not fast food, they serve beer, so is this casual Mexcican restaurant with convenient drive through? Whatever it is, I like coming here for a quick meal.  Fish tacos, shrimp tacos, shrimp tostada,... Trying to think what else I ordered before... Whatever I had from here, I am pleased with the food I ordered. I am not a Mexican food expert but I eat here or another one near the Safeway in Fountain Hills just about once a month.  Always friendly and fast service. It is just so pleasant to dine there with their friendly smiles.  10% off with Yelp check in. I think they also have senior discount (a person behind me was told about it but not sure the % discount).  A few times a year, they support a local school by offering a senor taco day where 10% of sales goes to a local school. I always like to support business where they support local school and community. I heard this coming Friday is another senor taco day and guess where I will be for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken mini chimis and quesadilla.  The chimi was full sized and had a chicken and beans mixture as filling. I ordered \"mini.\" This definitely is not the same,  if you've ever had mini chimis.  Also, the medium red salsa, which we've been eating here for years, has changed. Too much vinegar and more watery."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Fountain Hills.  My go to is the breakfast burrito (hash brown).  It is HUGE and tasty with sour cream, hash browns, sausage, bacon, egg, cheese.  Wrapped tightly and easy to eat while driving!  Need to go back and try their fish taco or the veggie burrito.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Had this place for the first time today....where has this place been my whole life?? I ate it for breakfast I didn't eat anything else till dinner"}
{"text":"Food was OK I had street tacos in the lot any seasoning I had a hard time telling between the Carnitas in the   Asada tacos. I think the most disappointing was the wait 20 minutes for for tacos and very unfriendly service."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I have been here three times and all three times have been outstanding. I love carne asada, and Senor Taco has some of the best. Super big burros and tacos that put other tiny street tacos costing about the same to shame! The Carne Asada Red Chile burro w/beans was one of the best burros I have ever had. Do your self a favor and order one. And one is all you'll need as they are BIG! Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have dreams about the surf and turf diablo burrito. It's the best."}
{"text":"Senor Taco has one of the few items I could eat every meal for the rest of my life. The California Surfin burrito is phenomenal, if you haven't tried it you simply must. Friendly staff that always remembers you and makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I'm glad to find this new (to me) place. I always drive by this place on my way to work but this morning, I decided to try for the first time. Their tacos are pretty damn amazing, with fresh onions and fresh meat, i am drooling as i am writing this  and their enchilada sauce is also on point.   I forgot about this draft since i first visited like 3 months ago and i have made numerous visits ever since, and every time, i never encountered a problem and quality and portion of food is always constant. If i were to add a minor complaint, pricing on the dine in menu, drive thru menu and togo menu is different for some items and it is confusing. They had taco tuesday specials for fish taco but actually they are the same price every day and also specials for 2 enchilada for $5.99 with a side of beans and rice, but if you order drive thru, enchiladas are sold seperately (without the sides) for $5.99. Aside all that, this my favorite mexican food in town and price is way cheaper than most mexican places in Tempe."}
{"text":"Best Drivethrough tacoshop anyplace! They have a really nice assortment of salsas and I love the deep fried salted freshJalapenos.  This is a good place for chicken tacos to go. I really think that this may be the best place to eat in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food spot. I've been a huge fan since I lived in Mesa 7 years ago. When I moved to Scottsdale I was excited to see another location in fountain hills. Diablo shrimp burrito is my persona favorite. They are very generous with their portion sizes and always use fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"well, Se√±or Taco... I am convinced you're doing the Lord's work. It was love at first bite as I graced my face with the tortilla ladened with carne asada steak, some white cheese, pico de gallo, french fries and sour cream. As an avid fat ass who really enjoys his food, particularly california burritos, I'd like to think i know what the fuck im saying here, ok? I have had the California burritos at every filibertos, erickbertos, ramiros, wahoos, etc. you name it, ive had it. Now, like pizza.. hard to fuck this one up.. but also like pizza, some can be better than others. i dont pay attention to parking, location, what the shit on the walls says, or even bathroom quality. its all about the food, and if you want unforgettable food at a forgettable location, come to Se√±or Taco and get some shit. Also, havent taken a shit yet.. but its been 5 hours since i ate and i havent had the secret spray farts yet, so i think im in the clear! bravo, senor taco, bravo."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Extremely quick service, and plenty of versatile options for vegetarians. The portions are large, and the prices are great! I ordered an enchilada and taco combo, which came with beans and rice. The food wasn't anything extra ordinary to me, but I did appreciate their salsa bar. I wish their \"rolled tacos\" (aka taquitos) had been vegetarian. They have a drive-thru for quickness. Personally, I prefer Taco Bell to this place for fast mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent food  Great quality  Huge portions  The restaurant on Fountain Hills Blvd Rocks!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican joint. Carne Asada fries are the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Award winning breakfast burritos!  Well, maybe not, but they are damn good! Get the Breakfast burrito and add potatoes and you will be happy.  They have amazing green salsa on the salsa bar.  Any place with a salsa bar deserves at least 4 stars in my humble opinion.  You'll probably want to go inside and get your order to go as opposed to going through the drive through so you can get as many little plastic cups of salsa as possible.  That's my strategy at least.  They also have really delicious bean burritos.  I've tried just about every bean burrito in Tempe and these are by far the best."}
{"text":"Nice clean place with good food.  Shrimp burrito - pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We decided to order two fish tacos and a veggie burrito today. The veggie burrito is always amazing but I was very dissatisfied with the fish tacos since one of them was only filled half of the way. Despite the fact that they were still amazing it is unfortunate that you pay for a product only to receive half of it. This is not the first time this has happened to me nor the first item that has happened to me with."}
{"text":"I am a lover of Mexican food and have tried many places across the Valley; this joint is awesome.   I had their fish tacos, and they were well-prepared and delicious. Their salsa bar was also very nice. What I appreciated most was that they are not stingy with portions. They included large chunks of beer-battered fish in my fish tacos (which the tortillas weren't even able to hold).  I wasn't a big fan of their rice, but everything else made up for it. I will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food made me and my brother both sick I don't know what kind of meat they put in there tacos but it wasn't beef"}
{"text":"Just move to FH and a lot of the locals told us about this place.  It did not disappoint either!  I had the fish taco's and my Wife had the taco salad.  Very good!  Cheap too!"}
{"text":"This place just gave me the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my life!! The shrimp burrito did it to me, awful!! Nonstop vomiting, and stomach issues I will not mention for the past 2 days, and still not over it. It would be interesting to see what kind of health inspection report this place would get. Stay away, or you will be sorry."}
{"text":"Since moving here from Chicago I have been on a quest for a great Burrito. Polibertos put eggs in my Carne Asada burrito, Vaquero's...ok, Rilibertos....meh, Filibertos , hit or miss, Someburros, tiny, TC Taco, the smallest and you get to pay $10 for a burrito with a grand total of 4 things in it. Then I found Senor Taco. As others have said, open early so that's great. Burrito is awesome. I can order online and its ready when I go pick it up (Patron app) And they also have a bunch of great other selections besides my staple Carne Asada. California Burrito being one. Girlfriend loves their street tacos and at $1.50, that's hard to beat. Highly recommend them. Oh and they have churro's with this delicious filling in them, kind of like the filling in those McDonalds hot apple pie's. Never had a churro like that before. Unexpected but very good."}
{"text":"Good Lord, this place is so good.  Found this little gem a year ago while visiting my In-laws who live in Fountain Hills.  They had not yet discovered this place but have since been converted to addicts like me...  Whenever I'm in town I eat here for as many meals as I can... Breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night (they are open til like 4 AM!).  Don't be fooled by the modest location and exterior.  This place has top notch, authentic & very fresh mexican food.  From the carnitas (yum) to the carne asada (awesome) to their fish & shrimp offerings, everything I've had there is delicious.    Very generous portions from their entrees (their burritos are almost as big as my forearm) to their kids meals (the rolled chicken tacos are fantastic and very filling).  The surf & turf burrito is my current favorite but it's hard to stay away from the shrimp or fish tacos...  You can go ahead and skip Taco Bell because this place is the real deal for about the same price.  By the way, they also serve ice cold bottled beer if you are craving a Corona with your meal...  I love this place so much, I had a picture of me holding one of their burritos as my Facebook profile for a long time...  Can't wait til I can go back on my next visit there!"}
{"text":"I love Senor Taco!!! I have been eating here since they opened and have never had a bad experience. The people that work here are friendly and the food is great. I really like their carnitas tacos and the special they have with a beef tamale, 3 rolled tacos and a drink for $6.95. They also have some good salsas in their salsa bar. I have heard they make great fish tacos and seafood burritos!!   You also must try their cinnamon treats!!"}
{"text":"The steak tacos are the best in town, only place I have had better is a dive on Fremont Street in Vegas. The rest of the food was above average but the steak is excellent"}
{"text":"The beef tacos are my favorite! They are huge! The drive through is a little slow but that's to be expected with something so good. Giving it 3 stars because it's a little pricey but the food is good!"}
{"text":"I love me some good Mexican food and I have to say Senior Taco is one of my favorites, but this location sucks! The food is way to greasy, the service is POOR and the atmosphere is not welcoming at all! If you want good Senior Taco food, service, and an inviting atmosphere head west to the location off Estrella south of the 10!!! Way better for sure!"}
{"text":"Every Friday night this is what we get at home!! HUGE California burrito for me and I LOVE IT!! Homemade tortillas, lots of food for an excellent price. I need my Senor Taco fix every week! YUM!! Great prices, lots of food... Mmmmm... I'm craving it now!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what you get. The food is good just not great. I don't know why they are so much more expensive then their competitors in the area."}
{"text":"Save your time and money.  Went at 10:25pm, 35minutes before closing.  They might as well just close at 10.  Half the items you try and order they don't have, including salsa.  The answers from the lady was that they are closing.  Well if you don't have half your menu and then just close.  Food we did get was cold and thrown together.  Beans had the dried crust around it, chicken taco had weird flavor.  Ended up throwing away half the order. Long story short, keep it moving, might as well go to Taco Bell.  Oh yeah, 18 minute wait in drive thru for one car ahead of me."}
{"text":"Great spot for burritos and the works but a little pricey! 2 burritos cost close to $16."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. A step up from a Something-plus-bertos. I had a combo that included a chicken  quesadilla and I can't recall if it was a taco or tostada or what. I liked it. I am sure I will be back at some point with it across from my regular Target. I wouldn't make a point of going, but it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"This is receipt for on burrito. I've been waiting 12 mins   Not fast food   Did not taste good. Will not go there again"}
{"text":"If you have to eat in a pinch go for it...nothing special but I would eat there again if in need for fuel.  But not even close to some taco's from Mexico or So-Cal :) Nom nom nom nom"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.... maybe 4  Forget about any of the other fast food Mexican food joints.  The \"Ricos\", \"Bertos\"...  Taco Bell... etc.   This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food. The beans are great!  The rice isn't bad and the burritos are huge!    We've eaten there twice and the first time around everything was a hit. No issues with the food or the service.  The second time around... the food was still pretty good. The grilled chicken nachos were pretty greasy. the chicken... although flavorful was fatty and this set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Wasn't horrible.. just could have been better.    Do drop in and give this place a try. It isn't expensive... and you better bring an appetite....as mentioned... the portions are huge.   We will go back. Hatch"}
{"text":"my friends and i went here after a long day out and it definitely hit the spot.  their hashbrown burrito and their carne asada burrito is to die for.  it's tucked away behind the gas station and definitely worth the search"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout.... I think it's good for a Mexican place. However I was not blown away with the food quality or taste.  a lot of great reviews for this restaurant... I did not go in I just ordered takeout. But it wasn't that much better then a fast food Mexican place.  If you have a craving for fast Mexican food that is decent and then you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Love, love Senor Taco!! Love the fact that my food is always tasty and piping hot, and stays consistent. Also, gotta love the late hours and friendly service.   Plus, if you don't feel like dining in, you can always swing through their drive-thru..."}
{"text":"My family and I used to eat here quite often, but after today no more. We ordered 3 orders of beef rolled tacos and an enchilada. The rolled tacos are pretty simple to make. The tortillas were overcooked and the beef had gristle mixed in. Yuk! Had to stop eating it, we lost our appetites. On top of that, the beef had fat mixed in. I almost threw up. Needless to say, that will be the LAST time we eat here. Time to find another Mexican eatery nearby."}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat Mexican food this would be the place the closest thing I can say around the area of Litchfield Park that has decent Mexican food not the best but not the worst I would still continue to go"}
{"text":"Senor Taco is a cozy little place, and very clean. The ambiance is nice, and the employees are friendly.  My friend and I arrived at just the right time, because minutes after our arrival there were like 3 or 4 families that walked through the door. (I noticed that none of them waiting long to receive their order.)  I ordered combo #14: Two chicken flautas. It came with rice and beans, but no drink. I thought it was very tasty, especially after dressing it with salsa from their salsa bar. I was also pleased to see carrots that have been soaked in jalapeno juice. Moreover, their flour tortillas didn't taste like crappy store-bought tortillas that are full of preservatives. Still, they didn't completely taste homemade.  If you're looking for fast food Mexican that isn't crappy like Taco Hell or Jack in the Crack, I recommend giving Senor Taco a try!"}
{"text":"Tried out Uber eats and Senior Taco for the first time.  Was so good that we decided to try them again.   Order the same thing as the first time and it was horrible.  My cheese enchiladas were not cooked.  The cheese looked like they rolled it and plopped it into the to go container. Completely disgusting. The beans were completely runny and tasted blah. We got the order to go so by the time we got home - I was not about to go back and get it replaced.   Really disappointed.  Only reason for the two stars is because my son liked his quesadilla."}
{"text":"I went for the chipotle bacon egg breakfast burrito and didn't look back! It was damn tasty and their selection of salsas are good. I was visiting for a wedding so I'll probably never be back in Fountain Hills, but if I am I know where I'm stopping!"}
{"text":"When this place first came to Chandler someone told me senor taco had the best breakfast burritos. They also had chilaquiles that were decent but were a little crunchy for my taste. The burritos were a good size for the price i got the sausage egg and cheese but it was sausage links instead of ground sausage. Later someone told me their hashbrown burrito is delious"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how yummy this place was! Delicious food at a good price. Carne Asada Fries were great and not greasy. This is so close to home too! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is hot unless you order cheese enchiladas...the cheese was not melted.  The flavor is great, the enchilada sauce is very good, not out of a can. Very fresh.  Beans are good and so is the rice (staples in my opinion).  The restaurant is clean, smells good and has music playing. The staff could use some smiles, thanks.  Being friendly with your patrons is crucial ladies.  Location is close to my work so I'll write more as I try new things.  Yep, only thing missing is the happy workers."}
{"text":"I love eating here! Never once had I had a bad encounter with the employees. The food is amazing! My fave thing to get is the carne asada nachos. Definitely a top go to place for easy and relatively inexpensive Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've eaten Carne Asada burritos 6 times in six days.  Also tried the  California Burrito.  Very good. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Went they the drive thru ordered a burrito and 2 tacos.  Asked for extra hot sauce,  drive home and there were 2 in the bag.  Even asked at the window when paying for the meal.  Still no hot sauce.  Also was close to $20 for average food truck food.  I'd say over priced and not interested into customer service."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Our favorites are the shrimp enchiladas, the chicken fajita quesadillas or the steak fajita quesadillas and the California fries with steak and shrimp! The picture I'm posting is of the shrimp enchiladas with rice and beans and the other picture is the California fries! Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"This is a genuine mexican food place with drive through. Not to be confused with taco bell. Burritos are huge and really good."}
{"text":"Fountain Hills sucks. It sucks to work in, I can't imagine living there. I work in FH in a place that is so slow we don't hire enough people to let us all just leave for lunch. So for the first time I was allowed, I pulled up my buddy Yelp and looked for ANYTHING to eat around me. The only thing that was unique was senor taco, I liked that they had a menu online so I check it out and decide from there.   When I got there, they were quite busy, and there was a really nice guy behind the register, I was just looking for something without onions and he directed me to the red chili carnitas burrito. They have a salsa bar and I LOVE green salsas but its hard to find done the way I like it, and they have perfected.   I took the burrito to go and I really enjoyed it, I thought it was gonna be like Filberto's quality but it wasn't, it wasn't gourmet either, just a good meat filled burrito."}
{"text":"Fast food that tastes homemade! I love this place for a quick meal after a full day of working / working out! I'm not gonna lie, I consider Senor Taco a \"cheat\" meal. They don't have the healthiest options, but the food tastes fresh and the service is good! Cruise through and order a \"make your own\" breakfast burrito...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"LOVE! Stumbled on this place when I was getting gas in Fountain Hills the other day. It was lunch time and appeared super busy.  WAIT - so did McDonald's, and I never run back to try it when I see it's busy... Um, let's see, why did I want to go back \"super busy\" really isn't a good enough reason.  It was super busy AND it looked cute AND it was convenient to our house. There, that makes me feel better.  Okay, so my hubby and I finally ventured out and north up the Beeline for the first time since we've been here. On the way home, we filled up with gas and decide to give Senor Taco's a try. It was tasty. Hubby had tacos, which had quite a bit of meat, and I had the chille relleno and cheese enchilada combo. Mine was good, but would have been better if the chile relleno was beef instead of cheese - two cheese items on the plate didn't make sense to me.   Lots of salsa options that were really good.   There definitely will be a next time. Next time I'm going with the beef tacos for sure."}
{"text":"The mixed chicken and bean special for $6 is awesome! It's plenty of food they have nice, friendly service. Check out their selection of salsa and marinated peppers all complimentary of course! Great patio sitting although the view of baseline isn't much of a view ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast burrito! The potatoes in it were raw and more beans then meat! First time there! It might have just been a bad cook!"}
{"text":"When we pulled up to the Senor Taco in Fountain Hills, located in a run-down strip mall behind a Circle K, the 1st thing I noticed was the trucks.  The parking lot (what there is of it) was full of big trucks with construction looking tools and equipment on the backs.  I thought, \"this is a good sign.\"  The restaurant has gone through an interior upgrade, so the formica booths and tile floors are clean, but not much more.  You walk to the cashier and place your order (or use the drive thru).  It comes up in about 5 minutes.  The prices cannot be beat.  We ordered the fish taco plate and got two huge tacos in fresh corn tortillas with cabbage and fresh crema.  The rice and beans are awesome but never quite hot enough (that's why they only get 4 *).   My husband and I can get ONE platter and split it all for $6.99.  The prices on everything are reasonable and the flavors are authentic.  The folks that eat here know their mexican food.  They have a self serve salsa bar with your usual salsas, and my favorite, pickled carrots and fresh radishes.  Yum.   It aint fancy, but it's cheap, quick and delish."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Get the 2 fish tacos. Very filling...only could eat one had leftovers. But they don't have tapatio*! We're in az!!! Can't wait to go back and try the rolled tacos"}
{"text":"A taco-licious update! I've tried a few more items off their menu and have found some favorites: Their California burritos, chilaquiles, and their regular and rolled tacos. Service is friendly and I love the various salsas and condiments you can choose from at the salsa bar. The drive through is a very convenient option. I wish they were open later though. Upgrade one star!"}
{"text":"I did the drive thru and there were no customers so it was quick for me to pull up. The drive thru cashier was kind of rude, but not too much. I ordered the pollo asado burrito and it came out fast. I got it home and ate it and it was pretty good. The only thing is that it is very similar to other Mexican food places like Filibertos."}
{"text":"Generic-fill-you-up-on-the-cheapest-bulk-ingradients-we-can-find-in-the-clearance-section-of food-city-kinda-of-meal."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 quesadillas and they were filled with oil and it disgusted me. When I picked up the quesadilla to eat it, the quesadilla was dripping cooking oil. I'm never going to eat there again. It's too unhealthy."}
{"text":"The food here is SOO much better than other \"fast food\" Mexican. My only complaint is that their \"hot\" sauce is not hot at all. I've had several menu items and so far they've all been pretty good for what you pay."}
{"text":"This place is deeeeelicious!! The salsa is spicy & perfect, the tortillas are the best I've had, everything on the menu is so good! My two favorites are a green chile burrito with beans & cheese or the super nachos. I hope to try the Mesa location soon & I hope its as good!! :) The only thing I wish is that it was a little cheaper, but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"If you like Shrimp Burritos or Fish Tacos, you need to try this place! I usually end up getting the #8 which has a fish taco, shrimp burrito, and Spanish rice! The fish taco is really good, but it's the shrimp burrito that really gets me. It is very filling and has an awesome white sauce (no idea what it is, but it's amazing).   It's a fast food place, but the food tastes homemade. Senor Taco is definitely a go-to place for lunch for me!"}
{"text":"As of right now under renovation. This place is awesome! Breakfast burrito is my favorite. Everything seems to taste a bit better around 2:00am"}
{"text":"This isn't one of those places that is fancy. It's a taco joint. But that isn't a bad thing. They also have plenty more than tacos - sopes, quesadillas, even sandwiches and wings, which probably are not on your mind when you venture into a place called Senor Taco.  What is most important is if you're hungry, they can take care of you here without breaking the bank, and they will do so quickly. Maybe not Taco Bell quickly, but the quality is so much better, and the service is quite likely going to be better too. Definitely worth a stop, and even more so if you find yourself looking for something in this area - someplace that does not have a wide variety."}
{"text":"Stopped here late one night after a softball game and was not impressed. I guess I just went in with my expectations high from a friend who raved about the rolled tacos and red chile. I had the carnita taco.. Carnitas were super salty and dry. Also tried the fish rolled tacos and couldn't figure out where the fish went BUT the white sauce and cheese were good. I should've just ordered a shell with white sauce and cheese.  My daughter loved her red chile burrito. I thought it tasted watery.   I stole a couple of carne asada fries from her friend (I was snacky that night) and they weren't too bad.  I think I'll stick to my fave late night mexi spot that is closer to my house. I won't drop names, but it rocks."}
{"text":"I stopped in real quick as I was grabbing some gas. The place looked like a better option than McDonald's. I ordered burritos, taco's and was please try surprised that the taste was so amazing that I had to leave a good review! Order it all! It was all great!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times I have been very pleased with the food. First time was for shrimp enchiladas which were flavorful and full of shrimp, this time for a shrimp quesadilla that was again loaded with shrimp, perfectly melted white cheese, crisp tortilla, and HUGE. I still have more than half left for another meal. My husband got the al pastor burrito both times and said they were perfect. I love their salsa bar (especially the tomatillo) and that they give you the lettuce and sour cream in a separate container to maintain the integrity of hot versus cold items. I will absolutely be going back to try other items but it will be difficult to stray from the incredible shrimp I have had so far!"}
{"text":"Standard mex food but exactly what I was expecting and just what the doctor ordered on the late night tip! We really enjoyed our food& the service was quick. Large portions and plenty of left overs that were good the next day."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burritos. Less than $5 and served all day.   Whole wheat tortillas now avail. Great salsa bar. Check in on Yelp for 10% off.  Really friendly service."}
{"text":"They have nearly 13 restaurants and are family owned. The food is incredible and every time I get to eat at the restaurant it's packed. The image and cleanliness of each one I have been too has amazed me. Taco's, burritos and hot sauces are tasty. Only down side is that I haven't found one with extremely hot salsa! I give this fast food restaurant a five stars!"}
{"text":"Oh Mister Taco, it's been so long.  I used to pay you a visit ever so often when I lived out in Goodyear but we moved to Tempe and we all know how long distance relationships pan out.  But now here you are, in my neck of the woods, and all is good in the world again.  Your exterior, is nothing like what I remembered in Goodyear, you seem smaller here, accommodating most guests on the patio or serving them through the drive thru, but beauty is only skin deep and well, inside, you're just as amazing as I remembered: always generous (with portions), offering up tasty, tasty variety, and always tempting me with those cinnamon chips which I swear, are calling my name.  I wish you had a salsa bar to rival La Santisima's but I'm happy with my green chile and the great specials on menu.  I'm glad you made it out to Tempe, Mister Taco"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place! I've wanted to try it for years and finally my husband relented.  We have been missing out all those years!  WOW, the tacos are phenomenal!  I don't like lettuce so I only get cheese on them and they pack it in.  It's the biggest taco I've ever had and they use this delicious white cheese.  So good! Their refried beans are fresh and traditional, exactly the way I like them.  Not everyone makes refried beans correctly but this place has nailed it.  Their bean and cheese burrito was huge and my husband said their chicken enchiladas were wonderful.  They have a nice salsa bar with several choices.  Their pricing is good too.  You get a lot for your money.  We will be back A LOT!"}
{"text":"Their food is always outstanding! Only thing i don't like about this place is closing time. i tried to make a togo order over the phone around 9:00 PM and they said we are close alreday. what is the hour posted on the door for?"}
{"text":"I get so sad when I think about this place... I want to like you. I want to think happy thought about eating here but it just never ever happens.   Food is usually cold  Food is always messy Not so friendly people  On the positive note... salsa is always good.   Eh.... not my first choice."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW.  I was in Fountain Hills with family for Memorial Day and needed a good Mexican food joint and Senor Taco was it and more.  Walked in and was greeted by possibly the owner and immediately felt welcome. I  had trouble deciding what to order because they have it all.  Decided on the Diablo shrimp burrito and it was delicious with all the flavors i was hoping for.  The others I went with loved their food and of course the margaritas were refreshing in the Arizona heat. Prices are a steal especially for the fountain Hills area.    If your visiting from out of town and unsure where to go, this is a no brainer."}
{"text":"Perfectly average fast food Mexican restaurant. Tried the California Surfin' burrito and while it was a good size, it had too many flavored and sauces competing with each other. Took ten minutes to get through the drive thru but I'm hoping that was only because of how new the restaurant is. Might return when I need some late night drunk Mexican food, but would rather eat something else sober."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  Been going for years and years.  Rolled tacos please!  This place is like a Filibertos or something, just way better!"}
{"text":"I have been disappointed often with the mexican food here in Arizona. I grew up in the midwest and have had better mexican food there aside from the food I grew up on. After reading the reviews for Senor Taco I decided to give it a whirl today. I am glad that we did! We kept it simple and just ordered the fish taco plate along with a bean burrito we split later. The beans were awesome and the rice was great. The portions were big and super fresh. I'm looking forward to trying more of their food in the future. They have a drive through which is a bonus, too!"}
{"text":"Had the carnitas taco - muy bueno!  The missus had the carne asada, scarfed a mouthful - bueno.  I think the tacos I had at Sonora Mesquite Grill were better, but these were no slouch.  A plus - those pickled hot carrot thingies - maybe it's a Phoenix thing; have never seen those in Dallas."}
{"text":"Ate here last year when in the area. Got the giant burrito. Fills a whole tray! Last year it was filled with ground hamburger and a bunch of other stuff. This time when we got it the meat was more chunks than ground. Not the same. Husband and I shared half and threw the rest out. Although it wasn't terrible, it wasn't what it was before. Plus it seemed really dry like it was over cooked. Sorry to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"If you are in the west valley, forget the drive through \"Bertos/Rico's/etc\" variety and do yourself a favor and go to Senor Taco!!! They do not disappoint! Spectacular fresh food with authentic flavors and generous portions, and all for a good price! There carnitas soft tacos are my favorite as are their shredded beef hard tacos! Their staff is always friendly, and their salsa is consistent in it's delicious flavor and heat! Do not miss out! Great place!!"}
{"text":"After going here 4 times in 2 weeks I decided I finally have to write a review.  Their burritos are amazing! The drive-thru times could be quicker but like I have said a million times before good things are worth waiting for.  A little observance I have done on mexican food.. after talking to people and having them tell me \"this is the best taco place everrrrr!\" then actually going and thinking meh... I think it depends on where you grew up whether its Cali-Mex, Sonoran, Chihuahua style, Tex-Mex, etc..  I grew up on Southern California's \"Cali-Mex\" which is LOTS of AVOCADOS, lots of carne asada, light on the beans, and sometimes fries in the burrito.  In my opinion..as everyone has their own.. this place is more Cali-Mex, which is why I love it so much.  My California friends visit and they absolutely loved this place too! They will definitely see us here more frequently.    My only true complaint is I wish they opened later for those late night after drinking cravings :P  To Try: Crispy Breakfast Burrito Surf and Turf Burrito - CURRENT FAVORITE Hash brown Breakfast Burrito"}
{"text":"Okay Senor, you have my attention.  We've been to this location as a Jack in the Box countless times, so we were waiting to see what place was set up to replace it.  Turns out that it's pretty darned good!  Love their beef enchiladas!  The service here is a little longer than many drive-thrus, but the taste is worth it.  If you want a sit down, more formal Mexican meal, by all means go to La Fonda a short walk away. . .but. . .pssst. . .Senor Taco tastes better.  Not to be mean, it's just. . .fact.  We love this place, and prefer it over a lot of other Mexifood joints that are much more expensive.  This is one of those places where you really can get GREAT taste and a full stomach for a low price.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"First time here. My husband and I both ordered the shrimp taco plate. It was very good- shrimp is grilled and has wonderful flavor. The tacos are quite large and the plate was well worth the price."}
{"text":"Tacos were standard. Tried pastor and asada, would probably go back but I'll try some other places in between."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb. My husband is addicted to their surf n turf burrito and I keep coming back for their tacos. Unlike most Mexican fast food chains, even the guacamole is good! It's not just green watered down goop like you get from other places. Also, the green salsa is great. I'm not even a fan of green salsa usually but Senor Tacos is nice and spicy. We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this is a chain. Homemade tortilla, a salsa bar with the best spicy pickled onions and carrots and fresh ingredients. I did not know what to expect since we were just passing through and the area is a lot of chains. Reasonable proces, quick friendly service and tasty food. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"I bought the crew \"California Surfin\" burritos and everyone was very happy with the results. It was like a normal CA burro with shrimp and a kind of fish taco sauce. I dare you to try and finish it all in one sitting. Very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner is from San Diego, so it's close to my Cali heart and the food is exactly as good as I remember it being."}
{"text":"BEST Shrimp Tacos anywhere.  Great portion sizes.  Takes a little time to get the orders since they make it FRESH, but worth the wait.  Prices rose after remodel, but quality has remained. (Shrimp taco that is loaded is now about $3.  Fish Taco when on special is still under $2). It's open 24 hours and is busy most times of the day.  Go inside if you want to help yourself to the salsa bar with numerous salsas and veggie options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both got the California Surfin burrito. It was HUGE. Like, almost the size of a puppy. And it was delicious. The sauce seriously brought it to a whole other level. I was only able to finish half and thought I'd get to save the other half for the next day, but my burrito fiend of a boyfriend finished it off while I was asleep. This is now my favorite burrito place."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious, but they just can't seem to understand that \"no tomatoes\" actually means \"no tomatoes\".  I've had their food delivered three different times with that specification, and each time I've had to scrape a boatload of tomatoes off the food.  I won't tempt fate a fourth time; I've learned my lesson well, and there are plenty of other taco shops to choose from."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it are the portion sizes. But if the food is gross, than you don't really want a lot of it. Had the mixed burrito with chicken. Very little flavor. Got it \"wet\" and the enchilada sauce tasted like tomato sauce. No flavor. Doesn't come with chips or anything. 10 minutes after eating about half I have a terrible stomach ache and have already run to the bathroom twice. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"The food is very good here and the service was great. Workers were kind. The wait can be a little long, especially during lunch hour but it is worth it. The taco Tuesday street taco deal is great and affordable. Not a lot of seating but would definitely recommend.   TL;DR- Great food. Nice service. A little longer than usual wait. Definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"Food is authentic, service was friendly (they even came by while I was eating to see if everything was ok) and the place was very clean. Overall this is a great place for some tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"Quick and inexpensive.    Their fish tacos aren't something to right home about, but I highly recommend trying their shrimp tacos or machaca burro.   Staff is friendly and keeps the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"I'm working out at Litchfield Park this month so I finally had a chance to try Senior Taco--a place that always seems packed at their Fountain Hills location the times I am up there.   This is sort of a Filiberto's-style place. It is fast food, it has a similar menu. The prices are similar. However, the food was quite different.   I tried three things, trying some of each and bringing some back to the office with me. First, the carne asada torta. I would say this is the most similar in flavor to Filibertos. Not bad, but not super great. It would have benefited from more meat and less guacamole. I also had a shredded beef, hard-shell taco. This was quite a bit different than Filiberto's and, in my opinion, better. They did not fry it as much, and it had a lot more cheese than I usually get at Filibertos. I also had the carne asada soft taco. The size was large and it was very good. Nothing here is super great, but the tacos were especially yummy.   Service, cleanliness and all of the rest were average or above for a fast food restaurant.   I give it 3.5 stars--leaning toward four due to the size of the dishes for the price."}
{"text":"I've only had their breakfast burrito but had it twice during the same trip. So good! The salsa that they included was amazing! I wish I could buy that in a large jar, I'd add it to everything. Can't wait to visit again and try more than just breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The daily specials are my favorite! So much food for decent prices. I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"The carnitas combo platter is also good as well.  We have been  eating off of the to go  order for the past 3 days the HUGE qty of meat has made a total of around 8 tacos. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love their tacos. It usually takes a little while to get your food but that's how you know it's made to order."}
{"text":"Can I please franchise this place and bring it to NYC?  Very very very good, quick Mexican.  Tacos, tamale (a little on the small side) and the California burrito were all amazing.  Salsa bar is everything that is right in the world.  Full menu available from the minute they open!  I will be back before we leave Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Standard fast food Mexican joint. Burritos are huge! I ordered the chorizo breakfast with beans and it was tasty. The chorizo was definitely NOT store bought. Beans were really good. My girl shared her chilaqueles with me and they tasted good. They were fresh, too. Good options at the salsa bar. The green and dark red salsa are really good. Will come back."}

{"text":"Came here to try the Carne Asada plate with rice, beans, and corn tortillas. I should have known to ask for no garnish, but I didn't know there would be guac too... Had to avoid that corner of the plate. The carne asada was good, nicely seasoned. I found that the corn tortillas kind of detracted from the flavor of the meat. The rice had corn in it, which I am not a fan of. The beans were pretty good. Also tried some of the fries my b/f ordered. They tasted alright, but maybe cooked in old oil. The iced tea was a nice surprise, like it's infused with strawberry or a similar fruity flavor. It was good! Very filling meal."}
{"text":"Yum!  Breakfast burritos are freaking awesome. Their bean and cheese burrito is very good. They gave a drive thru (its all made fresh so there is a wait)but god. Lots of salsas to choose from and specials. We stop to and from work often."}
{"text":"I guess when I saw 4 stars I expected more.  I just ordered 3 chicken tacos.. not hard at a Mexican place right?  The chicken is red, there's only one kind of cheese, I was forced to listen to a Mexican music station the entire time, all customers (less two) were speaking Spanish the entire time, and the entire staff spoke Spanish the entire time.. it looked clean.. the staff seemed nice..I ate 1 1/2 tacos, didn't like them, threw the rest away, and walked out thinking 1) I wouldn't come back 2) I didn't like that food and 3) at least it wasn't McDonalds next door..."}
{"text":"That's just some really good really fast comida shredded beef tacos not too greasy and totally tasty rice and beans were also very good win win"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Love the Menudo on the weekends! The girls upfront always have a smile. Surf and turf is a great one too!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, the cashier were so friendly and helpful. I saw the owner there and we had a good conversation about the startup of the business, would definitely recommend this family owned business!"}
{"text":"This location consistently gets an \" A\" from the health dept. I love the fact that you can order from each menu regardless of the time of day. My favorite item by far is the grande breakfast burrito, it's $7 and can feed three adults. This place has the tastiest pi√±a juice I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Not bad on pricing.  Atmosphere is great and cool especially in the summer. Repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Best fast food Mexican in the state! I have tried almost all \"fast food\" Mexican restaurants around, and se√±or taco is by far the best. Their mild red sauce is amazing. I recommend the California Surfin burrito! It is delicious!  The Only down side to this place is the higher than market price, but it is worth the few extra bucks!"}
{"text":"The food is not very good. The horchata was disappointing. The rolled tacos and quesadillas are probably the only ok things on the menu."}
{"text":"We frequent Se√±or Tacos almost once a week. We absolutely love it. My two toddlers say it is their favorite place to eat. Anything you order here is going to taste good and the workers are always friendly."}
{"text":"We order and take home every couple weeks. They give very large portions. Everything we've tried has been pretty tasty. They are on the slow side so we usually call ahead."}
{"text":"Good food but they have messed up my order twice :( I don't think I will be going back to this location anymore."}
{"text":"I'm going to weigh in here after eating on the other side of town at a more expensive restaurant. We love this place and eat here when we want Mexican.We should have come here tonight!  It is informal, fast food but the fish tacos are really good and the food comes ready for you to spice yourself over at the salsa bar (great idea!). Flavors are always good, the food quality is high for this kind of a place and it is very competitively priced."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome mexican food!  Get the 3 rolled aces and 2 quesadilla combo... I rocks!!  The carne asda burr also hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing!!! Shredded beef with lots of cheese and lettuce. Their shells are crispy without being greasy! Green chili burrito is also solid!"}
{"text":"The best thing to happen to this building in a long time. I spend way too much money here, but damn, my stomach is always satisfied after I engulf whatever burrito I get. I highly recommend the California Surfin' as it pleasures the taste buds in so many ways. The only thing is that it is not fast. Their drive-thru can take some time, especially if there is a line... it is worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place a few days ago. I had the beef enchilada, beef taco with rice and beans. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas with rice and beans. The beef enchilada meat was seasoned perfectly as were the refried beans. The beef taco meat however didnt seem to have any seasoning. The meat was good but just no flavor really. I would assume they would use the same seasoned shredded beef for the taco that they used on the enchilada but I guess not. Either way the food was very fresh and flavorful minus the beef in my taco. Prices were good for the amount of food you get. Service was a bit bla, but I was ordering take out anyways. Will definetly return to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Met by buddy's S & T here for lunch. I got the Carnitas Burrito ($6.49). This is a very large burrito for the money. Full of succulent roasted pork and pico de gallo.  I aso got a side of Guacamole ($0.50) which for the 2 quarters it cost is a screamin deal. A large drink ($1.99) from the fountain and I was good to go. S got the California Surfin' Burrito which he devoured quite rapidly so I'll assume it was muy deliciouso. The restaurant was clean and the young lady working the counter was super friendly. There were quite a few condiment selections at the salsa bar including some yummy hot chile oil, multiple types of salsa and roasted chiles. Winner winner chicken dinner. Clean restaurant, super nice employees, great food. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Senor Taco has a great atmosphere with friendly staff. I had the menudo and it was outstanding!!! Wide selection of authentic Mexican dishes to choose from with very generous portions. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been here but lately, I have ordered a lot through UberEATS. The ceviche is on point. I love it. The ceviche is why my rating is a 3 and not lower.   My review is completely focused on their \"flautas\". I expected traditional flautas in tightly rolled, deep fried, crunchy corn tortillas. Instead I got greasy shredded chicken inside a giant, deep fried flour tortilla smothered in red sauce. Apparently i took a high risk ordering something online that didn't have a picture. I get that. Buy I'll never order this item again. It was gross."}
{"text":"This place is okay just a hole in the wall to me that uses a microwave to reheat about everything. There horchata is good but everything else is cold..."}
{"text":"This place is great! Simple. Not a huge menu, but everything we've tried is tasty and satisfying. And the price is right. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Today I become upset with the inconsistency of serving portions and the quality. My usual order is one chicken taco and a side. One day it'll contain large amounts of chicken, or it'll be like today where the chicken pieces were small, harden pieces that sat too long in the container."}
{"text":"Popular place when your open almost all the time! what a great business. everything tastes fresh and delicious. first time here i got a breakfast burrito.   super yummy! staff even brought it to my table, great friendly staff that really puts love and care into the food and makes sure the customers are happy. tables are clean, place is clean! as soon as someone leaves i see someone immediately go to the table and clean it. thats good service. this place is great. nothing bad to say about it, try it for yourself.  good food, good service, fast execution.   thank you Se√±or Taco"}
{"text":"So, when I think of Se√±or Taco I think of one of those places that serves Mexican food and it only tastes good when you're drunk. Well, I'm wrong! I mean, I'm sure it tastes good when you're drunk but it tastes good when you're sober too! I'm addicted to the veggie burrito! I get it w/o cheese, sour cream, or pico and I add in cilantro and jalape√±os (I don't eat dairy). The burrito comes with guacamole, lettuce, refried beans (not cooked in lard), and spanish rice. It is so tasty and tastes really authentic. Pair it with their mild salsa and it's AMAZINGGG!   My friend gets the chicken nachos and they're loaded with cheese and plenty of chicken. Yum if you're into that!"}
{"text":"Simply put this is my favorite Mexican food spot in the entire Phoenix area. Nothing fancy just good simple Mexican good.  The salsa is great,  made perfect for their food. The tortillas are excellent and obviously made fresh daily. I've yet to try something I don't like here.  If you like tacos, burritos, quesadillas etc then this is your place."}
{"text":"I really like this Se√±or Taco, better atmosphere than the one on Estrella Parkway. I usually get the 'Surf and Turf' burrito...and most of the time share it with the kids. We had a school fundraiser night here and we kept going back ever since. Nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Oh, chips come with the burrito?  I'm too full for my burrito now!  Okay, it's located in a building that once was Jack in The Box so you know you're not here for the atmosphere, indoor seating is incredibly limited so good luck during the summer, but the food is pretty decent and your money goes a long way here.  This place is also ridiculously busy, both ordering at the counter and at the drive-thru, so do yourself a favor and park on the east side of the lot to avoid being blocked in by the insane drive-thru line.  Now let's talk about food, babie!  It's fresh and hot and the portions are huge.  One burrito is easily two meals for me.  Still hungry?  Get the Se√±or Burro!  The menu said it was \"mucho big\" and mucho big it was.  It was seriously the whole length of my forearm and surprisingly, everything held up well and tasted just as delicious as my smaller burrito.  Se√±or Taco hits the spot and I'm not mad about their modest-sized salsa bar.  I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This page actually uses Mexican Queso fresco on their quesadillas.  They are delicious must try."}
{"text":"Food is great but skip the drive thru- it takes way too long.  I was the only car in line.  The new Crunchy Chipolte Burrito is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a decent Mexican restaurant to open in my neighborhood. I used to travel down to Ray all the time for the best breakfast burritos I could find. Now they are just down the block! 1 breakfast burrito is two meals unless you are incredibly hungry. The only downside is the wait times as it takes 10 to 15 minutes for your food, so this shouldn't be considered fast food, but it is well worth the wait every time. You get extremely friendly service, a fresh salsa bar, and a huge amount of food for the money. Their $6 special combo plates are ridiculous. Lots of fresh rice and beans and fantastic enchiladas or fish tacos. I've had four different things on the menu and can't wait to try more. I would go there more often but I am trying to lose weight! If you want some food which is 10 times better than the local Filibertos, give Senor Taco a chance or two or three."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant! Hash brown breakfast burrito is to die for, fish taco or fish burrito is excellent. My other fav is the shredded chicken burrito. Hard to have a bad meal here. Cheap too."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious breakfast burros!  I got the steak and egg and my husband got the California Surfing burro. He loooooved it with the spicy chipotle sauce, carne asada & shrimp. Wish one was closer to our home in north Peoria."}
{"text":"Glad most of the reviews are positive. The place is okay--just wish their crunchy tacos weren't so greasy and soggy. The hard shell disintegrates into mush within seconds due to the moisture in the meat. To be fair, I haven't had anything else on the menu, so give it a try...just don't order a hard-shell taco and expect to hear a \"crunch\" sound when you bite down."}
