{"text":"Lychee Bay serves a dish called \"Dragon, tiger, and phoenix\". When I came here for dinner with my family, we spent some time guessing what food they use as the dragon, the tiger, and the phoenix. My dad was reasonably sure that the dragon is snake and the phoenix is chicken, but could the tiger really be cat?! I mean, I know several Asian cultures eat it, but that's just back in Asia, right??  So my dad asked the waiter what the \"tiger\" was, and the waiter told him it was rabbit.  As we sat there looking relieved that we were wrong about people actually wanting to eat cats, the waiter told us, \"We have to use rabbit because they don't have cat in Canada\".  Thank goodness for Canadian food laws is all I have to say.  We didn't order the dragon, tiger, and pheonix dish (it costs $69!!), but all the dishes we did order were really tasty. Everything was well made and not too salty or greasy.  The presentation of certain dishes were quite interesting and gave them a little extra flair over the typical cheapo Chinese restaurant. The steamed fish comes cut into smaller pieces and laid out very nicely, and I saw one table that ordered a lobster dish that looked amazing. The chunks of lobster were battered and fried, and served in a mound with a huge lobster head/carapace displayed on the mound. The prices are on par with other mid-range Chinese restaurants. Not exactly cheap but not considered an expensive restaurant either.  Just a good solid place for dinner.  My only complaint is that this restaurant suffers from the common syndrome of having dishes posted around the wall in Chinese writing only, which don't appear on the main menu - the one with English translations.  Then again, the \"Dragon, tiger, phoenix\" was one of these dishes...so maybe I can understand why.  It probably is better to go here with someone who speaks Chinese, as the staff didn't seem to be able to communicate in English."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I'D EVER EXPERIENCED, WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK!!!  I'd been to this restaurant a few times with my GF's family and I must say their quality of service and food quality have dropped to the point that I believe they will only drive customers away by the way they do business.  The food:  3/5  Mainly Cantonese style dishes with a load of oil and grease.  Taste wise, average to a little above average at best.  Tried their perserved veggies with pork, lobster, steam fish and random veggie dishes and they were all OK at best, not worth the price you have to pay for their quality of food.  The service:  0/5  I'd NEVER experience such bad service.  No smiles from any of their waitstaff, no thank you, no check ups, wrong items arrived on our tables, no eye contact when they talk to you.  Waited at their front door for 10 minutes with half their restaurant empty and 4 waitstaff walked right past us and not one sinlge staff talked to us.  The atmosphere:  2/5  It was a fairly bright place, typical open concept Chinese restaurant with 2 private rooms.  Nothing special and tables are tightly squeezed.  The price: 1/5  If you want to feed a group of 4 with seafood, be prepare to pay upwards of $120.00 and at least $70.00 without seafood.  (both without tax nor tips included).  For the price they charge, I can go to an ACTUAL restaurant with some GOOD FOOD and DECENT service.     End note:       I arrived at this restaurant at 7:30 pm yesterday along with my grandparents and my girlfriend.  Upon our arrival their were at least 6 available tables and 4 servers walking around and they all saw us standing at the front (4 of us, 2 were SENIORs 80+ and 90+) NOT ONE SINGLE SERVER came and said a thing to us but all looked our way and saw us standing there.            My GF really needed to use the washroom (after waiting for approx. 5 mins) so I told her to just go and use their washroom and if they don't give us a seat by the time you come out, we will go elsewhere,  So she went and came and still no one talked to us so we decided to leave, BUT here is the BEST PART!!!  A group of 5 came in right when we were about to leave and the server IMMEDIATELY went to them and asked them to see if they needed a seat.  So at that point I asked the server \"why they didn't ask us first and why didn't they come by for 10 minute\", his respond was \"I DIDN'T ASK YOU ANYTHING, I WAS TALKING TO THE GROUP BEHIND YOU!!\".  I was pretty upset but didn't want to make a scene out of it (mind you we had 2 seniors in their 80s and 90s standing there for 10 minutes) so we decided to just leave and went to Fantasy Eatery instead!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.  Staff wasn't really friendly, and missed one of our orders to the kitchen. Would appreciate it if the food temperature can be a bit higher.  Portion size is alright, but not very proportionate, seem like they try to make the dishes fuller by adding more of the compliment ingredients.  If I get to choose, will not come back here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for 3 times already, the experiences actually getting better and better. First time we waited for a long time to get a table for 2, as they don't have any small table. But service was pretty good, the waitress even let us know that one of the item in a dish was so good that the chef decided they can't serve it. And she recommend us to try another dish which turns out really good.  Second time we were there a bit early to beat the dinner time rush. Even as the place starts to filled up with people waiting at the door, they didn't \"check up\" on us or drop the bill on us to make us leave.  Last week we were there again for dinner, they listen to our request to make changes to the dish and didn't charge us for the change. (We end up paying more as gratitudes.) They even help us to take pictures of our group as our friend is leaving town for good.  Well... The parking is a problem here as this plaza is really small. May be you can park at the royal bank's parking lot which is just next to it."}
{"text":"I always come here and eat with my boyfriend's dad and his family and have been to this restaurant a couple of times with friends. The service is pretty good and the food is also really good. Definitely order the deep fried lobster, deep fried squid, SNAILS in black bean sauce. The soup that they serve is amazing and feels good for the soul (usually bigger tables).   they only take cash here so make sure you remember to fill up your wallets!  Overall, good price, good service and good food."}
{"text":"First time here with my friend and her family. I've heard of this place before but never really tried it..so this was my first time..It's an A-OK place. I guess its because people see how successful Fisherman's has become so they would like to have a scoop of the profits...LOL...  The lobster here has it's own style and it's not bad...they have some creativity in their Chinese dishes I have to say...There was a dish which really caught my taste buds and eyes....It was soft tofu covered in light bread crumbs batter and baked in cheese...it seemed quite interesting and the taste was quite delicious...  We had a big lobster for dinner, some veggie and meat dishes..All in all this place was an A-OK...I will come back in case Fisherman's is fully booked..."}
{"text":"Pricy for dinner. Big lobster was served. Did a banquet meal that featured traditional dishes from different chinese regions. Part of outdoor Chinese plaza. May return to try the ordinary menu."}
{"text":"Went there with 5 friends today.  Waitress never put up a smile and seems impatient. Food took quite a bit of time to come up. Price is very expensive so we expect a bigger portion...but that wasn't the case (very small). Just for example, sweet and sour pork cost about $14. I had better sweet and sour pork for much cheaper price."}
{"text":"2.5 Star   I always believe in giving restaurant a second chance. This review though is based on my dinner experience.  Menu is like a photo album with really nice photos of dish they serves. Fun to browse through and seems like there are so many to choose from.  Honey Pepper Beef with Broccoli ($11.95) and Rice with Shrimp and Roe ($15.95) that we ordered were both disappointing. Both lack the balance in taste. The beef tasted bland while the broccoli was over salty. The steamed rice was good portion wise but still lack flavour.   The complimentary soup and dessert (bird nest w/milk) though were quite good! Maybe I should just come in for the freebie?"}
