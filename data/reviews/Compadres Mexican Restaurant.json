{"text":"I like to review new restaurants and I want to say good things.  Here, the service is very good and friendly and the food is served very quickly.  On the bad side, my wife ordered a margarita and it was pretty much just lime juice.  Terrible!  My margarita was ok, but seemed small for the price. The food...not good.  I had the enchiladas Verde and the sauce seemed to be primarily vinegar.  It even had a metallic taste.  The rice was pretty much the same.  My wife's enchiladas mole was somewhat better, but still had that vinegar taste. I really wanted to like this place, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Our first time tonight at this family owned restarant. There was a bit of a wait but usually that means the food is good and that was exactly the case.  The table side prepared guac was excellent, as were the margaritas. Our server was working very hard but always with a smile. A very nice gentleman was coming around asking how everything was and in talking with him, we found out his name was Manny and he and his parents are the owners. These are very hard working people and they are very customer oriented! We will be back and I'm sure there will be a wait but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Good food, inviting atmosphere staff makes you feel like part of the family. This place will be my recommendation to anyone looking for a fun place to dine. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I had in while. Salsa is actually at the right spice level and not blend."}
{"text":"Not enough staff to provide quality service. Screaming children in the restaurant. We sat in the back of the restaurant and had sunshine in our eyes the whole time. Food okay."}
{"text":"It was busy but we did not have a long wait.  The food tasted excellent.  Had the chimichanga.  The price was reasonable.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Prompt friendly service. A bit hard to find - GPS takes you to the back door, but entrance on other side of the building. It is worth finding the front! Table made guacamole was great. Good prices."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Mexican restaurant. I love to order tamales, tostadas& tacos a la carte and skip all the rice& bean carbs. It is very inexpensive to eat this way... and delicious!    The service is excellent here. The waitresses 'cross-cover'. I have been here several times and whenever I am looking up for a server ( re:an empty cocktail glass or in need of a napkin for a spill) someone always notices& comes right over... even if it is not my 'assigned' server. Cannot express how refreshing this is... especially since I often dine alone & many restaurants all but ignore a lone diner.  Great job Compadres staff!    As a vegetarian... I am also thrilled to find their vegetarian entrees actually include... vegetables! Broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, zucchini, peppers, onions, etc. All fresh & grilled to perfection.  Too many Mexican restaurants shun vegetables and their \"vegetarian entrees\" are nothing more than beans& cheese.    I also enjoyed their cocktails... the mango paloma with chamoy ( Mexican spices ) and table side guacamole are alone worth the trip.    This place is a favorite of mine... and judging from the noon and weekend crowds I am not alone."}
{"text":"YES! I LOVE HAVING THIS PLACE IN MIDDLETON.  I don't even know where to start because I have so many good thoughts about this place.  I love their story - the family immigrated here from Mexico to open a restaurant. This is a small, family owned business and the pride they take in their business shows.  The ambiance is nice. It's not over done, and has modern, sleek lines. It's a little more upscale than a traditional Mexican restaurant, but it is still casual.  We started with margaritas which were fine. Nothing special. Everything else that came out was amazing though! I went with 3 other people, so we ordered quite a few items on the menu and everything was to die for. Even their rice was good, and I never eat Spanish rice.  Our faves were the cheese dip, pollo Santa Fe, and chimichangas.  The servers were all very attentive and helpful. The menu is huge so we had a hard time selecting what we wanted. Our server went through it with us and shared his favorite items. We talked to one of the women at the bar (I wish I could remember her name) and she gave us details about her family and how their grand opening went. It really felt they were giving us this personalized experience, and like they will remember us when we go back (which we will, very soon!).  BTW - the green salsa they bring out once you are seated is pretty spicy so be ready. :-)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the Madison area! Amazing tacos (highly recommend chorizo and al pastor), fajitas, salsa, and guacamole. In addition, the service is outstanding! Wonderful family-owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly.  I've been here twice and had tacos and tostadas.  The tostadas are full sized, unlike many similar restaurants using small shells.  The star of all of Compadres for me is the carnitas.  It is currently my favorite thing to consume on planet earth."}
{"text":"Was really good! When you first walk in seems really classy and a good atmosphere.  I order to go, was fast about 15 minutes, everything packed up, did not spill, was hot and fresh.  I had fajitas, was a great size portion that i did not finish and some chips and salsa for the side.  All in all a great Mexican restaurant and I will be back to dine in sometime.  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing place. We had table side made qauc. That was awesome... but they gave us a sample before serving the bowl to make sure we liked it. I loved the salsa bowls so cute.  They pay attention to small details of service and it shows! Amazing we will be back."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today and can't wait to come back! I am left with the impression that everything was really fresh tasting with bright flavors and a pleasing presentation. The restaurant itself is clean and bright and there is an outdoor space that I plan to try out before the summer is through.  I enjoyed a margarita on the rocks with lunch - good flavor with a sweet finish but not cloying. I ordered the Mexicana burrito and really liked it a lot. The cheese sauce was delicious. I asked for a side of verde sauce as well, which was evidently the $2 up-charge on my check, but it was served in a cool little edible tortilla bowl so I suppose that's where that comes from! The complimentary chips and salsa were good - both the mild and hot salsas were very good and I didn't feel the hot version was over the top.  The menu is large, and with the sampling of flavors I had today I am looking forward to going back and trying more! The restaurant was full today over the lunch hour but had emptied out by about 12:30 so I would suggest getting there either at 11 or after noon on a week day if today was any indication."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love coming to compadres whether I need a good marg or craving Mexican food, they never fail me! I never have to wait long to get a table (or wait at all) and the service is always good and fast! Tons of options on their menu, impossible to find something you wouldn't want to try. The only suggestions I'd have for them is to add some pictures to the menus, next to the meal listed. Sometimes I can't remember exactly what certain plates are called (for example, they have a photo of a gordita but without a caption, and its not by the gordita listed on the menu and it took me several google searches to figure out what I needed to order). Other than that, the food is excellent and it's a lovely spot! I love coming here"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been to this restaurant 4 times.  The first two times the food was above average and the service was slow, but friendly.  The time before tonight, I went with my family and parents.  I asked for a table for six and they said it would be 10-15 minutes.  20 minutes later I noticed 2 tables of six getting seated.  I asked the host, he went to the woman I spoke with and she said she \"was confused.\"  Never got a full explanation.    Tonight, we ordered an appetizer, three entrees and three drinks.  We got our entrees not long after our drinks, but no appetizer.  I asked about it and the waitress said she'd bring it.  She never did.  I also had to ask 3 times for a glass of water.  Finally got that.  On top of that, my wife and I both found a hair in our food.  Right at the end of course!   I'm bummed to say this, but I think I'm done with Compadres.  Too bad too, I thought it would be a go to restaurant for me and my family."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Mexican food, this was a quick stop with lots of variety the menu. The staff was friendly and food and drinks came out in a timely manner. I wasn't overly impressed with the food or drinks; the salsa servings were tiny (for chips and salsa); the crushed margaritas had big chunks of ice in it; the decor is a little stale. The one saving grace were the enchilladas - very tasty! But when I think of the overall experience, I'm not sure I'd jump at going back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican around! Fresh, tasty and lots of choices you don't often see on Mexican menus here in the Madison area. Service is fantastic! You can tell they really appreciate your business. I love the chicken chimichanga. So good! Fajitas are great, etc. We haven't had food that was anything other than fantastic."}
{"text":"Compadres is a hidden gem in Middleton. Margaritas are strong and delicious, service was promp and freindly and the food is second to none. I would add an extra star because this place is OFF THE CHARTS!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in years! Fresh, cooked to perfection.  Tortillas are the perfect texture too!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, great staff, enjoyable experience. Will definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and everyone is correct - the service is extremely pleasant! I asked for a recommendation but eventually just settled on the Compadres Fajitas because everything sounded good. They were solid with really good corn tortillas.   The salsa were both good and the green was spicy. I asked for hot sauce with the fajitas (I saw a review that suggested they didn't have any) and was offered more of the green salsa which I accepted. I think they might have an even spicier option. Beans are coldish like others have said.   Will come back and try something different."}
{"text":"That was a very satisfying meal. One of the better Mexican restaurants in town for sure. We ate a steak Torta, a Carne Asada, a chicharron Gordita and several different tacos. Every meal of our deserved a 5 Star except for the tacos.   Honestly, I will not come here for tacos but their service, the fresh chips and salsa to begin our meal, the guacamole prepared fresh at the table (it is pretty pricy for $8.50) and the other entrees we had, it is must try place. Out of all the things we had today, the steak torta was so good. I will crave this one for sure and come back for it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. It's got a straight forward menu and Pepsi. Yes, I'm a fan. When I sat down I was provided two salsas and chips. The chips had been around a little while, it didnt have there crisp I'd like to have - it was there just not as fresh. Dealing with the lunch crowd, I can understand. I want explained as to which salsa was more spicier than the other but I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered the green salsa was the spicier of the two. It was not the cumen hot pepper fired salsa, it had some heat but not a lot. Very tasty but I stuck with the milder red. After I ordered my drink and seasoned chicken burrito mexicano she returned in quickly with my soda and not too long after my burrito. Wow! Great for the lunch time rush! I was able to ask the difference between the seasoned chicken vs chicken, the seasoned is shredded and in tomato sauce. So upon digging in, it was a tasty experience. Veges inside, like tomatoes, lettuce, and the tasty cheese and meat (I held off on rice and beans). All of this goodness with guacamole, sour cream, red sauce (it's their red salsa) and cheese sauce made it a tasty mess. I did ask for more guac and sour cream. It was worth the extra charge. Next time I might get the lunch special or try the shrimp tacos. Either way, I'm going back! Yummmm."}
{"text":"Average Mexican fare.  Salsa was very bland.  Very slow inattentive service. Had to request more chips, water etc. food took 25 mins to arrive Vegetarian and shrimp tacos were very good. Veggie tacos had lots of unusual vegetables like cauliflower, yellow and green squash etc."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Perfect service, fab drinks, great food!! I will be coming back here frequently!!!"}
{"text":"This was just OK for me.  I went twice, once with friends and another with my wife.  The service is extremely friendly and snappy-fast.  If you are looking for a smile, kind servers, and in-and-out in about 30-40 minutes, this is your place.    But the food wasn't special.  I had the seasoned chicken quesadilla the first time. It was light on filling.  I found myself wanting for more, although the tortilla was tasty.  So the next time I tried what others told me was good:  a grilled chicken Chimichanga.  Again, it wasn't bad, but there was a premium put on the tortilla part and less on the chicken and cheese filling.  The prices were reasonable.  It's a very cost-effective place to have a sit-down meal compared to other restaurants in Middleton.  If I go again, I'll probably try the tableside guac and the fajitas, both of which looked great as they were delivered to the tables."}
{"text":"Ate my tacos so fast that I wasn't able to snap a pic. Food came out fast and the tacos were jam packed with meat.... an absolute must have in my book. Considering there are a bunch of newer Mexican restaurants popping up all over Middleton, this one is one of the better ones! Will return."}
{"text":"In town on business and needed food late-ish on a Sunday. Since it was close to the hotel and and had good reviews, I checked this place out. When I walked in I was surprised how small it was. Since there were only a couple of tables open, I opted to sit a the large bar to leave space for others. Staff were very helpful and greeted me quickly and handed me a menu. The menu is expansive with lots of specialties and staples. I opted for a verde burrito with carnitas. It was prepared an served very quickly and was one of the best burritos I've had in some time. The carnitas was that perfect balance of crispy and fatty. The burrito also had rice and beans in it. All were nicely balanced with no one ingredient dominating. Prices were incredibly reasonable as well. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious- I don't eat meat and there were many vegetarian options, more than the typical bean and cheese burrito, I had the vegetarian quesadilla, that had carrots, zucchini, broccoli and cauliflower roasted and stuffed with cheeses in a crispy tortilla. I was stuffed but forced myself to finish it!"}
{"text":"The masa here is out of this world good. The vegetarian sope and the chorizo con papas gordita was spectacular.  I'll start with the sope. We all know that veggies  get less attention than they are due at most restaurants. Not here, both the zuchini and broccoli were caramelized and delicately seasoned. They want you to be able to add a touch of their housemade salsas without salt overload. The sope itself was superbly cooked with just enough beans to make me weak in the knees.  The gordita was the best I've ever had. Again the masa was perfect. The ratio of beans to chorizo to potato with the accent of tomato, lettuce, and cheese had me ordering another before the first was gone. At $3.50, I would drive across town at rush hour for another.  The fish taco was okay. The enchiladas were also good, but the gordita and sope...oh my. Get your butt out to middleton, this place deserves to be bonkers busy with this masa! I have yet to try the huaracha from Compadres, but I will be bringing out the family for round two this weekend!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, we thought we'd give Compadres a try for lunch. We weren't disappointed. We found the decor classy with quality furnishings, unlike some other typical Mexican restaurants. We were greeted warmly and shown to a window booth. Chips & two types of salsa were delivered promptly. The menu has much to choose from. I chose the lunch special with a choice of two smaller entrees. The grilled chicken enchilada with mole sauce was excellent, but even better was the chicken chimichanga. It was accompanied by sides of rice and re fried beans. Everything seemed fresh and homemade.   The restaurant is staffed by, I believe, family members from Mexico, leading to my only negative comment. There was a slight language barrier communicating our order.   All in all a quality lunch experience. A restaurant we'll likely return to considering the other interesting offerings."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. The margarita and food was very good. The waitress got a kick out of me trying out my Spanish while ordering. Bright, sunny atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by anything, but there wasn't much to complain about either. I had the enchiladas verdes, they we're tasty but pretty average. Service was fast and pleasant.   I'll stop by again as it is near work, buy probably won't drive all the way out to Middleton to eat here."}
{"text":"Okay - I found it, best Mexican food joint in Madison. I ate at the bar and was served by the awesome bartender / staff. Ordered the Molcahetes as the recommendation from the bartender. I have had a molcahetes previously, usually there is some sort of sauce all over it. This one was a bit different, it was almost fajitas style, with a side of rice, beans and guacamole.   It was so good. Coming from California I can honestly say this place is a gem and I highly recommend anyone to come here.  Everything in the molcahete was flavorful!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I've missed Compadre's. I've driven by its location several times, and I'm fairly aware of Mexican restaurants in the area, but I had never heard of Compadre's until I recently ran across it on Yelp.  Pros: - Guacamole at the table is fun and tasty. Watching the guacamole made tableside is an interesting experience. I also liked how we could choose which ingredients went into our guacamole as well as the quantity of each ingredient. The end product was divine. - The fajita veggies are delicious and cooked perfectly. They were fresh, crisp and full of flavor. I would simply return to Compadre's to just eat a whole plate of the fajita veggies alone. - The fish in the fish tacos was fresh and very flavorful. I've eaten some less-than-stellar fish tacos at some Mexican restaurants before -- I think because the fish was not fresh -- but that was not the case with Compadre's. - Service was very good.   Cons: -This restaurant desperately needs wall decor. The whole dining area is just tile floors, plain walls and a few interesting light fixtures. Photos, paintings, Mexican quilts, sombreros -- anything -- needs to be on the walls. Eating at Compadre's is kind of like visiting your friend's new house who hasn't had a chance to unpack yet. It's just plain and empty. -Margaritas were not good. The margarita mix/tequila/ice ratio was pretty pathetic. My entire margarita glass was filled to the brim -- even above the brim -- with ice cubes. The small amount of liquid actually in the glass consisted of watery-tasting margarita mix and barely any tequila. I drank two margaritas at Compadre's. I know what effects I should feel after two margaritas. I felt nothing. I either received virgin margaritas, which I did not request, or I received margaritas that only included literally a splash of tequila.  Add some decor and fix the lousy margaritas, and Compadre's will get five stars from me."}
{"text":"Seriously don't understand what the hype is about. It was the blandest Mexican food I have ever had. With so many fabulous options available in the Madison area of Tex-mex my personal opinion is that the ratings are over inflated.   The service was great. We were seated promptly and the food arrived in a timely manner. This was our first disappointing dinner since we moved to Madison. I wish the food was seasoned better."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  They were super busy and still had amazing service.  Everyone we talked to was very nice and wanted to make sure our experience was great.    They have a great family story and you can see the pride they take in their food and culture.     The margarita was great, I recommend on getting the grande.   I also had my usual dish of testing a Mexican restaurant which is a chicken chimichanga and it is one of the best in Madison.  I will be coming back often.  My only recommendation for the owners is to use a plate warmer, it doesn't need to be super hot, but my beans started to get cold in the middle of the meal due to the cold plates."}
{"text":"So delicious! We stopped in for lunch. My son had the Compadres Enchiladas and I had the Huraches Vegetarian, a side of guacamole and a Rajas tamale. I especially liked the vegetarian version of Huraches with roasted carrots, summer squash, broccoli and cauliflower. My son gave the Compadres Enchiladas a. If thumbs up. The staff is friendly and helpful. The interior is beautiful. Parking is easy too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food. I recommend the cheese dip, tableside guac, tamales, and sopes. Great service by all the staff. Very clean and fun environment."}
{"text":"Great food, great place, great people. Nice location prices are  good. We spent $60 for 6 of us and got beers. Plus guacamole made at the table. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone and know they will be satisfied and get treated right"}
{"text":"Service was very attentive as the waiter checked back several times. But the food was pretty average. The chile relleno plate was good but really needs two chiles given the size of them. My wife wanted mole chicken but that dish is described as a chicken leg so if that is the size of a grocery store chicken leg, probably not too sizable. She had mole enchiladas instead which was a good amount of food but average in taste.  She reported her margarita as strong but not as good as at other establishments in town. (To be fair, also not as expensive).  I would say Los Compadres has decent food at competitive prices but we didn't find it living up to the generally excellent reviews from others."}
{"text":"Ok first I need to ask, why the shower stall in the men's bathroom?  Started with guacamole and cheese dip, both very good and traditional. Last place I was at and asked for the chips and quaso it was a pile of chips on a dinner plate with mozzarella cheese that that chef mic (microwave) made, needless to say they are out of business.  My wife had an all natural  (not from a mix or bottle) margarita that she call \"refreshing on a hot summer day\".  For dinner we had chile rellenos, shrimp fajitas, and an enchilada served with bean and Spanish rice (same recipe I make with green peas and carrots), everything was delicious.  Definitely worth stopping back the next time we are in town.  But please tell me why there is a shower in the bathroom?  Side note, I got my wife to start reading Yelp reviews and our dinning experiences have been 9's ever since. Keep up the great reviews fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant ever. I come here once or twice, sometimes even three times, a week because it's so good and I am always craving compadres. The enchiladas with the compadres sauce is heavenly. Their rice is cooked to perfection with a nice addition of some beans and diced carrots. The tacos are also fantastic as well. I also recommend the horchata, it's sooooooo good!!!  I also love how the food isn't overly greasy or anything either. I usually feel bloated or gassy when I eat Mexican food but with compadres I don't. (Maybe TMI but whatever). The waiters and waitresses are always super friendly and kind.  And also students get a 20% discount during lunch time.  I love this place so so so much and wish I could eat here every single day for every meal... I'm probably obsessed but do yourself a favor and get the enchilada with compadres sauce with seasoned chicken.   Oh and I almost forgot to mention the complimentary chips and salsa. They are sooo good and fresh and every time I come the chips are slightly warm from freshly frying them and the salsa is extremely fresh and delicious. The extra spicy salsa is amazing too. It has a great kick to it.   Overall, I love you compadres"}
{"text":"I went with a friend last night after reading the reviews. Everyone was right. The staff was very welcoming and professional. The menu has the usual standards, but also many other dishes. This is not just a burrito and taco place. The food was fresh and very good. They make guacamole tableside. I'm going again tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is my Mexican food heaven!!  Tried it for the first time today and although I've been stuffed for 6 hours it was muy bien.  The queso was insane and veggie quesadilla was out of this world.  This is a very dangerous discovery!!  The only criticism would be that the food was a bit greasy but that's hardly a reason to complain.  Hola compadres!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, seriously! Great food at great prices, we asked for extra sour cream and our waitress came back with it in a taco shell bowl instead of just putting it in a cup- it was a nice attention to detail. I had the chicken chimichanga and it was a perfect portion size and delicious. I can't rave enough about how great the service was too! I will be back here for sure !"}
{"text":"Decent food, decent staff, but its a stark corporate echo chamber.  Not a nice place to be."}
{"text":"Pluses: nice decor, fast service, and generally tasty entrees (good for pretty Americanized, standard fare--and I mean that in a good way) Minuses: run of the mill, unsalted chips--have had better out of a bag, uninspired salsa, and ridiculously priced margarita given its size.  Seriously, there were like two shots of margarita on the rocks for $6.95 or something.  Also were charged a couple bucks for extra sauce requested on the side.  Felt \"nickel and dimed\" for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here one time so far and based on that experience I loved it and will definitely be back. I started with a margarita and for my meal had one gordita and one veggie tostada rice and beans. Both delicious! I really liked the ground beef good flavor! The gordita is kinda messy but worth it the fried thick shell and combination of meat and all the toppings..it's just so yummy. The veggie tostada has actual veggies on it like squash cauliflower and carrots. Didn't think I'd like it but I loved it! No complaints here! Staff was really friendly too and I like the layout of the place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"You know? I don't really remember the food being amazing. I don't remember the food much at all. I DO remember being there for half an hour waiting for a table while other parties (with the same number of people--4) were seated ahead of us and we were ignored when we tried to get drinks while we waited at the bar. No one apologized for the wait. I understand busy times. But I also appreciate a smile or an \"I'm sorry it's taking so long,\" kind of witness to our waiting. We got none of that.  That would've been the end of it, but when we finally got to the table and the waitress took our drink orders, our DD asked for a small margarita. The waitress actually haggled with her, attempting to shame our DD into ordering a larger drink. Not just once. Not twice. But THREE times, she went back and forth with our DD -- who politely declined every time. That's really uncool.   I had been excited to try the place, because two of my friends raved about it. But I don't intend to go back. In the end, it's not the food I'll remember."}
{"text":"The second (& 3rd) time we came here we got the pastor tacos (him) and veggie quesadilla (her). It will be extremely difficult for either of us to EVER order anything but these respective two dishes. Done."}
{"text":"This restaurant was three star through and through.  Good service, good food, good drinks, nice hot sauces.  Nothing spectacular, also nothing bad.  Middle of the road all the way for me.  I liked the attempt to elevate mexican food.       I ordered several vegetarian sopes, my wife had the carne asada, and my daughter had the quesadilla.  We all agreed it was three stars."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation of food. Tasty sauces. Everything made fresh. Great service. I like the authentic music and contemporary interior."}
{"text":"Extremely quick service, and the perfect sized burrito. Just big enough so that you can get a descent amount of all \"the goods\" in one bite and not just a bite of the lettuce! I got the steak burrito, which was the meat the waiter recommended. Only thing lacking was they didn't serve any red or green sauce with the meal, and we all know that the sauces can make or break a Mexican restaurant :)  But, the meal was still way above average plus the waiters were efficient and very nice. I would definitely go again. And hit up some tacos maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Great food! The sour cream as a side even comes in a crispy shell bowl which is adorable. Service was awesome too- our waitress was very patient and kind! Will definitely recommend this place to family and friends in the area!"}
{"text":"1) the staff is so nice! they always check in making sure everything is tasting right and if you need anything! 2) the horchata is very flavorful and good!  3) the enchiladas verdes were flavorful too and delicious!  4) you're getting  a lot of food for your money!"}
{"text":"Went in alone, sat at the bar got a glass of wine and ordered take out. Food was ready super quick. Ordered a Mexicano Burrito with seasoned chicken. Taste was amazing and the service was very friendly. I'll for sure be back many times!  The inside was nicely decorated and very clean. Plenty of space! Thank you for setting up in downtown Middleton, I needed this yummy food walking distance from my home!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and MAN was the service fantastic. I mean, wow. We all left SO DAMN HAPPY. From the host to the person who ushered us to the table to the waitress and the table side guacamole chef - all were spot on. The food was fine - but I'll be back for their over-the-top service."}
{"text":"After my first visit, I am a huge fan and this now may be my favorite mexican in the Madison area.  Everyone at this family owned restaurant are super friendly and the food is outstanding.  I opted for a sope, gordita and a vegetarian taco.  The shell for the Sopes and gorditas are made in house and served as an excellent platform for the rest of the ingredients.  The pastor on the sope really highlighted the marinade-bright and sweet.  The chicharron in the gordita was amazing-fatty and rich without being greasy, I would easily get it again. And finally, a first for me (and not the last)-a vegetarian taco.  Holy cow. Sauteed squash, broccoli, cauliflower, onion with rice and beans wrapped in a double homemade tortilla.  As a card carrying carnivore, I could eat these each and every day. With great staff and great food, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"Yummmm. Complimentary chips and salsa were very good. Fresh guacamole made at your table? Yes please. Queso dip was delicious too. I got 2 tacos -- 1 pastor, which was 5 stars. You can tell I loved it because I took a bit before I even snapped a picture. Traditional Mexican style with cilantro and onions. The shrimp tacos were 4 stars -- maybe some sauce would've put it over the top. Really friendly servers too. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We were really underwhelmed.  We went on a fairly busy night but were seated right away.  We had a party of 5 and tried a fair number of items.  Our first complaint is that our server was terrible.  It did seem like the other servers were great, so perhaps we just had bad luck.  But our server was bad enough that we'd probably never return.  The food?  Tasted like standard Mexican restaurant food.  There are two taco shops in Middleton with considerably higher quality food.  Hoping we went on a bad night, but we expected this to be a step above and it definitely was not."}
{"text":"Menu is enticing and the service is excellent, but I found their signature fajitas to be pretty bland. My companion had the chicken mole enchiladas - these were much better. I did enjoy the complementary salsa. Compadres is probably worth another try."}
{"text":"Authentic family owned and operated restaurant that is hands down the best place to grab lunch or dinner in the Madison area. They hand make guacamole at your table! Food is delicious, especially the tacos at lunch. They also have a full bar and make excellent mixed drinks. They've only been open a few days and I've been back three times! They are that good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The food is REALLY good and the complimentary chips and salsa is nice. I get their enchiladas verdes, their fajita burrito is really good too big portions. My only complaint is not having horchata when it is listed on the menu and I had asked for flan last night, but they didn't have that either. Other than that, every thing else is great! Cheap prices too!"}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Mexican place in the Madison area. Has authentic options and great spicy salsa! Definitely kid friendly and our boys loved their tacos."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Visited for lunch on Sunday and can't wait to go back!! When you first walk in you just see the bar with some seating. It is rather 'sterile-looking' but I like it, it's clean and sharp. We arrived early so we ordered a couple of margaritas; mango and strawberry. They were good but I might splurge for the fresh juice option next time.    The back portion of the restaurant mirrors the front and offers a a ton of natural light. Service was a little spotty, sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I wanted. The woman that made our table-side guacamole was very friendly and sweet. She mentioned how they've been busy since they opened 8 months ago.   All of us loved our food; between the 5 of us we had a good sample of their menu. My dish was incredibly fresh and had the perfect amount of everything; chicken, sauce, rice, beans. Took half of it home, love getting two meals out of one =)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of all the glowing reviews for a place that has been open only three weeks.  Whether the reviews are legit or not, this place is good.  Another review hinted at \"Tex Mex\" which makes me think of Larado's (which makes me think of a rock in my stomach), but this is more of the Taqueria El Jalapeno-style Mexican, and a step up from Tienda Los Gemelos style Mexican (and a step down from La Mestiza Mexican... but I would gladly eat at any of these places, any time!).  Wife liked it because it has more than the standard tacos/burritos/enchiladas than a lot of places (she got shrimp).  Kid one liked the chicken strips.  Kid two liked the monster sized burrito.  I liked the chicken molé.    Between this place, Gloria's, and Taqueria Gonzalez, we're doing pretty well for Mexican in the west-side / Middleton area!  And as others have noted, staff was nice, enthusiastic, and friendly, and the food came out fast and reasonably priced.  Hopefully the'll add some stuff to the walls and ceiling to dampen down the sound in the main dining room over the next couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Don't take the best pictures, BUT....Great environment. Very clean and well presented.   Two salsas were served, and told an even hotter was available. The default hot was enough for me. Chips and salsa homemade.   The margarita was enough to get my attention, but not overly tequila, lime, or sweet. I usually cannot have more than half a margarita without heartburn, but this left me wanting another.   Split the fajitas, which was more than enough. Meat was well spiced and flavorful.   The owner was active, which is a huge plus. He introduced himself and was very friendly.   I've been looking for great Mexican cuisine in Middleton/Madison area and this definitely hit the spot!  Will go back once my girlfriend and I have another free night."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a higher rating. The food is certainly five stars.   Chips and salsa arrive at the table soon after your seated. Both salsas are very good with the red being very mild and the green with a slight hint of heat. I would have liked a spicier, hot salsa with a bite and will ask if they have one on my next visit. The menu is large with a nice variety of enchiladas, tamales, burritos, fajitas and more. The portions are very generous. The enchiladas verde are excellent. The rice and bean sides were bland and average. The steak fajitas arrive sizzling hot with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, sour cream and guacamole. Large enough for sharing.  I cannot recommend the margaritas. They are week, pre-made, and flavorless. Save your money as they also add so much ice to the glass that there's really no room for any liquid.  Now, the service. Saturday afternoon @ 2pm. We were seated, served chips and given menus immediately upon arrival. After eating most of a basket of chips our server arrived for our drink order. We ordered margaritas and water. We got the margaritas and had to ask for water a second time. They did bring it, but only one glass. Food arrived very quickly after we ordered. It was a long wait between finishing lunch and receiving the check to final payment.  I hope they fix the staffing problem soon as I'd hate to write this one off my list."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit here. Good food, excellent service and very clean. Try the guacamole made at your table, well worth the price! We will be back."}
{"text":"The Compadres Special was descent.  Large serving sizes and the staff were friendly and attentive.  The A/C wasn't working while we were there so the dinning area was very hot.  They offer a hot and mild salsa that were less chunky and more thin."}
{"text":"Always eager to try something new (especially Mexican cuisine) my fiance and I ventured here on a very hot Tuesday. It was around 95 degrees outside, when we met we found out that there air conditioning was broken. This was no problem for us as I cooled off with a Mango Margarita.   The mango Margarita definitely had a strong tequila flavor but was still sweet and refreshing. We sat at the bar as it was closest to the open door. This way we could get a little breeze. Even though it was a Tuesday and the AC was out they still had quite a few people eating and coming and going to grab food. I took this as a very good sign. You get chips and salsa to start off, they gave us both a red and green salsa. Both tasted homemade and really fresh.   For food I ordered the Enchiladas Compadres; enchiladas stuffed with grab, shrimp and roasted bell peppers. They were topped with roasted tomatoes sauce and served with you traditional rice and beans.   These hit the spot, they were flavorful but not super over powering. Everything tasted like it was made very well and the flavors went well together.   I'm excited to add this to our list of taco/Mexican restaurants we go to!"}
{"text":"A new favorite for us! With guacamole made fresh at your table, margaritas with real lime juice, and food so incredibly good it's easy to see that this locally owned business is anything but average. Service is excellent and if you are on a lunch break or bringing the kids for dinner food comes quickly. If you are wanting to visit or sit for a while, there is no pressure to hurry either, the owners/staff want you to be happy every time. We definitely have been very impressed and are happy to recommend Compadres to our friends and neighbors."}
{"text":"Great new place in Middleton. Great service and amazing food!! Best pico de gallo I have ever tasted and the guacamole was great too."}
{"text":"Better than I expected! Agree with another Yelper that said it's one of the better Mexican restaurants in town. Our favorite Mexican tends to be from casual joints (Los Gemelos, El Jalapeno, El Sabor), and this takes that same food quality and puts it in a nicer atmosphere with more options. It's also less greasy than some of our other faves, which is nice. Prices are very reasonable.  We had our standard \"first time judgment\" meals: one plate of varying tacos and one plate of other traditional favorites. The three tacos were outstanding (campechanos, al pastor, carnitas), especially the al pastor. Bits of pineapple added a superb sweet surprise alongside the crunchy, spicy bits.  The sopes come with your choice of many proteins. I chose the al pastor and was glad I did. The beans played well with it. Sopes are fairly new to me, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. This seemed a little firmer than some others I've had. Harder to cut, but really tasty. I was excited to see a variety of tamales. I had a rojo with pork and chicken verde. Both were WONDERFUL. Light and fluffy. The chicken verde was my favorite. We skipped rice and beans, so can't comment on those.    The free chips and salsa were good (red mild salsa and green very spicy). Chips weren't greasy and tasted light and fresh. Would try a cocktail sometime. They have a good drink menu that's beyond the usual margaritas.  This is on our way home from work, so I think it's going to be a new favorite. Can't wait to try their other dishes. There was a chipotle shrimp dish that sounded really tasty, and the burrito at a nearby table looked great."}
{"text":"Super good food and great service. This California girl found a great place in WI. Definitely a weekly stop."}
{"text":"Outstanding Mexican food. The freshest and most tasteful I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of Mexican food.  Everything from the guacamole to the small salad on the plate was very good. I had the chicken enchiladas which were filled with the most flavorful and seasoned chicken.  This isn't a taqueria so don't expect cheap tacos, but if you want a flavor filled authentic Mexican lunch or dinner, don't hesitate to eat here.  I rarely give 5 stars, but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Visited Compadres for the first time yesterday with a friend who was in from out of town -- we both love Mexican food and the Yelp reviews were good so thought we'd give it a try. We arrived around 12:30, and the place was not super packed but obviously busy. The decor was sparse but nice and fairly modern. We were greeted twice promptly, and told we'd be seated momentarily, which we were. Free chips and salsa were delivered -- my companion noted that the chips seemed like Doritos without any of the cheese or Cool Ranch flavoring on them, as they were perfect triangles and there was nothing special about them. The two \"salsas\" that came with the chips were flavorful but super watery, with no chunks of veggies or even any thickness to them -- when you dipped your chip, liquid just ran off and nothing stuck. Blah. Our server (not sure of his name -- on the receipt, it only said \"Server\") had the personality of a wall: not friendly, barely smiled, and had no recommendations whatsoever. We each ordered a margarita, and were asked if we wanted a small ($6.50) or large ($9.00). When we asked about the size difference, he couldn't explain it with either words (ounces) OR his hands (???) so we decided to just try the small size. VERY disappointing -- the glass was FULL of ice cubes, and I literally think I took about five medium-sized sips before it was gone. Also, it tasted mostly like water, with very little lime flavor and clearly less alcohol. For $6.50 it was a MAJOR ripoff. On to the food. Between the two of us, we ordered the tableside guacamole, one plate of three tacos, and one plate of a tostada and a taco. The tableside guacamole was made by a VERY sweet and friendly woman (maybe one of the owners?) who chatted with us through the making of it -- her bright personality was pretty much the only redeeming part of the whole meal. The guac was yummy, and we loved that it was customizable (you got to choose which of about six extra ingredients were mixed in), but it was made with only a single avocado and a few mix-ins and not worth the $8.49 price tag -- we were not even offered any extra chips beyond those already served with our \"salsas.\" When the tacos and tostada were delivered, I was shocked: my friend's tostada was a normal size and looked tasty, but the tacos were TINY, maybe 4\" across (at least 2-3\" less than a \"normal\" corn tortilla). The filling was decent (I ordered one steak, one campechanos, and one pastor), but nothing to write home about. Our server checked in with us a few times during the meal, but made it seem like it was an inconvenience for him, plus never took any of our empties off the table or asked me if I wanted a second margarita (perhaps he couldn't see that it was empty due to ALL THE ICE STILL IN THE GLASS). He gave us our check before we were even done eating, and rushed us out at the end of our meal (even though the place was nearly empty by then) which was quite disappointing. I can't recommend this place, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food!  Plenty of vegetarian options for my wife(smh).  Service was phenomenal and the food was fast and fresh!    If you're looking for authentic Mexican in the bushy Middleton area, this is the place to go!   Owner Manny has done it right!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Husband had the fajitas and I had the steak quesadilla; the pico on the side was delicious. 6:30 on a Friday and they were slammed--service definitely paid the price. We sat at the bar and it was a constant chaotic stream of servers through the bar area, with no dedicated bartender. Would definitely go back, maybe at an off-peak time."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Compadre, and if anything, it was even better than the first time.  I had the Compadre Special today - everything was delicious, and well prepared.  The service was attentive, but not overwhelming.  At the end of the meal, one of the owners came by the table to chat and make sure that we were happy with the meal and our experience there.  I was glad to see that they were busy - Compadre deserves to do very, very well."}
{"text":"Great new spot for Mexican fare! The service was fast, friendly, knowledgeable and quick to assist. The food was great because of the huge range in available spice and some new entree choices. We ordered the ceviche in a 1/2 avocado and found it fresh and a nice change from many of the greasy, cheesy options at some of the local competition. Compadres was overall clean and inviting. It has a small but spacious bar immediately upon entering but doorways to either side lead into a separate dining area with both booths and tables. Not sure if outdoor seating is an option. This spot is a repeater for us.   Only downside for us, the side of beans and rice despite having good flavor were not quite warm enough for us. Everything else was hot and fresh. However, we liked that the rice did not have those cubed carrots or peas but instead had bits of chicken signaling a stock possibly. Lots more to try here! Margaritas next!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican around. Staff is super friendly and attentive and the owner is clearly passionate about providing great service. The food is DELICIOUS - my favorite is the taco salad, which is probably the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A group of four of us went the other night and had a really nice meal. The space is clean and spacious, and has a nice bar area for anyone looking for a casual dinner. We were seated around 6pm with no wait.  I'll start with the bad. We ordered a pitcher of the lime margarita on the rocks, and it was undrinkable. It had absolutely no lime flavor and no tequila. It was essentially watered-down Triple Sec. We pointed this out to our excellent server, and she immediately took the pitcher away and offered us something else - no questions asked. We did blended margaritas, and they were all very good. I think there must have just been some oversight with this one batch. I'll definitely try the rocks version the next time.  As for the food, we all ordered very different entrees, and they were all great. The table ordered steak/shrimp fajitas, shrimp ceviche, seafood enchiladas, and a plate of a la carte tacos/sopes/gorditas. I did the a la carte plate with the veggie tacos, chicharron sopes, and carnitas gorditas. Each was the best version of the dish that I've had since living in Southern California more than a decade ago. All of this, and the prices were very reasonable. Dinner for four, with tip, appetizers, and a round of large cocktails ran $120.  This is our new go-to Mexican in Madison."}
{"text":"We went here recently with 5 small kids.  I ordered a burrito which didn't seem like anything special.  My daughters had tacos and they were good. We were seated right away, but service wasn't great.  Still, it wasn't too expensive.  I would try other places if you have the time."}
{"text":"So first things first....this place doesn't have hot sauce.  Like...none.  I asked for hot sauce and the server pointed at the salsa they brought out with the chips.  Nah....that's not hot sauce.  Both salsas were flavorful and delicious, but how does a Mexican restaurant not have hot sauce?  The food was very fast, and filling portions.  Very clean inside, and everything was groomed very well for a new place.  It was nice to have plentiful vegetarian options, but still...very odd to eat Mexican food without hot sauce.  If you are looking for authentic, there's definitely better places around here.  This was definitely a more blandish Tex-Mex style of food, but the demographic of the area probably would argue that it's plenty flavorful, so maybe they toned down the flavors for their locale...  If I wanted to sit and eat chips and salsa, I'd come back here, because they're salsas were wonderful...but I'm not sure I'd come back for the food."}
{"text":"Best Spanish food so far in Madison area hands down enchiladas,chimichangas burritos and there cheese and chorizo dip is amazing. Also give a 5  because the staff are nice and make sure your comfortable and happy with your order. When you cook authentic it's very hard to find but this place has it all even the"}
{"text":"One of the best of Dane county.   I would recommend this place to everyone, even knowing they don't have hot sauce."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a new, slightly upscale Mexican restaurant to arrive - loved it - friendly staff - great decor - food was good - drinks were really good - I'd a Mojito my wife a natural lime Margarita which I tried and it was delicious - I'm so glad they offer that option as often they have a somewhat chemical taste and I don't want to drink a funky color or taste - equally we don't usually do dessert at a venue like this, we did try the homemade flan and it was excellent - we were kinda pleasantly surprised - but went because of the good reviews but had seen the \"opening soon\" signs - pics next time - oh and it was really affordable - we shall return!"}
{"text":"Yum! I love their mango margarita on the rocks. Get the large size because you'll finish the regular size really quickly.   They bring out chips and salsa. Just a warning about the green salsa. It's really good, but it has a kick. If you're not into spicy stick with the red. If you're unsure, wait until you have a drink available before trying the green. You have been warned.   So far I have had the taquitos and the enchilada verdes. I highly recommend their taquitos. They have a nice crunch. I chose the chicken and it was good. Tender and flavorful chicken inside the fried outer layer. Tasty! The enchiladas were good too, but between the two, go for the taquitos.   The service is outstanding! The people actually enjoy what they do and are happy at work. The last time we were here, there was a longer wait. They apologized and thanked us for coming and waiting.   I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Local restaurant that we learned about from my 13 year old son. He's never recommended a place to eat so it made me pause and look up the reviews which were good so we tried it.   We had the Compadres enchiladas and compadres fajitas. The difference in the compardres version is that you get a combination of meats: beef, chicken, shrimp, and pork, versus choosing one. Both dishes were great. The fajita alone was enough food for two people. It was harder to tell which meat was in each enchilada but they were tasty just the same. Free chips and salsa served before the meal was nice. Margaritas on the rocks didn't have as much flavor as I'd like. Our server was great. Very attentive and helped us first timers with suggestions. Relaxed atmosphere. The prices were very good for the the quality and quantity. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff, the food, the drinks. Unbelievable! What an excellent place to grab a quick lunch or a nice dinner. This is without a doubt a gem in the Middleton Area. If you haven't been here it's a must. The food is 100% authentic and tastes like a home cooked meal.   The restaurant itself has beautiful natural lighting with with a modern twist.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For Mexican, this place is tops for the west side.  Fair prices, clean interior and great service.  I love their \"lil jug\" drink, like a fresh take on a margarita.  Table side guacamole is generous and delicious and the fajitas were sizzlin' and wonderful."}
{"text":"If you like authentic food and a nice classy atmosphere, this is a great restaurant in Middleton. The enchiladas are delicious and the staff is kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I love this place. Very family friendly. Have been there multiple times and would definitely go back."}
