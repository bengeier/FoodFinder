{"text":"I had the Busby Siegle (beef aujus)  roast beef was slice thin and tasteless maybe If I had order aujus on the side it would have taste better.  Good thing I had salt an pepper to help the bland taste. Also a over flow of spicy mustard on roll."}
{"text":"Was greeted as soon as I walked in by the guy making the hot dogs.   Great value!  The hot dog was delicious and was only $2.99-3.99!  Apparently a hot dog store from Detroit."}
{"text":"We got a Groupon to use while we were visitng over Thanksgiving.    The two things I didn't like is that you can't do your own condiments and the fries aren't listed separately so I didn't even see them until we were leaving because they are listed in the middle of the entire menu.  I got the hot link and it was really good but I didn't like the chopped onions or relish. My son liked his regular hot dog but I wasn't impressed with the bite I tried.  My mom and  my sister didn't really like their items (polish and a chili dog)."}
{"text":"Hotdog had a nice snap to it but the chili was low grade with lots of onions tossed on it to hide the low grade chilli for the price you pay your better off going to weinner schnitzel  as far as Staff top notch super friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Tip. One of the male cashiers, says he's from jersey, is slow changing people to dump it in his tip jar. After giving him my cash it was about a whole minute of just a stare off till he finally gave me my money.   He did it to a couple people in front of me and did it to a old man and his wife for over $7. Total dick"}
