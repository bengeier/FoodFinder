{"text":"The place wasn't too packed and I think that's what they are trying to do as well. You might miss it, if you don't see the lantern outside, so keep an eye for that. The ambiance is amazing with all the decor and just the right amount of dimness. I went there with my boyfriend and it was a date night. The music is not too strong, so it's nice to have a little chat with drinks. We had the cheesecake, and two drinks. Mine was a bit too sweet but my boyfriend's cocktail was amazing. They had a little show for that as well with burning a little wooden stick to create smoke. The taste was quite similar to old fashioned but it was really good!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and music. Great place for private conversations, drinks and late night gossip."}
{"text":"Swanky hidden gem! It all starts outside-you could walk right by the plain wood storefront, but stop when you see the Japanese lantern. Enter into a tiny traditional inspired snack bar but don't stop yet...walk right on through the black curtain like you own the place and step into the black candle lit lounge. Let your eyes adjust then follow the candles downstairs to the sweet bar. Pop down at the counter or grab a booth and peruse the cocktail menu which features many interesting sweet and savoury mashups. My gin based cocktail with seaweed was both herbal and a touch salty-tasty! You can also find a couple Japanese whiskys and sake on the menu. A hip place that gives you a taste of Japan :)"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks with friends and totally loved the cool, dark and stormy-like ambience! Although the music is a bit too loud if you're there to talk to people, the overall vibe of Gokudo was very chill. We only got drinks and edamame so I can't really speak for the items on the menu, but would definitely return to try it out. Cocktails were creative and interesting (And although mine tasted like dish soap, it quickly grew on me) while their caramel whiskey was super yum (although a little steep at $17 for what's basically a shot). Cute place, awesome service, cozy vibe, but slightly expensive. Will definitely be back for some food and will update my review when I do, but for now, 4 stars! Be wary of long waits by the way!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance if you like dark specialty bars.  The name isn't even in English on the outside, so just get the address right and walk in at the Japanese lantern.  The entrance looks like a full sushi bar but they actually only offer a limited food menu.    I tried the edamame (steamed soybeans) and it has some kind of seaweed and seasoned sprinkle (okake) that is a little fishy.  I lived in Japan and just salt is amazingly good, so I'd rather they stick to the standard.  I think I tasted a little butter as well which would be an abomination if I were right.  The kani-ebi temaki (crab and shrimp hand rolled) appetizer is tiny, about two bites and not really big enough to share but it was delicious.  Make it a double order if you want to share with your date.  They have an amazing full bar and quite a few unique cocktails.  The Hojo Masako with Hendricks gin is good but don't eat the giant piece of nori.  As a garnish it's too much.  The Okame with tequila is drinkable but the orange blossom is overkill.  It's one of those things you can easily be heavy handed with and then it tastes like soap. It overpowered the lychee flavor so there wasn't any sweetness and the lychee became a dull aftertaste.  Honestly the atmosphere is nice though and even with how picky I can be I really enjoyed it and would go back in a second to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a unique place with interesting decor. The staff members were very friendly and welcoming. I had a cocktail called Shiro, which I liked, but I preferred the one called Gempei that my friend ordered."}
{"text":"Give me a cozy, quiet bar with samurai swords on the wall and delicious cocktails and I'll be a happy guy. I came across this place last summer and during a bachelor party. We went here with about 6 of our party before dinner and it was a great choice. If you come early, you can really stake out a nice spot along the Bank of couches.  They do have food, but we only sampled cocktails. Each were well crafted and had different styles. I can't say any were below an A-.  They also have lots of Japanese whiskey, which if you haven't tried, do yourself a favor and do it. Live a little!  Definitely come here if you are in town or live here."}
{"text":"Move over Cold room has competition  Eclectic mood, classy speakeasy  I absolutely loved this place- conveniently situated in the heart of Philip square next to neighbours like Escondite, Habenero and Jatoba. Surprise yourself if you can locate the cute bamboo doors and Chinese lantern in the entrance. After going in- I was kindly greeted by the staff - looked a lot like a Japanese styled take away place.  I walked down a flight of stairs into the boroughs of the speakeasy- Decor on point, classy, personal and intimate. A cocktail only bar - prices ranged from 10-15$ for a drink. I got the Goto, a single malt drink with oolonng tea- a tad on the sweet side, but enjoyed it. Our waiter was great- Jonathan personable. After  small talk - we found out that they plan on introducing Japanese styled tapas in a few weeks for finger food.   Finally a quiet,casual classy place that is not overdone with noise. I'm looking forward to coming back for a whiskey."}
{"text":"Gokudo was the first and last bar we hit on our stint in Montreal. The decor has Japanese blade runner vibes with a comfortable lounge atmosphere. The drinks are absolutely delicious. If you're looking for a Japanese spirit twist on mixed drinks, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to this drinking establishment, not quite a Japanese speakeasy but certainly reminiscent of one. Upon passing through the curtained off front entrance, we sat at a tiny knee-height table in a darkened room. Using candles and my phone to read the drink and food menus, we made our orders. Luckily there was an opening at the bar so we were able to move over there which allowed us more room and I was able to watch the bartender (Nick) expertly concocting various cocktails. I sipped on the Saigo Takamori (recommended if you like sweet drinks) and had the Salmon Donburi with salmon sashimi, a tartare and ikura. The food was good, but the cocktails were better. If you have an opportunity to visit make sure to try to grab a stool where the action is happening."}
{"text":"My friend and I were told that we could leave our phone number so that they can call us when there is a table in 30-40 minutes. Don't know what happened, but we never got that call. Not going to try this bar after this."}
{"text":"Nice spot. I like the atmosphere and the decor, though I find it a little bit too dark. It's cozy and the drinks are pretty good and affordable. When i comes to food, I would maybe change menu because I didn't find anything impressive there. I know it's a cocktail bar, but food I really enjoy when food options are abailable, and if the menu was slightly more developped, I would've given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went twice this week. I'm a fan! Drinks are awesome and well balanced. Staff is super friendly. Probably the main reason i keep coming back. I suggest having a DJ more often. :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried to go to this bar several times, and one night, we finally succeeded in gaining entrance. We went when there was a blizzard out, so it was pretty empty. Score!  We each got a cool cocktail to begin with, and I got a large salmon rice bowl.  There's a ton of interesting drinks I'd like to try next time. I didn't have high expectations for their food, but it was a great, flavourful bowl with generous chunks of fresh salmon. Then I remembered that the place was owned by the same guys as Biiru. I recommend their yuzu cocktail on their drinks menu.  And I can't not comment on their decor. Like everyone else had mentioned, I felt like I had somehow transported to Japan (although I'm sure they wouldn't have high ceilings like Gokudo does haha). Definitely a must if you're looking for something a little different."}
{"text":"Ventured out for a drink here after dinner next door at Habanera, their other location, and was graciously greeted at the door. Walking in, I was thrown off at the stark black walls but noticed the couches and distinct seating areas which would be great for groups. Further in, the tall dark bar with teal velvet seating, looked inviting and comfortable. It was only then that I noticed the \"Japanese\" artistry in the back wall, if a picture of a tiger is your idea of Japanese, and a few additional couches.   The bar menu offers a few signature cocktails including an old fashion but nothing really caught my attention. After chatting with the bartender, I opted for my favourite cocktail, dark and stormy. The drink was perfect, real ginger beer, which made my night!   The venue was empty when our group arrived at 9 pm but people slowly trickled in thereafter. The music was soft and pleasant, which made for a perfect setting to hold a conversation.   Overall, this cocktail bar is more of a speakeasy than a bar, and I didn't see the Japanese theme as predominantly as I expected, but would return for a nightcap and the great service."}
{"text":"The aesthetic in both Ryoshi and Gokudo is phenomenal. We instantly feel immersed in a tucked away corner somewhere in Japan. The bright red hues of Ryoshi starkly contrasts the darker yakuza-feel coolness of gokudo and they work so perfectly together. Every single detail is in point.  And the food? The salmon Donburi was excellent, and the cocktail menu very varied and interesting. I was 100% satisfied with my order and I will definitely return, both for the food and the incredible ambiance. You have to see it for yourself!"}
{"text":"This was on my to-try list. We came here to grab a drink before a birthday dinner. I really like the decoration and the feel of the place. Like it was described by an article, feels \"den-like\" with a giant tiger mural and some interesting pictures  We ordered some cocktails: H?j? Masako (hendrick's, nori syrup, kalamansi puree) and Mimitsuka San (gin, red grape, saint germain & cranberry) some sake and some edamame to snack on.   Everything tastes great! The staff is very nice, courteous and attentive. I will definitely come back again soon"}
{"text":"I thought this place was supposed to be hidden but it wasn't very hard to find. I had high expectations because i like biru and escondite.   My best friend took me here for my birthday on a Thursday night. We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks and shared the tuna bowl and the salmon bowl. The food was nothing special and I recommend just coming here for drinks. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I had to add soya sauce to the tuna bowl to make it more flavourful.   For drinks I had the gempei which was a mezcal based drink and the got? cocktail which tasted similar to an old fashioned. My favorite cocktail was the h?j? masako which contained of Hendricks gin and sake and rimmed with pink Himalayan salt. They also have tons different kinds of sake."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how we found this place; we had just arrived in Montreal on a Friday night and were looking for someplace to go. We stumbled across this place and took a chance.   When we got inside we were very impressed with the decor and ambiance. It had a dark and sexy vibe and was not packed. There were only a handful of people inside so we got to sit right at the bar and talk to the bartender.  I'm not a big drinker and don't really like the taste of alcohol but all the drinks that we had were amazing. I told the bartender that I prefer a sour type of drink and he had recommended a drink to me, I'm terrible and forgot the name, but it was amazing! My boyfriend I believe got the Shiro and I had a taste and it was also good.  Everyone was very friendly and as it was our first time, the bartender was very helpful in giving us a list of places to check out.  We had tried to come back after the Friday we got in but unfortunately, it was closed the times we tried to go.   Definitely would go back and would recommend anyone going or in Montreal to come try this place!"}
{"text":"As a big fan of Habanera, Biiru & co, all owned by the same group of excellent restauranteurs, I was excited to try out Gokudo. I was a bit confused, at first, as the indicated address (630 Cathcart) is the address of a neighbouring store, and there are no indications of Gokudo outside except for the Japanese lamp.  I only tried the cocktails this time. I didn't have a chance to sample out the food, but I'm sure it is excellent -- as it is in all their restaurants. The cocktails were fabulous! I tried the Goto (McClelland Islay Single Malt scotch, Amaro Averna, Oolong Tea Syrup and Lemon-Marrakech bitters), and the Gempei (Scorpion Reposado Mezcal, Midori, Shiso, Agave syrup and lime). Both were excellent, well-balanced in flavours, complex...  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Absolutely worth the detour for delicious original cocktails, and I'm certain, really good food too.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab drinks with small group... awesome atmosphere, friendly service great drinks option. Good luck recognizing the place, real hidden gem"}
{"text":"After walking past the 1 man sushi bar...we were greeted by a dark lounge and green couches, decor is on point and dj was killin it, made it very easy to keep ordering drinks. Really cool spot to end a night grab some drinks and avoid the cold in our case."}
{"text":"nicely decorated separated into a couple of different spaces which makes it feel very intimate  cocktails were excellent i am not going to lie as a bartender myself i felt a little jealous small izakaya style menu with very tasty offerings"}
