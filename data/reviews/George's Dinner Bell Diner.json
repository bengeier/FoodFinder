{"text":"I'm pretty sure that this place is closed last time i drove by.  I haven\"t been here since i was 14.  i am now 23.  I will never forget this place.  BEST prime rib.  Best soups.  Best gyros.  Best fish sandwiches.  HUGE portions.  Bigger than anyplace ever and i truly mean that.  Makes me sad that i wont ever be able to go here again :'("}
