{"text":"I was so pleased of the environment and service.The quality of the food is so good.

I seriously recommend this place if u want real south indian flavour ."}
{"text":"One of the best south indian restaurant in Toronto (Vegetarian).. I'm a meat lover but this vegetarian restaurant get 5 starts easily for its authenticity.. I taste south indian food in different restaurants in toronto but nothing compare to nilgiris.. I prefer not to go to indian restaurants in toronto because I worked in few so I know if its fresh or some reheated spicy sause crap.. I strongly recommend this place.. its better to go for buffet so cheap to try different south indian varieties.. keep in mind its south indian food (mild / medium spicy) .. its not some local sweet butter chicken naan joint.. reason I give 4 star is the line up during lunch buffet is long but its worth a wait.."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday for lunch with co workers. Buffett is Tues - Sat only. 

Food was pretty good. We 1st thought of going to Saravana but didn't regret comig here. It's tucked away in a commercial area. 

Dosa is nice and crisp and not soggy. Place is kinda dingy but can be overlooked by speedy service. 

Service is nothing to write home about but in ethnic restaurants like these.. don't expect a chatty or courteous waiter. Just Sit .. order .. Eat .. Enjoy the food .. Pay and Leave."}
{"text":"Very good Idly here. Sambar is too large for amount of idly you get if you buy the 15 or 25 idly pack. Chutney quantity should be larger but coconut is expensive so I see why quantity is kept small. They really need to renovate entrance as many first time customers might turn around when they see the peeling and disgusting ceiling with water damage. Its been damaged for over a year. You really need to fix it."}
{"text":"The service is bad. I had to keep asking the waitress for puris and dosas but she constantly avoided serving me but gave the hot ones to the nearby tables. Upset over being served with the last puri on the plate as it turned out to be cold and hard. I left it without consuming and they charged me $2 for wasting it! Will never go again."}
{"text":"A man came in with a cardboard box with logos on it and inside were puppers that he was putting in the buffet area! 
That is so disgusting. The place does not seem hygienic at all. They also have signs posted everywhere that you must wash your hands before you go to the buffet and that makes it even more disgusting. Are people putting their hands INSIDE the buffet? 

The food was completely and utterly tasteless. There's also no extra cutlery so you have to re use your gross curry spoon with the dessert. 

The dessert was not that great or sumptuous. I know it's cheap food but I need some flavor when I eat and also the whole puppers coming out of a cardboard box just grossed me out big time."}
{"text":"I think this is one of best south-indian restraurant in Toronto (GTA). I find the food very authentic. They have great options for dosa's. I tried the Rava Onion plain dosa and idli-vada sambar combo and loved it. They serve 3 different kinds of chutney's. All of them are great but I love the red spicy one. There potion size is good. Could not finish the dosa after having idli and varda (even though I was sharing it with the table). The ambience is ok..it's simple but clean. The prices are good. Would highly recommend it for somebody wanting to have true south-indian food!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 50 dosais for take out, was not cooked properly had to throw out all. Service was poor, Managers response was don't complain about the food to anyone but did not want to refund or give credit.
Terrible place, would not recommend going back!
If you do choose to go good luck with their poor service!"}
{"text":"I was craving for south indian food on a weekend so we went to Nilgiris for buffet lunch which is $11. For the price I think the options were reasonable, all south indian dishes. I only ate idlis, vadas, dosa and poori. There was no upma :( Overall the food was tasty.

Only thing I would complain about is the service. There was only one lady serving pooris and dosas which was very slow. There was a big group close to our table eating at the same time. So all the pooris/dosas would finish by the time the lady reached our table. That was kind of disappointing. 

So overall I would rate this place 3 stars. Worth one time visit."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. I'd have to say I used to be a big fan of their idli and sambar, however, their standards have slipped a bit in the last little while. i ordered the chilly idli and I expected it to be more spicy as per its name. Unfortunately, the sauce seemed more sweet and reminded me of tomato sauce.

Luckily, I ordered the paneer masala dosa which helped with my craving for spice. 

My biggest pet peeve is the service. The staff are nice but it doesn't seem like you can ever get their attention and getting napkins is a struggle. This becomes a real issue during buffet hours when you're trying to get a dosa as the wait staff are MIA. 

My partner ordered the masala tea and it was very good... we ended up ordering two, and that too on top of my mango lassi. I do wish they'd bring back the beeda they used to make. It used to be the perfect finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Food is Ok. Food is fresh as well.

But these people have no idea about Hospitality. Ambiance is cheap. It is in a strip plaza opp a south Indian temple.

We go there for good family time. And they are bound to spoil it.

Their Brampton location is even worse. Terrible service over shadows any good quality food they might have. People are very arrogant and rude.

They are cheap though, and that is the only reason they are crowded.

Will not recommend it, Rather spend few extra bucks and get a quality time with your family."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food is not that great either. You will find better south Indian restaurants in the area.

Don't even think of going there if you are not prepared for waiters passing you with food without even looking at you, when it is supposed to be Buffet on weekends.

Arrogant servers.

When I questioned one of the guys, he tried to explain their style of buffet to me.

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"We wanted to try their buffet, heard pretty good things about it from friends. So finally got to go there on Sunday. It was as good as they said.
Though the place was a little crowded but we didn't have to wait too long for our table.The d√©cor was awesome. It had a typical south Indian atmosphere, with all the wall hangings and idols. 
Overall atmosphere and ambiance was desi and nice though crowded. The tables were so closely arranged to maximise their seating space, that it was difficult getting in and out for a serving at the buffet table, without bumping into someone! 
The service was good. There was a waitress who went around every table (buffet-eaters) serving hot dosas and puris. Special mention to their soft idli, extra crispy dosa, delicious channa masala. (I was so full, that I couldn't try their dessert!). We ordered coffee as well, but it was not so impressive. 
Its was nearly an hour and a half of travel for us, but we would definitely go there again. Would recommend this place for anyone who craves a good South Indian meal !"}
{"text":"The dosa here are huge and they were delicious. Definitely the best tasting South Indian restaurant I have been to. We requested green chilli to be added for extra spice, and it was amazing. Got vada as a starter, and they were so good. Quite some wait time as they were really busy, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite southern Indian vegetarian buffet restaurant in the Toronto suburbs. The main vege menu changes daily but the staples like dosa and poori are reliably the same and deliciously fresh. My favorite has to be their vadas-- so light and airy, it soaked up all the piquant spices on my plate just so that the burst of flavors would be delivered in one bite.  I can't say that I've had anything bad there and highly recommend all to check it out. 
Seating is very comfortable but when it does get crowded, you are expected to leave within 30mins (as instructed by a table notice) The wait staff are very polite and helpful but don't expect them to check up on you every 10 mins. Who wants that anyway??"}
{"text":"Brunch 

Ambience: 2/5 .....fits the definition of a hole in the wall
Food: 4/5 
Service: 2.5/5 (Friendly, but slow)
Value: 5/5 
Repeat: Already have. Great brunch spot, supper yummy. But do note it is all vegetarian/vegan."}
{"text":"This place is my \"go to\" for a decent dosa or South Indian breakfast per se. 
The dosas here are as they should be. Very close in taste to the actual dosas in India. 
The sambar served along is hot and delicious. The chutneys are fresh and pack much flavour. There is a buffet too, but I personally prefer to order off the menu. 
The filter coffee served here is okay. Tastes like regular Nescafe. 
Recommend trying the ghee roast dosa. 

Only downside is the ambience. Restaurant lacks neatness and the decor is unwelcoming. The cash counter is an eye sore. Steel cutlery adds to this feeling. 3 stars for good food only."}
{"text":"I went here for the first and last time. The rawa dosa was served half hour later and service was poor"}
{"text":"I don't understand why it is busy with almost all Indian customers. Today would be my 2nd time visiting and I would say the hype and number of referrals that mentioned this restaurant, didn't really meet my standards when I go there. The first experience was when I ate with my family during a busy lunch hour buffet. I was very disappointed at the food, it was very soggy and quite tasteless. But then again I would hear people mentioning it and telling me that I should go back again, so I did today. Not surprisingly nothing changed. In the safe side I ordered take out. The vegetarian Briyani had a small quantity and was soggy and tasted like fried rice. The masala Idaly served with plain rice was bland and the vegetarian curries that accompanied it was quite watery and tasteless. It is a vegetarian restaurant, that being said there are quite a number of similar restaurants that are better than this. For instance Babu, samosa king, and recently a store opposite to samosa king that does take out (forgot the name) had 100x more better taste than nilgris.  I am highly disappointed at all the hype on this place, I am taking my business elsewhere in this category."}
{"text":"Good food, but cooled fast. Should play some music, felt like a cafeteria. Beautiful paintings contrast the plain tables and walls. Sambar portion REALLY SMALL, not happy with extra charge of asked for more. staff seemed to be in a rush and dropped dishes a few times."}
{"text":"Great Dosas. You MUST MUST try their chilli Idli. For real, you must. Dosas sambar and chutney are decent enough.  We come here for lunch for the buffet. it's pretty darn good. Mango shakes are good too, get one every time, they used to be a lot thicker, they are watered down now, still pretty satisfying though. Overall: good south indian food in the Markham/Scarb area."}
{"text":"The food and variety are great for the price.  The only problem is the service.  Its really bad and they make you feel really uncomfortable. ."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday morning. The craving was for dosa. Ordered Mysore masala dosa and regular masala dosa. Both were very delicious. Were served with sambar and 2 types of coconut chutneys. The amount was generous and sambar was very flavorful."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with an impromptu dinner at The Nilgiris. 

After a quick stop at an ethnic wear store down Markham rd, at about 8:30 p.m. we started googling options for dinner. The Nilgiris is where we were directed. A short drive north...

We ordered the chili idli. Idli is a sourdough sort of small disc of soft goodness. It came to us fried, and doused in sauce with veg. It was very good. I am now starting to wonder if it was even idli or if it was tofu but either way it was very tasty and very flavour filled. Great dish. Great take on a traditional food, in a unique way.

We ordered two dosas. I had the regular masala dosa, not much spice, how I like it. He ordered the gunpowder dosa (Spicy!).

the dosa was huge, I could only finish half of mine. I did indeed find the sambar's were very tiny servings. 

The mango lassi was amazing. The filter coffee and the south indian tea was also a great end to the meal. Very traditional, served in metal cups to strain to temper the heat. 

The bill was the greatest part - very inexpensive. Under $30 for app, two entree, two drinks, two hot drinks.

Service was great. Restaurant is in an industrial looking area. Very spacious and interestingly decorated. It was an hour till closing and we were one of three families eating here. It was quiet and I do not know if I would come back if it was busy. 

I want to try the Brampton location next as it is closer to home. If ever in Scarborough, I would return here."}
{"text":"In terms of the buffet,

- Food: There is a huge variety of South Indian food here! Their dosas and puris are fresh as a server comes around and asks you how many of each (dosa or puri) your table wants. The \"rava kheer\" is delicious, slightly over-sweet but that might just be my taste. It is a dessert made primarily of semolina, raisins and cashews. A second dish that I thoroughly enjoyed was their eggplant curry! It was delicious and had a very unique South Indian taste.

- Service: Servers get overwhelmed with the number of customers during the lunch rush, that it becomes hard to attract their attention for some dosas sometimes!

- Seating: Nilgiri's has expanded their seating from their original. Based off of a quick estimate, it would be around 20 tables that seat 4 people on average. This is good as you have a good chance at finding a seat for your group.

In terms of takeout, their 50 idli option has been tried and true for many years. It is great as a catering order for events.

- Parking: For whatever reason, there is NEVER enough parking in this plaza... finding a decent spot has started to sound similar to finding a four leaf clover.

Overall, we have been coming to Nilgiri's for quite a while. Their prices are the best out of many South Indian buffets, and they have established their quality."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now, the first was with friends and this time it was with family. We didn't get to seat down and eat, but decided to get take out. We ordered the usual Mysore Masala Dosa. I will be honest I have had better dosa else where. But it isn't the worst. The sauces they gave us with our take out were alright, they lacked spice. The service at this place isn't the best my food was ready and sitting there for at least 10 mins and then the gentlemen at the front called me to grab my order. During those 10 mins he was talking to an other employee about some personal matter. Overall, the dosa spot is alright."}
{"text":"This is not the usual Indian food served in most restaurant in North America. They are from Madras and serve only vegetarian southern food.
The place has around 20 tables and several waiters to help, as you work your way to the buffet with around 10 or 12 items. However not a single item was something I ever had in any other Indian place, 
They have a menu with around 30 choices, all of which are vegetarian.
The place is quite crowded, and if you are a \"gringo\" you could be the only westerner there, which I suppose tells something positive about the quality of the food. 

Since I don't look Indian, I was asked if I \"really\" wanted to eat there. You bet!

Two Hindu temples surround this restaurant.
Don't be fooled and try!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternon.  The good:  the doshas are huge and good.  The bad, they don't have a thali platter except for take out!  They told it's because they have a luncheon buffet.  It was pretty good (hubby has this) I had the coriander masala dosa.  Anyhow, they cooked fresh poori's and had mini dosas at the buffet.  I think anything on the menu is there at the buffet so it's worth it if you want to try a bit of everything (lemon rice, curd, sambar etc)  
Hubby was the only white guy in the place ...we took this as a good sign! :)"}
{"text":"It has a good south indian buffet. Went for lunch and enjoyed all the items in buffet there. Service was ok. Its the food which i liked so 4 stars"}
{"text":"Great food. The south Indian vegetarian buffet on the weekends is outstanding. Such a treat to have home style curries & vegetables. Their chutneys are distinctive & their sambar is superb. The dosas, idlis. & vadas are of course very good. Try their idli65. The south Indian coffee is too milky. So ask for strong Madras coffee & you will get a good one. One of the best south Indian restaurants in the GTA. Unfortunately in the last year their quality has dropped & they fluctuate a lot. The serving staff turnover is high & they are not always friendly."}
{"text":"I've heard decent things about the Nilgiris so we came here on a Monday afternoon strictly for some dosas. For those of you who don't know, dosas are essentially Indian cr√™pes. They are awesome. My go to is the Masala Dosa:  spiced potatoes in a crisp crepe. Eaten by smothering in coconut chutneys and sambar. 

There were plenty to choose from (there were a page and a half of different dosas) and I would definitely return to try the other varieties. We ordered the tried and true Masala Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa which is a dollar more ($7.49 vs 8.49). They were good. While tasty and satisfying, the Dosa crepe was fairly 'short' in size. I also felt that the crepe could have been much more crisp and warm as well. You can definitely find better dosas elsewhere. 

The service wasn't as bad as others have said but then again there were only a handful of tables with patrons. However, there were a handful of tables that still had their tables dirty with plates and cutlery during our entire meal. It would have been nice for them to get those out of the way.

The place is a bit tricky to find as it is not facing Markham Road. Rather, it is inside the plaza called the Markham Mcnicoll Centre. Once you enter the plaza you should see it on your left, with a big sign."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate the anniversary of my BF's parents. 

The food was very tasty but sadly the service was seriously lacking.

My bf's family made a couple of small requests (dosa fillings on the side) which were all but ignored. By the time everyone's meals had arrived, people were just too hungry to send anything back.

If you don't mind rude/uninterested slow service with tasty food, check this place out."}
{"text":"Had some delicious south indian food for dinner here. The restaurant transports you back to india in atmosphere and food. We started out with their methu vadai, which was served with chutney and sambar. Every plate comes with 3 vadai so two people can share. It was soft and delicious - which made it a great start. 

For entr√©e, I had the spring dosa filled with cabbage, carrots and other veggies. It was a proper size entr√©e and I was satisfied with portion and taste. Finally , we got filter coffee to finish off. It was good , just as I expected. Service was quick and friendly enough. They have an area where they sell snacks and do take out orders in front of the store. 

I would recommend it for authentic south indian taste and also for south indian atmosphere. (Which is somewhat noisy to loud to north American Standard. But for me that's part of the whole experience)
Price is affordable, food is good and service is okay = nilgiris :)"}
{"text":"If I were to go on space alone I would give this South Indian restaurant 4 stars. It reminds me of some really authentic Southern restaurants from India. Kudos on the great service and the authenticity of South Indian-style steel dishes and flatware. 

Aside from that, the lunch buffet is pretty solid although not the best I've ever had. The servers do their best to take orders and hand out hot dosas as if there was a fire.

If I could give the owners some personal feedback, I'd recommend an extra emphasis on presentation and dessert to breathe some life into their spread. (I'd love to see that Kesari Rava that makes the rounds at Sarvanaa)."}
{"text":"Best southindian foods hands down.really busy so don't expect good service!food is awesome"}
{"text":"this was my first time going for the south indian food. 

For $6.99 lunch buffet (during weekdays) there was not a huge buffet selection however what ever they were serving was yummy. 

Restaurant space however is very congested and was very hard to get the food stations. Other than that it was a very good trip."}
{"text":"I ordered poori with vegetable korma, it was delicious. My problem was the portion size of the curry to the two large Poories. Did not like the curry portion size, it was way too small. Plus the damn mango Lassi I ordered looked like it is extra small size. Please don't cheap out on portions."}
{"text":"This place is only good if you are planning a take out. Dining in is not recommended - service is bad and patchy. The servers are always in a hurry. I have tried a few other places in the nearby areas (such as Sarvanna Bhavan) and this place is below standards in terms of quality of food, service and ambience. I also tried the Paratha with the veggies that I found spicy. The Dosas are not as crisp as you would expect them to be. The folks can definitely up the bar in terms of quality. There are hard core fans of South Indian good and they would love to see this place do well."}
{"text":"My family decided to purchase some of their dosa batter... it gave us all food poisoning. It was literally the only thing we ate that night so I know that dosa batter is what made us all sick a few hours later. We called them and were told the manager \"wasn't there\" but would call us back. Of course, our call was never returned. The food is stale anyways, overpriced chai--you could get a cheaper $1 cup another place that is just as good."}
{"text":"ORDER: Masala Dosa, Sweet Lassi (don't get it), mango shake

Pros:
- Huge selection of food; from my understanding, they have a buffet (I believe at lunch time), however I've always stopped by for dinner, never lunch
- Offers interesting novelty foods- masala dosas are definitely different from the typical perception of \"Indian cuisine\"
- DISCLAIMER: When the menu reads \"SPICY\", trust me when I say... IT IS REALLY SPICY. I've ordered dishes here that didn't even state (on the menu) that they were spicy, but they were. Their dishes make my tongue cry sometimes... 

Cons: 
- Restaurants that offer meat dishes typically offer vegetarian options... why is it not the same vice versa? The Nilgiris is an all vegetarian restaurant
- Service has gotten worse over the past year (I'm a regular). Their waiters used to be girls who were more attentive to customer needs.
- This isn't necessarily a con-- but just keep in mind that you're supposed to go up to the register when it comes time to pay (they don't bring the bill to you). 

They've started to cheap out. I used to receive potato salad with any/every meal that I ordered here and they've taken that away. Also, the last time I ordered masala dosa, they cut my meal up into rectangles... WHY?! The waiters also tend to listen to my needs/orders and don't come back at all. If that's the case, I'd rather settle for typical indian cuisine where my needs as a customer are met . NO SIR, I DON'T WANT SOME MORE."}
{"text":"The Nilgiris has been around for many years.  We were here for the lunch buffet, it is vegetarian only.  There is no dinner buffet.  The prices are :

$11 weekdays (minus $2 if you don't waste any food)
$13 weekends and holidays (minus $2 if you don't waste any food)

Indian food is delicious, even if it is vegetarian only.  Most of the dishes were spicy, including the soup which is rare to find at an Indian buffet.  The freshly brought out dosa and roti were delicious.  The Indian coffee ($2.50) was also wonderful.  Lots of people here, you can tell business is good.

We would have liked to see more food options, paneer for example is a popular vegetarian dish.  Still it is an excellent buffet for vegetarians out there."}
{"text":"Updated review - have ordered from here many times in the past several months now and I find the food to be inconsistent. I still highly recommend the pooris, chapatis and thosai/dosa. The rice and curry dishes are more hit or miss."}
{"text":"Average food. Did not like taste much. I am a fan of south India food and really very very picky about dishes. Service was ok. I would rather go for other options. Idli Chilly was very dull in flavour. Coconut chilly uttapam was ok too."}
{"text":"Really very  good south Indian food! My mom had the dosa and I had a the Bombay thali! The mysore masala dosa came with the regular with a spicy spread and potato filling. The mysore style of dosa is my favorite type of dosa. The dosa was accompanied with coconut, spicy coconut, and tomato chutneys and a tiny bowl of sambhar. 

The reason I am giving this place a four stars is because of the tiny portion of chutneys and sambhar, but the dosa size was good! My mango lassi was pretty small as well for $3.50.

My Bobmay thali was delightful! I was full and very happy by the end of it. I am a huge fan of rasam, and this place made the rasam perfectly! All the veggie dishes had a unique taste, especially liked the chilli veggies! 

Also loved the fried chillies served with the meal! I love spicy food and the chillies were a nice touch. The service was good as well because that is important as well! 

Regardless whether you are vegetarian or not, this place is a jewel in Markham!"}
{"text":"Sambar portions were extremely small. Service was lacking. Dosas were on the cold side when they arrived. Taste was mediocre at best. Heard good things about this place but turned out to be a a downer."}
{"text":"Decent buffet on weekends. Food was delicious. Moderately priced with a $2 \"no waste discount\". Can't complain."}
{"text":"Called a day in advance to order onion pakoras and was told to pick it up at 12pm. Arrived at 1245pm and still had to wait 30 mins while they made it."}
{"text":"Heard good things about the place and I was in the area with the family so I thought I'd pay it a visit.

The good first.  The staff is really frendly and nice with the service being pretty good.

The bad.  The food was another story.. We ordered two appetizers and two Doas.  The appetizers were ok but the dosa were BAD.  We ordered the Masala Dosa & Coriander Masala Dosa.  Both were not at all good. 

We both had a couple of bites and that was it.  The potatoes in the dosa had no taste and overall the food was tasteless. Left most of the food uneaten.

There are better Dosa places in Brampton"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers excellent service and is a good place for a quick and filling bite; Fast-food in South Indian Cuisine.The buffet was at par and inexpensive. The variety was adequate with dosa, akin to a South Indian crepe with everything in-between, sambar, potato stuffing, subzi  etc etc. However, the dessert options were OUT of this world; EX: A milk, noodle and nut concoction-The BEST dessert option I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet on weekends; can get packed on weekends; serves South Indian food only.  Great experience to get a snippet of a cultural and local hot spot during my visit to TO.  Self-service buffet; small selection but you will be full amongst the chickpeas, rice, idls, stewed veggies and the puris and dosas the servers will pass around to your table.  Additional charges for extra drinks.  Two choices for dessert at buffet."}
{"text":"Low quality food $11 for weekday buffet. Slow service 30 min limit on busy days rush you out throwing bill in your face. Spend the extra 3-5 bucks and go sarvanabhavan you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Always good tasting food but service needs improvement. There is mismanagement with regards to \"waiting folks for seating\". Specially during peak hours they need to have a dedicated concierge."}
{"text":"3 stars for food, zero for service!

Located on Markham Road with plenty of parking in the plaza, this place has a 'around the corner in Chennai' vibe. Walls are painted dull yellow and tables n chairs are pretty old fashioned.

Their sambhar and rasam is the best I've had so far. Idli's are super soft and vada's are crisp n fresh. We get the Idli dipped in copious amount of sambhar and garnish it with chopped onions and coriander. Can't say how happy that makes me.

The lunch buffet over the weekends is pretty decent too. But why no medu vadas?

The service leaves a lot to be desired. Although the staff is amicable but there seems to be a language barrier. Now only if I was from South India or Sri Lanka I guess.

They are also pretty strict about timings. Reached at 9pm on a weekday with my parents who are visiting us but were told if you can finish your food by 9.30, you can sit. Or? I didn't want or wait to hear the rest of it.

We'll be back for food's sake though. Sigh!!!"}
{"text":"This place has good food but disastrous service. You need to be pushy here to get your food.  We had bad service everytime but keep on going so that says something about the dosa. 
For fun everytime we ask for the chili Bhaji cause they never have it. They always say we ran out. Lol"}
{"text":"Food was delicious
Authentic South Indian resto
We arrived at 6.00pm and got amazing service
Way better than Guru Lakshmi
Much cheaper than other South Indian resto"}
{"text":"I usually go to mississauga for Dosa's but came across this restaurant a few years ago and now occasionally come here.

The staff greet and seat you as soon as you enter. Very prompt service.

The only thing I dislike is the cleanliness. I often question why I keep going back based on the dishes always being dirty  I usually have to keep asking for new dishes until I finally get a clean one.

I ordered the masala dosa. It has the right amount of spice and flavours. It was slightly cold which means it wasn't served right away. Dosa's have to be eaten right away as they are fresh or else you won't really enjoy it. The sauces that came with it are so delicious. The mint one is a bit spicy for me but sometimes I mix it in"}
{"text":"While buffet didn't have great reviews we still went ahead since we were hungry. Buffet was good. 
Items I loved the most: Idli 65, set uttapam, vada, Idli and fruit custard. The two chutneys were amazing too. Idli 65 was quite spicy and very well fried not to be oily. Set uttapam - bite size - was great. Vada were most amazing of everything. Soft, hot and great with chutneys or sambhar. Idli was great - soft and kind of melt in mouth. Dosas were great too. 
Items that were okay: Puri, Spicy Potato Sabzi, Dessert. Puri was a little oily - nothing amazing. Same goes for Sabzi. Instead of dry potato sabzi, the authentic Potato Bhaji would have made a better combination with Puri. There was a dessert whose name wasn't written but I wouldn't mind not knowing it since it wasn't much good. 
Nothing so great in ambiance. Service is just fine. They give C$2 off if you don't waste food which is a great initiative - definitely works for Indians."}
{"text":"Best place for dosa and idili. We've been here a few times and every time has been good.  The curries are all very flavourful but not over salted like other restaurants tend to be. For those of you not familiar with South Indian cuisine I suggest ordering the masala dosa, idili appetizer and vada appetizer. All are excellent. Not sure how they make the idilis so light and fluffy these are way better than my moms...sorry mum."}
{"text":"I have been to Nilgiris many many many times over the years and in fact we used the catering on site service for our wedding ( dancing night before wedding). Service, food quality, cleanliness and the ambience have gone down quite a hit in last approx 2 years. 

Cleanliness is a big turn off for me and I have been seriously considering not returning in future. Food quality is much better at Guru Luxshmi than Nilgiris."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch and I didn't hate my experience here nor did I love my experience.

To begin, the service was actually pretty good. Upon arrival we got greeted and seated quickly. The staff were kind and was always around when we needed them. One piece of advice, on the board it does say if it's too busy you will have to leave after 30 minutes of dining to be fair.

So my family and I decided to go with the lunch buffet, because it was $11 (on weekdays it is this price) and if you don't waste food they will deduct $2. We thought, why not? We can try a few dishes, instead of just one. Boy were we wrong. There was hardly any selections and half of the curries did not look so appetizing! My favourite was the idli and sambar. The staff go around handing out dosa and puri, and both of them were delicious!! Definitely try the puri with the potato masala curry, which is provided in the buffet selection. For dessert, the gulab jamun was really good.

For the restaurant itself, they can certainly get some renovations done. It looks the exact same from when I walked in back when I was like 7 years old. 

All in all, I would probably do take-out or come back for dinner and just order what I actually like from the menu. I definitely recommend their idli and sambar, dosa, puri and gulab jamun.

P.S. GET THE MANGO SHAKE! You won't regret it, it was amazing."}
