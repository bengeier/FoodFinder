{"text":"Place is good I liked it ... Just don't order to go it taste different from the last two times I did that but the times that I sat down and ate there was pretty awesome food"}
{"text":"The tacos were the best thing I ordered (some of the best I've eaten in Phoenix as well.) Each type had a different topping/variety. The meats were delicious and not fatty. Place is legit! Their salsa is yummy as well. I had the gordita and didn't love it (kinda bland and lame after the exciting tacos), but I don't usually like the fried dough stuff in general.  Cheap and totally worth driving to Tolleson!!!"}
{"text":"I love their tacos and the people that work there are always super attentive and really nice"}
{"text":"This place has to be my favorite neighborhood mexican food joint. The service and food are always great. My favorite dish is the cheese enchiladas."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go to. I have yet to try something on their menu I don't, very authentic food. Not pricey at all."}
{"text":"The food is great and every time I take someone to the restaurant they always love it. It is grest to have a place that reminds you of home , especially when the owner is fromt the same old colonia. As a cenaduria, it is meant to be cheap. It is a great place to get real Sinaloense food."}
{"text":"I came here based on the recommendation from another yelper and I have to say I'm quite disappointed. The fact that the place was completely empty should've tipped me off that I wasn't in for a decent meal. I got the asada tacos on flour tortillas. The meat was a bit on the dry side and overcooked. The rice and beans were standard. The friendly cashier is the only thing keeping this place from getting 1 star. I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had the birria de res and I loved it! It had a really good flavor. My mom the birria lady of the family liked it too. Server mentioned that others have complained that it taste like chivo but i didn't think so. I may be biased as i also like birria de chivo. 

My mom ordered tacos de cabeza and they were delicious. The cabeza was tender and had a great taste. She also ordered un taco de tripa and that was delicious too. She also loved the coffee.

Service was okay. We did have to call her over a couple of times and there wasn't a lot of people. We went at around 10am on Saturday."}
{"text":"I was on my way back to Tolleson from Phoenix tonight, and made a point to try this place. I have been hunting for tacos similar to or as delicious as the street tacos in Los Angeles. This place is different but not in a bad way. I ordered 4 tacos: carne asada, pollo, al pastor, and cochinita. Each $1.50, which is reasonable. These are small tacos, which I like most. You can try 3, 4 or 5 different tacos but not feel stuffed. I requested corn tortillas, and I think they make them there. They turned out to be pretty darn delicious!

I'll definitely try this place again. 

If you're visiting from Los Angeles or California, I encourage you to try this taqueria, it's very close to the 10 FWY."}
{"text":"I love this place it's so good and there aguachile is delicious!! Everything really is good but from all the seafood restaurants I have gone to this taqueria makes the best aguachile"}
{"text":"We stopped here a while back while visiting local businesses.  I'm always up for a good taco, and it did not disappoint.  My only complaint would be the salsa - not very flavorful, almost seemed like it might have been bottled.  The green sauce was a redeemer, but I need my spice to make the meal complete."}
{"text":"Great little Spot to eat.  The food is very authentic. I highly recommend trying this place out when close to Tolleson."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall taco shop friendly staff it feels like you've walked into a taco shack in Mexico. Beware I think they may not have AC and only blow in cool air via a swamp cooler if that's a deal breaker order ahead and take home. Also they serve some of their tacos with cabbage (super authentic) and some with cilantro so if you have a preference let them know. 

Al Pastor and Carne Asada was awesome!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a taco shop and found this place on yelp and stopped by to check it out.  The staff there was very polite and super friendly, the only bad thing was once we got our food the waitress did not really come to check if we needed anything else.  My boyfriend had to get up a few times to let them know what we needed.  I just think they should be a little more attentive to the customers, also since we were the only ones there.  In regards to the food I did not think it was that great. The beans taste like can beans and not like authentic mexican beans and the rice was a little too dry, it did not really taste fresh.  I got a few tacos and the meat was not that good, it seemed to be overcooked and to dry. It almost tasted as if it had been there all day just kept warm and they just keep reheating it up. The salsas did not really have any flavor and overall I was not so satisfied with my food. I probably will not be returning, and I just think the quality of the food really needs improvement."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 steak tacos and enchilada platter. Steak was good, however the tacos were not much bigger than a silver dollar. Enchiladas, sour cream, and \"guacamole\" were extremely watery. Enchiladas were ok at best. Would not go here again if it was free. Would've rather ate a TV dinner."}
{"text":"The food was good, not a fan of the menudo but their tacos where yummy. I personally liked the al Pastor tacos! They were juicy and full of flavor. We'd come back."}
{"text":"Taqueria Cenaduria Cul
9115 W Van Buren St
Tolleson, AZ 85353

We arrived on Saturday morning between 11:30 to 11:45 am, where there was only two other tables of customers. 
There was six of us together that enter the establishment and sat at the first table. Only one basket of chip was served and one small bowl of salsa. The childrens meals were $4.85 with one entree, which included rice & beans. I asked if I could order an extra egg (ala carte) separate? The waitress said no, you would have to order another children meal for $4.85 for a separate egg. We didn't need 3 order's of rice and beans, I decided to ordered the Huevos Ranchero because it came with two eggs, so I could give one egg to one of the children, since Two had asked for eggs. We had to ask for additional silverware since there wasn't enough on the table for all of us. The waitress brought us plastic forks. (I'm assuming because we had children with us). We took the empty basket of chips to the waitress for more chips? The waitress came back and said your only allowed so many baskets of chips, on the third one you will have to pay for additional order. Recall she brought one basket for six people. When we did get our food we had to request for pepper, when one of our children got one off of another table there was rice inside the pepper. When I asked for a new pepper the other waitress said, no there's nothing wrong with it. I stated there's rice inside, she said she put it there for the pepper not to stick. (Clever). We requested for a refill on our drinks and they we're an additional $1.50 each. 
I don't recommend this restaurant, waitress had a poor attituded, the food wasn't that great and being that there we're six of us we had a good variety. Our bill was $37.50, and we left a $7.50 tip regardless of the service. I've worked in the restaurant industry and I know they don't make much per hour."}
{"text":"El menudo está muy bueno. Se los recomiendo, lo ordene para llevar y la orden fue como le pidi. Se que se olle fácil, pero cuando ordenas en muchos lugares y si pides algo extra aveces se les olvida."}
{"text":"2nd time here love it. Little aces like this make the best food. Gotta try it people."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say I had a bad experience at this establishment food didn't taste of that great save your money go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I was born in Culiacan and both of my parents are from there as well. So, it's safe say I know what good Mexican food is especially from this region. My favorite food made by my Mom are \"Gorditas\" they are very similar to \"Sopes\" for those that are more familiar with those. The only problem is that they're super time consuming so my Mom doesn't make them too often. So when I found out about this place I was excited. They taste a lot like my Mom so I kept coming. 

I invited my co-worker to have lunch there and the lady that took our order noticed we were kind of in a hurry. She asked us if we had a place to be and once we told her we had to go back to work she told us that it would be better if next time we called her ahead of time so she could start cooking them before we got there so we wouldn't have to be in such a rush. Now that is customer service ! I was so happy when she told me that. 

This place is extremely inexpensive as well we had six gorditas and two glass sodas total and we only paid twelve dollars. If we would of gone to the mexican place behind our work we would of easily paid at least twenty dollars for less food. Just the glass coke there is three dollars. So we won't mind driving a little further for better food and prices."}
{"text":"Don't let the building fool you . This is a good little taco spot . Not super pricy but had some great flavor . When I'm in Scottsdale or downtown phx . I pay closer to 3to4 dollars each they were reasonable and good try it out ."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner based on the reviews posted here. I regret that decision. The customer service was great. But the food was absolutely sub-par. I got the crazy burrito and the meat was hella fatty. The tortilla was way thin. Almost all my bites had fat in it and with each bite I lost my appetite more and more. Totally sucks. I was way hungry after dealing with the devil's armpit that is this heat. Boo."}
{"text":"I have tried every burrito, gorditas, ceviche, tacos and machaca they are all good. I have yet to eat anything that I didn't like. The staff is very nice and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had the Flautas Sinaloense and Carne Asada Fries. Everything was good and the other plates that other people looked good and I went with mostly mexicans and they liked it as well. Only thing that really sucked was that they don't sell beer or allow outside drinks either."}
{"text":"Definite hidden gem.
Since moving to AZ from CALI, I've been in search of real authentic Mexican food.  This is the place that brings me back to the awesome Mexican joints I've been spoiled with in San Diego.

Chips and salsa - freshly made and the salsa explodes with flavor.
Tortas Ahogadas - I can't even explain how delicious it was.  The sauce that drowned the torta bread was amazing.  I can lick the plate.
Tacos Cabeza- I've tried many places here at AZ. This is without a doubt the best"}
{"text":"Great food. I passed by this restaurant Monday night and saw the sign outside for Caldo De Res. The next day my husband and I decided to stop in for some caldo since it was chilly out unfortunately the caldo de res is only served Monday and Thursday but the caldo de pollo was great! we will be going back tomorrow for caldo de res! my husband had the albondigas de camaron it was a little spicy for me but it was all amazing! i cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the best little hidden gem. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is delicious. I come here at least once a week. The shrimp in garlic sauce is my favorite and the flour tortillas are the best!"}
{"text":"Tried this place over the weekend with some friends, had the champurrado and it was ok, not the best I've had but I would order it again, ordered the red chili plate with rice and beans, pretty good tortillas were good also. My hubby had the menudo said it was good. Small little place that I'm sure I've passed a hundred times before, glad I know it's there now. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food we are from Tucson and stayed the night in the area hands down great homemade food the price was cheap and the customer service was awesome I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
