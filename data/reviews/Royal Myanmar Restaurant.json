{"text":"I came here with my sister yesterday for lunch and the food is amazing.  The service was good and the owners explained their speciality good.  We tried tea leaves salad, fish noodle soup and N3.  I can't wait to come back again to try different food."}
{"text":"Service could be faster but I'm still giving this give stars because the food is 100% the best in the city. I live in the east end but would happily travel for hours to have the amazing khauk swe thoke. My father is Burmese and I am SO happy to finally have a Burmese restaurant in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Great experience  Lovely service, especially Pat who explained every  dish in detail Go for Oh Noh Kauk swe or coconut noodle soup and ketthahinn and the crispy shrimp as an appetizer   Would recommend it any day Cheers"}
{"text":"So great to have a Burmese restaurant in Toronto. It is only a few weeks old so I recommend calling ahead to check if they are open. If you're looking for authentic Burmese dishes, this is the place. We've been twice and have tried 7 dishes, they've all been great."}
{"text":"Had my husband grab takeout from here yesterday after driving by and searching for places to eat on the Internet, AMAZING! This place is only 8 months old so pretty new. Food was delicious, place was clean and the woman serving him was very nice. A lot of the food here seems to be homemade, from the homemade fish cakes we had (so good!) to the sauces and the rice noodles (from what I've read) and the portions were big enough to split one main for lunch for two people and keep you full till dinner. Lots of effort and attention put in for the food, the woman even described and explained the process of making some of the things we ordered. This was our first time here (and our first time having Burmese) and we will definitely be back. Prices were great and they have a great website with a menu and pictures and info which is key. They also have great lunch specials which we will try next time. Although I would love for this place to stay a secret, I want them to have more business and for other people to have the pleasure of eating here hah! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Second time here for lunch, and I think I'll be back every day this week!! Super delicious food, friendly service, and great prices make this place the absolute best pick for food in this neighborhood. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We'd never tried Burmese food before, but the food was delicious and the portions were huge. The meal included a soup, tea, rice, side salad & main dish which were very filling and the cost was low. We definitely didn't need the appetizer (tempura squash sticks), which we enjoyed too. We were imagining 5-6 pcs, but a massive plate came out. Everything was very flavorful.   The owner(s) were happy to engage with customers and recommended other dishes for future visits. They have a decent number of vegetarian options and we're very accommodating with food needs. They also checked in about common food allergies (nuts/fish). We had a nice chat about the different foods and an added bonus: some interesting shows about Burmese food, culture and travel playing on the screen. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loves the food and you can really taste the effort that was put into making the dish. 5/5 hands down and would definitely revisit again with more friends :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! The food was delicious and the service and care from the staff was wonderful. We were a party  of four adults and three kids under seven. We wanted to try Burmese food and we will definitely be back to try the tea leaf salad."}
{"text":"This is my fave food in Long Branch / Alderwood. My gateway drug was the coconut chicken w/ noodle & fresh veg & soup (N3). So fresh and full of satisfying flavours and textures when you mix everything all together. Sprinkle some pepper flakes in there and you're all set.  I've tried 4 or 5 other dishes now & have never been disappointed. The owner is super friendly and chill. The prices are very fair.  I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious, carefully prepared and home-style Burmese noodle soups and salads reflecting a cuisine that combines Indian and Chinese influences.  The prices are also extraordinarily affordable for the amount of effort and care put into the cooking ($6-7 for a bowl of noodle soup!).  Ordered coconut chicken noodle soup (oh no kaut see), ginger salad (Ginn thoke) and catfish noodle soup (mohinga - classic noodle soup eaten throughout Burma).  The owner makes the rice noodles fresh and sources her ingredients locally.  The ginger salad is a combination of crunch from fried beans and toasted sesame seeds, and sour and tangy from the fermented ginger and lime and sweetness from fresh shallot slices.  Ask for fresh chilies if you order this.  The mohinga is authentic - umame broth made from catfish and banana stem slices, whole sweet shallots, and seasoned with coriander leaf, lime and crunchy fried lentil \"pancake\".  The oh no kaut see noodles are satisfyingly chewy, the broth creamy and tasty.  I will be back to taste other dishes in the menu."}
{"text":"A little Burmese restaurant in Etobicoke that we visited after building up an appetite walking along the Etobicoke Valley Park bear Long Branch GO station. The decor is unassuming, simple, clean, and well lit. My partner and I shared the signature green tea leaf salad, which was garnished with crunchy toppings and had a delicious, mildly spicy and unusual flavour. Next I had the coconut chicken noodle soup which was absolutely delightful and a must-have (N3). It had regular and crunchy egg noodles which burst with flavour in the mouth along with the coconut flavoured broth, chicken ,and bright touches of fresh coriander and onion. My partner had chicken curry (E1) which was good but not memorable compared to similar Thai recipes. Definitely worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"We love the food here!  We had the Green Papaya Salad which was crispy and very authentic-tasting. My advice is to get your own as sharing it is not enough. We also had the Noodle with Chicken, Fresh Veg and Coconut and it was very tasty too. Right amount of coconut and chicken taste and the noodle itself had a really good texture. You will know based on the taste that local people cooked the food. We also had the Burmese Style Beef Curry which was just average-tasting beef stew.   The servers who look like they own the place are very friendly too.   We will come back for sure to try the other noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"I recently came here with my girlfriend on a Sunday evening. The service are slow but you cant go wrong with decent price for the food."}
{"text":"I must be outright honest - the taste isn't to everyone's liking, but the food is quite good (objectively speaking). We ordered the fermented green tea salad, the mohinga (fish soup with rice noodles), and the spicy chicken curry.  The green tea salad came first, and it consists of lots of unidentified greens and tomatoes generously slathered in oil and filled with loads of sesame seeds and fried beans and peanuts. The taste is very distinct and special! The seeds and fried beans make the dish very fragrant.  The spicy chicken came next. My dad's main complaint was that the curry wasn't hot enough... Seemed like it was microwaved, but not quite enough. There were three portions of chicken, with some potatoes, and the curry came with white rice, salad, and soup. The soup had a very fragrant chicken oil flavour, and there were mashed potato bits at the bottom. I really enjoyed the soup! The waitress was very worried that we wouldn't be able to handle the spice and so urged us to order the medium spice level... However, we didn't find the medium spice to be spicy at all!   The fish soup came last. The rice noodles are all cooked to a mush, and the entire dish screams comfort. You're meant to eat it with a spoon, after adding some lime/lemon and roasted chili seeds to your liking. It was good, and the fried bits were definitely an interesting touch. I would've preferred more soup and less mush... Haha!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here!!! My fave is the Chicken Noodle Soup - soul warming soup with a chick pea base. Very unique flavour, very delicious. I also love the fried noodle dish. The lady here is very accommodating, just ask and she'll probably make it for you!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place when we were in the west end, and it was lunchtime and we were very hungry, but not willing to settle for just any food. We checked Yelp and decided to check this place out. We were not disappointed, the food was amazing! Don't come here looking for anything fancy, but it is clean with excellent food. I had the coconut noodle soup with tofu (instead of chicken) and my husband had the shan-style noodles. I loved the soup so much that I am still thinking about how to recreate it without driving to the other end of the city. The prices are super cheap, and I even had leftovers of my soup. My only regret is that this place wasn't open when we lived in the west end!"}
{"text":"Winter hours are different from summer hours. Call ahead on weekdays, they may be closed. They close at 7pm on weekends. The service was fast and friendly but the food was just alright. There could have been music or anything else but we ate in silence and we were the only table there. I was looking forward to eating here and was hoping that this would be a delicious hidden gem... Too bad. I probably won't come back or recommend this place after my experience.   We asked for recommendations and were directed to the specials. We picked 3 dishes including the curry and fish stew. Nothing really stood out but they were hot soupy dishes and it was cold and rainy out.   Vegetarians: you can substitute the meat broth for mushroom broth but they forgot to substitute mine and there were still chunks of chicken in my dish. My stomach was not feeling good considering I hadn't eaten meat in a decade. They also gave us complimentary soup but we later learned it was chicken broth based which they didn't tell us knowing I did not eat meat. The dish wasn't waived from the cost of the bill and they apologized and continued on."}
{"text":"I've always scrolled through the restaraunt options and this place always caught my eye. After deciding to try something new I stopped in. The service I received was fantastic. After the server asked us if it was our first time she gave us a number of recommendations that we tried. The green tea leaf salad was a unique starter that tasted fresh and delicious! I ordered the coconut noodle dish with chicken. It was also great! It also came with a soup which was pretty tasty. The server constantly made sure we were taken care of. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Royal Myanmar has warm, welcoming, attentive, and knowledgeable staff on Burmese cuisine. The tea leave salad was filling with sugared nuts, seeds, roasted chickpeas, cumin, lettuce, onions, and oily dressing. The menu is filled with traditional Burmese dishes, or so I have been told they were traditional Burmese food. I tried the fried rice with yellow peas, which was slightly on the plain side. However, I am grateful to have tried this traditional yellow pea Burmese fried rice (rice had a pillow-like softness to it). Soup and mango salad came with the fried rice. I enjoyed the mango salad and the soup. The yellow  pea fried rice was dissimilar to the soy sauce based Chinese fried rice.   The atmosphere of the restaurant resembles a home with tan painted walls and overall very clean. I definitely recommend anyone to try this Burmese restaurant out!"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews for this place were so great that I had to check this place out. My friend and I ordered the highly recommended Green Tea leaf Salad to start off our meal and I didn't know what to expect. The first bite was interesting because there was a lot going on texture-wise but, I was totally into it. It had pieces of tomatoes in it so I let my friend have those since I'm not a fan of tomatoes. Up next was the Bean Sprout Fritters with Shrimp and I LOVED them. It came with a dipping sauce (probably tamarind) and some cucumber slivers. I was anticipating them to be really oily but they tasted really fresh and crispy. Then, we shared the Fish noodle soup and the Spicy Beef Curry which came with a simple soup, white rice and veggies. I found the soup to be bland but I see why it's needed because when I bit into one of the chopped peppers hidden in the curry, the soup acted as a palate cleanser. The fish noodle soup was tasty, I just needed to add a bit more salt. Overall, the experience was great and I would love to go back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"First time having  Myanmar food and it was super so good! Had the shwe toung kauk swe & ketthaHinn. So delicious. It's kind of in the middle of no where, but it's definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Really good food, even thou place doesn't look like much on the outside. Everyone is very friendly! Gives you a warm feeling of a home cooked food:)"}
{"text":"This was a delicious surprise. The people were very attentive and offered suggestions and how she would eat the food as it was my first Burmese experience. I'd say the food is find of a fusion of Thai and Indian."}
{"text":"I've worked beside the restaurant for so many years but never paid attention to it. One can be easily deceived by the restaurant's simple outer appearance. On the inside however, very nice and well put together, and quite clean. I tried the Burmese Rice noodle (Shan Khaw Swe) and that turned our really well. Portions are big for at least 2 meals. I'm definitely going back to try something else."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and both times the food was delicious, consistent, and authentic. Flavours are balanced; salt is balanced by tart and spice. I would give this place 5 stars based on the quality of the food, clean setting, and friendliness of staff; however food prep and service tends to be slow."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was quiet. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. I ordered E3 which is the beef curry with coconut rice, soup and veggies for $14.50, with crispy shrimp and bean sprout fritters as an app. This was my first time having Burmese food and it was very delicious. The food has a home cooked quality to it and the entree portions are enough to get you full for a decent price. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Never had Myanmar food before and really enjoyed my experience. The food is the star of this restaurant!  I got the coconut noodle soup (comes with sliced boiled egg, few dark meat chicken pieces and some sliced onions). The soup is rich and coconutty; sweet and delicious! Noodles quite tender and flavours are very vibrant.  The chicken curry was delicious too- very flavourful with a mix of Chinese and Indian spices.   Small business with one lady running the front of the house. But i'd come back to try their other customer favourites! Apparently this is the only Burmese restaurant in the city!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Burmese food and I'm in love. We had the coconut soup and the green tea salad. Both super yummy. The soup was creamy and comforting while the salad was spicy and fresh. We live in Toronto but will definitely make the drive to try more things next time. Just make sure to have cash or debit, they don't take credit. And don't be in a hurry. Everything is clearly made fresh to order and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"A delicious, authentic experience--no words are more fitting for Royal Myanmar. The boyfriend and I tried this place with a bias, having both eaten homecooked Myanmar food growing up, and our minds were blown. Everything we ordered tasted like the real deal--*better* homemade versions of what we're used to, and that compliment is not to be taken lightly. If you're reading this, do yourself a favor and give this place a try! You will not be disappointed. For details about our experience, read on:  One day 2 of our 4-day stay in Toronto, the boyfriend and I wanted to try something we couldn't seek out in Michigan. We had copped out yesterday and had settled for Korean food, which--albeit delicious--is a dime a dozen back in the Metro Detroit area. Imagine our surprise when Royal Myanmar topped the list of highly rated restaurants near our inn. Burmese food?! Outside of Toronto?! 4.5 stars?! We headed straight there after our 5-hour stay at the Toronto Zoo, and arrived just in time for their evening opening.  With the BF being Burmese and my own mom being born and raised in Myanmar, Burmese food to us is like feed to cattle. We entered with low expectations, and we were blown away.  Royal Myanmar's menu is divided into appetizers, salads, noodles, and entrees w/ rice. He ordered the beef and potato curry, and I got N3, shwe taung kaut swe--a soupy egg noodle salad with coconut chicken chunks, onion slices, cilantro, and crispy noodles. I'd never had this before, and was in the mood for something I couldn't compare with my family's cooking. When the food arrived, our eyes widened at the playing and the ample portions. My plate had a heaping pile of egg noodles bathing coconut soup, and was topped with all the fresh vegetables fixings, and a good amount of tender chicken thigh chunks. His rice came with a mound of young mango salad, and a separate bowl of hearty beef and potato curry. Both of our dishes came with a side bowl of complimentary soups--different types based on the flavor palette of our meal. Price-wise, we were already raving inside."}
{"text":"First Bangladeshi cuisine now Burmese cuisine, what good fortune to find such amazingly delicious food one behind another!   Ommar, the owner, was a perfect host. She (yes \"she\") explained the food, preparation, what to pair together and the manner on how to eat it. Even though she grew up in Canada, she lived with her grandparents who taught her about traditional Burmese cooking; Ingredients are imported all the way from Burma (Myanmar). It's a family business where the aunt and nieces all help out and they're all just sweet as pie.  We tried: -N3 Shwe Toung Kauk Swe - Noodle with Chicken, coconut. You need to mix it well so the sauce will be well incorporated with the noodles, bean sprouts and chicken. Great textures with the crunchy bean spouts and fried noodles, soft home made noodles and savoury sauce. I added the lime and crushed chili peppers (flavorful and mildly spicy) to add to the complexity  of the dish. - E3 Ammetha Hinn (Burmese Style Beef Curry) spicy - very mild in spice even after adding the crushed chilis. Beef is tender and comes with a yummy sauce. Delicious with the coconut rice and stir fried veggies. -The Shwegyi Sanwei Makin (Burmese Semolina Cake) tasted better warmed up and would definitely go well with a hot cup of coffee or tea. The texture and taste reminded me of a Filipino Cassava Cake: thick, dense with just enough sweetness.  The owner truly values her customers. She is even willing to tweak her recipes to accommodate dietary restrictions and will even whip up something new if you're a regular...or if you ask her nicely. TIP - if she does make a special dish for you, take a picture of it or write down the ingredients so she can replicate it for a future visit.  You might want to call on the weekends to make sure there are available tables because people from out of town come here for the food. If you're one of those out of towners and you're running late and it's about closing time, just give Ommar a call and let her know and she'll be willing to wait for you (her words).   I've only used the term \" Hidden Gem\" only once in my Yelp lifetime. This is the real deal; if you want an authentic Burmese experience then this is your place."}
{"text":"The food here is always made fresh. I have tried several of their dishes (my favourite being the Burmese style chicken curry). They have an authentic and home-made taste to their food which I really enjoy. The staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"Never tried Burmese food before and this place was close to where we were. We decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The food was well presented and the place was clean.   We ordered the shan style noodles and burmese chicken curry. Both were delicious but i thought the flavour lacked substance. Maybe that is how Burmese food really taste. I dunno since it was my first time eatting Burmese food.  I would definitely go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff but slllooooww. I like getting in and out, felt like a lot of production to get take out."}
{"text":"It was quite a discovery. The green tea leaves salad is very good. The green papaya salad as well but a little spicy. Good stuff. Nice people."}
{"text":"Truly love this place In a category of it's own Try green tea salad to start Hope for longer hours  Great ' staff-owners'"}
{"text":"When I lived in Scarborough years ago, we would frequent this restaurant near Cedarbrae Mall called Mandalay.  I would always order one of the Burmese curries because it was like nothing I've ever tasted before. When my neighbour told me about Royal Myanmar, I figured I must try it out rather than driving all the way to Scarborough.  It's located in a teensy plaza on Horner Ave.  For those of you who aren't from the hood, Horner isn't really filled with restaurants but rather a mix of industrial, low-rise apartments, residential, factories, you name it.  Anyway, I decided to order the Beef Curry, which was the special of the day. It came to $6.75 (taxes in - note: cash only).  The pic doesn't really do it justice because there was actually a lot of food in the container; I was only able to eat half the rice and 2/3 of the curry.  The curry itself was quite mildly spiced and not saucy like most curries I'm familiar with.  The meat was very tender - I could tell there was a lot of preparation that went into the dish.  What I really enjoyed was the peas soup; it was surprisingly light and very flavourful.  The best part of the dish was this dried chili condiment that was to be served on top of the curry.  It was salty, spicy, crunchy and had the right amount of heat.  I would definitely return but I would try another dish next time."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Burmese food for some time and was pleasantly surprised when I found out this restaurant was so close to home!  Full of flavour and excellent vegetarian options. You just have to ask and they will make it."}
{"text":"Took the family to Royal Myanmar this weekend to finally sample this local restaurant!  The food, portions & service are just as amazing as how everyone describes, this little gem of a business is a must visit! The dishes we ordered were mostly vegetarian except for one with shrimp for my 11 year-old, everything was superb and had a lot of flavour. Our 8 year-old is hideously picky and only ordered rice, the owner was sweet enough to make her a separate pancake-style snack, which she inhaled (THANK YOU!).  Royal Myanmar has a basket full of small kids' books, toys and interesting metal puzzles with which our kids were very busy with while waiting for our amazing food and we loved the complementary tea, very fragrant!  There is parking in front and for now, this restaurant is cash-only."}
{"text":"The Royal Myanmar Restaurant is a nice, quaint, no frills type restaurant located in away from the hustle and bustle in Etobicoke. The service is really friendly and helpful (it was our first experience with Burmese food). They made great recommendations... This is what we ordered:  Burmese Mixed Salad (A Thoke Sone)  Burmese Style Beef Curry (AmmethaHinn)  Coconut Chicken w/ Noodle & Fresh Vegetables (Shwetaung Kauk Swe)  Burmese coconut jelly (hsa*ba)  I enjoyed all the items listed above, especially the beef dish. I would suggest asking them to spice it up a bit... :)"}
{"text":"A friend told me to find a Burmese restaurant and have a tea leaf salad. This is, surprisingly, the only restaurant in Toronto to offer a tea leaf salad. IT WAS SPECTACULAR. The salad was flavorful, and the owner was super kind in explaining Burmese traditions to me."}
{"text":"We tried this as a spur of the moment choice on our way out of Toronto. The Plaza was a bit off the highway, and looked a little run down but that tells me the restaurant will probably be very good.   The menu was short but descriptive, and prices were exceptional. We ordered the Coconut chicken and Spicy lime chicken entrees.   Food was out quickly, and it was perfect. Portions were decent sized (the lime chicken was so good to me that it left me wanting more) and after dinner the owner came out to chat with us. She even sent out complimentary tea leaf salad, which was very interesting and delicious.   We'll definitely be back on our numerous trips between Buffalo and Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place for Myanmar/Burmese food. The owners are very nice and the prices very reasonable. The food was great and there was a lot of food especially if you get soup. The staff were patient and willing to explain the food to us since we weren't familiar with Burmese food.   Some of the previous reviews mentioned that there were specials but there weren't any when I went.   I have made a side note to visit this place anytime I'm looking for a meal while driving the QEW.   WiFi password is 02Burma17"}
{"text":"***In the process of getting Debit.  So currently it's CASH ONLY!***  Service, Portions, Prices - 5/5 (female owner is very friendly, chatty, & enthusiastic!) Food itself - varied depending on what was ordered, see below  Royal Myanmar has tons going for it!  It offers an ethnic food that's not readily available (Burmese), a friendly owner who was eager to make suggestions about her food - I love that!, a diverse menu, & PARKING!!!  :)  Now onto the food...  Green Tea Leaf Salad ($6.95) - Sorta like a garlicky slaw.  A texture-lover's delight, lotsa crunch!  My friend thought it was too salty, I thought it was ok.  There were peanuts, broadbeans, & peas, all crunchy.  Delicious roasted garlic taste!   Noodle with Chicken, Fresh Veg, & Coconut ($7.95) - Really big portion!  It was like a warm noodle salad dressed in coconut milk, also lotsa texture.  Don't forget to squeeze some lime on top and mix well.  Could've used more lime (acid) to bring out more taste.  Feel free to ask the owner and I'm sure she'll oblige!  Burmese Style Spicy Lime Chicken ($8.85) - Again, very generous portion.  Sauce was a red chilli-based gravy, a bit too salty and a tad too oily, was quite spicy!  I didn't taste any lime.  I think I would've enjoyed a curry more.  I didn't care for either of the side soups or the stir fried veg that came with my Spicy Lime Chicken.  I don't feel as though they enhanced or contributed to the main meal.  I'd definitely go back and try other items on the menu, most likely a Curry or a Noodle Soup.  Owner is very friendly and her personality will probably keep customers visiting again!  :)"}
{"text":"I have traveled through Burma extensively. The cuisine here is a true representative of the country. Delicious. Meticulously prepared. I love the green tea salad, stir fried egg plant and the Shan noodles. Give this place a try - you will not be disappointed. Chef Omar truly hospitable."}
{"text":"Finally found a proper Burmese restaurant in Toronto. The green tea salad was so good, must get each time.  The coconut soft and hard noodle dish was amazing. Very good flavor and texture. Have to go!"}
{"text":"A tiny restaurant, with no extravagant sign or decor. They close pretty early...around 7pm, but my craving to try a new cuisine had me rush to this place.  We entered to a restaurant with only one table occupied and, what seemed like the owner, immediately and kindly greeted us and showed us to a table.  I recently watched an Anthony Bourdain travel show where he visited Myanmar and highly praised a green tea salad. When I saw that they served that here too, I ordered it as an appetizer without any hesitation. For mains I got the Shan style noodles with chicken and my friend got some coconut sauce noodle dish (based on the owners recommendation).  The green tea salad arrived within a few minutes and though it may not look that amazing, I can whole heartedly say that it was the best salad I had ever tasted! I wanted the whole thing to myself and was reluctant to share. Apart from the impeccable taste, the different textures contributed so much to the experience, such as the random crunchy pieces in every bite.  My noodles were good, but nothing special to be honest. It tasted like regular Italian tomato sauce pasta. The serving size was pretty small too. My friend really enjoyed his noodles, which is what I'll try next time. A lovely restaurant, with a friendly owner. The only thing I would change is the serving size and the decor. But nevertheless, it's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on yelp reviews. Service was excellent! Tried the green tea salad was very good. Loaded with flavour and crunchy! Also tried the chicken noodle with coconut dish. Was tasty as well but not much chicken in it and pieces were small. The chicken was not the highlight but rather more like a garnish. The coconut sauce and noodles were the main focus of the dish. I would go back just to give the curry entrees a try as well."}
{"text":"Authentic food from Thailand, very fresh and tasty! Shwe Taung Khauk swe (N3) is a must! Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times so far and the food and service had been absolutely incredible. This place more than deserves the 5 star reviews it frequently gets.  A small hole in the wall, family run business that is located seemingly in the middle of nowhere, where people make delicious and unexplainably unique recipes is how I would tend to describe this place.  The first time I went, I was in a bit of a hurry and got the S4 - Burmese style mixed salad and loved it so much I had to go back with my wife and our friends (I have friends???).  My only regret is that we never ate in.  Here is the line up:  While waiting for our take out order to be made, we got the A4 - Green tea leaf salad which is made with fermented tea leaves and served with tea. Get this, it is just so delicious. It's crispy, salty, spicy and has the most pleasant aroma.  To go: S4 Burmese style mixed salad N3 Noodle with chicken, fresh veg and coconut  N4 Shan style noodles with chicken E3 Burmese style beef curry  So here's the kicker - each dish is served with a soup and Ommaar, the owner goes into detail about what soup to have with what dish. LISTEN TO HER, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!  The food alone is amazing. The food with the paired soup brings about a brand new flavour. Don't believe me? Try the beef curry alone and then with the soup.   My wife and friends loved the food as well. We are absolutely going back.   We have yet to try the deserts."}
