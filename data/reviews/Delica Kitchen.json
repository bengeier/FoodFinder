{"text":"Oh Delica, how I love you so.  You are my 'having a bad day', 'having a great day', 'i deserve a special lunch because I did so well on ....', 'I deserve Delica today because that meeting was just truly awful.....\".....you get the picture, I use whatever excuse I can to justify buying lunch at Delica, and its turned into a very regular habit. 
Everything I've ever had from Delica I've absolutely loved!  
The Classic sandwich is delicious, but seems to be a summer menu item (oh how I will miss it), recent try of the pulled turkey sandwich was delish, the grilled cheese with apple is also super yum, I love the tuscan tomato soup, I really loved a salad this summer with fresh Ontario corn, tomatoes, seasoning, and all sorts of other deliciousness in with I think bulger, a green bean tomato salad was also a great item this summer, the mini espresso chocolate dessert things are awesome.  And I've also recently discovered their lattes are very very good, and very well priced (cheaper then Starbucks).  
So overall you can sense the love, and if you haven't tried this place yet I strongly recommend giving it a try. 
I also really like seeing that the owner is very involved and frequently is seen working behind the counter."}
{"text":"Great spot for a delicious treat or afternoon lunch. Lots of seating and the perfect place to catch up with friends. The tea selection is amazing- I think they get them from David's Tea, I've tried cinnamon plum and toasty almond, both are super tasty. I'll be back again! 
But don't expect to get any work done here if you bring your laptop- no wifi or outlets."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The Yelp profile says that it is bad for kids, but I really don't see that. Sure, there are some, ahem, items that are more of an acquired taste, but it has amazing, kid -friendly treats, too. But that's not to say that an adult can't enjoy a good donut, even a sour cream and granola flavored one,(delicious). Most importantly of all, when you go there, ORDER THE OREOS,I MEAN EIGHTEEN OF THEM!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect for grabbing a quick bite and enjoying a seat at a place that could match the likeness of any dainty little french cafe. They have a good selection of sandwiches and pastries (I am a fan of their Banana Bread) all of which aren't exuberantly decorated with ingredients. (No extreme sandwiching here folks)

Simple, quality ingredients that are healthy and taste fresh but unfortunately come at a high price, which hurt this poor little girl's wallet. Sure what I ate was very delicious but for a sandwich and a small pastry it costed me close to 20 dollars!

I'll come here only to indulge in a treat or two or  to reward myself for attempting to exercise but that's it because I've got a bike to save for! Yay for being city!"}
{"text":"Dear lord this place will rob me of my pay cheques...

$10.00 + may be pretty hefty for your daily lunch but this place is my weekday treat.
The ingredients are wholesome and deliciously paired.
The rotating menu that reflects seasonal changes keeps me coming back.

Most of all Delica's sweet treats are the shiny star especially freshly delivered Paulette's Dougnut. (except Mondays) You really have to try one.

While I wouldn't recommend this place as your daily lunchtime jaunt,unless you want a gaping hole left in your wallet.

This place is damn near perfect for a lunchtime treat."}
{"text":"The spicy hot chocolate is not spicy and not hot.  It comes with an optional marshmallow, but the beverage is so lukewarm that the marshmallow never melts, and it literally has zero kick. I once asked them to give me another spicy hot chocolate, thinking they had mistakenly given me the classic, but the replacement was just as insipid.

Having said that, the chopped salad is excellent, with crisp hearty greens and a variety of healthy proteins. The detox soup is not bad, if a bit bland. The sandwiches look yummy, but I haven't tried them since I try to avoid carbs."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, healthy food, and amazing taste.

This is a great place for lunch - wonderful soups, sandwiches, and tasty desserts.  The chefs here are inventive in their use of healthy fresh ingredients and they can make some very very tasty combinations.

The only issue I have with this place is the price.  It is a little pricey and kinda addictive.  So its difficult to go in here without spending 15 bucks on lunch.  If it was a little more affordable, this would be my everyday hang for lunch."}
{"text":"I recall Delica's opening. Prices were highesh compared to all others in the hood.
So this brings me to today. The price of a soup (large chicken) and a tiny sandwich was over $18. At least surprise me at that price. Their quality is atrocious and the sandwich (roast beef) was inedible. 
Sorry but this lunch was so disappointing and expensive that it is my last visit. Sad."}
{"text":"love it!My faves include the gazpacho soup,triple prime sandwhich,salmon sandwich ,almond date cookies or the mini espresso bites.The berry roobios tea is great as welll.I do agree that it's a bit pricey as a result i cannot affor it as often as i would like to.But great job,food is consistently good and that's important."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch based on the good reviews. I ordered the Detox salad and the tomato soup. The soup was fantastic -- tasted home made. It was thick and chunky, like tomtato puree style with a blend of spices. The salad was also quite good with all fresh ingredients. I really enjoyed my meal here and look forward to coming again. A large salad and small soup set me back $12. There was not much seating available, so it's a good place for take out. I saw they have a selection of desserts as well that all looked quite tasty."}
{"text":"Financial abduction is common when lunching out.  Delica is made from scratch, tlc, all natural, there's love in this stuff, goodness. Hence you have to pay a little more and the daily line up proves it's worth it to most.  Tasty, fresh, delicious.  Did not win me over on their supposed bestseller donut though.  

Clean and charming, the staff is very helpful in adjusting your order for dietary needs. Great gluten free bun. The Asian Slaw is scrumptious, the popcorn is an unexpected sweet/hot combo that makes for tasty snacking, and the Heart of Darkness Chili is out of this world. Forget around the campfire chili, this is grown up, all short rib meat and rich broth. 

Pricey yes, if you are thrifty you'll still be spending $15 but worth the splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"Use to eat the amazing pulled turkey sandwiches from here, but stopped because I feel like they are probably 1000 calories, but super yummy!  I've since switched to picking up the occasional soup or salad.  Always fresh and delicious.  It is pricey, so I consider it a treat when I do pop in."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down and have a bite to eat. Large food selection and offer many tea flavours. The toasty almond and cinnamon plum are amazing! Wifi connection didn't work here and have no electrical outlets- not a good place to work. But a great place to sit down and catch up with a friend"}
{"text":"Everything in there is delicious, fresh and made with high quality ingredients.
I've tried several sandwiches like the Parisienne and the smoked salmon, both outstanding. 
The soups don't taste like they threw rotten veggies into tetrapak stock - they are creamy, chunky, tasty, hmmm...
Highly recommended. Some find it too pricey, but you do get what you pay for, and the freshness and quality of Delica justifies the higher price tag."}
{"text":"Pricey, but worth it if you want something a little more inspired for lunch. The Asian chicken slaw ($9.50) is wonderful and is my go-to lunchtime salad in the neighborhood. They have great baked goods and their coffee is pretty tolerable in a neighborhood where \"gourmet\" coffee is represented by Starbucks, Illy, and other bottom of the barrel brands."}
{"text":"The food is so good. SO good. I love their salads and sandwiches and jammies. I just can't support this business anymore because the people who work there are miserable. The Leslieville location is fine - the staff are lovely there. It's the Yonge and St. Clair location that makes me queasy to go into. They look at you sideways, forget your order, rush you, etc. I have never met such a strange group of servers! They are all weird. I have yet to meet one nice one. What a shame."}
{"text":"The food is mighty tasty but man oh man, those prices... I suppose it's fitting for the neighbourhood but I still cringe whenever I have to shell out $10 for a sandwich. 

Aside from the prices, I don't have many bad things to say about the place. Charming atmosphere, friendly staff and absolutely delectable food! Next time I'll definitely try out one of those magical looking donuts!"}
{"text":"Came here to get take-out and was blown away at their prices! Truly overpriced for a small, cold sandwich. I did, however, enjoy their tomato soup! Perfect for a cold day.

This place is located just south of Yonge and st Clair. Limited seats, no outlets, but cute cafe atmosphere and polite employees."}
{"text":"Welcome to Yonge and St. Clair!!

Having worked at this corner for a few months now, I was starting to worry about limited lunch choices and am happy Delica Kitchen has joined the fray.

The prices are a bit steep, so I probably will not be picking up a $9 Parisienne sandwich more than once in a while. But for that $9 I am getting a gustatory delight! The bread is crusty and warm, the ham is thick and smoky, the cheese is ripe, and the toppings of pear and pickle go well with the Dijon mustard. It's a damn good sandwich.

The menu is pretty extensive, with lots of sammies, salads, soups and sides, so lots of choices will be vying for my lunchtime pleasure. The owner is the daughter of the founders of Ace Bakery, so rest assured there will always be good bread.

Delica opens at 7:30am and serves coffees, eggs and baked goods. I am ready to check out their strawberry jammies donut concoctions ($2.50). Everything is made fresh at Delica and I'm sure they are organic when possible, etc etc. Toronto foodie buzzwords etc etc.

This is mostly a take-out place, with a long counter covering half the space. Towards the back across from the cash are some chairs at a little counter against the wall. 

The place is clean and sparsely decorated, with lots of white and black posters on the walls with pithy sayings like, \"If you have to choose between butter and margarine, trust the cow before the chemist\". If not an original sentiment, it is cleverly presented.

I say again, Delica, welcome to the neighborhood. I am sure we will be friends. Maybe not best friends because you're pricy, but friends nonetheless."}
{"text":"Nice place for delicious sandwiches, but man are prices steep. $10 for a sandwich? It better be worth it at that cost...but all in all, it was. I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich, which had grilled peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and a lemon cream cheese. It was full of flavour, and it tasted very fresh. My boyfriend ordered the pulled turkey sandwich, which he said was very good. Our sandwiches were surprisingly filling, so there was no need to purchase anything extra. They serve soups and salads in addition to their sandwiches.

Next time I might go back to try one of their baked goods, which looked enticing as well."}
{"text":"Great little cafe in midtown. Cute decor, yummy food and friendly staff. I had an almond butter & dark chocolate cookie with a coffee. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh and made with quality ingredients. Yes prices are on the high side, but on par with the Forest Hill area."}
{"text":"This is an over-priced sandwich shop in tony St Clair area. I am not complaining about the quality, just stating a fact about the prices!

Thank goodness for the free of charge spa water they serve!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out after living in the area and walking past it for years. I'm glad I did cause now I have a new lunch place! 

I grabbed their seasonal vegetarian sandwich to go with a Delica Kitchen Oreo and a coconut macaroon. The sandwich and the Oreo were great but the macaroon was too dry for my liking (probably because it's gluten-free). I especially loved the chickpea spread on the sandwich - any good vegetarian sandwich should have chickpeas! I saw that they also have a good selection of soups (vegetarian/vegan friendly) but I went too early and they weren't ready yet, will have to try them next time.

Prices are a little high (as other reviewers have mentioned) but not unusually so, considering the area."}
{"text":"A nice little sandwich joint. The selection is great, the staff are friendly, and the food is prepped quickly. I had the pulled turkey sandwich. Very tasty, though a bit on the expensive side for what you get. The bread was particularly nice."}
{"text":"Super popular among the office workers in the area.
1. They have the best sandwiches! The pulled turkey sandwich is my favourite and I see lots of people ordering the spicy bird sandwich too. 
2. They also have great soups, like the Detox chicken & veggie soup. It comes in XL size only but it's very light and easy to finish, at least most of it.
3. They have baked goods like cookies, muffins, jammies and they bring Paulette's doughnuts. I like the jammies and the almond-chocolate cookie. 
4. Good filling salads like the Delica Chopped Salad.

Everything is very fresh and they use good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Good soup and sandwiches, though if you get too attached it will turn into an extremely expensive habit. $16 for soup, sandwich, and water, ouch!"}
{"text":"Cute little European-style sandwich, salad, soup place.  I had the \"Chef's Creation\" sandwich ($9) which rotates weekly and this time was roasted lamb, zucchini, and roasted garlic white bean spread on a panini type bread.  The bread was toasted before the sandwich was served to me, which was very nice.  The lamb was a little chewy though.  I also had a homemade whoopee pie ($2.50) which was lovely and could have satisfied my sweet tooth for the day.

The place is small and there was limited seating on this sunny Saturday afternoon.  The food is good but don't go here if you're feeling terribly hungry, unless you want to spend $20 on lunch, and even then I don't think I'd be very full.  I would definitely go back here to treat myself, but next time I will add a soup or side salad so that I feel like I had something more substantial (but still get dessert of course).  Their sandwich options are listed on their website and are worth a read.

I also took home a \"Best Banana Bread\" ($2.50) which has dark chocolate and bran, and is pairing perfectly with my afternoon coffee as I write this."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed Euro-food-snob, (translation: I have European sensibilities, and I am pretentious about good food) Delica Kitchen deserves my four stars. Everything is made fresh and with a dash of sophistication. The ambiance is a simple treat. If you're looking for a quick escape at lunch, or a treat with a friend, this is a great little spot in mid-town Toronto. My favourites are their almond-butter cookie or the home made oreo cookie accompanied by a well-made latte. The staff are lovely as well, so say hello to Devon, Andy or Maria when you're there! Tell them that Gloria recommended you :)"}
{"text":"For anyone that likes \"real food\" not processed - this is a fantastic little take out spot at Yonge & St Clair. Not the cheapest ($10-15 for lunch) but fresh meats & poultry, homemade (from scratch) soups, stews, and condiments = fantastic food experience! 

Over the course of the winter months I became addicted to their Heart of Darkness Chili - medium spice broth with large chunks of beef (not ground meat) and beans - makes it bit more stew like that traditional chili - but flavours are deep and rich.  Optional to add sour cream and shredded cheese. Try it with a mini corn bread! Delish! 

Their sandwiches come on \"melt in your mouth fresh\" breads, buns and baquettes which are toasted on demand. Does take a few minutes to get your order and often there is a line - but I promise its worth it.

NEW this visit they offered a gluten free (GF) bun that is probably the best GF bread product I have ever tasted.  5 out of 5 for taste and consistency (anyone that eats GF knows the nightmares involved with bread products). Even if I wasnt GF I would probably order this bun - its that good!

Ok enough about the bread - what was on it?  Medium rare roast beef, provalone cheese, marinated portobello mushrooms (very meaty and delish!), and  aioli.  You should also try the pulled turkey sandwich and Parisian (black forest ham and brie). 

Not somewhere to go everyday due to cost, but a definite \"treat yourself\" place on those long work days where you just need something amazing to pick up your day."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a european type of style.
I keep walking by this place and in my mind say \"next time.. \" 

Well Next time happened today! 

I really enjoyed the food in here - I know it's fresh and unique however I find it really pricey.  There is something wrong when you pay $12 for a sandwich. 
I ended up with the Tuna Melt.
\"Mayo-less white flaked tuna tossed in lemon, olive oil, and fresh rosemary, over-cured tomatoes and asiago cheese on ACE ciabatta piccola\" - SO GOOD!

I also got the banana bread with chocolate chips which I wasn't a fan of.  I noticed the bran taste right away and then read what was in it and there ya go - BRAN.
Don't try and make it healthy :P 

I would definetely go back here but it would have to be a 'treat' - I couldn't afford this place all the time although the food is great."}
{"text":"One of the highest of quality food places I have been to in a while. There is so much good to say about this place.

Let me start from the beginning...

I was introduced to Delica by a friend who graciously gave me a couple of bags of their teas that had been packaged for the holidays. I received them as a gift. I love their toasty almond tea, their berry green tea, which I also received was enjoyable; however, I prefer green tea that I could put milk into and that one wasn't it for me.

I walked in one day, a few months following that tea trial and I sampled some of their mushroom soup. This soup is something I still have not gone back for, but something I will be trying more of, possibly, even tomorrow because I love it THAT much (to go to Delica two days in a row). It taste like pizza in a soup. And I love mushrooms. SERIOUSLY it is amaZing! 

Their smoked salmon sandwich I tried today and it is delicious. Like incredible. It has some goat cheese on it, with some capers on a whole wheat style bread from ACE bakery. It is extremely well-balanced. Drool, just thinking about it comes out of my mouth. This one is a definite must try for anyone, as they really pack that sandwich full of smoked salmon, which does not come cheap.

I also always seem to get a sample of the tomato soup when I walk in, it is another secret favourite of mine and would pair nicely with a grilled cheese, if one decides to take it home. 

I have yet to try some of their other sandwiches, like their grilled veg and I think they also have one on gluten free bread that I would like to try. I look forward to when I do, because so far, SO GOOD. Honestly the name really lives up to the food there, everything is delectable! 

Umm, hmmm, today I also ended up getting their plum cinnamon, earl grey tea, when put with almond milk, it tended to separate, and this made it off putting; but, it would have been otherwise delicious with soy, or regular milk. My mistake cost me that enjoyment.

Moving on to their baked goods now: I love their jammies. On numerous occasions I have had them. They are like an open doughnut, with a gooey centre, all jammed up with their homemade strawberry jam....very tasty. Their almond butter and chocolate cookie is good, but personally I would love more almond butter flavour, as I am an almond butter fanatic. I've also tried their oatmeal cookie, which again is another good thing. But I would like to see an oatmeal and CHOCOLATE cookie, as nothing is greater than chocolate.

I've actually had quite a bit of food here, their popcorn - a chili and honey flavoured is rich in butter, but damn, is it flavourful. 

The sweet potato and jalopeno soup is MMMM. I have some that I picked up today sitting in my fridge for me, for tomorrow and I am excited!!!! 

That is pretty much it. The cornbread is sweet but again, incredibly tasty. Anything that comes out of Delica Kitchen is worth the money. Hands down."}
{"text":"Delicious! So glad this place is still here AND that they are now serving gluten free sandwiches. Love that they mix it up every day offering great specials and the range of options available. Between the soups, salads, pastries,  sandwiches and sides there is something for everyone. 

My only complaint is that I wish they had more gluten free sandwiches available! They are often sold out of the meat option when I arrive and unfortunately the vegetarian is not always lactose free (or the server is unsure, which is I suppose a second problem!). 

Such a great spot and for those of you who can eat gluten you are more than spoiled for options!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long walk through the Moore Park ravine, and the Aye Caramba sandwich -- flank steak with tomatillo and corn salsa in fresh bread -- was just what the doctor ordered. While the portions aren't huge (especially given the somewhat high prices) the food seems artfully prepared with high quality ingredients. Oh, and did I mention delicious? My companion had a small bowl of chili which was also very appetizing and featured chunks of steak rather than ground beef.

If you're near St. Clair and Yonge, this is definitely a nice place to pick up lunch to go. (They have a few seats, including a couple stools on the street, but mostly it's just a counter.) They also have a few take-out dinner options and they do catering."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Where do I even start?! 

VIBE 
I love the clean, white interior. It's like Martha Stewart's interior savvy niece decorated in here. You've got the tiled floors, silver stainless steel displays for the food, silver stools and cute little white trays as table tops in the front and L-shaped wooden bar space in the back. It's not a huge space but they make the most of it. On the walls are quotes in black and white. They can be inspiring or pretentious, whichever way you look at it. Otherwise, very welcoming! It feels a bit Parisian.

I ATE 
I had The Carnivore Creation, which is the cafe's weekly special sandwich. This one had prosciutto, carrot slaw, apple and asiago cheese on Ace baguette (did you know the owner is the daughter of the Ace Bakery founder)? Honestly, I haven't a had a sandwich this good in a really long time. The flavours were sweet and salty and the crunch of the sandwich was spot on. 

I had previously had the Flourless Chocolate-Espresso Mini Bites and well, let's just say you can't just have one. They're addictive! This time, for dessert, I opted for Delica's version of the Oreo cookie and guess what? new addiction! I got two. I thought they would be a bit softer for some reason but they tasted pretty spot on to the original. I like a new twist on an old classic. 

I'll definitely be back. But why the missing half star? It's pricey. Like $10 for a sandwich and nothing else pricey. I was lucky to get a gift certificate here but this is a bit steep for lunch (with a drink, everything came out to $14). 

Update: on my second visit, I had the tomato basil soup and their bacon grilled cheese sandwich. To drink: Snapple. I love that they sell snapple here. A solid choice for a rainy day. Still love this place. Yum! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Delica is Delica-licious. My challenge: have a one day sandwich sale or combo deal (with a dessert) for under $10 and I'll bet you, you'll have a line up out the door. If I hear about it, I'll be there (and tell all my friends!)."}
{"text":"sometimes i wonder what makes a jambon-beurre from france so good. it's just ham, butter and bread, no? 

the thing is, it's the best ham, the best butter and the best bread you can get. that's what makes it exceptional.

i get the same feeling from delica. it's more pricey than some places, but the ingredients are exceptional and everything is perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"I went to Delica kitchen for a meeting downtown. Great little spot and while it was empty when I arrived, there was a fair amount of traffic that picked up take-out. I ordered a ginger cookie (gfree) which was soft and delicious. On my way out I grabbed a Tuscan tomato soup and a roast beef sandwich to go. Both travelled well and were incredibly delicious. I've never had a gfree bun that tasted so great and wasn't heavy and thick. Their gfree food is not made at this location but is made in a certified gfree kitchen and wrapped before being sent over. No chance of cross contamination. My only qualm was the prices. I think I spent close to $15 on those three items. I understand its a much higher quality of food, natural ingredients, etc, but I think they could stand to lower their prices a bit and still make a hefty profit. 
I've also heard the doughnuts are pretty amazing - they looked so good I was sorely tempted to suffer the pain of eating one, but managed to knock some sense into myself. My colleague had one and said it was \"life-changing\", so I'd recommend those as well."}
{"text":"Great tasting, gourmet food done with flavour and style in mind. It is certainly at the higher end of the lunch budget range but great for an occasional treat. Their Spicy Bird sandwich and gazpacho soup are my favourite. They also have great pastries, including homemade doughnuts. My only criticism is that they serve their soups in disposable paper bowls with plastic spoons. I don't even like it for picnics, so certainly not at a restaurant charging $20 for lunch."}
{"text":"This restaurant is owned by the icy and beautiful heiress of the Ace Bakery dynasty.... hmm I wonder how she got the money to start her business so young?

Everything here tastes great (and is priced accordingly), however I doubt the quality of the ingredients. I saw a huge branded food truck pull up beside them and bring them no frills level mass production food- they definitely don't use food fresh from the organic food market. In addition, they ripped off David Tea's \"Forever Nuts\" tea and called it \"Delica's tea\" and said it was made from scratch! Perhaps it was, but not by them. For anyone that's had it, they know how unmistakeable its colour (red) and taste is. 

The staff are really great and helpful but the way that the manager openly speaks to them makes me think that they aren't paid or treated too well. 

They have healthy options which is a plus. They are also pretty quick to serve. It's also a beautiful space, one that the owner's wealthy family clearly spared no expense on."}
{"text":"Had a very lovely lunch at Delica Kitchen. The place specializes in quick, healthy lunch fares, offering an assortment of sandwiches, salads, soups and baked goods. The place is tiny, but has a friendly and warm vibe. 
I tried the Parisienne, with smoked ham, Gruyere cheese, Bosc Pear, roasted garlic aioli, and Dijon mustard on White Flute. It was delicious! I particularly loved the tang of the mustard against the meat and cheese. I also sampled a soup and the chili, both of which are fresh and excellent. However, the strawberry jammie was a bit of a disappointment because it wasn't hot when I had it. The consistency of it resembled a muffin more than a doughnut. But all in all, a really lovely place for lunch."}
{"text":"I met up with an out-of-town friend here for coffee and tea the other day. This place is really cute!! It was dinner time and we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant when we came in, which is a great thing because this place has VERY few seats. The mounted metal trays and stools along the wall are fun and they've been kind enough to provide individual jacket hooks beside each stool. 

I ordered a cup of toasty almond tea and a muffin... came up to almost $7! I hadn't read the reviews here beforehand otherwise maybe I wouldn't have been so surprised. I could only think \"This better be a pretty damn good muffin and tea\". Happily, it WAS a fantastic muffin. I was less impressed with the tea, which I expected to be more earthy since it's called toasty almond, but found it was more of a fruity tea with nuts added * not a fan of fruity tea *

Anyway, this is very much a cute spot to chill, we enjoyed our time but just be aware of the small seating area and the cost!"}
