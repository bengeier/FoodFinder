{"text":"The place itself is extremely aesthetically nice and just a great place to hang out. They have games for you to play too. The portions are very small which is the only downside for me. Service was okay but the desserts were actually really good taste wise. Very authentic Hong Kong dessert. I would come back!  P.S. A few things (an entire page) on their menu is not available."}
{"text":"Went with my baby and had a really good time with my friend who also have a baby too. I think because of the previous comments about their staff make them start to improve their communication with the customers. I got very friendly people and I was served very good. It is a new place and I believe their customer service will get better and better.  Food might be a little bit pricy but taste good, especially it is NOT crazy sweet. I love the New Orleans Style chicken wings. The crystal dome platter have a very pretty presentation.  Well, as a new store, I know there is space for them to improve and I can feel they are trying to get more experience and make things better. I will definitely go again :)"}
{"text":"Lovely environment and presentation, however, service was so so. I didn't like how my cold Mango Sago with Pomelo dessert came super fast while my friend's warm Glutinous Rice Balls with Crushed Peanuts took forever. I waited a few minutes before eating and still finished before the Rice Balls came. And apparently, even with a sweet tooth, it was a bit too sweet too. Also, not all the items on the menu were available and we couldn't help not noticing a few typos. There's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, I order the mango with coding milk dessert, mango was sour but  everything else was good. Try it out if you're a durian lover"}
{"text":"I read all the negative reviews on this place but Blogto really sold it for me... that crystal ball was Instagram worthy lol. Anyhow came with a few friends, took forever for someone to greet us at the door. That was already a sign for poor service to come. Once we did sit at a table, we noticed lots of items on the menu were crossed off or simply unavailable. After sitting for quite some time, we were having a difficult time getting any server's attention. We gave up and thought someone would eventually come up to at least give us water. The answer was nope. So we got up, left the restaurant.. and I doubt anyone even knew."}
{"text":"Bad, tatse nothing like hong kong style dessert  Portion is very little.  Service is fine. The dessert does not taste good at all."}
{"text":"I went around 930pm on Tuesday, plenty seats. I have to say the portion was so small~ like half of the other competitors, and the taste was ordinary. I will not go again."}
{"text":"New dessert chain from hk! Read about it on blogto recently & was surprised to stumble across the restaurant when i was having dinner at the same plaza! Very clean, nice , modern with fake greens/plants around. Washroom was clean with qtips, floss & even hair-tie for the the ladies! Service was excellent - our soda drink was flat & they quickly made us a new one. Dessert overall was just average. Appearance wise for sure wins but nothing outstanding. Would definitely check it out before the hype though!"}
{"text":"Portions were small compared to price. Giving 3stars as it tasted good. Not great but good. Nice modern decor"}
{"text":"In a plaza north of Finch and Midland already saturated with food options,  Hong Kong's Smile Dessert has finally opened in Toronto. I had actually never heard of Smile Dessert before a few days ago, but after seeing some of the spectacular looking dessert creations on Instagram, I had to check this place out. This cafe is a beautiful space with large windows, tables and bench seating on one side, as well as a few larger booths that could probably accommodate up to 10 people.   I stopped by on the first day of their soft opening. There must have been at least a dozen staff standing around at first, then rushing around to attend to customers. I was seated immediately. I enjoyed sitting near the kitchen to see some of the staff at work plating and preparing some of the beautiful creations. The staff were helpful and attentive. Appropriately for a soft opening, they seemed genuinely interested in hearing customer feedback.  I ordered the Oreo chocolate mousse (although in the menu the title is much more complicated than that). The cake was beautiful but slightly different than expected from the photo. Truthfully it was a bit phallic in presentation. The chocolate ganache was smooth and not sweet with a nice contrast of texture from bits of nuts and cookie crumbs. Clearly they keep the cake in the freezer, as the middle of my dessert was still frozen, which unfortunately did not allow the full chocolate flavour to shine through because of the colder temperature it was served at.   I also ordered the Mango Sago Mixed. It has a fun presentation with caviar-like tapioca, pomelo, and cubes of sweet Australian mango served on large spoons encircling a stemless glass of mango pur√©e with a small amount of all of these toppings mixed in. This presentation helped to elevate this relatively simple dessert. However at $8.49, less pricey options would to get the mango sago with pomelo, or mango sago mixed with grass jelly (each $6.99).   They serve several hot food options, including popcorn chicken, seafood with cream sauce, and other offerings familiar to Taiwanese and Hong Kong styles of cuisine.  Dining alone, I did not indulge in any of the molecular gastronomy type desserts, like the beautiful sugar orb or flaming black sesame sponge cake or cute tiramisu pot. But I look forward to coming back with hubby, family and friends to try more of the cafe's offerings."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the interior design of the store but I'm quite upset with how they are opened not long ago but so many things in their menu are not available.   The red bean soup was so not well done at all the liquid parts from the red bean if you let it sit for 10 seconds. With such a huge bowl they only had 3 dumplings in... doesn't cost a lot to give a customer 5.   The milk pudding with red bean... I wish u can choose hot or cold.. only served cold...."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend night around 9.30pm and there were still plenty of tables left and got a table for 5 right away. The decor is nice, feels modern, spacious with high ceilings.   My friends and I saw the cute sugar orb that was going around social media and we wanted to try it but it was $30! Which is way too overpriced! So we decided not to get it and try other things instead. I got the coconut, mango chai seed slush. It was pretty to look at but the taste was bland. No mango or coconut flavor, and there was just too many chia seeds, I mean I love chia seeds but theirs had a grassy note to them which made it slightly unpleasant. It was not good and not worth almost $8.   My friend got the mango sticky rice, again he said it was flavorless and it was more ice than anything else and the portion was quite small. Our other friends were also not impressed with their orders including the mango crepe cake, and mango sago.   We did sit there for a few hours and no one kicked us out which was nice, so its a good place to catch up but seriously...just go somewhere else and don't believe the hype =("}
{"text":"Horrible service. Hot food is not hot. One plate of our table is 30 minutes late, and the explanation is that they \"optimize their serving process by aggregating the orders\""}
{"text":"Came here for the crystal dome platter and it's sold out.  Opted for the Flaming dark sesame sponge cake instead. The cake looks exactly like a charcoal inside out.  It's dense, heavy, and bland.  Popcorn chicken is juicy.  Black pearl supreme is good but small portion.  Prices are a bit steep.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"WORST chinese dessert place in town.  Very DISAPPOINTING.   Came here and ordered take out on a Saturday.  We ordered two items, the Glutinous rice balls with walnut paste($6.99) and Coconut and Grass Jelly ($5.99).    Glutinous rice balls with walnust paste - the walnust paste tasted so bland, tasted nothing like walnut.  It had very similar flavour as the ones from the instant walnut powder.  The paste was not smooth at all, it had weird residue(not walnut texture-like) in it which was not pleasant at all. The rice balls has sesame paste inside, nothing too spectacular.    Coconut and Grass Jelly - its basically grass jelly and young coconut meat in coconut milk.  The grass jelly were alright.  But the coconut meat were still frozen ! Some of them were hard as rocks and there were ice chucks in the coconut milk.  Its pretty obvious that they did not have enough time to defrost the coconut meat before serving them to the customers.  Every bite was crunchy from the ice chunks...  Also, the portions were so small considering the price we paid !   Definitely would not come back!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday night, it wasn't too busy, we got a table right away when we walked in. Servers are nice and smiley. There are a good amount of choices on the menu, unfortunately they sold out of mochi balls, and many items come with it, hence, that limited our choices on that night. Portions are fairly small if I compare it to Sugar Marmalade (pricing is almost the same). I like how the desserts were not too sweet. It's convenient that they take credit cards. Will come back but for a little while."}
{"text":"I was here with my girl friend last couple of weeks ago. I'd have to say this place is not worth your time if you want real desserts. If you're looking to satisfy your camera and wanted something more picture worthy and don't care much about the taste of the food and price then this is the place for you! They spend a lot of creativity and time on plating but not so much with their culinary skills...or they're maybe just cheaping out.  Location: This place is located at the Sky City Plaza. Pretty much the whole strip of the plaza are food restaurants. There's lot of parking spaces available so no worry for not finding one.  Environment: The restaurant is well lit with interesting geometric fruits decor on the wall. They allowed Tabletop games but you'll need to provide your own.   Food: We ordered a Durian mochi (they should really add \"bite sized\" on the menu) and mango pancake.   Let's just say the durian Mochi is nothing special. The smell is there and the taste..it's very subtle. Because it's only a bite sized mochi, you don't get much durian out of it. I shouldn't be fooled by the price I guess.   Next is mango pancake..plating was really nice. The pancakes comes in two pieces on a stone textured plate. What I find inside the pancake was lots of cream and very little mango meat inside. They should really rename their menu and write \"CREAM pancakes\" rather than mango pancake when there's hardly any.   Overall: Food are way over priced for the quality that we're getting. Nice menu with selections of interesting desserts and well illustrated but deceiving food pictures. I didn't order drinks so I'm not sure how they taste but after this experience I most likely not come back again!"}
{"text":"3.5 I was quite impressed by the Smile, but I do find their portions run small compared to their competitors in the same area. The place looks modern and comfy with wooden decor and greenery accents. They also have these cool geometric fruit diagrams as part of their branding throughout the store. Their menu is really pretty with some novelty options for Chinese desserts. It's disappointing that many of the more hype items are blocked off but the remaining variety is still plentiful. Their soup desserts were about half the size of usual dessert places, but pricing was similar.  I got their mango \"double milk\" pudding, it was not the double layer...but the mango was sweet and worked well with the pudding. My sister got the mango crepe, it was beautifully plated and I liked how the filling was mango chunks in a mango mousse and not just simple whipping cream. I appreciate the innovative touches and would love to try more items. They are slightly pricier for the portions but worth it if you are looking to try some new spins."}
{"text":"sighhhhhhh I really wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't that great.  I am a huge chinese dessert fan, so as soon as i saw the unique dessert offerings and traditional sweets they had, I went ASAP.  The desserts were not terrible, but they did fall short.  The crystal Mango Roll was legit mango cubes wrapped in some fancy jelly like skin.. um 4 small pieces for $7.  We also got the mango mochi supreme, which was alright, but 3 pieces at $5 is laughable, especially since they were the size of a toonie... The Sesame and Walnut soup was also dissapointing. The dessert came looking like a yin yang(which was cute). The sesame soup was bland AF.. i swear packet ones taste better. HOWEVER, the walnut soup was great to our surprise.   overall, I'm so dissapointed I understand that y'all have to make profit, but like.... can i get like 5 mochi's at least.  The taste isn't anything superior either, which makes me think that I most likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I really have some expectation for this place after knowing this dessert place is from Hong Kong.  So my friend, hubby and I wanna give it a try on the 2nd day of its soft opening.  Sorry that I must say it's really bad.  All of us ordered traditional Chinese dessert to give it a test-Black sesame walnut sweet soup with dumplings, walnut almond sweet soup & black sesame red bean sweet soup.  Here's our comments:  -hot dessert should be hot not room temp -black sesame doesn't has its aroma, bitter in taste -red bean soup and almond soup were watery.  Almond soup same as black sesame doesn't has almond taste at all.  Even the instant almond drink I have daily taste a lot better. -Dumpling seems like undercooked, hard inside. -no water being served (actually included us, there were only 3 tables, so no excuse being busy)  According to my hubby, he saw some desserts were reheat by microwave.    The only thing we like it's the decor.....  One of the waitress asked us for comment and we did tell her the truth.  She told us another customer also complained the dessert not hot.  We received a $10 cash coupon valid till Feb 12, but do u think I will go again??"}
{"text":"Came here for late night dessert and was surprised by their overpriced dessert and significantly small portion compare to other dessert places. I was actually a bit excited to see new Hong Kong style dessert place to open in Scarborough and didn't expect to have such disappointing experience.  Even though we have seen bad reviews at this place, we still decided to give it a shot and try out their dessert. However, the quality of their food is really below average nothing surprising at all. Not just their portion was super small comparing to the price, but also the overall quality wasn't good. At least not good enough for me to recommend people to try or going again myself."}
{"text":"Came after dinner. Service was really bad. Took them 20mins just to take our order! The portion is very small. Nothing really special."}
{"text":"This is 2.5 stars.   The good: The place is nice and spacious and they have a wide and interesting selection of dessert. I ordered the half almond and half walnut sweet soup. It was good but not amazing.   The bad: Why does the dessert soup come lukewarm? Like it was merely a few minutes before I ate it and it felt like I left it there for a good 20 minutes. The portion size is also quite small for what you pay for. At 6.99...I'm not sure if it was worth it.   Yes for the pictures and adventure. No for the value."}
{"text":"What really stood out on the menu was the multitude of spelling errors.   Creap instead of crepe Kumpuat instead of kumquat Glitinous instead of glutinous Re \"?\" instead of red Oloong instead of oolong Soga instead soda Pitaya instead of dragon fruit?  Not to mention, there are many spacing and formatting errors. Certainly, it's a grammar purist's nightmare. I think a bit of revision would have helped before committing to printing it.  As for the food, most of their menu is mango-dependent, which does not bode well for cooler months when mangoes are not naturally in season. It is not recommended to order their mango items until the summer or else it will be sour.   I had the steamed milk with red bean. It's nothing special; pretty ho-hum as far as steamed milk desserts go. Their prices are also a bit on the high end, especially with many more affordable options for desserts around the plaza."}
{"text":"2.5 Star with rooms for improvement  Since it is their first week in business, I can understand there are a lot of confusion both in the front and kitchen. Hopefully they would have that sorted out in the future.  A better system of who and how to greet and seat your customers.  - I came in on a Saturday when the restaurant was half full, I was standing in the entry trying to get someone attention but I felt like all the staff just stayed at the back area and tried not to have any eye contact with me  - I do understand Midland and Finch has a high concentration of Mandarin speakers but unfortunately I am not one of them. Please kindly make sure that your customers understand and able to communicate.   - Try to keep an eye on the dining area at all time. It was a frustrating experience trying to get attention from the servers even there were plentiful  Food Quality and Quantity  - Durian Mochi ($4.99) though small in portion but actually really good. It has a nice thin chewy wrapping and filled with durian meat  - Milk Pudding with Red Bean ($5.99) served room temperature warm. Maybe the menu should have said it is served cold or should it be hot? The red beans though is good quality, but for $6 I do expect a little more?  - Mini spoons as utensils might help to make the dessert looks like bigger in portion? I can't imagine if someone has big hands and how they can use those playhouse spoons  Soft opening special 20% off was nice touch but I cannot really justify paying full price here aside from the mochi."}
{"text":"I was drawn to try this cafe by the pretty aesthetics from the photos. It somewhat resembles the decor of Light Cafe and Latera with the abundance of greenery and industrial elements. It also had some interesting menu items such as the crystal dome platter. It is located in the Sky City Plaza amoungst the other growing food chains which are popping up here.   Upon entering the cafe it definitely did not disappoint in the decor and ambiance. It really is a paradise for instagrammers and food photographers. The desserts however were sub-optimal and quite a let down. I ordered the steamed milk with red bean and the coconut milk with sago and grass jelly. The pictures in the menu were very deceiving as the desserts were microscopic! It was so small that I was finished eating in literally a few mouthfuls. Also the coconut sago was lukewarm and had a somewhat of a sore aftertaste. The steamed milk with red beans was not bad but not amazing either. Prices were also on the higher end and you could definitely get better quality elsewhere for the same price if not less.   I would probably not be going back for a return visit however if you are into nice aesthetics and interesting looking desserts such as the crystal ball platter then this place is for you"}
{"text":"Had high expectations coming here after seeing BlogTO's video showing all the different kinds of desserts. Expected to be from a HK chain according to BlogTO but haven't found anything from a chain   Anyways food wise, limited selection as the page filled with gastronomical foods were all unavailable when I went. Ordered the yin yang dessert with gluttonous balls. Wasn't strong and very cornstarchy. Milk pudding with mango wasn't strong in milk. It's better at Double Ming found in the next  plaza.   Overall not planning to come back! Personally I'd go to sugar marmalade or double ming"}
{"text":"This looked like a neat place for dessert when my friends and I walked by on the way to dinner. We decided to try this place instead of going for bingsu.   The decor is funky with the walls that looks like it has foliage growing on it. There seems to be 2 main flavours of desserts, mango and durian.   I know that food that is served doesn't necessarily look like the photos on menus but the mango pancake was very different. What my friend got on the plate looked very much like a crepe cake with thin pieces of mango put in between the layers. She said that there wasn't much flavour except for the mangoes. I'm no chef but maybe the cream could've been infused with mango to bring out the flavour more.   As for the other desserts, my friends said that it was alright, no terrible but not excellent either. The photos on the menu must've been taken up close because the desserts look much bigger than what is actually served.   We came to the consensus that we were not smiling after dining here."}
