{"text":"Had a great brunch here- the menu has  unique offerings (as a 18 year vegan I have a somewhat discriminating palate). Cauliflower and onion \"omelette\" was one of our favorites. The portions were substantial, friendly service and sunny dining room. Have to say that the food was served quickly and the flavors were on point!"}
{"text":"Une cuisine inventive et surtout vegan. Le cadre est globalement assez austère et peu chaleureux ce qui n'est pas du tout le cas du chef propriétaire italien et haut en couleur. C'est une bouffe généreuse tout comme la volubilité du chef. On y vient pour le côté vegan, (très) copieux et bon. Une véritable surprise à l'emplacement d'un ancien restaurant coréen. Chef agréable, sympathique et qui a à cur de combler une clientèle vegan exigeante et mini qui souhaite sortir d'un repas rassasié. Je recommande pour la qualité et la créativité de la cuisine !"}
{"text":"Had the Philly Cheese Steak.  One of the best I've ever had, vegan or not, and I used to live in Philly!  Diner atmosphere with incredible food.  100% recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night (made a reservation but not sure it was necessary). Nice, open space, good service. On that evening, the menu offered portobello and arancini as entrées (both yummy, portobello stuffing slightly too salty), and the duo and trio as main dishes. My favourites were the creamy pasta with artichokes and the risotto. Not sure if these dishes were meant to be shared but the amount of food is huge! We hardly made a dent, and ended up taking 2 boxes home. The food is great though -- tasty and very rich. Would love to return for brunch. My only humble suggestions would be to reduce the food portions (and prices, accordingly), and to use some other material besides styrofoam doggy bags, as it is my understanding that these are not recyclable here in Mtl."}
{"text":"Hey, I am not vegan, let me tell you, you don't have to be one to enjoy this food. It is amazing, highly recommended for food lovers. Low profile restaurant but an extremely high caliber restaurant, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm vegan so it breaks my heart to rate it one star. Full disclosure: I didn't try their brunch, and this review only applies to my dinner experience. Let's start with the good and obvious: you can bring your own wine and they offer big quantities. Seeing the good reviews, we enthusiastically brought omnivore friends to try the vegan food. Each plate, whether it was a side (bread or 'meat' balls), appetizer (salad) or main meal, wasn't presented well on the plate - which you wouldn't expect when you pay about $40-50/person. We started the meal with a salad. The salad was good but big enough to be a meal. The salad was the last thing I enjoyed about the meal. The various pasta meals that followed made me shy to have brought my friends to this place, as none of us seemed to be wowed by the culinary experience. I remember the flavours to be often bland, bitter at moments, and with an aftertaste; I had a hard time to finish my meal and so did my guests. Dessert looked good (chocolate 'Nutella' cake) but was in reality too dense and on the bland side. I'll complete by saying that the service was very slow; we often had to wait 10-15 min to catch the attention of the server. Servers couldn't help us decide on the menu as they had not tasted it. In all, I wouldn't mind trying their brunch one day, but dinner will have to be a no for me."}
{"text":"I'm sad I have to leave Montreal as this is one of the best, if not the best, vegan eateries in Canada. Their croissants would fool any non vegan. So much so that we double checked they're actually vegan and found out they're made by Arhoma La Fabrique on 1700 rue Ontario Est in Montreal. We ordered 6 for next day. The rest of the dishes were amazing and huge. You won't leave hungry that's for sure. My order of waffles and \"bacon\" was fantastic. Waffle was rich and flavourful. Burrito was absolutely huge and made with roti type bread and served open. Side order of sausage was some of the best breakfast sausage, vegan or not, that I've ever had. Potatoes were amazing and came with a great beet dip. We're coming back again before we leave Montreal!"}
{"text":"It pains me write this since I want to support vegan businesses, but this was such a letdown. The food was not of high qualify nor prepared or presented with care. Our soup tasted like doctored up canned soup, the chocolate syrup on the waffles tasted so artificial we were baffled, the side salad was boxed baby spinach with most probably bottled dressing and the price for all of this was as high as the most high end brunch places. We were both surprised for the quality/price ratio and our own disappointment after seeing so many rave reviews."}
{"text":"Adresse testée hier soir. J'avais lu beaucoup d'avis très positifs et je n'ai pas été déçue. Ce restaurant italien et végétalien qui a ouvert début décembre propose des plats savoureux et généreux.  Une cuisine familiale comme on l'aime !"}
{"text":"Their French toast is amazing, 5/5. Their other food is decent. Had the cristini and was more 3/5.   And for the trip home: they have good vegan croissants! :D"}
{"text":"I've been to Vegano's countless times over the past couple of months & I absolutely adore this spot. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly & the restaurant is really quaint! I also love how passionate the owner and head chef is about his dishes. I highly recommend this new vegan gem to everyone!!! :))"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good place but not mind-blowing. We got the chickpea flour omelette, which was good, but I honestly don't really think it should be called an omelette as much as a salty pancake... We also got the strawberry shortcake crepes, and they were pretty good but definitely more of a pancake than a crepe. It was all really heavy, and the plates are really big, so if you generally eat smaller portions, one plate to share would be perfect unless you want leftovers! I was also a bit disappointed that they use Daiya cheese in everything, as I know its the kind of thing people either love pr despise, so I wish they'd use something like gusta, chao, or earth island, which have gotten much better reviews from pretty much every vegan (and non-vegan) I know!   Would I go back? Maybe, if I was really in the mood for a sort of \"junk food\" meal, but definitely not for a healthy one!  P.S. The butter croissant was actually great and I'd definitely get it again!"}
{"text":"This place is not like other vegan restaurants in the city.  I would describe it as \"Vegan Comfort Food\".  The portions are hug and hearty! The whole place has the \"dinner-next-door\" vibe.  The staff are knowledgeable and friendly.  The cook (maybe the owner?) was super friendly and make sure we like the food, which we did! :)  Was there on a Sunday brunch, very surprise there is no lineup, which is awesome.  But I got the feeling once the words got out how good this place is, we might start to see lineup too.  For now, for me, this place is a somewhat private vegan oasis that I will definitely go back for sure!   The only thing I would mention to take a note is that if you are sitting close to the kitchen, your clothes will smell like \"cooking/kitchen\" for a while, so, seat close to entrance if you want to avoid heavy food smell after."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Montreal and I wanted to try ALL the vegan places in two days. This would prove impossible without a time stopper and more stomachs.  However, Vegano was top on my list and I made sure on my last day to check it out. My friend and I got there around 2pm and it was packed. The brunch crowd was rolling out as we rolled in.  It was busy and the staff notified us it would be around 10 minutes. We waited and the lovely Nicky kept us informed that they were preparing a table.  When we got our table, we saw that the menu changes weekly and what I had planned to get was not available. we decided on the kibbles and grits for my friend and a chicken submarine for myself. We also ordered two coffees.  The food came rather quickly and was large portions, even for two Americans living like ourselves. The food was fresh and had great flavor. The  submarine was on a crispy roll and the seitan chicken was grilled with yellow peppers and caramelized onions. There was a very generous side of fresh baby spinach in a tasty dressing.  We finished everything which impressed Nicky and left feeling satisfied and full. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Such a great Sunday breakfast find. They open a full hour before others, their owner is friendly and it was quiet and welcoming. Oh right - and the food was fantastic! A good vegan breakfast can be so hard to find. But. . .vegan danish you say? No problem. Vegan CROISSANTS? Impossible? INCREDIBLE! Flaky pastry as if made with butter. We may or may not have brought a bag of them home across the border. My wife and I both had the omelette with amazing english muffins, a tasty bit of greens with dressing, and a spectacular house made beet ketchup. We're frequent visitors to Montreal and we'll absolutely be back - you should go there ASAP!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service! Very friendly staff, I love this place!! They are very creative with the dishes, and they served a very good quantity!"}
{"text":"The food here is as good as the staff is friendly! The menu changes every week which is really nice. The radio mostly plays 80's hits and this adds a lot to the friendly atmosphere. The grilled \"cheese\" is amazing (tested 2 in two weeks) and I will definitely return regularly. I have yet to try their evening menu :)"}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis le début du mois de décembre 2016 en plein cur du Plateau, Vegano fut une très agréable surprise. Même si le décor du restaurant peut apparaître assez froid et que le menu \"officiel\" n'est pas encore complètement finalisé (pour le moment, il change à chaque semaine et à chaque jour), osez pousser la porte et profiter d'une cuisine réconfortante et de qualité! Les prix sont amplement raisonnables, les portions sont généreuses et, surtout, on sent que les plats sont confectionnés avec amour et réel intérêt pour le plant-based diet. Il y a définitivement une \"vibe\" familiale qui transparaît à travers l'attention portée à la préparation et la confection des assiettes, les sourires du personnel et la gentillesse du propriétaire. Aussi, on peut compter sur les doigts de nos mains les restaurants à Montréal qui offrent un brunch vegan de qualité: Vegano propose plusieurs options aussi excellentes les unes que les autres (crêpes farcies au fromage et au chocolat tahini, pain doré aux bananes, tofu brouillé avec pommes de terre, omelette, etc.). D'ailleurs, l'omelette, composée à base de pois chiches, fut une révélation! Si jamais vous doutiez encore que la cuisine vegan puisse être à la fois créative, délicieuse et réconfortante, faites-vous une faveur et prenez place à une des tables de Vegano. Une très belle addition au quartier!"}
{"text":"Excellent taste! Excellent recommendation by the chef. We tried the omelette sandwich and French toast. Mocha was flavorful too. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for our first night in Montreal with a bunch of carnivores and it was still a huge hit! everything was delicious, the portions were huge (i'm currently eating leftovers for the third time) and the service was great! only complaint was that the sausages in the risotto tasted more like hot dogs than a traditional italian sausage and while they were tasty, i don't think they went with risotto."}
{"text":"Vegano! Reconnu pour ses gâteaux immenses - comme dans \" une part de gâteau pourrait nourrir une famille de ptérodactyles pour une semaine \" - est un bon spot à connaître.   Généralement, on en sort en roulant, la peau du ventre bien tendue. C'est riche, c'est plein de pâtes, de pain, de riz, de crêpes et de gaufres. Le goût est là, et on est dans le comfort food. Les portions sont TOUTES généreuses. Et malheureusement/heureusement, on veut goûter à tout. Amenez votre plat en vitre pour vos restes! Oui, même au brunch! Vous sauverez des arbres"}
{"text":"It pains me to say this, but Vegano is a down-right disappointment. I want so badly to love this place- the fact that a family got it together to open a righteous and accessible vegan Italian eatery warms my heart. Alas, I have to report that this some of the worst food I've had in a long time.  First of all, the first time we visited, right after the spot opened, we were pretty put off by the poor quality of food and the slow service. That being said, the fact that the owner approached us and personally welcomed us to his new business really made me want to come back and give it another try, especially before posting a review. We procrastinated on visiting again until over a year later (and a completely new location) and ended up regretting it terribly.  Food: my waffles weren't cooked. Like, there was actual waffle batter on my plate that some cook tried to conceal under my salad. The inside of the waffle was gooey and suspiciously dense. The salad (a pile of baby spinach) was swimming in veganaise that had been seasoned with garlic and salt. My boyfriend's plate was an undercooked stack of soy. We both had horrible indigestion afterwards. I will say that I really like their beet ketchup.  Service: while friendly, much like our first visit, we waited for over 45 minutes for not-so-elaborate breakfast plates in a half-empty restaurant at an off time. When the plates finally came to us the server almost brought them to the table beside us (which has been there for 15 minutes). This seemed to be a common issue, and I watched the server get generally pretty confused about where they were bringing plates.  The cherry on top was the space; for some reason they choose not to turn on the light in the shadowy and expansive restaurant. Additionally, the floor was filthy (and trust me, I appreciate a little grunge in a space). I think they could really use an extra couple of bussers, especially during peak brunch days."}
{"text":"Plats copieux, abordable et délicieux ! Situé au coeur du  Plateau, le premier resto italien vegan."}
