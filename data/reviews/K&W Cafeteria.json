{"text":"When K & W first opened we were excited.  I grew up with K & W in Greensboro and in Winston-Salem and now one within a few miles of our house...we were delighted!  At first, it was great with appetizing foods, good service, clean environment, etc.  The past several visits we're greeted with serving staff who act like they hate their job and can care less if you are satisfied.  We have been at varying times and it's hardly ever any better.  The food on the line looks less than appealing, spills not wiped up around the serving containers, and if it's been wiped, it's smeared around.  The servers never smile and slop the food on the plates so you have nowhere to hold the plate unless you get your fingers messed up.  The last times, we've noticed only a 93% health rating.?????  I'm paying you for food and service, do you not care???  I blame it on poor management.  Last week, which may be our last time, we arrived about 7:15 PM.  The food available was dried out and/or empty containers.  We had a hard time finding a clean table.  There were wet cleaning cloths left on tables, at the check-out station, and even on the back of the booth where we ate.  The carpet had several spills that had not been wiped up.  Do you want to stay in business or does it not really matter.  This is the worst K and W we've ever eaten at....BE CAREFUL!"}
{"text":"Very good food, consistently prepared and presented, generous volumes and helpful staff.  This isn't 5 star dining. It's cafeteria food.  But it's cafeteria food done to near perfection.  My favorites include the 7-Layer Salad, Chicken and Dumplings, Chicken Pan Pie, Country Fried Steak, Baked Spaghetti, Turkey and Dressing, Macaroni and Cheese, Fried Okra, Creamed Corn, Yam Souffle and more.  Desserts are also consistent, reasonable and generous in portions (2 people can usually split a pie or cake.)  3 people can easily share 2 desserts and there's more than enough for everyone.  Line servers are helpful and friendly.  There is minimal waitstaff (water refills and the like) but they are helpful and efficient.  They always clean and clear tables quickly.  Lines are usually short and move quickly.  Overall, a favorite place for comfort food and homestyle cooking without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Most people know what they're getting when they go to a cafeteria, good but not outstanding food at a decent price, and this place is the same.  

Finding the place is easy, getting out isn't with Pineville traffic.  Going through the line picking what you want is definitely a reminder of school and the decor will make you think you're in a retirement home.  Also the average age seems to be about 60, I'm almost always the only person under 40 eating there.

Food wise there's plenty of options for meats, veggies, greens, breads and deserts.  I usually get a salmon patty, coke slaw, a slice of pie and a drink for under $7.  Service after you're through the line consists of drink refills and getting empty dishes out of the way.  When you're done you pay at the door and leave, no hassles for signing up for clubs or other stuff no one wants."}
{"text":"I find this cafeteria to be fantastic.  Honestly, I'm confused as to reviews from others claiming otherwise.  The only complaints I've heard about the food are that sometimes the fish are too fatty and sometimes the greens aren't extremely hot when you get around to eating them.  Other than that, they truly have a great selection of food.  Regardless of what I'm in the mood for, I can find something delicious.  My dad, sister and I work together, and for lunch we find ourselves here quite often.  My dad and I literally ate lunch there today and yesterday.  My sister is a vegetarian, and they have a \"veggie plate\" that is priced extremely well.  This plate includes 3 vegetables, and of course you can get more if you'd like.  The people serving the food always appear to be clean, as does the facility itself.  When I go to a cafeteria for lunch, I expect LESS than I get from the Pineville K&W.  My favorite meals include their roast beef, chopped steak, and baked spaghetti.  Kids also eat cheaply here for around $3.50 for the kids meal.  I've literally eaten here hundreds of times, and will continue to."}
{"text":"Great vegetable's , roles and deserts.....and all the entree's are solid as well.  Family of 4 can easily eat for under $25.00.    A family favorite !!"}
{"text":"Sunday for lunch with large family gathering. Everyone got what they wanted to eat Service was attentive with drinks readily refilled. Roast beef was very good au jus was cold, brocolli and concealed cheese not so good, coconut pie yummy, Line was long but late enough in the afternoon that seating was available when we got thru the line."}
{"text":"I am a cafeteria geek. I have great memories of eating at Luby's and Furr's when I was growing up. I was so excited to see K&W open up in this location so I could intro my kiddos to the glories of a cafeteria!

All in all, I was pleased with our visit. Line was long but moved quickly. The food items were clearly labeled which helped immensely to a K&W newbie. More importantly, the staff behind the line spoke clearly and loudly enough to be understood - a must in the cafeteria system. 

Everything we selected was tasty and was homemade (with exception of fries).  This is no Ryan's or Golden Corral with cheese out of a can slopped on gooey noodles. The mac and cheese was homemade, baked mac. Yummy.  My spinach salad was fresh and very tasty.  Of course, this is food that must withstand being in a hot line so the veggies reflect that,  but you kind of expect that going in.  We chose a soft roll and a biscuit and both were great.   

By far the best part of the meal was the lemon cake the boys split. Dessert is a must in a cafeteria trip!  It was divine. Yes, I said divine. No day glow yellow cake mix, this thing was the most aweome, tender white cake with what was maybe a lemon glaze between the layers of icing. Very subtle but so tasty  The icing was awesome too. Seriously. This cake was better than many fancy wedding cakes I've eaten. My 7 yr old wants me to get him one for his birthday!

The incredible thing is that our final bill for all three of us was just over $11. Incredible!  The kids meals are a mere $3.19 and incude an entree, side, bread, treat ( large jello or pudding) and a drink of their choice!  That is the best value you will find anywhere!!  I almost felt guilty about it.  I was sad there weren't more young families there. Lots of seniors (as expected) and empty nesters, but not many young kiddos."}
{"text":"This Cafeteria started in the early 1900's at Winston-Salem about 80 miles north of Charlotte. They now have branches all over the Carolinas and Virginia. They offer a wide variety of everyday family type meals at a very reasonable price. They actually have real scratch cook bakers who make fresh breads, pies and cakes daily. At holidays you can order complete family feasts to take out such as Thanksgiving Dinners. I like being able to go there for a hot dinner vegetable plate for five bucks."}
{"text":"We went there with high hopes and were mostly disappointed.
Was dinnertime and they ran out of fried chicken breasts. Said it would take a half hour to make more (!) Nothing else looked good... mostly \"old people food\" (and I'm 60!) Had baked chicken and it was tasty. My wife and I shared several sides... nothing to write home about. 

Pumpkin pie had pumpkin chunks in it ... kinda weird. Buttermilk pie was delicious but super-sugary.

They did bring me fried chicken to go as an apology for having none... that was nice.

Very nice folks and I wish them well."}
{"text":"Food is good only reason for the two star review is their business hours are not posted anywhere on their website or here on Yelp and they are screwed hours they close at 2:30 in the afternoon buy reopen later ! Not to mention you have no idea what they are serving that day until you get there we only come for a few specific things and been disappointed a few times when they decided not to have it on the menu that day . What's so hard about posting your hours and menu??"}
{"text":"Many choices to please entire family. Super friendly. Not expensive either. Baked spaghetti highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food isn't that great. No taste or very fatty. I don't think I'll be coming back. I don't know why yelp has a problem with short reviews. I really just don't have anything else to say. Good night!"}
{"text":"When I go to a cafeteria, I don't except fine dining and the K&W doesn't disappoint there.  It has the usual selection of jello, salads, fried fish, fried chicken, roast beef, vegetables, slices of cake, and assorted breads.  The prices are reasonable, while the food items can be hit or miss, completely depending on what time of day and/or kind of rush they had.  The service at this location is better than expected though, always get a refill without asking.  Overall, it's okay."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a cafeteria of any kind since high school!  My coworker and I were the youngest ones there, which was not necessarily a bother.  They offer many choices here, but many options were fried (not typically my cup of tea).

I ordered a plate of chicken fingers with fried okra and Brussels sprouts.  The okra and chicken fingers were negligible, though my Brussels sprouts were decent.  My coworker ordered Manhattan meatloaf, which did not look appetizing, but was actually very delicious.  We also split a piece of cheese bread, which was surprisingly not as heavy as I expected it to be; very light and tasty.

The service there was excellent.  Even a woman who was on her break went out of her way to assist me.  The place also seemed clean, which should be expected of a new establishment."}
{"text":"Good ole home cookin - excellent choices excellent prices ! The food is tasty and usually not over salted - don't wait till 8:30 cause it's nothing but left overs but if you go early you'll need patience as the crowd is seniors. The price is right - you can get a good meal with salad veggies and dessert for around $9.00. That's why We love this place. Cafeteria food but nice selections. Wait staff are attentive."}
{"text":"This place does not have good food. The line you wait in is very pressuring. People get up set when you take to long to order. The only time I've come here was because an old person invited me and I didn't want to be rude and refuse. The staff is upsetting and they don't listen very well. Quite frankly the food they serve there resembles the price for which the serve it. Cheap and poor."}
{"text":"We went to this location and was very disappointed.No one acknowledged us, when I did get someone's attention they were very rude. This was about 6:45 and all the staff was trying to close I guess,they were putting the food away. My wife was getting me a piece of pie the lady screamed at us not to touch, she grabbed the pie and said she now had to throw it away. There was no sign that said do not touch.. This lady acted in a very childess manner, we will have to spend our money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love me some K&W good gracious.  It's my get away because of the people mainly.  Reminds me of my grandma and that home cooking.  The sweet tea is always good.  I'll tell you some of my faves.  The baked spaghetti is off the chain.  The chicken pan pie is sooooooo good.  They have Mac and cheese that is decent.  Cornbread is just right.  I like the mashed potatoes and gravy.  If you like greens they have collard greens and they taste pretty good.  They recently started opening for continuous service throughout the day and that's what enabled me to be able to eat there.  The dining room is nothing special and is a bit dated but I'm serious I really enjoy the people and the food here.  The food is of good quality and is always hot.  I know what to expect but this location really tries to keep their a game on lock.  Oh yeah and I brought my dad here who is a diabetic and one of the lady's knew exactly what he could have and what he couldn't. It turned out to the be just the perfect meal when he checked his blood sugar that day.  I'll never forget that thank you so much!"}
{"text":"What a bad place to go eat! OMG! I have never in my whole life, went to any place to eat, with a very hateful and rude MANAGER!!!! My sister and I went to eat there today, and while we were in line ordering out food, my sister was trying to decide on her dessert, she went to reach for the pie plate, and she said, \"I am not sure just yet, which one to get\" she had just got those words out, and that hateful manager started yelling, VERY LOUD, at her, saying \" ma'am, I hope you want that piece of pie, cause if you don't, I gotta throw it in the trash, cause you touched the plate\"! REALLY?? Are you freaking kidding me!!! and he was not just talking or saying it ina nice way, he was almost Yelling in her face, and everybody was looking!! then, the lady serving the drinks, yelled at me\" Ma'am, what do you want to drink\" and she was very loud too! So, these people have got a problem with the public!!! This manager, just so you know, is a short black man, that yells! :-( poor, poor management, no way to get customers to return!! very disappointed! and the food is not that good, they acted like they were doing us a favor by eating there. NEVER AGAIN! Oh, and by the way, I would have gave them a \"0\" star, but there is not an option!! :-("}
{"text":"I had thanksgiving dinner there this afternoon quite a crowd there. The food was delicious. One thing that is needed is more disable parking spaces."}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss and at times an item they had the prior week is not available.  Would be nice if they would post the selections on their website.   But the reason for two rather than three stars is the service at the line.  It's never been very good and always feels like I'm being rushed but I don't appreciate being yelled at because I was waiting on a line servicer to help me.  You want people to move faster?  Hire line servers who can work more than one section of the line."}
{"text":"Nasty. The food here is terrible. I got some Mac and cheese yesterday that was not fit for human consumption. It was a suspicious looking lump and seemed like it had been on someone else's plate who also thought it was disgusting and the restaurant just decided to recycle it."}
{"text":"I visit this location several times a week and know most of the staff and management on a first name basis(and they know excatly what I order everytime!.) Service has always been top notch. Food is usually pretty good if you go within the first 30 minutes they open(11-11:30 for Lunch or 4-4:30 for Dinner). Sometimes it's hit or miss whether how fresh/hot your food will be, depending on how fast certain dishes sell. That's especially the case on Saturday & Sunday when they are open all day. But let me say, when everything is fresh, It is REAL GOOD. The Management staff(Paul & Brian) have gone beyond the call of duty, on the rare occasion I had an issue and it wasn't solved properly. If you're in the area, stop in and have a really good meal. Angel will take great care of you in the dining room and Carol is always a friendly face to see at the Register."}
{"text":"This location has just opened.  It use to be a J&K Cafeteria a few years ago.

Ever since I saw the sign that this was going to be a K&W Cafeteria, I kinda got excited, maybe it is because I am getting older, or maybe it will get some of these people out of my favorite restaurants, so the wait times won't be as bad. I know that is selfish, but hey, let's face it , there are just not enough good eating places near this area.

When my wife and I walked in, we knew it would be busy, the parking lot was full, and the service  line reached all the way to the front door.  It was very cold at the entrance and while in the waiting line I felt I was in a meat box locker.  (The air condition does work- very well, I might add).  As we approached the food area the temperature felt much better and the dining room was very comfortable.

The nice thing about this place was it was new. It has very reasonable prices, good selection, however the food I wanted (broiled salmon) was going to take an additional 10 minutes, as the last 2 pieces were taken by the 2 folks in front of me (bastards!).......very disappointing.  I opted for the Veal Parmesan, not my original choice and since I just had Italian (Mom's Lasagna) the night before at Maggiono's (had baked ziti for lunch via the carry home portion)  I had already passed up my other possible options so I only appeared to hold up the line...... This was disappointing.

I will be back to this location as the newness wears in, and the place settles down a little.  The wait staff was friendly, although I found it somewhat difficult to decipher who was actually going to be helping me with the potential items I wanted in the food line. Sure, they had staff behind the counter, but when I requested several items, I felt awkward, as if I may have been interrupting several of the conversations between them. Did I mention  that I already held up the line when I requested my salmon? It was if they did not know where the salmon came from once it was off the table.......

This location should do well....they herd the folks in, feed em by the trough, offer a good value, and lets face it. this is a cafeteria,

I will follow up on this location, but in the meantime, I have added pictures for your enjoyment.

{"text":"Really awful. Extremely salty. Spent the rest of the day in the bathroom or sleeping. Today not too much better. Never again."}
{"text":"There aren't many places that take you back in time like a cafeteria does.  Walk in and follow the long hallway to the far end and pick up your tray.  You have a chance to view the entire food line as you walk past so you'll know what you want when your turn comes.  None of the food will blow your mind as it's all catered to an older clientele that is watching their diet for various reasons, but it's all reasonably tasty.  The line staff are always standing there at attention in uniform as you move along the line making your choices.  At the end of the line they hand you a receipt before you select your table.  Properly dressed wait staff are buzzing around ready to help by taking your tray away or refilling your beverage.  When you're finished eating you pay at a separate cashier station located near the exit door and you're on with your day having eaten a full meal that's not full of salt, sugar or coated in spices.  Well done from start to finish for a fair price."}
{"text":"K & W is always a good choice for a traditional cafeteria style meal. The variety of items changes daily and there is usually something for everyone. From salads to veggie plates  or the typical meat and two vegetables, patrons are sure to find something to fit the bill. Don't forget about desert, and yes you can have all items boxed to go. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the service was the BEST.  Anton was very helpful and very nice."}
{"text":"Having heard good things about K&W, I decided to check it out on a Sunday evening. I arrived around 6:30 and saw so many options were not available, and they close at 8:00. With that said I did go back up for seconds and did see they had refilled several items.

As for my experience, having never been we decided to try a variety of different items to get a taste of everything. Started with the salad, basically lettuce and cheese, blah!
As for the entrees, we had turkey with stuffing, cranberry and mashed potatoes, ham slices, grilled chicken breast, macaroni & cheese, greens beans and soft rolls.
The ham was probably the best item I tasted. The turkey was bland and stuffing had no flavor. As for the mashed potatoes, ok, but the gravy was nasty. Would not order that again. The green beans are straight from the can. We did enjoy the Macaroni & Cheese, but again somewhat bland. Everything needed salt and pepper. 
Prices are great and service was very nice. Servers attend tables throughout the meal, grabbing refills and cleaning empty plates.
Overall glad I checked it out but not sure I would return. Definitely love cafeteria style restaurants but this wasn't didn't live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"We decided to purchase the Thanksgiving Family Gathering that serves 18-20 people for $115.00.  All we can say is it was great.  The turkey was moist, perfectly sliced, and all the dark meat was in one tray and all the white in another tray. It was a delicious complete meal with all the fixing's. You pull up your car and the staff helps you load it in separate trays.  I want to thank Brian Johnson, Management Team, for helping us decide on our purchase and want to thank all the K&W employees who worked so hard preparing, servings, and for being open on Thanksgiving Day so we didn't have to do any work. We just put everything in the oven to heat up and serve. I just hope all of the staff had as nice of Thanksgiving as we did.
Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Always wonderful home-cooked food just like grandma used to make! The people are always friendly, the place is always clean, and the choices on the menu are always almost too many to pick from. I've eaten several times over the years at this particular location, and I don't think I will ever quit going back. I really like liver and onions, but I'm a little freaked out at cooking liver myself, so when I get a huge craving for it this is my go to place. They always have the best mashed potatoes and gravy and the best pecan pie."}
{"text":"the last time i was in your esablishment i was discrimminated against by one of your waiters who was black and i am white. he did not wait on me so i had to ask one of the workers who was on her break and sitting behind me to bring me coffee refill. he would not come near me.
however when a blalck lady came to the table in front of me  he immediatley came over and waited on her. so it is true you do become the thing you hate. needless to say i have not been back since,such discrimmination in your place. have you been sued yet?
i will never set foot in any of your resterau\nts again nor will my grown kids or my frriends after what i tell them about how i was treated.in your pinevills rest."}
{"text":"Good ole southern cooking. They seriously have grandma I'm the kitchen.  Some of the servers could cheer up a little and be nicer. But over all of you're not much of a cooker and want to feed yourself and your little one a nice, good, hearty home cooked mean, come here."}
