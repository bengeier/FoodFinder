{"text":"Me and my husband have a 19 month old boy and it was our first time leaving him without us.  We dropped him off at the toddler center and he had a blast. They sent us pictures of him smiling playing and gave us relief he is in good hands.  We got to hear the sermon without watching our child with a distraction.  It was wonderful! Found our home church."}

Highly recommend the BLT or a hamburger at the grill.  Even have ESPN on while you eat.  That's my kind of Church!"}
