{"text":"Simple unassuming and great! Been here four times an it's always the simple sushi fresh and served with a smile. And it's very well priced. One note crunchy roles = special Kay cereal sprinkled on top."}
{"text":"Great sushi, but they were very rude on the phone when I ordered. I called this evening to place an order for delivery, and the man yelled at me that they were too busy for delivery, and hung up on me.  I ended up calling back and just placing an order for pick up, and the ladies inside were very nice. 

The food was great tho, good prices too."}
{"text":"We go here often, the tempura is amazing! Minimal staff, but it's a pretty small place so service was still great. Sushi has been very fresh tasting any times we've gone, and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Late night Craving for Sushi. Went to Yume 15 mins before they closed. Chairs were up and floor was in the process of being mopped. Girl graciously welcomed me inside, and told me they were open for me. I had Green tea while waiting. Ordered: California roll, Smoked salmon w/ cream cheese, House roll, and a roll with tempura. Rolls were good I like the sushi at Yume, and the waitress is friendly and is the kind of server I like to have. Enjoyed listening to the family talking to each other in Japanese was nice ambience. I ordered takeout here a couple weeks ago and it was great and packaged nicely, wanted to check out the restaurant this time it is very clean and well looked after. Thanks for staying open for me Yume - I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I tried out Yume after receiving a flyer with 10 percent off. I purchased the spicy tuna rolls, salmon sashimi and Kamikaze rolls. I was very impressed with everything I ordered. The salmon was melt in your mouth and the tuna I couldn't get enough of. I am definitely adding this place to my regular haunts list"}
{"text":"Big fan of yume! Great sushi at really good prices. Only drawback is they don't offer brown rice :("}
{"text":"Ate here few times. Menu isn't that big but the price is Great!! One of the cheapest sushi places I've aten :) service is friendly, and food comes out pretty quick too. Def a good place to go for lunch !"}
{"text":"I'm surprised how low a rating this place got! My hubby and I didn't know this place existed till we got their flyer recently at the place we rented. This has become one of our favorite restaurants! So many sushi restaurants are over priced with mediocre food, we definitely got our money's worth at Yume.

Fresh fish, rolls that aren't just stuffed with rice, extensive menu, great kitchen cooked dishes (must try baked oyster, they are huge!), reasonable prices (great prices!). My only complaint is that there's a bit of a wait after you order, but once the food comes...enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent prices and cozy ambience made this sushi house stand out. Not top of the line but a great neighborhood treat to have around."}
{"text":"I have always been impressed with he prices and the quality at yumi. This is our go-to sushi spot, and the few times we stay and sit we are really happy with he service.

As far as particular dishes go, we usually don't have anything fancy, salmon sashimi and maybe a dynamite roll.

Really good, not 5 stars, but really good for the price."}
{"text":"A few more visits and I'm ready to bump the rating up to a 4. Granted, this is 4 stars in the context of a value oriented neighborhood sushi joint, not 4 stars in the context of just-short-of-perfection fine dining experience.

So what makes it rate up to 4?
Value: $1 nigri is way better than I'd expect for a buck. Stick with the more common cuts to ensure freshness; mackerel and snapper have been sub-par a couple of times, but salmon, tuna, and shrimp have been consistently great. Maki is well priced too, though sometimes the over-stuffed creative rolls can be apt to implode between your chopsticks.

Choice: A nice selection of appetizers and izayaka type items will tempt you away from a basic sushi feed. Potato corokke and various grilled meat on sticks have been good, but the standout has to be the cheesy miso baked oysters (motoyaki). Miso, mozzarella, lemon, oyster...these things bring the umami bomb and demand to be washed down with cold beer. 

Service: Has always been very, very friendly. Whether stopping in for a quick after work beer and sushi break, or settling in for a feed with a rice-flinging toddler in tow, the servers have been quick, thoughtful with plates and plastic glasses for the little one, and very cheerful.

Perhaps not a destination you'd go out of the way for, but if you're in the south, this should be your sushi local."}
{"text":"What a great little family run restaurant!  It was quite exciting to have it open up in this location.  
I went in a few weeks ago, not really sure what I wanted and was looking at the menu to decide.  As I was sitting there - the chef pulled out a couple of baked oysters with mozarella cheese - I told him that it looked interesting, and the next thing he gave me one for free!   Talk about fantastic customer service.  
The sushi is great!  And the prices are right.  Oh - and try that oyster thing... Its really good.
JDB."}
{"text":"Miso, tempura and sushi sounded like the perfect end to a fun evening with the fam. So where to go in south Calgary. By sheer good  luck, we discovered Yumi Sushi in the Avenida  mall. It has a most unassuming exterior so we were surprised at how large it is inside. Looking around, I searched for the ubiquitous sushi river, sushi train, or long curving sushi bar which I'd come to expect in these places. Nada. In fact this is a basic \"sit down and eat\" kind of joint. Curiously however, I noticed a row of wooden boats dry docked on the bar at the back of the room.

We went basic and ordered miso, mixed tempura and a variety serving of sushi. In no time the miso and tempura arrived and then came the wooden boat. This boat cum serving  platter is the size of a new born's crib. It had to be turned diagonally to fit our four top table. Inside the boat rested a fresh yet uninspired selection of this restaurant's namesake. It was certainly enough to eat and the quality was good however there was nothing in it that hasn't been served millions of times. We were pleased with the prices and will certainly return-they had floated our boat."}
{"text":"We used to come here lots - weekly! Then something changed. The food wasn't as fresh tasting, the fry wasn't as crisp... 
Eat in is always better than take away, but we had done take away successfully lots of times before too.
After two less than mediocre dinners we feel it is time to move on.
We don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"My family and I went here, because the Vietnamese resto that was adjacent to the Japanese Sushi bar was closed.
I didn't have any expectations, but went in having some reservations about eating here. 
First let me say that the service was good, and the waitresses were friendly. The sushi chefs greeted upon entry, and while exiting.
Now on to the food. You get a menu, and then you fill out one of those disposable type menus that have the sushi list and a few hot items or Entrees.
The sushi, when looking at the list seemed to be a good deal. $1.00 for sushi, certain ones anyways. We ordered the Tamago sushi, inari sushi, both were listed for $1.00. We also ordered the california roll and the spicy chiken roll,+ the futomaki rolls. I also ordered the chicken teriyaki chicken entree, and potato croquettes.
When our sushi came out, I right away noticed how small the sushi was. The tamago sushi was cut very thin, and the rice underneath was sparse. The inari sushi, was also very small. These are the sweet bean curd pockets, that are filled with sushi rice. They were half the size of what I have normally seen in other Japanese sushi bars. I don`t get it, rice is fairly cheap and they shouldn`t skimp. The Teriyaki Entree was accompanied by a bowl of Miso soup .This is pretty standard with most dinner selections. When the main entree came to the table, I have to say it looked a little baron. They maybe should use smaller bento boxes to make the portions appear larger. The box came with IMO, a small amount of chicken and some rice with salad. The chicken was very fatty, and every piece had either fat or harder to chew cartilage type stuff on it. and one piece appeared not cooked enough. I saw the presence of blood from the side. (I neglected to eat that piece.) The rice and salad were okay. Also the potato croquettes were good.
As for the rolls, the futomaki roll was small in comparison to other bars I`ve been to.
In conclusion, I don`t think I`ll be making a return visit to Yume`s despite the friendliness of the servers.
After all, I would rather put up with mediocre service and excellent food than have okay food and exceptional service.
After everything was said and done, this made for a relatively expensive lunch. 

The total came to around $60.00, and that without anything to drink. Just green tea and water for the four of us. Two adults and two kids, and one being 4 years old and hardly eating at all."}
{"text":"Living on the South end of the city, I was never close to any good places for a good casual sushi experience. Recently, I have been delightfully surprised by the number of places that are starting to pop up out here. Places like Yokozuna in Okotoks and Southland Crossing as well as the Chinook location of Globefish have been welcome  additions to the otherwise subpar choices that are available south of Glenmore Trail.

As the sushi landscape is evolving, so is the quality of the menu items. It is important to note that a sushi bar that satisfies the casual diner doesn't necessarily have to have a veritable ocean of fresh seafood selections available at any given time, or an elaborate presentation, using giant mounds of crushed ice and weathered driftwood to make a statement. Really, all you need is a few choice fish of the freshest quality, sensible pricing and a pleasant customer experience to tie it all together and Yume Sushi does all that.

The dining room is spacious and colourful, adorned with traditional Japanese art and dolls that line the shelves throughout the space. It is contemporary, yet inviting enough to want to sit at the bar. Service is very casual, using the menu & pencil system to make your choices (the colour menu has photos for those who may be newer to sushi dining).

The menu includes a good selection of sushi and sashimi in addition to the ever-popular plethora of rolls, hot food items and salads. Also available are the bento lunch specials and love boats you see everywhere. The quality and freshness of the fish is good, the sushi is well made with a fair balance of fish to rice. Sashimi slices are slightly thinner than the norm, but are not overly skimpy. 

The tempura is golden, crispy and plentiful. The portion size of the large assorted is very generous with large pieces of fresh vegetables and plump shrimp. 

With a good number of sushi choices for $1, you really can't go wrong at Yume. It's a great place to stop for a nice, casual dinner or lunch for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi at reasonable prices. Each time I've gone I have felt that the sushi has been quite fresh. Menu is quite comprehensive and service is friendly. Especially liked the Phoenix roll and found the chef's special rolls to be quite generous in size. Feel as though the hand cones are a bit overpriced but they are really tasty too and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I regularly eat at this nice little sushi place in Avenida.  It's about 3 blocks blocks from Canyon Meadows Cinema so it's great for an inexpensive meal and a cheap movie.  
The food is always very fresh and well presented."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Overall experience: 3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I've passed by this place so many times while driving, and I finally got the chance to stop by after my bf and I wanted a snack. What caught my eye the most was their advertising for $1 sushi and I just had to see for myself.

Yume is fairly small (located in a strip mall next to TD bank) but is large enough to hold a couple large groups. It's a very elegant sushi restaurant with warm, dark, wooden tables, chairs and beige accents that doesn't make it your typical Japanese themed restaurant. We went late in the afternoon so we were the only ones there which was nice. The service is very friendly, and is definitely a family run business. The waiter explained the menu to us and the difference between sashimi and sushi which is informative for a first timer, but unnecessary and a bother for sushi veterans. It was still a really nice gesture of them and I guess a nice way to connect more with the customer. My only complaint was how our water was warm and icky because they didn't add ice. 

Although they may not be Japanese (unless Japanese people speak Cantonese haha) the sushi is pretty decent. The prices for some of their rolls and hot foods are average for Calgary, but their $1.00 sashimi/sushi special is the cheapest I seen in Calgary. We ordered 5 pieces of salmon sashimi, 5 pieces of salmon sushi, white tekka maki roll (white tuna $3.20/6 pieces) and negi toro maki roll (tuna belly, green onion $4.50/6pieces). The sushi is fresh and tasted pretty decent; it was good but not melt in your mouth sashimi goodness. The portion size is reasonable for the price, with each piece being about 3 inches. The rice was properly prepared with the right amount of vinegar and stickiness. 

Overall, I would give this place a visit for CHEAP and decent tasting sushi. It's definitely more affordable than Sakana grill who's sushi/sashimi still costs over a dollar during their happy hour, and at pretty much every other sushi place in Calgary. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very inviting. I would definitely come back to try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"Small, friendly, new and clean.   Nicely prepared sushi and sashimi.  Very casual.

Had Caterpillar Roll,   Dynamite Roll, Unagi, Shake, Cajun Shrimp, Gyoza, an the omelette things (cant remember the name).     $31 for two.  Parking is not a problem in the evening but expect it would be so at lunch.   Caterpillar begged for a photo, sorry I didn't take one.

Nice addition to the NW.  For some reason there are few restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Good sushi considering you're in Calgary (nowhere near the coast) and it's cheap.  The service was great, they truly seemed to enjoy serving their customers.  I had some sashimi and rolls along with miso soup and it was all good.  Only reason I couldn't rate a 4 was their beer selection.  What Japanese restaurant doesn't several Sapporo in the can?  Ugh."}
{"text":"After living in Vancouver for 12 years it's been a challenge finding sushi that good in Calgary. We've found some decent places but most are just okay and way over priced. This placed is by far the best quality, the fish melts in your mouth and the rolls are great. In addition the price is good too. This is my new regular and for anyone that likes actual sushi this place is a real gem. I'm shocked it only has 3 stars, I've been here 3 times now and the quality has never wavered."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out for the dollar sushi. For a $1.00, I wasn't expecting much.
First - the tuna belly roll with green onion. More than decent. Very flavourful, good portion of tuna belly and the rice was pretty good. I would pass on the salmon nigiri next time - it tasted a bit weird. The tuna and chop scallop were fine. Prices are dirt cheap. Next time, I think I'll sample more of the rolls rather than the nigiri. If you don't know \"good/fresh/well cut pieces of nigiri/sashimi\", then you'll love this place and save a ton of money. Picky sushi eaters should stick to their regular haunts. I mean, if you insist on type of quality that Wa's/Sushi Klub, then you'll be disappointed. Keep the price in mind when you judge the food here. Personally, I enjoyed getting a big meal for $10.00. Worth checking out - you won't be dropping over $100 per couple - that's for sure."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant at least half a dozen times since it opened about a year ago.  While it is no where near the best sushi in town, it is no where near the worst either.  It is generally more affordable than most in town if  your order some $1 sushi/sashimi with your meal.  Some of the rolls are actually quite pricey considering how many pieces you get.  The quality of food is generally good, but sometimes you do get the odd one that doesn't taste as expected.  For example, I thought the special scallop sauce could have been creamier (i.e., with more mayo).  

Overall, it is not a bad sushi place if you need a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"Great takeout sushi. Large portions and quick service. Rolls were plentiful and filling. Sashimi was generous and fresh."}
{"text":"Not the best. The place is a dingy little sushi spot tucked away behind a strip mall. As usual, I ordered my standard tempura appetizer and the closest thing on the menu I could find to a red dragon roll. The tempura was mediocre: the vegetables were gigantic, and over-battered. The sushi (I ordered the Phoenix roll) was equally bland - the rice was dull and flavourless, and there was just too much of it, packed both around the roll AND inside along with the filling. The tempura shrimp had evidently been fried a while ago, and was somewhat soft already. The fish tasted ok. 

Granted, the portions are quite big, so if you're looking for calories, this place will serve you well. The service wasn't bad either. I think I'll be going elsewhere unless I'm stuck with no alternatives."}
{"text":"Good Sushi, great price. Service is hit and miss but 2 out of 3 ain't bad.

Particularly recently the service has gone downhill (with a few staff notably). 

There was a girl there a while ago, and for all I know she may still be, and she was great; exceptional even. 

We've been going there since they opened. 

We only do take out now due to the service; but imho it's still a gem in its own way."}
{"text":"First time here for sushi, i'm surprised that this place doesn't have dragon eyes but i'm sure they can make it easily. It's a good place to have a quick dine or sit down and chit chat. Atmosphere is quite dim but still visible to see your food. Taste is satisfying if you haven't ate for awhile. Staff is friendly and parking is moderately big but shared with other stores nearby. Doesn't seem to get too busy here for a sushi place. Washrooms are well kept. I feel as though the taste isn't as comparable to many other sushi places but maybe that's because my group chose less variety sushi rolls. If I do comeback here i'll have to try their box combos. I am familiar with what's in the those boxes plus it feels the same like other sushi places. So it shouldn't be too different.
Recommended for people who like to eat sushi and try different sushi areas."}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery for pickup and most of the food was pretty good. 

One of the rolls I ordered was the dinosaur roll. All I could taste while eating it was toxic fuel. It was obvious that the outside of the roll was seared with a blowtorch. From the taste it was obvious that the chef hadn't had the torch lit before pointing it at the roll. The result was a roll that was sprayed with fuel and sent home with me. 

I called after I tasted it to explain what happened and the value of the roll was refunded.  Will be the last time I order take out from this place!"}
{"text":"One busy place, was there for an hour and saw around 5 pickups.

The caterpillar roll was tasty, nice tempura and avocado.

But the pork gyozas were just a tad too much ginger.

And server was nice enough to say the egg tamago was brought in from a supplier, quite common even in Vancouver.

this is still a 4star for the overall food, value, and atmosphere in this burb, just nothing to knock your feet off."}
{"text":"Yume is ok. Not great, but not bad. The worst thing about this place is their inaccuracy. The sushi you do get is usually pretty tasty, but the last four, yes, FOUR, times we've either ordered take-out or dined it, they've screwed something up or missed part of our order entirely. Each of these last four times I'd ordered salmon sashimi and never got it. It's definitely a problem when you order take-out as there's no real way to check it's all there before you leave with it. 

The sushi is good. Just make sure you actually get what you pay for so you aren't ripped off a few extra dollars."}
{"text":"Was a nice little spot. Glad I found it. The presentation was nice. Service was mediocre. Food was good. All around decent place to go to."}
{"text":"I know I know. Enough with the sushi. I'm sorry, I can't help it. When I'm on a kick...well...I'm on a kick. I dropped into Yume Sushi quite honestly by accident. My plans for the evening got delayed and I randomly turned into a parking lot to rethink my direction. Low and behold sitting in front of me was Yume Sushi. Haven't made a good mistake like this in a long time (or at least one I'm willing to share in public lol). Ahem...

So the sushi was quite delicious and once again I lucked out with fair pricing. The staff was very friendly and overall it was a nice quiet little location. I'll be back again although not until I'm in that part of town again. It was good, but not travel across the city for good.  
10/30"}
{"text":"OK... so I've been back a few times now and they seem to have hired more people which is better... but still not great as they just training them, but they are friendly.

Food has been consistently the same so far.
Rolls are not too creative
The spider roll looks pretty good (allergy to crab) and for $12.95 a good choice. 
Their spicy tuna crunchy roll is a spicy tuna roll with cornflakes on top.
Can't remember what else I've had, but mostly I order some nigiri from their $1 sushi menu (which can also be ordered as sashimi) and a couple rolls.  nigir/sashimi slices are a bit thinner than some places but I personally don't like thick pieces so I have no complaints about the thickness of the slices.

They have a love boat as well as party platters. I wouldn't order the boat again as it just didn't seem like there was that much on there. I'd order separate things.
The one thing that isn't great is their bento box selection - my mom doesn't eat raw fish and there's not much for her to choose from.

On the tables, standard is normal soy sauce, light soy sauce, and their homemade soy sauce.

Still an ok for a take-out/casual neighborhood south sushi joint."}

Surely not the worst Japanese cuisine in Calgary, but as more Japanese restaurants open up in the NW area, I would have to say the competition is better.  We had a reservation for friday night because we thought it would be busy.  When we arrived at 7pm, there were only 2 other tables occupied other than our own.  I think this was a good indication already, since Friday night should be relatively busy at any restaurant that's been around for over a year.  We were seated promptly, but our server disappeared and never came back to ask if we wanted drinks even though she was not busy.  We sat for a good 15 minutes before she came to see if we wanted tea.

When this restaurant was recommended to be by a friend, I think it was for 2 reasons:  \"cheap\" and \"convenient\".  I would say the first is deceiving.  When you first see the $1 sushi, you would think \"Wow!  This is a great deal since most restaurants are $3-$4 for 2 pieces!\"

Not so fast.  The underlying purpose of a restaurant is to make money, so if it is cheap... then well... you have to expect them to be cutting costs somewhere.  Even knowing this, we just hoped that the quality of fish and the skill of the chef is decent enough that we don't get sick.  Thankfully, our tummies were fine afterwards and the taste wasn't bad, though I wouldn't say very authentic  (the rice was crumbly and unseasoned).  The sashimi is paper thin, but that's expected.

My main problem is the size of each individual piece of sushi.  It was... small.  If I were to guess, I would have to say it's probably less than 50% the size of the average sushi you normally see, with very little rice to fill you up.  It may be only $1/piece, but you can easily each twice as many pieces as you normally would elsewhere, so I wouldn't exactly call it a deal.

Well, those were the $1 sushi... the other sushi rolls seemed to have decent prices on the menu, ranging from the usual $5 range for the smaller rolls, and up to $11 for the \"giant\" special rolls.  We decided to try the Mango roll, which was labeled as being the popular \"giant roll\" for $11, being one of the most expensive rolls they offer.  I was... disappointed.  It was far from giant, I wouldn't even call it large.  I can't really describe to you how big it is, but I can tell you that they should not charge $11 for it as there were only 5 pieces smaller than your average Futomaki roll.  We also tried the dynamite roll, which was around $7.  Again, tiny and skimpy on the \"filling\".  Possibly a tad bit bigger than your normal plain cucumber rolls.  (As in, smaller than your average california rolls.)

I understand that if you are out to eat sushi, you should be expecting to spend quite a bit of money.  However, I think for the amount I spent in Yume Sushi, I could've easily spent it elsewhere for better quality sushi and service.  There were 4 of us (3 women and 1 man).  2 of us weren't hungry to begin with, and at the end of our meal 2 of us left without being full.  The bill rang up to be $90.  At least they didn't charge us for the tea like most other places do.

Oh, and as for convenience... I prefer going to Kinjo if it's in the NW area.  But if I don't mind a lil driving... there's better places in Calgary for sure.  if you love sushi and eat it often, Yume Sushi may not satisfy you.  If you aren't as picky as me and live in the area, this restaurant isn't busy and would provide a quick sushi fix should you have the craving."}
{"text":"I went here with a girlfriend and we both thought the quality was so so. I love sushi and so aren't satisfied with sub par stuff and in my opinion, this was. I like my sushi carefully prepared, delicious and fresh. We ordered rolls and whatever was on the menu offered to us, and the price wasn't super cheap or super expensive. 

The ambiance of this restaurant was like a chain restaurant - large leather booths and bad acoustics. If you're not picky about sushi and anything goes, then fine. But I wouldn't waste my money or time for this place unfortunately. Maybe I'll give it another try one day if I'm desperate since it's close to where I live and hope for the best, but I doubt I will."}
{"text":"Yume Sushi is not bad and it's not phenomenal either. Their rolls are pretty tasty and consistent. Their sashimi and raw fish is not the best and it's not the worst either. 

If you want to eat sushi rolls, Yume is great for that. Their takoyaki is pretty awesome as well. We always have to order it when we go there for food. 

Service is pretty good as well, we are always greeted as soon as we enter. The food also comes to our table quickly and consistently.

I would give Yume 4 stars, but I think the restaurant needs a good renovation. New paint, better art, and just a good overall update to make the restaurant atmosphere better.

Also, we have come to the restaurant a couple of times and have found the door to be closed during their business hours. We had to call and have someone open the door to let us in. 

Overall, would recommend Yume for your typical lunch hour, quick bite to eat, and take out."}
{"text":"Yume is great!  Price, service, location, quality - all good!!!

Glad there is a good sushi place close to home again!!"}
{"text":"Yume Sushi just opened on August 26, 2010.  I can see this place taking off.  It advertises $1 Sushi/Sashimi!!  Yes, you read correctly - $1 SUSHI/SASHIMI!  

We ordered the following off their sushi list:
Special Scallop - pretty good
Unagi - very fresh and delicious
Tamago - great!
Avocado - well-made and smmooooooth
Shake - raw salmon - a little on the thin side but a fair size - can't complain for $1 / piece
Inari - great!
Smoked Salmon - great!

We also ordered:
Caterpillar Roll - prawn tempura, avocado, flying fish roe, Japanese mayo - well-blended and satisfying
Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll - a twist on the usual spicy tuna roll - cornflakes on top of the tuna roll! - adds a crunch to every bite.
Mixed Tempura - prawns were good; yam ok
Pork Gyoza - Really good!  Very fresh.  Great dipping sauce.

All this complimented with a BIG glob of wasabi and a pile of ginger.

Total bill for 4 people came to approx $60!! (excl tax and tips)

Looks like a family-run business.  Lots of people stopped by to pick up a menu.  

Parking could be a problem as the lot is really small."}
