{"text":"Best Thai place around, unfortunately it appears it's closed :-(

I can't find anywhere as good as 7 Star, food was always fresh, inexpensive, awesome taste and great service. Will be missed"}
{"text":"Nice Thai food restaurant. 

This is casual restaurant located by Eglington Ave. and Warden Ave. in the Scarborough area of East Toronto. 

This place features a patio, group functions, catering, free parking in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"my friends and i thought, this place must be rated great given its name and a few parking lot drive-bys...or maybe they were over confident in their abilities?

This is my second posted review which just so happens to be thai food again and another 10-thumbs down!

The place was empty when we arrived at 7pm on a Sat nite - oh no!  Service is so relaxed that the woman keeps overlooking our empty tea pot.  \"excuse me, can we get some more tea?  oh sure\"

then we order a few appetizers...the beef skewers were so dry - even beef jerky is jucier!  tastes like leather too!  and the peanut sauce....looked like carmel with nuts - go figure.  I said to the waitress, \"the beef skewers were too dry\".  she said, \"oh ok\".

I could keep going on the -(ve)s but let jump the the positieves:

- fried spring rolls were good, but who could you go wrong by frying?  so long as you don't burn 'em.
- fried fish with corriander sauce was good too, but that's it! 
- oh, the pop was nicely chilled in the cans =)

Then towards end of our meal, a few of us felt sooooo bloated - one of my buddies went to the can and ripped one so loud that the near empty resto heard the echos of his explosion.

Then i quickly went home and expelled a 5-sec ripper!

i wouldn't say that the food made us sick, but we can conclude that it made a few of us so gasy!!!

and this place aint $$$ cheap.  it came out to $25pp for 5ppl - 3 appetizers, 3 mains, and a few cans of pop.

save your money, start betting when this place will fold."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this place is still open so call first. It would be a big loss. This place was sooo good and a very reasonable cost."}
