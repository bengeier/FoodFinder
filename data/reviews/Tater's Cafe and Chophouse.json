{"text":"I've been back a few times now and the service is definitely better.

I'd recommend giving this place a try, tho I can only speak to the Eggs and Chorizo, as I haven't branched out and tried anything else. I'm glad that I can find something different (from the norm) here for breakfast in Stoughton.

Also the Wireless is a big competitive advantage since no one else offers it (save for fast food places) in town."}
{"text":"I live in Stoughton and after driving by a few times decided to stop in to Tater's.  We were literally the only table seated in the place.  They offer a large menu with a lot of variety, for better or worse.  I would say that the burger selection is the standout, with many gourmet options to choose from.  

My wife and I both ordered burgers (priced around $8, add $1 for pretzel roll). They were cooked perfectly and had great flavor, no complaints.  I had the side of regular fries and slaw, she upgraded (another $1) for the sweet potato fries.  Both of our fries were \"meh\" at best. They appear to be fresh and handcut, but were soggy and wet with grease rather than crispy.  Slaw was good, heavy on the Miracle Whip type flavor, which is what I like. 

Service was good, although again, we were the ONLY people in the place. The only 'ambiance' was a radio station playing in the background, and the sounds of the owners speaking to a friend about how slow business has been, employee troubles, etc.  

Bottom Line: Good burger place, with some areas for improvement.  I really hope they make it, but unless they offer outstanding food for the prices (not soggy fries), improve the ambiance, and focus their menu, I think it will be an uphill battle. 

I do plan to try them again in a couple months to see how things are going."}
{"text":"Taters is trying to be too many things.  The name says it all \"Tater's Cafe and Chophouse\".  That's too much.  Stoughton does not have a chophouse but it is a stretch to call this place a chophouse.  Drive 25 minutes to Madison and go to Tornado for a chophouse experience.  Tater's has Steaks, Gyros, Burgers, Prime Rib, Fish fry, Baked Potato Bar, etc. on the menu but it doesn't do anything well.  I felt like Chef Gordon Ramsay should come here. 

Negatives:
- My wife ordered red wine and it came out cold.  Don't offer it if you don't know how to treat it.
- Heard the head waitress say \"Make sure you use the old tartar sauces before you use the ones you just made\"  Oh man.  How long have those tartar sauces been sitting around?
- My burger looked like it wasn't grilled or put on griddle.  It just looked gray and had a lack of flavor.  The bun was flat too.
-The fries looked like they were handcut, which I appreciate.  But they came out pretty oily and weren't seasoned.  Couldn't taste any salt.
- The baked potato came out warmed but not steamy hot.  They might be pre-cooking these and then re-heating for convenience.  It just was average.   If you call yourself Tater's, make sure your baked potato is the best.  
- You can hear everything the wait staff is saying.   

Positives:
- They had some interesting takes on burgers that if executed well would be a reason to come here.
- Our servers were friendly and swift"}
