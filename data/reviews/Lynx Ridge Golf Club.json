{"text":"It's a good place to spend the day! Large drives in a nice neighborhood. One of the best courses in Calgary in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was at Lynx quite a few years back when my employer held a golf tourny. I remembered how nice it was, so I wasn't surprised that friends of ours held their wedding reception here.

Because the reception was held on a Friday at 6, we had to battle with the rush hour traffic a bit to get here and the parking lot was pretty full from golfers finishing up their day out on the course.

It was a relatively small group in attendance (about 70 or so), so the main banquet room (Vista room) of the club house worked out perfectly. The view is amazing, it overlooks the lush green course and the sunset added a nice touch.

Dinner was buffet style, set up in the adjoing Ridge Room (which would later be turned into a dance floor). There was the basics (field greens, caesar salad, assorted picked veggies and cheese platter), sides of mashed potatoes, steamed seasonal veggies, spinach stuffed canneloni complimented the roasted pork tenderloin and roast beef (with yorkshire pudding). 

I thought the food was really delicious and fresh. I think because it was a smaller group, they were able to manage the food better and it didn't feel like they made batches and reheated everything just before we ate.

In addition to the wedding cupcakes and candy station (which was provided by the bride & groom), the catering had assorted cakes and pies and a chocolate fountain with fresh fruit and marshmallows. 

I'm not against a cash bar by any means (a wedding is EXPENSIVE!), but drinks were pretty pricey ($6 for domestic beers and glasses of wine)

This venue was perfect for this party size, I know Lynx can cater to bigger groups but I think you would loose out on having a dance floor or option to do buffet."}
{"text":"Beautiful course with nice views. Challenging but fare with multiple tee boxes. Nice clubhouse with good food. Somewhat expensive compared to comparable courses with regular rates of $110. Would rate a 5 star if not for this."}

What does that have anything to do with golf... I don't know, I don't golf... yet ;-)

Our firm facilitates a monthly workshop for our clients and we have been using the services of Lynx Ride for over a year now. From monthly workshops to year dinners, banquets and client awards nights.

Why? 

For starters, I don't think you can beat the view anywhere else in Calgary. We see a beautiful panoramic view of the snow capped Rockies... not to mention the landscaping surrounding Lynx Ridge.

More importantly though, it's the people. Kevin Cuffley is the Food & Beverage Manager at Lynx Ride. He and his team of staff are terrific. 

Every month we have a room fully of hungry clients - hungry for information and of course food. We of course have attendees with specific dietary needs - so whether it's a gluten free meal, vegetarian, low carb, high protein or just straight up coffee through an I.V. ... Kevin and his team deliver! 

We bring our own technology - projector, screen, etc... and Lynx Ridge provides us with a  wifi for our workshop... and of course the tables, chairs, linens and anything else to make it a productive and stress free day.

Location is great (though our deep south clients may disagree ;-) 
  *  Parking... and lots of it
  *  The view... green space and mountains... snow capped mountains
  *  Food is fantastic... did I mention the coffee i.v.
  *  Wireless availability
  *  And most importantly... terrific, professional, accommodating, staff

So, if you're looking for a venue for what ever reason... wedding, workshop, quiet meeting spaces, Christmas parties, birthday, lunch, corporate banquets... even golf... come by Lynx Ridge. I'm sure you'll be just as impressed as we have been.

Thanks again to all the staff at Lynx Ridge who take such great care of us and our clients."}
{"text":"A very disappointing and overpriced Mother's Day Brunch.  The food either lacked any flavour, was dry and overcooked, or soggy and watery.  It has a nice view and was a good place to come with kids (except for the chocolate fountain - a good idea in concept, but I'm sure the Moms out there would like one day off from chocolate-covered kids!).  At $35.00 a head (kids under 5 were free though), I felt this was a complete waste of money and would not come back for brunch."}
{"text":"This is a great golf course.  The driving range is easily accessible.  The food here is great too and reasonably priced.  Sunday brunch is fantastic though slightly over priced.  However, the food served at brunch is very good and there's lots of options including some seafood.  Pro shop is easily accessible and carries current clothing and golf items.  Staff are friendly too.  Enjoy!"}
