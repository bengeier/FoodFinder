{"text":"Went to dinner before a 7:30 show at the Ohio theater. There were three of us having dinner. We all started with a romaine salad - a take on a caeser - which was delicious. Two of us ordered the Cod and one had the Giant Pork Shank. The cod was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It was served with Spinach, Pureed Parsnips and a beurre blanc sauce. The parsnips were good, as was the spinach. The sauce was sweet, which was unexpected  and combined with the natural sweetness of parsnips was a little too sweet.  The pork shank was delicious and my companion loved it. For dessert we split the meringue with salted caramel ice cream. We choose it after reading the reviews on Yelp. This is sooo good it would be worth a trip for this dessert alone.   Overall it was a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Cold bread. Server rushed us  to order. The arugula salad was good.  Fettuccine Carbonara  was a  plop of noodles with an egg and some bacon pieces, virtually flavorless.  A friend ordered and received a tiny $15 pizza that was also disappointing.  We didn't bother taking the unfinished food home.  Perhaps we just hit on the two least impressive entrees on the menu, but we won't return to find out."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this restaurant while vacationing in Cleveland from IL.  My husband and I were walk ins on Friday night.  We were seated right away.  We we served water, bread right away but no waiter.  During this long wait, the manager,Rob Labuda has walked pass a couple of times and noticed we had not been waited on and he came over to take our drink order and brought it back himself.  Shortly afterwards our waiter came.  The food was good as well as dessert.  Manager Labuda brought us a complimentary class of port wine to go with our dessert!  This made the oversight  disappear!  We would come back to this restaurant if we visited Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"I recently revisted Cowell and Hubbard. The meal and drinks were outstanding as well as the service!  I Highly recommend this restaurant if you are visiting Cleveland or live there and want an amazing dining experience. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Normally I would give them 5 starts, however we were told a few months ago they no longer take reservations for the bar area. Ok so we come down 2-3 hours before a show to get a seat at the bar....wow for the past 3 months they have had reserved signs at the bar....gee thought you didn't do that any more. So tonight we do our usual...I drop off my handicapped mother..I go park, walk over get my drink and the manager comes over says do you have reservations? We said no you no longer take them for the bar area...he said well we did today and all these are reserved. WTF!! So we had to leave! Basically we were kicked out. We have been long time customers of all of Zac's places....that ended today! I can't believe these are the people you would employ! Such a sad day! Thank god the old reliable in the Buckley Building was happy to have us!"}
{"text":"Another Zack Bruell Gem! I was disappointed my favorite Cleveland waiter, Phoenix, wasn't working the night I came in. My waiter Penny was friendly, informative and made the evening fun! The Manager, Nathan, came over to make sure everything was perfect and recommended a superb wine. Of course the food was amazing, like the rest of Zack's restaurants. I highly recommend you give Cowell & Hubbard a try. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Went on double date there for Valentines Day.  The restaurant was packed and very loud, but all the food was amazing.  Service was what one would expect on a very busy night.  Appetizer: Escargot, in a garlic butter sauce with bread crumbs, enough to split with 4 people.  Entre√©: Atlantic Cod, served with a great blanc sauce and spinach.  Dessert: Hazelnut Cheesecake with orange sauce, I don't know why it was good but it was."}
{"text":"Baked apple desert was a little sweet for my taste, but otherwise great beef ceviche and lamb breast."}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriend after a concert and sat at the bar for a late dinner. L'Albatros is one of my favorite restaurants in town so I was naturally very excited to try Cowell & Hubbard for the first time. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm quickly waned as the service was ATROCIOUS. I had to flag down one of the bartenders (who were much more interested in getting a jump start on their closing duties) and ask for -literally- (yes, correct use) everything: \"Excuse me, could we see menus?\"; \"Excuse me, we'd like to order wine,\" \"Sir, we'd like to order our entrees,\" \"Miss, could we please have some of the bread and olive oil you just served the couple sitting next to us?\"; \"Sir, could we please have two waters?\"; \"Miss, please bring back our water glasses, we weren't through.\" I think you get the point, and that was all BEFORE our entrees even came out! It was exhausting!  The menu was what I've come to expect from Zack Bruell - nothing too adventurous but several very good options. Unfortunately my girlfriend's scallops came out COLD, like 'we didn't even bother putting these under a heatlamp' cold, and no one on staff stopped by to check on us or seemed to care. I paid (after flagging someone down for the check, naturally), left a bad tip, and bounced. I'd like to give this place a 1.5/5 based on the food, but I can't. Maybe have the staff from L'Albatros venture downtown and do some training.  Oh! And I heard someone at the bar requesting the \"Actor's Menu\" - WTF? You are on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, NOT Broadway in NYC, homie. Yikes."}
{"text":"Tried to give C&H a second try and both times have been sorely disappointed. Wait staff was great but food mediocre at best. Seafood risotto was cooked too fast. Rice was hard on inside but overall mushy. Dish was swimming in broth. As well, $10 for valet was a bit pricey. Much prefer Chinato who cooks entrees to perfection! Chinato validates parking so it isn't as expensive. Don't waste your time at this Bruell restaurant."}
{"text":"My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her whitefish entree. My soup and salad was typical, nothing special. My sister was underwhelmed with her veal.   Unfortunately service was not good.  Never asked if we wanted a second cocktail and our entrees seemed to take twice as long as the neighboring tables.  Perhaps three women are typically thought to be poor tippers, so they receive poor service.  Well, we received poor service, and tipped accordingly."}
{"text":"Boar dish was poorly prepared, I miss took a pearl onion for a small potato, the red wine in the sauce wasn't reduced right and didn't pair well with the boar, there were mashed sweet potatoes on the bottom but wasn't mentioned in the description. The duck paprikash wasn't much better, the duck had a gritty texture and the sauce wasn't prepared correctly either, onions were over cooked and slimy. No speztle in sight. No one bothered to refill my soda even though it sat empty for half the meal, I would of asked for a refill but our server took our drink orders, brought us drinks and briefly asked us if we liked our food before we ever took a bite before disappearing and everyone else kept quickly running around. Never again will I come here"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fantastic dinner at Cowell & Hubbard before the Book of Mormon at the Playhouse. The service was literally as good as it gets. I called the day of to get a reservation and the girl who took my call was able to get us a seat ( even though they were booked for the night).   The food was exceptional. We started off with the Mushroom Bisque and the tomato gazpacho. Very fresh and the perfect amount for a starter. I had the whole roasted chicken and my date had the duck. Both dishes were excellent.  The kitchen did a fantastic job spreading out the service so we didn't feel rushed yet we had plenty of time until the show started.  The servers were some of the best I've had.    I can't recommend Cowell & Hubbard enough for any occasion especially before a show at the Playhouse.  I do recommend calling a few days ahead to get a reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere: cozy and romantic without being pretentious. The bread with olive oil and salt is heavenly, I'm always tempted to ask for more but don't want to get too full before the amazing entrees!   The bar is great for a cocktail before a show at playhouse.   Only complaint is that I wish they would change the menu more often. They tend to keep their \"seasonal\" items on the menu for like 9 months...which doesn't really feel seasonal anymore!"}
{"text":"Had dinner before seeing a stomp.  The service and food were outstanding as my water glass was always full as was my bread plate. I ordered the Orange fairy drink which I would recommend it you like licorice and I had a portobello steak which was served on fresh green beans and fingering potatoes.  Ended with meringue cookies with salted caramel ice cream in between them.  While it was different and delicious it was difficult to eat."}
{"text":"Very good meal after play.  Amazing rabbit dish.   Service : great! Pork stack appetizer unique and good.  Thai seafood soup was disappointed. Noodles stuck together and soup just very bland.   Strip steak entree:  proper medium rare and overall good.   Torn Pasta entree:  this is hidden under the noodles section and contains rabbit. Amazing dish and nothing similar anywhere!  Unique and delicious light sauce with pot pie type pasta and greens. A very memorable dish!!!"}
{"text":"We went last night before a play.  The service was amazing, and the food was great.  I could make a dinner out of the vegtables.  Don't miss the parsnips."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Zack Bruell's C&H three times so far, and all three meals have been exceptional. Seafood is prominent on the menu, and the two things we've tried were all excellently prepared and very fresh. The place also works wonders with lamb and beef. C&H is more \"New American\" than the designated \"French.\" If you want French, Bruell's L'Albatros in University Circle is a better bet. The interior is spacious, dimly but adequately lit, and classy, with a contemporary minimalist feel. It has the \"bones\" of the old jewelry store of the same name that once occupied the space in the heyday of Euclid Avenue as a retail street. C&H is, in my opinion, one of the very best restaurants in Cleveland. I haven't tried all of the most highly rated downtown restaurants, but I have to think that this one compares with the best of them. If you're going to a play at the nearby theaters, this is my pick for where to eat before or after the show. The servers are friendly, knowledgeable (or cheerful about finding out if they don't know the answer to a question), and highly professional."}
{"text":"This used to be a good restaurant. It is now an experiment in odd combinations. I knew I was in trouble when the Manhattan came festooned with foam. \"A Manhattan is stirred,\" I said to the waiter, who looked as though he had never tried one. He kindly replaced it. The salad began with good, fresh ingredients--heirloom cherry tomatoes, arugula,  and burrata--but the thing was drenched in cooked, pickled purple onions: the taste of the pickling brine lingers on my palate 12 hours later. The entree is my new standard for ill advised combinations,  replacing peanut butter and tuna: salmon and broccoli. I can just hear someone proclaiming \"let's combine only HEALTHY ingredients.\" I don't think the chef eats his own cooking. This odd combination came in a broth into which were dipped halved fingerling potatoes. I was worried about them being mushy, but they were cooked so hard that they were impermeable. The whole mess was inedible."}
{"text":"This restaurant made me wish that I loved in Cleveland. We had the braised beef shoulder with Dauphinoise potatoes, the half chicken with portabello mushrooms and the red fish in a light cumin infused cream sauce. It was remarkable and our server was the best of the best."}
{"text":"First visit for a work lunch, though I'm familiar with Bruell's other restaurants...  Lunch on 6/27 with a colleague... reservation for Noon.  Promptly seated at a somewhat-cramped booth in an otherwise empty space (which filled-up quickly with the business lunch gang).  Because we were in the bar-area, the bartender was our server.  Prompt, attentive service without hovering... here's a group that understands how to get people in and out in an hour.  Good stuff.  My colleague went with the braised beef shoulder, served \"pot-roast style\" with carrots and other veggies.  He seemed pleased with the selection.  I went with an app of butternut squash ravioli and the Romaine salad, served together with the colleague's entree.     All of our plates echoed the selections at Chinato (a good thing, trust me)... colleague's braised beef was a bit lighter than the Chinato fare... no polenta (understandably for summer and a French influence).  Words can't describe the ravioli... rich with a lemony-butter sauce, with Swiss Chard, yet light enough for lunch.  The Romaine salad seems simple on the menu, but had a fantastic Anchovy vinaigrette and a nice dusting of bread crumbs.  Delectable.  Two great meals for $45.00 out-the-door.  Bottom line... Bruell does it again.  Without tater tot gimmicks or frozen Sysco food.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Uninspired and surprisingly unprofessional. We were a table of 7 with one waiter, cold entrees and missing orders. The sommelier was no where to be found and left the well meaning young waiter on his own. Uncomfortable at best and disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Kate was amazing and the food was fabulous!! Latin braised pork was OMG - OMG ... Seriously!"}
{"text":"Spent a few hours sippin' whiskies and eating some apps in Zack Bruell's new joint. Located in PlayhouseSquare, this place in perfect for dinner before or after a show. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. Be sure to try the Seafood Dumplings and the Roasted Pepper, my favorite. A great spot with a relaxed attitude and great food."}
{"text":"Had a lovely time celebrating valentines day at the Cowell & Hubbard. Started off with the butternut squash ravioli which had so many flavors I could not stop indulging in it. Dinner was delicious with the braised beef shoulder, it was so tender, and savory. My boyfriend enjoyed the burger immensely and the frites were crispy, and flavorful. The baked apple filled with mascarpone was a wonderful way to end our absolutely delicious meal at Cowell & Hubbard.  We both definitely will be back again to enjoy more of this fantastic menu."}
{"text":"Zack Bruell does it again, adding yet another crown jewel to the burgeoning Cleveland fine-dining scene. My wife and I celebrated Valentine's Day here, happily engaging in the deadly sin of gluttony. The result of our piggishness is plenty of dishes for you to read about below.  The list of appetizers was impressive, and we could have happily ordered ten of them and called it a night. Instead, we settled on four, all of which were expertly executed and delectable:  1. Mussels Provencal - The combination of plump, fresh mussels and savory olives is a must-have for any mussel-lover.  There was no grit at all, the olives were not briny, and all the flavors were well balanced.  Superbly executed.  2. Chicken Wings - These wings have dethroned Greenhouse Tavern's wings as my favorite in Cleveland. The unique combination of goat cheese and tomato dust in the \"wing sauce\" created a Moroccan-style flavor that took these perfectly fried wings to the next level.  3. Beef Ceviche - A great blend of high-quality beef ceviche and diced fruits and vegetables. The crispness of the fruits and veggies was a nice counterpoint to the soft texture of the beef. If I had to find fault, I would say that the beef could have used a touch more acid, but that is a minor quibble.  4. \"Bacon and Eggs\" - This pairing of perfectly cooked pork belly and an airy, creamy frittata was one of the single best dishes I've ever had. Each component would have been outstanding on its own; in concert, they were stunning. Do not fail to order this.  We then moved on to salads.  Unfortunately, this course was a mixed bag:  1. Haricot Vert Salad - This was great.  A perfect composition of green beans, blue cheese, tomatoes, and pickled onions with a balsamic vinaigrette. Clean, delicious flavors. Highly recommended.  2. Belgian Endive Salad - This salad was confusing. The blend of celery root, marcona almonds, and cheese was quite successful. But the endive was so overwhelmingly bitter, and combining that with an excess of truffle oil did not help matters. Perhaps some sweetness or acid could have helped to balance the dish, but I really think that there was no overcoming the bitterness -- it was simply too assertive. There was also a bit of endive core in the salad, which is a no-no. Hopefully, they can fine-tune this dish, as it has a lot of potential.  Our bellies already full, we moved onto entrees. Both were very good, though mine fell short just a bit:  1. Crispy Giant Pork Shank - This was my entree. The kale on which the shank rested was heavenly, having absorbed all of the great flavors. The generous helping of thyme dumplings scattered throughout the plate were very tasty.  The only flaw was with the star of the dish --while the pork fell off the bone nicely, it was a bit dry in some parts. However, the parts that were cooked properly were moist and bursting in flavor. If they can master the cookery on the pork, this would be a masterpiece, and I would not hesitate to recommend it. Even with the dryness, I would still recommend trying your luck with this dish -- it's hearty and perfect for the winter.  2. Pacific Rock Fish - This was my wife's entree.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  It was not quite as spiced as my wife and I expected, but it did not suffer for it. The fish had a nice coating of \"tomato crumbs\" (dehydrated tomato) and sat in a yummy pool of tomato-basil butter. The broccoli rabe and spinach were also cooked very well.  We cut short our entrees to save room for dessert. To end the night in true gluttonous fashion, we ordered three desserts:  1. Dark Chocolate Ice Cream - Nothing fancy, just three scoops of some insanely perfect Mitchell's ice cream. So damn good.  2. Meringues - This sort of looked like a burger constructed of meringue buns and a burnt-caramel ice cream patty in between. These meringues are not like the soft meringue that you'd find on top of Key Lime Pie -- they were more like crispy biscuits with a texture akin to astronaut ice cream. They tasted great -- how could egg and sugar not -- but you should know what you are ordering. The ice cream here was also excellent.  3. Peanut Butter and Jelly Cheesecake - This was also yummy. The density of the cheesecake was a little off-putting at first, but I soon stopped caring once I began stuffing my face with it. Perfectly flavored -- not as overpowering as you might expect. Worth a try if you are a cheesecake fan.    While our overall experience at Cowell & Hubbard was not quite perfect, it was still stellar, especially considering that it had only been open about a week at the time. It's a gorgeous, tastefully modern space. The staff was very attentive; our server Loretta was enthusiastic, and the manager frequently visited to gather feedback and make recommendations. I have no doubt that any flaws will be worked out soon, and I look forward to dining there before every visit to Playhouse Square. A good value for the quality (and quantity) of food. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is the new restaurant by that old guy who owns L'Albatross and Little Caesars.  My first squabble with this place is that my parents picked me up from a great afternoon of drinking at Shooters and they had a pair of khakis in the car.  I was having a great time at Shooters but I promised them that I would get dinner with them and I mean it's obviously very nice of them to pick up a very drunk me at Shooters and then take me out to a nice dinner.  So I was wearing a nice v-neck and some nice khaki shorts at Shooters and my parents want me to put on khaki pants instead of shorts for this place.  Alright, fuck it I'll do it because I love my parents and I want my mother to be happy.  So I change into pants in the back of my dad's rental car and it is a miserable changing experience and I just do not want to be wearing khakis; even though I looked damn good in them.  My mother explained to me that this was a nice place and shorts were not acceptable for a Saturday night dinner.  Ok so we park and we walk up to the restaurant and there is like some 50 year old dude wearing a fucking Polo and motherfucking cargo shorts walking in.  I just deal my mom an icy stare of doom.  Whatever it's all good I still love her.  We get inside, get some Moscato or something, I dunno it was pretty good.  Got the squash ravioli for an appetizer it was absolutely delicious.  Golden trout was an entree which was cooked great and just the right texture but lacking in flavor from the very copious amount of seasoning that was apparently on it.  Luckily there is some very nice rock salt available at the table.  My mother had duck breast which was served rare and she didn't like that so I traded her half of my fish for her duck breast.  It was very chewy, but I'm not really an expert on how rare duck should taste.  I kind of liked it.  Decent meal not nearly as good as I remember L'Albatross to be."}
{"text":"You see \"French\", you know you're paying the price for top quality food, at least historically, and here you get what you pay for.    Superb wings as an appetizer; great mushroom bisque soup, though a bit flour-y for my tastes.  My dining partner reported the fish was as fresh as could be and, like every Bruell restaurant, there was no scrimping on the bread supply, which is refreshing for such a 5-star destination.  Another departure: the waiter actually suggested a cheaper Tempranillo not on the wine list, saying they were considering adding it.  At $26/per, I'd vote yea.  Cowell & Hubbard shows The Cleve as the happening place it can be."}
{"text":"Dined here before a night at the theater, Bruell has created a stunning space and a menu that you must pause to enjoy.  The mussels appetizer was delicious, tomatoes, olives, yum.  Service was attentive and courteous.  The pacific rock fish was delicious; mild, tender, and on a bed of spinach and dumplings."}
{"text":"This is the first negative review I have ever bothered to write and post. The service at this restaurant was so atrocious my party and I couldn't let it slide.  The food was ok. Nothing to rave about. My torn pasta had more bones in it than meat, unfortunately. The bone marrow was nice and rich. The restaurant itself is dark, loud and modern.  As for the service, we arrived for dinner, ordered our first round of drinks and appetizers and the manager came right over and asked us if we were driving or taking a taxi. We said taxi, since we were from out of town, and asked if they could call us one, so it would arrive when we were done.  With our main, some of us ordered another drink, and some of us were not even drinking. We ordered dessert and when someone wanted another drink, the waitress said she couldn't serve us because she was liable if we were driving. Very nasty, how she said it, too. Especially considering they already called us a taxi. And there was no one making a scene or being inappropriate at the table. We paid and left before our dessert even came. The manager tried to be helpful, but we have never been so insulted at a restaurant. Completely unwarranted. I wouldn't bother going here unless you plan on sticking with water."}
{"text":"Zero stars. We have been here before and liked it. Not this time.  Went during restaurant week. Salads were ++ gritty....not washed. The main course appeared right after the salads.  The servers were not good. One of them tried to clear a dessert plate when the person at our table was actually eating it !!  Will not come back for a while, maybe never. Too bad."}
{"text":"We keep going back....After attempting to find new places to eat in the Playhouse Square area, we continue to return to Cowell & Hubbard.  This time we both had the salmon that was cooked perfectly, translucent in the center. We have had this previously, and it always melts in your mouth.  We each had a glass of their Sancerre and finished our meal with selections from the cheese board.  We are thrilled that they added the cheese service this past year, and enjoyed our tastings. Service was just right, not overbearing, and the noise level was more than  acceptable. Management is always attentive and ensured that the experience met our needs."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here before a show on Saturday night.  They asked right away if we were going to a show and said they would make sure we were on time.  The \"tag team\" service was excellent.  One person gave us specials, another person took our orders, and another person brought our food and checked on us.  We ordered the hangar steak (cooked perfectly) and the braised beef shoulder (tender and delicious).  We didn't think we had time for dessert, but the server told us which were the two fastest and we were able to have dessert and get out on time.  (The only reason I did not do a 5 star review is because of the bartender after the show.  We stopped for drinks with another couple.  We practically had to beg for drinks.  He was not friendly or nice.  My friend spilled her (full) glass of wine and he stood the empty glass up and never offered to bring her another one.  We got the impression we were bothering him so we left.  Will not go back to the bar after a show."}
{"text":"Food was very good, just not excellent. Flavors were good just seemed that the dishes were a little watery, that is, sauces didn't coat a spoon but ran off. Olive oil for bread seemed a little rancid.  Tap water had a musty odor.  Service was excellent, Dominic."}
{"text":"Two words: SALAD BINGE. Now, I know that may not be the sexiest combination of words that can be thrown at a restaurant, but before you go, \"ugg, let's scroll past this dieting freak\", hear me out. Cleveland, and the Midwest in general, is not known for being kind to green things you can't fry. Leafy things are normally served with a sneer out here, or served on the side of something meaty and manly as a wilting afterthought. But there is an upside to the redonkulously huge menu here, and that is a long list of interesting and different salads, plated in substantial portions and whisked out to you quickly. And the salads are darn good. So after sampling most of the menu and going, \"ehhh, hit or miss\", I've nestled into the welcoming bosom of their salad section. I occasionally come here when I need to remind myself leaves are edible again.    As a bit of a sidebar, I have a bone to pick with Zack Bruell. Out of all the chefs who could conceivably brand themselves, Zack is a head-scratcher, because he seems to have no signature cooking style. Dude, get a style, ANY style, and stick to it. Please. Because your giant schizophrenic menus give me a headache and wonder what's the worth of a celebrity chef when there's no one signature flavor or dish. The menu at Cowell and Hubbard is the worst offender. Most Chinese takeout places would look at this menu and go, \"okay, you don't need to have a billion specials\".   When I first was handed the menu here I assumed it was the wine list, because it was so long. And there's Asian dishes, French dishes, Italian dishes; you name it it's probably on there. The drawback to this is that meals lack consistency and never feel like something the chef is dying to cook, instead feel like dishes by paint-by-number, that also lack authenticity. I will commend the cooks, for how massive the tome you can order from, a large percentage of the food is darn tasty. But if I'm paying this much for food I want a point of view coming from the kitchen. Also, this generic-ness bubbles over into the design of the restaurant. While Cowell and Hubbard is a handsome large space, it feels a bit bland, like the interior of a wine bar in an airport terminal.     So what's a gal to do with a menu that is so morbidly obese it needs a gastric bypass STAT? Well, take advantage of the fact that instead of one compulsory salad, this place has eight. I've shamelessly sidled up to the bar here and ordered five salads, and they come speeding out, to be stacked in front of me like green jewels. And the salads are everything you want in a salad: more than just leaves to substantiate the plate, zesty zippy dressings, perfect salting and or lemon juice pops, and large sizes to fill you up.   Current menu offerings include the julienne apple, carrot and radish salad with blue cheese, creamy horseradish and walnuts ($9) (fresh, pretty and crunchy). There's a frisee and pork croquette salad with smoked paprika aioli ($9) (take on a classic French salad, porkis the star here and done well). Also there's a quinoa salad with arugula, peppers, squash and raspberry vinaigrette ($8) (a tad bit boring but very virtuous tasting). Also you can choose a beet salad with feta and white balsalmic ($11) (a classic for a reason). My two current favorites are the caramelized fennel and arugula salad with goat cheese, marconna almonds and raspberry vinaigrette ($10) and the artichoke salad with frisee, radicchio and caper berries ($10). There's even more salads, but I think you get the point.   As for, you know, the rest of the menu, it can be hit and miss. I've had a braised rabbit pasta with homemade noodles that was tasty. I've also had fish that tasted old, and paired poorly with some sour cabbage slaw. I've had a dessert of a strawberry napoleon with caramelized pastry sheets, vanilla cream and balsamic glaze. While pretty to photograph, it was awkward to eat (the layers shattered and went everywhere when attacked with a fork).   Why, ultimately, is this my salad joint? For Cleveland, this place gives you some of the most variety you can get in one place, ups the salad flavors to new and interesting heights, and whisks the salads out especially fast. As for a fine dining romantic meal, you can have far better elsewhere downtown, but Cowell and Hubbard is inoffensive."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this a 5* rating is because the waitress was incredibly rude. Like, she hated life and my sister and I didn't stand a chance. She really ruined the whole experience :( Anyway, the food - CRAYZEEE good!  Salads were great, the stuffed peppers and their stuffed cabbage were out of this world. We got a bunch of sides too (kale, mushrooms) just fantastic. Great atmosphere and really, such exceptional food."}
{"text":"Delicious French Bistro in PlayHouse Square- the finest fare you'll find in this district. I love the radicchio salad and the scallops entree. The menu is in English, staff is exceptional, and they have a decent wine list. On show nights they have valet. They accept reservations through open table so it's definitely a great spot!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the positive reviews for this restaurant. It seemed very much Amateur Hour to us this evening. Maybe just a bad night. Service was indifferent; went long stretches without any sight of the wait staff, even though it was early and not busy. No one smiled, except the trainee server. In fact, they all seemed as if they would rather be somewhere else. Perhaps they were attempting to affect a haughty French demeanor? Most were dressed in a borderline slovenly fashion. Overall the ambiance was the opposite of upscale contemporary; more like minimalist diner. Food was meh. Not much actual meat in the meat dishes. Won't be back. And won't be doing the Tour De Bruell again. Too much variation in the quality of the restaurants. We would have been better off just going to L'Albatros six times. Oh, one more thing: when we sat down, we asked the server (not the trainee) to stamp our Tour cards, and he asked, \"Do you want me to do that now, or wait until the end of the meal?\" Did he think we were going to grab our stamped cards and run out without ordering an entree? Really? Just not a classy place."}
{"text":"Our meal was wonderful.   The Morrican lamb was succulent as was the beef Bourgogne.   Service by Jos√© was spot on, attentive without   being cloying.  We will return"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, we had reservations for 7:30pm. It wasn't very busy when we got there, but filled up as the night went on.  After we were sat, someone immediately took our drink orders and we were provided with unlimited bread throughout the evening. Someone walks around and fills your bread plate as needed. With olive oil and a small bowl of pink salt.  We started off with dirty martinis, one vodka and one gin. Both made very well.  For appetizer we had the Seafood Dumplings (tiny little dumplings in a lobster sauce with pickled cabbage $11).  We ordered one appetizer and they split it up into two dishes, which was probably a good thing because this was so delicious I probably would have eaten the entire thing myself, not sharing with my boyfriend. The lobster sauce reminded me of a lobster bisque, it was very rich, so splitting it in two was perfect size.  For dinner we ordered the Spicy Bouillabaisse (clams, mussels, calamari, scallops and cod $26) and the Seafood Risotto (scallops, shrimp, calamari and chorizo $22). Both dishes were really delicious. The seafood - a lot of it- was perfectly cooked in both dishes.   The bouillabaisse had so much flavor, you couldn't help but take all that bread and sop up the yummy broth. Even after you knew you had already ate too much. Same with the risotto, so many perfectly cooked flavors in this dish.   For desert we ordered the Butterscotch Creme Caramel ($7). This was almost like a custard or creme brulee. It was by far the best part of the meal, so delectable.  We shared one, but could have easily eaten one all by myself (even after a full meal and appetizer). It was just that good.  The food portions are decent sized, neither one of us could eat all of our food in one setting. That's okay though because it meant I could relive this delicious dinner the next day.  The service was great. Everyone was really nice and attentive. Overall the price (approx $90 -not including tip) wasn't too bad considering how much we ate, we expected it to be higher.  I am so glad I was finally able to try this place, it has been on my to do list for quite some time.  I will definitely be coming back here again...soon!"}
{"text":"Food was great!  Dinner at 4:30 after a show at playhouse square. Felt like we got \"the bums rush\".  Service disappointing."}
{"text":"Northeast Ohio can get cold and windy and make ordering delivery that much easier but even if it hits sub-zero weather, Cowell and Hubbard is worth the trip.  The restaurant was originally a jewelry shop back in the early to mid 1900's and while they have revamped the interior into a modern vibe it still holds some of the old school style and flair. They have 4 tables that are actually inside what used to be the vault room.  The servers are incredibly kind and knowledgable about the menu, the city, and willing to engage in colorful conversations (should your dinner guests not be entertaining enough).  Their Vegan offerings, in particular, are top notch. The Tournedos of Seitan is the second best Vegan dish in Cleveland but only because the Stuffed Cabbage they make here is clearly #1.  Perfect place to dine before checking out a performance in Playhouse Square or celebrating a rare Browns victory in style.  There are two outdoor lots that have parking for $5 within 2 blocks and several parking garages $10-15 within a 7 minute walk and valet is available!"}
{"text":"Left my private function at Cowell & Hubbard last night to have a drink and food at the bar.  The decor here is pretty bland, but at least it won't look dated quickly.  I had a phenomenal cocktail - pretty and pink, cold and refreshing, tart and not too sweet (but pricey at $12).  I was totally planning to look it up today so I could recommend it, but alas, the menu online is different from the menu they had at the bar last night, and it's not there.  I probably would have given 4 stars if it weren't for this.  I had the bahn mi with frites.  I cannot think of a time or place where I've had better fries!  The sandwich on the other hand, was just ok.  This was my first bahn mi, so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it was messy and less flavorful than I would have expected based on the ingredients.  The service was prompt and efficient, but decidedly unfriendly.  I was in no hurry to visit any other Zack Bruell restaurants after a disappointing experience at Chinato, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised at Cowell & Hubbard.  I would not hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"We went before a show to have dinner and were blown away by the amazing service and delicious food! I suffer from a great many food allergies and they were super accommodating. They had fresh baked bread, made in house, and grilled up some gluten free bread for me. My mother had the tomato soup and said it was the best tomato soup of her life. My cod was soft, fluffy, and perfectly cooked and accompanied by perfectly cooked vegetables. They have many gluten free and vegan/vegetarian options! The staff was very attentive, constantly refilling water, tidying up the table, and checking in on us. I'm not sure if we got so much attention because of my allergies, or if that is how everyone is treated, but it may be one of my new favorite Cleveland restaurants!"}
{"text":"Outstanding venue on Playhouse Square!  Start with the lighting and ambiance, very inviting and comfortable.  Service was very attentive and no detail was missed.  Water glasses were kept full (much appreciated) and no shortage of flavorful bread to snack on.  Timing for each course was perfect.  Each member of our party tried something different and all were great. The salads and the lobster bisque were very good starters.  Seafood entrees were expertly prepared and presented.  The dessert was sized just right and finished off a perfect meal and visit.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Right in the Playhouse Square Theatre district, the place is going to kill it!  Another fine Zack Bruell spot featuring modern French cuisine in a historic space.  My wife and I went before a recent CPH show, during Cleveland Independent Restaurant week.  We decided to stick with the Prix Fixe menu available, so we could sample a number of different dishes (our favorite way to eat!).  Our starter course consisted of a wonderful salad and a hearty / rustic tomato soup.  Both had a lovely presentation and the flavors were unique and delicious.  On to the main courses!  Wife chose the blackened cod fillet and I chose the glazed pork tenderloin.  Again, beautiful and artful presentations of the dishes with flavors to match. Cod was blackened perfectly set atop vegetables with a surrounding sauce. My pork was grilled to a medium rare with a smokey sauce drizzled on top.served on top of wilted greens.  Finally, dessert...she chose the raspberry torte and I selected the hazelnut cheesecake.  The torte was cobbler-like with a crisp crust and tart berries and served ala mode style.  My cheesecake had the look of a flan with a delicous graham cracker crust.  The meal was fantastic, service attentive and the server quite knowledgeable about every dish and even the building and its history.  Will most definitely consider for future before-Playhouse meals."}
{"text":"We visited Cowell & Hubbard for the first time last night and we were very pleased as we usually are with Zack Bruell's restaurants.   We arrived a bit early for our 7:45 reservation and they seated us very quickly which was nice. Our table was great because we could watch the open kitchen where Chef Bruell was busy expediting.   For starters, we enjoyed the seafood dumplings and pork stack which both paired nicely with our bottle of wine. Both apps were unique, tasty and enough for a meal. The dumplings were not typical stuffed dumplings. I don't even think there were wrappers so the dish was lighter than you expect. Very good!  The pork was amazing too.   We moved on to entrees where I had the duck breast and my husband had the beef cheeks. Again, both were fab. The duck was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin. The curry sauce was so delicious with it, yet not overpowering. The braised beef was equally good.   We had to pass on dessert because we were so full. Maybe next time and there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"Came here after a Sunday 630 performance of BOM.  Where to go on a Sunday night, after the theater, in downtown Cleveland?  We walked by at about 915, and the sign said they closed at 8, but there were folks, lots of folks, still eating.  So we popped our heads in and they said \"come-on-in!\"  So we did.  They are trying to build up their theater trade and were more than hospitable.  They had a special theater small plate menu, and of course a full bar.  The menu was varied enough; so there was something for each of our four top.  We had eight dishes, 4 drinks, and left about 10:30.    Great environment, attentive servers and management.  We left satisfied and happy.  Wish them luck on catering to the theater by making a visit!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Zach Bruell fan and I really wanted to enjoy Cowell & Hubbard.  The food, however, left more to be desired.  The decor is really chill and relaxed and the service was very good.  I went there on a week night but the place was still really busy, so they're clearly not having trouble in the revenue department.  Though it is a new spot so it could just be leftover opening hype.    I ordered the Chicken Thighs with celery root puree, blue cheese croquette and Tabasco butter--kind of a reconstructed take on chicken wings.  The chicken was slightly overcooked and the blue cheese croquette completely overpowered the dish.  The celery root puree was actually quite good, but the blue cheese flavor destroyed any sense of balance in the dish. I also ordered the steamed spinach side dish, which was fine.   I don't think I'll be back, though I could be convinced otherwise.  With so many great restaurants downtown, including Bruell's excellent Chinato, it would be hard to decide to give Cowell & Hubbard another try."}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  Love the dimly lit interior.  Big space.  And a big menu.., that surprised me.  I opted for the burger upon hearing it was grass-fed beef.  The creamy blanket of raclette and paprika caramelized onions was the shizzz.....such a killer delicious burger.  I substituted roasted carrots for fries... Great choice.  Delicious.  My friend got the Trout like she always does and she raved about it.  The team service concept is a nice idea but at times the service felt clumsy because we were asked twice for our drink orders.  The upside is the service is attentive.  Food came out fast... Date I say a bit too fast.  Valet is a must in that area.  Can't wait to go back and explore other options like Beef Ceviche!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. Thought the space was gorgeous, the food was delicious and our wait staff was excellent. With that said, the host/hostess staff left a lot to be desired. They are the first faces you see when you walk in, they should be welcoming you with a smile and kind greeting. Instead we got blank stares and attitude. No one said anything to us until I offered up that we had a reservation. Even after that there was still no greeting. They led us wordlessly to the very back of the restaurant to a room that seems to be reserved for private parties. On this night it seemed reserved for us (early 30s) and the geriatric crowd. It was really weird where they chose to sit us. I think our experience would have been better if we were out with the younger lively crowd.   We had the goat cheese croquette appetizer, beef cheeks and the pacific rock fish, followed by the flourless chocolate cake. Everything was delicious and top notch. The staff helped us pick a wonderful bottle of wine and were extremely attentive and professional. I just hope they better train their host staff in customer service, it really leaves a bad first impression."}
{"text":"This is so close to the theaters, they are used to the theater crowd and will accommodate you if you are short on time before your show.  The atmosphere is interesting and I would say has a good, hip vibe.  It was probably filled with a bunch of sad people hoping to talk to their deceased loved ones when we were here (Theresa Caputo was in town) but you couldn't tell.   We ordered two seafood appetizers and those were absolutely. top. of. the. world. delicious!!  Like amazing, make your taste buds tango flavors!    While we waited (what seemed like FOREVER) for our flatbread pizzas, a young man never, ever, not even for a second, let my husband's bread dish remain empty.  This was so, so brilliant.    The pizzas were eh, really.  I wouldn't come back for them.  Dessert was good, again not really amazing.  This was a treat and a great date but not a total culinary tour of excellence.  The seafood saved the day."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Poor service, poor food. We had listened to the server at the table next to ours list the specials and were confused when our server did not include two of the items. When we called her on it she made TWO excuses: 1. She had just arrived for her shift and wasn't fully briefed on the specials and 2. There where only 4 servings of the french onion soup left and only two of the soft shell crab sandwich left. So which is it? A server was allowed to start her shift uninformed or she didn't feel like offering us items that were short in the kitchen? Either way that's not how a restaurant of this caliber (and expense) should treat its customers. Also I asked for lemon with my water. She forgot. In the mean time I saw other servers bringing water with lemon without being requested.  The food. So disappointing. I asked for a dinner salad with balsamic. My salad was clear. When I told her I wanted balsamic she took my salad back eventually returning to say it had WHITE balsamic and that the kitchen was \"going downstairs to get balsamic for me.\" Dark balsamic is traditional. If you're going to serve white balsamic you say something to the customer first. When the salad finally came it was soaking in balsamic and barely edible. Was the kitchen having fun at my expense?  I asked the server what was the size of the cod portion. She responded 8 ounces so I ordered it. When it arrived everyone at my table agreed that it could barely have been 6. In addition it was overcooked and way too salty.   Cowell and Hubbard has \"jumped the shark.\" It may have been one of Cleveland's finest once upon a time but no longer. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A great French restaurant without a crushing price tag. I have yet to be disappointed with anything Cowell and Hubbard has to offer. The service has been prompt without being intrusive and exceedingly nice. I spilt a wine of wine on one occasion and the staff showed up immediately with a fresh glass of wine (that I was not charged for) and quickly cleaned everything up."}
{"text":"Don't even think about coming here for dinner on a Friday night if you don't have a reservation!  Unless you're ok to sit at the bar, because that's all that will be available.  We were fine to sit at the bar, as it was our mistake that we didn't make a reservation, but changed our plans from full dinner to appetizers and drinks.  We took advantage of the happy hour specials, which were...ok.  Not sure what their house wine is, but I wasn't blown away.  The chardonnay was too sweet and sour at the same time - weird, huh?  The husband had the Great Lakes Christmas Ale, which was fabulous!  Probably the highlight of our little meal.  The pizza was pretty good - I think it was a margarita type?  Husband had the mushroom sandwich, which sadly was not a winner for us.  Cute place, though."}
{"text":"Our expectations were high and were met.  My wife and I started with soups, butternut squash and the chicken noodle.  Both excellent.  I was torn between the lamb breast and the whitefish.  The waiter steered me to the whitefish...good choice.  Risotto and spinach was the perfect complement to the whitefish.  My wife went with the scallops and she enjoyed them.  For dessert we opted to share the peanut butter and jelly cheesecake.  Crustless, it was peanut butter glob with a liquid grape jam poured atop.  I say this in a good way.  Very unique.  Service was excellent.  Ted was personable, not stiff.  We had 6pm reservations on a busy Friday night, sat promptly, and had plenty of time, even with dessert, to make the 730 show at playhouse square.  We will be back for sure, but still want to try the other 2 zack bruell restaurants we have not made it to yet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to finally splurge a little bit for a date night a couple of Saturdays ago. When we walked inside, the hostess was extremely friendly and sat us near the front of the restaurant in an intimate booth. She immediately gave us water, bread, and oil. Our waiter, Anthony, greeted us and was extremely polite and personable. We started off with soup, I got the tomato bisque and he got french onion and both were great. For entrees, I got the parmesan chicken breast and he got the beef shoulder. The chicken was tasty and the sauce was as well. The chicken, pasta, and spinach was all plated on top of each other in the almost bowl like plate, so the juice was on everything. It was good, I just wish there was a little less juice and more of a thicker sauce that accompanied the pasta. His beer shoulder was very tender and the mashed potatoes were perfect as well. Leaving this restaurant I will remember the cozy, intimate ambiance and the incredibly friendly staff that made sure we had bread and water at all times :)"}
{"text":"My tuna tar tar salad was great but a bit small for an entree salad."}
{"text":"There are plenty of better options downtown. This place isn't worth the price or the hype.   The strangest thing was how far off the menu listings were from the dishes delivered. Why write misleading descriptions in your menu? The host admitted to us that my dish wasn't very well described in the menu. Well maybe you should fix that then.   Service was meh. Interior was nice. Beer lost was pretty good."}
{"text":"Had reservations before a show. Got the seat by the window we wanted. Staff was courteous and friendly. We loved the bread that was brought to the table so the lady handing out the bread kept bringing us more. She was nice. Our server was very nice and complimented our dinner choices. She prob does that with everyone. The meal was delicious. Had the fried chicken. It doesn't look like a lot but it filled me up. My companion ate the short ribs. That was a big hit too. We split a dessert. Nice time. I'd go back."}
{"text":"A friend and I had dinner at  Cowell & Hubbard on a rainy February evening.  The experience was positive from the first greeting.  I did something quirky and ordered the Peruvian Lima Beans (listed as a side) as an appetizer.  Turns out others have been doing this also.  I never knew Limas could be so good.  I wanted to drink the broth from the cute little casserole dish it came in.  I ordered the stuffed pepper provencal from the vegan menu & found it to have a nice  balance of heat & savory.  The wine menu--especially wines by the glass-were great.  A good range of options and fairly decent pricing. Service was also great.  Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Five of us went to C & H for V-day dinner, of course the ambient was set up for one romantic night, with rose petals on the aisle and smooth medium lighting to provide that soothing ambient. We took awhile to order due to amazingly great menu. For appetizer, we ordered Fois Gras Donut topped with orange gastrique sauce. This is a must-get, the donut is so juicy inside, perfect combination with the sauce. Now moving on to the main entree, we ordered:   APPETIZER  FOIS GRAS \"DONUTS\" Three donuts filled with natural juices of duck liver and served on top of orange gastrique sauce!!   ENTREES:  1. CRISPY GIANT PORK SHANK Upon the arrival of the plate, you can smell that lingering \"pork fat\" smell that just increases your appetite level up a notch. What's perfect about it is hearing the searing of the knife against the crispy skin of the shank. The shank is so tender, however I felt the kale and thyme dumplings lacking flavor.   2. BEEF CHEEKS I have never tried beef cheeks before, so I was initially curious to the texture and consistency of the meat. Cheeks served on top of a bed of sweet caramelized onions soup, and topped with mexican salsa peppers. If you have never tried cheeks, this is right time to try it. I LOVE THIS DISH!  3. RED FISH As a visitor from California, I have tried many best seafood restaurant in California. Let me say this dish definitely brings the rating -1 star, due to lack of seasonings and tastes very BLAND. We felt so bad that we asked for more garlic salt and pepper. However, the waiter did not manage to ressurect the problem by offering a new dish to compensate the lack of quality on this dish. I highly do NOT recommend this dish at all.   4. LAMB BREAST This dish deserves 5 stars. Amazingly done Lamb Breast, also included some portion of lamb fat. This dish is the highlight of our night, so tender and perfect.   5. BRAISED BEEF SHOULDER Amazingly done once again, beef shoulder braised to perfection and filled with its natural juices really makes this dish feel healthy and light.   SERVICE:  We were given 2 pieces of french bread, olive oil, and himalayan salt per person. However, they progressive only gave us a total of 5 pieces of bread that night, ODDLY shaped french bread (like the ends of french bread). I kept telling myself that this is sort of fine dining, but how could you give out your diners bread end curmbs??    OVERALL: I enjoyed the experience and food. If I am going back to Ohio, I will definitely try the Beef Cheeks, Crispy Pork Shank, and the Lamb Breast. The other two dishes that I got were not that statisfactory, aka, I can get them somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very nice looking restaurant kind of a fancy place. Although, food didn't match up with its nice decor. I came with a group of 4 and none of us were very big fans of what we ordered. :/"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Amazing service and attention to detail. Loved the lavender honey ice cream"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. We hadn't been in a few years and the food and service has really gone down hill. I was really looking forward to the dinner and am a fan of Bruell, but our experience was bad. First, it took us forever to be greeted at our table and have a drink order taken, the drinks we ordered were poorly made, the server almost seemed to forget we were there as he consistently would walk by us or just ignore our table completely. The menu selection was much better last time we visited the restaurant. There was nothing special about this menu. Last time we visited we had a great experience, so I was very surprised that this time was so bad. As far as the food goes, what we ordered was tasty (the crispy pork app, chicken and mushroom flatbread, and pork shoulder), but the debacle at the beginning combined with the poor service and average menu options will cause me to not return. In all fairness, the restaurant knew that it was a bad experience and comped part of our meal without our request, so they did at least try to make up for their pitfalls."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 4 pm and were seated at 4:01. The staff was absolutely amazing. We ordered a bottle of white wine and they made sure it was kept cold for us and also made sure our glasses were never empty. The appetizers were surprisingly good, considering they were the frog legs. While not something I would normally order I was so glad I did. The main course kept the bar high and still didn't disappoint. We both ordered a fish entree and it was cooked to perfection. The desserts are just as good as well. The Paris Brest (pronounced breast) was amazing and it only got better with the addition of the French press coffee. I have very high standards when I pay more than 15 bucks for an entree and this place not only met them head on but blew me away from start to finish. If you are in Cleveland and you miss this place you have truly missed a wonderful opportunity to have a great time."}
{"text":"A great choice for a cocktail and app or a full meal before or after seeing a show @ playhouse square.  Staff is efficient, knowledgeable.  Excellent cocktails, menu. Need to keep returning to try all the delicious food on the menu.  Salmon tartare is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love that this place is on East 13th!  The restaurant has a slight contemporary feel with modern lines and traditional bar.  It has a fairly large layout with the tables a bit more spread out than at some of other Bruell restaurants.  There are slight pops of color through the restaurant. The best part is that this restaurant was not overly packed like many of the other restaurants downtown, as the crowd depends on the shows at the theater a bit more than some of the other area restaurants. You can actually breath and enjoy your meal without worrying about others waiting for a table!   The service was friendly and relatively quick.  I ordered an Aviation, an Ian's Manhattan and a Bacon Man.  The Aviation was delicious with the lemon providing a nice zest to break up the heavy Woodford Reserve.  The Ian's Manhattan was slightly heavy on the gin, but it still had a nice smoothness to the whole drink. The Bacon Man smelled a little too much like rancid bacon for my taste, which is unfortunate since it was a great concept (bacon and maple infusion)- perhaps poor execution.  The appetizers were really tasty- we order Foie Gras Donuts and seafood dumplings.  The foie gras donuts are warm, crispy outer shell and sweet with a savory inner of foie gras.  The foie gras was room temperature while the dough surrounding the foie gras nugget was a luke warm; it was a bit heavy for an appetizer so the foie gras to dough ratio is a little off (more dough than foie gras). I would have appreciated more foie gras and less donut.  The $18.00 price tag on the 3 donuts warranted a little more foie gras in the donut.  The seafood dumplings were a hit with plenty little bites of shrimp/lobster in a relatively light sauce.    I also got a plain Romaine Wedge Salad was that good, but a it was bit heavy with the crust and vinaigrette, which defeated the lightness of the salad.   For entrees we got the Red Fish, Seared Salmon and Breaded Veal Pillard:   The red fish was awesome with a nice crispy brown sear on the outside with soft, moist, flaky inner.  The fish was seasoned nicely, not overwhelming, but just enough to bring out the light flavor of it.  The creamed cauliflower hits the spot without as much guilt as I would have with mashed potatoes.  The dish overall is tasty, but a bit heavy with out some very much light vegetables to break it apart (its topped with few grated carrots).    The salmon is your basic salmon, nothing too amazing.  The sides were a bit boring for my taste buds- sauteed spinach with miso rice.  It reminds me a bit of an elevated Miso Salmon from Cheesecake Factory.  The breaded veal pillard was SOO SOO SOO good, can I emphasize how good?  The pairing with the side was perfect with a nice light salad to help cut some of the heaviness in the breaded veal.  The veal is tender, pounded to the perfect 1/4 in thickness that gives it a great mouth feel. The baby artichoke salad give it a light sour kick that you would get with a lemon in wiener schnitzel.    My whole bill including the 3 drinks, 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 salad and a side of fries came out to $90.00.  It's not too bad- about average for this caliber for this restaurant.  I will definitely get the veal and the red fish again; I cant wait to try their other dishes and have room for dessert.  3.75-4 stars for 2 tasty entrees, few good drinks and prompt service; it didn't get the full 5 stars because of the small amount of foie gras in the appetizer, boring salmon and bad Bacon Man."}
{"text":"Nice place, very swanky:) I only got a small taste of this fine establishments' eats and drinks while we were at a Yelp event there, but it was very nice, very clean and the wait staff was very attentive.  Also, not sure about parking, but it is in the Theater District, so I'm going to guess that parking is most likely only available at some of the local garages.   All in all, for the brevity of my experience, it was nice."}
{"text":"Razzle me Dazzle me, Bruell and Dombrowski never fail!  These are a few of my favorite things :)              -The space is beautiful and open.  You can see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen while having a intimate dinner for two.                -The full staff is knowledgable about the menu.  From appetizer to dessert the waiters to front of the house are proud to show their menu.                -Although pricey, this restaurant is open 7 days a week to meet your dining out desires.  It is clear here that you get what you pay for and this place is worth EVERY penny.                -I am always weary about extensive menus.  The first thought that came to my mind about this place was \"jack of all trades\".  After I had my first meal there, I was sold.  This menu showcases different talents of the chefs and it is very clear when you order.               -It is important when coming here because the menu is so diverse, to let your server know what you are looking for in your meal.  As long as that is clear, you will have a fantastic time!               -One of my favorite dishes is the seafood dumplings.  The sous chef, Jonathan hold New Orleans near and dear to his heart, and with this dish you can tell!  It reminds me of seafood gnocci in a delicate cream sauce.  Plus the nice touch of saurkraut and generous portion made a midwestern girl like me very happy!!"}
{"text":"Jeannene and I always get here once during each theater season because the food's always fantastic but we got a little nervous last Saturday when we sat down and they said they had just instituted their fall menu -literally less than an hour earlier. Did the staff have time to work the bugs out? (ouch, in appropriate reference, sorry).  And when we ordered our cocktails the waiter had to take a quick look at my menu to see exactly what I ordered. But from then on it was smooth sailing. The drinks had an autumn quality to them as my rye drink included a nice smokey honey to it. And for appetizers we split the seafood dumplings with cabbage and lobster sauce ($11). The appetizer was served in a way that I had only seen done at Lola's -- instead of serving it in the usual dish and then letting us split it up on our side plates, we were each given a composed dish with half the amount of food. Very thoughtful! And the food was very unctuous with light bites of seafood in a sauce surprisingly full of spice. For one of the very rare times, I did not get seafood for the main course at a Zack Bruell restaurant -- instead going with the beef shoulder that was very tender over a sweet potato mash ($23). The hearty meal had a vinegary kale to go with it and a watercress pesto. The perfect rustic dinner for fall. Jeannene had a $24 Boar Bourguignon (Hey, I only had to check 3 times to make sure I spelled it right... no, I wasn't talking about \"boar\") I loved the taste she gave me -- it evoked the same heartiness as my dish -- but she thought the sauce at the bottom of the bowl was too salty. For dessert we split a nice cheesecake -- again we were each give our own composed dish of half portions. And again we loved it as it was just a nice light bite after a big meal and with various sweet notes."}
{"text":"As you can see I don't submit many reviews, it takes a really bad experience (or continued poor ones)or a really great one for me to post something. Don't be fooled by the menu on line-  that has some interesting and unique items on it that drove us to go to Cowell and Hubbard, its over a year old and only a few items remain. My sales team always tests out a place before we use it for business. I eat out and entertain customers from all over the country 2-3 times per week. I would never take a customer here. Boring food, bland flavors, another Zack Bruell failure. Chinato is the best of the bunch but that's a stretch, Alley Cat is terrible. Table 45 is nothing more than institutionalized hospital food in a hotel. Its too bad this guy takes up so much space in Cleveland when there are so many other great places to drink, dine, and entertain. Service was exemplary and the staff was very friendly, but it wasn't enough to make up for the total disappointment."}
{"text":"The bone marrow app is absolutely to die for, and the staff was super-friendly and welcoming.  I'd definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! I got the special, which was a ramen bowl with white fish, mussels, hard boiled egg and tons of veggies. The flavor was unreal! I could drink the broth. I also had some of the duck my boyfriend ordered it had so much intense flavor and the portion was huge! It look like at least a half duck! Great portion sizes all around... left very full and happy! Drinks were great too! Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"For what this restaurant was supposed to be we as a group were disappointed, going there before the theater. We got there early as 5:30 for a 6:00 reservation and were parked in the bar, which was no problem great drinks and excellent draft beer selection. Finally got moved to a table and ordered then got our soups and salad they were all good and tasty, waited for our diner which showed up at 7:00, all the meals were luke warm at best, flounder and lamb food but nothing special, the pork shank diner thought the meat was dry and  had issues for the rest of the night , the red fish was mediocre. I am EZ but not that ez, will not return."}
{"text":"Came here on a date with the bf, and we really enjoyed our time here. It's located down the street from Playhouse Square and it's a great thing to happen to the downtown Cleveland area. I love hearing about all these new restos popping up near the Gateway and Theatre districts!  The ambiance here is super chill. It's well decorated -- love the red and the white. We had a reservation, so we got a booth right up front. (Saturday nights -- busy!)  The servers were very, very attentive and very consistent with the Bruell restaurant line. We never lacked bread and our glasses were never half full of water. Our server was really knowledgeable/opinionated, and we went off of his recommendations. Great job!   The flavors were similar to the other Bruell restaurants I've tried (L'Albatros and Parallax). His food is typically creamy with a certain flavor that I can't put my finger on. I wouldn't be able to tell what the difference between L'Albatros and Cowell and Hubbard were, and I think I may like L'Albatros more... we'll see. My bf thought Cowell and Hubbard was a little more upscale, and he enjoyed the food here more.  We ordered:  Seafood dumplings: 5. These were really fresh, creamy, and were just so indulgent.  Romaine salad: 4.5. Gotta get some greens in there. According to our server, the fact that they serve half a head of romaine means that they get it in fresh every day. We definitely got half a head of romaine, which was very shareable b/t my bf and I. The flavor was really great - loved the anchovy-fennel dressing and the crunchy bread crumbs. The presentation wasn't as flattering though. That, and it was a little on the pricy side for half a head of romaine.  Tofu au Poivre: 4. Apparently, the head chef is really well-versed and specializes in vegan cuisine! This made me feel at ease -- usually vegan/vegetarian food is an afterthought. The tofu was delicious -- seared perfectly with a great consistency. It almost has the same consistency as chicken. However, I found the dish to be a little salty and a little bitter -- there was a little bit too much broccoli rabe. It was pretty filling and I had to take the rest home.  My bf got one of the fish dishes. I think he enjoyed it overall; Bruell does seafood really, really well. I tasted the sauce and it was pretty good.   One thing that bothered me was that with the trendy + modern space and open kitchen, they were still playing TVs at the bar, which caused a man at the table next to us to become demanding when they wouldn't show the OSU game over the Notre Dame game. (Yikes.)  I think it's a great restaurant and I would definitely consider taking my foodie brother here next time he's in town."}
{"text":"After trying almost all the nice restaurants in the Cleveland area, we had to give this newer restaurant a try as well and see if it's up to par with all the other ones. And just as we had hoped, this place did not disappoint!  For appetizers, I think it deserves a FIVE star! We ordered 2 appetizers - A stuffed pepper and a beef ceviche. Although you see these 2 dishes in many different restaurants, but the way they paired the 2 dishes with varies ingredients are just amazing! If you like spicy food, the stuffed pepper would be a good choice. And the beef ceviche, you can't even tell it's raw!  For the entrees, it deserves a 3.75 star. The reason being is that the Flounder fish we got was a little bit below expectation. Although the waitress said it'll be something that we've ever tasted in this world, it didn't shock anyone. The taste was good and feels like a healthy dish, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. As for the whole roasted chicken dish, I would say that's much closer to having a out of this world taste than the flounder! The sweet and savory taste is amazing! And I loveeee the crunchy and tasty skin! Although the white meat was a little bit dry, but the dark meat makes everything worth it! I appreciate the fact it comes out with a side of veggies, but it was a little bit too creamy for my liking.   Last, but not least, the dessert was ABSOLUTELY amazing! We tried the Meringues, which looked like a big white macaroon. The dessert is nothing like what we expected, and it melts in your mouth! And yes, the dessert deserves a 5 as well!  Oh, one more thing, their drinks are very interesting as well. The pear drink was surprisingly sour! Very interesting drinks there too. Overall, we were very happy with the restaurant. And would love to go back and try some other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Cowell & Hubbard is one of those places you can't go all the time, but sometimes you want to splurge. My friend and I were having a nice night out on the town, going to see the Opera, so we decided to class up our dinner as well and go all out. We arrived pretty early, but the wait staff was already prepared. They immediately knew that we were going to the Opera right after, a little touch that did not go unnoticed. They seated us and took our wine order and proceeded to give us bread and olive oil (plates that never were empty).   We got the beef marrow and salad as starters. While I didn't try the salad, the beef marrow was delicious and had just a touch of orange zest in it that truly made the dish. For my entree, I had the skate wing over quinoa. That quinoa was, and I am not exaggerating, the best quinoa I have ever eaten. It was red quinoa, a variety that I don't believe I've ever eaten, tossed with diced vegetables and it was so buttery and delicious. The skate was flaky and crispy, truly decadent.   There are only two negative things I could say about all of this: with everything I had that night, it may have been too rich (however, I blame that more on myself than anything else) and my friend may have outdone me. She got the braised lamb shoulder with sweet potato mash and with the first bite, you immediately felt at home. It reminded her of so many wonderful memories and that lamb shoulder alone sparked some great conversation.  For dessert, we had a beautiful chocolate cake and coffee. It was sublime to say the least.  The decor of the restaurant was nice, however it was a little gloomy. When I went to the bathroom in the middle of the meal, I had to walk back along a corridor which was very dark, seeing as it was both dusk and they hadn't turned on the overhead lights. However, that is so minimal to the entire experience, I was not affected at all. The wait staff was very attentive and I don't remember once having to look around for our waitress.   All in all, it was an experience that I hope to repeat should I ever find myself in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Went here with a small group before a play. They use a \"team\" approach to servers, so service is brisk and attentive. The wine by the glass selection is excellent and they have a very good white Burgandy. The restuarant has a nice style to it with Red being a dominant theme, and while the sound level was a bit high, it was not overpowering, and conveyed a nice sense of energy. We had a mushroom pizza as an appetizer and I had the \"Playhouse\" Burger, very good with \"Frites\". Others at our table had the trout and salmon, pronouncing both as excellent. I will definately be back and would like to check out their bar area as it seemed lively as well."}
{"text":"I was here a few years ago for lunch.  And I said I'd be back for dinner and tonight was that night!  I tried the romaine salad (sooo good. Whatever dressing and olives and shaved Parmesan cheese you guys use, keep using those ingredients in everything.....amazing!) Also had the bone marrow as my entree.  Smaller and not as \"meaty\" as I've had at other venues but still good.   I had a refreshing citrusy grapefruit cocktail to wash that down.  It tasted like a liquid lemon drop.    My dining companion had the potato soup and the quinoa-crusted trout.  Now *this* was one helluva delicious dish.  Served with wilted greens and these amazing mashed potatoes, I think this was the shining star of dinner.   For dessert we shared the cheesecake with a berry compote on top, and the peach tart.  Both were realllllly good.    Service was top notch.   It's no wonder this was formerly a jewelry store, because Cowell and Hubbard is a true gem in the Cleveland dining scene.  Can't wait to try more of Zack Bruell's restaurants.  If I'm not mistaken, he was a 2016 James Beard nominee for \"Best Chef\" in the Great Lakes region.   We are seriously spoiled in northeast Ohio with all the amazing food."}
{"text":"We came in on 6/15/16 and our server was Dan; he was just great! We were having dinner before a show and he made us feel welcomed and not rushed at all! He also answered our questions and gave us suggestions (which a lot of servers are hesitant to do for some reason). Actually the manager (?) swooped in to take our order which did make us feel a little hurried. My husband had the playhouse burger and even though the meat was more well done then we asked, it was still delicious. Whatever magic they work with the raclette is dreamy (well all the melty cheeses are, right?). I had the pasta Carbonara and it was so great. I was warned that it had a more soupy texture and I didn't mind a bit. I practically licked the bowl clean to get every last drop. We had goat cheese ravioli and the seafood dumplings. They were good, but nothing extraordinary. We had prosecco for dessert, so a great way to end the meal. They keep it on ice for you which is nice and I haven't noticed at other restaurants."}
{"text":"I find myself in Cleveland a lot now for work and always on the lookout for reasonably priced but good restaurants.  C&H fits the bill.  I was pleasantly surprised when my waitress came over, poured some olive oil into a dish, placed some bread on a plate, and gave me a menu--all without saying a single word!  Such a relief not to listen to endless introductions, life stories, tales of restaurant greatness--when all you want to do is sit down and enjoy a meal.  Her name (which I found after I got my bill) is Amy. The meal was very good.  I just had the strip steak with a bottle of Duvel beer but the steak was properly prepared and the accompaniments were good as well.  I was disappointed that the pork shank was no longer on the menu as the Yelp picture made it look very attractive.  I'll definitely be coming back for another visit!"}
{"text":"Well...disappointing. We saw others review this place and thought we would give it a try. The atmosphere was nice but we were sat in the back room and it was about 80 degrees. The tables were so close together and there was no music so we felt awkward to even talk. Our server was not good. We felt beyond rushed. We were going to a play after but we planned accordingly and had two and a half hours to relax and have a nice dinner. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered. At certain places that's a good thing...not at what is framed to be a nice fine dining restaurant. Our server spoke very loudly (again in a small room). He was pretty tacky - making bad jokes and barely able to make suggestions about the menu or wine. We waited longer for our plates to be cleared and our check than we did for our food.  The food was bland and very over priced in our opinion. My husband had the trout and I had the beef shoulder. Neither was very good. My beef was swimming in a tasteless broth with spinach and roasted tomatoes. It was tender but not flavorful. The trout tasted like nothing. The mashed potatoes were good but with two dinners and two drinks we spent over $80 including the tip.  With as many options as Cleveland has now, I'm not sure they'll be able to compete. They are probably busy because of the close proximity to the theaters. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try come check out Cowell and Hubbard after returning to Cleveland after a few months on a Friday night. Restaurant was pretty empty, but seating was cozy and ambiance was pleasant.  After glancing over the menu, we decided to go with an appetizer sampling to enjoy some variety. Overall, the portion size was enormous! Four appetizers and a salad was an overwhelming amount of food.   The Russian salad successfully paid homage to one of my favorites while appropriately elevating it to be fine-dining worthy. Unfortunately the first course was the best. The theme at Cowell and Hubbard seemed to be taking already heavy dishes and lacing them to be almost inedible. The pork belly, shrimp dumplings and polenta were overly enhanced with cream and butter, compromising the formerly distinct elements. I longed for an acidic element to break the monotony.... but it never came.  Long story short- Cowell and Hubbard failed to break the mold in serving cuisine challenging traditional Midwestern taste buds."}
{"text":"Beef shoulder was amazing! We tried the cod, the heirloom tomato salad, lime shrimp salad, salmon, and veggie tempura for appetizer. Everything was  especially delicious. The beef shoulder was serious comfort food- so good!! All of the ingredients are locally sourced if possible, which is a nice touch. We got a few mixed drinks as well and they were also fantastic - great flavors! The waitress knew the food and drink menu well, and was able to give us good recommendations. We had a wonderful experience.  I cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner after hearing Zack Bruell opened up another restaurant. Being this is my first Zack Bruell restaurant, I was a bit disappointed. The service was great but it was the food that I gave this place a 3 star. I ordered their popular appetizer butternut squash ravioli but found it to be too salty for me. The squash had its consistency but it would've been better if it was edible. That was truly a downer. Next comes my main entree which was the flounder. Overcooked, tasted fishy, and too much butter. I've had flounder elsewhere and to pay a dish over $20, I'd expect the fish to be more light or melt in your mouth but it wasn't like that. It came with rice which tasted really heavy considering it was mounted with tons of butter. There was no siro suace it describes from their menu.   My friends ordered their beef shoulder, pork shank, and beef cheeks. For appetizers, mussels  were ordered which were exceptional. It had plenty of wine in its sauce. The meat were plentiful and cooked perfect. The beef was tender for all the entrees my friends had. The only complaint was that the spinach or greens from the pork shank dish was again very salty.   The decor is modern and the place had a full bar. I would give this place another chance but would not be anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to dining at Cowell & Hubbard since it opened.  I finally had the chance to dine there, this evening.  Overall the service was great and the food was well prepared, just perhaps not my cup of tea.  I didn't enjoy this restaurant as much as  other Zack Bruell restaurants..  We started with the chicken wings with goat cheese, tomato dust and chicken bacon and also the porkbelly and sundried tomato frittata.  Both were expertly prepared and presented, just way too much going on, for my taste.  For my entree, I chose the lamb breast over couscous.  It was just ok, probably would not order again.  For dessert, I had the Blondie with vanilla bean ice cream, which was very good, but didn't taste like a traditional Blondie. Good experience, but just not for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Phoenix and we got ticket so see a show. We wanted a place that we could walk to prior to the play starting. We found this restaurant and we loved it! It is the closest restaurant to what I call the secret parking lot that you only have to pay $5 to see a show for and one of the only restaurants that won't cost you an arm and a leg. We tried a couple things and split. Everything was good. I was skeptical, but we took our waiter's advice for desert and got this macaron with ice cream. I have never seen this before and it was absolutely delicious!! If I could have ordered 20 more I would have! The sea salt ice cream it was paired with was insane! I would say we found our secret dinner spot, especially if going to the theater!!"}
{"text":"fantastic. Went there before a show at playhouse. The scallops were great and wine selection was good."}
{"text":"Who says the French couldn't go vegan?! Zach Bruell proves them wrong. It's been weeks since I ate there, but my mouth still starts to salivate when I think of the stuffed tofu entree. Simply divine! And the service was exceptional to boot! The staff was extremely knowledgable about the menu and the chef was even able to accomodate a non-traditional vegan dessert (beyond their standard sorbet). Truly a wonderful experience with trendy atmosphere that didn't come off as stuffy. Great spot to stop in before or after a show in the theatre district."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to have date night near playhouse square and decided to try Cowell. We got there at 7:15 and the lovely hostess greeted us and showed us to our table where she gave us water, bread, and oil. Our waiter, Tony, was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered the tomato bisque and he ordered French onion, both were tasty. For our entrees, I got the Parmesan chicken breast and he got the beef shoulder. My chicken was good, but there was a little too much Demi for my liking. Everything got lost in the thin sauce that was dressed on the plate. My boyfriends beef was perfectly tender and his potatoes were great as well. Leaving this restaurant I will definitely remember the intimate ambiance and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Birthday Dinner but will be added to my Top Favs as long as I Watch My Check! Best for adults as the menu is more refined and for the older palette!  My teen ordered the Bianco Pizza... excellent flavors, but for $16, you should most definitely get more than a personal pan size not more than 6-7\"... that is shameful at best!  The Brussel Sprout salad with sweet white raisins, serrano ham dust, shishitos, a few slivered onions and 1 or 2 candied walnut (pieces) was full of flavors but it would have been nice to see more of these items I list and not just the brussels...  The Quinoa crusted Trout was flavor abound!!!! Nice beans and a rather decent slaw provided a lovely meal.... the nicest trout I have ordered out in a while.  The Salmon was prepared with precision, however, a larger piece or less fingerlings would have presented better.  It looks like a plate of potatoes to me... IJS...  Lastly, the sweet tooth!  We could not decide between two ...the Meringues and the Apple Cheesecake... it was my birthday so I was able to win the decision... the spiced apple cheesecake sitting sweetly on an apple butter anglaise with a lil candle...nice!     Then the other we DISCUSSED came out...the Meringues... yes both could not have had a better flavor...BUT, the waitress, Kate brought both AND charged us for both when we only ordered the one! I could see if one was a birthday dessert from C & H, but no... they brought both and charged us for both...HOW TACKY!  Seriously... TACKY and UNPROFESSIONAL...I am truly SMH...I would have said something but my family would not let me... SERIOUSLY, KATE????"}
{"text":"Hate to leave a bad review.  The service was good - they asked if we were going to the theatre,  were prompt with drinks and food, were very friendly (both our server and the manager), and replaced one bad dish and didn't charge for a second bad dish.  But that's the problem - 2 dishes so bad they weren't eaten, the burger and appetizers were eaten but not good.  Good service = 2 stars, but poor food left a bad taste in the mouth."}
{"text":"Special occasion restaurant   Nice location in downtown  phenomenal chicken breast  not jazzed about menu options  cheese board was overwhelming  no plans to return but would"}
{"text":"Located in Cleveland's historic (and newly redecorated) theater district, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Here's the drill: book an evening show in playhouse square along with reservations for this foodie marvel, leave car with the valet, and simultaneously solve parking, dinner and an easy way out of the district. Do specify to the server that you are watching a show so they are aware. I also recommend a good 1.5-2hours to show up at this place before the show.  This is a great place to bring a group. It is one of Zack Bruell's restaurants that feature new-american dishes with a heavy French influence as opposed to the more traditional-leaning french served in L'Albatross (another favorite). There might be some mild Asian fusion going on, but not to the extent Table 45 does it.  I recommend a close look at the cocktail menu, and for everything else, think pork, of which THE dish for me is crispy pork shank, served on a bed of collard greens, on an acidic reduction to balance things out. Much like that pig face of Greenhouse Tavern, you might need (a) that cocktail or a shot of schnapps to help melt the thing in your stomach, LOL and (b) a person to share it with. If you don't want to kill your arteries, they do excel in the fish department.  Enjoy your dinner, cocktail and the show!"}
{"text":"Cowell & Hubbard is a newer corner situated, near Cleveland Public Square Theatre area modernist fine dining.  The open airy feel with segregated seating sections what are open within but separated from the others exude the feel of dining in chick pods of sorts.   The bar area to the right has seating and to the left of the reception desk are more usual dining seating.  The further back you go the more cozy and intimate the feel becomes.   C&H has an open kitchen in the back, so if you want to be close to action and the delicious smells asked for a seat in the rear. My visit brought me here for having lunch with a great friend.  The  ambiance and attention from the wait staff are well balanced for being served well and having conversation.  This is a great place for lunch and dinner.  The menu is diverse offering something interesting for every palette.  The Butternut Squash Soup, my starter, was delicious down to the last spoon full.  The soup is not overpoweringly sweet nor too far diluted with broth.  The creamy and herb garnish adds a touch more of thickness and flavor to an already top notch soup.   This will be definitely a repeat item for me here.    The Risotto with Lima Beans and Shrimp, served to my friend, of which I got to have a few bites to taste,  contained perfectly tempered risotto (likely in aromatics and thick broth) then mixed with steamed beans and cooked further with pink shrimp.  The combination was mouth watering and made me wish I had ordered the dish for myself.    The Beef Cheeks - my choice of entree, seemed to have been marinated and then cooked in red-wine reduction sauce and came with dauphinoise potatoes, onions, peppers, mushroom, and olive garnished with light greens.  Beef Cheeks typically very lean, easily separated with the fork and combined with the potato made a great pairing.  It would have been better if it wasn't  a little too sweet for my taste.  I however, enjoyed every bite.     The menu has many other items I would love to try and I'm positive I will return to try more and have some of the delicious goodness they are serving up in this joint."}
{"text":"Nice modern decor. Good variety on menu. Prices in line with other Zach restaurants, which I find fair.   Had 3 apps, all very good.  For dinner, just hamburger and frittes... was just in the mood, but was very good.  Drinks were on point as well.  Staff was courteous and helpful.    Overall, very good impression."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I attended here shortly after I proposed. Even though we arrived 20 minutes past their normal seating hours, they were very accommodating and did not rush us at all. Champagne was on the house.  The noise level was slightly more than I was expecting though it wasn't a loud restaurant by any means. The food was excellent. We ordered the gravlax and blini as an appetizer, followed by two entrees---trout with pine nuts and pomegranates, and braised beef with carrots and dauphinoise potatoes. My fiancee and I LOVED the appetizer. The trout wasn't overly flavorful but my fiancee enjoyed it anyway. The beef, however, was perfect---juicy and tender. For dessert we had the mocha pot de creme---also highly recommended.  We appreciate Cowell and Hubbard making this past Sunday such a wonderful evening for us.  We hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I thought that the food was good (I got the pumpkin-crusted trout), however for the amount I payed I would've liked a larger quantity. I was still kind of hungry when we left."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this restaurant.... We heard so much and was really excited to try it out on our special date night out. We could only get reservations at 4pm for dinner so we thought wow, it must a fantastic place!!   First off, before we could order anything, the bread served was not warm and we found a strand of hair in the olive oil..... Big uh-oh.  Next, we ordered escargots as an appetizer. The escargots were bland and portion was smaller than expected.   The servers came asking for our orders 5-6 times before we were ready and we felt like we were being rushed to get out so they could prepare our table for the next diner.  Valet parking costs $10, be warned!  Also another warning: Restaurant week 3 course meal menu is extremely limited, not a good representative of what this restaurant has to offer"}
{"text":"Quality of food is 5-Star worthy, no question.   We went to C&H last night for the second time and it was even better than we remembered. Tried the Latin Brazed Pork and the Duck Paprikash and would definitely recommend either of them.  Pork was served as a stew with beans and some vegetables - great flavor from the seasoning and the meat itself. Paprikash was typical Paprikash - just with duck.   For a Saturday night the restaurant was pretty slow - must have either missed the pre-show rush, or there wasn't anything going on at Playhouse Square."}
{"text":"Had the rabbit gnocci.  Good overall, but a little too brothy and salty for me.  Bread service was great.  Nice wine selection.  Would try the restaurant again, if I had to go to Cleveland again in the future for some reason."}
{"text":"I love Cowell & Hubbard; great menu & good portions. I wish that I would get more than 1 tiny piece of bread without asking for another though.  Great quick service before the theatre. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great chance to enjoy food out of the ordinary without being \"too\" crazy for those not used to it  great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service - thank you Jose! Daughter is vegan and they had great options. My son  loves all food and had the escargot and duck both delicious. I had steak which was very tender.  Deserts were awesome. Attention to detail makes it worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch at the bar at Cowell & Hubbard.  The design of the restaurant is impressive--very clean layout and its spaciousness is highlighted by the incredibly high ceiling.  The bar was set for 17 and probably could have fit double that (but thankfully did not).  There were plenty of open tables for lunch, and except for one more diner towards the end, I was the only person at the bar.  The time between walking in and getting the bill back to sign took 39 minutes.  The Thai Chicken and Noodle Soup was surprisingly mild, with the flavor driven more by the cilantro followed by the deeper flavor of the shiitake mushrooms, which I really enjoyed though some may not like the rubbery texture.  There was also a small chicken bone in my cup of soup, which was a little disappointing when the expectation is top-notch execution.  The Banh Mi could have easily been renamed \"Cilantro Sandwich.\"  It was absolutely loaded with cilantro, which paired well enough with the pickled vegetables and mayo, but wholly lost is the duck pate and prosciutto.  The sandwich comes with a load of seasoned fries which were overcooked--though I actually somewhat enjoyed the pronounced crunchiness for a change.  I really feel Zack Bruell and Cowell & Hubbard can do better, and I may have simply fallen on the wrong part of the menu for my first visit--I would not recommend either of the items I had (in fact, to put it more strongly, I would particularly discourage folks from getting the Banh Mi).  I look forward to updating this review some time with a visit for dinner."}
{"text":"My my my, this is a sexy little place to spend an evening!  Whether is a big group of friends enjoying drinks and a delicious meal, or a quiet evening for two - this place is perfect for what you're looking for.    And the food - THE FOOD.  They have truly gotten into their groove.  I've been several times now, and each time is better than the last.    Apps that are a must:  Chicken Wings w/ Goat Cheese, Tomato Dust and Chicken Bacon  - Yes, wings are messy and hard to eat, but these little treats are worth every napkin wipe.    Bacon & Eggs - this 'play on words' appetizer is one of the better things I've ever had - ever. Pork Belly w/ a delicious sun dried tomato fritatta. Put a little but of each on the fork, and the flavors blend so well and just melt - it's truly amazing.    I'm still figuring out the Salads/Entree portion - everything has been good, but nothing to scream about.  The Lamb was delicious, the Salmon is great, Thyme dumplings are interesting, but I must say that the fries that come along w/ the burger (ate a lot of my dining companion's plate) are killer!  They are thyme fries with some sort of cajun salt mixture served with ketchup that has a slight hint of cherry.  Wow - I couldn't stop snacking.   Dessert:  I came here with a bunch of ladies the first time, and we sampled nearly every dessert on the menu, and my favorite would have to be the Peanut butter and Jelly Cheesecake.  This dessert is incredibly decadent while feeling light and playful.  Perfect way to end the meal.    I'll put this out there, though it's a bold statement.  This MAY be my favorite Zach Bruell restaurant! From the ambiance, to the food, to the service, to the drinks,  to the private vault party room - this place is truly a dining experience you won't forget."}
{"text":"Just not there yet... we had the foie gras donuts which worked way better in theory than reality. and then the red fish and chicken livers. nothing was bad, that's for sure, but nothing felt like it was great well thought out food. which is what i'm looking for... Also not in love with the interior but that's not a reason to lose stars. just saying..."}
{"text":"Went here for a work Happy Hour event. Nice little place, seems appropriate for the professional/money makers crowd, so I felt a little out of place in just my business casual clothes (and snow boots because the night we went there was pretty much a blizzard going on outside). I got the Crispy Chicken Thigh Sandwich which was pretty tasty and so was the glass of Moscato I had. Only downside would be that they never announced that Happy Hour was ending to our group so when a couple of us tried to order drinks 2 minutes after we were turned down."}
{"text":"Loved it! This just jumped into my top 3 in Cleveland.  Went here for a date with my boyfriend last weekend and we had a great time.  We called to make a last minute reservation Saturday afternoon for dinner that night, and although they were understandably booked, the hostess was so friendly and managed to squeeze us in anyway.  This was the first indicator of the great service we had all night.    Decor is clean, modern, classy, and lively.  The service was unmatched.  Our server was so friendly and helpful with real suggestions and recommendations, and never made us feel rushed or overly bothered as we checked out the huge menu.  The food was consistently great, and at reasonable prices too.  We shared the beef ceviche appetizer which was delicious and refreshing.  For entrees, we ordered both the Lamb Breast and the Breaded Veal Paillard.  Both were perfect- full of flavor, paired nicely, and generous portions.  This menu is big, which I normally don't like but from what I've seen so far, it didn't affect the quality one bit.    We're looking forward to coming back the next chance we get."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner before a show at Playhouse Square. Good location, nice that you can use OpenTable to make reservations.  The appetizers are amazing, including the crabcakes.  Nice selection of salads, and they will divide one for all of your party to share.  Entrees were good, but not as unique.  Desserts were good as well.  Nice wine list, full bar.  Service was attentive.  Excellent choice if you are going to the theatre, and for other occasions as well."}
{"text":"Third time back at Cowell & Hubbard. This time I came with 7 other friends and tried a ton more dishes than the other 2 times. Highlights: mussels appetizer, lamb breast entree, lingini with squid sauce, and meringes desserts are my favorites! Anyways, here goes the full review of my 3rd meal here:  Appetizers: Bone Marrow (3): sad. third time trying bone marrow ever, and I wish Bruell didn't cut the bone in half. It made it easier to grab the marrow out, but i feel like it lost the authenticity of it. In addition, the bone marrow wasn't as salty or as flavorful as the one I had back in Paris. But, on a good note, glad to know a restauratn in cleveland has bone marrow and there was a ton of meat/fat in it! :D   Butternut Squash (4): got this a second time, and it had a lot more sauce than the first time we had it. also wasn't as delicious as we remembered, but still worth it!  Mussels (5): wow. the sauce that Chef Bruell adds in this mussels are just amazing!!!!   Entrees: Roasted Whole Chicken (4.5): WHOA! so tender and it sure was an entire chicken! This dish was so filling and the sides were perfect. The side (portabello mushroom and potatoes) came in this mini crockpot and it was so cute. either way, the chicken was great! And still just as good after microwaving  Risotto with shrimp (5): YUM YUM YUM. If you like big shrimps and risotto, get this! The risotto had a ton of flavors and it was very very delicious right the right texture. The shrimps were soooooooo good and they were like JUMBO SHRIMP!   Giant Pork Shank (4): this pork shank wasn't as big as the first time I came here with a friend. Thoguth the first time, it was bigger. Regardless, the flavors were still there! WOOT WOOT!   Chicken Livers (3): tasted like mini fried chicken tenders. Flavors were great but the dish was a bit bland.. it needed more pairings or flavors."}
{"text":"So my review is based mainly on the excellent staff... I came to the restaurant for the first time for a drug rep dinner for my work.  The food was excellent (salmon, med salad), but it was a set menu so I'll have to explore more options next time I come around.  More importantly in my opinion is that one of my colleagues had a completely flat tire when she rolled up to the valet service.  The valet service knew we were part of this drug rep group, found out who owned the car with the flat tired and offered to change the tire.  She actually had a malfunctioning trunk and they were still able to get in and change her tire.  Then the server came by to notify her that the spare wasn't properly inflated and she needed to get air before attempting to drive home on the highway.  They were so helpful and truly concerned that she had a safe ride home.  Very impressed by the staff and planning on coming back on my own accord in the future."}
{"text":"We were entertaining important guests from the Bay Area who were eager to see the best of downtown Cleveland and were looked forward to experiencing Zack Bruell's downtown restaurant.  The meal did not disappoint -- gorgeous flavors in the beef and lamb shoulders and fish specials, a wonderful goat cheese ravioli, and attentive and friendly waiters.   The evening -- and the sophisticated impression the restaurant otherwise conveyed -- was ruined by the hostess who greeted us and checked in throughout the evening.  A 20-something, she made a point of addressing the male and female members of our party -- well-dressed 50-somethings --  as \"sweetie\" \"dearie\" and \"sweets.\"  Our guests played along but were clearly incredulous that a top-rated restaurant server would speak to guests in this way.  Even after I smilingly suggested \"Give it a rest!\" she persisted.  Later, when I asked directions to the ladies room, she walked me back and said, \"There it is -- sweets!\"  Having had enough, I quietly approached her and explained that her form of address was condescending, and suggested perhaps she had mistaken us for senior citizens.  Her reply -- that \"some females take offense to the names I use -- sweets\" told me all I needed to know about the standards of service at this restaurant.  We'll take the $300 we spent on dinner elsewhere and won't be back -- a shame that an otherwise truly wonderful meal, and our visitors' experience of Cleveland, was marred by such thoughtless and untrained behavior."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of Zack Bruell's since trying L'Albatros last summer and taking a \"tour\" throughout all his restaurants. At Parallax, the final stop of our tour before Cowell and Hubbard opened, I had the pleasure of meeting Bruell and he only made me an even bigger fan of himself and his restaurants.   My boyfriend surprised me with reservations to celebrate a belated Valentine's holiday. While we did have a fairly early reservation, 5:30, the place was already filling up by the time we came in. As expected, Zack's streamlined decor that shares a common thread in all his restaurants was found here, but I enjoyed the glow of the red velvet seats that gave the place a coziness you wouldn't expect.   We wanted to keep things lowkey for the night so we each just got an entree then shared a dessert. My boyfriend got the buckwheat noodles with shredded daikon and carrots in a ponzu vinegar sauce. The effect was delicious and tangy and the noodles were very well executed. My boyfriend can be quite picky with some unusual ingredients, but the combination of flavors in the ponzu sauce, something he's never had before, won him over after just one bite.  I had the roasted vegetable bourgogne. I didn't realize it would be a vegetarian version of the well-known beef bourgogne (blame it on the red wine I was drinking,) and seeing how it came out as a simple dish of portobello mushrooms, roasted carrots, potatoes, and pearl onions in a sauce, I was shocked at how much I fell in love with it. The red wine sauce was so divine, I hunted down the bread boys so I could have more pieces of bread with which to dip into the sauce.   We can never resist chocolate in most forms so, of course, we got the flourless chocolate cake. Now I've made this at home several times, but Bruell's decision to pair it with a minty vanilla scoop of ice cream was genius. The dense, rich chocolate cake disappeared in no time with absolutely no guilt. When something tastes that good, the calories magically become invisible.   The service was great. We loved our waitress and have no complaints. We're already planning our next visit. Our only debate now is which one of Bruell's restaurants will become our favorite?"}
{"text":"Talk about consistently delicious! I really loved dinner at this place after a comedy show at the square.  Other than our handy manhattans and lots of makers mark, we ordered the pork shank and the rabbit pappardelle. How many ways can I explain perfection?  I mean seriously-that enormous pork shank was everything I expect from a great little bistro in the Lower East Side of Manhattan let alone downtown Cleveland! I loved the crispy skin, the little tender tenderloin part... and the pasta? My gosh that tender rabbit, not too salty but just rich enough...mmm I just had dinner but I bet you if I had it now I'd chow down.  Trust me, C&H is one of those places that is super duper yummy!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I have been to all of Zack Bruell's restaurants and this is my favorite!   Had dinner with a friend here and it was unbelievable. We started the evening with their fresh baked bread, which was delicious, and their dipping oil and pink salt. The bread was fresh and fantastic.  I started with their romaine salad, which was out of this world. Completely amazing. The dressing was fantastic. The presentation was lovely as well.  I had the salmon with rice, sauteed spinach and miso sauce as my entree. It was unbelievable. The flavors were spectacular and the serving was about twice what I expected for the very reasonable $19.  My friend had the vegan stuffed peppers and she loved it. She said the sauce was amazing.  To say the least, we were both thrilled with our meals, especially for the money.   The environment was lovely, and we found free parking about 2 blocks or so away, which was nice and saved us the $8 valet charge (which seems rather high).   So while the service was honestly mediocre (we had a female server who seemed to despise her job and couldn't answer any of our questions) the food made that almost irrelevant.  The convenient location next to Playhouse is great as well."}
{"text":"Really not that great. I was expecting as better experience at a Zack Bruell restaurant. We ordered the chicken wings: bland. Beef shoulder: bland. My bf ordered the cod which was the only thing that was mildly tasty as was the sweet potato mash. But none of it was worth what we paid."}
{"text":"Just went here this past Sunday night, and it was one of the greatest dining experiences of my life I can say.  The food was superb, we ordered an appetizer, entrees, two dessert and coffees. Our waiter Dominic had an incredible knowledge of the menu, was very attentive, and had a wonderful and inviting personality.  The reason this experience was as good as it was was largely due to the quality of service. This staff really knows how to treat people like royalty. Thank you for an incredible evening!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant by chance after the theater.  We had rushed from work to our show and were starving by the time it was over.  The whole experience was really awful.  The staff was lethargic and acted like a bunch of zombies.  I understand that it was late, but when working a later shift you still have to provide upbeat service.  The food was really lack luster at best and the overall atmosphere was that of a morgue.  We were one of two couples in the area where we were seated and when they left the place was silent and the servers disappeared.  It was borderline creepy.  Never again."}
{"text":"I still believe that is a 5-star restaurant, however, I had just an \"okay\" experience last I went. First off, we were seated in a high traffic area which was annoying. Secondly, the bread guy was not doing his job. Thirdly, I did not like the chicken livers that I ordered (I have never had them so I had no idea what to expect). We did get a delicious bottle of wine, so that helped me get through the so-so experience. The wait staff was also very friendly and were accommodating for our timeline (we had to get to the show after dinner). Next time I go back, I will make a reservation further in advance and I will try a different entree!"}
{"text":"I found myself dining at Cowell & Hubbard shortly after reading Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho which might explain why I could not help but think it just the type of place one might find Patrick Bateman sipping J&B on the rocks  (should it be transplanted to Manhattan, of course).    Perhaps it was the ambient lighting, the cozy but close-quarters seating which allows for easy inspection of what everyone is wearing, or the presence of fresh cilantro in each of the dishes I ordered. Maybe it was our server, whose appearance was remarkably similar to Marcus Halberstram's, inquiring whether we were dining prior to a show and providing us with great service throughout the meal.  Unlike Bateman, Cowell & Hubbard transcends the superficial with deliciously nuanced cuisine and a pleasant experience in a modern setting. The shrimp and lobster bisque was rich, creamy, and flavorful with a lovely presentation. The braised lamb shoulder with sweet potato mash and rosemary au jus was good but did not quite have the 'punch' I was expecting from an entree in a fine dining establishment. I could not detect the influence of rosemary and the sweet potato actually stole the meal from the roasted lamb but all-in-all the entree was very good. My cocktail, tasting of grapefruit, was absolutely divine - I'm wracking my brain for the name of it but it simply is not there.  Whether you are merely an abstraction or an actual human entity I can recommend Cowell & Hubbard as a very nice fine dining experience. Call or use Open Table for dinner reservations; it's not quite as difficult to get into as Dorsia but well worth the forethought."}
{"text":"Came here before the ballet at the Ohio Theater (to see Cocktail Hour) about a block down the street. Attentive service with awareness of our time frame. Nice variety of things on the menu including the bone marrow appetizer I enjoyed. This item is not for those on a low fat diet! It's primarily fat. It was quite good and well presented. Then, I enjoyed the Sweetbread entree. Well presented also, breaded and fried thymus gland. Again, not for the faint of heart when it comes to food selections! Texture was good and it was properly cooked. Accompaniments were also delicious. Used my leftover fresh baked bread to clean my plate! Server recommenced two delicious desserts, all made by their pastry chef, not on-site, but at a local affiliated location. Mine was the meringue. Delicious and pleasingly crunchy. My wife enjoyed the salad and risotto (shrimp) and the strawberry dessert. I sampled the risotto and found it delicious. Well worth a visit. Prices fair for the location. Recommended."}
{"text":"Cowell & Hubbard was a great little lunch spot that my husband and I sought out when we were in Cleveland for a wedding. It was highly recommended on Yelp and so we took the advice and stopped in.   I ordered the braised beef cheeks and my husband ordered their pulled pork sandwich.   Normally, when I think of a pulled pork sandwich at restaurants, I think of the typical pork roast that's been shredded with ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, etc. added to it. It doesn't sound appeasing to me in the slightest. However, this was THE BEST pulled pork sandwich I had ever tasted and I'm so thankful that my husband ordered it! It was so flavorful! They sou vide the pork and as a result it's super tender. The tomato jam and fontina cheese were the perfect compliment to the savory pork. If you stop in for lunch, order this!  The braised beef cheeks were fabulous as well. It was served in a beef broth with dauphinoise potatoes, onions, peppers, mushrooms, olives, and fresh greens on the side. The broth was flavorful, although the fat should have been skimmed off the top of the broth (shocking for a Zach Bruell restaurant that this was not done). The vegetables were great and overall the dish was thoughtfully prepared, with the fat skimming neglect being the only negative.   The server was awesome and she gave us recommendations around the area for places to check out. We thought that was awesome that the server gave us rec's for around the area, even ones that were not affiliated with Cowell & Hubbard.   Next visit to Cleveland we will stop in here for dinner hopefully!"}
{"text":"This review is purely based on dessert, since that's all I went for late on a Saturday night after being at the Playhouse. I shared the apple crostata and the meringues. The apple crostata was pretty good but didn't knock my socks off. The phyllo crust was delicious, but lacked apples and was instead overpowered by the many raisins/craisins. It was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, which was yummy. The meringue was explained as \"space ice cream\" (accurate I guess but never though of describing meringues like that!)- I was describe more as a meringue ice cream sandwich. It was good but nothing special about the meringue...I scraped the delicious salty caramel ice cream off and ate it all instead! I think $7 is a bit steep to charge for a small scoop of my favorite Cleveland ice cream that I could pay half the price for a scoop twice a big a short distance away;)  Dessert wasn't a win for me, but the menu looks great and I look forward to returning to try it out for dinner one night! Service, on the other hand, was perfect and that's what really counts."}
{"text":"Top notch with well educated staff.  I like everything about this place.  We were able to try appetizers of escargot and asparagus, along with well prepared duck and vegetarian entrees.  Service was way above average, as was the food quality.  Not bad for a large group on New Year's Eve.  Please don't judge me for going out on New Year's Eve to a restaurant in Playhouse Square.  I was in the business for years and restaurants of the highest caliber can often miss the mark on nights like these.  C&H opened their menu to the public and seemed to easily withstand the tourists.  It helps to have the quality and staff levels, but the concept is equally well played.  This might be a 5 star check in soon, but I hesitate only because I have been here just once and it was NYE.    I did not love the German Chocolate Cheesecake.  A pastry chef would kick this up a star as well, all due respect if they have one, but evidence of this was clearly lacking.  It appears they are purchased from outside or simply unremarkable.  The best choice having been the assorted sorbets."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. We celebrated my grandfather's 80th birthday with dinner here and then went over to Playhouse Square to see War Horse. Let me tell you, this dinner put the evening off to a perfect start.  Quick review of my meal:  Butternut squash ravioli appetizer-- Holy cannoli, Batman! I got this after reading reviews of C&H and THANK YOU KIND REVIEWERS FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. It was giant and delicious and I'm only sad there wasn't more of it. I could have eaten that as a meal in and of itself. The best part? The tiny bits of jalapeno. Mmm-mm! Savory with a bit of a kick!  Golden Trout entree--pretty good, but not stupendous. It was well done and the flavors were nice, but I think I liked my mom's whitefish more.   Meringues for dessert--I'm usually a chocaholic, so I was having a hard time deciding between this and the Moca Pot de Creme, but I went with the waiter's recommendation and I am so glad I did. Best dessert I've had in a long time. The caramel was delicious, the ice cream was sweet and creamy, and the sea salt added just a tiny kick. Without the salt, the meringues and ice cream would have been too sweet, but with the salt.... WOWZA. My mother paid me back for stealing so much of her whitefish by stealing most of my dessert :(  Recommended entree: the crispy pork shank. The cracklings were sinfully good and the kale was amazing but what really made this dish were the dumplings. They were absolutely stupendous and quite honestly deserve their own dish.  The service itself was fantastic. My missed that her appetizer beet salad included onions, which she can't stand, and the waiter was kind enough to substitute her appetizer. My grandmother is also really picky about her salmon--to the point where she probably really should stop ordering it in restaurants--and the waiter was a saint about getting her exact specifications regarding how it should be cooked. Zack Bruell came out to ask how we were enjoying the meal and asked my grandfather how he was enjoying his birthday. It's probably pretty standard, but I appreciate that touch and I appreciated the waiter passing the message on.  The only downside is that the meal really did take about 2 hours and we were barely able to make it to the pre-show talk. So while I may not come again before a Broadway show (because 4:00pm is a bit early for me to eat dinner), I will definitely be back! I heard they have a post-show event with appetizer and drink specials--if the butternut squash ravioli is on that menu, I'll be back every night."}
{"text":"We went, like many others, before a show in playhouse square. We hadn't made a reservation but after only a few minutes of waiting, we were able to snag a few bar seats. We shared three tasty small plates and a couple of glasses of wine. The mussels were delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been traveling back and forth to Europe 6 to 8 times a year for the last 30 years and have eaten at many great places. Never in my life did I expect to have a memorable meal in Cleveland, OH where I just spent 3 days on business. Tonight was our last night and I  left it up to my assistant to make reservations after we have participated in two trade shows for the last 10 days.  I was ready for a surprise and when we entered the theatre district of Cleveland, I became more curious. Long story short . . . I had one of the most amazing dinners at Cowell & Hubbard, period. This Zack Bruell restaurant served a cold calamari salad appetizer and a cod/mushroom entree that were simply amazing. My assistant had the mussels and the beef shoulder and she could not stop bragging about it. The wine list was comprehensive and well assorted and the prices were more than reasonable.  Penny, the new GM was one of the nicest and accommodating young professionals I have met in the restaurant business and if the new menu they started tonight is an indication of the direction this restaurant is heading to, boy, this is going to be a success story! Should my business ever bring me back to Cleveland, my first stop will be undoubtedly this outstanding restaurant that I can recommend without hesitation. Well done, Penny!!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled - a business meal brought me here and the location was not previously known to the attendees. The entire service was excellent. Servers - despite having 35 hungry people in the party - did an amazing job with personal service for each guest, strong memories of drink selections and great interactions. The food did not disappoint; my main course, the red trout, is probably among the best I have had. Delicious food and top notch service would have me back here again."}
{"text":"We were disappointed.  We've been to several other  Zach Bruell restaurants, and have liked those better.  Some dishes were excellent, like the seafood dumplings and the desserts.  But neither my wife nor I particularly liked the salads (dull) and all of our entr√©es were fine, but nothing special.  In this price range in Cleveland, I expect special.  Our waiter was very charming, but very inattentive, and the kitchen was very slow (and the theater crowd was mostly gone by the time we arrived).  One problem I think is that it wasn't clear what the theme of this restaurant was.  L'Albatros is French country and Chinato is Italian/Tuscany.  I don't know what the focus of this place is supposed to be.  There is a fair amount of seafood, but there is a lot of other stuff.  It seems like a hodgepodge.  Second, with his fifth restaurant, I wonder if Bruell is getting spread a little too thin and is just not paying close enough attention.  I won't rush back."}
{"text":"After a Yelp event, my fiance and I decided to stop in for a drink and a quick bite to eat. Well actually, we stopped in for a drink, but the bartender was so nice and sold us on the late night menu that we decided to stay for a little while longer. (I realized that I was being upsold, but she was so nice about it that I didn't even mind)  I was very happy to see that the vegan seitan stuffed cabbage was on the late night menu. Unlike the dinner portion, you only get one stuffed cabbage, but that makes it perfect for a late dinner or an even better late night snack. I thought it was a really good little meal after having a Moscow Mule or two. My fiance had a pizza that he thought was just ok, but he really enjoyed a couple cocktails made my our nice bartender.   This is definitely a great place to stop for a late night drink and some grub after a show or if you happen to be in the area. Especially if you're looking for some vegan options."}
{"text":"I've been there twice. The first time (in 2013) was a birthday celebration. The food was flavorful, unique, colorful, and delicious. They brought out dessert with a little birthday candle....it was a nice and special little touch. The second time in (Dec. 2016) was a terrible experience because of the server. We had reservations at 6:15 and had to be at Ohio Theatre at 7:30. After being seated, we waited for over ten minutes with no server in sight, until I finally got up and told the host that we haven't seen our server and we have a show to catch. After another 5 minutes, she finally arrived and was not apologetic. We let her know that we had a show to attend and that we were ready to order (since we'd been waiting for 15 minutes, we knew what we wanted). Our food arrived incredibly fast, maybe within 10 minutes, so I felt much more relaxed about our time. My dish was kind of bland and didn't fill me up (porcini/cod/miso)...I was hungry later... but everyone else's dishes were amazing (salmon and cabbage rolls). I think I just ordered the wrong thing. We were done eating by 6:55. We then waited another 10 minutes before we saw the waitress again. She finally showed up and inquired about dessert. We said we'd like to share a dessert if it's quick, and she assured us it would be and grabbed some menus. Then she disappeared for another ten minutes. It was almost 7:20 when a waterboy came by to ask how we were doing. Exasperated, I said 'We need our checks!' He saw my frustration and ran to grab the bills. After he left, the waitress decided to show up and asked if we decided on dessert. Are you kidding?? I told her we were out of time and that someone was getting our checks. She left and returned (quickly...mercifully) with our bills (she must have found the waterboy who ran to prepare our separated checks). We had our credit cards in hand when she gave us the bills so she wouldn't run away again.  We were able to make it to our seats in Ohio Theatre with a couple minutes to spare. I was looking forward to a really nice experience at Cowell and Hubbard because my first time was so amazing. But that waitress really soured the whole experience. I don't know if I would go back...if I did, I would refuse to have that waitress again."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girlfriends before seeing The King and I at Playhouse Square. It was a great meal: friend and I shared the beet & watercress salad (the peach puree made it special!) and the vegan pizza (vegan fennel \"sausage\", tomato sauce, tofu mozz). The drink menu was diverse, though not as many vodka options as this girl would like. But they got creative for us and that worked out well! Thanks for a great GNO :)"}
{"text":"A well-oiled gustatory machine the regimented precision of which belies a draconian adherence to the shopworn axioms of diner lore (e.g. a water glass' depletion is inversely proportional to a patron's sense of wellbeing and thus must be attended to STAT), C&H hums along most brilliantly.  The servers sport modestly rebellious accoutrement (tattoos, vans, et al.) to subtly subvert the starched symbolic import of their white shirts and ties. The bread is crusty and fresh. The carrots spicy. The poblano is tough as expected, but filled with well-seasoned vegan crumbles (this reviewer, despite himself, suspects the invasion of Boca). There is something devilishly beguiling about the vegan cakes served athwart an ungodly pile of cilantro. The star of the experience (other than the prim perpendicular angles of the restaurant's windows and walls that, set against the infinite white paint, conjure good old Haus Wittgenstein (sans the altered ceiling)) is the dessert ganache: a squat and sturdy sweet round tower that is so rich as to induce paroxysms of pleasure. In sum, those seeking orderely service of vegetarian-friendly delectables should not be disappointed in this refashioned jewelry store. It glitters and glows. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Zack Bruell makes marvelous restaurants, and Cowell & Hubbard is no different. We went less than a week after its opening, but things are almost already firing on all cylinders. First, the good stuff. The place is elegant and modern, though I have never gone to any of Bruell's restaurants for the decor. The food was excellent. On this occasion, my husband and I dined with two close friends, so everyone was able to try a bit of everything -- and we ordered a lot. We all got appetizers, and the servers brought us spare plates for sharing. Standout apps included a playful and amazingly tasty beef \"ceviche\" with diced fruit and vegetable, the tower of crispy pork, and the radicchio salad. It was also great to see bone marrow on the menu, which was executed similarly to the now defunct Bar Symon version (that's a good thing). For entrees, two of us got fish, one got the outrageously large but incredibly tasty crispy pork shank, and one got excellent boneless - not skinless! - chicken thighs. The food was superb. Both fish filets were seasoned and cooked well. My dining companion raved that the thighs were like fancy elevated chicken wings. The pork was absurd in its scale and bordered on obscene in its flavor; it's an ode to the pig, featuring everything good about pork on one plate -- tender lean meat, pockets of fat, crunchy skin and decadent richness. My only niggles with the place are mostly related to its newness. The menu isn't as descriptive as it could be, which led me to order a side I didn't need. The service was very attentive but a bit uneven, the front desk wasn't particularly welcoming and seemed a bit unorganized, and we ended up with three menus even after they tried to get us a fourth. All minor issues and easily fixed as the place finds its legs. This part of town was really lacking in options like Cowell & Hubbard. I'm sure it'll do well with the theater crowd, but I'll be back whether I'm seeing a show or not."}
{"text":"C & H has been our go-to place before shows at Playhouse Square, but after three times (at least) of not being able to eat and get to the Broadway Buzz pre-show on time, we're out.  Last evening, we arrived at 5pm, were promptly seated and given menus, and our server told us about the specials.  She returned with an iced tea for me (the other three were happy with water), answered questions for our guest who has dietary restrictions (and she did so with great detail and advice, which was much appreciated), and took our dinner orders (no cocktails, no soup, one salad that came with the fixed price menu order, and four entrees).  The one salad and entrees arrived shortly thereafter, and everything was delicious.  Our server took our dessert order (just one item for the person who ordered from the fixed price menu), and . . . we waited.  After a while, it was close enough to 6:30 (start time for Broadway Buzz), that we attempted to flag a worker.  To no avail.  I decided to hold up the dessert menu above my head to attract someone's attention (we continued our conversation with our guests), and did that for several minutes until the manager came to our table.  At that point, we really needed to pay our bill (not just have the bill delivered to us), and book it to Broadway Buzz.  The manager did have our dessert item packaged after we left, and we walked back down after the show to pick it up and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"I just got back from Cleveland, where I had a wonderful dinner at Cowell & Hubbard with a large party hosted by the Cleveland Vegan Society. The gazpacho was beautiful, zesty and delicious, the stuffed poblano peppers an unexpected and outstanding main offering, and the desserts were WOW. And the staff couldn't possibly have treated us better. Some restaurants just sort of cobble something rather unremarkable together for vegans. Cowell and Hubbard, though, presented a creative, delectable, and visually stunning experience with every course. Very impressed. Thank you!"}
{"text":"i am NOT a fan of zach bruell's restaurants. have had bad experiences, in the past with parallax, chinato, etc. poor service or mediocre food. well, cowell & hubbard is his best venture yet........it's very good, very cool vibe/atmosphere, attentive & friendly service......... the highlights for all 4 of us were the appetizers and desserts. we all enjoyed a couple of rounds of cocktails from the list of specialty drinks on the back of the menu. menus is VERY large, lots of choices, but we managed to narrow it down. i can't remember everything everybody had, but i'll try..... i had the escargot.......INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! i could have had 3 portions dumped in 1 bowl with a ton of bread to sop up the creamy, buttery broth/sauce. my guests also had a crab cake, it had thai overtones, the bacon & eggs (an egg \"souffle\" strata type thing with a couple of chunks of pork belly. for my salad course i enjoyed the radicchio salad with maracona almonds and bleu cheese with a tarragon vinaigrette.........i detected no tarragon, but balsamic vinegar only....but it was still good. on guest had the frisee with fried chicken livers and it too was quite good.......for my entree i had the sweetbread.........it was good but i didn't notice if the menu stated that they were fried or not.......had i known that they were fried i would have opted for something else. the greasy flavor of the sweetbreads overwhelmed me........you could have put fried beef strips on the plate and i wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.........and i love sweetbreads, but this was not something i would order again. plus, there were artichoke petals throughout the dish that were tough and woody........the moroccan olives were a bit overpowering. it all was just OK, not great........the paris brest dessert was good, chewy, but tasty. the dessert highlight was the meringues filled with salted caramel ice cream. FINALLY a SALTED caramel dessert where i could actually TASTE the salt! overall a good place with lots of \"old school\" style entrees, appetizers and desserts that hark back to menus of yesterday......... i liked it enough to book a reservation for an upcoming special occasion.    if they could get the pretentious servers at parallax to behave in a respectful & friendly manner as all the staff at cowell & hubbard does, i would consider going back.......but until then, C & H is the only bruell restaurant i'd return to."}
{"text":"Great food, service. The crispy pork stack appetizer was very good and the beef short ribs were great."}
{"text":"The Zack Bruell restaurants are split pretty evenly in my mind: I love Parallax and L'Albatros, but Chinato and Table 45 fall pretty flat. Cowell & Hubbard walks the midline. I've been here twice (once on Valentine's Day and once on a random Friday night). Both times the service has been outstanding! I love how friendly and attentive everyone is, regardless if its one of the busiest nights of the year or just any other Friday night.  On my recent visit, I tried the following:  - Shrimp and lobster bisque: This soup is HEAAVVY....and not entirely in a good way. It's certainly flavorful and fun with corn and potatoes adding nice texture to the creamy soup, but it's just WAAY TOO heavy and full to be a good appetizer. I felt like I'd instantaneously coated my blood vessels with plaque and signed up for a pant size increase!   - Seafood dumplings: Best dumpling I've ever had! You must order this! You can never go wrong with a dish that has pickled veggies in it...I wish I could pickle everything in sight ARHGH!   - Spicy Bouillabaisse: I ordered this because I saw a lady at the next table eating it. Boy I wish I had paid more attention to the fact that she really wasn't eating much of it at all! This dish was SO SALTY. I've never been subjected to such an assault on my senses!! Same comments about coating blood vessels apply here (see shrimp and lobster bisque). I took most of this home as leftovers and had to add some heavy cream to cut down the saltiness and add back some creamy flavor (ignore comment about blood vessels....the heavy cream was necessary in this instance!)   - Rabbit Gnocchi: My beau ordered this and it was fantastic! The gnocchi were deliciously cheesy and creamy and the rabbit had a similar presentation and flavor profile to pulled pork. The rabbit was a little on the salty side, but the gnocchi cut the sodium high pretty well.   *Tip: BYOB like all the Zack Bruell restaurants (except for Table 45)."}
{"text":"Stopped there for drinks with friends after Marc Maron show (excellent). Worst drink value I have experienced in a very long time. Martinis and Cosmopolitan. Drink level was barly 5/8 full at an astronomical price. Not the way Zak treated customers before he became a restaurant magnate. Will not go back! I wonder if it is the same at Parallax?"}
{"text":"Came here before a concert at The Wolstein Center. We had reservations for 4:30pm and arrived about 4:15. We decided to sit at the bar rather than get a table. We were greeted pretty quickly by the chick behind the bar, Kate. Shortly after that though she took the tables that started to fill up around the bar, while another guy took our order. We started by ordering drinks as well as a salad and an app. As we waited for our order, we heard the tables around us being offered the specials while no one explained them to us which was my first problem. Our food came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. The mussels are a must if your into seafood. Our finished plates sat there a little too long for comfort before we had to wave a third person over who seemed to be a manger and told him we were ready to order our entrees. He sent back to us the first gentleman. We ordered a trout dish which we shared and again was super tasty and light. Big enough to share. Again we waited for our plates to be cleared as the restaurant begin to fill up we seemed to become more and more invisible. We were still pretty early so we did decide to order another drink but requested the bill at the same time so we did not have to wait. After we finished and went to leave Kate acknowledged us again and wished us a good evening. She was on point with all of her tables and had she been our server the whole scene would have been better. Overall the food was one hundred percent on point but the service was very unpleasantly disappointing."}
{"text":"Decent, but overrated for the price.   The main seafood courses were good (I had cod, others had salmon).   The bread was not warm. The salads were lacking and overpriced. Our waiter was uninterested (despite mentioning we were celebrating our Dad's birthday, he did not check in on our food, do anything special, and misunderstood his beer recommendation as a preference instead of giving a tasting as he promised). The crispy giant pork stack was too rich and fatty.  One time visit was enough. Nothing special unfortunately although we were looking forward to a special night."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Asian-French fusion food...this place is delicious.  The service was impeccable.  We ate in The Vault...it was a nice room.  The music is WAY too loud for this place to be romantic, so keep that in mind.  However, the food is splendid.  We had salads, sweetmeats, seafood \"dumplings\", mussels Proven√ßal, chicken wings, strip steak au poivre, golden trout, truffle chicken breast, and the playhouse burger.  Everything was spectacular, cooked perfectly and was delicious. Everyone LOVED everything! The manager was amazing; he knew we were trying to catch the next Hilarities show, so he CALLED THEM and asked if it was okay to bring our bachelorette party cake.  They quickly boxed our meals, presented the check and were very conscientious of out time restriction.  Five star service, five star food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been working through our list of 20 places to eat in Cleveland in 2013, and we decided to check this one off of our list for our anniversary this past weekend. Being vegan, I was particularly happy to see that there were several options for me on the menu and it was the primary reason we decided to eat here.  The ambiance is modern and sleek, and the restaurant is very open with complete views to the kitchen and serving area. It has a totally different vibe than the only other Bruell restaurant we have eaten at - L'Albatross. The servers work as a team, so don't be alarmed when many different servers attend to you throughout your meal - at first, we were wondering why someone else had come to see about our drinks after our initial server, but then they explained that to us.   I started with the fried shishito peppers without the cheese on top, and while I have never eaten a plate of peppers before, the flavor of this was quite good. My husband also liked them. He had a basic salad (the name is not on the online menu and I cannot remember what it was called) that had eggplant, tomatoes, Parmesan, and a couple of other veggies.   For entrees, I had the eggplant stuffed tofu with caponeta, which was really tasty. It looked pretty, and let's be honest - even vegans will tell you that tofu doesn't always look so great sitting on the plate. My husband had truffled chicken breast and he liked it.   My husband had a beer, and I had the featured cocktail that was being prepared in honor of The Lion King - it was called the Mufasa, and tasted kind of like a watermelon mojito/margarita. It was incredibly strong and not enjoyable - I only had half and the rest went to waste. What a shame for a $10 cocktail! (I rarely drink, so this was a big deal for me!)   They surprised us at the end of our meal with a sorbet for our anniversary.   The location near the theaters was outstanding and so was the valet parking service. I would eat here again because of the vegan options, but I am not in a hurry to do so. As a whole, my husband and I enjoyed our experience at L'Albatross better."}
{"text":"Had an excellent dining experience here over the weekend  before going to see Chicago at Playhouse Square.  I even got seated close to John O'Hurley and 2 other cast members who were dining with him.  All food ordered by myself and 2 other guests with me was enjoyable.  Service was great, and the server made sure to ask what the curtain time was in order to have dinner done in time."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night without reservations.   The night was to be a celebration for us in that I finally sold a business & real estate earlier in the week.  We also had tickets for the Indians game that evening.   We arrived at 5:30 and were promptly seated.  Received water, bread and an introduction from our server (Juan) within minutes.  Looked over the menu, and waited, waited and waited for Juan to return. Some 25 minutes later, he finally returned and asked if we were ready to order.  He apologized for taking so long to return, and I in turn expressed my displeasure with the amount of time he took and told him he had better be more attentive going forward.  I then asked about a wine on the wine list.  He said he was not familiar with that particular wine and would get someone who could answer my question.  The manager showed up promptly, answered my questions, offered additional information and left.  Where was Juan?  Obviously not interested in learning about the wine menu OR taking our order if the wine I asked about was the one I wanted to order.  About 5 minutes later, the manager returned to seat another party.  At this point, we had enough.  We called over the manager and told him about our 30+ minute wait, and asked if we owed anything for the bread and water.  He at first argued with us (probably a misunderstanding based on his answering our wine questions 4-5 minutes earlier) and then asked what he could do to make the situation right.,  At this point we declined his offer and left.  Don't know if the problem was with Juan specifically or they just have bad service overall, but we won't return to this restaurant or any Zack Bruell establishment. To make things worse, we made eye contact with other wait staff while waiting, and they all seemed to acknowledge/ignore us at the same time.  I got the feeling they saw we were irritated, but none of them took seemed to take any action to find Juan.  Bottom line is the service sucked.  Fortunately we were able to salvage the evening at Heinen's (go figure),with a great build your own salad, super selection of reasonably priced wine and easily save $100+.   AND the Indians won!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but after visiting a second time, I don't know that I can rave about this place anymore.... We didn't get our drinks until after our dinner came. We saw another server take our drinks to another table, and after our dinner came, they remade ours.  They did remove them from the bill, and were apologetic, but one of the managers came over to apologize and informed us that they were comping the drinks, and strangely said \"we don't like to do this, but we will\" well, I don't like to drink my 'before meal martini' after my dinner arrives, but I did.  I couldn't even order wine with my meal because I still had a martini to finish, so I guess we all do things we don't want to do, We didn't complain, and yes, they should have come over and they should pay for them, but he made us feel bad about it, when it wasn't our mistake....I thought they were snobby when we came in, too.  I wasn't impressed, and they changed the menu, and that was a bit of a let down too. My husband's chicken was delicious, but my boar wasn't anything special.  If I come back, I'll sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Excellent food & wonderful service.  All of the food we had was very good - excellent seasoning & nice presentation.  I had vegan tomato soup $ vegan stuffed cabbage w/sietan & brown rice. My wife had the mushroom soup & rainbow trout.  Service was attentive, very courteous & prompt. Wines were good. Their use of golden raisins in the entrees added a great flavor.  An expensive meal, but quality all the way."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I went here last night for my birthday. We had a fabulous time! Our waitress, Amy, was funny and attentive, and her service was on point. She also gave some great wine suggestions for our meals. We started off with some appetizers (cheeseboard was a fun adventure, the seafood dumplings that were to die for, crispy pork stack, and butternut squash ravioli). The apps were great and plenty enough for everyone to share! Dinner was great too! Everyone enjoyed their meals. I got the rabbit gnocchi and was a little disappointed, because it seemed on the salty side. But it didn't ruin the meal, and I just know to get something else next time. I was also impressed by the fact that the manager came several times to see how we were doing. Also, they put a candle in my dessert because they knew it was my birthday- a nice touch.   Overall, it was great and my friends (all of whom are on the pickier side, and from out of town) raved about it the entire night. I was definitely pleased and will be going back!"}
{"text":"The butternut squash pizza is my absolute favorite. The crust is perfect and I love the butternut squash, arugula and cheese. The cheese is a bit salty which add a great dimension to the pizza. I have ordered this the last 3 times I've had lunch. The bread, olive oil and salt that they start you out with is good too."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was excellent! Sweetbreads were cooked to perfection. The dessert was amazing, not too sweet, just right."}
{"text":"This beautiful 4 star restaurant is positioned in the Playhouse District near CSUs campus and seemingly thrives amongst those coming in the area for a great meal, cocktails, or after show dinner. You can tell when a show is near as it's crowded for awhile and then eerily empty the next. Regardless, they have delicious bread (from near On The Rise bakery)  and oil w/ fresh Himalayan salt nearby, very tender (no knife necessary) Beef Shoulder, quality crafted salads (creamy goat cheese and fresh bacon is a must try), and salmon dishes.  Hit or miss service and understated d√©cor.  Recommended if you are going to a show or want a fancy meal in the Playhouse District."}
{"text":"Went out with some friends (including fellow yelper Fung and yelper Young), to try yet another Zack Bruell restaurant. And it was good.  Although the premise of this restaurant is confusing- (is it French? Italian? Pan-Asian? Seems more like a mutt of themes..seriously, there's a banh mi?), the food itself is excellent, probably the best of the Zach Bruell restaurants that I've tried.  We ordered the golden trout. Whew, who would have ever thought of putting pomegranate seeds on fish? Man, it was the right amount of crispiness, tenderness, with a great bite into the pomegranate seeds to cause a freshness of taste in your mouth...wow. I ate every single bite of that fish (and my bf and I had split it...and it was enough to fill both of us!).   From around the table, I tried the others' entrees.  Bone Marrow- meh...I've had better. For the price of it and all...I still prefer Lolas. Roasted whole chicken- super tender meat and flavorful. Sweetbreads- it was slightly disturbing that the waiter didn't have a clue of what it was made out of. (thymus?) But..umm. it tasted alright. Pork shank- oh baby, that was a mammoth of a plate. It was definitely good- tender like straight from the crockpot, but a tad oily. But still good.  Cowell & Hubbard impressed me a lot better than the other Bruell restaurants. It didn't necessarily blow me away, but I thought it was a solid good. And be ready to eat here...the portions are gigantic!"}
{"text":"Came back here for bf's 26th birthday.   Omg. Loved it. Like all the Zack Bruell restaurants, they let you bring wine, so I was pretty happy wining during dinner.  Service again was attentive, although really slow. Wasn't in a rush, so it didn't bother me too much.  Appetizers: - Seafood dumplings (this came as a recommendation from our waitress); normally we wouldn't order this as bf is not a big seafood fan, but we were both so so so glad that we got this. I would come back just for this. SO flavorful. I loved the sourness from the sauerkraut on the bottom of the dish. Love love love this.  - Crispy pork stack (again); not as much flavor as I was expecting, but still decent - maybe because it was after I ate the seafood dumplings.   Entrees: - Crispy pork shank; LOVE this dish too. This was amazing. The crispy skin on the outside with just a big of fat in every bite. The flavor was amazing. I would come back just for this as well. - Veal with risotto; this was not as good as the crispy pork shank. Less flavorful. Meat was really tender though. Probably would not get this again.  Dessert: Chocolate mousse; good, chocolatey.   Why 5 stars? The seafood dumplings and crispy pork shank alone makes me forget about the other dishes. Would love to come back to try happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Been to Chinato and Table 45 (which I didn't like that much - see my review on Chinato and table 45), which is also owned by the same chef, I was a little skeptical coming to this restaurant, but I decided to give it a try. BUT this place is definitely better than Table 45 and probably Chinato too.  The restaurant aims for a upper class population, but it's not intimidating at all. I definitely felt comfortable dining there as probably the only person in their 20s in the restaurant. The food was pretty good, but I would not suggest the foir gras fried donuts - that thing was just SO OILY that I didnt even want to touch it after I saw it. Then the ratio of foir gras/donuts was just so low that it probably doesn't worth the price. Other than that, it's a decent french restaurant, not as salty as l'albatros. I would highly recommend red fish - one of their most popular dishes!"}
{"text":"In typical Bruell fashion, this place is gorgeous inside.  Despite high ceilings and large open spaces, it's got a cozy feel to it.  The service, from the front desk to the multitude of people who replenish your water & bread and take your order, is prompt, polite and friendly.  I had the Moroccan cured olives pizza with red peppers, eggplant, fennel and chick pea pur√©e.  The concept is right but the recipe may need to be tweaked because it's very dry and very salty.  I ate only about one slice of it.  The braised beef shoulder with dauphinoise potatoes, roasted carrots and natural juices is excellent - the beef was tender and perfectly done and the potatoes were amazing.  Their aviation cocktail is very citrusy with a strong lemon taste.  The Tusker lager from Kenya was light and refreshing.  They have a large selection of small plates which is perfect for people with plans to go to Playhouse Square after their meal which makes Cowell & Hubbard a perfect stop before a show."}
{"text":"Cowell & Hubbard is a very nice restaurant right in the heart of Playhouse Square....  The ambiance is upscale.  I made a reservation for a Friday night at 7:30, and it was pretty empty.  The menu has a variety of seafood and chicken dishes as well as pastas and vegan meals.  I started with a bowl of the cream of wild mushroom soup.  It was dotted with olive oil.  While it wasn't the best cream of wild mushroom soup I've had (that title goes to ZIngerman's Road House in Ann Arbor), it was good, warm, filling and hit the spot on a cold, rainy night.  In addition, they brought out complimentary bread with olive oil and had little bowls of Himalayan sea salt to put in the oil  It was delicious!  For my entree, I ended up getting the chicken thighs.  Like others have mentioned, they are kind of an upscale take on fried chicken.  While the taste was very good, I found them difficult to eat.  They were served on a bed of celery root puree.  It was kind of like chicken on top of a rich soup.  I thought it would have been more decorative than an actual bowl of liquid.    It wasn't what I was expecting.  I didn't care for the taste of the puree. It was very sweet.  Kind of tasted like apple cider.... I could only eat half as I was still full from the wild mushroom soup.  Prices were a little on the high side, but the amount of food you received for the money is adequate.    Service was fantastic.  They had a full bar and a very nice dessert option that looked delightful.  It's worth a stop if you are in the Playhouse Square area."}
{"text":"Wow ... So my wife and I go into the city about 4-5 times a year to get a nice dinner(maybe, if your a snob, you will find that my tastes are not as pretentious as most) But this place is trash and will not even be open long judging from the amount of empty tables that were all around us.    If you read nothing more from this point, my advice is choose ANYTHING ELSE if you are from out of town. Seriously McDonalds is a better alternative.  Btw, in addition to this place being most likely the worst meal I have ever eaten, it was also the most expensive meal I have purchased since I was on vacation in Hawaii.  So we go there after a play and order the \"crispy pork stack\". The one star I give to this place is the presentation of the appetizers, which was very deceiving because the rest of the evening was down hill from this point. It was pork 'something' stacked on risotto, stacked on collard greens (which by the way was needlessly plopped on every dish without soup in the title). My wife and I were very hungry when we ate it and sadly ate it. So the mystery meat that was the crispy pork, is something that was so gross that I had to go far back in my childhood to relate it to anything I have ever eaten. All I could relate to the scorched meat was it tasted like the shredded beef jerky that they sold in snuff tins at gas stations to mimic chewing tobacco for kids.  The soups were atrocious also. They wreaked of having no flavor, and the preparation method felt as if they put all the ingredients in a food processor, turned it on, and walked away for 30 minutes.   Main courses were giant pork shank, which seemingly must have been prepared by the soup guy, must've been dropped in the deep fryer for 30 minutes because it was inedible. Collard greens included.   My wife ordered the lamb shoulder, which I didn't even offer to taste, was baked until it was grey. Collard greens included.  Everything had been burned so bad at this point that we begged for our check for 10 minutes so that we could find salvation in leaving the restaurant.   We were so disappointed and will seriously evaluate any decision of eating out at the expense of $50+ a plate. This place was the antithesis of a perfect ending of catching a dinner and a show at Cleveland Playhouse Square."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I called to try to make reservations and they said they were completely booked.  We decided to go anyways because we were told the same by the staff at Alley Cat & we walked in and there were tons of tables.  Luckily, we guessed right and were seated immediately.  So, if the staff tells you they have no reservations, go anyways and they'll probably seat you within 5 minutes.  The service here was exceptional.  Our waiter was friendly and the support staff was on point.  The cocktails were strong and the food was delicious.  We enjoyed the goat cheese ravioli and the pork stack appetizers--both dishes had unique flavor profiles that were executed very well.  My boyfriend had the Latin lamb shoulder and I had the beef shoulder for dinner.  Both were phenomenal.  We ended with the caramel meringue.  If I could give them 6 stars, I would.  We will definitely be coming back to dine again."}
{"text":"Guess what!  We were going to a show at the Playhouse, so Cowell & Hubbard was an obvious choice.  They were very nice and accommodating, but...  Let's start with the good.  This is a big restaurant with a big bar and lots of seating.  The deco is best described as hotel restaurant chic.  They have multiple beers on tap, 3 of which are from Zachary Bruell's collision bend.  The menu has a large list of salads, small plates, and entrees.  Desserts looked delicious.  The food came out extremely quickly and the order was correct.  Now the bad.  It took us 20 minutes to get our glasses of wine after the waiter took the order.  He said \"the bar is pretty backed up\" and which point I was tempted to ask him to bring the bottle and I would pour it myself.  We ordered the chicken spring roll and the mussels and frites.  The mussels and frites were an interesting combo, and the mussels were done perfectly.  The spring roll on the other hand? Yikes,  I don't have a word to describe it.  Not a spring roll? No chicken?  Either way, the waiter took it back and the manager came over and apologized.  The manager then brought out our requested replacement small plate, kobe beef meatballs.  They were small, but good.  These are probably of the US \"Kobe\" beef variety and not the real Japanese \"Kobe\" considering the price.  I also witnessed another table send back the bone marrow small plate, which again the manager brought out a replacement.  So, the staff is extremely professional in how they go about their service.  No complaints.  But maybe, just maybe, the food is slipping in quality and preparation?"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Cowell & Hubbard for lunch many times. The food is always fantastic - no questions there! The services has been hit or miss, with a strong lean towards hit, but still you set expectations, right?!?! I like the changing menu, with some standard fare, because I know I'm always going to get something in season, fresh, and tasty!  Note - I haven't tried Cowell & Hubbard for happy hour or dinner. I need to add that to the list."}
{"text":"I went for Zack Bruell Restaurant Week before heading to a show at Playhouse. I ended up getting the same waitress I had last time I came here. She didn't remember me I don't think, but she was just as good. Very knowledgeable about the menu items, she could tell what is in every single one and how they are prepared. The broth my appetizer of muscles were in was very flavourful. I loved the red fish over a bed of pureed cauliflower. And the apricot sorbet for dessert was amazing. Truly an enjoyable and relaxing evening. I also really liked how they waitress when she came back to check how the food was asked each person individually and specifically regarding their dish instead of just generally asking the table how everything was."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went here before heading to a theatre show. Our waiter was great in asking what time our show was to be able space the appropriate time in between our  appetizers, entrees and desserts. He was also informative in the meals and drink menu. Great environment with well done food!"}
{"text":"I love the food and service at this restaurant. I have been here twice and the food and service were awesome. My new theater pre-dining spot."}
{"text":"Very good menu selection.  For the type of restaurant, I felt that I received good value for what I spent.  Ordered the pork shank and it was pretty awesome.  The kale and dumplings were also very good.  Had the shrimp stuffed peppers as an app, but they were way spicier than the server lead us to believe. The beer selection is pretty good for the type of restaurant also with some unique drafts and a good bottle selection.  Overall, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. My bartender, Ian, was great. I had the Fennel crusted wild boar loin with mushroom risotto.  It was perfectly cooked and outstanding.  I paired this with a Troegs Dopplebock for a wonderful dinner. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker. Food was awesome and reasonably priced. Dinner menu looked a little expensive for similar food so I would recommend going during lunch. Awesome fish dishes."}
{"text":"Three of us went for dinner prior to the show. Best thing was the Pinot Noir. Vodka and soda is not a vodka and tonic. The two steaks ordered were cooked to the correct doneness but arrived at room temperature. The managers solution, \"let me know the next time you are coming in and I will take care of you personally.\" No solution for this visit, so there won't be a next time Mr Grano."}
{"text":"Came here for a Yelp event on a Monday evening, but am not reviewing it based on the event.  Prior to the event, I ordered drinks at the bar with my husband. He got a beer and I got a delicious pink cocktail. I can't remember the name of it but it had the word \"grenade\" in it. Our bartender was not particularly friendly, she rubbed me the wrong way for some reason and was trying to be funny but it came across as sarcasm. Also took us forever to flag someone down to get us our check for our drinks (we were sitting at the bar, shouldn't have been that difficult). The look of the restaurant is pretty, lots of red and very sleek. The drinks are pricey, over $10 for my drink, but it was perfectly crafted. Not sure why the attire for this place is listed under \"dressy\" when all of the servers are wearing jeans!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so you know when you look forward to a place for days and then finally make it, but you want to try EVERYTHING on the menu, so its bitter-sweet?! Well, C&H is kinda like that for me.  From the Italian 'Dipinti' pinot grigio with the buttery, tender escargot, to the halibut special- I was pleasantly pleased with the attentive service, fresh fare and the fact that there was only one other couple in the area that made for quite interesting 'people-watching'!  I only wish I were in town long enough to enjoy their offerings during the big chandelier unveiling on May 2, which sounds like a festivus for sure. Until next time, Cheers and merci beaucoup!"}
