{"text":"We had a craving for lobster on one of our visits to Jacques Cartier place.  We saw the sign for this restaurant when we dined across the street at Yardin Nelson on our first night in Montreal.
We both had lobster and filet mignon.  The steak and seafood were both really good, but the sides were unappealing (the rice was too salty and the vegetables lacked flavour.)  The meal comes with salad and a dessert (chocolate mousse).  This was definitely the most tourist oriented restaurant we tried, but we still had a good time.  
The service was good and the location is great for tourists wanting to stroll along the pier afterwards."}
{"text":"We were walking along Rue Saint Paul and saw this place which serves lobsters, other seafood, and steaks. It looked pack and the menu has meal deals starting at $19.99-$45. The meals come with soup/salad, entree, dessert and coffee. The soup and salad are house or soup of the day. Desserts and coffees are also house.

We order from $19.95, $27.95,and $33.95. From the $19.95, we ordered saut√©ed shrimps, $27.95 we ordered braised lamb shank, and $33.95, we ordered lobster and filet mignon. They all came with the same sides of rice pilaf, carrots, potatoes slices, and broccoli. The lamb shank was the worse I've eaten and I love lamb. It was dried, over cooked, and coated with dried rosemary and lacked flavor. The lobster was only half if a whole lobster which was disappointing for the price and it didn't state half lobster on the menu. We felt like we got cheated. The filet mignon was over cooked but we let the waiter know and he took it back and brought out another piece but it didn't look fresh. Overall, this place looks nice and menu items are great but you do felt cheated for the price you paid."}
{"text":"The lamb chop was properly cooked. The texture was great, but the sauce did not meet my standard. On the other hand, the most enjoyable dish was deep fried calamari. It was so tender and soft...it is a must-order.
The service defeintely needs improvements though"}
