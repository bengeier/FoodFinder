{"text":"Great place but very odd hours.  Unable to grab something before or after work ( work 8-5 Monday - Friday). Wish they had normal operating hours. I only ranked this business a 3 based on that."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop and I must recommend the peanut butter cookie-absoltely delicious!"}
{"text":"A perfect little hole in the wall cafe in Spruce Cliff.  Excellent espresso, and surprisingly good sandwiches.  I also love their ginger cookies when they have them.  I hope it stays around a long time."}
{"text":"The Little Monday Café is a small location of great small bites and delicious coffee.  Being located just off of Bow Trail in Spruce Cliff, the Little Monday Café is a little out of the way for most people. For the locals however, it's a popular place to drop by for a coffee and some friendly conversation. The Café owner will delight you with her delicious pastries cooked in house or a selection of frozen gluten free items. The Café offers various sandwiches and breakfast/lunch items but the real reason to go is the coffee. They have a delicious coffee roaster who roasts their coffee for them in Calgary (I believe). The atmosphere is far friendlier than your average coffee shop with fast service. Be sure to get there on an off hour if you want to get a table though, as there is not much for seating.  This Little Café is definitely worth a stop if you're in the area."}
