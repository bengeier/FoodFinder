{"text":"Just ate here with my so due to the great reviews. Service was above average. Food and price was average at best, for what it is. I don't usually come to a korean sushi restaurant for their unique service style that not everyone can appreciate, I only get sushi for the food, and it was underwhelming at it's price point. Definitely not five stars."}
{"text":"Loved the cozy atmosphere. The chef was an absolute delight and my food was superb. Definitely going back !!"}
{"text":"It's a small place but the sushi and service is top notch. My personal favourite is the spicy combo. You get good value and fresh sushi, what else can you ask for."}
{"text":"The owner is so friendly and kind! One time my card didn't work and he gave me my meal for free. Amazing food and good prices!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, incredibly priced. No compromise in quality. Amazing for takeout. Good for eat-in as long as you are good with a basic atmosphere. 

Wonderfully friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Real sushi is from real Japanese people... Amazing service and yummiest food ever. Dont waste your time and health anywhere else. You get hooked on."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best sushi places I have been to. Always fresh, service is amazing and so reasonable.  My favourite choice is the dynamite dragon roll, or the chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious and fresh!  

The prices are fantastic and the owner is super friendly. If your order takes a while to prepare, he'll make it up to you by giving you a few extra pieces or some spring rolls. 

I don't live in Oakville anymore but when i visit, I will definitely drop by Wasabi Teriyaki"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the sushi.  Small cozy place and the owner is very nice and accommodating. Their spicy salmon is very good.  I would also recommend their shrimp udon"}
{"text":"Is this the best sushi I've ever had? 
No, but it is definitely my new go-to place for sushi outside of Toronto for dine-in or take-out. My personal favourites are the spicy salmon roll and the spicy shrimp (battered lightly with thai sauce). Prices and quality are great for suburban standards.

Service is good- the staff remembers returning customers and is always attentive. When we wanted to customize the 5 roll loveboat we ordered (switched out a Cali roll for Spicy salmon) they were very accommodating. Once the owner even offered to postpone our bill and just pay him next time when our card wasn't working.

I was reading a previous review of how someone was commenting on strange things such as getting bottled water at no extra charge- why complain? I usually carry bottled water with me when I go out and when I forget, I really appreciate that I can take this cold bottle with me. Also, the owner is super nice and tries to strike up a conversation/make connections with his customers, but perhaps other people may be too sensitive to casual comments."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I don't live in the area. I come for the quality and simplicity of the food they serve. I also like the ambience. Staff are nice and I couldn't help but notice the fast service they provide for pick up orders."}
{"text":"Great experience for my family and I. Food was fresh. The rolls were made with just the PERFECT amount of rice. I hated when sushi restaurants try to fill you up with a roll that have more rice to filling ratio. Not a lot of options but the essential popular dishes are available. 
We would definitely come back.

Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place to go for sushi and korean cuisine in oakville. The owner is really nice and the service is relatively speedy"}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant twice while I was out here on business and was very satisfied.  The food and the service was great, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.  Highly recommended to anyone nearby."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, since it's in a strip mall, but the sushi is amazing -- we had the large sushi boat and everything was fresh, and the rolls were huge. It was so good we had another small boat. The gyoza were fantastic as well, and the owner was super-friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place! (Tip: This restaurant is tiny  so call ahead if you are a large group). The decor is charming - they have fossils!

Now about the food. We ordered avocado sushi with tempura bits and a spicy stir fry noodle dish called Yakisoba upon recommendation from the owner.  

Both dishes were fresh and delicious! The avocado roll was great, with a nice big chunk of perfectly ripe avocado. We loved the flavour from the black sesame seeds on the outside of our rolls. We've never had a noodle dish at a Japanese restaurant as tasty as this one. The sauce was spicy with a hint of sweetness. It came with lots of veggies and we enjoyed the chewy texture of the hearty soba noodles. 

We will visit this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed with the quality of their fish.

Ordered the large maki, sushi & sashimi party tray 70 pieces for $59.99 and honestly, 1/3 of the tray was vegetable rolls, the other 1/3 was anything salmon related and the rest was just meh. There was so much salmon. I wouldn't mind if it was decent quality but the quality of salmon that was provided was all you can eat grade. If I wanted to gorge myself with low quality salmon, I'd go to an all you can eat restaurant. The tuna sashimi was literally 1/3 of the size of the salmon sashimi and also lower grade. I don't mind low grade sashimi but I don't think it's right to charge this price for mediocre quality. The rice was lacking mirin and had a faint taste of sushi rice. Also, they only gave us at most two teaspoons of wasabi when we ordered 70 pieces but gave us literally a cup of soya sauce. Like why?

We called in to order take out and was informed that it would be an hour or so for the tray to be ready. We weren't too thrilled but waited anyway. When we got to the restaurant, it was completely empty. The folks working here seems nice but overall, I would not recommend this place nor would I return."}
{"text":"A nice quiet hole in the wall sushi place. The owner/chef is all about freshness. He's very honest and the service is great."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken teriyaki and beef yakisoba. Both come with rice, veggies and a spring roll. Total cost of 21 dollars or so. 3 people ate it quite easily, with leftovers. Dad can't eat spicy food, so the flavours were great. It wasn't too salty or sour. Just tasted fresh and enjoyable. The owners seem quite nice. I'm not sure if credit is taken at this place though, as I paid cash. 
Since it was Saturday night and business was booming, had to wait a bit for food to be prepared. Still, well worth it."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem. Their sushi and sashimi is delicious and always fresh. Their tampura is not overly greasy. Their edemame are cooked just right and are never mushy. Their staff is always wonderful. 

I can't comment on the actual atmosphere of the restaurant since I only so takeout, but it is always ready quickly and the right items are pipping hot. It does look quite nice inside though with a few booths, lots of bamboo and greenery. 

Prices are outstanding. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"So good!

Looking for a place to eat, I stopped in. Being vegetarian, I always scope out the veggie options first. There are many! 

The music is nice, the AC was cool and the place was clean.

As for the food- delicious! My rolls were so fresh and the rice was the perfect stickiness. Yum!

Absolutely recommend! 

Only about 5 tables though, so if it gets busy you're going to have to choose take-out."}
{"text":"Great service and fair pricing! Environment has a really homey and cozy feel, server and manager really friendly, patient and conversational. Food was served quickly and presented well. Convenient location in Oakville with a lot of parking to access."}
{"text":"Cozy little place in a plaza that also holds a Denny's, Home Depot, and No Frills.   There are 5 tables.  That is all.

I also think I met Pat Morita's doppelg√§nger who seated us and brought our food.  He was friendly and service was perfect.  

We ordered edamame and agadashi tofu to start and the medium roll combo to share for dinner.  Tofu was crispy and tasty and served piping hot.  The edamame was overcooked.  The sushi was fresh and very good.

The elevator music version of David Guetta's Titanium was \"interesting\".

Good place to come for sushi any night the mood strikes!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was excellent! The owner was very helpful and made us feel very welcome. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Oakville. The spicy crispy salmon is absolutely delicious! I usually order that along with veggie tempura or edamame. Not very expensive and portions are good. The staff is super friendly and service is quick. Only downfall is that they do not have a liquor licence.  Very very good!"}
{"text":"Had spicy salmon roll, yam tempura roll and beef roll. It taste pretty good  and I would like to visit here again. I think this restaurant will be one of my favourite sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Now this is what I call a hidden gem!!I was around in Oakville area and looked up on good old faithful YELP for some Japanese options and there popped this place with amazing reviews which I was more that ready/excited to try.

As I walk in this small restaurant more like a take out joint I would say with minimal seating and fairly cute decor, I was welcomed with a smile and was made to sit.Soon came the menu from which I decided to go with shrimp tempura and 4 assorted sushi.

The food came out within no time and was beyond fresh and full of flavors.Without doubt this is the best shrimp tempura I have tasted in a while.The shrimp was fresh and  lightly battered.It was perfectly crunchy and not oily at all.The tempura sauce was light and not overly sodiumized.

Now my assorted sushi were tuna, white tuna, salmon and unagi.All the fish used were immensely fresh and the rice used was of great quality.The sushi was moist unlike many places where it's dry.Also I noticed the size of each sushi was a bit smaller than standardly served at other restaurants which I absolutely had no issue with as long as it was fresh and tasted amazing.

As I was leaving I congratulated the owner for such good food he's offering and also for the wonderful 4.5 stars on Yelp.He politely told me he wasn't too computer/Internet  savvy and smiled.

The restaurant is clean and the service was quick.Every time I'm in Oakville and crave Japanese food I will definitely be pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"THE BEST JAPANESE RESTAURANT IN OAKVILLE! AND ITS ACTUALLY RUN BY JAPANESE, which makes it authentic and really makes me appreciate the culture and food. the quality is amazing, and the price is super affordable. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great service. Not sure what else I can say. Never noticed it tucked in the corner of Trafalgar Village until we searched for sushi in the area on Yelp. Wife had vegetarian bento box, I had sashimi, chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura. All great."}
{"text":"This doesn't look like a mom and pop shop from the outside but walk in and you will quickly be greeted by a sweet older man and woman. I ordered some sashimi and a spicy tuna roll - both of which were nice and fresh. The price was on par with other sushi restaurants, but what made this restaurant stand out was the friendliness of the owners. The older man had just fried up some spring rolls and offered me one, free of charge. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The guys who work here are really great with their customers. My takeout took 10 minutes longer than estimated, and they gave me egg rolls while they caught up, and then sent me home with more egg rolls.

I LOVE their hand rolls. The fish is perfectly seasoned and I believe they blend tempura bits in giving it a lovely crunch. Their fish to rice ratio is so generous, too. I'm not a big fan of California rolls, but their version as a hand roll is beautiful and eye catching.

I found their rice in the sushi rolls to be a little bit harder than I'd like it, the edges were quite crisp compared to my usual sushi place. Then again, I'm picky and would still order here again.

One flaw, I really disliked the tempura vegetables and shrimp. This is always my go to appetizer and this place really failed it. I don't like their choice of batter as it's a bit thin and hard, and the tempura sauce that comes with it is sweet, which is just... wrong. The vegetables that come with it is a bit odd, like two string beans.

The indoors are beautiful with unique seating, and would be a lovely place to eat in. The tables did smell a little strange however.

I hold this location to the same standards as I would a place in Toronto, so while I did like this place I have too many criticisms to give more than 3 stars. While I won't be ordering the tempura again, I will order a hand roll any day as they've almost perfected it. So good!"}
{"text":"I came to Wasabi & Teriyaki for a quick lunch. It's a typical Japanese restaurant in the GTA. Similar rolls and bento boxes. What stands out is ambiance which is relaxing with nice Japanese inspired decor and soothing orchestral music. The staff is very nice and polite. And the food quality is above par.

I ordered their Lover combo 2 which consists of a dynamite roll (crab meat, cucumber, deep fried yam and shrimp, and avocado) and red dragon roll (dynamite roll with salmon on top). It was 10 mouth full sized pieces which wasn't enough for me but my appetite is above average. 
The deep fried shrimp and yam were freshly fried and crispy and not too oily. They were sparring with the spicy mayo which I enjoyed. 

Their wasabi, I think, is actual REAL wasabi that has been freshly ground/grated. It is spicy and tasty. It has a grainy texture as well. 

The price for the 2 rolls and tea is $13 plus tax and tip. It came out to around $17. Quite pricey for the amount of food you get. Comparing to other places serving the same combo at the same price their rolls are around 25% larger but quality may not be as good.

All in all a great place to kill your craving with a good experience. I may come back to try a different lunch set and revisit this review."}
{"text":"great food and one of the best customer service i've ever experienced at a restaurant. definately a hidden treasure in oakville."}
{"text":"This place is small, cute, and decorated in a traditional Japanese style that makes it cozy and inviting. It is a sit-down, waiter-service restaurant but it looks a bit like a fast food place, as you can see from the photos uploaded by other Yelpers. The sushi & sashimi was reasonably priced and very, very fresh. We got a large party tray for take-out and it was ready in about 30 minutes. We will be back for more in the near future. I would definitely recommend this place to the Oakville crowd. Just FYI they only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"I returned with a friend to eat in. The service was great and the food was delicious! The care with which the food is prepared is obvious and you can taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients. 

We loved the atmosphere and the service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"5 stars because the owners are so kind, sushi was great for it's price, and the decorations are on point. There were three of us so the owners gave us a free miso soup as our order only came with two. They also didn't charge us for a bottled water we ordered. My brother tipped 15% though he meant to tip 20%, so he left the additional cash. The humble owners told us to keep it and use it for coffee or whatever we would like. I know it doesn't sound like much but it's the little things that matter to me. 

We ordered the medium sushi love boat, spider roll, and calamari. The sushi is all fresh. The spider roll here was soft as some places can have it rather chewy. My brother's favourite is the spider roll so if he deems it good, then it must be! The deep fried calamari had a nice crispy tempura batter, was thin and tender. The rest of the sushi boat was delicious too. 

They don't accept visa, we had to use debit!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had outside or Toronto. Wonderfully accommodating and friendly staff, and great sushi. My personal favourite is the baked salmon roll. If you're looking for great sushi, look no further."}
{"text":"Even though I got a Togo order the presentation was great. The food is worth it. I was just passing by and wanted something quick to eat and they were fast. And the customer service is amazing. Small place big heart."}
{"text":"Always come here for a la carte. Sushi is very good at fair price and owners are always very friendly."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was hesitant to go to this place, but as my desperate search for cheap and decent sushi in Oakville continues, things are going to get crazy. 

Wasabi & Teriyaki has the most unassuming storefront I have ever seen. It basically could be a car parts store from the front - white sign with plain blue letters, really nothing fancy, and part of the reason I hesitated to go there - it just doesn't look quite right. 

Upon entering, we were the only patrons in the restaurant and there were no staff to be seen - red flag, red flag! But still, we pursued, and found a server who was quite apologetic and quickly seated us. 

It's more of a \"fast food\" style restaurant, with pictures of items on a board behind the bar and a very small seating area. 

We were offered tea or water, and chose tea. It came in a personal pot brewed for us, and made me feel a little more at ease. We both ordered combos, myself the \"california roll and dynamite roll\" but I also was able to try the \"udon and spicy salmon roll\" ordered by my dining mate. The food came quickly and was surprsingly quite good! The rolls were fresh and good, and the udon was a little plain but definitely nothing to complain about. 

During this time two things happened that I thought were weird: one, we decided we wanted water and bottled water was brought over. They said they don't have other water and we won't be charged. But.. how did they make my soup? How could bottled water possibly be cost effective?? The other thing that annoyed me was that the chef who dropped off our food, noted how big my meal was and was all surprised that I was going to eat it. Guess what. I can eat two sushi rolls no problem. I could probably eat twice that amount of food if I really wanted to, and commenting on it doesn't make me feel better! 

Besides those two strange moments, I actually had a decent sushi meal and a good price, for the first time in Oakville! Is this better than my usual spots in Toronto, no - but I'm adjusting my expectations and I will be back."}
{"text":"This resto is such a hole in the wall with other huge chain stores around it that you'd never suspect a restaurant like this to be here. 

Walking in on a Wednesday afternoon with my friend it was empty. There's seating for approximately 4 tables so I believe this is mainly a takeout place. 

The chef did everything from seating us, serving us, and obviously creating these masterpieces on the table. 

The chef I haven't decided if I really liked or aggressively neutral about. He came by to take our orders and I ordered the Japanese spicy ramen first. I was trying to order a spicy salmon roll but he took my menu before I could and he's like, \"no, the noodles will be enough. You won't finish.\"  I assured him I would and ordered my spicy salmon against his wishes (and I finished it!). 

My friend had the spicy tuna and Philadelphia roll. 

I was so amazed when the food came. My roll actually had the filling (as extra) on top!!! I've never seen any restaurant do this. The rice to fish ratio was perfect and tasted amazing. 

The noodles I was slightly put off by. The heat level was great but it honestly tasted like instant noodles I boil at home. 

I'll definitely be back for the rolls and try their sushi but will skip the noodles next time."}
{"text":"I was impressed the first time I came so I decided to bring my parents here. This second time I was disappointed. I called to make reservations since I knew there are only 5 tables, he asked me what time then proceeded to say they don't take reservations, which is fine but when we got there the place was completely empty so I'm not sure what the problem was. 

I said a lot of good things to my parents so I wanted to make sure I ordered something good for them. When he came around the cook which was also whom I spoke to on the phone he walked away seemingly annoyed since I said I needed a few more minutes. Sushi was good but not as good as the last time I was there, miso soup on the salty side, tempura was nicely fried not super oily, but I still have yet to receive  these complimentary spring rolls other people speak about. Overall the food is good. Not very happy with the service."}
