{"text":"The best customer service I've ever experienced at a Vietnamese restaurant. I got the combination pho and it was probably the best I've ever eaten. The owners were very welcoming and made sure that we had everything we needed. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the pho, broth was so aromatic and flavorful, and not too salty. They know what they're doing. Looking forward to trying the other fare."}
{"text":"We came in on Sunday and it was really hot inside.  They have completely turned off the air conditioner to save on cost.  This might be a health hazard because the temperature of the food might not be up to code.  This was our 3rd visit and we were hoping that the A/C problem would be resolved but it was not.  They said that management is not working with them to resolve the problem.  Perhaps they can get their money back for renting the space and find a new location that has air condition.  We ordered the hot soup and pho.  It good but a little too much fish sauce inside both broths.  We also ordered the rice noodle bowl and the meat was a little too salty.  This is probably because of previous reviews from other customers complaining that their food is bland.  Their food is good here.  Just wish that they would cut back on the fish sauce just a little.  Very nice couple and family oriented.  Hope this does not offend them.  Just a few suggestions to make this place perfect.  Thanks-Nick"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've had in Vegas no lie. I'm from the bay, so that's saying a lot. Tried my first Vietnamese curry and I have to say that it was the tastiest curry I've ever had. Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Food was great, friendly service. So glad it's close by home. They just opened and it can get busy, so u may wait a bit longer, but believe me it's worth the wait.  Stop reading and just go there now!"}
{"text":"Best crab ragoons, and it's really cheap. The pho is awesome especially the broth of the beef combination pho. It's just missing tripe. Also the grilled pork banh mi is awesome and even their fried rice."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the northwest and were headed down to Lake Mead because there is no Vietnamese near us and found this place on Google so we tried it. We actually stopped in on their first day open. The food was excellent! I had the beef pho and it had great flavor with a perfect balance of seasoning. The beef was good, I didn't get any chewy pieces like at some places. The soup stayed hot till the last bite. The owner said they heat the noodles so it doesn't bring down the temp of the soup. My husband had a noodle and tofu dish that came with surprisingly tasty house-made fish sauce. We also had the crab rangoons and spring rolls and loved them.  The owners are very friendly. Prices were good. We are so happy there is really good Vietnamese in the north part of the valley finally! We will definitely go here from now on."}
{"text":"The food is very good and fresh. The owners are very helpful and made the visit a very pleasant experience. We will definitely come back before we journey back to South Carolina."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this restaurant. It had simple decor but the food is very flavorful!  I ordered the well done beef pho my husband ordered the #4 something spicy soup. We both enjoyed it very much. The broth was on point. I will be coming here again. Glad they open a Vietnamese restaurant near me. Don't have to travel very far for good Pho!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the  delicious soup and flan. We hope you guys will gradually expand. Will surely come back!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to rate this place, because I have never ate the food. They have never given me the opportunity. I have showed up 3 times at 7pm after I get out of work. Each time they have closed early before there supposed to be 9pm closing time.  3 times I have called with no answer, but an answering machine that says we're open till 9pm. And three times I have walked in to them saying sorry were closed, well they are sitting around a table with more customers at the door.   At least answer your phone. Your sitting right there and tell me your not open and save me the drive.  If I could give this review ZERO stars I would. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst bun bo hue I've ever had! First of all, the noodles were completely the WRONG noodles. They used the thin vermicelli noodles instead of thick noodles. Not sure if they ran out of the thick noodles and went with an alternative but it was completely wrong--I've never had bun bo hue served this way. Also the broth was incredibly bland. Absolutely no flavor and it wasn't spicy at all. When I asked for some sate (Vietnamese chili sauce), they said they didn't have any. What kind of Vietnamese restaurant serves bun bo hue and DOESN'T carry sate?!? My friend ordered pho and it was below average. It was definitely better than what I got but it wasn't great either.  They also served eggrolls without any lettuce / herbs to wrap it with--a big no-no if you are used to literally every Vietnamese restaurant doing so.  Also the owner came around to talk to us like we've never had Vietnamese food in our lives (I am 100% Vietnamese) and talked up his restaurant so much as if everything they had to offer was the most amazing food we would ever have. It was pretty annoying and a complete let down after having him talk up the food so much.  Just to give a frame of reference, I am originally from San Jose, CA and used to delicious Vietnamese home cooking and all the Vietnamese restaurants in my area knowing exactly what they're doing. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before going here but I just badly wanted some noodle soup and this was the closest place. I hardly write Yelp reviews but I felt like I had to after my experience here. I hope the owner doesn't take this as an insult but improves on the food to make it a better business. In the meantime, I would recommend going to spring mountain road for legit viet food."}
{"text":"I love it! My husband and I tried for the first time and guess what? Went back for more the next day!Really nice people, great service, and most of all GREAT FOOD. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place, was first time having pho ever! And it's my new fav and fav place and it's less than 10 min drive which is also a plus don't have drive all way to spring mtn, the ginger marinated chicken wings recommend also, server was also helpful explaining everything, I already want more!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pho place. The broth was super clean. Not like a light flavorless broth, but packed with flavor and clean. You know how some pho broths are a little salty to give that extra flavor? I feel like this has less sodium and more of a something else that gives it a little extra oomph.   Then there are the noodles. Most places give you what I can only assume was a brick of noodles immediately before it went into the bowl. You gave to break them apart before you can even start to eat them. The noodles here are loose like you would find attached a ramen place where you can see the chef cook them. Texture and size were perfect.   Finally the steak. Pro tip: ask for the rare steak on the side. It's an order of magnitude better. This place gives you a great cut of meat. The steak is a deep red rather than the pink you often find.   Overall, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pho so 1 has the best pho in town to me. This restaurants pho is on beginners level. I was disappointed. Only got two slices of steak meat, no stripes, 3 jalepinos, the noodles were not typical pho noodles, no hoisin or saratcha sauce. Just nasty won't be eating here again"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. It's close by, I don't have to drive far to get a great bowl of pho. The flan was also delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I have really liked everything I have had. I also tasted the food everyone else in my party ordered and I would order any of them again. I originally came in for the Pho but the other dishes were so good, I am having a hard time choosing now. Good portions. Extremely sweet family owners."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have been to and probably becoming my favorite spot. The food is extremely tasty and service is excellent!!!! Definitely recommend this place to EVERYONE!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our foods from our last visit few weeks back. Love their noodles and their rolls,but sorry I forgot the names that was on the menu. We had great service as well."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was below average, i did not get a single refill on my drink, plus they had like a child as one of their servant...wtf?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food. If you like Vietnamese food you have to try this place out!"}
{"text":"I'll get to the point. Place looks clean. Modern. Staff... Friendly. Food..Pretty good. Flavorful. Fresh ingredients.  Spring Rolls....Not the best that I've had. PHO....Taste like the typical PHO. Nothing unique or special.   Probably one of the best PHO place in the North Part of town.. Will I return? Yes!"}
{"text":"Really nice pho and nice rice noodle, the environment is nice and clean. we found this restaurant from Yelp, and very enjoy it, thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the best best best place!! The pho is amazing! I haven't found a place in Vegas yet that compares."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and it did not disappoint. Staff were very accommodating. It's a family-owned restaurant and even the kids try to help giving out the menu. If you're new to eating Vietnamese food they are more than happy to recommend what's good on their menu. Everything we tried on their menu was delicious.  For the appetizers, we got the fresh spring rolls and sandwich- both tasted awesome. For our meals, owner recommended Bo Kho which is a beef stew - it comes with a bread to dip in the soup. It is a good alternate if you are fond of pho soups. Very tasty and a lot of flavors all in one bowl. Since I can't eat any meat for the lenten season, they recommended the shrimp fried rice which was equally delicious and satisfying.  This place has a homy feel to it that even the chef went out to talk to us and made sure that we were satisfied with our meals.  Will definitely recommend this to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"First time visiting Sunflower and we had a good experience. The menu is small compare to other Vietnamese places but it delivers. We got the veggie and shrimp pho and they were delicious. We loved the service more than anything else. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"TRY! TRY! TRY! I love that I finally found a delicious Vietnamese spot on my side of town! Very new spot, I love how clean it is, very pretty bar area if you want to dine for one. Very friendly. I'm sick and the owner recommended the prefect soup! I will definitely be coming back.!"}
{"text":"Really good wholesome pho place in the northwest! I had the well done beef , the broth was aromatic and clear.   Also had the crispy egg rolls, wrapped tight and fried crisp to perfection.   This restaurant is family owned with lots of attention to detail. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I would always come here when the old owner was here. This place still has very good pho. Place is clean and very friendly staff. Glad this place is still open in north Vegas"}
{"text":"Daughter and I went to this new pho place on Craig and Valley to see if it was a place that we would want to go to again. The restaurant was welcoming but I didn't like the Buddhist shrine on the floor. It made me feel weird walking close to it. The place was clean and the staff was friendly and courteous.   We ordered two bowls of pho, the combination one was $9.50 but didn't have the tendons,  tripes or brisket meat. The other bowl was $8.50 for a meat pho. The broth was really good. It lacked the chili paste or chili to add to the pho. I didn't care for the chopsticks, it was like the ones you get from a Chinese takeout places. I preferred real chopsticks or the ones that are longer. I just wish they would have a large and small bowl, otherwise it wouldn't get a \"4\" star. I would rather have a Vietnamese restaurant like the ones in Chinatown.   I would recommend anyone to try it out, pho was really good but had small amount of noodles. I like it because it's close to my house, but I still want it to be competitive with the other pho restaurant in town. I know they are catering to less Asian population over here but there are a lot of people who know what to expect from a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was really good! With that being said, it seems like they're a bit understaffed. Overall great!"}
{"text":"The place has only been opened for barely 2 months, so some of the interior is still under construction/remodeling. However, the atmosphere is already nice and cozy. I'm sure once they fully refurnish the place it will be even nicer. It is a small family owned restaurant so you might see some kids running around and playing in the back which didn't bother me. Their older daughter waited on my fiancé and I and she was very attentive and sweet. My fiancé got vermicelli noodles with lemongrass chicken. I got beef stew with toasted bread. Both dishes were flavorful. Portion was pretty good size, price was reasonable and service was great. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great little family owned restaurant. We've been here two times so far. The owner is extremely nice and very attentive. The food was delicious, we tried something new both times we came: beef ho, bun bo hue, vermicelli noodles, goi cuon, chicken wings, and limeade. Service has been great."}
{"text":"Friggin delicious. Got the combination Pho amd the Bbq Pork Banh Mi. We cleaned our plates. Will be returning periodcially haha"}
{"text":"New place on the North side of town. This is your best bet if you're looking for pho without having to go to Chinatown. Sunflower is a small restaurant with 7 tables that seat 4 and can be moved together for bigger groups. They also have seating for 15 up at the bar.  They offer the standard faire of spring rolls, pho,, vermicelli bowls, sandwiches,  and rice dishes. I had my usual of fresh spring rolls and chicken pho. The broth was very tasty and plenty of chicken pieces.   The staff are all very friendly and attentive. I will make a trip here again for sure. Keep in mind they are closed on Tuesday but open every other day until 9pm."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. Cute family owned place.  Their older daughter took our order (adorable), and their youngest daughter running out with our drinks/appetizer/napkins (super adorable). The pho broth is pretty good, had more of a real beef flavor which I prefer and the beef was really good. My friend ordered the Beef Stew with a roll on the side and it was AMAZING. Super addicting. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I only come here to get number 9 on the menu. The pho was the best tastiest pho I've had. I will come back and order the same thing again and again. It's that good! Family owned business and they were very polite."}
{"text":"Tried thus place out for first time. Owner is very outgoing and tries to interact with you my making suggestions and try to get you to try something different. I ordered Pho even after his suggestion to try something different. I was not too impressed with in. It was just ok. It was a bit bland and wasn't digging that it didn't come with red onion. It's close and convinient but not sure that I will try again"}
{"text":"I came in not really hungry and a bit sorry for that, in that there was something good cooking in the back. I ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls, not hungry? I ordered two portions of it. It was okay, the owners made up for the 20%. I gave the place five stars because I and the other guests agreed that the owners were very nice and friendly. One of the people inside loved the number 8, which was a rice dish, I will have to try it tomorrow."}
{"text":"First the decor in the restaurant was \"what is on sale at Walmart meets china town\". But hey. It works. Kinda.   Place is clean. Service is pretty good. Now to the food Egg rolls are crispy and good flavor. But they don't come with the traditional lettuce to wrap them and cilantro and fish sauce. It comes with sweet Thai chili sauce. And pickled veggies. (Not homemade ). They were not bad. Not great. The pho had a little bit of a sweet flavor. I would suspect from the fish sauce they use. Good amount of broth and noodles but lacking a little on the meat. Overall. Not my favorite. I eat pho probably 2-3 times a week and always try the new places. But I don't know if I would go back. Not horrible. Just not my style."}
{"text":"Yesterday I came in for my first time happy and left happy. Today, I came in happy and left happy again. That's all I ever ask for in a restaurant is to be considerate and to be interactive with their customers. - Their pho 1A is well prepped and way better than most pho I have had in Las Vegas because the quality is there. It's a very welcoming atmosphere. I thank Myles and his family for a great dinner two days in a row and more to come!"}
{"text":"Tried the #4 pho and spring rolls. The pho was ok, I'm used to eating pho on spring mountain (best in my opinion pho so 1) and I can really tell the difference. This pho isnt the same, it was missing taste. (More cilantro helps) The spring rolls were loose, but tasted like any other spring rolls, i would have liked them tighter so they didn't spill as much. Overall the check came out to $16ish with a Coke.. *pho so 1 is $21 for the same thing, but the taste is better and more authentic. At the end of the day this is the closest pho to my house without having to drive down to the strip. The girl at the front was very nice, helpful and attentive. Great place! Just not as good as the places on spring mountain, but beggers can't be choosers. Gotta have my pho fix and this hits the spot well enough"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas. Very impressed with the authentic taste and service is excellent. So happy it's on the north side of town."}
{"text":"This place is great! Amazing quality food, really nice service and the employees have a lot of in depth information on the menu. One of the best pho places around in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and it's been really delicious every single time.  Really friendly staff every time we come in. One guy even talked to us about Pokémon go because he saw us playing it, and gave us some local tips(we visit from out of town).  The pho and Vietnamese iced coffee are always great. We hit this place up every time we're in town, and will make sure to do so in the future."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean. The staff very friendly and welcoming. The owers gave some great recommendations. We actually stopped by just for Pho, and the other dishes sounded so good we had to try them. Everything was delicious. The ingredients are very fresh and the food had alot of flavor. Definitely a place you have to try.  We will be back to try the other dishes!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate a Sunflowers Vietnamese Restaurant today... very good  the PHO  was very tasty  the atmosphere was very nice ... we both give it 2  thumbs up.. and we'll be back"}
{"text":"Probably the best Pho I've had in Las Vegas. The appetizers were all delicious too. Highly recommend this place to anyone, this place deserves the spotlight. Owner is super friendly and helpful too!!"}
{"text":"Pho was amazing. Beef Stew was amazing. BBQ Pork Sandwich was amazing! Refreshing prices when all these other Vietnamese places keep raising theirs. The place is also very clean"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based off reviews. The service was phenomenal. Got the spring rolls and regular flank pho. They have both the hot pepper oil and sauce. Definitely going to be coming back."}
{"text":"I was hoping to like this new Pho restaurant but couldn't. The portions are small, the broth has no depth of flavor and the noodles are mushy. The service however was very friendly. Will continue to trek down to Pho 90 or Saigon 8 for my pho fix."}
{"text":"My family and I are super happy to have found a Vietnamese restaurant so close to home. We found this gem thanks to Yelp! The owner was a great guy, even gave a quick rundown of the menu items. We ordered: grilled pork banh mi, vermicelli bowl with 3 items and no peanut (egg roll, grilled pork and fried tofu), pho (item 1a... I totally forgot all the cuts of meat in there), pork and shrimp spring roll with no crushed peanut in the peanut sauce and Vietnamese limeade. My only complaint was not leaving enough room in my belly to try their flan! There was another customer raving about how delicious it was when she had it on a different visit. I personally had the vermicelli bowl and the freshness of the veggies was very evident. The egg roll was crispy with flavorful filling. The tofu was fried perfectly and the grilled pork was obviously marinated well and grilled perfectly. The pork was moist! I tried a few scoops of the broth from my sisters pho and the depth of flavor was deff there. My hubby wrote his own review on the restaurant and his banh mi, giving it 5 stars! The spring rolls were yum.... and the limeade was absolutely fresh and perfect for these hot Vegas summers! I can't wait to come back and grub some more!"}
{"text":"My son and I checked out this location since I'm always on the hunt for good Vietnamese food near my home. Environment is clean and the service is fast. My son and I loved our food. We order soup and meat pies, and I took the grilled pork chop with fried rice home to my husband. The food is good. Stop by and check this place out."}
{"text":"I love pho, and I was just about to order my usual (shrimp pho) when the waiter suggested the a spice beef stew noodle (bo kho.) Tried it, LOVED IT. I'm glad I didn't get my usual. Also their spring rolls packed a bigger flavor than other places. Also got the crab rangoons, they are made fresh. The service was very friendly and personal. This will be a regular spot of mine."}
{"text":"Great place. Owner is awesome and very nice. Family ran place. The wife is also very cool  kids are cute. Food is fantastic and not pricy. Pho is spot on. Bah MI is legit too. Try the lemonade"}
{"text":"this place is family owned. Really good pho - and really good. the Bahn Mi sandwiches are way good. Bathroom is clean, place is clean. Owner is really friendly and will tell you stories and what not if you ask. very nice guy. The wife is nice also, they always chat with us when we visit. I recommend the sparkling lime-aid they make in house."}
{"text":"Delightful neighborhood cuisine did not have reservations seated promptly good choices on menu"}
{"text":"Had pho here, it was really good. The owner is super nice, service was great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Food is awesome and service is absolutely phenomenal!!!! Such a cute place. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pho, friendly service, reasonable prices. Great to have a place like this in NW part of town!  Will deft be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out and it was honestly pretty good!! I loooooove food and pho is one of my favs, so I know what good pho tastes like and this place has great pho"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp Vermicelli rice noodle bowl and the coffee flan! Amazing service and the food was magical!!"}
{"text":"This is a place you must go to!!  Everyone is so inviting and friendly. The Pho is fantastic!! It's my new spot in NLV"}
{"text":"Decent place to go if you're in the area. Counter was a little dirty, service was slow I had to get someone's attention in order to get more water or more napkin, the little girl who works there needs to smile more if she is taking customers orders and also you shouldn't ask for cash if the customer wants to pay with a credit card instead."}
{"text":"Came here today at 1130am. It was dead inside since they open at 11. The waitress was super sweet and friendly. I got the rare steak pho and Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk. Both were very good. The broth was delicious and the food came out quickly. I only wish the pho had more meat in it. I would definitely come back here and recommend."}
{"text":"Finally finally finally...... We have great Pho on the north side. No longer do we have to go to China town...we had several items off the menu and all were super fresh and tasty...Pho is all about the broth and sunflower does it right...we'll be back"}
{"text":"I am so Grateful for this small piece of heaven!! The owners are amazing they always greet us with a smile. The FOOD OMG THE FOOD!! I highly recommend ALL OF THE BANH MI SANDWICHES!! The Bun Bo Hue- Hot Soup is so flavorful and fulfilling with a Da Chanh- Vietnamese Limade carbonated I have been here 5 times withing 2 weeks. I will be coming as long as I am on this earth and they are open!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love pho, but hate making the trip to spring mountain. Glad this place opened up, since it cuts my drive time like crazy and the quality is fantastic.   Right when you walk in, the decor is nice for a small pho shop. Way better than the other pho restaurants around the area, where you walk in and question whether you should eat there or not. The service is great as well! The owners will make recommendations which is awesome.  The soup base is amazing here. It stays hot and consistent. The taste is a lot cleaner tasting than the other pho spots. The meat is also fresh and well cooked.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The beef stew was fabulous!  The lime aid is awesome...Must try.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"We were HUGE fans of the original Sunflower, but once they were purchased by another owner the quality definitely went down. We have been here twice now since the change in ownership. The pho is average - certainly not bad, but also nothing particularly awesome. The pork sandwich is pretty good! The two servers are really nice. Biggest downside is that we have found a total of three hairs in our food between two visits. Very disappointing to have it happen twice in a row!"}
{"text":"We started going to this place immediately after it opened and are now definitely regulars - we go every week! We pretty routinely ate pho in Chinatown until we found this place and now go here instead. Myles and his wife know our usual orders and we have tried tons of things on the menu. Personal favorites are the rare beef pho and the pork chop and I am obsessed with the Vietnamese iced coffee and limade. The pho broth is the best we have been able to find in Vegas, very hearty. The meat is sliced thin, which I love, and for me seems to be the right amount. Prices seem very reasonable.  This is a family owned and operated business and it is clear that the owner takes a lot of pride in teaching his young children about the business. The kids are usually playing quietly in the corner. His oldest daughter sometimes will bring out the menus and take drink orders. I noticed a few reviews talking about how the owner explains or even over-explains items on the menu. We have not had this happen at all but even if we had, I think it is better than having a server leave you wondering what foods are. He is great at answering questions, making recommendations, and teaching us a little about the dish and the culture."}
{"text":"We're a big fan of this place. It's clean,the food is good,and the people are friendly! We always get the Pho and it's been amazing.  I always get some sandwiches to go for lunch the next day and they have been delicious every time! This is our go to spot for some good food!"}
{"text":"Their pho is amazing! It's great that we can get this in north las vegas instead of driving to spring mountain!!  We also got the fried rice and eggrolls. Everything is good!!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The pho here is amazing! The broth is full of flavor!! My daughter had the lemonade with club soda, it was delicious. Recommend that for sure and their Thai coffee."}
{"text":"Was so grateful to finally have a Vietnamese Restaurant open near me. I don't have to go to the Southwest side of town anymore. There food is excellent along with the service and the staff. They also have one of my favorites the sandwiches. There prices are very reasonable. Anyone living in North Las Vegas NV needs to try them out. I will be a regular customer of there's."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful delicious dinner. Between a friend and myself, we tried the Vietnamese sandwich, vermicelli noodle bowl and the pho beef soup with rare beef and it was all very good. Will definitely return for more"}
{"text":"Ordered take out which was pretty good overall. Food was flavorful and ingredients fresh enough. Take out pho can be dicey since they have to separate everything out and you put it together when you get home. So, my rare steak wasn't so rare but it was still tasty. You can only order one size so if you're hungry you might have get some other things or a double order.  Got away with two Pho and two appetizers for $27.  The restaurant looked nice and the staff was friendly. Not any pho places in Centennial so this was the closest to me and I thought it was better than Pho Kim Long in China town or Pho Rose in Summerlin.  Will definitely go back for dine in."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The pho is delicious and quite a large portion. The eggrolls were sooo good and the customer service was the best I've ever had. Its clean and the staff is super friendly! I won't remove a star but the pho has a hefty amount of noodles compared to the meat portion and I personally like a lot of meat. I'll definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"The pho was \"ok\"...my biggest concern is only getting 3 fu***n shrimp for 2.00. When I can get a whole pound at a store for 6.00. 25/30 pieces minimum. That's a straight rip off."}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant is very nice. Everything is brand new and there is a lot of seating available.  When we walked in the Owner (I'm assuming) was at the end of the bar, helping another customer at the cash register. He shouted at us to take a seat where ever.  After we sat down, we received our menus. We usually order the same thing every time we go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Either the beef (& tripe for me, if they have it - they did not have it here :() pho or the vermicelli noodle salad. Since this spot is 'hot & new' we decided to order one bowl of pho & one bowl of vermicelli noodle salad & shared them so we both could try our favorite dishes here. We also always choose spring rolls for our appetizer.   Number one annoying thing: the owner kept trying to upsell us and acted like we knew nothing about Vietnamese cuisine. He kept talking about how good the bun bo hue and the beef stew were. He even went into explaining WHAT they both were, in great detail, as if I'd never tried the dishes before. I think he should ask first \"have you ever had Bun Bo Hue or Beef Stew before?\" If the answer is no then maybe go on with your explanation if the answer is yes, maybe keep it to \"well ours is amazing, I highly recommend it.\" No matter what he said to us, we were not changing our minds for our order. When I tried to order my spring rolls, he cut me off and suggested their chicken wings. They sounded good but I had my heart set on spring rolls. When I said \"ooh sounds good!\" He started writing it down on his pad as if I agreed to ordering them, I had to stop him and say \"maybe next time but this time we want the spring rolls.\" Then he started going off about all the great drinks he had and when he said Vietnamese Limeade, I exclaimed \"yum!\" then he says, \"carbonated or non-carbonated?\" I was about to tell him we didn't actually want it but my boyfriend decided it did sound good and said \"yeah we'll have a limeade\" He chose carbonated.  The spring rolls were extremely skinny and the wrap was very hard.   The beef in the pho and the noodle salad were sliced into the tiniest, thinnest pieces I've ever seen. The egg rolls in the noodle salad were just bad... they tasted old & the flavor was really off. There wasn't much shrimp either but the ones that were there were extremely dry. The sauce for the noodle salad was too bland. I had to put an extreme amount of sriracha for any type of flavor in the pho broth, as well. The noodles in the pho were so soft & soggy, they were falling apart. I could have ate it all with a spoon.   The limeade was really good and refreshing. But, I saw him use Coffee Mate Creamer in their Vietnamese coffee so I didn't & would never order it. (It is supposed to be sweetened condensed milk, trust me!)   Annoying thing number two: my boyfriend is white. Asian restaurants always try to offer him a fork, but I taught him a long time ago how to properly use chopsticks! So usually he just denies the fork offer. This time, she said \"you need a fork\" in a \"I'm telling you\" way, instead of asking, she just sets it down. Then she goes on & tells him to rip his mint leaves into little pieces so it will taste better...... We both love whole mint leaves.... & he kept saying \"ok\" but she wouldn't leave until he actually ripped them into little pieces like she suggested. I am surprised she didn't just tell him to take them out & assume he didn't like them at all. (My mom did this once to him & made him a bunch of mint-less spring rolls, lol)    I really think they should ask questions & not assume they know everything about everyone. & go ahead & suggest your favorite items on the menu but don't make the customers feel like crap because they don't order what you suggest. & the food quality & quantity is just all too low..."}
{"text":"We finally have a great Vietnamese restaurant in North Las Vegas.        They have the most amazing Jumbo Chicken Wings. You can tell that they made them from scratch (not from frozen) and to order. You will never want to eat wings anywhere else, especially once you dip the wings in the house made fish sauce. You need to try their Vietnamese Iced Coffee it's the best I ever had. Last but not least, they have some amazing Pho.       If you love food made fresh when you order it, this is the place for you. I can't what to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"Great all around. Food is delicious, the owners are friendly. Comfortable atmosphere. Definitely coming again"}
{"text":"1. Terrible customer service 2. The servers don't listen to their customer's orders. 3. They Continuously walk pass customer who have been waiting 15 mins just to give an order. 4. The servers bring out the INCORRECT order TWICE with dirty napkins. 5. Got charged for an INCORRECT order. I must say, I never leave reviews, and this is my first. Damn."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service. Food is very reasonably priced. My favorite thing to eat here is the bbq pork sandwich and the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Best Pho I have had in the north area. The family owned restaurateur are really nice and welcoming.  All the food items where all freshly made to order!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! This is as authentic as it gets considering the chef is from Viet Nam!   Their pho, and the broth in particular, is superior to every other Vietnamese restaurant I've tried in the valley. All the other places have let me down when compared to Sunflower! Having spent a decent amount of time in Viet Nam myself, this is the only place that tastes authentic to me. I've ordered their pho many times, both dine-in and take-out prepared at home, and it always tastes the same and it is perfect.   Their banh mi sandwiches are delicious too. They make a butter in house that they put on the sandwiches that is sooo good. And the way they marinate the meat is perfect - I have yet to find better ones anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This is now officially one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in Vegas. The inside is very clean and modern. There was about 3-4 other groups there during week day lunch hour. To start we all shared a hot tea ($1.50) which was good but had bits of tea...needles? in it that I had to keep spitting out. I had the Bun Bo Hue, a spicy noodle soup with beef and pork loaf. Pork loaf is.. interesting. It has the texture of fish cake and I assume the process to make it is similar. It didn't have a very strong taste and they give you a ton of slices but I couldn't manage to eat more than one or two. For this reason I wish they offered a vegetarian option but overall it was a good dish.   My coworkers had the Bun Xao and we all tried the BBQ pork banh mi. The Bun Xao looked and smelled delicious though I didn't get a taste. Definitely trying that next time. The BBQ pork looked a lot more appetizing than my pork loaf :( The banh mi was seriously awesome. It was stuffed with ingredients unlike other pho places in the area and they give you a big portion for the price. (I think it was $4.50 or something). I could easily grab one of these to go for a quick lunch.  Update: I've now found my favorite dish here and it's the tofu and vegetable pho. I get this pretty much everywhere but Sunflower has elevated my expectations. They don't just stick sliced tofu in the soup, they have what looks and tastes like marinated seitan, though I'm not positive it is. Either way it's so good. In addition they give you deep fried bean curd slices, shiitake mushrooms, carrot, zucchini, squash, and cabbage. It's like they actually care about the quality of vegetables they're serving you! The shiitake and bean curd add an umami that I've never had in pho and I'm in love. It's hearty and delicious and I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me from Yelp as new business near me so I stopped by. It's a family owned business and I like that aspect but our waitress was a 10 year old and a 3 year old set our menus out. I don't think that's legal but it's cute as a family owned business I guess. The food was mediocre could've made a better meal at my house, and we did mention it to our server and she just said \"sorry\" and kept walking.  If you're looking for a pho spot this isn't probably what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. Food is outstanding. Can't say enough good things about the menu. Lucky to have such a great spot in the neighborhood.  Frequent customer. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"#veryfriendlywelcome #greatfood&greatservice #ihighlyrecommendthisplace #foodtastedawesome #goodportion #morefoodthaniexpected #greatprice #displace"}
{"text":"Wow - some of the best Pho I've had in Las Vegas - the brother is spectacular and the fish sauce is perfect. If you cant tell by the picture. Really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"The second we walked in we we're greeted by one of the friendly staff. They had Excellenct customer service. Fast service and food was great! Will definitely see us again!"}
{"text":"Took them about 10 minutes to get us water and then another 15 minutes passed and nobody came to our table to take our order. We asked the server for a Mango Smoothie, he said \"sorry, it takes 2 long to make it!!!\", we paid for the drinks then left.  I love Phõ, but def won't be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great food comes with great service. I ordered the beef combo and the broth has great flavor  and not watered down, also ordered the spring rolls but its a little thin. The owner is very friendly and very welcoming."}
{"text":"It's nice to have pho back in the NW. The place is relatively new but they know what they're doing. Great service. Friendly staff. Try this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"BEWARE!  My wife and I decided to try this place one more time since its close to where we live.  We were greeted and sat by a 11 year girl.  She also took our drink orders and our food order. THERE WAS 0 ADULT SUPERVISION.  We never saw any adults until after we ordered.  Well my wife's Pho came back shrimp instead of rare beef.  The owner/father Myles started to argue about who got the order wrong...He yelled at his daughter for not repeating the order...At this point I told my wife lets just leave but she was worried that Myles will yell at his 11 year old daughter again or worse if we leave because he will blame her for us leaving.  So we stayed and paid full price for low quality food and so an 11 year old girl would not suffer.  How uncomfortable would you feel???  OMG  Myles kept asking what's wrong and well its not what you ask, its HOW you ask it.  We were talked to like we never had Vietnamese food...very rude.  He is very \"in your face\" type of talker.  This place is probably almost bankrupt since they can't afford any staff and are using their child as the hostess...its just so sad. Thank goodness for child labor laws huh?"}
{"text":"Very very good food.. price is great.. server was very helpful and kind.. Will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in Vegas and I don't have to drive down to spring mountain. The broth is so rich and full of flavor I couldn't eat my bowl any faster. The owner, Miles, was very passionate about his food when he explained the items on the menu to us. Before we even started eating, he explained the AC situation so we looked past it; we didn't even think it was hot inside. Come in, introduce yourself, eat the food, and I'm sure you'll end up a regular just like my friend and I.  10/10 would recommend. Thanks, Miles."}
{"text":"There pho was so far the best I've had in Vegas  I'll definitely be back to try out more things on the Menu."}
{"text":"A really great discovery. We have been there two times in the past week. The spicy beef bowl was awesome. The number 23 dish was also awesome."}
{"text":"Comparing the two owners I would have to say it's very similar in food quality when it comes to the pho. The spring rolls were super delicious and the sandwiches were really good. I would come back. We enjoyed the second experience better than the first."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered the Banh Mi & Beef as my choice of meat.  Banh Mi had a lot of flavors ! Only thing I can say is wish there was more filling of the banh mi which is why I gave 4 stars.  Baguette was very nice and fresh. Meat was seasoned well with picked vegetables."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after Pho Ranch closed down for the 2nd time and I'm sad to say the broth in the pho contains far too much ginger for my taste. We did try some samples of the egg rolls which were good though. Fairly priced. Nice staff. Clean establishment."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. It's near our home. We Had pho here and fried rice. I will definitely be back here again to eat. You won't be disappointed. People are friendly and it's clean."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The Pho is really good. I also ordered a sandwich and am torn between which one I like better. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time here with my family. The staffs are friendly and quick with the services. My two favorites dishes here are Hue Style Spicy Beef and Pho. I highly recommend those two. The sandwiches are also delicious, especially the BBQ Pork. The restaurant setup is really clean and neat- beautiful ! I will definitely  come back whenever I crave for Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Loved that is family business and the food ahhh my delicious never wright a review but I had to this was the Best Vietnamese food I've ever had since I moved 10 years ago from California by far the Best thank you for the service and food"}
{"text":"The pho was ok, it was missing something in the broth. I can't put my finger on it, but I've had better. I had to add a lot of limes and pepper just to get some flavor to it."}
{"text":"Food is always good, super clean and great service. Visited this location several times and always consistent. Starting to become a regular now, especially with the lack of options in North Vegas."}
{"text":"Found a delicious spot in Craig RD. Closest Pho to our house. Pho was so fresh and tasty. Ambience and service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place that recently opened because it is a new Vietnamese place and they have Pho.  I happened to be the only person in the restaurant and had a good conversation with the owner. Business is picking up for them. As long as they keep putting out good food I will be there.   The owner recommends the beef stew. I will have to try that next time. Thanks for a good meal."}
{"text":"I was here a week ago for a quick lunch date with my husband. Definitely was impressed by the recommendation I was given. I had the crispy noodles with like a stir fry veggies with chicken in the middle. I didn't even mind that they had forgotten the shrimp I asked to be added in(it wasn't in our bill either, so I'm good).  I was super hungry that I almost finished it all considering it was a bigger portion than I expected, but it was that good. I added some lime juice with it and that came out even better. I would definitely order that again, but seeing that the recommendation came out really tasty, I would get whatever they recommend the next time we come in. This place is going to be our regular go to dining. My husband got the pho soup and he said it was a lot tastier than the other place we go to. Plus point on not being greasy."}
{"text":"We live in Centennial Hills and wanted Pho, so we used Yelp and found Sunflower Vietnamese restaurant.  I got take out, two orders of Rare steak Pho, and two pork spring roll (vietnames taco, fried). To be honest i was a little unsure because nobody was in the restaurant on Sunday at 1pm but i was already committed to bringing pho home to the sick babe. The pho was excellent and the egg roll was one of the best i've ever had by far.  They recommend heating once we got home but we did not and it was a plenty hot still steaming. We have some nice large white soup bowls, we put the dry contents in, then poured all the broth, then topped it with the raw veg, squeezed some lime juice and it was so yummy.  The sweet and sour sauce for the egg rolls was yummy too, definitely going back.  I highly recommend if you're in the North end and want some excellent pho. We will try the pork sandwich next time."}
{"text":"The fresh coconut water was so good! The spring rolls were fresh and very good. The rare pho was amazing I've had a little cold and it was just what I needed! The bbq pork sandwich was very good the fresh cut up veggies on it gave it a nice touch! We will be back yum"}
{"text":"I agree with a few of the post I have read so far. The owner kept asking and trying to upsell the whole time I was there. I think they are really new and business could be better so upselling will help pay the bills. Overall food was good though. Bigger portions and more meat would have gave them five stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Definitely will be back for the pho and noodles! My little girl loved the flan. Food and service was perfect!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical. I was a big fan of the original owners/place. Didn't think it could get much better. I was wrong. I was so impressed. Feeling very lucky to live so close by. 5 stars for service, quality, taste, atmosphere, all of the above. Thanks so much Sunflower!!"}
{"text":"Went in expecting to order pho. The owners were extremely friendly and suggestive and made the place feel like home. Ended up ordering the Bun Bo Hue. I was blown away! SO GOOD! I feel lucky to live within walking distance of this restaurant. We will definitely visit regularly. Also had spring rolls and egg rolls and I was super impressed. Again, SO GOOD. I cannot emphasize how FRIENDLY and AWESOME the owners were. Thanks so much for the experience, Sunflower!! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"When I sat down, the owner spent time to go over the entire menu with me.  Very good service and atmosphere.  Pho 1-a and spring rolls were both delicious.  I will definitely be back!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The best place for pho ! The owners and the employees really know how to make a restaurant and make you feel comfortable. I recommend sunflower vietnamese."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see a highly rated Vietnamese restaurant in the NW. Had to go see it and try it out myself. The service is great. Staff is highly attentive and friendly. Food is excellent and presentation was good. If you don't feel like driving down to Chinatown for Vietnamese food this is a great alternative."}
{"text":"Meh... We were looking for a place with pho after being outside in the cold. There are not many choices on the north side of town. We chose this place based on the reviews and I was disappointed with the food. The spring rolls were really thick, but mostly stuffed with shredded iceberg lettuce. There were a few small.shimp and one or two very small pieces of pork. I got the rare steak pho, and it came with 5 small pieces of rare steak. There didn't seem to be very many noodles in the pho either. Everyone else had the same reaction to their food... meh. The service was very good but the food is not something I would ever return for."}
{"text":"Hot and New indeed! We just tried this place and we loved it. Family friendly. Best pho in NLV. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite little place to eat. I come here on the windy gloomy days for a bowl of their rare steak pho and it's the best I've had in this town. The customer service here is amazing and they make you feel so welcome! Everyone in Vegas should know about this place"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their spring rolls!!! It's the perfect snack after the gym lol great customer service and the cutest kiddos!"}
{"text":"I really enough eating here. My girlfriend and I come here often. They have friendly service and the food here is great and with in a good price budget. Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Wonderful family owned business. The owners make you fell like you are at home. That is special.  Great food, the best I have ever had. Thank you"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and plan on returning often. The place is clean and well appointed with excellent service. I've had the Pho both visits and it was delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Mom was craving some pho so I recommended this place that I always passed by on my way home from school. First of all, great service! Our server was willing to go through the whole menu with us and recommended some good meals, of which my mom got the spicy soup and she loved it! The food was great and a really nice atmosphere to sit and enjoy the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing!!!! Very friendly and made great recommendations for the everyone dining. I had the lemongrass beef plate and my husband and sister had combination pho, we all loved our dishes! Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions , good interior design, food is OKAY to pass American eaters   however to meet the standards of authentic vietnamese taste is about average. Pho was full of MSG they dont have enough customers to make a huge pot of pho so they add pho concentrate to boiling water kind of like the packages in top ramen! The owners husband and wife take turns cooking , they need to hire employees instead of trying to cut corners and handle everything themselves. Also, bringing their daughter to work to cut babysitting costs is a distraction to customer service.  The place has alot of potential if they hire a operations manager! Notice all good reviews come from non vietnamese or non asian yelpers lol"}
{"text":"What a find! The food was amazing. I had the chicken pho and the broth was so good. My husband had the number 15 and it was delicious. Everything tasted hot and fresh. We loved the family atmosphere. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this place, mainly because it was so new. I must say, I was i.pressed with their food. It was as good as my favorite pho spot, but I didn't have to drive all the way to Spring Mountain to get my pho fix. their prices are very good as well."}
{"text":"Tasty, clean food. Great service, neat and clean restaurant. Broth in the pho is flavorful and not greasy. Would like to see a few more rice dishes as this neighborhood gem grows."}
{"text":"The broth for the pho was amazing and the egg rolls are very fresh very good. Finally we got a Vietnamese restaurant here in North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"First time eating here. We had pho with rare steak. Noodles were perfect and meat tender. Great meal and good portion size for $8.50. Flan was great too. Great place to get pho without having to travel to Chinatown. Service was great. Clean with nice modern decor. Not crowded for a Saturday night. Will definitely go back to try other menu items next time."}
{"text":"Our first time trying this new Vietnamese restaurant, and it was pretty good. We had the fresh spring rolls with shrimp & pork, and pho ga. The broth had a tasty flavor, but noodles were on the softer side. Other than that, everything was awesome. The owners were very friendly, and very good with recommendations. I hope to try other food choices on their menu."}
{"text":"AMAZING, the service was great. The gentleman that helped us explained the entire menu and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. He gave us some great suggestions. When the food came out it was delicious we had a Vietnamese sandwich, PHO and chicken fried rice. It was very well made, the broth of the PHO was perfect! I recommend this place! This is our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"This place was good not what i thought it would be. The pho soup was good just doesnt have enough noodles, the man was cool but his service wasnt great, he had an attitude and he kept trying to sell us more and more which was awk while we ate, once again good food just too little noodles and the man is kinda rude and awk"}
{"text":"I really hate writing crappy reviews on family own restaurants, but I feel I have an obligation to help other Yelpers. I really hope the owner takes the time to revamp his menu and delivers good Vietnamese cuisine in the future.  I ordered fried rice with some spicy chicken dish and they ended up bringing me white rice with some heavily seasoned chicken that were flooded with onions - I mean too much onions. My husband order the beef stew soup and it was just plain, hardly any flavors. The amount was reasonable, but the flavors were just not there.  On top of this, they didn't have working A/C and we were baking at 115° on a Las Vegas afternoon. The staff didn't even apologize nor acknowledged that they A/C was not working. Unfortunately, I don't recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Finally a pho place near us! My daughter and I went 2x in one week. Service was wonderful... unlike many other pho restaurants. Nice ambiance, clean and had fresh flowers on both visits. Spring rolls were on point. Pho broth needs a bit more depth. Egg rolls could use some lettuce to wrap around. BBQ sandwich is tasty. Also tried the pork chop plate. It was ok. Thai tea was good and the Vietnamese hot coffee and iced coffee were on point as well. All in all, we'll be back and are grateful for them being in our area!!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town by far!  I come here once a week for the food and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese restaurant for locals! Glad I found this spot near my house.  My experience eating here was one of a kind. Family owned business. Met Myles the owner and the rest of the family. Very friendly and gave my girlfriend and I excellent recommendations.  I ordered their lemonade and the options you can choose from is regular or carbonated. I chose the regular. Best lemonade I ever had. My girlfriend had their Thai tea.  Main dish I ordered their number 4. He told me it has lemon grass and I had no idea what that was. I googled it and it looks healthy and organic. Usually when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant I order regular pho with combination meat but Miles highly recommend I try this one. Glad I tried this one! Unbelievable great taste! The flavor, noodles, meat etc. blended in so well. I really loved the broth.  My girlfriend ordered a noodle meat bowl. I forgot what it's called but there's a picture of it on the menu. There is some side of sauce you mix it with and we had to get an extra side because it was so good.  Overall experience was perfect. Myles was a great person to talk to. There was a huge tv on the bar playing music videos.The restaurant was good size, clean, and the whole design was nice.   Thank you Myles and family!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. Best Pho in Las Vegas. Great Family run restaurant will definitely be making this a regular spot in north Vegas. Everything is fresh and just a great family that owns this business."}
{"text":"Its very Nice and Very Friendly wonderful Staff  and very Clean environment. Great location and very easy to find if you are looking for it. The food smell great and taste is very good and has a great appetizers to choose from and the lovely bar counter makes it easy to not feel lonely eating great to watch TV too. I highly recommend this Pho Restaurant to enjoy a nice and lovely lunch whether by your self or with friends and coworkers too. . Price range was very decent and and the service was very quick too our wait wasn't no more than 10 mins amazing service overall. Most definitely will be coming g back to this pho !"}
{"text":"Sunflower is nice well run Vietnamese Restaurant.  The place is clean and the menu has classic pho choices.  It also has sandwiches and traditional Vietnamese coffee.  I liked the pho broth and the meal overall except they do not have tendon.  I would have given a 5 star, but I cannot for that reason.  If you are in the area I would invite you to come to the restaurant.  It is a nice alternative to having to go to Chinatown to experience well Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Ever since Pho Rancho closed, I have been looking for a Vietnamese restaurant on the north side of town.  I have found one.  Sunflower Vietnamese Restaurant is the place to go.  Broth is excellent. Wings are excellent. Good service.  Nice family atmosphere.  Prices are affordable.  Home made desserts.  I would recommend you trying it.  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I went here on New Year's Eve right before close and the owners were so lovely. I got the shrimp pho and it came out super quick. The pho was amazing! I think it's family owned their daughter who's 2-3 told me thank you and it was so cute. Thanks so much Sunflower!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if your in the mood for Pho in Vegas. The service is attentive, the decor is on par of a restaurant inside aria or cosmo, the pho is delicious and presentable without the heavy msg, and the price is a steal! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's modern and very relaxed vibe in there. The workers are sweet and friendly. Our meat pies were cold and when we went to go pay for it she apologized and gave us another order for free. They seem like they're trying and I like that about them. A little language barrier, but nothing that can't be solved with a little patience. They seem really into pleasing and I feel like they want to make they're restaurant he best it can be. I loved he service, food, and atmosphere. I got the chicken pho and the BBQ sandwich. Highly recommend trying the sandwiches. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is great. Never lets me down. I love that the food is reasonably priced. The guy who runs it is great. Interacts with his customers well. I often order take out. Love this place. Thanks fam for the good food."}
{"text":"We've been here few months back and they were good. And today we came back again and noticed that the food was more tastier. Only to find out it's a new owner. We had the sandwich, beef stew with baguette, pho, and some Vietnamese coffee. Everything was delicious. You got to try this place."}
{"text":"They have a new owner now, the Pho is delicious, and it look more than amazing. Definitely gonna come back for the food, the amazing staffs, and the modern style looking."}
{"text":"Pros: the restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean. Service was also good, the waiter checked on us frequently and was very friendly.   Cons: pho broth was pretty bland. We also ordered the bun thit nuong (pork, egg rolls, and shrimp over vermicelli noodles) which was also mediocre."}
{"text":"We are constantly looking for new places to eat and happened to call this restaurant . Myles was so nice and friendly we decided to give it a try and let me just say we weren't disappointed! The food here is so much more flavorful than all the  Vietnamese restaurants I've been to ! I may not be Vietnamese but I know what I like and the food here is delicious! I strongly believe in supporting local businesses... this one is a must !"}
{"text":"Super yummy food! It was very fresh and light. This will be my summer stop for food for sure. It has good decor and is clean. It looks like a family run place. They were very nice. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Finally North Side has another crack at a Vietnamese spot after Pho Rancho closed down.   Sunflower is a major upgrade from Pho Rancho. While it just opened up, the decor/ambiance in the restaurant isn't exactly where it's at right now but the food is great.  I ordered the grilled pork chop and pork banh mi to go. The grilled pork chop was perfect and not dry and the entree also includes this meat/omelette loaf that I've never had before. It was quite delicious though! The banh mi was especially great - the baguette wasn't overly crunchy to the point it'll cut the roof of your mouth and the flavors just melded together well. I could've easily eaten 3 of them!  I highly recommend this place especially if you don't want to drive all the way to Spring Mtn for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Took the family for pho for the first time. Everyone was very happy. The #4 pho, hot soup was the best. I'm the only one that ordered it and everyone else was jealous. Spring rolls were yummy and fresh. It was ran by a very nice family, even their little girl was polite and helpful. We will be returning."}
{"text":"We didn't expect what we tasted. It is a very good new Vietnamese restaurant in North Las Vegas. The Bun Bo Hue soup and Beef Noodles Stir Fry is are tasty I want to go back and eat it again and again.   Excellent!"}
{"text":"Instead of making the trip thru the under construction 15 to get to China town to get our fix on, we decided to give this now restaurant a try.  The food was good and the place clean, and the service very friendly.  Flavors we a little bland and different from what we're accustomed to, but most likely the recipes have been adjusted to suit more palettes.   All the food is made per order so you might need to wait a little, but you'll taste the freshness.   The fruit smoothies are a must at the very least."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food and service!  I brought my family here tonight for Pho and Spring Rolls.  We were not disappointed.  Food is fresh and the establishment is very clean.  There is a bar set up on the right side of the restaurant and tables on the left hand side.  Restrooms are located on the far right hand with doors which lock from the inside.  It is located in a strip mall off of Craig Road and Valley with plenty of parking in the front.  We came on a Sunday, but, with Denny's a few doors down and some other businesses, I can see the parking can be a little challenging during the normal Monday through Friday business hours.  Bottom line, Sunflower is delicious and the chef brings out the flavor in the food.  If you live in the northern side of the Metro and North Las Vegas, driving down 40-45 minutes to Spring Mountain Road for Vietnamese food is terrible.  This location gives me the opportunity to have some fine food with comparable prices less than 15 minutes from my house.    We'll be back again for sure and I recommend you try it out as well."}
{"text":"In total we've gone here about three times. The first time during their grand opening week, the food was really really good five stars in fact. But every subsequent time, the food kept getting worse and the service didn't improve (more on this later). So I'll write about our last visit.   We ordered the pho and banh mi sandwich. The pho was quite watery and lacked any onions or green onions or cilantro. Not flavorful and the portion size was tiny for the price. Very different experience from the first time we were here. The sandwich had small amounts of meat which again not worth the price. I sort of felt that they were being stingy with the quality and quantity which happens as restaurants age but it's not a good sign when it's happening within the first few months.   As for the service, the owners are this hard working Vietnamese couple with several young children. I love supporting family owned restaurants but it was clear that this was a too strictly family run business. All the times we were here, their young daughter served us which is totally fine but it was clear from the long time it took to get our food that there is a complete lack of an efficient system at this restaurant which is the reason their daughter was helping us. So hopefully they find their groove and hire some employees because there really is great potential in this restaurant. And hire someone with practical business knowledge."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Owners are super nice.  Sropped for some Pho and they talked me into the beef stew.  Really happy he did because it was delicious.  Great little spot.  Been wanting a Pho place closer to us in North Las Vegas.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here for the first time tonight. Fantastic food! We tried the spring rolls first. Very fresh with a complex and unique peanut sauce. Not your run of the mill peanut butter and soy sauce glop that you get everywhere else. Wonderful! I had a combo rice vermicelli. It was also very fresh, the grilled meats were crispy and smoky, and the shrimp were perfectly done. Topping it was a fish sauce based vermicelli that was as complex and unique as was the peanut sauce. My son had Bun Bo Hue. A rich complex noodle/broth dish with assorted Pho veggies, meats and shrimp. The noodles were thicker than Pho noodles, nearly as thick as spaghetti. Soft and chewy, and the perfect compliment to the broth. The broth was mildly spicy, and very complex. We still can't decide all of what was in it, but we'll have it again and again. Eventually we'll figure it out. Miles and his wife run a very clean, friendly place. Great people and very great food. Try this place, and you'll be hooked.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Vegetarian spring rolls were huge and delicious! New management seems to have this place up and running better than ever."}
{"text":"Its really hard to find a good pho place , but not anymore this place is really good ! My boyfriend got the beef pho he loved it ! I got the beef stew it was amazing ! We also got the crab rangoon it was really good as well ! We will definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"Delicious pho is now available in the Northwest! This restaurant is beautiful inside. I believe it was previously a sushi bar as the decor seems similar to a higher end sushi joint. Our waiter was friendly and checked on us often. We ordered the rare beef pho, specialty Vietnamese sandwich, vermicelli with sautéed steak and onions, and the egg rolls. Everything was so good! The pho with rare meat had that perfect complex broth, rich with flavor and spiced perfectly. The vermicelli had juicy morsels of steak with onions that still had a crunch. The fish sauce that accompanied the dish helped to cut through the savory beef flavor, and the noodles were hearty. My daughter ate most of this dish so I savored the few bites I snagged! The egg rolls were freshly prepared and served piping hot. They were everything an egg roll should be, fresh, crispy and tasty. Now to my favorite item of the meal, the sandwich. It was breathtaking! The bread was fresh and still had that crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside texture. The cucumbers were sliced thinly which added a light refreshing bite to the mild deli meat. The cilantro and jalapeños added another layer of pungent flavor. The spread, which the contents I know not, added yet another layer of creamy flavor to the mix. I could not stop eating it after the first bite. It's one of those amazing things that happens when you're eating a dish that continually delivers different flavor combinations. The icing on the cake is the fact that it only costs $4.50. I'd return for that alone! We also enjoyed the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk and it was heavenly! I worried the condensed milk would be way too sweet, but it wasn't. The combination of the milk with the bold dark roast coffee made it a smooth lightly sweet delight. After all that our bill was still less than $50, which means I'm already planning to go back this week!"}
{"text":"Very good meat. Best meat I've ever had. Might be the best meat I've ever had next to wolf gang puck.  Supposedly the flan is Bomb but I've never tried it yet, I definitely will next time tho. Ragoons are best ever. No process taste.   Thanks Myles & Sue"}
{"text":"I saw great reviews and was excited to try the pho but I'm very disappointed and I feel like I wasted my money. It was misleading, the pho was talked up but was not very good."}
{"text":"After frequenting this spot a few more times, we walked out a tad disapppinted. Our first experience was great! I loved the tone the owner wanted to set. However after the few visits I think his talking could ruin it for them. The first time he really talked a big game. But a game to be hopeful for and that we were rooting for!  He and his wife had gone around trying out different Vietnamese restaurants so what they  set out to do was to make their Bo kho more hearty than watery. The first time was perfect. Flavorful, not as watery as other spots, tendons, and meat you got it. This is why we craved to go back.  We went back with disappointment as they had run out of Bo Kho. And that's completely fine, no problem. So we opted for their pho. I've said this before that I don't prefer to eat pho; but, it doesn't mean I don't like it nor have I not had my share in ensuring at every Vietnamese restaurant I go to is to try their pho. With that said, their pho here is all right. Was it an off night? Not sure. I'd rather make the drive.  We came another time and they did have Bo Kho. Husband and I had the yay in our eyes! When the hubs was served his stew he fished around and was seriously disappointed yall. Like for real disappointed. I was staring at him uncomfortably because usually my husband will just go to town. He was disappointed about having no tendons in his stew. Nothing but small pieces of meat swimming around in what was actually a watery broth and not the flavor we were introduced to the first time.  The owner asked how's everything...my husband inquires about the tendons. You could tell the owner kinda got off his track about it...long story short...he says he has been noticing customers have been leaving the tendons so rather than patrons wasting tendons, they just omit it. Ummm...I can get that concept, but bo kho is a stew that has collagen type cuts of meat. People will pick foods out of dishes all the time but doesn't mean you alter it because of these people. You just have to take that hit as long as you stick true to the dish to keep it authentic. There are people who LOVE the tendons.   The tone he set for us on the 1st night was no longer the same tone after the next couple visits. Who wouldn't feel bummed.  While there are a few things I could pick on, I don't feel like it's necessary to. I still think they're a good option if you don't want to make the drive. Unfortunately, for us...we will continue to make our drive as it is much more worthed to considering the prices here are a tad higher than the spot we go to. But that's just us, folks. They're still very new and I'm sure in time it'll come together.  Please note...the food isn't bad at all. For the OVERALL experience, though, we'll give them some time as we stick to our usual."}
{"text":"This is my new PHO spot with I'm in north town. Delicious pho, really good spring rolls that appeared to be made fresh. Good service and decorated very tastefully inside. The crowd when I visited was a new age 30's crowd."}
{"text":"My girlfriend ate here when they just opened and never stopped talking about it. She said it's better than most overrated restaurants in China town. And eating here today made me agree with her. They do have amazing food and amazing ambience and very nice people. Totally worth it. I'd honestly come back here for date nights with my girl. We eat phó a lot and we know what good phó is, they have great phó. 10/10 would recommend! You guys should try it out too and see if I'm lying!"}
{"text":"Worst Phö I've ever tasted. Broth was very sweet for some reason. I ended up eating only the noodles and some of the meat.. and I ended up getting diarrhea!! Only got this place because it was closest to me.. never again. I'm sticking to Phö Kim Long!!"}
{"text":"Nice customer service, but the food was super disappointing. The soup broth was very bland--it was like drinking water. The hoisin sauce and sriracha did not help with the broth. The spring rolls were fluffed with lots of lettuce and the peanut sauce was very watery. The egg rolls or the sauce that came with it had a soapy taste."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some bomb bun bo hue this is the spot! Especially one that uses the round rice noodles in place of the normal pho noodles. I also got the pork chop which was a pretty big portion. I only wish I asked them to cook it with some green onions, but otherwise it was juicy and marinated really well. The place is family owned and the owner is really down to earth too. I'm definitely coming up here instead of driving all the way down to spring mountain now that there's a bomb Vietnamese place north side."}
{"text":"Came and they were closed at 6PM on a Monday evening with 0 explanation posted on the door. From reading other reviews the owner seems to have no problem talking back to customers when he doesnt agree with them, but seems to have no response for the reviews saying they close early with no warning to patrons... hm..... I get it, its a family business, you got kids, shit happens, but It doesnt take ANY effort to atleast put a sign up saying \"sorry for the inconvenience we closed early.\" OR heres a better idea, CHANGE YOUR BUSINESS HOURS!! Simply poor business management. Would love to hear the owner try to excuse himself out of this one.."}
{"text":"New management rocks! Soups not so much... The staff are very attentive and the interior has been upgraded. There's a better atmosphere than the previous times we have had but...  Pho and Bun Bo Hue did not own up to my expectations. I'm Vietnamese and have been eating many tradition dishes and soups so I know what real authentic and rich soup tastes like.  Not saying that theirs isn't \"authentic\" it's just bland like something you would find anywhere for \"PHO\".  I liked my food but wasn't left leaving with the impression of getting soups from here anymore.  There's a lot of potential and I'll probably be back in another time. Overall great service, good setting, soups didn't impress me. Pho should be amazing- but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho in north town. Very friendly service and the restaurant was clean. Ordered the pho. It's a little on the sweet side but you can add sriracha to spice thing up. Ordered the egg rolls and meat pies. Not the best egg rolls but their still good. Meat pie was great."}
{"text":"This is a cool and upcoming mom n pops restaurant. Owners are very nice and encourage on trying different things on the menu other than pho. I got the pho regardless lol. The pho was actually really good! Very flavorful, hot and had fresh bean sprouts. Also ordered the egg rolls and spring rolls which were also very fresh and tasty. Great service, awesome food, and close to home! Yeah, I'll be there as a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!!!!  They are open now people and they are so much better than before!!!  With legit servers/staff!  The place looks brand new too!  The food was delicious! With the right amount of meat and pho noodle!  The broth was so much better! It is not oily as well, very tasty!!  Come and eat here for your pho cravings!!"}
{"text":"Amazing little place with great quality of soup. Pho is a must, take 'A' version of it. If you're not really into an intestine component, you may ask to replace tendon with another type of meat. Wings were a little crispy, which I really liked, though. Definitely will come bavk whenever I'll have a chance."}
{"text":"This is probably THE best soup base for pho I had in a while. Simple menu and good service.   I am 10 mins from here so this is for sure my weekly stop for simple meal."}
{"text":"So kind and prompt service. Restaurant is clean and well kept (I know I've worked as a plumber to fix up thousands) the pho is awesome. I'm eating the spicy beef pho right now and it's so good. The spicy beef isn't too hot and I like spice but it just the right amount of spice to not mask the beautiful flavor of the pho. I know I'll be going back and soon"}
{"text":"We found the restaurant through a write up in the local paper. The atmosphere is friendly and the restaurant is very clean.  The owner was very friendly and took the time to explain the items on the menu which will be a benefit to anyone new to PHO. The food was very fresh and very  good. I had the vermicelli with the grilled chicken and egg roll. The portions are very generous.  We will be back!"}
