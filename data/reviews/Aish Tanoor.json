{"text":"We ate at Aish Tanoor yesterday and really enjoyed it! We had the rainbow trout and dark chicken with salads and laffah. We had a few appetizers, including hummus with mushrooms. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was very friendly with great service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Nothing can beat a Laffa sandwich which can be eaten by 2 people. Authentic Israeli food. We love the shawarma, the schnitzel and the perfectly cooked chicken kebobs. They have a variety of tasty salads that are awesome and recently ate the shakshuka in a bread bowl. The food is delicious although a bit pricey since it is kosher."}
{"text":"My wife & I ate here.   We had Grilled Chicken shishkabab , steamed vegetables and Laffa pita bread. There was pickled sliced beets and cole slaw also. The meal was served promptly. The food was delicious. The food was kosher."}
{"text":"Amazing food and large portions!  The laffa comes piping hot to your table and goes perfectly with the various topped hummus that Aish Tanoor serves.  I would recommend the mushroom one, it's amazing.  The shakshuka in a bread bowl was also amazing but there is no way you could finish everything on that plate in one sitting!   They do not serve alcohol, the closest thing is a weird malty beverage that seems to be popular in the Middle East.    If you want to order for pickup, don't go through Foodora, the prices are marked up slightly, you can always call for a phone order!"}
{"text":"Best laffas in Toronto.  Owner used to own dr. Laffa. Chicken shishkabab soft, juicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"So far the most authentic Israeli food I ate in Toronto.  Their hummus is brilliant and the laffa is delicious.   Try their variety of salads, specially the eggplants!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Thursday night. I had a falafel on a laffa and he had kebab on a laffa. Both were excellent, fresh and delicious. Huge portions and great customer service. Very attentive staff and great skilled chef. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent Israeli style shawarma.  Authentic laffa bread.  Eat with mango based Amba sauce.  Complimentary nibbles of salad to start. Good rib steak.  Tastes authentically middle eastern."}
{"text":"Not impressed, food came cold to the table, mind you it was a Shwarma in a pita with lettuce tomatoes and everything else.. they took it and heated it up with everything in it.. still came back cold and tomatoes and lettuce were soggy..  not worth the money , sorry just being honest,  Service was below standard and you could have  just made a new sandwich for what you charge."}
{"text":"Huge shawarma. Definitely get the luffa as it's made in-house as opposed to the pita. Tasted great and was essentially a shawarma made with naan bread. Very tasty but could have done without the tinfoil which easily gets in the shawarma."}
{"text":"The most authentic Israeli food in the heart of the city. The hummus is stellar, the service is awesome and the place pleasant. I like that everything is very fresh, well priced and healthy. YOU MUST TRY THE SHAKSHUKA IN THE BREAD BOWL! It's a whole new way of eating Shakshuka. It is super filling and a great tasting dish!"}
{"text":"Israel is a bundle of cultural influences, rooted in the wide-scale convergence of people from different parts of the world.   The mid-20th century saw a huge influx of immigrants, from places like the Middle East, who brought with them stuff like pita and rice.   That makes Israeli cuisine incredibly important and diverse - in modern days, it becomes a fusion of its residents, but also a culmination of experiences of Jews throughout history.   That's not to say that all Israeli food is Arab-influenced. This ignores many of the regional differences too! Large parts of Israeli cuisine is also influenced by Mediterranean, North African, Eastern Europe, and more.   Aish Tanoor plainly is in the camp of Middle Eastern Israeli food. It does it well, too. Authenticity aside, the food here is truly tasty, and the portions large.   Frankly, the service isn't great - but I can't say that I care, since the food is good enough anyways.   A great microcosm of my meal was the start: my meal started with pickled vegetables and olives - two things that I usually don't enjoy eating, because I find they are too salty for my palate. But here, they were salted just right.   Big fan of this place. Will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to a kosher place on my trip to Toronto so my kids, who keep kosher, could eat a meat meal.  This place was wonderful! The service was very good, the prices were reasonable and the laffas were huge.  I normally don't leave kosher restaurants happy, but for this place I did. If I lived in Toronto, I would be here very frequently."}
{"text":"Really great menu, kosher Israeli food. I've been to many restaurants in Toronto but this is honestly the best one so far. They start your salads, dips, hummus, pickles, egg plant and a giant fresh pita directly from the oven. The food was amazing, the service was great.  You won't taste anything similar to this in toronto !! Must try"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying am not Israeli nor Jewish nor Kosher :P but I really liked the food. I got a beef kebab on a salad. The beef was fresh & tasty. I should have gotten 2 kebaba instead of 1. I don't know what they put in their salad but it is so good & tastes fresh & lemony! Yum. I'd come back just for that. It is a simple salad too. Just lettuce, cucumbers & tomatoes. They also gave me 3 mini salads to start & they were good as well. I didn't get the bread as I am on a very low carb diet. The only small issue was that with tax & 15% tip, my total was around $18. I thought that that was pricey for 1 kebab on a salad. If I am in the area & hungry I'd go back but I won't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Aish Tanoor is a great spot for authentic Iraqi-Israeli \"street style\" food. Their claim to fame is the tandoor-style stove, where they make fresh laffa pita bread fresh to order. I ordered the falafel in pita ($6.99) for some delicious falafel balls made fresh to order. I recommend to up-size to the laffa version, in order to try their famous laffa.   They added a variety of nice toppings free of charge (other places may charge for, say fried eggplant, but this place doesn't.) If you're like me, you won't shy away from any of the 4 essential sauces to be added to your pitta: 1. Hummus spread 2. Tahini sauce 3. Hot sauce 4. Amba sauce - mango chutney of very pronounced curry flavor - extra delicious, if you like curry.  I will be back to try some of their tasty-looking shawarma and meat dishes.  P.S. Aish Tanoor is a Kosher establishment."}
{"text":"Great hot soup! Great meals! Great sides and snacks!! This place is great for eating in or take out.  The bread is made as you wait.  Come by and sample the great food, hot daily soup and bread and warm hospitality!!! If you're in the neibourhood....try it...you'll love it and you'll be back."}
