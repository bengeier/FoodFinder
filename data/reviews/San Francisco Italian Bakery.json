{"text":"This bakery has everything you need to feel like you're in an actual bakery.  Their pastries, desserts, pies, breads, premade dinners and hot table are all ever so tasty!   I ordered a birthday cake from them and was very pleased!  Very fresh and the prices are very reasonable.   I'm so glad that we have an Italian bakery here in Georgetown that has authentic real Italian food!   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great pasta - basil sauce and tomato sauce are delicious and good size portions and price is reasonable. Bakery has good options like cinnamon wrists, buns and bread, and cookies."}
{"text":"Lovely little Italian bakery shop, nice pastry and snacks.  I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce, and additional rice ball.  It was pretty good, but wish they had indoor seating for people to eat their food."}
