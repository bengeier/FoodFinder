{"text":"This is the best tamales! they have a variety of different flavors- and they're all delicious. The one that I always get is the pork, it's mild and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"These tamales are the best tamales I've ever eaten. They are extra large and stuffed with quality fillings. Nothing comes close to these tamales."}
{"text":"Great Tamales ... I consider myself authentic mexican guy lol I have bought from many places here in Las Vegas including people that sell out in the streets and these are by far one of the best ones Ive had a little pricy but well worth it  Plus its around the corner where I live from"}
{"text":"Well I decided to check out this new place that just opened.  I pulled up and from outside it doesn't look like much and even though the open sign was on I wasn't sure if anyone was in there. I went in around 345 and was told there were only a couple kinds left so I got the spicy pork and spicy chicken tamales. I have to say they are VERY good, I definitely love the chicken ones better but they are both worth it. I really have to say the are stuffed with filling and WORTH the money. I will definitely go back when I'm  craving some tamales."}
{"text":"The tamales were handmade and delicious. Just go early to get the tamales you want. We went at 7pm and they were sold out except for four. We live 30 minutes away so we were pretty disappointed. But the four we had were great!"}
{"text":"The tamales are great !! The owner is a super nice guy. Tried almost all of the flavors. My favorite are the chicken (mild). The green sauce is very tasty, just a little too hot for me. Try them, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Tamales!  I love the peppers and cheese but the meat ones are good also!  Definitely worth checking out if you haven't been there."}
{"text":"Great tamales, will be back for more.  Very tasty, with  varietys  Of tamales. Hubby had the chicken Chile Verde. Best he ever had."}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! I have found where I will get my tamales for now on. I bought 12 tamales thinking they were normal size. Wrong. They are huge,& delicious. I highly recommend & you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Patty's Tamales has the best tamales I've had so far! They have excellent customer service. The young male worker got my order wrong and I had to drive back which was inconvenient, but Javier (the owner or manager) made it all worthwhile. He corrected my order and let me have a little extra. The worker genuinely apologized as it was an honest mistake. I appreciate a business that owns up to their mistakes and goes above and beyond for their customers. The only downfall is that this place takes cash only (most of the time), but these tamales are worth giving a try! Oh, and maybe label the packages as to avoid giving the wrong tamales. I would call before going to make sure they have what you want. Sometimes, they are out of certain ones. Other than that, I'm definitely going back when I'm in the mood! :) Thank you, Patty's Tamales! Cravings satisfied!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas and was looking for \"tamales to go\" for a family dinner. I found Patty's Tamales with good reviews.  Wow! I was impressed.  Currently, Patty's Tamales only sells tamales to go. These tamales are excellent. They are  huge and filled with a lot of meat. The masa  was moist and not dry. I ordered the chicken in red sauce, chicken in mole, and the pineapple. All were a big hit when served for dinner. If your looking for tamales to go, I highly recommend Patty's Tamales."}
{"text":"I was traveling through Vegas this week and I had stopped into the plaza across the way to run some errands- I spied this little tamale joint across the street and couldn't resist checking it out. I have fond childhood memories of family friends loading me down with containers of delicious tamales during the holiday season when I was growing up in Phoenix, so this place sent me into a nostalgia groove.  I stopped in around noon and ordered one cheese/chile and one chicken/chile- unfortunately they only had chicken at the time, so I took two of those. I took them back to my car and opened up the bag and was amazed at how large each tamale was! Just as I remember, wrapped in moist wax paper, tender morsels clinging to the corn husk. After one bite, I did not regret that they only had chicken/chile. The tamales were stuffed to overflowing with juicy, spicy chicken in a tart green sauce with a thin and tender savory sweet masa shell. Every bite was heaven!  At 1.50 each, these are an absolute steal! The service is quick and the counter staff are friendly. There is currently no seating, so expect a takeaway. These travel well, so consider grabbing a half dozen for dinner. I can't wait to stop here again on my next trip through Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in the Southwest and these tamales are the best I've ever had. After trying so many restaurants in Las Vegas, I have been very disappointed in every tamale until trying Patty's. I will be going back often, and recommend you try these amazing tamales."}
{"text":"The only thing on the menu is tamales, and that's how it should be, because they are so good you would be a fool to order anything else. They are also relatively cheap. Legit tamales are hard to find, look no further, this place has em."}
{"text":"Tamales are my favorite food. This delivers on that craving! The store is bare besides the counter to order. The menu is straightforward and has about 8 options to choose from. The chicken with green sauce is amazing! I am looking forward to trying the other flavors. Especially the sweet tamale with pineapple! The man working the counter was very nice and welcoming. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've been reading the reviews for Patty's, and I love tamales, so today, after running errands in the area, I decided to give them a try.  First impression: I arrived at around 10:55am. Upon entering, the first thing I took notice of(and, I do so in any restaurant or food establishment, even grocery stores) are the floors. It's one of my pet peeves...to walk into a business that sells food and see the floors sticky, dirty, and just plain unkempt. Well, I must say, that was not the case with Patty's. Floors were spotless and I'm talking pristine. Windows were crystal clear. The counter was clean, wiped down. And, upon looking in the back to the open kitchen, I could see that the work area and the place (the stove top) that held the food I was about to order, definitely met my expectations, cleanliness wise.   I approach the counter and I am greeted/acknowledged by a man, possibly the owner?  I begin scanning the menu, which is simple, and I so appreciate that. I then ask him to please give me his opinion on the green chicken tamales, in regards to the spiciness level, that is, because I'd read through the yelp reviews that the green chicken is overboard spicy. Well, he did confirm that it is super, super spicy. I prefer green sauce over red, and as other reviewer's have commented, red sauce here is mild and green sauce is hot. But, while I do love a little heat in a majority of the dishes I eat, I cannot handle too much heat. Too much and it becomes unenjoyable really fast for me. Anyways, I decided on just giving the red sauce chicken tamales a try. I ordered two. Price was $2 each, totaling $4, no tax. Not bad at all! The guy that took my order went back to the stove where the tamales are kept in humongous stock pots, and retrieved two tamales. I could see the steam emanating from them. Exciting!!   I thought the man that took my order was very welcoming, professional, and just based on that first impression alone, I'd consider returning, especially if the food is up to par, as well. He asked if I lived in the area, if this was my first time visiting Patty's, and he did treat me, the customer, how I feel I should be treated, how I think any customer would want to be treated.  So, I left, and of course tried one of the tamales I'd purchased, once I arrived home. The tamales are a decent size, not small by any means. They're also heavy, just another indicator of their huge size, and that's always a plus. Next, I unwrapped the corn husks and delved in. The inside of the tamales were packed with chicken and the mild red sauce. I thought it tasted just as it should. The meat wasn't dry, and it did have flavor. The masa, (my favorite part of a tamale!) was also flavorful, but the most important thing to me was the meat/masa ratio, which was perfecto! Not too much chicken, vice versa. The taste was good and I enjoyed it.  As I mentioned above, I love chicken tamales! If, (or when, I should say) I am craving one, I'd certainly consider coming back here. The customer service, in addition to the freshness of the food, the speedy service, the price, ($2! for a large tamale? Uh, yeah!) and the cleanliness of the place, definitely warrants a second visit from me. Although, I will say- like other reviewers have- that this is not a sit-in restaurant. It's take out only, so just another reminder from me.   To sum it up, this was a pleasant experience for me. If you like tamales and happen to be on the East side, I'd suggest you pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Very good.clean friendly staff. God bless their shop. And Thank you Yelp for spot lighting this shop. Or I'd have never found. I'm in Summer in."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to patty's tamales and the gentleman that took me and my girl friends order was very nice and took our order very prompt I tell u these tamales are the bomb we ordered 4 chicken tamales with the red sauce there very meaty juicy tender and most of all not dry ther are very moist delicious. thanks Javier for your excellent customer service"}
{"text":"amazing, delicious tamales. i couldnt wait to get them home. the smell gets you first then you bite into one and it tastes like it smells amazing."}
{"text":"I cant say im a huge fan of tamales but i love tamales from Patty's. I highly recommend calling ahead to find out when theyre about to finish cooking a fresh batch, but if your anything like me,you'll just pop in and see what they're cooking.  On my first visit, i was lucky enough to purchase a couple of green chili chicken tamales. 1. They were sold out of all their other ones. & 2. This one was fresh right out of the pot. Cant go wrong with fresh! It literally burned my leg when i set the bag down oncd i got in my car. Most importantly, it melted into my mouth. I squeezed out the masa chicken green chili goodness like it was a freezer pop and it was amazing! Highly recommend it for anyone that has never had a tamale or even likes them. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something more than tamales, this is not your place. But, if you want some delicious tamales this is where you want to go."}
{"text":"Patty's has Excellent tamales!!!  1 tamale is enough to fill you up and they're very affordable.  They are so good I'm taking a dozen back home to Chicago."}
{"text":"Amazing! The green sauce is spicy but good! And the tables are huge and filled well. Super fresh"}
{"text":"I didn't like the service or the $1 service charge for using a credit card. The tamales are ok. I've had alot better."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! So I decided to try this place out since I missed the Christmas rush for tamales. Place was empty when I got there and was served immediately. I  ordered green spicy chicken and the red pork spicy.  He pulled them right out of the pot and were still warm by the time I got home. There aren't any seats to wait or eat there but since I was helped quickly didn't matter anyway.   Opened my bag and these things are HUGE!!! And I really mean HUGE!!!  They both were sooo good I didn't know what to with myself. The spicy pork with the red sauce is pretty spicy but not too bad. Now that green chicken one is really really spicy and I'm still sniffling from these but since I love spicy food I was in heaven. I wouldn't recommend these if you can't handle real spicy food go with the mild chicken green ones. You also get alot of meat compared to the masa which means you can definitely probably can only eat 1 or 2. So did you get that I said they were HUGE????  Okay good.   Since I'm a Cali born and raised mexican food obsessed person, I recommend giving them a try. They are $2.00 each but well worth it because they are HUGE. People who complain about them being $2.00 have probably never bought them before. I mean those mini street tacos are about $2.00 each and nowhere near the size of these tamales and I have to eat about 6 of those little things to get full. But enough of that rant so don't let the price discourage you. The only drawback was they charged me an extra $1.00 to use my card and didn't tell me. But I knew that before while I read previous reviews. Just think that's something to make customers aware of ahead of charging my card.   I will be a returning customer as I am extremely satisfied with this place."}
{"text":"I would rather buy the frozen tamales at Albertsons! Not worth the price. Don't really get how people say it's \"good\" , I couldn't eat it, you can tell the salsa is can salsa......just gross!!"}
{"text":"First things first.  These are not ta\"masas\".  You know what I mean, tamales made almost completely out of masa.  These aren't them.  Good sized and packed full of yummy goodness at 1.50 a piece, they are a good deal.  The fam and I tried the Chicken Green Chile (spicy).  Not our first choice but they were out of nearly everything else.  They were not kidding.  They are quite spicy but delicious nonetheless. I have knocked off a star due to not having the full experience of the other flavors that would have been my primary choices.  I look forward to trying the other flavors and possibly upping my score.  If you find yourself in need of tamales you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"The best in Vegas their green chicken tamales are our favorite but if you can't handle spicy I suggest you get the red mild tamales"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! Perfect masa to meat ratio. These are the Mexican tamales wrapped in corn husk. A lot of their options were spicy so be sure to ask which is which!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com - these tamales are off the hook! Hopefully they will stay in stock because they always r out of everything but hey its so bomb u can't even complain cuz u just wanna keep coming back lol!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend got me some tamales from there several times.  It was really good & I loved it!  So why 4 stars not 5 stars....  coz they never had shrimp tamales he goes there different days, different times but they always said \"oh we are out for that \"  he even asked them what time he should come then he did but still haven't got it yet  :(   One day when I tried it, most likely they'll get 5 stars   Overall they have very good tamales"}
{"text":"Best tamales in town! I've been to a few different places in town to get tamales and Patty's Tamales by far is the best place if you need a tamale fix.   Their tamales are big, moist, and flavorful, plus they only charge $2 per tamales which is definitely a steal compared to other places. I'd recommend Patty's tamales to anyone."}
{"text":"This place had several choices at a good price. They were large Tamales and they were very good. The Green Chili Chicken tamales are the best."}
{"text":"Best Tamales in Vegas! I went around 11am so they were fresh. Chicken throughout the entire tamale. Yesssss"}
{"text":"So i have been going to Pattys Tamales for a while now, i even would refer people..I went back last week only to discover that they jacked up the price on their tamales from 1.50 per tamale (which I thought was reasonable) to 2 bucks per tamale. So they got their clientele hooked at 1.50 only to then Jack up the price. I think 24.00 for a dozen tamales is totally ridiculous! I think they are taking advantage and I dont think I will be going back..PS. they also charge a buck if u use your debit card..seems like a greedy business to me and will no longer be sending people there."}
{"text":"The tamale was good and I got what I paid for. For $2 their tamales are big. However the green chicken was way too spicy for me. I couldn't enjoy my meal. Thank goodness I also got a red chicken. Hopefully I'll be able to enjoy it once my taste buds cool down! That being said, it seems I'll only have the red chicken and the sweet ones to choose from in the future since their \"spicy\" is freaking hot! I'd give them more stars if they had more non spicy choices."}
{"text":"Not the worst but I've had better. And their green sauce is way too spicy and I like spicy but I couldn't even enjoy the tamale."}
{"text":"Ordered green chicken & red pork tamales. Both were wonderful and so filling. I loved how they were hot & fresh and were made like homemade. I did prefer the green chicken over the red pork. To me the green chicken was savory & very spicy where the red pork was more just spicy & not savory. They we're filled very well too, nothing left lacking with these tamales. I definitely recommend giving them a try I think anyone who loves spicy tamales will LOVE these and their quick to serve you. I read by other reviewers already that there's a $1 fee for debit or credit card users and I can confirm that's true, I was disappointed by this but oh well."}
{"text":"I called at 810pm and asked the guy what time they closed. He said 830pm. I showed up at 819pm and the door is locked and lights off. You could have told me when I called that you were going to close early. Your sign in the window shows you are open until 830pm. Tamales are ready, you just have to package them. What would have been a 1st visit left me not wanting to come back. Bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is really small, just order from their small menu and they bag it for you to take home. You can pay with cash or card and there is no option for you to sit down and eat there. I was really craving for some tamales so my sister and I went to pick some up for the family. There are pretty big tamales and felt stuffed after eating one. My only real complaint about this place is that they got 2 or my orders wrong... Instead of brown sauce chicken I got green sauce shrimp. It was a disappointment only because I clarified with him to ensure my order was correct while ordering. I was just bummed because the two shrimp tamales ended up not being eaten because they were too spicy for anyone at home.  I will be coming back, just hope they get my order right."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I am originally from California,and was unable to find an  authentic Mexican food place that served decent tamales..that is until I came here.The son and father  that own it ,were very polite,and even put in some plates,and forks with my order.They smelt so good, I sat in my vehicle and ate two. Very moist, seasoned just right,and the size was just right for the price. I highly recommend this establishment,they have a life time customer here"}
{"text":"Huge and delicous homemade tamales can be purchased here for $1.50 each. This Lil mom and pop shop is located on Sahara and Nellis. Cash only, no cards here.  The menu is fairly basic, offering pork, chicken and cheese tamales as well as sweet corn and pineapple. They have red, green and mole sauces. As of 6/10 they had shrimp tamales too.  Apparently they don't always have their full menu. I am not sure if they run out or what but it's best to go early. My friend went in on a Friday afternoon and placed an order of what we wanted, then picked them up and paid a few hours later. I ordered 2 jalapeño and cheese, 2 red pork, and 2 sweet corn and pineapple tamales. It was $9 for 6 HUGE tamales with plentiful fillings. You cannot beat this deal.   My friend got a couple mole and chicken tamales that I got to taste and it was so yummy. I love mole sauce and hadn't seen it offered in a tamale before, but what a great idea. I do have to say my favorite was the sweet corn and pineapple though. It was sweet and sinful like I was eating a dessert. The jalapeño and cheese were delicious but holy crap those are spicy. I had heartburn for hours after, but it was so worth it. I let my man eat the pork ones and he loved them. Probably the best tamales I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Perfect spice! Love the tamales here. Their tamales are so moist. I usually eat mine with salsa because other places are dry but not here. Their green chicken tamales is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great tamales, place is a little weird.  You can't take pictures, and it's handy to be able to snap a pic of the menu for later use (and would probably be good for their business, but, alas).  If you don't see the sign and start to take a pic, they'll let you know in no uncertain terms, so be aware.  However, the tamales really are good.  Some of the hot varieties are a little too hot, but they're still delish -- just be careful if you're not into spicy heat in your food.  Tamales are enormous, so keep that in mind when you order.  Wasn't a fan of the dessert tamales, but I've never gone for sweet tamales.  Ambience is basically fast food tamales.  They run out of tamales during busy times, so best to go early.  Give Patty's a try, yum!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and grabbed 10 tamales.. the food is amazing.. the punk kid assisting not so much.. wont be back because of rude customer service only...."}
{"text":"The Best! I'm a regular customer now.   Tamale Tuesday 7 days a week"}
{"text":"Best tamales I have ever had in Vegas. That being said the difficult part is getting the tamales you want because they sell out so quickly."}
{"text":"They are tasty and a good size.  Basic little place that just serves tamales to go, no seating or in house restaurant.  A decent assortment of flavors are available.  The green chicken is the spiciest, and the red chicken is not spicy at all, but all were excellent.  The tamales are now $2 a piece, with the shrimp and beef ones $2.5 I believe.  I paid $24 for a dozen, with a mix of beef, chicken and pineapple ones."}
{"text":"They were real quick they don't have tables to sit in and shoutout to Fritzi for helping us, she followed through all the way by giving us suggestions and letting us know about what they offer and the young gentleman in the front(cashier) acknowledged us once we stepped in."}
{"text":"Called at 7:45 and asked what they had left they said basically everything, drove half an hour to get here and when I got there they said they only had cheese and pepper left. Wish if they were running low on everything else they would have mentioned that when I called, think that's a pretty important thing to mention when someone calls and asks, why else would I be calling if not because I was heading over to pick stuff up. Thank you for wasting an hour of my time."}
{"text":"These are the best restaurant/store bought tamales I could find in town. The green and cheese are very spicy. If you don't like spicy food you won't enjoy them. I've also tried the red and mole. All very good. One negative is that they don't always have all the tamales available that are on the menu. They also don't take orders ahead of time."}
{"text":"Okay I have to complain here. Great tamales but....THEY NEVER HAVE ANY READY WHEN YOU GO TO BUY THEM!! If you are just \"a tamale\" place have those tamales ready to go for christ sake. It is always the same old line \" in 45 minutes\" geez, just keep on making and cooking those suckers and and make more of the ones you sell out of.   Just sent my husband over to buy a couple...he brought home a dozen. Let me tell you these tamales are huge, moist and DELICIOUS!! Every bite had meat! The cheese was packed also! I will be putting in my order for Christmas Eve dinner!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 6 stars, I would.  The shrimp tamale was so flavorful.  Never heard of shrimp tamale, now it's my favorite.  Pattys has us as new regulars.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"It was my first and last time at Patty's Tamales.  I had ordered the red chicken tamales and asked him several times to make sure he was giving me the right ones.  When I looked in the bag he had given me the green ones instead.  Being that I don't eat any spicy food,  I went back right away and told him he gave me the wrong order.  He got an attitude with me and told me that that was what he had written down and that I don't pay attention and then he proceeded to very rudely hand me back my money.  I told him they had terrible customer service, but he said he didn't care.  All I wanted was for him to give me the right order,  but apparently,  they don't care about keeping customers happy."}
{"text":"I work near by and always pass by this restaurant. Today, my co-workers and I decided to try it. We are so happy we did! The tamales are very big and have that great homemade taste! We had ordered both red sauce and green sauce chicken tamales. Both taste great, but beware...that green sauce is VERY spicy!"}
{"text":"I'm a Tamale critic.. I've been hunting for good tamales in this city for well over a decade. I've been to all the mexican restaurants, stores, parking lots and any place else I could find that sells them... Finally after many long and weary years my hunt is over..  I've traced the end of the rainbow to Nellis and Sahara @ Pattys Tamales.   These tamales are authentic and delicious! And I can't believe I'm saying this but ..they sell them too cheap!  I would feel much better if they raised the price. Each time I leave I feel guilty having only paid $1.50 a pop for these gems. So please sir, raise the price to $2.50 so I can sleep at night. You have the best tamales in the state and I need you to grow and prosper for many years to come."}
{"text":"Heartbroken when I came here and found out they didn't sell sweet corn tamales anymore. That was the only reason why I drove 30 minutes from Henderson to come here, but the tamales they had were good. The green chicken tamales are good, really spicy. The green sauce is spicy. I loved it. Wish they had like sides and stuff. Or at least be able to eat inside. There's no seating or tables So all their food is like takeout / take home style.   If you look at the reviews their new menu is the green one. Only 4 different choices.  Their old menu is the one with sweet corn and such that they don't have anymore. The tamales are $2.00 each. 2 tamales was more than enough for each of us, they are a pretty good size and have meat throughout the whole tamale.   Really really heartbroken there was no sweet corn because it's all in the reviews and the menu shown on yelp. If you want sweet corn tamales, the Broadacres swap meet up north has this elote spot and sell corn everything including really good corn tamales. But they're open only on the weekends."}
{"text":"Too far from me, but my co worker brought some in to work and I loved it. So, since I was on this side of town, I thought I'd swing by and try their other tamales. My fave by far is the green chicken. The spicyness is perfect for me. Guy at the place was really nice and helped me make a decision of which other ones to try. It's just too bad they didn't have the pineapple one until later. Maybe next time. Hopefully they open a store on the west side also."}
{"text":"Tamales had lots of flavor and were very good and fresh....owner very nice and good personality"}
{"text":"These were some massive tamales! I ordered two but got full with one. Place is small and there's no seating so it's all to go. Pretty awesome because they have lots of pots filled with tamales all you do is order what you want and you get them nice and hot. The flavor was very good and it was really moist I tried the red chicken tamale. It's a great deal for some homemade tamales! I would have given another star but they only have one option with meat that's not spicy :("}
{"text":"Tamales are AWSOME!!! First time trying it and I will come back!  A previous review stated how she was impressed of the  cleanliness and she is 100% Correct.  I was greeted by a young man who is very courteous and professional. There's no tables to sit and eat, it's all take out. Hoping in the future they will get tables for dining. If not, I'll still come in."}
{"text":"My first time ordering from Patty's Tamales and I'm super impressed! I live half an hour away from this place and honestly, it was worth the drive getting some fresh, authentic tamales! First off, great customer service! The cashier was very nice and helpful. The tamales are only $2 each, very inexpensive plus they are huge in size. Great deal!  My favorites I tried were the Pork Tamale Red and  Chicken Tamale Red. The Red sauce was tasty and had the right amount of spice to it. The Green sauce was really good too, but I couldn't handle how spicy it was. I swear to you, my tongue was burning for a good ten minutes off one bite. I'm not a big fan of the Chicken with Brown sauce neither the Cheese with Peppers. They were alright. But overall, this place is bomb and I'm definitely coming back the next time I have a Tamale craving! :)"}
{"text":"So finally a few days ago I got to try their shrimp tamales and I was very disappointed. I expected something different than just a green chile tamale w/ shrimp in it. I also tried their rajas and both of these were too spicy. My spicy tolerance is high but for a tamale it was too much. I could not enjoy it properly and was a little bummed about it. Please tone down your spice level I would gladly give you guys a better review. Also prices are going up so I also expect better flavored tamales."}
{"text":"Okay everybody! I had to update my review for this place. They have gone above and beyond to make my experience better than before. Patty's Tamales is one of my favorite places to eat. Their location is only a couple minutes from my house and their quality of food is top notch. In the last few months they have been holding my order until I get there, instead of telling me first come first serve. They also gave me an option that I can pay in advance and they'd make whatever tamale I'd want for the next day, since they only have certain kinds throughout the week. The kid that handles the front is very friendly and efficient. He always tried his best to make things better when things didn't go as planned before. I'm really happy and grateful that they decided to better themselves with how they handle their customers. I will forever return and indulge in these delicious and inexpensive tamales. On a side note, you all have to try their beef and shrimp tamales! Go today or your life may not be complete! Thanks Patty for all you do for the local community. Keep up the good work and thanks for giving me an excuse not to go to the gym! The end :)"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Patty's and wow was I glad I did.  My San Diego neighbors got me hooked on delicious homemade tamales.  Party's definitely are homemade style tamales.  They do it right and make some amazing tamales.   We got Pineapple, Spicy Pork, Spicy Chicken, Beef and Jalapeño Cheese.  The Spicy Pork and Chicken were pretty hot but not past the heat line.  So every bite was a nice heat treat.  The Pineapple was so good.  The beef was a welcome treat from the heat of the Spicy tamales.  The Jalapeño Cheese was of course hot but very delicious.      My San Diego neighbor made some great tamales but I got to admit Patty's are mush better.  I called ahead to reserve my tamales which I highly recommend.  Patty's is way out of the way for me so better to know you are getting tamales before heading to them.  Great tamales and great people!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and I love this place. I ordered a Red Pork and Spicy Green. My favorite thing is that the spicy green was actually spicy. The flavor is amazing and the tamales are large. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Just moved out here to Vegas and I love tamales!!!!  So a few people told me about this place.  I tried the red beef and green chicken.  Red beef were good, green was too spicy.  Couldn't even enjoy it and no way could I share with my toddler.  So I guess I'll be making my own"}
{"text":"This hidden little gem is tucked away in the shopping center on the Southeast corner of Nellis and Sahara.  From the simple outside you would never guess there is such magic brewing inside.  When you walk inside there are no tables or chairs, just a counter with a menu hanging above.  Tamales, tamales and tamales is all you get.  Something to be said about doing one thing and doing it so right.  Also Spoke to the owner, who gave us a rundown of the place, was super friendly,  and helpful.    You can get a variety of different fillings for your tamales and I went with spicy pork, and the mild chicken.  With the prices beyond reasonable, a dozen for only $18.00, how could one not be giddy with anticipation to get home and start unwrapping these masa filled delights.  I must agree with previous reviews on portion size. The tamales themselves were stuffed full of meat, spices and sauce.  Only was able to eat two before I was starting to feel full.  On a good note there will be more for later.  I would have to say these are they best I have ever had.  Amazing job sir.   If your looking for a sit down and dine experience this is not the place, but if your just looking for some amazingly simple and outstanding take out; Patty's Tamales is magic in a bag.  Will be back many times over."}
{"text":"The tamales are pretty good, however the green ones are very spicy. I bought a dozen and they are so spicy I don't even think I can eat them. The other tamales I got were very good though."}
{"text":"The tamales are Fabulous! Large portion, good ratio of masa and meat selection. Simple location and CLEAN. Great customer service. Highly recommended. Yummy comfort food. Deliciosos!"}
{"text":"First of all, these are the best tamales I've ever eaten in my life! ( Sorry Grandma! )  They are huge compared to the average tamale and they are filled with meat or cheese, depending on your order, and not dry and all masa. It's definitely not a dine in restaurant, my office orders for lunch and just picks up. Cash only is some what bothersome, but to be honest if they took cards I might be over there everyday...  For the reviewers complaining about certain flavors not being available all day, My office is right across the street so we've gotten to know the owner's fairly well and asked them what the deal was. They have different ladies employed that make each of the sauces  at different times of the day or on different days all together. Everything is made fresh for that day, they don't like to hold over tamales, or sauces. They want the food to be fresh and hot, not like the kinds you could buy at any other grocery store that could have been sitting in the fridge for days or even weeks ( YIKES.) It is distinguishing factor that make these tamales better than any other fast service one out there. THESE TAMALES ARE FREAKING FRESH!!   The best thing to do is make a quick call and ask what flavors they have available before you head over to pick them up just to be sure they'll have what you are looking for. And even if they don't I would still try something on the menu because it's all delicious and flavorful anyways!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how these people get any business. I've called multiple times trying to get information from them and I've been hung up on. More than once. Thanks bro..... ok so I just called back. The man working there is very rude. He told me that he was just working the register and that's he's busy, that's why he keeps hanging up on me. So I asked if I could talk to someone in the back. He said no. I said, why not, I would like to get information about how your masa is made. He told me to go get some tamales from Doña Maria's.... woooow. What great customer service."}
{"text":"First time I came here, I ordered half a dozen, & they still managed to get 2 out of 6 tamales wrong. When it said spicy, I knew what spicy was. But these tamales are just too damn spicy. You can't even enjoy the flavor of everything else.   2nd time coming here, we ordered a half dozen again. Mainly went there to get pineapple tamales, but they always seem to be out of both sweet tamales, even when I call to ask. He gave us our bag and says $12. Hand him a debit card and swipes. Asks if we want a receipt and said yes. We get home, check the text receipt and it says we were charged $13. $1 more than what he said. Apparently they charge $1 for a processing fee. Seriously?? He didn't even bother to mention that there's going to be a damn fee! And nowhere in the shop do they have a sign that says they charge a fee for debit cards. Hey, a dollar is a dollar. They need to put signs up or tell you they're charging you a freakin fee! Because from the looks of it, they're pretty much robbing you a $1 because you don't know what you were charged an extra dollar for.  Okay baaaiiiis!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so glad I made the trip to the other side of town for these tamales! The chicken with spicy green sauce was my favorite. The masa was almost fluffy and it seriously melted in my mouth. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for takeaway tamales. I've had the cheese, pork, and chicken tamales, and have been happy with all of them. I've returned several times for the green chicken and the cheese tamales. The prices are very fair and quality is great. The only downside is consistency. Some of the tamales I've bought were \"just\" big, while others are gargantuan. There doesn't seem to be rhyme or reason with the size. Depend on your point of view, this may be annoying. At times, you'll be full with one tamale, while you might need two if you happen to get smaller (but still quite sizable) ones. Inconsistency aside, I'm a fan of Patty's Tamales and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"There's a variety of flavors and large tamales. Defiantly a good place to pick up some tamales for a party. Call a day or two ahead of time if you need a large order. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place..The best tamales I've ever tasted! The chicken w/ spicy green sauce is my favorite. It's quite addicting. I like the fast, friendly service. To go option is convenient. These are well worth the price."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 I would haven't tried the tamales I ordered but for the simple fact  1) I drove 30 mins from the other side of town SOLEY for the sweet corn tamale that they no longer make  2) prices not what's advertised on here or website.  $18 a dozen is $24 a dozen it doesn't take much to update a website or yelp."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come and try this place out. Got there at10:00am, They only had a couple of choices ready and the pork/chicken would be ready at 3pm and sweet corn at 5pm. What?? All tamales should be ready by the time they open. Spicy and non spicy. We drove all this way and left very disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"Went by this afternoon and got 18 tamales to share with my family.. Upon splitting them up, I realized they shorted me one.. I was told the total was $27, upon getting my receipt via text message.. I was charged $28. When I called the number listed on their website.. It was a cellphone, no one answered and I left a voicemail.. I still have not received a call back.. As for the the tamales; they are good.. Not dry, and taste fresh... I would have gave them at least a 4 stars if had not been for the other issues!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to this place after craving tamales for a long time.   From what I gauged.. You order tamales to go. They have big pots of them ready for the taking lol They have two types of chicken, two types of pork, they have two types of shrimp, they have a jalapeño and cheese one, and then they have a sweet one.   There's no seats so I'm assuming it's only to go orders. They take cards and cash.   Unfortunately I can't say much about all of the tamales because they only had the jalapeño and cheese ones this afternoon but they were so good! Wow! They're massive and fully packed with filling. It was better than any place I can think of to get them: a mercado like Cardenas, LINDO, Roberto's type places. It was so good. I took em home and fried them in a little oil. The masa was light and fluffy and it was just really good.  I can't wait to stop by and get some of the other offerings! The guy up front was nice also."}
{"text":"Delicious tamales for a good price! They are pretty big, so one and a half may be enough for an adult."}
{"text":"These tamales are amazing!!!! I was surprised how big they were. Good masa to filling ratio. If you're craving tamales go to this place,I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"These are some of the best tamales I have ever eaten in Las Vegas! Wow! Packed with flavor and meat. I've been wanted to try this place and so so happy I stopped it. People aren't kidding they really do run out of food so make sure to call ahead of time to see what's available.  The tamales were literally just done being cooked and damn did they smell amazing. I had a pleasant conversation with the owner while he was getting my order together. I asked him a few question about the food and he happily answered everything. The place itself is pretty empty which doesn't bother me one bit. So don't plan on eating there because they have no tables. It's all about the take out.  Today my family and tried the cheese and peppers(spicy), chicken in green sauce(spicy), and chicken in red sauce(mild). Spicy really is spicy so be aware, but it's the good kind of spice that is packed with flavors and still gives you a kick. The mild was delicious as well but I think I prefer the spicy ones. A dozen costs $18 or they are $1.50 a piece. Great deal.  I'll definitely be back to try the other flavors. The owner told me the chicken in brown sauce was his recommended favorite and I also saw they make corn with pineapple. That sounds interesting and a definite must try.  Overall great place, go try it!"}
{"text":"Best tamales in the world the people who work at the counter know me and my boyfriend really well as we come in a lot. I highly recommend this place never had tamales better"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area, had a taste for tamales, so I stopped by, and tried out just about all of them. The staff was very friendly, they also have a \"No Photos\" sign so I respected that and did not start snapping pictures. Theres really nothing to take pictures of but the menu. As it's not a \"dine in\" establishment.  Overall, I was in and out with a few dozen tamales in about 10 minutes.  Chicken Red Chicken Green Chicken Mole Pork Cheese w/ Peppers  Let me start off by saying these tamales are HUGE, and full of filling, so well worth the price.  The Masa was DENSE but very flavorful. Also the filling for all of them were also flavorful.  If I had to choose a favorite, it would be a toss-up between the cheese and pepper and the pork."}
{"text":"These are so good! So much filling, huge, very inexpensive (don't tell them I said that!). I've tried nearly all the different flavors - the spicy ones are a little too spicy for me but they are still so delicious - hang the heat!"}
{"text":"Their tamales are bigger than the average tamale and the price is amazing i haven't tried them all because they were sold out but I will be back to try the rest I had the chicken tamale omg it was good but very spicy."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how big the tamales are! Nice masa to meat ratio. It's worth paying $2 each if you're looking for a snack. They're steaming hot and taste deliciously home made. The green sauce is SPICY! Red sauce is flavorful. Friendly, fast service. I got super full after 1.5 tamales. -1 star because there are no tables to dine in, I didn't receive a fork or napkins, and tamales are too salty."}
{"text":"Love their tamales. I drive all the way across town and get at least two dozen everytime I go."}
{"text":"Did anyone say tamales? This has got to be the best place to get your tamales anytime of the day. No need to hunt the tamale lady down or worry if they taste stale like at majority of places. Paty's has warm fresh tamales with amazing flavor. I dropped by around 2pm and asked to sample the \"rajas con queso\" peppers and cheese and although a bit spicy the flavor was on point! There's no seating inside it's a pick up and go but I still wanted to try one before buying so they gave me a plate and utensils. I walked away with a dozen. 6 rajas that I picked and my mom picked another 6 variety. The green ones \"salsa verde\" are quite spicy no joke there so if you're not into spicy go with another flavor. The mole which is hard to get right was soooo good and drenched with tons of mole. That one was a favorite with me too. Place is very clean overall and the staff is really nice and helpful. Stop on by for some tamales, warm in the comfort of your home for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Tamales are delicious here, tons of flavor and never dry."}
{"text":"I patron PTamales at least once a week (sometimes more, don't judge) & have never seen Patty... not sure if she's real.  The green pork tamale is my favorite! It's insanely spicy, just the way I like it.  Everytime I walk in...I am greeted with a big smile & hello. Friendly family...GREAT service."}
{"text":"By far the best tamales I've had. Recently moving to  VEGAS from LA I didn't think we would find a good tamale spot ... and sure enough we did!!! Patty's Tamales will be our go to spot .."}
{"text":"Spiciest cheese tamales ever! Kind of ruined it for me because there was beyond too much chiles in it. The chicken ones were good. Pork were again, too spicy. Over priced for tamales - stick your abuelas you'll be much happier."}
{"text":"Tamales, tamales, tamales!! I love tamales and the fact that Patty's Tamales is so close to where I live rocks.  I originally was alerted to this place thanks to my trusty Yelp app! I had a hankering for Tamales so to Patty's we went. Don't expect much in the way of decor or ambiance this place is a bare bones hole in the wall. That's my favorite kind of place! Plus, make sure you bring CASH! You know it has to be good when they have huge bubbling pots of tamales and the little old grannies making the tamales in back. On the day my husband and I went they didn't have their full menu to pick from they only had chicken in brown sauce, pork in red sauce and sweet corn with pineapple. On our first trip in that day (yes, we went back later for dinner.) we just ordered three chicken in brown sauce. Patty's prices are also very reasonable $1.50 per tamale. We brought them home and dug in. They were enormous tamales with a layer of thin masa and filled with spicy chicken in a brown sauce. They were so moist and the flavor was out of this world! My husband, who normally doesn't enjoy tamales, asked to go back for dinner. How could I not say yes to more tamales!   On this trip we got three of the chicken in brown sauce and three of their pork in red sauce. Both are delicious! The pork is slightly spicer then the chicken. I'm definitely loving the flavor of the chicken in brown sauce the best so far. I'm looking forward to trying Patty's green chicken tamales.   They are a great east side location for some seriously yummy tamales. Bring the cash and they will have the tamales. I'm super excited to have this gem so close to me. Tamales for everyone!!!"}
{"text":"So rewind to about 5 years ago. Every time we would go to church in the east side there was a man selling tamales outside of our church at St.Anne in a cooler. I used to love grabbing a few and taking them home to eat if they lasted until we got there. Sometimes I saw him at parks nearby selling his goods. Eventually we moved out of the eastside area and we stopped going to that church because it was too far from us. When we returned here and there he was nowhere to be found. Even the business card I received from him was long gone. So finally we decided to try Pattys tamales. I was in the car with my son and my significant other ran in to grab the tamales. He told me it was the same guy who used to sell outside out church! Yes! Thank you! Gone are the days I have gone without these delicious tamales. Let's face it. Good tamales are hard to come by. Either they're dry or too much masa to meat ratio or the vice Versa. Patty is his wife. Aka Pattys Tamales!   The inside of this place is pretty bare. Nothing but a few tables and the counter to pay. Getting them to go is an obvious choice. Which is what we planned to do anyway. We wanted to try the sweet corn and pineapple but were told it was the number one seller and they ran out. I was happy the had the green chili chicken tamale. So we got a few of those a few chili and cheese and the brown sauce tamale.   The green chicken tamale is the one I would always get years ago. Perfectly spicy and filled with meat! They're not ripping you off on meat and especially at $1.50 theyre a steal! This one is my favorite!   The cheese and chile one has jalepeno and cheese. Almost seemed like an American cheese. It was good but I didn't prefer the cheese. It is spicy though so if you can't handle spicy stay away.   The chicken and brown sauce was my least fav. I believe the brown sauce is mole. I didn't prefer the flavor.   These tamales are delicious and for $1.50 each you're really getting your money's worth they're pretty big tamales! I'm so happy I found my tamale guy, We will definitely be back to satisfy our tamale cravings in the future. Hopefully next time they will have some sweet ones next time!"}
{"text":"The best in Vegas!!!! Worth the drive. Good flavor just like Cali tamales. I love the chicken with red sauce."}
{"text":"Can't stop eating Pattys Tamales. Always fresh and hot! The owners are always friendly & there's never a long wait."}
{"text":"This is my second time back and I was disappointed  I got the mole tamales. My first time they were awesome full of meat, mole and soft. This time they were dry, hardly any meat, and no mole sauce. I hope this was just this one tamale and not the rest of the dozen I bought for $24 plus the dollar for using my card."}
{"text":"Son los mejores tamales en Vegas que e comido los dueños son muy atentos y serviciales un lugar limpio y comfortable los recomiendo"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and really inexpensive....you can't go wrong with any of the tamales.  Corn masa is a perfect balance to the filing.  Spice is just right.  Great job!"}
{"text":"They have the best tamales in Las Vegas! My wife took a dozen to work and they ate them all! Please tell everyone about Patty's Tamales!!!"}
{"text":"I'd been craving tamales and traveled to Patty's Tamales based on Yelp reviews only to be unjustly mistreated by whomever the \"male\" worker of which all three times was the only worker at the business. Each time I visited; a Friday night at 7 pm (okay I get it's late to get the tamale of liking but all they had was the sweet corn and spicy green chicken) which I've been wanting beef and pork tamales, second attempt Saturday afternoon at 3pm- again no beef or pork and final visit was on Sunday morning at 9 am of which i asked for beef and per the male worker that he had beef but the entire pot was already sold and paid for so he couldn't sell me any.  My reply to him was that I've been here three times and each and everytime you don't have beef or pork tamales; surprisingly he rudely told me if I didn't like it I could go to Dona Maria's. WOW! I said, I don't understand how one can build it's business clientele or increase revenue if you don't stock or make enough product. I was of course offended and left and no matter how bad I crave a tamale- I WILL NEVER VENTURE OR GIVE MY HARD EARNED MONEY TO A BUSINESS THAT DISRESPECTS IT'S CUSTOMERS! It's also a possibility since I don't speak Spanish as other customers there he just felt it was okay to discriminate me."}
{"text":"I only gave them 1 star so I could comment. I tried calling earlier to ask about the different tamale options they had. The guy was incredibly rude, didn't let me get one word in, and said \"I'm busy\" and hung up. BY FAR the rudest customer service I've ever had. I didn't even get to try to this place and had an experience like this. You guys call yourselves the best of Las Vegas? Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"This is the best tamale spot on the east side of town! I've only tried the chicken tamales with the red sauce and they were delicious. I would definitely recommend this place. I can't wait to try the other flavors!"}
{"text":"Their tamales are the best. Chicken green sauce have the right amount of spiciness and chicken meats. I enjoy spicy foods so this was perfect. Its hot and fresh, ready for to go. I lived about 20 minutes away & 45 plus minutes from my workplace to this place but it's so totally worth the drive. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Tried these tamales a few years ago and they were actually really good. Went back a few months ago and they had no tamales ready so I left disappointed. Tried to give them another chance today and I called in my order this time only to be disappointed AGAIN that they didn't have much available either. The man who answered the phone was very unprofessional placing me on hold each time a client walked in. After placing my order he told me what my total would be and I was surprised because the website says a completely different thing. After telling him this he said the prices changed a long time ago so I let him know that his website should probably be updated as well since it is misleading. I let him know I would be in within the next hour to pick up my order and he said I needed to pay over the phone and after I told him to hold on for a second he told me to call him back when I was ready because he had more clients to assist as if I wasn't a client he was already helping and he hung up on me!!! ZERO stars on the customer service and they have definitely lost me as a future client."}
{"text":"The best tamales around! Love the shrimp tamales, just a perfect amount of heat and all the flavors balance so well and uniquely! A place you must go to and believe for yourself! It's heaven."}
{"text":"Really delicious, large tamales full of meat. Could be more spicy in my opinion , but great great value for the price!!!! Just so everyone knows this is a take out place, there are no seats or tables inside."}
{"text":"This place is so good i love tamales and thr guy was so nice he gave me one for free just so i could tast it because I didnt know witch one i wanted"}
{"text":"Bad service, their website says 18.00 a dozen, the guys is trying to charge me 24.00 a dozen and it says nowhere on their site. Good service would be to honor the price they have listed. To just charge someone another price and have it listed no where and won't honor a price you do have listed seems fishy. I will go somewhere else. It was a big order and you just lost business"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews. I wasn't greeted with a smile. The girl who waited on me looked dead tired. The tamales were not worth the price. Plus $1 for using debit! You want good tamales Dona M. are way better and you get chips and salsa at no cost. Save time and money. There are other places in Vegas that have better. Sorry Patty but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Up until today I was pleased with the food and now I am completely turned off with the service that I received from the owner.  It started off with me coming in for a jalapeno and cheese tamale.  I asked him if he had either and he said no he only had chicken I said ok.  I then gave him my card and asked him how much the service charge was for the product and he said it was $1 to run my card.  Keep in mind I said nothing at all and he shook his head at me and I asked if there was problem then he replied that I was \"complaining\".  I specifically let him know that I was not complaining and if he listened carefully enough I did not even say anything after he told me about the $1 charge.  He stated, \"I'm very busy right now\" and proceeded to walk away.  I let him know that I didn't appreciate his service and he snapped back at me and said that I could leave his restaurant and not come back.  I am in total disbelief by the way that the owner treated me here and for months I enjoyed his food but now I am no longer interested in supporting his business.  If anyone reads the reviews they will notice that the owner often tells customers to go to Dona Maria's if they don't like his tamales and that he will say that \"he is very busy\" and will ask them to leave.  He has been rude to several customers in the same manner and I would not be surprised if he does not stay in business.  His tamales are good but not enough to make me want to come back because his service is horrible (just read the reviews and see how ironically many of the one star reviews the customers were treated in the same manner.)"}
{"text":"I'm looking for a good tamales!!! I found this thru the Internet .. And I look all the good review thru Yelp ... And I went today order a couple of dozen... But one thing u have to order ahead of time... They are so busy and by the time you went there in the afternoon it's all gone... They have an awesome tamales so fresh and a lot of meet to I highly recommend this place..."}
{"text":"I don't know if maybe I got a bad batch or what, but definitely not the best tamales I've had. I've had friends parents make better tamales. I ordered their pork with red sauce, chicken with red sauce and sweet corn and pineapple tamales. They no longer had the sweet corn tamales. Also the prices advertised on their website is WRONG! They claimed to not have been able to fix it, but it really doesn't take much to change prices on a website.   Ok, the tamales were HUGE. I'll give them that but they were just mediocre. They corn kind of brittled away while you ate it which makes me wonder how long they've been sitting in the pots the worker was pulling them out of. The pork with red sauce does have more heat then the chicken. I didn't try the pineapple tamale, not really my thing. My kids liked the chicken tamale and ate most of it.  The facility is clean and the young gentleman working was very helpful. This place is too far out for me to travel to for mediocre tamales."}
