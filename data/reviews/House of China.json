{"text":"There's a new owner, and the quality of the food has suffered. It was never a top-of-the-line place, but it was convenient with great hours and OK food. It now lacks the OK food."}
{"text":"I have just polished off a heaping plateful of take out from House of China on Harwood. It was delicious and I'll be going for seconds right after I submit this.  I have been coming here since I was little. My Dad and I would walk here to pick it up, or we'd ride our bikes. It's the food I think about when I think about amazing, greasy (this place is no MSG!), filling Chinese food.   Their portions are large and the prices are good. There is a lot of choices on the menu and they do seafood plates, as well.  Aside from the food, n adorable little couple owns the restaurant which is mostly for take out purposes. It's quite sparse inside, with just a few chairs and a take out desk. The kitchen looks bustling with teenagers they must hire from the area.   I must really love it because I stopped eating just to write a review!"}
{"text":"Blah... Too bad this place hasn't improved... not like they care when they are one of the only games in town. This is your typical 70's scabby take out only dives. The menu has about 100000 items of which 85% of it is exactly the same with a different name.  I ordered two items on a Wednesday evening and they couldn't be bothered to get them correct!? When I called to let them know that hey the bbq pork from my \"BBQ pork wonton soup\" was missing, the owner argued with me to tell me that he made it and definitely put it in.  To only recant this when his wife yelled something in Chinese at him in the background. .likely something along the lines \"here it is in the microwave\" as the won tons were rubber.   I would avoid this place and go else where.  Fresh is not what you will get."}
{"text":"Great customer service and a wider selection of food. I had it delivered and my family enjoyed every last bite!"}
{"text":"If there was zero stars - I would provide that. - dreadful nuked food (microwave) and from boxed typed preparation - wonton soup like dishwater heated up - every dish also tastes the same - can't tell the difference between a gravy and their black bean sauce.  If you want good Chinese Kings Wok is good - skip this place  - save your money and save your taste buds.  DREADFUL food....I have no idea how this place still stays open"}
{"text":"OFFICIALLY WORST OF THE WORST! EVEN the CAT wouldn't eat their food!  \"fried rice\"- rice & soya sauce (bland, no flavor) \"chili chicken\"-looked like soup with plum sauce \"spring roll\"-looked like dog food  Paid $40 dollars for garbage!! i wouldnt EVER recommend for Anyone TO GO HERE! I got sick the next day! Dont know how they are still in business.   save yourself some money and dont risk your health. **Go someplace better**"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food, ordered some food for delivery and it was all very delicious. Will definitely order from them again"}
