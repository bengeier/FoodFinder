{"text":"This place is HALAAL  Omg the crispy ginger chicken and/or beef is amazing.  OMG those sauteed onions in the dish are like a song on your tongue!  All the dishes here are good!  I recommend it."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant yesterday for dinner and found the food to be very tasty. The quantity was also enough. The restaurant was clean and the service pleasant.  The price was also qute reasonable. This was our first visit to the restaurant and definitely not our last."}
{"text":"Its a nice place very close to Warden subway station. Great Hakka Chinese place! Its got a good sized seating area however the place itself could use some updating in terms of the decor.  The food was great!  The Chilli Chicken was the best i've had in a long long time. All other options were okay but the Chilli Chicken was truly exceptional!  ps: its Halal"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD MY FAVOURITE PLACE IN THE WORLD JUST CLOSED DOWN GUYS :( it's not like they even had bad business.. Anyway guys so they moved to 4000 steeles @ Weston Rd and I'm pretty sure they already had a location.. I hate life guys"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I love it! the food is not bland and so flavorful ! I love that they don't overkill with so many things! Service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good food, good quantities. Staff is a bit impatient and uptight, they tend to hurry you. Better Hakka Chinese is available in Scarborough, this one is so-so."}
{"text":"I had: the Manchurian chicken special. Sucks that our unofficial family resturant closed down :/"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their food is hakka style and we always used to hit up this spot for lunch whenever we are in TDOT. The foods are prepared really well, Hot and Sour soup is the best i had and lots of good memories. I miss this place. Looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"I love this place...the food is absolutely scrumptious...my favorite is the lunch special...for 5.75 you get rice, chicken/fish/vegetables and a Choice of spring roll/soup/pop...and the quantity is really good....this is a place you definitely want to try out."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, but it seems a bit oily for my liking."}
{"text":"Before I even get into the food, I really wanna say that I appreciate the service at this place. The servers are indeed attentive, as someone mentioned below, and always try to treat you right. Also the atmosphere is cozy, romantically-lit, and clean! Okay now the food lol.   They have many dishes, mostly hakka and thai. From my few trips to this place, my favourite dish thus far is the Manchurian veg pakora dish which includes veg pakoras with a hot (HOT) gravy served on steamed rice. This is one of their spiciest dishes I suppose, because it was really spicy! Although I was struggling with the hotness of this dish, I really enjoyed the flavour! Would rate 4/5 but its really spicy lol.   They also have a great pad thai. Its tangy, nutty, and not spicy this one. Plus portions are large, I usually can't finish my plate.   They also serve soups, and the sweet corn is my go-to favourite. Its gentle, mild, and sweet lol. They also have a hot and sour soup, but I prefer the sweet corn soup any day.   Overall its a nice and comfy place for hakka/fusion food and worth trying at the least. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Great customer service!! Quite slow for a Friday night but mind you we went at around 8:30pm so it was after normal dinner hours.   Our meal was delicious. We got the Hakka style noodles, chili chicken, and ginger beef. The ginger beef was amazing and crunchy! If I went back it would be for the ginger beef for sure. The other dishes were good but nothing I couldn't get elsewhere.   Good eats for sure!"}
{"text":"A vegiterian pal came to visit and took us to Wok with yu, up the road from our house because they serve a variety of Hakka Chinese Food - including a fair menu for non meat eaters.    The spice is authentic, it's a wonderful mix of chinese food with a slight Indian Flare.  The portions are very generous - hubster and I split the vegitable soup for 7 bucks to start- a simple taste, but none the less tasty, followed by Singapore rice noodle - has a curry flavour and ample bits of shrimp, chicken & veggies.  Can be made spicey or less spicey - just tell them what you want.  That was 8 bucks- we split it too, ad still have food to take for left overs for lunch the next day!  if you pickup/takeout the order and pay cash you'll get 10% off.  The restaurant lack charm/ambiance  but it's not Brutal either - just ho-hum.   We're kind of addicted now.  We had family over and ordered the \"family specials\" dinner for 4, which fed 7 and contained a vast variety of generous portioned dishes for a low price.  All were satisfied and it led to a happy evening & maintained a full wallet."}
{"text":"Great service. Deceiving from outside. Nicely built and maintained. Corn soup was good. Hot and sour was ok. Chicken and beef sizzler items were tasty. So was the chicken with black bean sauce. Good fried rice and good noodles. Food is good. Service is great. And kulfi in the end is an excellent compliment to all the different types of flavour the taste buds went through. Will visit again for sure"}
{"text":"Hi there, it's a pretty decent place to have lunch and dinner. I visit it almost everyday for lunch since it's really affordable and food taste fresh. They do offer huge portions even for lunch special. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. Have a good one! Eh forgot to add its very quite and clean inside which is usually not the case for Hakka places!"}
{"text":"This place was disgusting  The food was slimy and so oily   The soup was some red broth with nothing in it  The chow mien wasn't fully cooked the chicken was still pink and the noodles soggy and cold"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Hakka Chinese. I ordered the hot garlic chicken. Very tasty with great service. Came with a side wonton soup, spring roll & fried rice. Great value & really fast service. I'd definitely do his place again!! You gotta go if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Visited the place with high hope after seeing the four star rating. Food was cheap and tasted cheaper. We tried three dishes.  The sweet and sour fish was okay, but a bit on the sour side with too much sauce.  The ginger beef tasted pretty much the same as the pepper steak, both were bland.  You can get the same spring rolls in the supermarket.  All in all, a :( experience."}
{"text":"Ordered via Just-eat.ca & I am always a happy customer! Whenever I order, the estimated 60-70 mins delivery time however my food always arrives piping hot in 40 mins!! I usually order a two-person set meals. From my experience either set meal (spicy or non-spicy) can be shared between 2+ ppl (so the portions are great). Apart from the amazing food, the delivery guy ALWAYS delivers to my apartment door (which I find a rarity in most take out places). Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"OK food wish they would follow instructions on the food prep such as well done but other then that it's good for the price"}
{"text":"Craving Hakka food, 2 of us dropped in yesterday for a lunch. The menu is pretty limited...no where as expansive as other places I've been to. We both opted for lunch specials.  I ordered General Tao Chicken($6.99), with fried rice ($2 extra) and a spring roll My friends ordered Chilli Chicken, with fried rice ($2 extra) and a spring roll. We also opted for an order of Pakoras ($3.99 for 5) . Let's start with what came out first. A greasy, uninspiring spring roll. It was a huge disappointment. Sirrachi Sauce helped take it up a notch, but it was pretty standard fare. The pakora's were not what I'm used to. Although we ordered chicken, I think we were given vegetarian, as there was nary a piece of chicken in it. It was mostly batter with a few green chilli peppers thrown in for good measure. I love hakka pakora's and I would say these were the worst I've ever had. My General Tao chicken was a generous amount. It started off sweet and the heat gradually built. It wasn't over the top spicy, but I added sirrachi sauce to help it along. The chicken was pretty lean, so there was little fat. Portion size of the rice was gigantic. Rice was good. My friend's chilli chicken looked more like curry chicken (yellowish colour) in a gravy (I prefer my chilli chicken dry). It was very spicy (we each tasted the others meal). He enjoyed it but due to the huge portion size, couldn't finish it. Service was super. The waitress was attentive and friendly. Would I go back? If in the area and had a craving for \"fast food\" style hakka, then maybe...but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Wok With Yu is right off of Warden Avenue with windows looking out onto the street. Like a lot of the stores in the area it shares the building with a couple of other restaurants. Inside was a big square box with a selection of booths and tables and little bit of Asian-styled low key design. The menu featured a host of Chinese inspired items and a selection of Hakka styled dishes at reasonable prices. We ordered a selection of dishes including some hot & sour soup, some veggie and shrimp pakoras, the Manchurian tofu and the garlic shrimps. The food which is generous in portion size (larger than we expected for the price) arrived quickly and efficiently and although the food was heavy on the sugar and corn starch it was delicious. It was a pleasant new experience for us all."}
