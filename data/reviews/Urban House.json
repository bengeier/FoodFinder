{"text":"Comtepenary atmosphere with dive prices... craft beer for 5.75 a 20 oz pint and most of the menu is under $8.  Food is good.  Pad Thai for the price is awesome !"}
{"text":"Great food, and great service!  The French Toast Grilled Cheese really hits the spot on both the savory + the sweet notes. Will be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Right across the brickhouse cider place located right on Queen E. Has a very small patio- able to hold 6 people. Bathrooms are in the basement. Service was fair but it was also not busy at all when we went. Has a fair selection of beers on tap. Nachos were decent, but very oily. $5.75 per pint of beer. Had a nice relaxing afternoon here."}
{"text":"We came here for a breakfast at around 1:00 in the afternoon after a bad experience at another area restaurant. The place is new and surprisingly nice, as you can't really tell from the outside. Our server was friendly, seasoned, and courteous. We told her about our fiasco attempt at a breakfast before stopping there, and she brought out our meal fast and it was delicious, fresh and under $8.00 for their Classic eggs with fries and salad.  The decor is dark and delicious with a bright front window to check out the scene.   Will definitely be back to try out a lunch and dinner here."}
{"text":"In love! Cute restaurant, good food, good service, great ceasers. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I popped in here recently for dinner. Ar first, there was only one other customer in this restaurant which didn't inspire confidence. The place looks small from the outside, but that is deceptive. Inside it is spacious and there are many tables; however, with only two tables occupied, the place felt a bit lonely, and I wondered how long Urban House would be around. After all, this location seems a bit cursed considering the number of businesses that have opened here and closed their doors over the decade I've been in the hood.   The menu is very eclectic and it was hard to choose. My friend and I ordered the chicken schnitzel sandwich; I had fries and he had salad. I must say, I really enjoyed both. The fries were cooked to perfection as was the chicken. The breading of the schnitzel was crisp and well seasoned and the meat was nice and moist.  By the end of our meal, the restaurant had gradually filled and it no longer felt like a ghost town. When I got the bill, I concluded that this place has an excellent chance in this hood. For good food, this price point is low! Two sandwiches with sides and one pint of cider only came to $28! That's awesome! I will be back!!!"}
