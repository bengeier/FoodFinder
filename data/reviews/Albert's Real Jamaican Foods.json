{"text":"Oxtail and the jerk chicken are my go-to. Price is very reasonable given the amount of food that comes out on the plate and the quality of the food. Oxtail was tender and meaty unlike a lot of places I've tried in the past and although lacking the proper kick, the jerk chicken was juicy and tender.  Their fried chicken is O-K. It's cheap but I wouldn't really go for that again... If meat-only or the meal option (comes with your choice of meat + rice + peas + coleslaw) is too much food for you, their veggie pattys are great for a little snack.   Obviously the sass that gets handed to around here by the grumpy older ladies isn't much to write home about but it is part of the package and the charm of this place... I think. One word of advice: know what you want to order and make the order very simple. There tends to be a lot of confusion if the order becomes a bit longer/complicated."}
{"text":"I love the food. It tastes great  a little more pricey than the average west Indian restaurants but large serving size. I love their soups, oxtail and rotis. The customer service is on the poor side though. Don't know if the women serving are tired but not once do I see a little bit of enthusiasm at all. It is like we are bothering them,. When Albert is there, it is much better.They could be more efficient when taking orders to prevent line ups. Still going to come back for more."}
{"text":"The food is good - especially the jerk chicken.  As other reviewers have noted, it is authentic Jamaican, and that is what you should expect.  Skip the fried chicken, though, and go to the Stockyards down the street for that.  Since the renovations erlier this year, there is a small seating area, but we usually do take out.  The service isn't perfect, but the folks there are nice enough once you get to know them.  And Albert is very nice and often asks customers about their meals.  It is true that some of the customers are a bit odd, but they just reflect the neighbourhood.  Not everybody lives in Forest Hill!  Go for the food and forgive the service!"}
{"text":"2x words, Yah Mon!  This place has the best beef patties, bar none. I love the food here, and I'm not too partial to west indian food usually. Very affordable, very tasty, and it right beside the dutch dreams, an amazing ice cream store. Highly recommended! Try the chicken roti."}
{"text":"I spent two years eating here twice a week.  One of my favourites.  Sad to move away from it.  Very friendly and hilarious owner."}
{"text":"Good food. Good location. Get the fried chicken dinner, only $9.50+ tax mon-friday!"}
{"text":"This place has gradually depreciated it's service and food quality since it's \"upgrade\" to the bigger location, despite maintaining pretty exorbitant prices.   The rice and peas left something to be desired. The roti filling (veg, chicken AND goat) is under seasoned and basic. The quality of the oxtail varies based on the day of the week you pop in. The soup is the winner on this menu.  Service is awful, popped in and Albert himself was more interested in maintaining his phone conversation behind the counter than serving his customers... This place used to be a real gem before they went and turned it into something bigger- which goes to show that if something isn't broken, please do not fix it. I've rated 3 stars out of past experiences here, been coming since the early 2000's but this place needs to get it together."}
{"text":"I went to Albert's with my wife and another couple to try the roti which I heard was among the best in the city.  However living not too far from Island Foods, Pat's Homestyle Carribean, and Ghandhi's it was a tall order for Albert's.    Too tall as it turned out.  The filling was tasteless, the chicken had sporadic bones and gristle throughout, and let's just say the staff and clientele did not exactly make us feel at home, unless home is a penitentiary.    There was a family dining there and they were saving some seats.  When my wife was looking for a couple of seats for us the matriarch of this clan made it very clear (by slamming a rolled up newspaper on the table!) that none of the seats in her immediate environs were available.  So the 4 of us shared 3 seats, which was rather awkward to cut and eat roti!  As I glanced over near the end of my meal I noticed that said Big Mama Bear DID in fact need the extra chair as she likes to have somewhere to rest her elbow.  At this point I realized she wasn't being at all unreasonable and got back to fishing the bone out of my roti.  The food was cheap is probably the only plus going for Albert's.    All in all, never goin' back.  Also, big shout out to Pat's Homestyle just west of Ghandhi's, in my opinion the best roti in the city (so far).  Way cheaper than Ghandhi's and Pat is an absolute gent too, check it out.  That reminds me, time to Yelp Pat's!"}
{"text":"I come here once every few months, and the food has always been great. My favourite is the fried chicken dinner, they pour some stew beef gravy over the chicken & rice & beans, which makes it really excellent.  I've even spoken to Albert a couple of times - really nice guy, just hangs out sometimes in his restaurant, talking about his food, about traveling, whatever. Very chill."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the chicken roti. Sauce could have been thicker but the pepper sauce was good. The double was heated up in the microwave which is disappointing but was good enough.  Albert was there and he's a big personality and a lot of fun but man that older lady is scary."}
{"text":"The people who work there are nice and friendly. The food was terrible. I feel embarrassed that they brand there business as real Jamaican food and it is far from. They boil the oxtail until it look like mush (similar to baby poo) There food has zero flavour only someone who is either not Caribbean or does not have any taste buds would go there.   The cashier informed me that people come and hang out close to closing time so they do not allow anyone to stay after a certain time. I am now under the impression that those people were homeless and this is their hang out spot because of its lack in quality and respect from the locals.   Only Meal + beverage = $20.00"}
{"text":"I have been going to Alberts since the early 90's  and the vibes are still the same FRIENDLY and Relaxing. And the food remains Delicious FRESH and did I say delicious. They stick to the true Jamaican recipe and never sway from it.  I will always recommend this as toronto's BEST Jamaican Take out restaurant !!!  I suggest the red peas soup on Fridays and Mondays  The OXTAIL is to die for ! The price may seem steep BUT the portion definitely is worth every cent !!!"}
{"text":"If the service was better I'd have given this place 5 stars. LOVED the food, especially the jerk chicken. If you can put up with apathetic people helping (for the most part - some of them are actually very nice), then check this place out."}
{"text":"The place is ok it's clean. The service was horrible. They were unorganized and rude. For the price your paying the servings were really small. The food was good though. For two orders of jerk chicken and one ox tail I paid 45. I wouldn't go back. You can get the same thing for a lot less at any other Jamaican restaurant."}
{"text":"Gosh when I think about this place makes me want to eat a roti. They make the best chicken roti I have ever tasted. Its perfect for me since I don't like food to spicy. I always order a side of coleslaw which is always fresh! The staff is really sweet as well love visiting here I visit often!"}
{"text":"Delicious food served up simply.  Agree that it isn't a place where you are going to have a long, lingering meal, but that isn't why you come here.  I was luck enough to sample both curry and jerk chicken, oxtail, rice and beans, and a beef patty.  All the food was delicious with the right amount of heat.  Albert was very friendly and half the clientele knew him by name.  I don't know what A.S. was thinking but I don't think he was at the same place I was."}
{"text":"Ordered the stew beef diner Wednesday night and was very disappointed.  I got home home opened my diner to sit down and eat and to my surprise 3 small pieces of beef , 1 of which was mostly fat and grizzel and the rest of the container rice n peas and the cost  $15 +tax. But that's not the worst of it I've been sick with food poisoning ever since and it's now Friday. .   I will never give my business their again.low quality food, expensive prices and many trips to the washroom."}
{"text":"I really like their Jerk Chicken dinner. I have actually only ever gotten that one meal becuase I like it so much. Not very spicy.   The portions are very big, I've never finished it! I always need more coleslaw though. Definitely check it out, it's delicious. Best for take out, rather than eating in."}
{"text":"I thought I should try the newly renovated A's to see if things had improved.  The staff remains as surly as ever and the food, as if it were possible, is even worse.  I went for the soup and my partner went for the oxtail.  Both were far too salty and flavourless, to the point that it was hard to recognize the broth base.  With all the other really good Jamaican joints up on Eglinton and near St. Clair, this is the last time for me at this place."}
{"text":"I stopped by Albert's Real Jamaican Food (542 St. Clair W @ Vaughan)  this month and picked up a box of frozen cooked Michidean Jamaican patties.  I've always considered the Michidean brand to be a premium Jamaican patty, right up there with Randy's.   I wanted to recreate the magic at home - a tall task considering all the variables in play.   I followed the oven instructions to the tee - 350 degrees in the oven for 5 minutes... But the patty was still super COLD... and FROZEN, especially on the bottom. Drats -so much for quick and easy.   I also tried the microwave technique - 40 seconds. We all know what happened there - soggy and chewy.   Why do these instructions lie to you???  The best attribute of a Michidean's patty - the crust: so flaky and buttery!  Something I wasn't nearly achieving at home. The method that most closely aligned with my expectations: microwave for a minute and then toast it.   This time I added mozzarella cheese inside - The Custom... I know, not very Jamaican!"}
{"text":"I always see good reviews about Albert's Real Jamaican Foods. I ordered Oxtail stew and it was $18. I thought it was expensive, but people from Caribbean said $18 was pretty good price for Oxtail stew. I tried first time Oxtail stew. Ox tail stew did not have meats and their main things in the stew were bones. I did not know it. It was very spicy. I did not know whether it was tasty or not, but it was what it was."}
{"text":"I recently had a takeout meal here and I was not impressed. I got to the restaurant at 11 PM and I knew that the food sitting in large metal containers would probably no longer be that fresh. However, it was late and there were no other options so I decided to go with goat curry. As expected, it tasted like it had been sitting there for the entire day and it was pretty bland for a curry. Maybe some of the other dishes are better but this one failed to inspire."}
{"text":"First of all the food is perfect but the service is the complete opposite, almost making you feel guilty ordering to the point where I feel like I have to fill in an application , pass the interview, than wait for a call for my first shift than make my own food in the back and than quit . and repeat these steps as often as I wanna eat here to avoid the extreme head nodding service. They make you feel like your too lucky to even eat their food."}
{"text":"Came in expecting great food and received the opposite. A large taciturn woman got angry when we did not immediately order even though there was no one in the place. We got the jerk chicken dinner which came with coleslaw and rice. Everything about the meal was slightly off and really expensive. And we were drunk so you know it was bad if we couldn't eat it. Do not come here it would be a mistake."}
{"text":"Real good jerk chicken with beans and rice, oxtail gravy. I'll never understand why such simple food is often under-prepared, under-portioned and over-priced, but it is simply so good when it's right on."}
{"text":"Soooo from Hamilton, we searched.. nothing  nice in town. We randomly searched Jamaican food restaurant in Toronto and found ourselves here.   FIRST!.. amazing customer service. Such nice people.. and sooooo homey. NOT fancy but sooo real atmosphere.. and i like that soo much  Quality of food!... 10/10!!!.. soo tasty.. everythi g appropriate.. nothing excess... the coleslaw was my fav!!....  Definitely visiting when next im in the neighborhoodaa"}
{"text":"Food here is delicious but after reading an article in the star about the calories of my favourite jerk chicken dinner I think I need to restrict myself to treating myself to alberts not making it a weekly habit. I absolutely love their rice and peas with oxtail gravy and their plantains !! Nice assortment of cakes and drinks that you can't find in other places. You can buy their sauce as well. There's alcoholic beverages too. Be aware they only take cash and so you have to use the ATM in the door. The wait can be quite long but there is a tv with cp24 always on so that helps to distract you. Also no AC for those who sweat easily. Menu has student special until Thursday of the week. Prices are quite high but worth the taste."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food ever , sometime can be busy but is always pretty fast. Jerk Chiken epic! Also try the Beef Roti!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, authentic, not too spicy, and the portions are enormous. Oxtail, jerk chicken, curry chicken, and curry goat are must-try. They carry all sorts of imported Jamaican products, including the rare-spotted Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. Yes, the service is curt - learn to respect cultural differences."}
{"text":"I only ever order the curry chicken here , which is amazing :) large curry chicken ( no bone ) and extra dumplings .  Can't vouch for any other food here ."}
{"text":"Well was in the area so decided I would pop in for lunch and see if things had gotten better.  Alas this is not the case.  The location is nice, it is clean and appealing but that said i would rather have the hot crapped Albert's of years ago when it was truly something great.  I had the boneless chicken roti and a ridiculously small side of coleslaw that was over priced.  The Roti was so tuff that the fork bent while trying to eat my lunch.  there is no hot sauce on the table and when you ask for it they give you some homemade crap in a ketchup size cup that is the colour of strawberry jam and nowhere near hot enough.  The staff is the same and all I can say is ALBERT RETIRE YOUR MOTHER she spins on a dime friendly then b*tchy then friendly then....  There are plenty of good roti place now in the city, I would suggest Albert take a tour and see what they are doing soooooo wrong.  Think this is my last visit to what was once an old fav."}
{"text":"I got to try the their jerk chicken dinner with rice & peas and coleslaw.  The jerk chicken was cooked to perfection.  It was moist and juicy with tons of flavour.  My only complaint (and it's a minor one) was that it could've used a bit more heat and it seemed to be missing the scotch bonnet peppers.  But I wasn't overly disappointed because the chicken was bursting with so many other flavours.  The rice and peas (nicely smothered with gravy) were also cooked to perfection.  The coleslaw was somewhat forgettable but I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the real deal for anyone that lives close to this neighbourhood. Used to live here in the early 2000's when the spot was a small shop and I used to live off their ox tail and rice. Everything is extremely delicious and the service and conversation always fun."}
{"text":"The patties taste great but the jerk chicken dinner will give you gut rot for a few days."}
{"text":"You walk in on a Sunday night and there's this huge lineup and it's no wonder because the old woman behind the counter is moving at her own god damn pace thank you very much as she assembles to-go packs and shouts orders to the kitchen and no one is smiling but the soca music makes you subconsciously start doing these tiny little jumping twerks (still no smiles) as you wait for your giant vegetable dinner plate that could feed a small family and you immediately regret ordering that extra double and Red Stripe but you feel warm and satisfied as you step out into the chilly night."}
{"text":"Been comin here for years, almost always order the oxtail or roti. One day when I'm feeling adventurous I'll try one of the fish numbers I've seen.   Best jamaican food in the city for portion size & quality.   I don't care if the service is curt or flat, don't need to have my feelings stroked when I'm ordering take out."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent. The jerk is not a hit you in the face mass of flavours but always pretty good. The oxtail is my jam. When I shan't a good hit of tender and flavourful meat it's a must stop.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This is a staple for me whenever I'm staying at my uncle's place at Wychwood park.   It's probably not as cheap as I would have thought based on the kinda ghetto look before the recent reno, but regardless, it's nice to get some nice Jamaican food in that somewhat poshy hood.   It's also just nice going to an independent place and it smells so yummy...  I have gone for years and will continue to do so as I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Kinda on the pricier side for Carribean food. However the ambience and dine in experience was great. Have had better quality food but the overall cant complaint. Food was good."}
{"text":"We've been going to Albert's since 1999, when there two locations. One on Queen and Bathurst, now Pat's. The food is not as spicy as it used to be. I liked it before when it was.  Maybe now they appeal to a different customer?   The 3 stars are for the prices. A $10 dish in 1999 is now close to $20. We haven't seen that kind of inflation in Canada.  A 1999 $10 bill is $14.41 in 2018 according to the inflation calculator. With the greater ethnic population in the city there is more availability of goat and ox than ever before. Prices have increased, yes...but not doubled. I went in a couple of weeks ago and bot two meals with a side of rice and 4 festivals. It cost me almost $60!  I had to do a double take. $60 would have been $42 in 1999 which would have bought us a lot more.  Instead it was take out at restaurant full service sit in prices.  As much as I like the food, even if it's not as spicy as it used to be, it is too expensive for take out even for a once in a while treat. To compare, the Jamaican full service restaurant at the posh neighbourhood on Avenue Road, ScottHill Caribbean cost us under $70 taxes and tip in, for two delicious full meals two sodas and a generous portion complimentary starter soup.  The food was delicious, the service was great and they had live entertainment!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistent, but average. At least they serve fish, which is more than I can say for most Jamaican restaurants in the city of Toronto. Sigh."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I usually get the roti here. It's excellent. Extremely filling. Food 5/5. Some inconsistencies on tastiness from visit to visit. Long wait for food sometimes. A neighborhood staple for many years."}
{"text":"Yup.  Thats a 5 for me. Everytime Ive come in here, the place hits the spot.  Jerk chicken, and the roti.... Yumm Yumm Yumm. too bad i don't live near here anymore.  However everyone always talks about Alberts and with good reason. The staff seem friendly too, and super chill.  I like their vibe."}
{"text":"Yummy roti wraps. I started eating one and couldn't stop so I ate the whole thing! It's ridiculously large - maybe 2 lbs? I heard this was the best Jamaican spot in this hood. Could very well be true. I recommend take-out as the dining area is lacking and may take away from the deliciousness of the food."}
{"text":"I always order the chicken roti here and it fulfills my roti cravings for sure. But I only come here because it's in my (current) neighborhood and was recommended to me. I had higher expectations for it."}
{"text":"I don't care if I get bad service.  I don't care if they run outta food cuz I get it. I understand the pandemonium.This food is best described as, \"delicious, succulent, knee-buckling, tender and perfection.\" The patties are flaky and baked evenly. The unattractive goo inside the patty is free of fungus unlike Patty King in Kenzo.  The pepper shrimps are controversial due to the face still being attached when you buy it. It's still delicious though. Once you crack the shrimp's face and legs off, you can eat it no problem.  They also have rum cake with the fondant on it! It was fresh and soft and everything I needed it to be! The vegetable patty is heavenly.  Oh yeah! don't eat this food in front of people. This should be a private affair.  It's an emotional journey between you and your patty, and you should really be mindful of the entire process.  Set aside a wetnap and a vaccuum; the patties are extremely flaky.  If you turn into the Tazmanian devil as you eat, it's okay--that's normal. I'm so into Albert's right now. Can you tell? If Albert was a pokemon I'd use up to 4 ultra balls to catch him.   5 Stars."}
{"text":"I've only had the Jamaican patty here a few times but I was disappointed that the filling was thin. I liked that it tastes a bit different from other patties. I'd give them a better rating if the pricing and lunch special was better. I think paying $10 for a roti at lunch is too much. I  can go down the street or across the street for better food at that price. I like that places DT offer lunch rates."}
{"text":"I loved Albert's!!!  Came here on a rainy Saturday during Salsa on St Clair. So what better to do while we wait than eat jerk chicken!?!?!?  Jerk chicken was made with Ox tail gravy i think because my friend ended up not being able to eat any of the chicken (i think he's got some kind of religious restriction? who know, more chicken for me!).  We ordered the jerk chicken dinner and two pieces of fried chicken. SO YUMMY!!!!! Jerk chicken was sauce and soft and a little spicy. I asked for potatoes instead of rice and they gave me A LOT of potatoes. Too many potatoes...  I would definitely come here again!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been twice and both times left disappointed. Very inconsistent too - 1 very rude staff, 1 very nice one. No good pepper sauce either which is surprising.  Food is average. Definitely better West Indian options in the city. Had the goat curry with rice and peas and there was barely any meat. Second go around had the chicken curry and it was a little watered down. I think Albert is more concerned about food cost than food quality."}
{"text":"This is where you'd go if you want to have some good food without the fancy dining experience. I dare say this comes very close to being worth the trek up - seeing that there is an Island Foods located only steps away.  I'll say that the first impression was not good; the lady behind the counter simply ignored me for a while and even after I ordered, didn't let me know where to go and wait for my food. When I had questions about the food (I'm so willing to open my wallet for the sake of trying new things), she told me the name  and that was THAT. Friendly is NOT in the books with that one. But when Albert is manning the spot, and if he had taken care of us, I would have instantly fallen in love with the spot. He greeted everyone with a big smile, engaged in not just a small talk, but long conversations about their affairs as if they've known each other forever(perhaps its true).-some of his regulars were his \"little princesses.\" He was helpful and friendly - completely different from my own experience with that lady who clearly wasn't aware of the words, \"smile\" and \"friendly.\"  The decor is modest - it wasn't as \"fancy\" as a restaurant but it wasn't really a Island food either - I'll give Albert props for having good lighting and spacious area and good food trays - in lime green (my fav. colour this year).  I got the king fish and my friend got the jerk chicken with Ting and Peanut Punch.  A little tear of gratefulness was shed for the abundance of Peanut Punch which Island Food was often out of.  The wait time was not long at all in comparison to Island foods - I mean I still have to wait for my food at Island food even when I call in advance, and 10 minute wait is a staple there ,even without a lineup. Here, it was about 5 minutes or so, and the fella that ordered a head got his food and was gone in a blink.  The food was SO DANG GOOD. The fish was just perfect. PERFECT. melts in your mouth. Coleslaw - was awesome- dunno if it was home made but I would not be surprised. What was mind blasting was the jerk chicken. I have had my share of jerked chicken - but this was so tender, so juicy...and even the skin was...just...just PERFECT.  In case you haven't noticed. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Food is ok but price is a bit higher compare to other jamaican restaurants in eglinton west area. They do not accept debit or any cards."}
{"text":"A busy lunch service w/ the best deal going for $7 for jerk chicken w/peas & rôtis at $12 is also a big seller. I got the curry goat dinner at $17.50... a little steep as compared to other restos nearby like Gerry's. Not bad, B+ would be even better if there were lunch specials."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just psychological but I feel it's not as good as when they just had the little bunker with take out and a couple of seats.  I remember getting Roti's about the size of small seat cushion almost to thick to bite or cut through with a plastic knife!  Seems prices went up and portions got a little smaller after the expansion.   The food is excellent quality but the curry is on the \"mild\" side (not say bland but...) I'd say it caters to those who don't go for much heat or strong herb fragrances. These days I sooner choose places with more aggressive spicing, but on the other hand Albert's is a place you can bring friends or relatives with more timid pallets. The Oxtail is very comforting, and whatever that brown soup with dumplings is, it's really filling and warming on a winter night,   Not my personal fave on the Curry & Jerk, but I still go once in a while, there's still a nostalgic feeling to the location and area, the people are really nice, the place is kept much better than some competitors, plus I like to support spots that are open real late and have parking."}
{"text":"A wide selection of dishes available from goat roti to jerk pork . The rice N peas is very tasty and so is the jerk pork , lots of flavour going on . Festivals and dumpling available . Good patties too, you can also have one on a coco bread . Been coming here for a few years now and you won't hear any complaints from me ."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 6 stars to the jerk chicken from Albert's, I'm drooling just thinking about it!  I having a food coma each time I'm there because I can't stop eating as it's sooo yummylicious! I've never tried anything else than jerk chicken because I know it's gonna be amazing and I'm so scared to be disappointed by the other stuff hahaha  The place looks cheap by the outside but don't judge the appearance, all the people a know that have been there and myself will highly recommend the jerk chicken"}
{"text":"Quality Jamaican food in Midtown Toronto. This place feels like a dive bar...once you walk inside it feels like you're back in Jamaica. The food was TASTY...I was told to try the SPICY BEEF PATTY and it truly was phenomenal. Also this place is VERY cheap so don't worry about breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Great Jerk and other selections. Good size seating area. But for me they should have a smaller size meal option, all you can buy is a large meal which will come to $11+. Also the service isn't the friendliest."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, the Oxtail dish here is second to none in all of the GTA. You will be hard pressed to find a more traditional Jamaican dish once thought found only in rural Jamaica. We're talking fall of the bone Oxtail that you wanna suck the bone dry from. Their fried chicken is also some of the best around. They may as well even have the best rice and peas too! that's how good this place is. It's just something magical for your taste buds when you pair it all with their signature coleslaw. Not only that, but their patties and coco bread will have you coming back for more. Remember it's cash only so come prepared!"}
{"text":"I have spent many hard earned dollars on delicious, salty fish, patties, and chicken rotis. This place has loads of charm, especially due to the often very grumpy woman behind the counter. The super yummy ginger beer is a highlight as well. The hours are amazing for post-night out eats.  The plantains are sometimes dry and chewy. The prices are a little excessive and the parking lot can be a bit of a mess.  That being said, it is the restaurant in Toronto I have frequented most and I miss it now that I've moved away! The next time I'm in Toronto, I'll definitely be in for more roti and ginger beer."}
{"text":"The Veggie Roti ($7.50) is massive but unfortunately quite bland. The filling consists of potato, cabbage, and what looked like a canned or frozen mix of peas, carrots, and corn. The filling was seriously lacking in the flavour and heat department. After drowning the roti in hot sauce it was alright."}
{"text":"It's good food.  And yes, you can only get it while you can.  They don't thaw from frozen, so if they run out, they run out.    It's not the kind of place to come for service- you make your order at the counter, pick it up and seat yourself- I don't think they ever had a maitre d, so excuse the service. It's a bit disorganized, but don't take it personally, the staff are trained to cook, not serve.  I'd agree with some reviewers, the quality's gone down a bit, so I hope Albert's reads these reviews and makes a few changes and brings back whatever it was that made the oxtail gravy stick to your bones."}
{"text":"We come here for the oxtail dinner because wow! Portions are generous and we normally share one meal along with 2 patties to go.  The sauce is perfect, for my taste at least. I mean as long as we've got tender pieces of this succulent part, still in awe of how a tail has so much good meat!! Fall off the bone good!  Rice is moist with plenty of beans, although I get most of it as hubby watches what he eats and steers clear from beans to avoid painful gout attacks.  Parking is minimal when the restaurant is busy, plenty of tables for dining in and lots of love from the staff to keep you coming back whenever in the area."}
{"text":"Luv it here.  The staff are amazing and the food is wonderful.  I usually take my mom and we love the oxtail.     Whenever we go it feels like \"home\"....  Albert, your place rocks!!"}
{"text":"Although the place seems really popular I found the roti tasted freezer burned and the filling was just ok. If you want real delish roti I suggest Pam's on Bloor at Ossington."}
{"text":"Will the real Albert please stand up?  Alberts is an institution that anchors the ethnic smorgasboard of St. Clair West restaurants, Alberts closed last year for a renovation/expansion. The new space is sleeker. Instead of entering off St. Clair itself, you pass through a side parking lot, through what used to be a separate (very confused) restaurant.  It looks great, but is less friendly to those who would pick up a patty along the way.   Speaking of which, the patties are delightful; fresh and flaky at all times of day. The feeling is typical alleged beef, but incendiary spicing makes you feel like you've truly lived.   Meals are wildly inconsistent. On one visit, the jerk chicken is shredding-tender, the skin slightly crisp and the meat moist and flavourful. On another it's a cold, hard, soggy mess.   Ditto for the pork, minus the skin. Rice and peas may be hot and fluffy or ice-cold and stodgy. Slaw is uniformly pleasant; its sweetness cutting the rich and spicy proteins and starch.   Chicken Roti is similarly schizo. Piping hot curry with bright veggies and unctuous chicken in a light, crepe-like shell one day, a tepid, mealy, sinew-ridden disappointment the next.   Service is much better when Albert himself is manning the shop. He greets his customers with a broad smile and a bonecrushing handshake, and you leave feeling glad you came. Other servers are dour, with eyes cast downward and surly expressions. Place an order and it's like they're doing you a favour loading your styrofoam tray.   Bonus points: Ting grapefruit soda. Sure it's available at Loblaws nearby, but what better way to wash down your meal?"}
{"text":"Fantastic patties.  Good roti.  Jerk chicken is passable.  Not terribly expensive.  You can find better a bit west on St Clair, or defintiely at Eglinton and Oakwood but by and large Albert's is fine.  Always smells great."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I got the jerk chicken lunch special. All i have to say is SAVE YOUR MONEY. The tiny meal cost me about $8+ with tax (which is quite expensive) and a bun and cheese sandwich. The jerk chicken was so underwhelming. There was absolutely no flavour.  The best way to describe this  is like stew chicken gone bad. The rice and pea was cooked well but very tasteless also. The bun and cheese was $3.50 which is an okay price but i ended up tossing it in the garbage because the bun was ridiculously dry and i got about 1 oz of cheese at best. Fair to say i will never return or recommend this place. Again, SAFE YOUR MONEY. Ritz is 10× better and less expensive."}
{"text":"The food is good although more expensive and didn't like the flavour as much compared to other jerk places on Eglinton west. But if I'm in the area and feeling like some Jamaican food, I would come here but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Use to love coming here for beef stew. Lived in the neighbourhood for years, it was close and fairly good, especially for late night. But, ever since they took over more space the food has gone downhill! It's like since they got higher overhead they skimp on the quality of ingredients? As mentioned, I loved the beef stew, big chunks of tender beef and tasty gravy for $10 all in. Now it's over $11 and the first two I got were 70% fat! Waited few months just got another and it was 50% bone???!!! I mean 2 huge bones and little meat.   Needless to say I'm done with this place!  P.S. There is a larger lady that looks at you like you stole something? Horrible"}
{"text":"I  finally decided to check out Albert's Real Jamaican Food.  The place was packed. I maneuvered my way to the cashier and ordered Curry Chicken and rice. The lady behind the counter opened one of the large containers (the ones used to keep food warm for long periods of time) and poured my curry in small plastic container. At that very moment, I knew my food wouldn't be any good.  And I was right. The food was cold, bland and tasteless. It was a pretty gross meal.  If you want fresh food, stay away from Alberto's Real Jamaican."}
{"text":"This has a reputation as one of the best West Indian restaurants in the city and it certainly deserves it.   It is a casual atmosphere not really a place to take your date but you could always take out and go somewhere more romantic.  The food is consistently great.  The portions are generous.  I love the chicken roti and can never eat it all at one sitting. If you need something delicious and don't want to spend a lot, try the soup it starts at $3.50 for the small.  The soup always seems to have dumplings in it, yum. Another recommendation is the home-made ginger beer, delicious.  They are open quite late, so next time you have a late night craving for some really wonderful fast food, check out Alberts."}
{"text":"I've never bought into the hype that surrounds Albert's. While it's certainly an institution, I've had much better jerk. Try the oxtail, it's pretty good, although compared to home made it's just OK. For take out, it can't be beat though, and it's got great hours. The curry goat is decent, but the chicken has always been dry. Ask for extra gravy on the rice & beans. They are generous with the rice, but not always with the tasty sauce. I wish Albert would talk nicer to his staff. They seem like decent hard working people, but he can be really mean. Still - if in the neighborhood try it out."}
{"text":"The chicken roti is amazing here. Only Vena's makes one better."}
{"text":"Don't expect a five-star atmosphere when you go here. Just real down and dirty Jamaican food. I get the jerk chicken dinner. It is pretty good in my opinion - not the best jerk chicken I've had (that honour goes to myself and my BBQ). The rice and peas are usually on point - some places tend to dry out or a bad rice to peas ratio. Chicken is good too, there is a high turnaround of food at this place so don't be surprised if they reheat your chicken in a microwave.  Bonus - they have a parking lot."}
{"text":"They consistently run out of food mid day.  Also they open and close on a whim, seriously Albert has been here (canada) long enough that it's past time he change his clock  off of island time.  Food is generally good to ok  I put off writing a review because this place has been apart of the hood for so long. I have always given this place a pass.   My hope is that this review and the many like it are used by Albert and staff to improve."}
{"text":"Probably 15 years+ going here and there - went as a kid, teen, and now an adult. It'll always be my favourite oxtail and Irish moss, patties and soup when you are feeling it, plus a lot more - support them!!!"}
{"text":"what to say about Albert's ? well I do spend a fair amount of time here as they are very close to where I live these days and it does make for a quick easy stop on the way home from work with the free parking outside if its not full of cab drivers but when it comes to the food I find that the flavor has sort of been slipping the last little while. I'll nevr complain about portion size from Albert's and I do still enjoy their food but I long for the days when Albert's was one of if not the best Jamaican restaurant in the city.  I still love you though, especially that Oxtail with that gravy all over the rice & peas"}
{"text":"Food ****1/2 Service ***** Ambience ****  This is a Jamaican institution in the city.   Privileged to have gone to Alberts since 2006, I remember when they had their small storefront on St. Clair.   I used to come from the West so I'd pull a hard U-turn and arrive at their doorstep (pre-streetcad times.)  My go-to for Alberts is always 2 things: Jerk Chicken Dinner and Doubles.    Doubles are a roti with spiced chickpeas in it.  It's a great snack, vegetarian for those who need it, and easily packable/edible on the go.    I personally am not an oxtail fan (probably because I'm  the East Indian variety :) but I have bought it for a West-Indian friend a couple times and he loves it.    Anytime I'm in the area and hungry, I'll go give Alberts a try.    Sadly Dutch Dreams ice cream shop has moved a while back and is no longer neighbours.  Good thing is that they are just a couple minutes down Vaughan on the South side of St. Clair.  A perfect summer evening would be Alberts followed by Dutch Dreams.  :)"}
