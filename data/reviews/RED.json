{"text":"What a great meal, celebrated my daughters birthday and she begged to go to Red for their sashimi. Third time at the restaurant and all the food prep was beautifully presented and tasted fresh. Ryan was our waiter and was excellent, attentive but not hovering and chose the perfect wine for my wife.  His service completed a great evening!"}
{"text":"We have only been to red for lunch and the two rolls for under $10 lunch special.  We usually sit at the sushi bar and enjoy watching the chefs work.  The rolls are universally good and the service is also good.  If you like sushi and are in downtown Madison, you need to stop at Red.  I recommend giving the shrimp tempura roll a try when you stop in."}
{"text":"I went there for our dinner, and it was good.
The atomosphere is so nice, and food is delicious. their TENPURA are crispy enough  that  we were satisfied with it. 
ROLLs are kind of little bit small, I think . But totally , it was good.
Having heard it was reasonable, but I don`t think so. 
sooner or later, we will go again."}
{"text":"Following the advice of Jimmy, my fave bartender from Opus, I decided to check out this hip sushi joint.  I was not disappointed.  Jimmy moonlights (sunlights?) as a waiter here and took great care of my sister and me.  I had the unagi and spicy tuna + avocado. Delish!!  It was great sitting at the sushi bar. Only complaint (minor) was the loudness of the music.  But overall, three thumbs up.  Go ahead. Figure that one out."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Red after several years of loyalty to Sushi Moramoto. In comparison, Red's is smaller, faster, and has better, fresher fish quality. However, the price difference and smaller rolls over-compensates for the slight increase in quality. I will continue to frequent Moramoto over Red in Madison."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Terrible staff. And yes they have roaches. Grossed everyone out the waitress didnt even want to go by it. Owner did stop by and bill was on the house"}
{"text":"I ordered food to-go from here tonight, and was unfortunately disappointed. I ordered the crunchy salmon with asparagus, and got avocado instead (I'm allergic). The other rolls were just ok. I would like to try this place again, but don't know if it's worth the price tag. Oh well."}
{"text":"Being new to the Madison area from Florida I've been excited to try new sushi places, Red came recommended by coworkers and I quickly decided to check it out! I went on a Friday around 8pm, with live music happening right outside in the streets, I was shocked to be immediately seated at the bar for service. My waitress was extremely nice and gave wonderful suggestions. I saw the lychee martini and ordered one, as lychee is my favorite and I'm so glad I did! BEST lychee martini I've ever had! I also ordered the hot pork pot stickers that came with a fantastic teriyaki type sauce. I ordered the rainbow roll and a spicy Godzilla roll. Beautiful presentation and both were delicious! The overall atmosphere at Red was nice, it's dark and intimate but bustling with conversation and people having a great time. I enjoyed sitting at the bar so I could watch the chefs do their artwork of preparing all the orders! they were all very fast and clean. if you're looking for great sushi and a fun dining experience Red is definitely worth your time!"}
{"text":"Great sushi (spicy bacon roll took the show) awesome waitress (had a whoops come out to the table and she handled it like a pro even though she said she was new) and that tall highball blonde slinging drinks behind the pine kept all my senses on cloud 9 the whole night."}
{"text":"My taste buds have died and gone to heaven. 

I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and it was sooooo good.  I have been here a few times and I don't remember it being this good.  I had oysters, seaweed salad, the Holiday Roll, and some tuna belly sashimi ( I can't remember what they called it). 

The tuna belly seemed to melt in my mouth.  It was so flavorful and almost creamy even though it was only fish.  The Holiday Roll had to be my absolute favorite.  It was spicy and a little sweet.  I wish I could have it right now! 

The service was great.  We sat at the bar and the bartender served us.  My only gripe is that this place is tiny and is always packed, which is great and horrible all at once.  It is great because you know that people love the food and even though it is one of many sushi restaurants in the area, people want to come here.  It is horrible because people want to come here! There usually is an hour wait, but let me tell you that it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"After seeing that all the reviews for this place were four 5-star reviews by people writing their first and only review (as of this writing), I was a bit skeptical, especially since it opened very recently.  So I thought I'd go take a look, as everyone had such nice things to say about it.

Arrived at 11:30am on a Monday and the place wasn't very full.  About 8 people sitting down at the tables and 1 at the sushi bar.  Things got a little busier as the lunch hour progressed, but never got more than half full (if people didn't mind sitting at the bar).  Looked like maybe 5-6 staff were working, 2 of those were servers.

They have 13 tables that sit 2 people, with the majority (8-9) up against the side wall so the people on that side get a booth seat. The other 2 person tables are up front with a view of King Street.  If you have a party larger than 2 people, they just push the tables together.  However, I could see it potentially being an issue if you walk in with a large party without reservations.  The sushi bar looked like it seated about 15 people.

The decor is modern with a gray, black, and (you guessed it) red color theme.  I decided to try a chair instead of a booth, and it was comfortable enough for my bad back.  Nice sturdy wood disposable chopsticks at the table, not the ultra cheap kind you're used to with Chinese take out.

This place advertises itself as sushi/grill.

For the sushi portion, I counted 55 rolls to choose from, with assorted sushi/sashimi if you wished.  Some of the rolls were quite unique, but at least half were the \"old standards\" if you weren't feeling adventurous.  You could also get some different combos if you're looking to mix and match, or get a sushi appetizer.

For the grill, they had some hibachi offerings, but the fusion aspect of the restaurant reared its head here, as there were some pasta dishes, and you could also order your hibachi with teriyaki, Korean BBQ, or Italian seasoning (what?!).  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but it definitely wasn't expected.  If I had money to burn I might have even tried it just because I was intrigued.

They have lunch specials during the week at least (not sure about weekends) where you can order 2 rolls from a reduced list for $10, get some sushi/sashimi/roll combos for $10 and up, or go the hibachi route for $9.

Regarding liquor, they have a small bar, a wine list about a page long, a handful of sake/plum wine selections, and some bottled beer.  No beer taps.

Service was ok after I sat down.  I was greeted, told to sit wherever I wished, and handed the full menu, the lunch menu, and the wine menu.  My beverage arrived in adequate time, and then I placed my order.

I ordered the Shellfish Lover appetizer for about $10, which consists of 5 pieces of sushi, specifically: shrimp, scallop, surf clam, conch, and whelk.  The shrimp wasn't specified as Ebi or Amaebi (cooked, or raw respectively) and the server wasn't sure either and said she could check.  While I prefer Amaebi, I hadn't had Ebi for awhile so I told her not to worry about it.

I also asked if I had the option to order fresh wasabi.  After checking on this it was discovered that they only have the standard powder-based wasabi quail eggs.  That's too bad as other places in town have it and it's really so much better that I'm more than happy to spend a couple extra bucks for it.  With all of the emphasis on sushi, I was surprised they didn't have any.

For a 5 piece simple sushi order, it took 20-25 minutes.  I'm not sure what combination of factors contributed, whether the order got in late, or my order was competing with other more elaborate roll orders or what.  I don't know about your office's lunch policy, but I can't really wait over 30 mins after sitting down to get my order, unless I work a couple of blocks away.  I would have also appreciated it if the server had acknowledged the wait.

When I finally did get my order, the server told me that they were out of Japanese whelk, so the chef substituted crawfish.  You would think that since I love crayfish/crawfish that this wouldn't be an issue.  But actually it's kind of a big deal for a couple of reasons.  1) What should have happened is when the chef saw my order, they call the server over to let them know, and have the server tell me what's up and ask me if I'd like to proceed, or offer me another choice, or whatever BEFORE the food arrives prepared at the table.  This is common sense both from the customer's and restaurant's perspective as I get to revise my order, and they don't go to the trouble of making something I may refuse.  2) Ideally before each service, the sushi chef should notify the servers what's unavailable on the menu and keep them up to date if they run out of stock. 

Rating: 3 of 5 stars, deducting one star for the substitution faux pas,  a half a star for the speed of the order, and a half star for the lack of fresh wasabi.

I may stop back but I've reached my 5000 char limit!"}
{"text":"We went to RED for my birthday last night, overall the food was tasty, the real area that was lacking was the service at the table.
We came in to a 20 minute wait, no worries, we had planned for that. We waited at the bar and were given prompt service by Jon, I ordered one of the new drinks and it was amazing, super refreshing and not overly sweet. The bar staff all stayed busy the whole time making drinks, but they balanced well with taking care of the patrons at the bar top and making drinks for the rest of the restaurant.
We were sat within the 20 minute wait time, but beyond the food that is where the great experience went to good. The server never dropped his name, did not give any suggestions on the menu, did not check back until we were having to try and flag him down for the bill, and did not ask how the meal was. We ordered 4 rolls which took about 35 minutes to come out (a little longer than we expect) 3 of them were great, the only one we didn't care for was the surf and turf roll, they cook the steak on top by blasting it with a hand torch and all we could taste was the chemical/gas taste left from that. 
Overall we will be back, but we will probably eat at the bar top next time for the service."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. My boyfriend and I combined ordered the chicken teriyaki, cactus roll, surf n turf roll, edamame, and two cocktails. Overall everything was delicious except the surf n turf roll. The \"filet mignon\" on top of it looked and tasted pretty suspicious and old, which was kind of a disappointment saying as how I'm pretty sure it was the most expensive roll on the menu. I kind of suspected it after I ordered and the waitress didn't ask how I wanted it cooked.

The waitress - nice girl I guess, but overall pretty dull and didn't really talk much. Hosts/hostesses were very kind and bubbly though.

The overall restaurant was much smaller than I expected it to be. Which is fine, but I definitely wouldn't come here with a group larger than 4. I could tell the staff were having a difficult time maneuvering around. We came here at 6pm on a Tuesday night and it was crammed, but as a group of two we got a seat right away. The ambience was trendy so as long as you don't mind some noise you'll be fine.

P.S. They don't have any birthday specials. I didn't expect any, but just in case you come here for your birthday and ask!"}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in Madison. Highly recommend the Super Volcano for anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"I have to write in regards to their service recovery and poor customer service. They take reservations for parties of 4 or more but any less than that, you have to wait. When I called to ask about this policy, especially due to the below zero temperatures today, they could not do anything for me but rather said I would have to come in and see what happened. This is the sort of business that I won't go to ever again because of the poor customer service - we had their sushi once before and it was very good but I can't stand to frequent a place with a terrible manager."}
{"text":"As a dedicated sushi lover, this place exceeds expectations. The menu is extensive but not overwhelming and the servers give great recommendations. Expect a wait, but they will text you when the table is ready, giving you time to shop and walk by the capitol. Outdoor seating is available during the warmer months - and who doesn't want to take advantage of that?!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here on Saturday night. Had tuna, red snapper, and salmon sushi with three of their specialty rolls. Everything was very fresh and delicious. Even the 12 yo in the group loved it. The service was excellent. We were seated immediately (it was about 3/4 full) and our waitress went out of her way to make it a wonderful meal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been hearing WONDERFUL things about Red Sushi ever since it opened. My partner and I were really excited to celebrate our anniversary and so we called to make reservation. The host let us know that they didn't take reservations but we would be fine to come in around 8 pm on a Friday. When we arrived the hostess told us that it would be an hour wait. My partner and I were totally cool with that since we were happy to just experience everything about Red Sushi. We gave the hostess our phone number and she said she would text us when our table was ready. Since there wasn't room at the bar we left and went to Opus for drinks. After an hour had passed we checked the app (they have a website that tracks your wait) and there were still 7 people ahead of us. Once we saw this we decided to order another drink. After our third drink and 1 hour and 30 minutes later we decided to go back to the restaurant and see what gives. The hostess told us that sadly there would still be another 30+  minute wait. I'm sorry, but 2 hours is not worth it. Also I have worked in a restaurant and I have never told someone it would be an hour wait but actually it could be 2 plus hours. Shouldn't the hostess have a better idea of table times? Isn't that her job?

At this point I felt like our anniversary was ruined. All of the nicer restaurants stopped taking orders at 10 pm and we just felt disheartened. If they had told us that it would be 2+ hours we would've been disappointed but we would've understood... at that point we would have been able to go to another place. Sadly we left and went home and ate frozen pizza. Totally not what I had hoped for on a night that seemed so promising. 

My partner is a general manager of a hip downtown restaurant and sadly feels like Red Sushi can no longer be recommended to patrons looking for an exciting culinary adventure."}
{"text":"There are a few places that I have been to for sushi that I have truly liked. Red is the only place that have consistently surprised me with the variety and creativity of their rolls and most importantly the quality of fish. This is hands down the best sushi restaurant in Wisconsin. Can't wait to check out their new location!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and drinks.

Very high quality food.

Sushi is the best you'll find in Madison - still not the quality you'd find at top sushi restaurants on the west coast but getting close. We went during salmon season (August) and the wild salmon sushi was AMAZING."}
{"text":"The aesthetics of this place is impressive.  There is really no environment like it in Madison.  The fish is of great quality. The rolls are over the top and incorporate too many ingredients that take away from the flavor of the fish.  
The biggest disappointment about this place is the actual sushi experience.  If I sit at the sushi bar I want to interact with my sushi Chef. When you sit at the sushi bar at Red you place all orders with a server and have no interaction with the sushi chef.  The sushi chefs at Red are robots cranking out what ever come out of the printer.  Before I order omakase I want to know that my sushi Chef knows what he is doing and that is not an option here.
In all I recommend this place for cocktails and the hot food which is done very well.  But when it comes to sushi save your money for a better sushi experience which does not exist in Madison yet."}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite sushi place in Madison! Food, drinks, and service always excellent. Whether it's lunch or dinner I always leave happy."}
{"text":"RED is hands down, the best sushi in Madison! Their lunch specials are great, but dinner prices are so worth it, too. If going for dinner on the weekend I would make a reservation."}
{"text":"came out to visit Madison and was recommended Red sushi by multiple people. Definitely extremely creative sushi, and the flavors were right on point. My only complaint would be their appetizers which were lackluster in taste."}
{"text":"Only sushi place I've been to in Madison, and it is great! There are a lot of options, and I was impressed with their vegetarian (even VEGAN!) options. They have traditional (cheaper) rolls and special rolls, that even though they're more expensive, are definitely worth the price!

I had the Vegan roll and the spicy yellow tail roll with a seaweed salad. I was able to try the Rock n' Roll and another one with duck. All were delicious and the service was excellent. We went in for early Saturday dinner, so it wasn't too crowded. 

Just a heads up though on the restaurant as a whole, it is a smaller restaurant and you will be close to your \"neighbors\" seated next to you. Also, while the restaurant has a trendy vibe, I don't feel like any of it was necessary. The food speaks for itself. And it's in a great place off the square to bar hop afterwards!"}
{"text":"Cozy ambience, friendly servers, great crowd, reasonable prices. Did I mention wonderfully fresh and delicious rolls? If you are looking for great sushi downtown, you just cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and extremely friendly staff!  I recommend sitting at the sushi bar! Being someone from out of town I felt very welcomed."}
{"text":"Sushi in Madison can be pretty dicey.  So far, the only places that I've found worth eating at on a regular basis are Sushi Muramoto and this place...  If you want sushi variety this is the place to go... Lots of funky, innovative rolls, though the simple stuff is solid too.  The quality/freshness is better than anything you will find in this area (next to Muramoto)... I've had some of the best Uni I've ever had at Red Sushi (which is my ultimate sushi restaurant test, since when it's off, it can be horrific!)

Definitely worth checking out, prices are fair--lunch specials are a great deal as well."}
{"text":"Went just as they were opening for the evening so was seated right away, and chose to sit outside. Normal outdoor seating furniture for Madison. Our waitress was very nice and provided great service. 

The fish was very fresh and they had an interesting selection of regular and specialty rolls. However, I thought the chef selection option was below par for the price especially compared to Muramoto The selection of Saki was also very impressive and our waitress had excellent knowledge of the different kinds and was able to explain to us what she thought we would enjoy.

All in all a good experience, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I had a great experience this week at Red Sushi.

On accommodations...
Each time that I have dined at Red, the cozy and clean space has been filled with patrons.  Although my experiences have been limited to week nights (I serve at a local restaurant on weekends) I am always pleased and surprised by how accommodating they are.  I have never had to wait long for a table or felt that my server had too many tables to provide an enjoyable experience.

On food...
In my opinion, Red Sushi is the best sushi in Madison.  On Wednesday I enjoyed the Surf'n'Turf roll with crab and (I apologize for not remembering the menu item name) but a signature roll with pickled jalopenos and finished with strawberries.  Both rolls served and exceeded my expectations - killer combinations!

On service...
Attentive. Kind. Helpful. Happy. 

Thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. We're from Madison area and enjoy sushi. This was our first time here and we will make this our future date night favorite! 
Candy Apple roll was to die for. We also ordered sushi & sashimi chefs choice. Miso soup was the best I've ever had. 

The restaurant is small and there is not a real waiting area. Crowded by the door because of those who order takeout. We put our name in close to 6 on a Friday night, they said they'd text us in an hour. 30 minutes later we got the text, walked back and had a seat at the bar. 

Worth the wait and worth every penny. 
Waitstaff was kind and although insanely busy we never felt like they were too busy to answer any questions. 

So good."}
{"text":"Your tastebuds are about to take a pleasurable trip in the form of endless sushi rolls when you dine at Red Sushi.  

The menu offers a variety of classic sushi rolls, but also offers modern twists to signature rolls for those who crave an slightly more adventurous route. My personal favorite is the mermaid roll, which intertwines the spicy flavors of jalapeño and tuna with the smooth tones of the mango, strawberry and kiwi sauce. If you want to expand beyond the realm of sushi, theres a plethora of equally appetizing options such as tempuras or grilled entrees. 

The service left me with no complaints and the atmosphere has a modernly cool vibe. Only word of warning is to be prepared to wait for your table; no reservations allowed at this joint. However, the wait is most definitely worth the caliber of cuisine served."}
{"text":"this place was great! In fact, it was the only restaurant in Madison that I liked and the only restaurant that didn't disappoint. Fish was really fresh. Even my husband who isn't a sushi fan enjoyed it here. Since I was 7 weeks pregnant at the time of my visit I can't tell you if the raw sushi was good but my husband's colleague from San Francisco said that it is very comparable to the ones in San Francisco (which is a good thing). Service was great. Tiny place so better make reservations."}
{"text":"Stopped by Red for dinner last week and I can say, I can't wait for another trip.   I enjoyed a Bagel Roll, Surf n Turf, and a Grouper Roll.  As well as the Shumai as an app.

Our order arrived very quickly.  The sushi was fresh and tasty.  The service was friendly and prompt.  

The atmosphere was modern, but warm.  The bar is fairly long if you enjoy being up front, otherwise there is table and patio seating.

My favorite part, was the bill.  Splitting three rolls, an app, a beer and a martini, the bill was only $50.  Very affordable considering the quality and location.

If you like Muramoto in Hilldale, give this a shot.  It's just as good, at a much more affordable rate."}
{"text":"hands down best sushi in town. have never been disappointed.  the rolls are creative and unique and there are a ton of options not only for raw fish lovers but for cooked lovers.

try the omega 3 and 6 rolls and the peking roll.

shumai are awesome"}
{"text":"Had dinner here while passing through Madison, the Maui roll was delicious! Loved it! The rainbow roll was equally as good! I felt the prices were a little high, but apart from that I would highly recommend! The decor was cool too, music was a lil hmmmmm? But it was Saturday night and they were busy, So maybe the staff needed the pep the dance music provides!"}
{"text":"Jumping on the 1st Yelp review bandwagon for this place.  Went here for lunch last weekend, and had a great meal.  The place still looks the same as I remember it to be almost 4 years ago when it was the only Muramoto's in town, but it seems a little brighter.  Service was prompt, friendly, and helpful.  Sushi was kind of amazing.  Some of the best quality we've found in Madison.  This is definitely \"fancy\" sushi- if you want the plain Jane Japanese, go to Takara (which we also like very much).  But if you want some great quality sushi and don't mind paying for it, go here.  I'd rather here than driving out to Muramoto's in Hilldale any day.  Would have given 5 stars- my only criticism was that the sushi took what I felt was a long time to come out (there were only 2 other couples in there when we ordered).  We're looking forward to trying this place for dinner!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the delicious sushi and amazing waiter. I wish I had caught his name because he deserves rexognition for his oitstanding service. Everything we ate was to die for. I especially loved their option for black rice! I just wish the restaurant were larger! Definitely going back to try more rolls."}
{"text":"Very consistent. Best sushi we have had since we lived in S Florida. Very fresh, although some rolls can have too much going on"}
{"text":"Best sushi in all of Madison!!! Owner is friendly and quality of fish is 5 star! Attention to detail in garnishes and plate presentation is exquisite!"}
{"text":"We are relocated Californians who have been missing our sushi. This rivals some of our favorite LA spots. The salmon and the uni were extra special. We had to take out but even that was a great experience - a very convenient online ordering system and great customer service. We'll be back and next time hope to enjoy the great ambience!"}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good but the service is really awful.  This is specifically for ordering for pick-up, which we've done twice now with a terrible experience.  The first time we ordered around 20 minutes ahead of time and they told us it would be ready in 30 minutes.  We got there 10 minutes early and they said it wasn't ready, which was fine because we were early.  It then took them another 60 minutes before our order was ready.  During the wait, they never once updated us on the status and when we asked they just told us, \"They're working on it.\"  They never offered us an apology for the wait, didn't give us a discount or anything for waiting for so long, and didn't do anything to make the wait better.  It was a miserable experience and we thought, \"Well, maybe it's because they're just having a busy and off night.\" so we tried again.

This time we placed an order more than an hour ahead of time and specifically gave them a time of pickup.  We showed up and it wasn't ready, so we waited.  15 minutes later, still no updates and I was fed up and asked what was going on and whether they could give us an ETA.  Again, no apology, just a, \"They're working on it\" and then a few minutes later they finally came out with it.

While the quality of the food is okay, it doesn't make up for the high prices and crappy service.  Two tries was enough and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this restaurant! I am vegetarian and I loved the fact that they had so many vegan and vegetarian options. The vegan rainbow roll is amazing and is plated beautifully. The restaurant also offers soy paper and rice paper instead of seaweed. I went with a friend who was new to sushi and the server walked her through the menu and helped her pick out a perfect roll."}
{"text":"I am going to preface this review by saying that I am a vegetarian, so I can't speak to the quality of the fish.

However, I can say that the vegetarian rolls were very good and pleasantly inventive.  I particularly enjoyed the uniqueness of the tempura green bean roll.  For vegans, there is also a vegan roll which has a lot of engaging textures.  The rolls were attractively served.

For the vegetarian rolls, the price was reasonable.  

I found the interior to be very engaging and high energy.  It was the perfect stop on a night out before hitting a comedy at the Bartell Theater.  

Please note that the seating is very much like the Icon.  You are seated VERY close to your neighbor.  If you are looking for a quiet, personal evening, then this is not the place for you.  Seating for a group would be a challenge, but they do accept reservations for parties greater than four.

Our waitress was absolutely fantastic.  I cannot say enough good things about the enthusiasm that she brought to our evening.  And, here roll suggestions were helpful and much appreciated.  However, the service in general can start to cross the line into overbearing.  The hostess and two other waitresses were on hand to immediately fill glasses and take care of the checks.  

As another reviewer noted, and this is by no means a reason not to try Red, the soy sauce is very salty.  

Red does not accept Discover cards."}
{"text":"Really order from the waitress when I am sitting at the bar, who forgets my sake order then 20 minutes later offers me a small on the house when I ordered a whole bottle earlier (really cheap and not her money lol) The rolls are garbage, the sushi is pretty good, but Jack Red Snapper is not Yellow Tail and your the owner.
If you want over priced sushi and a trendy crowd that wouldn't know good sushi if you hit them on the head with a fresh fish then go to Red Sushi, I would rather be dead than good to Red. ( See what I did there)."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've ever had. The dumplings are fantastic, the rolls are fresh and beautiful. They have a nice balance of traditional rolls and new fusion rolls to experience. The service is great, I just wish they accepted reservations. The wait can be really long."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! A little pricey yes BUT incredibly fresh ingredients and amazing quality of food. HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in Madison! I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad roll. A good trick is to come at lunch, the menu is still phenomenal and a little cheaper. but even for dinner, its always worth the wait and the price. Love this place, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Their menu had so many amazing options I was slightly overwhelmed. Wanted to try one of everything!! The place is small and packed on the weekends - so make a reservation, but you can only do so if you have 4 or more in your party."}
{"text":"I am colorblind so to me I call the restaurant Grey but I am still a fan fresh fish fresh catch and fresh sushi"}
{"text":"Small but great atmosphere. Food is terrific. We went on a busy Saturday night (May 2015) and got right in, but you have to go early (we saw a lot of people turned away because it can get very busy). 

Even with a packed crowd in a smallish space, our food was served up pretty quickly and with expert presentation. The server/bartender Robert (serving the sushi bar where we sat) was amazing. That guy handled a million things at once, and never flinched. 

Overall a great downtown Madison option for any night! The bagel roll is lights out :)"}
{"text":"My first Yelp review! This place definitely deserves one though. The food was amazing, the service was excellent and the decor is simple and \"classy\". I normally get 3 rolls when I got to a place like Takara so I ordered three here and was unable to finish. They definitely do not skimp on the portions and the price is very reasonable. I will return to this restaurant for all of my future Madison sushi endeavors!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the presentation and size of the rolls the first time we ate here.  Went for another round this week and order different rolls.  Everything was yummy!  This will be our regular sushi go to for awhile!"}
{"text":"8 of my friends and I drove from Milwaukee and went to Red this past Saturday night, and had a great time!  We went super early, at 4:30, and it was pretty quiet.  But by the time we left around 6pm it was very busy.  Our server was Ryan, and he was incredibly attentive.  He had great recommendations which was helpful too.  I was on the fence about a cocktail and just told him \"I don't like sweet things and sake, but I love whiskey\" and he recommended a DELICIOUS drink (it was served with a blackberry...can't remember the name).  I ordered miso soup and the tsunami roll and they were both really tasty.  I liked that they discretely cut the rolls into manageable pieces, too!  Ryan was helpful and available and efficient in getting us all of our drink and requests.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall great meal and experience. Atmosphere is hip and upbeat. 

-Hot tea is mild but delicious!
-Appetizer: oysters, delicious! Could have kept eating them all night, but pricy.
-Main course: tempura shrimp roll, plain, simple, and clean. Perfection!     Super Volcano: hard to eat with chop sticks, heat was inconsistent, so some bites were spicy and some weren't.
- Prices were affordable, other than oysters

I would defiantly go back, no questions asked!"}
{"text":"Ate here based on a recommendation from my AirBnB host the night I hit town after driving in from the East Coast for 2 days. I'm a big sushi fan and was really impressed by this place. I love yellowtail, so I had the regular yellowtail roll and the Amigo, which were great. Also did the Omega 3 and an Unagi. Had a signature cocktail to start things off, one of their gin options, and it was excellent. The service was attentive, very nice atmosphere...I'm looking forward to going back and making it my regular spot for sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison. Creative, high-quality options and always welcoming. Jimmy is a great server, attentive and personable."}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place we try to get together once or twice a month for lady's night before heading to Madison bar down the street.This place never disappointed me. Best sushi place bye far in Madison."}
{"text":"Weekenders beware. I went to Sushi Red on Saturday night at 6 pm for my friend's birthday. We were a party of 8 and Red is very small, so we were anticipating a wait. We were told the wait would be 2 hours and we agreed to this because my friend really, really wanted to eat here for her birthday. By 8 45 pm we still were waiting to be seated. We asked the host of we would be able to sit soon and her response was, \"yeah, that's probably not going to happen tonight.\" I understand that our party of 8 is difficult to accommodate in such a small space, but they should have told us at 6 that we couldn't get in instead of letting us wait over 2 and a half hours. We were all very hungry at that point. We insisted that they find a spot for us since we waited so long and my friend wanted this restaurant so badly on her birthday. They finally found a spot for us at 9 10 pm. They close at 10 pm and they rushed us through our entire meal. They attempted to take plates and drinks before we were finished with them and you could tell they wanted to get us out of there so they could close. The whole situation was very rude. I have no complaints about their food, everything tasted excellent, but customer service is severely lacking. If you are a party of 2 and you go on a Monday or Tuesday in sure you'll have a great experience, but I would recommend staying away on Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Just okay sushi. The cold sake I selected tasted like it was laced with vodka (too strong, not enough sake flavor) and all of their cold sakes are served in small portion bottles--tres cheesy. Their web site makes it look classier than it is, which is a little hole in the wall off of King ST in downtown Madison. If you want real sushi in Madison, try Takara."}
{"text":"I really think this is the best sushi in Madison and I've tried a lot!  Fast, fresh, different.  We've tried the rain, King triton, spicy tuna, and salmon rolls.  All out of this world delicious!"}
{"text":"I ate at the sushi bar tonight with a couple of friends.

Seaweed salad and Reisling were okay - as-expected.

The shellfish trio was delish. The cold crawfish and sea scallop on top made it the perfect bite with the shrimp tempura.

The firecracker was tasty - it wasn't spicy as I had expected. Nonetheless, ate every bite.

Our server was great and helpful with suggestions. 

We all had a great time and I'm looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. It's my favorite sushi  in Madison hands down. The bagel roll is to die for. Also, the roll with mango and salmon in it (cant remember the name, perhaps tropical)  is my other favorite. Great service, nice environment. 

My only complaint? I wish they would deliver or at the very least be connected with Straight to Your Door (S2YD)."}
{"text":"It was an experience here. I've had better sushi elsewhere, but my wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere.  That's the reason we'll come back. It was \"young and hip\", I just wish it was more delectable."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my birthday with a few friends.  It was a Wednesday so we got seating right away, and the parking situation ain't that bad either if you're on a bike thanks to the new racks out in front.

Urban, modern decor, black/red themed seats and china, great warm ambiance. We ordered some bubbly to start off, which oddly came only in the smaller bottles but nothing to bitch about.  The menu is quite impressive, with a wide sake and cocktail selection.  Ordered a good, relatively inexpensive dry sake which was ample for two or three people.

Impressive selection of rolls.  We ordered a good number of them -- I'd say my favorite were the Red and the Lobster Tempura.  The former is a spicy tuna roll topped with yet more tuna and red tobiko -- absolutely velvet on the tongue. The latter brought together the succulentness (succulentity? this word needs a noun form) of lobster with the crispiness of tempura really well, and it was a bigger roll that didn't just fall apart once it hits your mouth.  The rest of the rolls we had shone as well -- the more traditional rolls done very well.

Excellent place, new favorite sushi restaurant in Madison. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal. Did the lunch special and added a seaweed salad. With a generous tip, it came to below $30, and I was stuffed. Took a friend who had never been before, and she absolutely loved it. It's definitely a place to take newbies because of the consistently high quality and outstanding service. Love you Red!!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've had in Madison! Both the Mermaid roll (special) and Vegetable Tempura roll were excellent."}
{"text":"By FAR, the best sushi in town! I have not gotten one roll I didn't like and have many rolls that I crave. Their Super Volcano is my go-to roll and Tsunami is another more recent favorite of mine. They have something for everyone, cooked sushi, raw, sashimi, and other food. And their miso soup is the best I've had...ever! I cannot say enough good things about this place except that everyone that I've referred has made it their new sushi place. I've referred so many people I feel as if I deserve a commission :) Plus if you work downtown, they have a fabulous lunch deal with great rolls to choose from."}
{"text":"I loved the food here. It's a pretty small restaurant so you may have to wait on a busy night.
My boyfriend and I shared tuna tataki and 3 rolls and were both stuffed by the end. They had specials on a roll that saved us $4 and was delicious.

Great sushi at a fair price."}
{"text":"Abysmal.  Horrible service and mediocre at best sushi.  

to be fair the toro and escolar sushi were both pretty good...actually some of the best I've had in Madison (which doesn't say much).  being fortunate enough to have really great omakase sushi experiences before, this sushi is for people who don't know sushi.

Now let me get to the crux of the matter, the horrid service.  While all of the female staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, the dude taking our order behind the sushi bar was horrible.  Strangely we didn't order from the sushi chef, which is what one comes to expect when they belly up to a sushi bar.  Instead we were served by some guy who clearly didn't want to be there.  When he asked how our half eaten uni sushi order was, we told him it was chemical tasting (which is was, there is no confusing that taste).  He struck up a defensive tone and told us that no one else had ever complained about their uni before......ummmmmmmmm, what? Guess what buddy, someone just did and that ain't the way to handle it.  And then that was all he said, no I'm sorry to hear that, no did you want to try something else, it was all attitude.  Maybe that flies with the college age crowd downing sake bombs and slathering their sushi with cream cheese all to the backdrop of thumping club music but legit service or sushi restaurant this does not make.

I'm done with this place, I'll stick with Takumi out on the eastside for my next perfectly acceptable but mediocore midwestern sushi fix. Even Whole Foods or Willy St Coop has better sushi than Red.

Disclaimer: I have eaten great sushi all over Japan, NYC, SF, Miami, Chicago, etc. I have also had bad, spit it out in your napkin or spend all night in the bathroom sushi.  This ranks somewhere in between."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The sushi is consistently good. Last night we ordered the Atlantis roll which included tuna, mango and jalapeños. It had a hint of anise that I couldn't quite place. We also ordered the Alaskan roll with salmon.  This was probably my favorite of the night because it was light and fresh. Finally we ordered the crunchy tuna.

The lychee Martini is really my favorite thing on the menu. It is sweet and a perfect summer drink.  It is not that boozy."}
{"text":"Loved it. Hands down best sushi I've ever had.  We started with the gyoza which was very good. Then we ordered two specialty rolls and one of the nightly special rolls. I cant even remember what they were called!  They were delicious and huge. Normally my husband thinks sushi isn't that filling but not this time. We had a lot of leftovers.  It did get crowded pretty quick but we went around 5pm on a weekday so we got a table right away. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We just left and let me tell you, atmosphere was not good. Mainly caused by other patrons; in particular a group of women who were extremely loud and one who cackles.  We moved to the back of the restaurant to escape but the sound carried...  Food was above average, so we'll give it another try. Surf n turf roll was a little salty. I hope the ladies stick to joints were you might bring a colicky baby -- those with inherent background noise."}
{"text":"We specifically chose this restaurant based on its strong Yelp reviews and we were very much looking forward to a great dinner. We only had two nights in Madison and had carefully chosen our restaurants for each night. 

We arrived and were seated promptly which we were happy about. We ordered our whole meal, which consisted of drinks, appetizers and a few basic sushi rolls within the first 10 minutes after being seated at 8:30, and received our appetizer of Brussels sprout salad (which was delicious) within a reasonable amount of time. Drinks arrived when we had finished our appetizer - still can't figure out why a glass of wine and a beer took almost 20 minutes to arrive.

At 9:10, we had to track down our server to inquire about our sushi rolls and she said she had just checked with the kitchen and our food would be out soon. The point I want to make clear is that all we needed was some communication about what happened between the time we placed our order (8:30) and the present. We were hadn't heard from her in far too long.  We ordered very basic rolls: two California rolls, a spicy tuna roll, a chicken tempura roll and two shrimp tempura rolls: nothing out of the ordinary. But when the server finally came over with our food, after no check-ins with us to see if we needed anything else within the HOUR it took to get our sushi, we were already pretty upset. The server must have realized this might happen b/c she came over with the manager, who was apologetic and said she would speak with the kitchen to figure out what went wrong with our order. Our server never offered so much as an apology. We had to seek her out to ask for a check by 9:50 and subsequently had to seek her out to pay the bill. 

Perhaps the most disappointing and stunning aspect was the fact that NOTHING was removed from the bill and no further acknowledgement of the hour long delay was made. It made the apology ring very hollow.

I have never, in all of my years being a reader of Yelp felt disturbed enough by a dining experience that I was compelled to write a negative review, but after my family's experience tonight at Red, I felt that I had to share my experience with fellow readers."}
{"text":"Don't skip the appetizers--beef carpaccio and roasted fennel soup with lobster were outstanding. We tried four different cocktails and they were all superb. Pick one to your taste. Rolls were creative. The spicy tuna was much fresher than most places. Chu-toro sushi and sashimi was superb. They ran out of oysters just as we ordered. We sat outdoors, where the table was a bit small for four, but the atmosphere was lovely (back patio). Hostess and waitresses were friendly, bus staff was efficient. Bartender gave us drinks filled to the brim. If I were local, I would repeat!"}
{"text":"Sushi Red is a great atmosphere with great service. Excellent sushi, clean restaurant.  Tried the super volcano and another specialty roll. Good portions  $9 to $16 for specialty rolls but worth it."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best sushi I have had in the Midwest. I went here as a party of five with reservation scheduled ahead. We were seated right away. Our server was prompt and attentive. Our drinks and apps came quickly, as did our rolls. I could not believe the flavor packed into these small (and sometimes large) bites. Absolutely astounding. I have never cared for sushi to this level, and this eatery made my month. From start to finish, service was flawless. Such a great atmosphere. I cannot wait to visit here weekly."}
{"text":"The tempura cream cheese stuffed jalapeños were awesome! The sushi was excellent ( especially the tempira lobster roll and the Godzilla roll) The dessert was to die for (hazelnut chocolate mousse). And our server was exceptional!  I highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I make it a point to seek out the very best sushi, and the very best environment for eating said delight. I don't intend to sound like a douche, but I've had really shitty sushi and I want to find the good stuff. Red is the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to, and I've been to around 60 different sushi places. Located just off the central Capitol area in Madison, Red is admittedly a pretty hip place to get sushi. It was a Friday night, but we were seated around 7 after only a half hour wait. Definitely something I can handle at a popular place in a food-friendly city. Usually I get annoyed with overly 'cool' places like this, but everything you look for in a restaurant was truly five-star quality. The atmosphere was just loud enough to give a good vibe while eating, but not too much that I couldn't hear us talking. The lighting provided a very relaxed yet buzzing ambiance as well. My girl and I shared a few rolls, but the one that stands out is the Surf and Turf. This roll featured king crab in the middle mixed with avocado, topped with seared filet mignon and Red's homemade steak sauce. Yes, there was steak on top of this sushi. They pulled it off so well; everything was tender and flavorful, and none of the flavors masked or overpowered any of the others. Another standout was the Orange Crunch, a shrimp tempura/salmon roll topped with a fantastic spicy aioli. I can't recall the drinks we had but they were great as well. Speaking of the drinks, I'd like to point out the consideration and overall coolness of the waitress. Can't remember her name, but my drivers license had expired the day we went here, and I really wanted a drink. I wasn't being particularly pushy on it, as I understood that legally a waiter or waitress is required to turn a drinking patron away if their license is expired. However, she saw that it had just expired the day of and mentioned it to management. They gave her the okay to serve me after she told the manager how nice my girlfriend and I were! So awesome. I rarely get a waitress this cool, and as someone who believes in waiters/waitresses earning their tips rather than being entitled to them, I can say she definitely earned hers. The total was very modest, for three rolls and two drinks. I believe it was around 60, which is what I've come to expect with good sushi places. 

Overall, if you're really into sushi and you're looking for innovative, fresh rolls with super attentive and courteous service, go to Red. It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love Red. The rolls are amazing and offer everything from traditional Sake sashimi to modern Spicy Godzilla Rolls. I've traveled around the world and have never had better sushi. Yes the sushi is the best I've ever had, but don't forget their drink menu. For years now craft cocktails have become more and more popular in madison but Red always upstages the rest. Try the lychee martini, and the ginger sour, you won't regret it. Oh, and the seaweed salad is a must!

The only bad part about Red is how small it is which in turn always means a long wait time. If you have a party of 4 or more make a reservation a couple of days in advance. Or if it's just a few people go early. Put in your name and if it's long grab a coffee or beer just up the block at collectivo. 

Hopefully Red will expand if ever possible or move. I really do love this place and no mater what kind of sushi you like in sure you'll find something. Just be aware of the hostess and her damn wait times (but it's totally worth the wait!)"}
{"text":"Update to below:
Our fifth visit to Red, first time not on a weekend - and they confused our order - asked for spicy yellowtail - and got regular yellowtail. When we questioned it, our server talked with the sushi chef, and they prepared another roll, but with a different fish altogether that was not as pleasant as yellowtail with a side of spicy sauce, no sauce in the roll. Really disappointing, based on how much better our other visits had been. 
 
By far the best, freshest sushi in town. Wide variety of fish and Japanese entrees. Even my parents (one not a sushi-eater) enjoyed dinner. Wait staff is hit or miss.  Small space, can be loud, but still our go-to for sushi in Madison"}
{"text":"Outstanding. I was here for lunch a few days back with coworkers and customers. GREAT experience. GREAT options and the lunch options are better than any place I've been to in Madison. The Sushi was simply amazing, the freshest, tastiest I've had pretty much anywhere. Service was GREAT, they were on top of things and very friendly. The place was packed, but it didn't feel that way. It never felt like I was jammed in and elbowing the party next to me, and it never got too loud to have a conversation. HUGE plus for me. 

Go here. Definitely a bright spot in Madison for food."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places in Madison. The staff are friendly. Only problem is they won't take a reservation for two and there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"Red's new location is great. So is their food and drinks. But the service is not quite there. It took an extra hour to seat us on a Saturday, and about 20 minutes to get a menu, and another 10 to get the bottle of sake we ordered.
When the items we ordered came, they were excellent. Unfortunately, I was so hungry by that time, I can't recall what exactly I ordered.

#1 suggestion: for a place that wants to be a restaurant + LOUNGE... turn down the lights!!!
It's so. bright. inside."}
{"text":"Ambiance is a sure 10. Hostess was friendly enough. It was pretty busy with an hour wait so we took a spot that opened up at the bar. Service was great at the bar. Very enthusiastic and helpful. We ordered 3 rolls. The presentation was nice although the Purple one was something to be desired. I have spent the last 10 years in large cities with great sushi .  I was disappointed by the  large size of the rolls and lack of tightness. They fell apart and gagged me because of their size.  We only ate a portion of what was served. Also do to these oversized rolls I really didn't get a chance to enjoy the flavor if any. 
I would not order sushi here again unless they learn how to roll but for a drink and try something else of the menu , absolutely."}
{"text":"Red was a trendy modern looking restaurant. The staff was super friendly, however the sushi left a little to be desired. They had a good lunch special price wise. The quality of the sushi was nothing exceptional, not bad, just not great. I don't know that I would come back. The restaurant had just moved locations, so I'm not sure of that was the problem. I would say it was just an average sushi experience."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison and luckily stumbled in here, great service, FRESH products - sat at the Sushi bar and was impressed with each roll that was created in front of my eyes."}
{"text":"Red was damn near perfect. Ryan was an excellent server. We connected with him really really well, his attitude and vibe made us want to order more. The music sucked, but otherwise literally every aspect of our dining experience was divine. The sushi was clean and delicious, made you feel like a milli"}
{"text":"My husband saw the Campus Eats show (on the Big 10 Network) last night that showcased Red. We decided to finally head that way for his birthday dinner, tonight. It is a restaurant we've wanted to go to, but just hadn't made it there yet. Walking in to the restaurant we were impressed with the elegant, yet modern vibe that drew you in, in a fun, welcoming way.

While waiting for a table at the bar, I started out with the Ciao Amigo cocktail, which was delightfully tangy and delicious. 

Once seated, Ryan, our server, came to guide us through the menu. All of our rolls were great, but our favorite was the Crunchy Tuna Roll. The Saigon roll was riceless and delicious, too. Not having had a riceless roll before, we weren't sure what to expect. It did not disappoint.

We also had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, Tanya. What a fun and delectable experience. We will be back, soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, food, and drinks. I would highly recommend the seaweed salad as a starter. They have an excellent lunch menu with very reasonable prices. The staff is always friendly, and the food is well worth the wait. Whenever I am craving sushi, this is where I go."}
{"text":"We expected a lot better for the money. Edamame was uninspired, asparagus rolls tasted off, other rolls containing raw fish were pretty meh. We ordered online for pickup and it wasn't ready when we arrived or very good when we got back to our hotel."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Madison, WI! This is coming from someone who lived on the coast for a couple of years. My boyfriend and I have become frequent guests, usually going about once a week. We always get the sashimi dinner and a couple of rolls. The sashimi dinner always offers up at least 20 pieces of melt in your mouth fresh fish! Just the way I like it. As far as rolls go, I can't pick a favorite. They are all so good we try to try at least one new roll every time we go!"}
{"text":"RED on King Street was definitely a 5 star experience. RED at it's new location on West Washington is a 4 star experience. The food is still phenomenal and I still consider it the best sushi in Madison but it lost its charm! I miss the \"old\" RED. 

When we go we almost always get the sashimi dinner and a couple of rolls! The sashimi dinner is a good deal considering the amount of fish you get for the price! All of their specialty rolls are divine and unique. You wouldn't think some of the items go together very well but they do! I am not a fan of the rolls with red meat on them but other than that I've never tried something I didn't like at RED. If you never visited the \"old\" RED you won't even know what your missing and I would totally recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for sushi in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Excellent very fresh sushi! Great crowd and worth the little wait. I am visiting from Los Angeles and this restaurant is as good as many in LA, NYC & SFO"}
{"text":"We love to sit at the sushi bar.   Cool atmosphere and great service.     Be sure to try the Orange Crunch Roll."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great service and DELICIOUS sushi. My husband and I shared 4 rolls and were blown away by all of them. We are big fans of the classic spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls so we got one of each. These were WAY better than any I've ever had. No gloopy mayo to account for the \"spicy,\" just super fresh, beautiful fish and tons of avocado. We had a tsunami roll and a triple decker roll. Lots of flavor going on in both and also delicious. We enjoyed every bite and the great vibe the restaurant provided as well. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. ...Simply amazing food and great atmosphere....My wife and I went for dinner we got 3 rolls 2 bowls of miso soup and a amazing teriyaki steak dinner and topped it off with chocolate mousse desert and we loved every bite. This is are new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful sushi! 

Went for girls night to try a new place in Madison. The service was wonderful. We had a great spot right at the bar and the waiter was very attentive and personable. The sushi was also delicious. We both had the Crunchy Tuna specialty roll along with some of the traditional rolls. The seafood was fresh and delicious. Also reasonably priced.  Would definitely recommend this and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Vegan sushi for the win!

I stopped in at Red when I was in Madison for business. It was noon on a Friday and the place was packed, but I was seated promptly and my server showed up at my table soon after. My server was attentive and knowledgeable.  The restaurant's vibe is casual and trendy.

I ordered the lunch sushi special, which is two rolls for $15. I ordered the vegan sushi roll and the vegan spider roll. It was beautiful and tasted absolutely amazing! Now I'm going to be dreaming about the sushi at Red because it was absolutely incredible! I obviously can't speak to the fish-based sushi (is that even a real term??), but if it is as fresh and tasty as the vegan rolls, then you're in for a treat.

The bill for two sushi rolls, tea, and tip was $24. That's high compared to Milwaukee area restaurants, but 1) I can't complain because the food was amazing, and 2) I am not in Madison enough to say whether that's average for the area."}
{"text":"This place was so good. I had been craving sushi for a long time now and Red hit the spot. The new space is large and welcoming and pro-tip: they take reservations now! They also have a nice outdoor space overlooking W. Washington and the Capital. They've carried over their previous menu with a few new additions. 
We started with drinks- the Ginger Sour and some drink that started with a 'p' that I can't recall. The Ginger Sour was delicious with a nice layer of egg white foam on top. The other drink tasted like oranges. I was very surprised to find out it was a gin drink as I typically can't stand gin. 
We ordered the brussel sprout gyoza as an appetizer. Do yourself a favor and order this when you go. I am not on the brussel sprout train (never have enjoyed them), but this was AMAZING. The 7 spice and bacon really add to the flavor of the dumpling. 
For our main meal, my friend and I split 4 rolls- Dragon, Orange Crunch, Firework and Triple Decker. I was wary of the Dragon Roll as I hadn't had eel before but holy crow was it tasty. Slightly sweet, not overpowering in flavor. It ended up being my favorite. 
My husband got the Ramen and Philly Roll. He said the Ramen was spicy, but not overly so. It made great leftovers as well!

We left full, but not stuffed. If you've been to Red before, I highly recommend checking out the new space and if you haven't, go see what the fuss is all about!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not worth a super Yelp rave.  Popped into this place on Saturday of the Fourth of July weekend around 8 PM.  It was busy but they did manage to get us a table.  Very extensive menu of rolls, some fairly creative.  The sake menu is basically a few pages off a color printer.  Reasonable priced.  It was a nice, middle of the road sushi dinner -- didn't blow me away but did not suck."}
{"text":"RED is a great place to get sushi in Madison. I've been here twice in the past month. Most recently I got the Dynamite roll and the Spicy Godzilla roll, both of which were incredibly delicious and filling. I also got these rolls during the lunch special which is two rolls for $13.50, an amazing deal. I also find the restaurant to be incredibly beautiful. Our server was very nice, but overall the service is quite average. I would highly recommend this place for any sushi lover."}
{"text":"The food was good, once we finally got it. Some of the worst service by the waitstaff ever experienced.  Sushi was order by 2 and steaks by the other 2. Steaks were brought and eaten before any sushi made it to the table.

Server never came by to ask if we needed anything, we had to flag him down, had to ask another server to check on our drink order.on and on.  

Food was good but when served so slowly and so poorly it detracts from the entire experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi in Wisconsin? 

Yes !! Service was excellent as well and will be back."}
{"text":"It was my girlfriend and I's anniversary and we wanted to try something new. We were pleasantly surprised with the classy and clean decor inside. Our server Dorothy was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. They had some classic sushi rolls and some creative ones we have never tried or seen before. For our appetizer we tried the negimaki which had a twist compared to the original scallions wraps in thin slices of meat. They also added asparagus, which gave it a great flavor and crunch. We also had the Salmon bruschetta (this was one of my favorites) and the gozilla roll. For our entree, we shared the shrimp and scallops dish. It was great! The veggies are seasoned perfect and the shrimp and scallops were cooked perfect too.

We definitely want to go back and try a lot of the other dishes. They have a lot of innovative and new dishes we have never tried or seen in any other sushi menu."}
{"text":"Such a great sushi spot in Madison! Having lived in California my entire life, I was a bit skeptical about sushi in the Midwest but I can confidently say that the experience at RED is just as good as any you'd have on the West Coast. 

I usually get some sort of chef's choice sushi/sashimi because I like having a range options and I have never been disappointed by the selection of fish offered to me. Their sushi is fresh, delicious, and beautifully plated. They have a decent selection of beer, sake, cocktails and my favorite is the lychee martini. It is delightfully sweet but not overpoweringly so and comes with a whole piece of juicy lychee, which is a nice touch. The service here is attentive - you'll probably rarely ever have your water glass empty -- and the decor is hip and tasteful. The prices are pretty fair too for what you get. Their lunch special is an especially good deal, considering that sushi is also more filling than I expect it to be. RED is my go-to choice for sushi in Madison and I look forward to many delicious meals to come."}
{"text":"Meh.  That's how I felt when leaving Red.  Nothing really stood out to me as extremely good or extremely bad.

There is no doubt that you are 100% paying for the location and atmosphere here.  While the interior is beautiful and modern, I felt the sushi, while good, was overpriced.  I can get similar quality sushi at other places for a lower price.

Our service was fine.  It was more attentive at the beginning of the meal than it was toward the end.  Our server didn't really engage with us, which was fine, too, I guess.

Probably the worst thing about it is that I left still hungry.  Call me crazy, but if I drop $60 for dinner, I expect to, at the very least, not feel like I need to stop somewhere else to eat in order to have my hunger feel satisfied.

What I liked most about my experience (besides looking at the capital building from our outside table), was that we ordered tobiko on top of our sushi and it was multicolored and so beautiful!  The overall presentation of the sushi rolls was lovely, as well.

I'd probably come back only if someone insisted on coming here, but it won't be my top choice for sushi in Madison."}
{"text":"Everyone must have gotten the \"this-place-gets-packed\" memo because there was a 20+ minute wait at 5:45pm on a Friday.  Wowzers!  The downside is that the place is tiny - there's not really much room to wait in the restaurant or a bar to sit at.  The hostess asked for our phone number and politely advised that she would \"call when a table is ready\" which made me feel like we needed to leave and entertain ourselves for a spell.  The problem is the 20-25 minute wait isn't quite long enough to go somewhere else, get a beer, drink it, wondering when you're going to get a call and feel like you have to chug it down to get back there asap (since it's not like you're in the same place and can simply carry it back to your table).  Reservations are only accepted for groups of four or more and our waitress advised calling at least a day in advance. 

Onward and upward.  The menu included several vegetarian rolls, which I appreciated. The prices were average for sushi in the area, if not a wee bit higher. This is the first restaurant I've found around with shitake rolls on the menu (my favorite) so I was thrilled!  Unfortunately (like many of their veg rolls here) it was to be served in tempura batter.  Noo!  Don't drown the shitake!!  Fortunately, I asked the waitress for a simple, basic, plain ol' shitake roll (minus the tempura) and the chef obliged.  The first order got messed up (dipped in tempura batter anyways) but our waitress noticed and brought a plain shitake roll next.  This was great because we got to compare - and the plain one was great, you really got to taste the shitake, in the tempura roll it was also rolled with avocado which, along with the batter, essentially overpowered the mushroom.  Plain is the way to go and I appreciated the accommodating service! 

BOTTOM LINE: Charming service and good shitake rolls means I'll go back - I'll just try to get there even earlier!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and had the vegan roll and the avocado roll with the six grain rice--both were amazing. I love that they offer a healthier rice option, and their vegan rolls are hearty! Best avocado roll I've ever had. Really awesome atmosphere too, I love the decor and vibe. Fairly priced for the quality of the food. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"There isn't enough I can say about Red. It is hands down the best sushi in Madison--nothing even comes close, and I have seriously tried them all. The Salmon Lover roll is life changing, and the Volcano roll is phenomenal. Really everything on the menu--including non-sushi items like the teriyaki chicken and various appetizers--is fantastic. Definitely try their seasonal rolls and dishes. This is our go-to date night, girls night, you name it for a great meal.

All sushi restaurants are expensive, and Red's prices are competitive at a much (much!) higher quality than anywhere else in the city. While special rolls run about $14-16, you can also easily get a more basic roll for $5-6. They have a full bar with everything from basic beers ($4-6) to house craft cocktails ($8-10) to wine and a huge sake selection.

This place is always pretty packed during weekends and dinner time, but they do offer takeout, and have recently updated their reservation system using a wait list app, and there are no shortage of nearby places to grab a drink if you need to wait awhile for a table. At the time of posting they accept limited reservations for parties of 4 or more or for special events.

The interior has a bigger-city vibe--they do a lot with the space that they have--and the outdoor patio in summer is wonderful (and dog friendly!)."}
{"text":"Above average quality rolls for good prices. As other people note, the sushi takes a little longer to come out than you would expect. But -- A female sushi chef -- AWESOME! 3 beers, two miso soups and 5 rolls for $52. We left stuffed! We will be back. We enjoyed the Grouper Roll in particular."}
{"text":"I would actually like to try their sashimi or nigiri before writing a legit review... but I enjoyed their rolls. Extra points for presentation and environment. Everything just feels very neat and clean. One time I tried to go, but the wait was too long, so we ended up going somewhere else. I suggest you make a reservation! 

I'll make sure to try their sashimi and update the review for those of you who care about that sort of thing. :)"}
{"text":"I am impressed! This place is up there with Muramoto! Fresh sashimi, good sushi. Job well done! 

Sure volcano is amazing. I love the crispy things with mayo sauce and the many shrimp on top. Was disappointed it was crab sticks and not real crab meat though. Triple decker was alright, like any multi-sashimi roll. 
Peking roll was too cooked for my taste. The duck turned out to be rather dry :( 

They had chi-toro!!! Not my usual fatty tuna, but it was good. 
I also liked their escolar sashimi. 
Quail eggs were not as tasty as muramoto's :/

Finally my drink - red lemonade. Tasted more like cough medication to me :( boo. 

Verdict - I'll be back for more sushi and sashimi, and maybe the chirashi too!"}
{"text":"This is the first review of the NEW Red, that just opened on West Washington Avenue less than a week ago... if you'd been to the other location on King Street, then you've never been to Red--and it's time to discover it! The decor is modern and unique; there's nothing cookie-cutter about it. There's a bar area, a sushi bar, indoor dining (with very comfortable seats!) and an outdoor seating area that's certain to be a hit. If you're looking for a private meeting room, ask at the front desk; it's elegant, discreet, and doesn't feel like a claustrophobic conference room, which private rooms often do. The new location tripled Red's previous space (quadrupled if you count outdoor seating) but the service hasn't suffered at all: The kitchen can keep up on both the quality and promptness end, and the servers and other staff are relentless and friendly. I was there for lunch, and one of the owners stepped in to refill my drink (promptly and with a smile) when things got too busy. It's the kind of positive, down to earth attitude that says a lot about a restaurant and the people who run it! On to the food: The heirloom tomato salad with red, yellow and green tomatoes, blue cheese and radicchio, was fresh and delicious. So was the spinach salad with avocado and edamame, which we ate with our eyes even before ordering it, when it arrived at the next table. The vegan rainbow roll with avocado and grilled vegetables was colorful, inviting, and tasted just terrific, and the spicy godzilla roll with tempura shrimp and cream cheese was a great choice too. Reservations are a really good idea, though we overheard that dinner reservations for Friday, Saturday and Sunday were already booked solid. Still, the restaurant always keeps 20 open tables for walk-ins, so if you haven't made reservations a few days in advance you won't be out of luck. The dinner menu and the dessert menu look great, but trying those was left for another day. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend Paul and a dude named Pablo. The place is really well-decorated and usually packed, so if you like a dense environment that feels like it's \"happening,\" Red Sushi is the place for you. I always try the sashimi platters at new sushi places so I can really gauge the quality of the fish and how it's prepared without any taste distraction from rice. It was definitely high-quality and tasty, especially the salmon. As for the rolls, my mind wasn't blown, but they were passeable. I think a lot of people like this place a ton not just because of the food but the atmosphere and the drinks. I don't drink, though, so I can't really speak to the latter, but Paul and Pablo seemed like they were having a good time on that front."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried sushi in many places in WI - many in Milwaukee (blegh!), Appleton (Meh), and up till now, one other spot in Madison (bummer!) - but we had the fortuitous chance to have Red Sushi - alas only for lunch on our recent trip - but it was a beacon in the dark!

Not only is it dark and cozy inside, I love all the red - and our waitress was very pleasant.

We both had miso soup (salty and good with just enough 'stuff' - good flavor I thought), and the \"chef picks 6 sushi, you pick one roll\" option :)

My husband picked the spicy salmon roll with avocado - and the sauce it came on was a delicious rendition divergent of normal spicy mayo sauce.

I ordered the 'Crunchy' tuna roll with avocado, jalapeno, cucumber, and wasabi aoila sans crunch.  I was kinda bummed as the wasabi aoili had no real flavor or kick, and the jalapeno was (no surprise, though I should have known) seedless and not spicy.

Still, the fish was fresh and the tastes were all good.

As for the sushi, of course the salmon was king.  What gave all six pieces a really nice touch was the delicacy of the tiny tobiko and scallions on top.  I felt like the chefs went the extra mile to care for their sushi and its presentation.

If we make it back for dinner, I'm excited to try the specialty rolls... I mean 'triple decker' sounds awesome!  As does the Buddha - and... well the list goes on.

Really glad we had a good lunch here, as of now - the best sushi we've had in this state!

Thanks Red Sushi!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great ambiance and Location! However, service was slow - it was a busy weekend though - Prices are high compared to other Sushi restaurants nearby but was justified since the quality of food was excellent."}
{"text":"Perfect girls night out.  Sat outside on sidewalk seating.  Awesome server. DELICIOUS fresh, high quality sushi. Great drinks."}
{"text":"We liked coming to this place until tonight.  Tonight, the server was condescending and rude.  Slow service.  We could see he treated us differently than his other tables. Crab rolls tasted fishy.  Rolls were falling apart when you picked them up.  We asked for extra wasabi and it was never brought to our table.  Plain rice tasted like peanuts."}
{"text":"The new RED location is PERFECT for a date. I've been there many times, and never feel out-of-place when I'm a little dressed up. The atmosphere is top-notch. Service is always great. Sometimes there is a wait to get seated, but there's a bar where you can sit and order drinks while you wait.

They have a wide selection of specialty cocktails and unique beers. The cocktails are expensive and really strong, so far the only one I've ordered there and liked is the lychee martini, but boy is it awesome.

I have high standards for sushi, and I'd say Red is \"good not great\". I'm still searching for my Madison sushi \"holy grail\" after moving here from Chicago last summer. Every time I order a spider roll here, the greens seems less-than-fresh, ultimately giving the roll a hint of \"deep fried garbage\" taste. Avoid the spider roll, friends.

The portion sizes are huge, I can barely eat two rolls where at other sushi places I might order three. My boyfriend and I made the mistake of ordering six rolls for the two of us the first time we dined here. Never again. Four rolls for two people is plenty and possibly even too much.

They have a wide selection of unique and seasonal rolls, but I've tried a lot of them and haven't really loved any of them. So can't make a recommendation there unfortunately.

If the sushi was better, RED would definitely get 5 stars from me - but to someone who's less picky about their sushi it would probably be considered pretty decent."}
{"text":"We hit Red Sushi on a Saturday night around 9:30pm and it was packed. The hostess had us go to the bar next door to have a drink while we waited. Not a problem, enjoyed a drink and she came to get us about 20 minutes later.
We ordered a bunch of sushi and an appetizer. The crowd was starting to subside, but it took a half hour before we got our appetizer, and another 15 minutes until the sushi arrived.
The sushi was okay, not nearly as good as Muramoto, but wasn't bad either. Prices were on par with everywhere else. Thought it would be a bit more reasonable, but that's okay.
The hostess and the waitress were very sweet. The waitress was a cute brunette who kept touching my shoulders every time she came by. I was hoping we could take her home with us as she looked very delicious!!
Anyway, I give them 5*'s for service, even if they couldn't make a few basic drinks we asked them for, but that waitress gave me nice tingles!!
3*'s for the food, as it was good. 1* for the long wait for our sushi.
We'd go back, but it's not as great as we'd hoped for.
Kissy"}
{"text":"The sushi here is too...modern for my tastes. Sure, the first bite or two is novel, but any more after that and I'm longing for the traditional stuff. 

Went here on a busy Monday evening and got the Super Volcano, Peking, and Dragon Roll. Super Volcano was the most flavorful of the three--mostly spicy and cream cheese, though, which got tedious to eat about halfway through. Peking was...an experiment I care not to repeat--the meat was slightly charred and left a bitter taste on the tongue and a burnt smell in the nostrils. The Dragon Roll was fine, if a bit under-flavored; I might as well have been eating a generic California Roll with a dab of diluted soy sauce....

Atmosphere was loud--so noisy it was hard to hear the person sitting across from me. It was also rather cramped and people had to squeeze in-between tables (hoping no one gets too close a view of their backsides?) to get to some of the seats.

Next time I'm out for sushi, it's not going to be here."}
{"text":"Went on my first date in 15 years ...this was the perfect place ...hip beautifully done ...service was great! Coat room ...food was amazing ...i would recommend this place to any sushi lover. Only downside..parking..dont let that stop you...you won't regret going! Cannot wait to go back and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The salmon sashimi was clearly low quality salmon, being chewy and sinewy, a letdown. I had the Usagi roll, which I assume had eel in it, but you could not taste the eel, as there was far too much avocado and cucumber, etc. It may be the best in Madison, but this is not worth the money."}
{"text":"I have eaten at RED once. I had lunch. All I can say is that the experience was perfect, from the design of the restaurant to the quality of the food. The cost was a little high for my wallet but I felt like I got my money's worth.

I went to RED with two of my buddies from Aquacise class. We are always hungry after our workout and we decided to try something new. We walked into RED and were struck by the beauty of the room. The sun was shining and the open, Asian decor was lovely. The place was packed and we were lucky to score a rounded booth which helped to keep down the din. Service was good and the waitress was able to answer our questions.

We were eating lunch which helped to keep the cost down ($20/pp, no alcohol). The rolls were exquisite and oh, so fresh. I do not remember the choices we made but all were equally delicious. The waitress asked if we would like to try their fresh wasabi. She brought us a tiny bowl and none of us was particularly impressed. We were very surprised to be charged for this and the cost seemed ridiculous for such a serving.

I look forward to lunching at RED again!"}
{"text":"Dear Madison,

Yes, you are eating sushi in Wisconsin. Lower your expectations, or catch your own tuna. For sushi of the midwest, this place is awesome.

The atmosphere is cool - thank you darkness! Great spot for a date. Sitting at the bar is lovely, sitting at the tables are lovely (although if you get weirded out by the traditional Madison table layout where all of the tables are *veryclosetogether* you might not love that)...and there is outdoor seating!

You will probably have to wait if you walk in on a Friday or Saturday, but you can leave your number."}
{"text":"For my friend birthday last night we had a group at Red Sushi and wow, it was delicious!  Maybe the best in Madison.

Without going into too much detail, Red Sushi is a small little quaint place and I am willing to bet on a weekend it is hard to get into. But we sat down around 7:00 and left around 9:20.   it does take a while everyone.

After a bottle of wine with the wife our rolls came out.  Now the table had many rolls and I sampled a lot of them but as far as the rolls we ordered...

The Surf & Turf roll was AMAZING!  I was so impressed with it I just want more.  It was delicious and just done to perfection. We also sampled the Bagel Roll and it was pretty much a deep fried Philly Roll and very good.  My wife and I both also enjoyed the Atlantic roll very much.

Now, why do we not see 5 stars?  Well the wait is part of that but that's what I expect at a place like this.  The only issue is I did not expect it to take 2 hours as we only had a sitter till 9:00.  Also somebody in our party did not get a roll she ordered till after everyone was done eating and that was disappointing.

But all in all a great place with some great food.  Warning: the soy sauce is VERY SALTY."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here on a Tuesday and were seated right away. The ambiance is really cool however I wasn't a fan of how close together the tables were. You could hear every single word coming out of the mouths of those around you.

Save the far too intimate seating, the service was great. We got our order in quick and the drinks and sushi came out very fast. And thank god it did because these people know sushi. 

Edamame - same old same old, but good.
Super volcano roll - dynamite. It combined all of my favorite things into one roll. Only bad part was it was so hard to eat - I had to eat the roll and toppings separate, but I did not mind.
Tropical roll with spicy tuna - if you're a fan of the traditional spicy tuna roll, this is for you. They combine our favorite spicy tuna with delicious and fresh mango. Awesome sauce. 

I can't remember what my friend ordered, probably because I was so focused on my delicious rolls. But she said hers were just as fantastic. 

I don't know if I'd venture here on a busier night, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can say for certain this is the best sushi I've had in Madison, but it's also the only sushi I've had here.  Compared to other sushi I've had in the Midwest it's good.  I wasn't wowed by the flavors or how well they were rolled.  Also note I didn't try the sashimi.  The spicy salmon roll was probably the best.  It was very fresh and had a good blend of spices no spices were to bold or over powering.  The spicy tuna was interesting, it had a strong chili pepper taste.  The tempura shrimp was lacking all around.  I've tried several other rolls, I don't remember each one, but some of them were very good, but most only good.

Overall it's is good I'd go again, but it is more expensive than I'd expect for Madison and for the quality.  I've had better for less in Milwaukee and Chicago.  It can also be very hard to get a table so make a reservation.  Fortunately, I live across the street so if there's an hour wait I can just go home and come back or get it to go, but if you don't want to wait you need a reservation, even for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. Management here gets it right!!! Not your typical Madison, WI restaurant . This place is a cut about. Thank you for a wonderful evening!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Initially we were going to check out Wonder Bar Supper Club but we cringed at the sound of steak bc we'd been noshing all day. Sushi at RED was the better option. Atmosphere was lively and service was good. We only order two entrees. 
I ordered Spicy Godzilla roll minus the cream cheese. The roll was basically a shrimp tempura roll. What made this dish great was all the crunch they put on top of the roll! So good! We also ordered Ramen. Outstanding broth and good noodles, but what I didn't understand was the ground pork. Why was the meat ground? I've never seen ground meat in ramen before. Also they were charging $3 for pork belly. Pork belly didn't come with it. Both dishes were really delicious! Desserts looked Instagram worthy. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Madison if you ask me! Try the super volcano roll! My friend lives in San Francisco where they have really good sushi, but every time she is back in Madison she insists we go to Red for the super volcano roll.

They also do a good spicy tuna roll (basic but good). And really good seaweed salad. Their seasonal roles are super interesting and fun to try! 

Lychee martinis are delicious, as are most of their cocktails."}
{"text":"Good for both new sushi eaters and the seasoned!! The volcano roll is amazing! Usually a short wait but you can stop at a nearby bar for a drink and they text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Madison last week for 4 days to see friends.  We went out to Red Sushi one night and had a really nice time.  The food, the service, and the cozy atmosphere were really great.  

The sushi and sashimi were the best that I have ever had, and I have had it a lot.  The appetizers and rolls were all great too.  We'll be back for sure on our next visit."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and location. It's a great spot and wonderful decorations inside. 

Service wasn't great though and the Tsunami roll needs less coconut sauce on it. If you order the Tsunami roll be sure to order with less sauce on it and it will be fantastic. 

The other rolls we got were great! The Spider Roll was delicious and the Miso soup was good as well. Would recommend the place but watch out for the Tsunami roll sauce and possible bad service. I've heard the service can be wonderful but this experience wasn't the case."}
{"text":"Beautiful and  artistic presentation.   Beyond our expectations.      I agree with most of the reviews regarding wait time. n However,  Its just the way it is in a popular, small place.    If you get in ,,, good for you!"}
{"text":"So Red has been on my list for a long time and I finally got a chance to visit. The menu is massive and almost overwhelming. The space is very small and it makes it tough to have a nice date here because you are literally next to other people even though you are at your own table.

The sushi is modern and fusion-esque. They have sushi with fruit and other things you would not consider putting in sushi. I really enjoyed the Peking roll that has duck and plum sauce. But overall, I think they try to do too much with the sushi. Each roll was massive and loaded down with \"stuff.\"

Some people may like this style of sushi but I like the more traditional approach to sushi. If you're a fan of sushi, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I was amazed at the quality and variety of the food here. A bit cramped for a weeknight, but great location. We were a party of 12 and everyone thought the food was excellent. The waitress serving us was an amiable but focused whirlwind - kept drinks coming, got all orders correct and was unphased by dealing w separate checks!

Great place."}
{"text":"Service: Waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our server, he actually seemed bothered that he had to wait on my friend and I.  Throughout our evening he did warm up a bit and checked on us two times.  The hostess was rather rude, and ignored us altogether when refilling the other customers' water.

Drinks:  The martinis were wonderful, I highly suggest the Lyche martini.

Sushi: Was wonderful as usual, very fresh and believe it or not we got it right after ordering.  (In the past we have waited 30 plus minutes for sushi and the place wasn't even busy).

I just with our server had been a little more attentive and that the hostess/water girl would have paid attention to my water."}
{"text":"Appetizer- veggie tempura.  Nothing unexpected here.  Some raw batter.  Limited vegetable selection overall."}
{"text":"I had my first visit to Red Sushi for lunch in late December. It's not a large place but it is tastefully decorated. They open at 11:30. I arrived at 11:35 and by 11:45 they were full.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive. She had recommendations for sushi and beer. I ordered the Sushi Lunch which includes 6 pieces of chef's choice sushi & a roll. I really appreciated the chef's choice sushi because in addition to the standard salmon, tuna, and red snapper, it included sea bass and amber jack. Our waitress identified each type of fish when she delivered the dish. The roll was also fresh and tasty. The price for what you get was reasonable.

The entire experience was very satisfying. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went with my 2 roommates, though I really wish I took a girl there instead. 

The atmosphere is very cozy and intimate. You're seated in tiny booths close together, with low lighting and refined upholstery. It'd definitely make for a great date spot. 

Now on to the service. Our waitress was very friendly and outgoing, and seemed knowledgeable about the menu. We took up her suggestion on getting the miso soup with some sriracha, and were delightfully pleased. The spiciness of the hot sauce really added a kick to the soup, and made it even more flavorful.

The sushi they offer is pretty standard in terms of pricing and variety. However, having tried a few of their sushi, I would recommend their \"specialty\" rolls over the usual ones. The price increase is definitely justified with better taste, and you won't leave feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"Red sushi is I think one of the best places for sushi in town. They have a wide selections of nigiris and specialty rolls that would fulfilled both taste and authenticity. 

Good selections of a sake as well , filtered and unfiltered, hot and cold; they offer 3 \"pour size\" to either self-indulge or share!

Must try their negitoro maki (fatty tuna with green onions)! 

One thing I would like to see from them (or any Japanese restaurants here really) is to add more hot appetizers or snacks like agedashi tofu, takoyaki, okonomiyaki to their menu.... THEN I think I don't have to keep going to Chicago for my fix!"}
{"text":"While traveling I stopped here during happy hour as my hotel was across the street. The overall feel of the location was very comfortable and modern.  I sat at the bar and i'm glad that I did because the bartender was great.  Very helpful and really friendly without being overbearing.  Happy hour offering were limited but high quality and large portions.  The yellowtail sashimi was one of the best that I have had to date at many locations around the US.  Highly recommend but if cost is an issue stick to happy hour."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Madison! Huge selection of rolls! The only thing that would make this place better is if it was larger, and that's taken care of with their new location! Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this restaurant five stars so bad. I got in late from a day full of traveling and was staying across the street at the Hyatt place. My colleague and I were craving a strong drink and some good food. It was freezing outside, we are California people so we didn't feel like walking around to try to find a place. Red was our best option. We ran across the street, we were able to get a good seat right away. The service was great. The reason why I couldn't give it five stars is because I ordered my usual extra dry vodka martini. It came out with far too much vermouth in it. I had to send it back which I don't like doing. The bartender made it over the way I asked him to and it was delicious. I gave him the nod of approval from across the room and we were good. If not for that hiccup, this restaurant would've definitely had five stars. My colleague considers himself a sushi guru, and even mentioned once during the night that this may be the best sushi he's ever had. The appetizers are great. Definitely order at least one thing from the dinner menu. I had to get a seaweed salad and crispy rice spicy tuna because it's my go to. We also tried the salmon sushi. Between the drinks, the appetizers, and the sushi we were looking at $100 tab between the two of us. That is to be expected. The environment and ambience is really impressive. I didn't know what to expect from the Madison Wisconsin restaurant scene since I've never been there. I was very impressed and I would definitely go back again. Actually, I might go back again tonight."}
{"text":"Fabulous and great tasting. Everyone in the family wants to come here for their birthday dinner. It was crowded but we opted to sit at the bar. Watching sushi being made has us planning on what to order next time."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks later, RED is still my favorite! The scallop appetizer was amazing! There were only two scallops, but they were decently large. This time I got the Tsunami roll, which I loved. I guess I just really like cream cheese in my sushi... not the healthiest obsession. The seasonal Ocean Breeze has been on the menu in the past. It tastes fresh yet has a hint of smoky, which isn't my favorite flavor, but it was still good. Can't wait for the next time!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!  Terrible rule and host that night.  They do not allow sake bombs...what!!!??

I have always loved Red, the sushi is great.  One of the few sushi places my vegetarian wife loves to visit.  

The new location is a beautiful place and should be easier to park, especially in the dead of winter. 

Bring back the sake."}
{"text":"Had high expectations going in based on multiple friends recommendations. All expectations were met. Great sushi as reasonable price (for high end sushi). It's a pretty popular place and isn't big. Stop by and put your name in or expect a wait."}
{"text":"I've been a fan before they moved and still a fan now. Red sushi is on point and amazing.

I come from a state where sushi for All You Can Eat is $17-$22 so it kind of hurts my soul inside when I see that one roll can cost up to $22 (never ordered that high before). I can say though that since it's ala carte, the fish is definitely fresh, ingredients are delicious, staff is wonderful, and location is superb.

I've been here on every trip to Madison and they still get me every time. I love their Crunchy Salmon Roll. For me, I love spicy so I pretty much asked Sriracha on the side so I can give it a kick.

Red always do good on their rolls, I just wish it was a little bit cheaper as I can try more than two rolls per visit but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I heard this place was overpriced and avoided it for years going to Muramoto instead. Then my friend asked me to go with him because he goes weekly for dinner with his roommate and his roommate was out of town. Hearing that he goes weekly sparked my interest. 

I had the Salmon lover roll and he had the dragon roll. 
The price and quality were very impressive. 

I also enjoy the décor. They don't overprice the food just because they have nice interiors which can be annoying. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The mod space and lovely hosts and wait staff stick out in my mind more than the food. I stopped in with a friend and we each sampled two rolls. While the quality of the fish was solid, there was not much more notable about the rolls. The neighboring table was doing the chef's menu which looked phenomenal."}
{"text":"Not your typical Sushi Bar!!

I was in town for business and wanted sushi. Most college towns have at least one good sushi restaurant.  This place rocks. I will be back. The bar is a great place to sit and watch the sushi and drinks being made. I had edamame , Red and Black and Salmon Lover. All was great. I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Andy & I love sushi and have been hearing rave reviews about this place for quite some time so I'm glad we were finally able to check it out. The decor is swanky and modern yet still cozy. Their rolls are definitely on the pricey end but the flavor and attention to detail is worth it. Definitely try the spicy tuna crunchy rice appetizer. They are little squares of awesomeness. I also had the Orange roll which was stuffed with huge tempura shrimp. The flavor was spot on but it could've benefited from some type of sauce. Usually I don't dip my sushi in soy sauce but this time I had to just because it was so dry. Andy got the Butterfly roll which he loved but I thought was horrible. To each his own I suppose. The drinks were overpriced so we'll probably skip that next time but all in all the sushi is really great quality so I imagine we'll be back."}
{"text":"Love their sushi!  Great bartender makes me yummy,  festive mock tails (something I eternally search for), but above all, the New Year's 9-course Omakase was the BOMB!  Lots of umami flavors from land and sea, perfectly portioned to make us pleasingLy full, not sick.   Great variety, with each course a delight.  Partner had the wine pairing, reported that the white wines were spectacular, the reds \"a little young.\"  Thank you!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So happy that I got to try this place! This is the second location in Madison and is very nicely decorated across from the Hyatt and with tons of parking around. (free after 6pm)! This was also my first time having sushi in madison and forgive me for not having too high expectations since i'm from California, but honestly this place was really good!

We started with a bowl of Ramen, and boy... was it good. It had just the right amount of spice and the noodles were authentic and cooked perfectly. the al dente of ramen! The meat was flavorful and I loved the bamboo shoots. Dont even get me started on the broth. it had a ton of flavor and i'm definitely coming back here to get my ramen fix. 

We proceeded to get 5 different rolls, the tropical roll with spicy tuna, philly roll, chicken teriyaki roll, orange crush, and California roll. We were hosting some new comers and wanted to keep it a little safe so thats the story behind our order and honestly it was a great start! I love salmon and spice to the orange crush was the perfect roll with shrimp tempura, crunch, and salmon on top. 

I can't wait to come back here and try other rolls! Til then, happy eating!!"}
{"text":"We just have to give this Sushi restaurant a 5 star!
Consistently superior service (Ryan Lockwood is a professional!) 
The food is beyond exceptional! Each and EVERY time we eat here the service and food do not disappoint! Jack, the head chef, and owner is always there and is an amazing culinary artist! The freshest seafood in Madison, we learned they get 6 deliveries a week! 
The volcano and the spider are among our favorites. The flavor combinations are amazing!
The interior of this new location is gorgeous, you feel you are In a down-town Chicago restaurant. Cool music, with a very hip vibe!
Reservations are strongly suggested but if there's just two of you then there's an easier chance at getting a table quickly.  If there is a wait, it will be worth it!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in town. I used to be a big Muramoto fan but until I went to Red sushi. Love it !!!! The sushi are so different and creative like no others ;-) gotta try it!!!!!!!!! seriously!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi.  Customer service was great.  Great environment.  Cleanliness was superb.  Highly recommended to try!"}
{"text":"Best sushi you'll find in Madison. Great ambience, small location, be prepared to wait for a table on the weekend. Seating is close to one another so be ready to get cozy. Service is great, the food is spectacular. I also start with a seaweed salad and add a regular and special roll. The food and service is very consistent. You'll often see Jack, the head chef, behind the sushi bar. They offer great lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit family in the area each summer and the adults search far and wide for a great place to eat each year. This year we chose Red and it was the best decision! The sushi is amazing. We all loved what we ordered. I ordered the Ramen and found it to be spectacular! I loved the ground pork in it, there were plenty of noodles cooked perfectly. The broth was clear and spicy with dots of chili oil on top. The soft boiled egg was a perfect accent. I just loved it! If you get the chance, try this establishment. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Madison.  I eat here about once a week, and the food is consistently good.  My favorite rolls are the super volcano, bagel, tropical roll (with salmon), and the amigo.  Their rolls are always fresh and the staff is always friendly. Make a reservation if you can, the place seems always packed.  Good place to order to-go, also.  HANDS DOWN BEST SUSHI PLACE IN MADISON - and I've tried them all.  

Moving out of state soon and I'm going to miss Red Sushi awfully!  It will always be on my \"to visit\" list when I come back to Madison."}
{"text":"For a date night or special occasion restaurant in Madison, this is at the top of the list. Definitely make reservations for a weekend night. They have a  bar area where you get a cocktail before your tables ready, but the space is limited. The menu includes many options for seasonal, cooked and raw sushi (at least a dozen vegetarian/vegan choices too) as well as non-sushi entrees to please most palates. The chef(s) were rather quick with the 4 orders of sushi and one order of sashimi we shared. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful and was beautifully presented. Our server was friendly and helpful and put a birthday candle on my fiancé's plate for a sweet touch. Prices range from 6$ for vegetarian tempura rolls to up to 22$ for the most expensive rolls. I know some may worry about leaving a sushi restaurant still hungry, but we didn't have room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sushi in Madison.  The new space is beautiful, the fish is fresh, beer is cold and the staff is wonderful.  

Get the super volcano.  It is outrageous."}
{"text":"The Ocha Cooler is very deceiving. Is there any alcohol in it? I don't think there is. Until I have two and go back to my hotel room. There definitely was, and it was delicious, as was the spicy tuna roll and the Red roll. The miso was good, although cold, but, whatever, who cares."}
{"text":"Really good quality sushi. The 1.8 L wakatake is awesome too. Square location both good and bad. The location is a little small. Recommend reservations."}
{"text":"I have been eating sushi since I was a child all over the East coast.  The atmosphere of this place was great, very friendly staff.  Sushi menu had a decent size selection.  I will say that it was overpriced in my opinion.  The sushi was pretty good but I've had better quality and quantity for far less, even in bigger cities.  I was disappointed after spending $45 (3 items) that I was still hungry.  Very disappointed that a Japanese restaurant didn't have fresh brewed ice tea.  I would come back if invited but won't be venturing back on my own."}
{"text":"This was some of the best sushi I have ever had! 

I came here with my family on a Friday night. The restaurant was very crowded and there was not a lot of options for waiting. There is a small area outside the restaurant or a bar area. 

We walked up to the bar and ordered some drinks. The drink that I had was a special vodka cocktail and it was amazing! Super delicious and very well made. My sister ordered a gin cocktail that was okay, definitely need to love gin if you are going to order it! The only issue was that the bartenders seemed very put off by something. We were not rude or asking for much so it was a little weird. 

Once seated we ordered some appetizers. We got the sticky rice with spicy tuna and the edamame. They were both delicious. The edamame was well salted and warm. The sticky tuna rice was so well done, I could have eaten it all night.

We finally ordered our main courses. My sister and I split three rolls. We ordered the spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and the badger roll. The shrimp tempura and spicy tuna were to die for. Amazing rolls and so fresh. Some of the best sushi I have ever had. The badger roll was OK but it had cream cheese in it which messed up the flavors. I would skip it next time and stick to a recommendation. 

Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals. My cousin and mom ordered vegetarian rolls and a vegan one which they adored. My aunt, dad, and other cousin ordered some rolls (can't remember the names) but they said the fatty tuna was the best. 

Our waiter was great, very knowledgeable and quick. The atmosphere was awesome and I loved the interior. It is definitely a nicer restaurant but if you're looking for high-quality sushi, Red is your place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi, and this is by far the best sushi anywhere around Madison.  We always get the vegetable tempura for an appetizer; it has a light breading and is delicious.  We've tried most of the rolls here and love them all. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Chop-Stix down.... one of the best places to get your Sushi fix in Madtown!! 

The food is fresh and fast - The staff is TOP-NOTCH!

Our go-to items are the spicy tuna roll and the mushroom tempura (hold the tempura) roll! I think I could easily live off these two rolls.... but what good would this review be if it only talked about those two rolls?

The seaweed salad used to be fantastic and is still a great light start to your meal, it just seems a little heavy on the cucumbers now. The maguro (Bluefin or Bigeye) are both excellent options as well as the fresh oysters on the half shell. These items are also staples for me when I go out and I have not been disappointed at RED. The tiger roll and king triton roll are both excellent options - I especially enjoyed the large crispy shrimp tempura in the king triton!

They have a limited number of tables available for reservations and only for parties of 4+ and the place is always packed. They are opening a new location soon with about 3 times more space!! Hopefully that will help alleviate some of the wait times.

If you haven't tried RED you should!!!"}
{"text":"Great, GREAT sushi.  Fresh fish, delicious rolls and sashimi.  We'll be back.  

Only knock is that my cocktail wasn't the best, but my wife's was great.  Try and sit outside for a good view of the capital."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Gets busy fast. Came in a Monday and it had a 30 minute wait. Great food. Delicious and fresh fish. Best sushi in Madison by far."}
{"text":"This place has good sushi and some pretty creative rolls as well. The service was good mid-week, yet I suspect like all the places on this strip that they can bog down pretty easily. The prices are reasonable and If I had any complaints it is the growing popularity of cream cheese in rolls (which I despise yet seems to be everywhere) and that they are often 'out' of one thing or another... Don't let that stop you from going to Red, it's a nice place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service, dining, atmosphere. Always a fun experience. Any dish you'd try is tasty. Large selection of wine and cocktails crafted. Highly recommend either you visit or looking for a place to dine/lunch. The deserts are yummy."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison. That's a fact not an opinion. This sushi bar puts murramotto to shame with quality of fish, ambience, and service. We started off with an array of sashimi. Yellow tail-helllloooo it is a staple at any sushi joint- snapper, eel, and a few other raw buttery pieces of fish. Stellar! They were super fresh. Then we ordered 4 raw rolls which I can't even remember what all of them were called but the one with the cucumber around it (lollipop) was interesting. Our server gave me a fork to eat it. How in Japanese haha. Speaking of service, we had the option to put our name in for a table or eat at the bar. We ate at the bar. We were starving so I pretty much just told our server (who was excellent) to start us off with a few sashimi, a few raw rolls, and then go out with a big ending with cooked rolls. Her recommendations we're awesome and did not disappoint. Only reason I'm giving Red 4 not 5 stars is they were 86d oysters. I love oysters and wanted them so bad. Grrrrrrrr. That's life though. Roll, or sushi roll, with the punches. Ok, that was lame. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Red because of the great reviews we saw on Google and Yelp. We sat at the bar area. Our server/bartender was Michael... At least I assume that was his name according to our receipt. He barely said anything to us and barely made eye contact. He never even respond when we said, \"Thank you.\" when we did. I had bad service before but I must say, this was the absolute worst service I have ever gotten. When you're working in the hospitality industry, you need to be hospitable. Definition of hospitality, \"The friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers.\" He didn't say hi, didn't ask how our food was, did not bother to check up on up after we received our drinks and food... and disappeared towards the end. He was not the person that brought us our check. A taller gentleman with glasses did, who was very nice. Other workers in the restaurant were attentive as well. Michael was more attentive to his co-workers as opposed to customers. Giving high fives, laughing, and joking...

I work in the hospitality industry, people like Michael boggles my mind. Why is he working in this industry? Having a bad day? Suck it up and leave it outside before coming into work.

As for the food, the rolls were decent. 3 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Not only one of the best (if not, the best) spot for sushi in Madison, but they have quite a few other great things going for them. The interior design of their new space is incredible. They covered every little detail, from using another one of my favorite local businesses, Red Square Flowers, for the floral design, to creating amazing flow through lighting, colors, etc., I would recommend everyone visit RED to see what an interior space can be. Besides sushi, they have an array of other fine dishes such as steak, seasonal salads, duck and appetizers. I see the owners, Tanya and Jack (head chef), there most nights I'm in to dine. I've seen Tanya help her team out by being host, food-runner, etc., and taking the time to find out how guests are enjoying themselves. Hands down, one of my favorite Madison businesses and restaurants for so many reasons."}
{"text":"Amazing! When we travel from our hometown we ALWAYS get sushi. Red Sushi was recommended and had the highest ratings on Yelp. We were not even close to disappointed. The options were amazing, the seasonal specialty rolls were to die for, and the service was friendly and quick. I would highly recommend Red Sushi to anyone traveling to Madison. And, I suggest the Candy Apple roll. SO good!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've ever been to. The volcano roll is my favorite. Surf n turf roll is pretty good too. Try the beef short rib! There are several different flavors of saki, I fancy the cherry blossom."}
{"text":"Visited this evening for the first time and was extremely pleased. I am very picky when it comes to eat sushi and was very pleasantly surprised that in the cheese and dairy state I could find great sushi. The only reason why I only have four stars isa due to how small this place is. Other than that awesome! I had the lollipop roll which consisted of a cucumber roll with fresh fish, crab and asparagus in the center with an awesome beautifully painted sauce on my plate. Fish was so fresh and tender. I also ordered the fire cracker roll which was amazing."}
{"text":"I ate here on a whim. I had tickets for an event at the Overture Center and wanted to find a sit-down restaurant nearby, so off to Red I went! I'd never eaten at Red before. Hands down, this is the best sushi in all of Madison. Better than Muramoto. There, I said it.

Pros:
-Brussels sprouts petals appetizer: I have never had better Brussels sprouts! The cook/char on the petals was incredible, and all of the unique and contrasting flavors of the balsamic reduction, crunchy petals, candied lemon and crunchy puffed rice worked together perfectly. This is the type of dish that should be winning some sort of culinary award if it hasn't already.
-Seaweed salad: Extremely fresh and super earthy. The flavor was great, and the texture was amazing. I felt sad when I was finished with my salad. I wanted more!
- Sushi: We tried a variety of rolls, and they were all superb. The fish was very fresh, and all of the ingredients were clean and crisp-tasting. The rolls were all very well thought out, with various flavors/textures that worked together really well.
- Service: Our server was fantastic. His name was Ryan (or Bryan?). He was prompt and attentive but also witty and funny. He asked if we had any allergies or concerns that the chef should know about. My husband joked that we were allergic to raw fish and seaweed. Ryan joked back, \"okay, enjoy your water.\"
- Ambiance: Cool, trendy atmosphere and decor. The EDM music is fun. The atmosphere doesn't really lend itself to a family-friendly, cozy environment, but that's okay. I really liked the modern, fast-paced feel.

Cons:
-I typically write pros/cons in my Yelp reviews. This time, though, I can't think of any cons!

My experience at Red has put this restaurant on my favorite Madison restaurant list. I'm absolutely going back."}
{"text":"I enjoy Red. However, there always seems to be a mix up or a problem. I went to Red for lunch this week. Somehow our order ticket got stuck to a take our order we were told and so our food didn't get made. It took over 45 minutes to get our food. About six months prior something similar happened and it took a long time to get our food.

The food itself is great. I'm not a sushi eater but they always have great alternatives. I really enjoyed the Ramen I had this week. The broth is delicious and just the right amount of spice. The seaweed salad is also excellent. Just be sure you aren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Top notch sushi, service, atmosphere, location....!!

The sushi, first and foremost, was beautifully presented, DELICIOUS and plentiful.  I ordered 3 rolls and couldn't finish everything, so ignore the reviews about small portions.

Be sure to make a reservation! 

Bring a hot date!!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation on open table because we had heard that it was difficult to just walk in.  We showed up 30 min early and they were able to seat us right away (it was Sunday). Our server Matthew was very fast to the table a very descriptive with the menu.  We had the Chef's choice sushi and sashimi and the seasonal Sea Special which was a squid ink linguine with clams and bacon.  All of the food was delicious and Mathew took the time to identify all of the types of fish.  We had a bottle of Pinot Grigio and the blueberry hibiscus ice cream and the bill was surprisingly reasonable.  Great first night in Madison."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in town, with excellent service and polite waiters. The large menu can seem daunting, but they do most items well. They also have 'traditional' fare like sake, quail eggs, Asian slaw and Kobe beef. There are several sushi options without fish for those on the mild side.  Downsides are the close quarters and price...you may wait an hour to sit very close to strangers, while paying more than other sushi places in Madison. Still love to go here, and have a beer next door while we wait. 

Opens at 11:30...so no 11 lunches."}
{"text":"This review is for those people trapped in a sushi world but who do not like sushi.....Yeah, I know, Red is \"the\" sushi place.  So here I am, at a business meeting and I am stuck.  Then I see it.  The savior!  A burger.  Yes.  Give it to me.  As long as it did not swim here, I am great with it.  

And then it happened.  A giant monstrosity was served to me.  It was love at first bite.  Great flavor, juicy and cooked nicely.  There was an aoili, an onion ring and a brioche bun.  I wanted to eat the whole thing but I didn't wear stretch pants.  

I am now making excuses to go back!"}
{"text":"Parking is difficult. We were actually towed, so don't park in ally across the street. Sushi is good, but with the higher prices you would expect in large cities. This reminds me of Sushi restaurants you find on either coast of the US, and all the good and bad associated with such. Upscale, pricey, with fresh sushi and solid service. Great place to go on a date, but hit up Takara if you eat sushi every week."}
{"text":"Had dinner for 1 here. Enjoyed a selection of appetizers. The seafood salad is very good, as well as the shumai and dumplings. Nice mackerel sushi, cured. Busy, cozy atmosphere. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Love the vibe in this place. The sushi was great. I loved the crispy chick pea salad and budda and tiger rolls. Prices were decent. It did take a long time once we ordered. We had rolls gluten free and they did tell us that it would take longer because they had to swap out the rice for gluten free rice so wasn't sure if that was it but it did take 30 min plus after order. Long wait. Lots of gluten free options and they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison. Jack, the owner, knows his craft and exudes perfection through his dishes. Staff is great. Atmosphere is hip. But the real reason my wife and I keep coming back is purely for the sushi.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The biggest problem is deciding what to eat, given their extensive menu.  Lots of excellent rolls for under $6.  And, if you want to get deluxe rolls, there is no shortage of unique combinations that are well worth the extra expense.   The place is on the small side, so make a reservation on the weekend."}
{"text":"Loved the food and enjoyed the Vegan Menu.  Server was great, attentive and friendly.  We ate out on the patio in the back of the restaurant and all had a great time!"}
{"text":"Slow service with good food.  

Although the bartender got us waters right away the rest of the process took a long time.  We ordered sushi that took 25 minutes for the first roll to come out and then had another roll that followed 5-7 minutes later.   For being a small location with a lot of cooks this place was disappointing."}
{"text":"We left almost immediately after being seated. Two things you need know about this restaurant: 1) glasses of water were soapy, 2) they charge extra for wasabi or ginger (even if you order a $27 chefs choice sushi plate). The menu is pricey enough (I wouldn't mind paying), but don't play the a la carte game; it's obnoxious and ridiculous."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in the city!

Vegan and vegetarian options aplenty. My favorites are the avocado roll and the vegetable tempura roll (which you can get both of for $9 on lunches!). Their pickled ginger is also the best I've ever had and the service is amazing!

They also do takeout, which is ready pretty quickly."}
{"text":"We always loved RED when they were at the Capitol but rarely went because of the cramped space. With the new location they have plenty of seating so waits are much more reasonable now. We enjoyed our food so much I ended up organizing a ~12 person group dinner for a surprise birthday party. The person who took my appointment and booked the private room accidentally messed up and double booked. A manager called me and apologized profusely. Without me asking for it they offered free champagne, a refund of the deposit, free dessert, and free decorations. They let our friends arrive early and set up additional table decorations. They more than made up for their mistake and it ended up being a great night.

I told this to a friend who opens, operates, and manages restaurants for a living and they did everything you would expect a high-end restaurant in a major city to do when a mistake happens. 

We love going back at least once a month and we always order all the seasonal rolls. Their chef comes up with some unique and delicious ideas each season. The rolls are large and make up for the $20+ cost the more expensive rolls can cost. We're very happy and we look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love Red, convenient new location not far from the capitol. Love their sushi (wide variety of options on the menu) and great appetizers."}
{"text":"Loved that they text you when your table is ready! That allowed us to walk around and enjoy the Capitol during our wait instead of being cramped in the front door.
The food was amazing. I got a rainbow roll, which is my \"go to\" sushi roll...but this one was incredible. The fish was so fresh and flavorful, and the presentation was beautiful! We tried their special of the day on the recommendation of the waitress, and that also was unbelievable. My only complaint is that it was very loud and it was difficult to hear across the table. Food wise, it was perfect."}
{"text":"We were driving through town and found this spot on Yelp. This was first rate, memorable sushi! We eat a lot of sushi back home in Detroit, and on our travels, and we had never before been to a place that offers multiple rice blends as Red does - tasty and distinctive! The fish was melt in your mouth fresh. The flavor and texture combinations are imaginative. We enjoyed every roll we ordered. Oh, and they have craft cocktails! Definitely some refined mixology going on there. I wish Red was right around the corner from where we live. Service was a little pretentious, but the food and spirits outshines the rest."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic--when you can get a table. 

The good: the fish is always fresh, and the ingredients in their rolls are always tasty. I would highly recommend the calamari tempura as an appetizer--it literally melts in your mouth. I've never had bad service from waitstaff, and the drinks are tasty.

The bad: there is about a 50/50 chance that I'm actually able to get a table in under an hour. There is sometimes space at the sushi bar, but that's really not my cup of tea. Usually, there are tables reserved for 10-20 people in a restaurant that maybe holds 40. Because they block off huge proportions of the tiny restaurant, there's never a table available. I would love to make reservations, but they only take them for groups of four or more. I'm sorry that I'm not a coastie gurl here to take #selfies with 9 other gurls in my sorority.

Change your reservation policy, and this review would easily be five stars."}
{"text":"Brilliant place, excellent vegan options. Had the tofu teriyaki, avocado rolls and vegan rolls, and the red slaw. I enjoyed everything but I could probably do without the vegan rolls frankly. Beverages were excellent as well! Colleague got a desert which was lovely as well. All in all this place does it right."}
{"text":"FRESH sushi, SPECTACULAR cocktails and great customer service. We ordered a spicy tuna roll and a spicy tuna on crispy rice, it was freshly rolled. 5 stars to everything we order. We didn't try dessert because the kitchen closed at 10 so make sure to get there earlier.
Quality- 10/10
Atmosphere- 8/10
Creativity- 7/10
-A&R"}
{"text":"Tried uni for the first time and it was pretty great. Red is classy in its new location. Lots of space,  but a little noisy. They make a strong martini

*edited because I misspelled uni"}
{"text":"It's a great treat to be at Red. Great sake selection. Tried salmon lovers, dragon, seven sins, spicy volcano, spicy scallop rolls. All turning out really well. Just a bit disappointed with the creme brûlée, it was way undercooked. Otherwise great seating, lovely atmosphere, and our waiter is being awesome ! Can't really go wrong with red, being refreshing, elegant and delicious. Quite right."}
{"text":"I came to Madison to go check out the capitol building. I hadn't eaten breakfast or lunch so I strolled in here craving some sushi. 

It was $28 for a sashimi plate of about 8 different fish. The plate layout was fancy. The sashimi itself was satisfying. The fish were fresh enough. Came with a bowl of rice.

The establishment is fancy and dark. lol
Prices are a little more expensive than what I'm used to, but it may also be because its right next to the capitol building.
Service is good.
Street parking around."}
{"text":"The Super Volcano roll was a very pleasant experience and the traditional rolls are probably the best value in Madison. It does tend to get a bit crowded for dinner and the meal is nothing life-changing but still a very solid sushi experience."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious but what ruined it was a hair on our plate and plastic wrap from when the chef rolls the sushi.  The hair was so gross!"}
{"text":"After my really disappointing experience with Red last year, I decided to give them another shot. On par with Takumi, but only so-so in the grand scheme of things.

Verdict: Way better than last time.

We started off with the hamachi. The waitress tried to sell us on the hamachi special, which had some sort of BS peach-mango salsa on top. I didn't bite. Hamachi is a dish that's supposed to harness the power of the fish (tuna) with a subtle bit of heat from the jalapeno, so I wasn't sure what they were doing putting salsa on it. Anyways, it was good! The tuna was sliced nicely and decently fresh. The only thing I can compare it to is Nobu...so it fell way short in that aspect, but it was totally nommable.

We got a few rolls, too--spicy tuna, firecracker (some fish-laden monstrosity) and a king crab roll. The firecracker, which was deep-fried, was good. I think because some of the fish in it was cooked, I was a little off-put. My brother loved it, though, so props.

Spicy tuna was basic and run of the mill, and the king crab was pretty good. I like that they offer a choice of asparagus or avocado, mainly because I love asparagus and will always get it, even if it's not the norm.

Major gripe: The tomago. This is always the true measure of a good sushi chef. Red did NOT make theirs fresh. I saw the sushi \"chef\" unwrap it from plastic, make a slit in it, and stuff some rice in. That's a major no-no in my book. It should be made fresh with lots of layers and placed over rice...not served cold. Tsk tsk.

Regardless, Red Sushi was good. We spent about $25/pp with tip, which I thought (again) was pricey for what we got. This would've cost me about $40//pp at Sushi Taro in DC, but I wouldn't be complaining about the price.

Anyways, I'd probably go back for lunch. $$-wise, though? Eh."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. Noise/music awful. As I looked around the restaurant everyone looked like they were \"trying\" to have conversations over the beats. The restaurant should quit trying to create the rave sound of the 90s and take a tip from real Japanese restaurants in Osaka, Kyoto or Tokyo. There's GREAT modern Japanese music that would turn that place from ok to GREAT. Hope the new location fares better in regards to sound. Please oh please."}
{"text":"Mmmm...Sushi so good!!! This is my favorite in madison, all the time number 1. Drinks are on point. Recommend the tsunami roll, the vegan rainbow and garden smasher drink!  so good"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch and dinner, and we preferred lunch. Service and food wise. 

The sushi tastes great; none really stand out or disappoint either.

The grilled beef negimaki is probably one of my favorite appetizers. The steak is very tender and they use enough asparagus in a bunch to make it worth the $8. I'm not a huge fan of teriyaki, but it was very subtle so I didn't have to remove some of it off like I usually do.

The grilled chicken breast entree tastes better with korean bbq sauce. We ordered this dish for lunch and for dinner. Lunch had better taste and presentation. Dinner had the sauce on the side and the vegetables weren't even sliced in the usual bite size pieces. It's really annoying to spend time slicing your own squash and bell peppers. 

Otherwise, it's still a great place and we like it enough to come back and make it one of our regular sushi spots."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went dating on a weeknight to decompress after a busy and stressful last couple weeks. We decided on Red since we were pretty satisfied by Muramoto's other restaurant, Sushi Muramoto. 

The place was packed and reminded me of the intimate seating we came across in New York where the restaurant is long and narrow and seating communal in order to fit as many patrons as possible given the small space. 

Our neighbors were celebrating a birthday and taking pictures that I'm sure hubby and I were part of... Kinda impossible not to be given the seating style of one long bench along the wall and tables used as the only real separator of the space. When they sang the birthday song everyone in the restaurant clapped and sang along... We were all part of the celebration.

Red is the kind of place where you lean over the table to talk to each other and everyone knows what everyone next to them is talking about, and some become animated due to the feel of being on display.  Some sit quietly and listen to what everyone around them is discussing, hubby and I are usually the ones doing the talking.  

Our waitress was kind although clearly frazzled. It wasn't her usual night to work and she just couldn't quite get her head in the game, she couldn't keep up with the volume of people she was serving, but she made sure to keep all of us updated, remained honest about her mistakes - and did what she could to make up for it.

For example, she served us our neighbor's meal. Having never been to Red before nor ever trying what we ordered - we ate half of it before she realized.  We complimented our neighbors on their good taste in sushi and had ourselves a good chuckle. Our waitress compensated all of us by giving us all a full order of sushi to take home with us. 

Although sushi really isn't the kind of food known for being good leftover, she was given the full 20% tip for her class.  

The atmosphere was fun and hubby and I had a great evening. The sushi was ok but not great. Nothing stood out for me or really had either of us raving about the flavors. We were given quite a large amount of sushi and what we were sent home with had pretty much the same effect."}
{"text":"As far as sushi goes in Madison I think Red is probably the best, or at least the most well known/trendiest. The menu is pretty safe across the board and they don't really fumble any execution which is nice. My only complaints are the price and wait time are often high. Service sometimes is slow as a whole (not just food arrival but everything: greeting you, coming back for orders, checking in on you, etc). All food is good but toward the end of the night or on week days I occasionally get a fishier piece than I would expect for the price (I understand I am in Madison WI....)"}
{"text":"I went out to dinner with two friends at Red Sushi last night and was delighted to discover my new favorite sushi restaurant in Madison!

Some other reviewers mentioned the small size of Red Sushi, which became quite apparent during my visit. When we arrived around 6:30, the restaurant was full, but we were able to get a table on the outdoor patio. Although it was nice to get a table right away, the tables outside were also very close together and the chairs were made of uncomfortable plastic. I definitely would have preferred to be inside, but the food made up for the environment! 

We ordered the Firecracker, Orange Cracker and Super Volcano rolls. They were all very yummy and I would definitely order any of them again. The Firecracker roll was my favorite. The fried roll topped with soft spicy tuna had an amazing texture contrast that I was absolutely in love with! 

 My least favorite was the Super Volcano, I have loved this roll at other restaurants, but the cream cheese was so overpowering to the point that it was all I could taste in some bites. 

Despite the few slip ups, the sushi at Red Sushi was delicious and I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Innovative and lively.
Great setting, excellent service, knowledgeable staff. This is a cocktail for success.
The rolls where delightful with unusual ingredients."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant but nonetheless disappointing experience at Sushi Red. While enjoying our cocktails, we watched one of the chefs craft one meticulous, gorgeous roll after another. But when served, we realized that he was stationed there for a reason: to impress diners while less talented chefs assembled rolls to his right in a less visible spot. Our rolls tasted good but were sloppily made compared to other places in town like Takumi. The rolls were sliced unevenly so each piece varied significantly in size. The end pieces were tiny and didn't have any fish. Between those problems and the pulsating music, I'd probably opt for Takumi or Muramoto over Sushi Red."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh sushi. Fun and creative rolls, place was packed, we sit by the bar but our bartender gave us a great quick service"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. You can't go wrong, especially with their seasonal rolls! The tsunami is a personal favourite!"}
{"text":"RED is certainly my favorite sushi in Madison. I think it is very comparable to Muramoto, but it seems to be more creative. I have honestly liked every roll i have ever tried there, with 2 of my favorites being the Omega 6 roll and the Peking roll. 
My only complaint is that I think their shumai and gyoza could use a little bit of work, but they are still both tasty"}
{"text":"I am still on the hunt for a great sushi place in Madison. I was excited for Red and the flavor combos in the maki seemed interesting but none of the flavors came together for me.  Maybe I need to go back for a second round and try a few other things.  The use of sauces/mayo/tobiko, etc was way over the top and diluted any hope for simplicity and tradition."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch with friends and a toddler, after reading the reviews.

We knew that the sushi would be good and worth the wait when we saw the line during winter break on a weekday lunch hour.  The interior is beautiful, very lounge like and would be fun for a 30th birthday party location.  Hip, but not too hip.  Great menu overall, not the most kid friendly menu but we are used to that so we were able to make thing work.

Food was for sure 5 star.  Service 3 star.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We celebrated our year wedding anniversary here and it was incredible. I have never had sushi rolls so big and the sake menu was extensive. Our favorite upscale sushi spot in Madison."}
{"text":"Hands down one of, if not the best Sushi in Madison. Always FRESH.

Call for reservations on the weekends or you are looking at an hr+ wait."}
{"text":"This is excellent ambience service. Food is great value and well made, first sushi experience in Madison definitely blew my expectations, and this is coming from NYC!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner here yesterday usually there is 20-45min wait (which is not a negative, just a fact),and  we got the same waitress we did as last time. She is alright, comes off more like a car sales person than a waitress, a bit \"pushy\". But the food was good last time , so we wanted to try again. Couple of things happened which disappointed. 

1 - a Japanese restaurant , they don't seem to give enough Wasabi, when you ask for more , they actually charge for it. This happened in both our visits, first time we wrote it off thinking \"no big deal\". 

2 - There was no soy sauce at our table when we got our food. When we tried to ask for it, we had wait, while our food was sitting at the table. Waitress response after the delay was \"do you like low sodium or regular?\" No hint of apology or regret it wasn't there already. 

Overall, I would say the food is good, but I would debate going there again, just cause the service isn't that great."}
{"text":"It was good, nothing incredible but satisfying. My only gripes are that the service was a little slow and the oysters weren't the freshest. The miso soup was good and the Red Roll was the highlight. Decent portion size was appreciated."}
{"text":"5* menu and service by our server Malina.

Crowded and loud between 12 PM and 12:30; quieted down a lot at 1 PM.  

Crowded sushi restaurant is always a good sign, so I'm glad we waited for a table.

Excellent kale salad with tasty vinaigrette; I was skeptical about the kale but II ended up licking the plate.

I highly recommend the hamachi avocado green onion roll to those who enjoy traditional Japanese style sushi without the sauces.  The vegan roll I didn't care for as much, since it surprised me by coming drizzled with a sauce (the sauce was quite good, though, and there wasn't too much of it).

Skip the vegan cheesecake. It was really bad. I took 2 bites and left the rest. Vegan cheesecake is usually either really good or really bad."}
{"text":"The sushi was okay, I have definitely had better. The rolls were not tightly wrapped but, overall the taste was okay. I was disappointed with the service. I'm in Wisconsin on business and traveling alone. I sat at the sushi bar, was never greeted. Three college students sat down after me, were greeted and their orders taken immediately. About 25 minutes later the guy taking the orders asked me if I had any questions. My main question was...why did I decide to wait??!!  Hunger, I guess. I got my sushi to go, I had two rolls and seaweed salad, it was about $35.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This is my third time to Red and the second time at the new location. Although I live in Chicago I am in Madison on most weekends, so I don't eat here as often as I would like. I would give the food a 5 star, service a 3 star and bar a 2 star and here is why.
Food is really great, I have never ordered anything that was disappointing and continue to try new items. Seaweed Salad with cucumbers was my new favorite this trip.
Service ... clearly they were busy, however learn to not swamp the servers. Just because a table is open doesn't mean you should seat guests if the service is going to be spotty. We were seated in the bar and our waiter had tables in the restaurant and only our table in the bar. After being seated we waited at least 15 minutes before our order was taken. Our sushi (3 rolls and 4 pieces) arrived 3 minutes before our appetizers. So here is our small 2 top table with sushi already served and then our salads show up. Strange and not really acceptable. Although our server was friendly and professional the restaurant did not help set him up for success.
Bar ... clearly slammed! Disappointed that they don't have beer in tap, but I can get past that. We ordered Soporro and it was room temperature at best, the next one we asked to have on ice before we opened and after 15 minutes on ice (without a beverage) it was still only moderately better. 
All of the issues that I had are all fixable, which is why I am giving this a 4 star ... now if I go back and I experience these issues again, well then that's another story."}
{"text":"I came with some friends on a beautiful night and throughly enjoyed their outdoor seating area. 

The Sushi was spectacular. Being a sushi novice, I didn't order but happily ate all that we tried. The eel and the soft shell crab were among my favorites. It was so delicious that I now seek it out! Our server was attentive and accomodating of our desire to try several things. 

The inside of the restaurant was clean and beautiful. The bathrooms were also clean and lovely.

The only reason that I couldn't give  5 stars was because of the way we were asked to leave. We were enjoying ourselves and apparently lingered longer than they allowed. We were unaware of this as our server kept refilling our waters and never picked up the final check. They rudely asked us to leave stating others were waiting for the table. While I understand the need to turn tables to make a profit, there was a kinder, more tactful way to approach the situation."}
{"text":"I've been a couple times, and have had OK food and drink. When I found out about the vegan roll, I was really excited about it and ordered it the first chance I got. Sadly, the roll was an utter disappointment.  The forbidden rice was extremely dry, and they didn't season the vegetables at all (not even salt or pepper on the avocado). I felt like there was very little effort, thought, or love put into the roll. It also took them 25 minutes to prepare it, which I felt was insane, considering it wasn't busy at all when I picked up my order."}
{"text":"The Good: The variety on the menu is outstanding. I ordered the Candy Apple (a special) that included tuna and fruit amongst other unique flavors. The entire menu is delicious and includes a good balance of classics and exciting options. 

The Not So Good: You can ONLY make reservations for parties of four. Not five. Not six. Four. This is not the best strategy for a restaurant that is impossible to get a table at during normal dinner hours. 

The Highlight: Order the crispy tuna rice appetizer. Our table agreed: this is too good to split!"}
{"text":"The best sushi, ever. They keep an ever changing seasonal menu available for the adventurous type, featuring very unique creations with great flavors! They often offer black rice for a more nutty taste and rich antioxidant properties- it is delicious and well worth the upgrade. Also delicious is the soy paper rolls, rather than seaweed. They also have a great vegan menu!! I recommend the vegan rainbow. As for sushi and sashimi, their bluefin tuna and tuna belly are well worth the price- so soft and flavorful. Favorite cooked rolls are spider and sea god, and favorite raw rolls are triple decker, omega 3, badger, tiger, and purple rain. If you haven't been here yet, YOU NEED TO GO!!"}
{"text":"We really should write two reviews for Red. Midwest Sushi and sushi for those who are used to it elsewhere. As Midwest Sushi goes it was pretty good. Good selection on the menu, sparingly used mayo, and decent selection of sake. If you are used to gas station sushi this will be a decent improvement. Service was good, place is trendy, and it is a nicer visit for Madison.

If you are used to actual seaweed salad, rolls where the fish/eel/etc. is the flavour center, and a sake menu with more than a few choices...this isn't it. We were taken aback by yellowtail sashimi having soy sauce, jalapenos, and roe fish eggs????

Overall if we had a hankering for sushi in Madison we'd go back. We will just need to accept this is midwest sushi and march on."}
{"text":"One day just stopped by for a quick meal. 

I've came here several times before and always had a good impression. The food is fusion-style, so if you want to try authentic Japanese sushi, go to muramoto. But I like how the cook treated food and always come up with new dishes. And they taste good - except their miso soup, which taste like salted water -- too much salts! 
The servers were generally polite, and especially the girls at the front desk, who tried their best let to let people wait for too long. But I have to say that single day I had an awkward experience with a server. I waited for at least half an hour or even more to get my sushi - it's just one simple dish, even if the restaurant was not so busy when I was waiting. I felt that people coming in groups were treated prior to me and people who came later than me all got their food. So I asked another server who just passed by - the original one just never showed up again - if my dish is ready. He went to kitchen to check and came back and told me: \"They didn't do it yet.\" I said: \"Ok, I will cancel my order.\" and stood up to leave. Then I was stopped by my original server who told me that the food was ready. I told him what was going on just now and he didn't want to apologize. 
Although the food eventually came, I was not satisfied at all and couldn't really enjoy it anymore. That was my last time stopping by."}
{"text":"Now I've only my been here once but it was amazing. Best sushi in Madison and surrounding areas the raw fish actually tasted like it was suppose to. Clearly this place knows what they are doing. The service was really good and our waitress was really cool. They even check your coat like I love this! I can't wait to come back and try more! Lobster tempura roll with the spicy tuna on top is most amazing thing we tried tonight. The raw sushi I had tasted so fresh and tasted like the fish it was! Another highlight was the spicy tuna on crispy rice. Lots to try I'll be back! Interesting decor lots to look at !"}
{"text":"Quality sushi! If you are a sushi lover definitely go to this place instead of other restaurants on State St because my friend, you deserve to have good sushi. I would recommend reserving a table if you plan to go because people love it and it is very crowded. Besides sushi, the foie gras is absolutely amazing too, which is a bit odd because it is a French dish but it was good so I was happy"}
{"text":"This is the best place for sushi in Madison! The inside of the restaurant has a very authentic feel. There is always a long wait for a table, due to the size of the place, but sitting at the bar is fine with me because watching the chefs prepare the food & drinks is amazing! I recently discovered that they do take-out orders and the wait is never for pick up. Whenever I am craving sushi this is my must-go-to place in Madison."}
{"text":"Went to red sushi the other night and had a wonderful experience. The decor of the restaurant is very modern and gives a romantic feel. The service was very good, she could have been a little bit more friendly but it was good service.  I had the Atlantic  roll and the orange crunch roll, both very good. The Atlantic roll was my favorite. Will definitely be making my way back to red soon!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group from work at lunch. 

Food was pretty good, but server not so nice. He messed up one little thing and one big thing. He did knock off some other items from the group's bill to make up for it (luckily we didn't absolutely need separate checks!), and just seemed to have a general \"I just can't care anymore\" kind of disposition. We didn't do anything to deserve it, but luckily, everyone approved of the quality of the food. Atmosphere is pretty nice, too."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have ever had in my entire life. No other restaurant in madison can compare. Their menu choices are vast and unique. The fish and vegetables are extremely fresh and you can taste the difference between other places in town. I also love the atmosphere it is small but it gives gives it an intimate,  exclusive vibe. If I could afford it I would eat here weekly!! I recommend the mermaid roll and any vegan/vegetable roll on the menu is great."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my sushi. I got the Tropica roll(spicy tuna and mango). It had great flavor and was very enjoyable. However the sushi was slightly sloppy. I know this is just a presentation, but was falling apart in my chopsticks.

I will be going back. Great Service too!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Hands down one of the nicer places I've eaten sushi in! Their selection was outstanding and everything was fresh and delicious! Great bartender and quick with our food. Very welcoming too!"}
{"text":"Everything was outstanding including the sea urchin, quail egg, champagne and hot sauce shooter.  The staff was very engaging and up beat. The sushi was great as we ordered 4 regular rolls and one signature roll.  Definitely fresh as can be ingredients as if they caught the sea creatures that day."}
{"text":"The sushi and rolls are very good.  I come to Madison for work and have been here 3 times over as many trips to this city.  The food is far better than the service - which may be a function of their popularity (every time I've gone it's busy).  If you don't mind less than average service you'll like Red!  (By the way I always sit at the bar, where you'd think the service would be pretty good - NO.). 4 stars - food. 2 stars - service."}
{"text":"who doesn't love sake? and sashimi? 

wound up here by accident with a couple of coworkers after we got dinner down the street. Drinks were good so i decided to come back for the sushi a few days later. I've had sushi from the west coast and sushi from the east coast and this is the best I've had in madison. Its a bit on the pricey side but for what you get its worth it."}
{"text":"Red makes outstanding sushi, best I've had in Madison.  There are quite a few exotic rolls, many of which were invented by the owner.  But I'm a traditionalist.  When I try a new sushi place I stick with the nigiri and a bowl of miso soup.  If the chef can make good nigiri, then I know the rest of the menu will be good.

And that was some damn good nigiri...  The fish was super-fresh, each piece topped with a tiny dollop of roe and a tiny piece of green.  The presentation was exquisite and looked as good as it tasted.  I had the bluefin tuna, yellowtail, raw salmon and eel.  Each piece was a delicate treat.  My only disappointment was that they were out of fatty tuna (bluefin belly) which is a real treat when you can find it.

The only reason I didn't give the restaurant the full 5 stars was the rather indifferent service we received.  Our server was inattentive and more interested in chatting with the expediter behind the pass-through than in offering 5 star service.  

I'm also not a fan of servers at the sushi bar bringing the sushi.  The reason I sit at the bar is that I want to interact with the sushi chefs directly and let them tell me what's fresh, what they like and what I should try.  I don't need a server to proxy that for me.  So I hope Red changes this policy to allow the patrons at the sushi bar to deal directly with the sushi chefs.

One thing of note, there IS a chef's table offering for $100/person which allows patrons to interact directly with the owner/chef at the sushi bar.  I think I will try that next time to get the full sushi bar experience.

Overall, an excellent sushi restaurant with chefs who've mastered the subtle art of sushi and sashimi.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I went here with a friend after some Christmas shopping on State Street. We ordered four rolls to try out: Negihama, Dragonroll, Peking, and Salmon Lover. All of them were good, but my favorites were the Negihama and Dragonroll. 

Negihama is yellowtail and green onion and was the plainest of the rolls we had; however, it the fish was very flavorful and simplicity of the roll really brought out that taste. The dragonroll was also good. The tempura shrimp they used in it was fresh and crunchy. The salmon was also pretty fresh and had a very creamy texture -- just right! As for the peking roll, it is something I've never had anywhere else! It features duck as the main meat and is accompanied by lettuce, avocado, mango, and eel sauce. I also looked at other items in the menu and they have a bunch of other more creative rolls. I'd definitely be interested in trying those out as well.

In terms of service, I thought they did an excellent job. Right when we got in the hostess was very polite and asked us whether we had any shows to go to after she seated us. Our waitress was also really nice and came back to check up on us regularly.

So in summary, good food, good service."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on July 6th - the sushi was great and Jack the chef seemed really knowledgable on the cuts of meat and the marbling of the meat and texture.  Enjoyed the sushi and will definitely be back for a date night here."}
{"text":"I can't go to any other sushi restaurants in Madison after my experiences at Red!  The food quality and presentation are a league above anywhere else in town.  I've been looking for Toro (belly tuna) for years and while it is on the menu at every sushi restaurant, others are always out of it. I went to a work dinner at Red last week and we all enjoyed an overflowing spoon of toro and it was delicious!  The chefs' presentation is creative and careful and every dish is as delicious as it looks.  I'm not a dessert person but their blueberry lemon cheesecake is a must.  Try the lychee martini too.  Finally their new space is amazing, a hip but welcoming atmosphere and an awesome outdoor patio; it feels like every table is the best seat in the house."}
{"text":"I wrote a previous review giving them three stars, mainly based on bad service. However, I've since been back, and my subsequent experiences have been great, including the food and the service. Last time I was there, it was my partner's birthday, and they brought us an extra avocado roll and lit a candle for them as a surprise! I also LOVE that they keep updating (and improving!) their vegan menu. Although I do miss the old tofu dish, the new one with the peanut noodles is also to die for, and the specialty vegan rolls are always very interesting. It's a little pricy so it's definitely for special occasions, but I plan to continue going back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison hands down!! They have awesome rolls which are unique and delicious. They have some with steak as well which is super cool! I've never had a bad experience there. The ambience is classy and cool. A great date night restaurant! 

I've eaten here many times and only once have they messed up our order to which they gave us the wrong roll. We didn't even notice and ate it, but later our waiter returned to tell us and brought or correct roll out! They have both rolls to us for free it was awesome service! 

I would recommend this place to anyone. Favorite restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Had heard about this restaurant while at another sushi place and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the seafood.  The place does resemble a dive bar, but is clean and service is quick.  The wait staff was disorganized, but in their defense it was right as they opened.  Try the $12 sushi lunch, worth every penny.  My new favorite place for sushi in Madison."}
{"text":"I visited Red Sushi for lunch while at a convention at Monona Terrace, I was glad to be just a single person because, as previous reviews have stated, the atmosphere is nice but space is limited. 
The prices are reasonable and proportions are generous. I glanced at the drink menu and it seems to be expansive with a nice selection of domestic and imported beers. I ordered the spicy salmon tempura roll and a traditional California roll. The spicy salmon was good, however the crab in the cali roll did not have a fresh taste and was somewhat rubbery.  Based on the other reviews I read about Red Sushi, I was expecting to have amazing sushi, but the food I had was about the same quality as the \"fresh\" packaged sushi at Beyerly's or Lund's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi in Madison. They serve a wide range of options to change up the sushi experience-- several riceless roll options, forbidden rice, and vegetarian rolls. The fish is always delicious and fresh tasting; sashimi is never a disappointment.

I love the specialty rolls, but a good alaskan roll with forbidden rice always hits the spot because they are so well prepared and fresh. The drinks and appetizers are also must-trys

They make up for the small space with good service and great food!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed in the size of the sushi rolls for the price. After eating 2 rolls, I was still hungry. I've had quite a bit of sushi in my lifetime from different restaurants but this was nothing special."}
{"text":"The new Red Lounge decor is great! I love the private dining room, and the modern feel to it.

I recommend the Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice to start! Jalapeño is a nice kick and the rice is so good! Although I think the pieces are to big for bite size. It's hard to get it all in one bite! Maybe more pieces smaller size? Currently plate has 5 pieces.

Main dishes I recommend the carpaccio, scallops, and most of all the Foie Gras! Such delicious flavors!

Sushi orders: the mermaid roll is fruity and fresh. I also like the super volcano.

Dessert: Blueberry Creme brûlée is so yummy with a great top layer!

Overall service was great but when our rolls were served they didn't say which one was which. Only thing that threw me off."}
{"text":"This should be called the best First Date Sushi Joint in Madison.  Great, fresh sushi, excellent spicy ramen, fun cocktails, beautiful decor, chill house music that's not too loud, and fast service. Even if you're on the fence about sushi you should go."}
{"text":"We still love Red Sushi and still find it to be the best sushi in town. Especially if you love to try unique spins on different types of rolls! 
Enjoyed our most recent dinning experience here. Only complaint is how crowded and compact you feel and maybe the noise level but these things will not keep us away. 
AMAZING SUSHI!"}
{"text":"The real deal. Sushi is excellent. Fresh, great cuts, right size, and the rice is above average. 

I recommend the hand rolls. Sake menu is good and reasonable. 

Place is small but they pump the sushi out. Music and lighting work well. Energy works. 

Glad to finally have a true sushi place in town."}
{"text":"I love this place- i've gone for dinner and lunch- I think it is reasonably priced (as compared to other Madison sushi places).  The rolls are tasty, fresh and unique.  This location has gone through many restaurants in the past  few years - i really hope Red Sushi is here to stay- the Capital area needs a hip, delicious and affordable sushi place."}
{"text":"Quite solid menu. Probably the most consistent sushi place in town. Got the sushi & sashimi chef's choice combo, and it was really high quality. 

Be advised it's a smaller restaurant so there is a great chance you will have to wait for a table on any given night."}
{"text":"Really solid sushi restaurant, and in my opinion, the best in Madison. They definitely cater to the people that want specialty roles, which is me! 

My favorites are spicy scallop and the dragon, personally, but they are always switching out seasonal roles. 

I'd also recommend the red slaw app, it s big and super delicious! A perfect prep sushi appetizer to share for two. 

I think they take rez for parties over 4, but not sure. It does get really crowded on the weekend nights."}
{"text":"The new location is great and the space was done up very well! They've updated the menu and cocktail list with new options. Sadly though, they have taken away my favorite app - the Red Slaw. I know others have mentioned that to me too and we are all pretty disappointed. 

Other than that, the quality and service is same as at the old location. Make a reservation early or be prepared for a long wait though. I usually have to wait 1 - 1.5 hours whenever I walk in no matter the day."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Red Sushi, but be assured, it certainly won't be my last. It was a beautiful Friday night so my friend and I decided to eat outside (well, that along with the fact that it was far too busy for them to seat us inside). But it worked out well as it was much quieter outside even with the concert on King St. Jimmy was our server and we LOVE him! The martinis were delightful. I can't remember the name of my favorite one right now, but I think it was possibly the French word for umbrella, if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, it was crazy good - I hope to have it again sometime.
I ordered 2 rolls:  the Firecracker and the Omega 3. OMG, you guys! Incredible sushi experience!!!!! They are specialty rolls so they are a bit more expensive ($13-$15), but you really do get what you pay for - high quality for sure! My friend had a few vegetarian rolls that she really enjoyed and for dessert we shared the chocolate mousse which was juuuust the right amount of sweet for our post-sushi euphoria.
Our only complaint was that the outside tables posed a bit of a challenge/frustration for us sandal-wearing girls. They don't use table clothes and there are cut-outs in the tables for the soy sauce to sneak through so we had sticky toes/shoes in the end, however, Jimmy brought over a warm, damp cloth so I could clean up before leaving.
Red is not a place I would be able to afford to go to regularly, but for a special occasion or a hard-core sushi craving, that's where you'll find me."}

Uniqueness: 5

-----------------------------------------------

Red Sushi has definitely become the best option for sushi in Madison!

The freshness of the fish is excellent and the creativity behind their rolls makes them unique not just for Madison, but for sushi experiences in general.

My wife and I headed hear for a bite before a show at the Majestic theater across the street and I was ecstatic to find a wide assortment of unique rolls on the menu. The Orange Crunch, Salmon Lover, and Firecracker rolls are inventive rolls I just haven't experienced the likes of elsewhere. The fish was really fresh and the unique sauces that accompanied them made for a really memorable experience.

The service is also very solid with friendly wait staff who have clearly tried the stuff on the menu before offering suggestions.

Definitely a must try place in a great location downtown!"}
{"text":"You know that sinking feeling when you're waiting for your food and you see other people order...their food comes...they eat it...and leave?  

Had the joy of experiencing this multiple times at RED.

The ridiculous wait of maybe 1.5 hrs for food (this was while seated, not waiting for a table) was on a quiet weekday night for 2 people.

We ordered some rolls and sashimi.  And waited. And waited.  We would make desperate eye contact with the server, but nada. At some point, we got a response like \"Oh, they lost your order, it was sent back\" \"it's a good thing you two are so in LOVE while you've been waiting such a long time!\" 

Lady, being in love doesn't stop you from being ravenous and irritated while other tables arrived later and left before we got our food.

There was a vague offer to bring a beverage or edamame, but no clear offer that it would be gratis or whether the appetizer would even make its way to us.

Eventually, the food came to our table. I vaguely remember it tasting fine, but we were so hungry, a day old McRib probably would have tasted pretty good.

Oh, and we were late for the thing we had scheduled after dinner.

Bah humbug."}
{"text":"Red is my favorite spot-hands down-for sushi in Madison.  Don't even try to tell me otherwise as #1) I won't listen and #2) You are wrong.

Over the past couple years, I probably have tried almost everything on their sushi menu.  2 of my favorites are the Amigo Roll-yellowtail, green onion, jalapeno, avocado and the Mermaid Roll-shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado, pickled jalapeno, mango, strawberries, kiwi sauce.  But quite honestly, you can't go wrong with whatever you order.  Along with their great sushi, Red delivers on cocktails as well.  

The interior is modern and seating can be tight but I honestly believes this adds to the experience.  Service is always solid.

If you haven't tried it yet, go!  Thank me later.

TIP:  It can get pretty busy so for parties of 4 or more, you can call for reservations."}
{"text":"The best in Madison, hands down.  True, the competition here is not as tough as it is in larger cities but the quality of their sushi and their presentation is top notch.  The new space is sleek and sophisticated and has a great vibe and energy to it.  At times, service can be rather clunky but I am willing to overlook this as I nosh on my favorite roll, the Amigo. Along with the Amigo, my better half and I usually order the sushi and sashimi dinner.  7 pieces of sushi, another 7 of sashimi and a tekka roll.  Provides a good sampling of fish choices and a solid value at $32."}
{"text":"This place is pretty on par with Muramoto. Their specality rolls are much better, but the generic rolls seem to be a touch worse.

I came in here with a large group. This place is quite small so there was an hour wait. They take your name and number and text you with your wait time and a link to their wait list. They even call you when your table is ready. This was an incredibly nice touch for me as I only live a block away and my large group could pass time at my apartment instead of trying to get a seating at a bar at 8PM on a Saturday. 

The place didn't sit a large group well, but we managed and our waitress juggled it nicely. It would be a much better place for a party of 4 or less.

My group ordered quite a lot and it all came out quickly. Overall we were very satisfied. My main issues were with the cuttlefish and octopus. They're both easily messed up dishes so I'm not holding it against them too much. I just really wish I could find a place in town that does octopus sashimi well.

My go to, unagi, was fairly average and I much prefer Muramoto's. The seasonal roll I got, I forget the name of it, was amazing though. I also had a lychee berry martini which was almost my favorite part of the meal, hah. It was quite good and was even garnished with a lychee berry.

I'll definitely be coming back here for their seasonals, but I'll stick with Muramoto for my favorite rolls."}
{"text":"Had sushi at the King street location quite a few times, assuming it is the same deal now that they moved.  If I am going to have sushi in Madison, this is the place I am likely to be going.  I have tried a number of other Madison locations and they are all 3 stars at best."}
{"text":"I love sushi, I love fine dining, and I love going out for a delicious roll of sushi. I enjoyed my dinner at red sushi but the spotty service and poor environment had me wanting something different.

Red sushi is in a convenient location right off the capitol; parking is numerous but also difficult to find if looking past 6pm. I came here with a party of 12, seated close to the door and the bar. It was extremely cramped, crowded, and loud. However, the server did take our drink orders right away. I had the house warm sake, which was served pretty quickly.

For main course, I ordered the spicy salmon and avocado and spicy tuna salad. Spicy salmon was delicious (a very standard sushi roll). Salad was forgettable, but had a tasty vinegar punch. We asked for a few side items (such as sauces and drinks) which were often forgotten, and we had to remind different servers. We all enjoyed our meal, but I did not enjoy the environment one bit. Again, too crowded and really too loud. We found ourselves moving and changing seats in order to converse with people only a few chairs away. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here. I would come back with one or two people, but definitely not again with a large group."}
{"text":"We were in Madison for one night, and went to this sushi restaurant from the recommendation of a bartender where we had lunch. This place is amazing. We had the Godzilla roll, Alaska roll, spicy tuna, amigo and a seasonal roll called the butterfly. We assumed the Alaska roll and the spicy tuna roll would be smaller (which at previous sushi spits they have been) we were wrong! Every roll had a lot of fish and they were big! Not to mention delicious. The amigo roll was my favorite and the spicy Godzilla was my husbands favorite. Great service, great sushi, and we were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the pricing was. Best sushi bang for your buck. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!  Tastes very fresh and presentation is top notch.  Always crave this place."}
{"text":"Great place for a light lunch - good sushi, reasonable lunch special pricing, friendly service and trendy atmosphere.

Came here for lunch a few days ago with some family members who are vegetarians and really like the place.  We all ordered the $15 lunch special which gets you two rolls. We also had some edamame and miso soup, both of which were wonderful.

The rolls were made inside-out, which is very pretty and holds sauce well.  My salmon skin rolls had a nice texture, the salmon skin was very crunchy which I like, but was in very small pieces like crumbles which tended to fall apart after dipping in soy sauce.  The tuna/avocado rolls were excellent.

The vegetarians had some beautiful-looking rolls made with sweet peppers - very colorful.

The service was very attentive, and our food was prepared quite quickly.  The atmosphere was very modern and clean in appearance.  I'd definitely come back, particularly for the lunch special which is just enough at noon."}
{"text":"Always a hit every time

Seafood is always fresh, service is great, drinks are great and the atmosphere makes you feel young!

Keep it up Red!"}
{"text":"OMG just went to the new location. It is even better! Loved it, my good friend was in ecstasy over the seasonal sushi rolls. And our waitress was really helpful and sweet. 

Previous review:

I went to Madison for college and live in San Francisco. Visiting Madison a friend said I have to check out Red Sushi. I love sushi and was curious. Now I know why my friend recommended it. Red sushi is by far the best sushi place in Madison. It is creative, high quality and and great for dates. The service cares and the experience was just as good if not better than back home."}
{"text":"Every bite was amazing. Haters stop hating. This place is wonderful. Come here and get the best sushi around. I wouldn't lie."}
{"text":"There was a piece of hair in my sea weed salad...yuck. The servers were overwhelmed at 1:00 and we had trouble attaining a fork for our younger companion. This is the 2nd time I have been disappointed by Red and will not be returning. :-("}
{"text":"I don't know what rating to give to this place to be honest. 

I really enjoyed the food. The rice was cooked well, it wasn't gummy or hard. It was seasoned just right. The fish was fresh, lacking in any odor as far as I can tell, and were delicious. However, the size of the sushi pieces themselves were so tiny. About half the size of what you would get at other sushi restaurant but double the price. It was a size of sushi you would expect you local cheap Chinese buffet, but with better rice and better seafood.  I wouldn't mind the price so much if I actually got a full size piece. It's looks like a cost cutting measure to me, since red sushi moved from its more hole in the wall type of atmosphere to its current hip-looking establishment on the other side of the square. Which brings to me my biggest complaint about this place.

It's just so... douchey now. Between the decor, the perfumed air, the club music, and the lit up bar, I wasn't sure my drink would be actually liquid or some weird gatro-drink ala Parks and Rec. To be fair, the drink that I got was very good.

It seems to me that Red is stuck in a place between being a hip bar, and a good sushi restaurant. Too afraid to commit to being really good in one or the other.

It's such a shame, red sushi used to be my favorite hole in the wall sushi place with amazing food. Now it feels like it belongs in the viagra valley in Chicago."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive at first as this is not one of my normal sushi places as I am rather picky with my sushi, but decided to try it anyways based on the reviews on here. The location is great but the space is super small (they are moving locations soon). We ordered some appetizers and drinks. Both apps and drinks were tasty. If you are a wino, I would highly recommend the plum wine (it's a sweet wine). With 5 of us at our table we decided to order two rolls each and share. I ordered the super volcano roll as well Adobe other roll. The volcano roll was absolutely phenomenal! If you like sushi and want a place to try, I would highly recommend this place. I only marked it down because of the space. Once it moves, I would probably rate it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Love Red Sushi! I've eaten here too many times to count and this place has coverted many non sushi eaters into believers. They always get alot of options that i cannot seem to find in other sushi restaurants around Madison. The sushi rice has an amazing texture and taste that i cannot get enough of."}
{"text":"I am a sushi lover. I lived in NYC for almost a decade and had as many different varieties of sushi as is possible (the good, the bad and the ugly). Red Sushi ranks up with some of my all time favorite Sushi restaurants EVER. I love the huge variety and creativity of their offering, though they also have the old standards if you aren't feeling particularly adventurous. They even offer cooked sushi rolls and rice-less sushi rolls (which are amazing). The drinks are good, the place is cozy and warm, and the staff is really friendly. I love sitting at the bar and watching them make the sushi too. HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"I do not like fish. I do not like other seafood. Sushi and I generally do not get along. Red, though, has rolls that appeal to my sea-creature-averse self. My go-tos are the chicken tempura roll and the veggie tempura roll. Fresh, crunchy, and more food than I can comfortably take down in an average sitting. 

When I've dined in at Red, my experience has always been fantastic - the servers are funny and knowledgable, the service attentive without being cloying, and the rolls have come out in a  reasonable amount of time in proportion to our table size. I would happily dine in again (and again). My to-go experiences have been less successful, with my last visit convincing me I should avoid ordering takeout from them ever again. 

We came in around 5:30 on a Friday, and the restaurant was packed. When we arrived I gave the host my name and number of people in our party (3), and we were told it would be a 45-60 minute wait for seating. Red is a tiny, tiny place and there is nowhere to wait. It was chilly and pouring outside, so kicking it on the curb wasn't really an option. One of us had yet to arrive, so I asked if we could see a menu in case we decided to place a to-go order instead. Our third arrived eventually and didn't care if we waited, so we decided that since it had already been 15-20 minutes since we put our name in we might as well just get a table. Shortly after, the hostess came over to ask if we wanted to be put on the list or not. She said three more parties had now gotten in ahead of us, so we should decide. Cooool. My friend and I had both thought we were on the list from our initial exchange/not putting in a to-go order, but that wasn't the case. We didn't feel like waiting another hour, so we decided to just get it to go. 

In the past, when I've called in an order it's taken 20 minutes before we could pick it up. As we stood there waiting, we saw person after person stopping in to pick up their food. After 45 minutes of waiting since we put in our order, I inquired about our food. The host told us that she had no way of knowing when our order would be up. That seemed a little ridiculous to me - most kitchens have some sort of organization system, even if she couldn't estimate time there had to be a way to check how many orders were ahead of us. Finally, an hour after ordering and about 90 minutes after setting foot in the door and being jostled to death by all the people entering and exiting, we had our food. It was fine, but not up to the standard I've come to expect. 

I'd happily come dine in again, but Red might do well to improve communication among staff and to their guests. If we had known it'd take double the time to order takeout, we'd have just gotten a table. Or, if they'd let us know it was going to be awhile, they could have given us an estimate and we would have gone down a door or two for a drink while we waited. *shrug* Oh well. Also, for their own sake, a little organization would benefit them - when our food finally did come up, the host handed it to us and told us to have a great night without having ever given us the check. We're honest, so we asked for it, but we easily could have bounced with $50+ of food. Looking forward to my next dine-in trip to erase this night from my memory."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout only at their new location. I am a weirdo and don't like fish/seafood and Red hands down has the best and most interesting veggie sushi options. I am a sucker for their veggie tempura roll and have ordered for takeout twice since they resumed their takeout operation in the new space. 

You can order takeout on their website, choose whether you want your order ASAP or at a specific time, and pay on the site so you don't have to mess with signing for your order when you stop in to pick it up. 

Picking up has been easy both times; I've just let the hosts at the desk in the entryway know I'm picking up, stepped to the small seating area across from the desk, and been delivered a bag and offered chop sticks and soy sauce. Easy peasy!

The sushi itself has been wonderful - tight rolls, perfect texture on the veggies, fresh tasting, and filling. For me, one veggie roll isn't quite enough, and two is a bit too much. At $6 per roll, though, it's a steal and I can eat the leftovers the next day since veggies have no problem making it to the next day in the fridge. 

Two notes:
1) handles on the takeout bags would be helpful for the hike home, and
2) there appeared to be mayo inside the rolls of my most recent order; the veggie roll has never had mayo that I've noticed and I prefer it that way. Between their old and new locations I've had the veggie tempura roll at least ten times so I'm curious if it's a new addition or an accidental inclusion."}
{"text":"Just an awesome restaurant. Service was great and ambiance was nice. Definitely recommend their California rolls as well as their salmon."}
{"text":"Delicious all around. We shared multiple rolls and everyone was happy. Surprising that a land locked city can have such fresh fish."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great vibe. Great Service.

Eaten here dozens of times and always left more then satisfied. Reasonably priced too!

Bonus is that every beautiful girl in the city seems to eat here on a daily basis too ;-)"}
{"text":"When I arrived in Madison, my third stop (after getting my bagel and pizza affairs in order) was cheap, vegetarian sushi. I knew Red Sushi wouldn't be that place, but I would have been willing to splurge had the quality been there. We sat outside on what would likely be their last day of outdoor seating for the season. Service was a little slow, I imagine for that--wouldn't sit outside again. Prices were slightly high for the quality, and the sushi was average. I didn't have a standout roll. I'm still looking for my sweet spot in Madison."}
{"text":"New Location Makes it Best Restaurant in City. Not Just Sushi.

I've been going to RED for 4.5 years, and always enjoyed it. The food is great, and it is always a lively place to unwind with friends. They've built their success on consistent, creative food + a fun atmosphere that caters to those interested in an upbeat night.

Last week, RED moved into totally new digs at the freshly renovated AT&T building on W. Washington. I've already been there twice since they opened, and can officially report its the best restaurant in the city now. The atmosphere is totally unique -barely a straight line in the entire interior design. Bold artwork, modern touch throughout, excellent music and lighting.

The new RED has an open lounge, which is perfect for a pre-dinner drink before the main event: dinner in the dining room. All of the good from old RED got transported to the new RED, plus a whole lot more.

They've also added a whole line of new menu items with their recent hire of Executive Chef Jed Spink. Jed engineered a new line of non-sushi items like a.) pork belly & scallops, b.) wagyu beef tartare, and c.) grilled grass-fed ribeye, to name a few. If you don't like sushi, but are stuck going out for sushi with everyone else that loves sushi ... new RED has you covered. By the way, those are my favorite items on the menu, plus my go-to roll...\"The Dragon.\"

They also have added a private dining room that can seat up to 12 people. Would be perfect for larger get togethers with friends, business meetings or a special party. I think they found the right balance between privacy, but still feeling like you're part of the action in the greater restaurant area...where most people are eating.

Try it once, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Red is easily the best sushi restaurant I've eaten at in the mid-west. Whether you opt for a specialty roll, nigiri, or sashimi you will not be disappointed. Tonight I dined there with a group of friends, and as we planned to share our rolls, we asked the wait staff to just put them all together in the middle of our table. Not only did they do that, but the rolls and sashimi were so beautifully arranged that we almost felt bad about eating them.

The cocktails, which I've been told rotate, were also a delight. Tonight I had the Emperor's Delight (a bourbon and sake mixture), and some type of divine ginger concoction that was good enough to merit a return trip all by itself. For desert, my table split between the boring vanilla creme brûlée, and the Earl Grey creme brûlée. Both were superb, but if they have it you should really try the Earl Grey: It just works.

Great food, top notch mixed drinks, and superior service lead me to believe I will end up enjoying Red for many visits to come."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Beats muramoto out by a bit. But crowded. Fun to sit at bar; can see the chefs make your sushi and the bartenders make your cocktails. Speaking of-- both are delicious. You'll pay for it, but its worth it!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, some of the best sushi I have had, and I've had sushi all over the country. Red, from the decor to the food, stands shoulder to shoulder with anything you can find in Vegas. And I've been to a lot of sushi places in Vegas! From the creative sushi rolls to the awesome addition of the new chef for the large plates, this checks all the boxes. Throw in a great bar program with seasonal drinks, and this is the place to go. Everything from lunch to the best \"impress your date\" restaurant. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"RED is my go-to spot for sushi in Madison and I find that they never disappoint. It's certainly on the pricier side compared to more low-key sushi joints, but as soon as you step in to the restaurant, you realize why. RED is upscale, modern, and lively - their menu matches the atmosphere with plenty of inventive rolls. Their sushi is delicious and artistic - the fish is always top notch and you can tell that the chefs take care to make each roll special.

If you're not a huge fan of creative sushi and prefer the classics, RED does that too. I often grab take-out after work and enjoy their more simple rolls, such as the california roll, green bean tempura, or chicken tempura roll (trust me - delicious). 

If you're looking for an upscale restaurant with a hip, lively atmosphere, and want the best sushi in downtown Madison, head to RED."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always beautifully presented, (works of art) and tastes amazing. I have never had an item I didn't like, and I especially enjoy the sashimi platter. The new location is gorgeous and only adds to the experience. So far I have only had lunch at the new location, so I can't comment on the wait times for dinner, but it was full on a Friday at lunch time...which I think is a sign of how good it is!  In the past, at the previous location, we always had to wait for a table for dinner, but we knew this was the case and didn't go unless we were prepared to wait.  We used to have to go elsewhere and have a drink while waiting, so even if we do have to wait now, at least there is a bar available in the restaurant now! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I am rating Red Sushi's cocktails and bartender, Rob, with 5 stars.

I'm usually a wine drinker, but the cocktails were so tempting, I actually ended up trying two of them--the Ornery Mule first then the Parapluie.  Make that 2 Parapluie's, but who's counting?  Hey, I wasn't driving!  

They were both so delicious, I was nothing short of delighted when the Parapluie turned out even tastier than the Ornery Mule. (One comment on the Mule--I agreed with Rob the chili strings were probably best left out.  One would invariably glue itself to my bottom lip with every sip.  A tad annoying, but possibly worth the cool factor.  They looked ethereal, floating untethered and suspended at various angles in my martini glass.)

My associates and I shared 3 rolls.  The Lollipop Roll was was more like a creative way to present a salad--unusually clean and unembellished.  And slippery!  Tough for a novice to hang on with chopsticks, and nearly too big to eat in one bite.  

Two of us learned that we really like rolls without sticky rice.  The Saigon Roll was my favorite.  All kinds of tasty stuff in there.  Didn't love the Dragon Roll.  Too big and messy and too much going on for me.  But I usually eat sashimi at a sushi restaurant--like, just give me a plate of raw fish.  I must be part penguin or something.

I have to say, without a referral, I would have walked right by this place.  The exterior seemed a bit shabby, but I would go back for the cocktails every time I return to Madison if I could.  I liked our spot at the bar, wrapped around the outside corner by the door.  Made me miss Whisky, a bar in my hometown that made THE BEST dark and stormy but closed recently."}
{"text":"You will love it! The whole experience is great -  especially if you sit in Ryan's section, he was so fun and attentive w/out hovering while serving us amazing dish after amazing dish. Must go!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Sushi restaurant in Madison. The rolls are beautifully presented and very fresh. My favorite is the super volcano roll - just delicious. Rolls are prepared at the sushi bar, and it's a cool place to sit if you want to see the care that goes into each dish. Red is moving to a larger space, so I hope it keeps the great atmosphere of the old location."}
{"text":"Not a bad sushi spot. They were incredibly accommodating of my loathing of mayonnaise, and prepared different versions of the spicy tuna roll and so on. The soft shell crab roll was so-so, definitely not worth the money. The vibe was pretty upbeat and pleasant, too. I was in town for business and sat at the sushi bar. Overall, recommended. The spinach salad was great, spicy tuna with sriracha instead of mayo was amazing, California roll was decent. Skip the soft shell unless you need it bad!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi in Madison. It's also the only place where I'll spring for a special roll-- the salmon lover's with fresh raw salmon, smoked salmon, and salmon caviar is amazing. All the sushi is well-constructed and nicely presented. I also like the option of subbing out rice for cucumber, but I think that the $2 surcharge is a bit much, especially since the sushi isn't cheap to begin with. 

My major complaint is the space. It's way too cramped and the tables are too close together. I always get takeout to avoid it, but there's not even a good place to stand while you're waiting."}
{"text":"Crème de la crème of sushi Madison, sushi chef is very creative and friendly, love this place will visit soon!!!"}
{"text":"PROS: Best sushi in Madison (that we've tried so far)
CONS: ?

The sushi and maki rolls were really fresh and tasty. They have a large selection of wines and sakes, and the atmosphere and service were excellent! I wish they had mochi ice cream on the menu, but otherwise,  everything was awesome."}
{"text":"They have great specialty rolls plus sushi and sashimi. I would recommend just going for the specialty rolls. Most of them have either tuna, salmon, avocado, or cream cheese (and some combination thereof) but they switch it up! Seating is hard to come by on a weekend night, but they do take reservations, and there are several bars nearby you can wait at. Most of the rolls come with 8 pieces, and 2-3 rolls will make a good dinner for 2. Sake selection is decent, and they also have a good wine and beer list. Fish tasted fresh, and I would definitely go back for a nice date night or happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5.....
But I do that this time!
The decoration of this new location is great! Simple but very new & update. 
The server knows his job. It's sound \"obvious\" but it is not. And he was nice. 
The sushi is not your everyday one. It's unique and high quality. 
We also order \"non sushi\" plate- pork and scallop which was great. 
Pricy restaurant but the best and most creative sushi in madison"}
{"text":"I had previously eatin at the old location several times for lunch. Always had a good experience.  Decided to try this new location for dinner on a Friday night. 

This new location is super nice. The atmosphere is many steps above the previous location and just feels like \"the place to be\".

As expected, it was busy. The wait was only 30 minutes, so not bad. They take your cell phone number and text you when your seat is ready. However, two spots opened at the bar, so we decided to have a drink and eat at the bar. 

We ordered a couple of drinks and some rolls. Wow, these rolls were excellent!  Full of flavor and just looked amazing.  Hands down, the best sushi I've had in Madison.  Service was great and with 4 rolls and two double top shelf bourbon and cokes, the bill was $75. I didn't feel it was too bad for a great meal and an equally cool atmosphere. 

I'll happily go back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We couldn't get a reservation so we just walked in which they did ask us to be done at a certain time because it was a reserved table. So that was nice. Our waiter was not very helpful but the food definitely made up for it! We only ordered sushi and it was very fresh and expertly prepared. They even gave us some extra pieces-not the cheaper pieces, the extra pieces are the most expensive pieces that we ordered! We will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Madison! Every time I've been in, I've had an incredible experience with amazing food and great atmosphere. I love ordering the seaweed salad as a starter, theirs is fresh and flavorful and the cucumber adds a great crunch. I have tried a variety of their rolls and all of them have been of great quality and extremely tasty!"}
{"text":"Due to some pretty amazing yelp reviews I went to Red Sushi with the girlfriend.  WOW!  I was super impressed with the food.  First, the sheer number of rolls is amazing.  Both special and traditional rolls.  Secondly, their Rolls are so innovative and decorative. After going to Red Sushi you will look at other sushi rolls as just plain.  I had plenty of Rolls that night as well as sushi and sashimi; but the ones that stood out were the Super Volcano Roll, Fire Cracker Roll, and Spicy Yellowtail Roll.   The ambiance is very hip, the decor is great, and it's right downtown.  Thank you YELP for helping me discover this GEM!"}
{"text":"Here fishy fishy....
Seeing it is Ash Wednesday and being the devout Creaster that I am,I thought it important to indulge in some fish. I thought it would greatly compliment the meatloaf I still had in my tummy from lunch quite nicely.

Anyway.

I like Red Sushi. I like it in the way that hey, you know what you are getting. Red Sushi is consistent, but it is nothing awe-inspiring. It is almost like that Digornio pizza you throw in the oven when you get home from work. Meh. It is okay. It is edible. Does it taste good? Yea. It taste the same every time. But, you know what you're getting and in a way you are almost settling. That is how Red Sushi is for me. I try different rolls but they still somehow manage to all taste the same. I can't really blame anyway, as Madison is a long way from a coast. 

Server was great. Attentive, never let my water glass get empty. My only major qualm is how heavy that door is, yet how cold is manages to get in there. I was sitting halfway down the restaurant and I still felt a major draft every time the door opened. Red Sushi isn't exorbitantly priced either, which is a plus in my book. 

Will I be back? Yes. Eventually. However, I'd like to see some more creativity and more flavorful rolls."}
{"text":"Dylan K: STFU.  Who do you think you are?  This place is on par or above!  Red Sushi is the best Sushi in Madison!!  You don't know what you're talking about.  Jack is the best sushi chef in Madison.  Ashe D: You're Awesome! 5 stars for sure!

The fish is always super fresh and never has a fishy or ammonia taste.  The sushi chef breaks down whole sides of fish himself, is very knowledgeable, and is willing to share his knowledge with samples.  Red has some of the best drinks.  The Red Lemonade is great!  While we have had just about every roll on the menu, and never had one we don't like, our favorites are the Super Volcano Roll, The Mermaid Roll, White Snow, and the Crab Lover Roll.  Their entrees are also very good.  Red has a great, relaxed atmosphere and great servers.  Definitely worth visiting!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best sushi place I have been to yet.

For starters the decor and atmosphere are excellent; although, the dining area is small.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to us the whole time as well. 

I went here with a small group of friends.  I ordered a Shrimp Tempura roll and a Chicken Tempura roll.  They were both excellent.  My boyfriend ordered an entree of eel with rice and caviar.  That was also fantastic. 

I returned here last summer and got the Unagi-don which is eel.  I really enjoyed it.  However, my boyfriend ordered a plate of assorted sashimi and was really dissapointed.  All the rolls he got were just really basic, like a California roll.  It was O.K. but nothing special and not worth the price at all.  The last time he had ordered the sashimi he had gotten a much more impressive assortment.  
   

If I have one complaint its that our drinks all cost $3.  I ordered a soft drink and my boyfriend ordered tea.  I think three dollars is a bit expensive for soda, so next time I go there I might just drink water.

Over all I recommend it."}
{"text":"I decided to grab sushi for lunch along with a friend and the sushi here is probably the best I've had in Madison! 

Their lunch special, 2 rolls for $13, is amazing! I got the crunchy salmon and Godzilla roll along with miso soup. The miso soup was light and hearty along with bits of tofu and seaweed. The sushi came out shortly after and honestly, at first glance, there's a ton of panko over dressing the sushi but once you taste it---wow. The rice was moist and sticky, the fillings just blended together which created an amazing texture and taste. Best sushi in Madison hands down."}
{"text":"Comparing to other Sushi options in Madison, Red would be 4 stars. However, considering its marketing strategy and price range, I am basing my review on a higher standard. 

Me, my husband and our 4yo went for a late weekday lunch to avoid the dinner crowd (we had to time strategically for the small child). We ordered the tsunami, Santa's belly, 6 pieces of nigiri chef's choice of fish, yellowtail scallion roll, pork-belly buns, Kampachi sashimi appetizer, and wagyu beef burger. Yes it's a lot of food, but there were multiple items that each of us wanted to try so this was the compromise.

The Kampachi was the favorite. It came with a delightful ponzu (sp.) sauce. My husband thought the sauce was bit too light but that's a matter of personal taste. The wagyu beef burger was also good; the patty was juicy and nicely seasoned. The pork-belly came with kimchi and slices of pickled cucumber. I though this combination was a bit too acidic but the pork slices were nice. Our server was knowledgeable and considerate. 

I took two stars off for some of the technical issues I had with the food. Again, this is in comparison to the \"finer\" sushi establishments one would find in San Fran, NYC and abroad. The biggest problem I had was the cold and hard rice. There's simply too much rice per piece. I expect quality sushi to be crafted in equal, comfortable bite sizes, with the rice in a temperature that is only slightly cooler than room temperature but not cold, and to have a texture that is soft but not mushy. This kind of rice, topped with a quality cut of fish, should result in a \"melt in your mouth\" texture. I've seen sushi chefs make a small dent in the rice before laying the fish on top to create this special mouthfeel. The nigiri pieces were shaped wider on the bottom, an indication of less skilled chef, the rice temperature too cold and the texture was too hard. In fact, there were grains that were slightly undercooked in the middle. However, I did appreciate that the plating of the nigiri pieces followed the standard order of fish sequence - something you don't see in many Madison sushi establishments. 

The rolls were also too big. Additionally, the spicy mayo atop the Tsunami was rather bland - I would have liked a bit more spice in the mixture. It tasted like regular mayonnaise on top of a pile of tuna puree that's mixed with chili oil. 

I give creativity points to the Santa Belly. The pork belly and coconut was a nice pairing. However, the raspberry vinaigrette did not compliment the flavor. The sugary nature of this particular dressing failed to balance out the fat. 

Overall, the restaurant left me with the impression of quantity over quality. It is obvious that the owners put a lot of thoughts in designing the space and its menu. Unfortunately the execution fell short of the image it's trying to project."}
{"text":"I started this restaurant at two stars because my initial impression of this place was not good. I was confused about the menu, and the bartender was not very helpful. I was confused regarding the sushi on the black menu and the white menu. Unagi (my favorite) is listed on both parts of the menu, but there's a price difference. Why? I didn't think this was a hard question to ask. 

The bartender's reply? He pointed to the black menu and said, \"Well, this is all sushi.\" I pointed to the white menu and said, \"Well this is sushi too.\" He said the same thing again, and I said the same thing again as if talking to a 2 year old. He said, \"Well, this is cooked  (pointed to the white menu), and this is not (pointed to black menu).\" I replied, \"Unagi is always cooked; no one ever serves raw eel, even if they blow torch it a bit. How many pieces do you get with the rolls (pointed to white menu)?\" He replied, \"8.\" I asked, \"Are they rolls like this (holding my hand in a circle), or this (holding like a cone)?\" He said, \"They are like circles.\" So, for those of you who actually know your way around a sushi menu, the white menu contains maki or uramaki rolls, and the black menu contains nigiri. The process of learning this took about 20 minutes.

A customer next to me later asked the bartender for sushi recommendations, and he said, \"I don't really eat sushi.\" Why on earth would you have someone work at a Japanese restaurant (that serves sushi) and hire someone who does not eat sushi??? There was only one bartender, so he was the front line to answering customers' questions, whether dining at the bar or getting food to go. Sometimes I just wonder at the stupidity of people who supposedly manage businesses! Due to lack of training, this restaurant starts at a two-star rating of \"I've experienced better\" because I have been to Japanese restaurants who can effectively explain the difference between different kinds of sushi. Here's what I ordered (about $35):

Miso soup - Tinny, lacked depth. Whatever pre-packaged brand used, it was not good. There was a strange after-taste as well.

Seaweed salad - Too much cucumber (plain and raw) and not much seaweed. I would have definitely preferred all seaweed like all the other Japanese restaurants I have been to because the seaweed had a great flavor. I actually liked this item the most, sans cucumber. 

Unagi uramaki - The unagi rolls on the white menu are uramaki because the seaweed is on the inside. I really liked this. The unagi was perfectly cooked - sweet but still able to taste the unagi itself. I would've added a star for the salad and unagi sushi.

Ramen - Absoutely pathetic and reason for keeping this review at two stars. This is advertised as a spicy miso broth. What you really get is a gloopy, thick, almost Japanese curry-like broth. It should be noted that Japanese curry isn't spicy at all; it's more on the sweeter side. If this is to remain a broth, then it should be clear (like all other Japanese restaurants who advertise a tonkotsu broth). However, because this tasted so bad, I ate four bites and that's it. I did eat the soft boiled egg, which was the best part, but it would have been better without that brown crud from the gravy (supposedly soup). Unfortunately the right noodles are used, and this makes me sad - what a waste of beautiful noodles.

I do realize Madison, WI is not the most happening place for Asians. But if you are going to be a Japanese restaurant, then be one. Train the staff to know the food and culture. Have the staff taste the differences between the different kinds of sushi so they can communicate to customers. Be proud of our Asian culture and educate the population especially in an area of the country where there aren't many of us. These tips are not rocket science!

Miso soup $3.50
Seaweed salad $6
Unagi roll $9.50
Ramen $12
Vodka drink during happy hour $4.50
Tax $1.71
Total $37.21"}
{"text":"Only sushi place I, as a Los Angeles native will go to. Been to most Japanese restaurants in search to satisfy the LA asian palette. Prices are not cheap, but you wouldn't regret it. Beef carpaccio, mussel/blue clam apps are a must try as well as the cream cheese stuffed jalapeños and tempura. Super volcano is most people's fave, but spicy Godzilla is good as well. Honestly, my advice would be for vegetarians to get the tempura and cream cheese stuffed jalapeños and a vegetarian roll. Most rolls on the menu are delicious. If raw fish is not your cup of tea, go with the deep fried rolls. And basque cake is a must for dessert. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Updating this review yet again after many more visits...this place has honestly become my favorite restaurant in Madison, right up there with Heritage Tavern and Graze.

Red has fantastic quality sushi compared to any other Japanese restaurant in Madison. Muramoto honestly does not come close - I really can't understand people who compare the two. Red blows Muramoto out of the water.

While it is a little pricey, the quality and surprisingly large amount of sushi you get (the more expensive rolls are quite bulky) compensate for this. 

One standout roll I've been obsessed with is the Butterfly Roll - perfectly seared albacore and the mango salsa adds so much interesting flavor. Highly recommended!

Please do yourself a favor and come here. I can't emphasize enough how much I appreciate having a place like this in Madison!"}
{"text":"We arrived for Christmas Eve dinner around 8 pm. We had a great time, lots of laughs, our server was awesome, warm and personable. The sushi was just ok. We had some issues with some of the specialty sushi rolls being somewhat dried out, and others were overly sauced and sloppy (the 'Volcano'). 

The spicy rolls weren't very. 'The Mermaid' came highly recommended, but the strawberry slices on top were dried out and chewy. 'The Grinch' was attractively presented, but the flavor combo just didn't wow me. The spider roll had sprouts on it, the strong flavor of which completely dominated the other ingredients.

Regular, basic rolls were done properly. We will stick to ordering them next time. Also, given that it was Christmas eve, maybe their best sushi staff had the night off? For $150.00-ish for three, and only one drink apiece, it definitely left something to be desired.

The cocktails were great, however. Really delicious. One person had a dirty martini, another the Agent Argo, and I had a citrusy gin based drink with Aperol that was uhhhhmazing. I'm blanking on the name...will edit it in later.

The creme brulee we ordered to share three ways for dessert was simply out of this world. Dining companions weren't as enthusiastic, so they left most of it for me. Merry Christmas, ho ho ho!"}
{"text":"Ok. Yes. RED has regained my previous opinion as the best sushi destination in Madison. 

After my previous review, the owner reached out to me to discuss my experience, to apologize, and to offer me and a companion a return visit on her to make it up to us. Very, very generous and a clear indication of their level of dedication to providing the best experience possible.

My daughter and I went for my birthday dinner on Valentine's Day weekend, and it was outstanding. The service, the sushi, the drinks all completely top notch. Could not have been better. Thank you RED for doing a complete 180º from my last experience...we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Years ago, my husband and I started a tradition: Sushi Friday.  Seriously, we went to a sushi restaurant every Friday.  We're sushi fiends.

Red has opened since we moved to Madison, and it has been a wonderful find for us.  They have a huge selection of rolls, but they also have a sizeable non-sushi menu.  I haven't tried any of the entrees, but I've been out with friends who have enjoyed them.

Every visit, my husband and I order the Godzilla roll and the Volcano roll, plus one or two others that vary.  My husband loves the rolls that have steak on them; I enjoy the Rain Roll and the veggie rolls.  Everything is always delicious and the presentation beautiful.

My husband appreciates their sake selection, and that you can order sake in several different sizes. 

In the time since we've been going to Red, we've notice that it's become more popular and crowded.  I do with they took reservations for groups less than 4.  Expect a wait when you arrive.  Turnaround time on the food is typically good, but sometimes the food takes a bit longer to reach the table due to the high volume; I suggest getting miso soup or edamame.  The servers are also friendly and knowledgeable.  

I think the key to enjoying Red is to know they'll be busy -- that's because they're good -- and plan accordingly.  Definitely our favorite sushi place in Madison."}
{"text":"Very cozy, dimly lit, very warm which is good because it's 1 degree outside but it feels like Negative 9 degrees.  It's 2 blocks away from where I'm staying. 
The Miso Soup is $3 and it's a big bowl.
The waiter brought water to me without me asking, that was the first thing he did. I ordered Chicken Teriyaki which isn't on the menu. FYI, make sure to avoid the chicken wrapped in bacon if you're like me and that's not your cup of tea.  
As I was waiting for the my Chicken Teriyaki, the waiter (Michael) refilled my lemonade before I was even halfway done.
EXCELLENT SERVICE SO FAR.
This place seems to be reasonably priced so far, I still haven't gotten the bill yet. 
The final bill was $22.16 total which might seem kinda pricey BUT this was my only meal of the day and I ordered cooked food in a sushi bar. You always have to give some to get something, that's my motto. I emphasize quality over quantity at all times.
The chicken was juicy, not dry, the sauce was delicious and ample but not overwhelming to the point it masked the natural flavors of the vegetables and chicken.
The rice was sticky enough to eat with chop sticks, which I did. 
The veggies included were asparagus, squash, and zucchini.  I was equally by the customer service of the waiter who kept checking on me, sometimes before I  was ready but it's good to see a person take their job serious.  I left a $5 tip.  I know waiters and waitresses make less than minimum wage so the tips are their life blood and I respect that.
I've received service in the past where I would tip the person $40 to $50 on a $100 check, bringing my grand total for the evening to $140 to $150.  I'm really putting this out there so that people in the hospitality industry can understand that people will tip if you if your service is good.
FYI , $5 is 23% of $22.16, which above the standard 15% gratuity."}
{"text":"I was in during lunchtime and was sat right away by the hostess. There were seating options at the bar, inside or outside on the patio.  Being a Friday, they had both a lunch specials menu and the regular menu available to order from. On the front of the regular menu, they were offering some seasonal rolls. The lemon drop roll caught my eye right away. I love fresh ingredients and citrus in the summertime. I paired my roll with their blueberry hibiscus tea. The tea was very flavorful and crisp to the taste buds. I'm glad I didn't go with anything additonal to eat as the roll was plenty! The delicate micro greens on top paired with the fresh salmon and other ingredients was good. Each piece of the roll was about two bites, which made it a messy roll. The mess was worth it though. Keep a napkin handy as you will need it. The prices are a little higher than other sushi places in town, but the quality of the ingredients here is prevalent in each dish I saw while dining. Each plate was a work of art! This would be a great date night place for couples. Or, a place to be seen at the bar. It's got a nice classy vibe throughout."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison. Hands down. 

The rolls are light, fresh (as fresh as midwest sushi can be) and flavorful. If you want sushi that doesn't need gobs of mayo based sauce or fried ingredients, this is your spot. 

Get's 4 stars instead of 5 because, let's face it, we're in Madison."}
{"text":"Okay, so it took me a long time to finally write a review about Red Sushi. Why? Maybe because I wanted to keep all the fresh sushi to myself. I've been here quite a few times and have had mainly their sushi. For lunch, you can get 2 rolls for only $10; add miso soup for only $1 more and you have a meal ;). The cool thing about their rolls is that they offer the good stuff and at good quality/freshness. For example, there's the Spicy Scallop or Crab (yes - real crab not crab imitation on their lunch menu), Duck Tempura Roll, Red Snapper, Yellowtail, Spicy Escolar...etc. My point is that they continue with quality even during lunch specials; majority of sushi joints here mainly offer crab imitation, shrimp, salmon and vegetables only during their lunch specials. 

Other than sushi, I've had their Grilled Black Cod, Calamari and P.E.I. Mussels (creamy bacon garlic white wine sauce) that were all pretty yummy. I've only had the cod once since $13 for an 'appetizer' portion hurt my wallet more than it filled my stomach, but the flavor is pretty worth it.

All in all, it's a great place for lunch and dinner. Note: make reservations for dinner during the weekend or you'll find yourself on a 1hr+ waitlist.

{"text":"If someone asked me what is your favorite restaurant in Madison I would say Red. Is it pricey, yes? Is it worth it, absolutely! It is upscale, modern and the food is innovative and fresh. My fiance and I have been coming here since it opened on King St. Last year he actually proposed to me at this restaurant because he knew how much I like it. This is our restaurant we go to for special occasions or a special date night. Due to the price point it is not a every week or even every other week restaurant. 

Everything I have had here has been great. My favorite rolls are the Bagel, Mermaid and Tsunami. The rolls are big so you do get a really good portion. The entrees and appetizers I have tried have also been very good. 

If you are coming on a normally busy night like Friday or Saturday I would recommend doing a reservation. If you do not it maybe an hour or two wait depending on the night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Madison. 

The spicy tuna and seaweed salads are my go-to appetizers. The fish is fresh and there is a great selection of unique maki rolls. 

Knocked it down one star because it is really quite pricey for the size of their portions...but I guess you are in part paying for the ambiance and the nice mod decor."}
{"text":"Red has a pretty great selection of sushi. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice too and being on the square makes it a fun neighborhood as well.

I'd say skip the standard rolls (i.e. California, Spicy Tuna, Philadelphia, etc.) and go for their specialty ones. The riceless rolls are a nice option to have too and I like that you can get that option with quite a few of their rolls. It's kind of pricy, but sushi's never too cheap and it's kind of to be expected with the location."}
{"text":"It was very crowded and food was way overpriced. We left and found a better restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"Great place but really busy! The rolls are huge and definitely the real deal. They put a lot of thought into their special rolls, they even had seasonal items. I had the candy apple roll, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Now that they've moved to a new location, I enjoyed my experience much better! Sushi is still great, although it is more expensive than other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"A facet when I visit my favorite city. My old haunt moved to a new location on west Washington but it's four times as stunning and the food maintains the best sushi in Madison."}
{"text":"At first the tucked away location of Red made us wonder, but once we stepped inside to a packed house we quickly hopped on board. 

Make a reservation if you can because weekends bring in the crowds of dedicated Red Diners. We managed to snag a table without a reservation, but only due to timing and a very skilled (and friendly) hostess. 

Waitstaff knows the menu and will happily make recommendations and answer questions. The menu is extensive, but somehow manages to cater to the sushi novice and the more experienced. Also try the seasonal specials because the combinations are so thoughtfully engineered. 

Cannot wait to come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We found this place yesterday evening as a result of all the wonderful reviews posted here, and boy! It did not disappoint.  Because it was a busy evening, we were seated at the sushi bar, fortuitously in front of  head chef Jack Yip.  It was wonderful seeing the care, precision and speed he and all the sushi chefs displayed preparing the food.  My friend had a vegetarian trio of rolls, deliciously prepared and beautifully plated, that he very much enjoyed.  I sampled his veggie tempura roll and loved it.  These are not meager rolls, by the way; three will feed an adult. He had also requested that one usual ingredient of the rolls be omitted, and appreciated that the dish arrived exactly as he had requested. (It may seem like a small thing, but I know that, when pressed for time, it can be hard to break habits of preparation). That's the kind of attention to detail that assures we will be repeat customers of Red.

As a vegetarian, I was intrigued by the high praise our server gave the kitchen's vegetarian pho. Veggie pho is often bland (or, as one says, \"delicately seasoned\"), but this was complex and robust. Plentiful vegetables, just enough fresh lime, chili, and loads of Thai basil rounded out the dish.  Best I've had, by a lot.

The ambiance is fun, friendly, and lively.  Our server was very helpful in navigating the food and especially the sake selection.  Prices were quite reasonable. When next I visit Madison, I will be sure to revisit Red."}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi! Definitely the best in town!  My husband and I come here all the time.  It is a little more pricey than the other sushi places but well worth it.  
Every roll I have had there is good which makes it hard to choose.  My typical go to's are the Crunchy Tuna, Philly, & Volcano.  
The drinks are pretty awesome too.  There is a Red Sidecar that is BOMB but isn't on the menu anymore (they will still make).
The downs...Long waits for dinner.  If you have a group of 4 or more, call for a reservation.  Don't let the wait discourage.  It is worth it!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best sushi in Madison. Creative rolls, always fresh fish and friendly service. Wait list can get long quick because of the size of the restaurant.  Good news is--Red is moving to a new location on west Washington end of July 2016:). So excited to see the new place!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, fun staff and stellar sushi. Lunch is a good deal and usually pretty quick."}
{"text":"So so so good. I always return to my favorites. They are both vegetarian. I know, it seems strange. But the shiitake mushroom sushi--if you think there's no way that would make good sushi, fine. All the more for me. The avocado roll is even better if you use the forbidden rice, which has a chewy, nutty texture."}
{"text":"Had dinner here two days in a row and I'll be back for more when I am in town.  I heard that this is new location and it looks very trendy.  Okay, who cares too much about how the place look, it is all about the food, right?  ^_^.  Right, about the fish.  They are very fresh and yummy.  I am surprise to find such a great sushi place here in downtown Madison.  The service is very nice too.  Been serviced by Megan and Lydia, they were great.  I was at the sushi bar and Chef Jack, if that is his correct name, he is very friendly as well.  I rarely come to Wisconsin, but I'll be back for more when I am here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison & is the best sushi restaurant.  It's always busy & typically you will have to wait for a table or even a place at the bar. But it's well worth the wait. There are many bars around restaurant to go have a drink until they text you that your table is ready. A few of my favorite rolls are the spicy scallop with avocado & the Godzilla.  Each time I've been here the service has always been great. Great selection of wine which is my go to drink when eating sushi. They also have other dishes besides sushi but I can't speak for them."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Madison! Great selection of sashimi and the miso is the best I have ever had. They pour a good stiff cocktail so check it out if you can!"}
{"text":"Review to come on Election Day after I'm done working as an election officer at the polls.

7 November 2016 - an overdue return to Red, having recently learned that they've moved out of the confined space they previously occupied on King Street, near the Majestic Theater.  As it happened, without reservations, we got two places at the sushi bar, right where we'd wanted to sit, after being told they could give us no reservation when we asked at 4:30, as they were booked.  The person who answered encouraged us to come in nonetheless, promising that we'd be able to get seated.

We were the two of us, myself and Mitchell, who is far and away the greater aficionado of sushi.  We both ordered a bowl of edamame served with salt on them, and a side bowl of some sauce, which neither of us cared for.  Myself, I also ordered all nigiri: Bluefin Magaro, Uni, Hamachi, Ika, Hokkaido, Tako, and Ebi.  The hamachi wasn't prepared as soon as the rest of my sushi was brought to me, but came about a minute later, with THREE instead of two, clearly the kitchen saying \"sorry we didn't get it all at once.\"  That was nice, and I gave the third one to Mitchell, who didn't order any hamachi for himself.  We also ordered a bottle of Junmai Daiginjo: Otter Fest 50 from Dassai, brewed by Asahi Shuzu company in Yamaguchi Prefecture.   It was delicious, instantly reminiscent of flowers.  From the label: Yamadanishiki and Moachi rice are cautiously polished for this Daiginjo brew.  The graceful aroma and delicate sweetness of honey brings exquisite drinking enjoyment that lingers.  Medium body, layered with smooth, rounded flavor.  Alcohol is 17.0% by volume.

Mitchell had Edamame, Bluefin, Eascolar, Striped Bass, Uni, Fluke, Kanpachi, Octopus, Hokkaido, Madai, and Ika."}
{"text":"Four stars for food.
Two stars for service.

I was really really excited to come to Red Sushi. Sushi in Madison is generally mediocre, but I had heard that the fish at Red Sushi was good quality. And it was! Their  rolls, conceptually, aren't anything special. But I think what makes Red Sushi so popular is the quality of their fish. The hamachi was DELICIOUS. I had to get two orders, it was so good. And I love  that they top their sushi (non-rolls) with scallion. It just amplifies the flavor of the fish. One critique on the food is that I wish they offered some rolls with crunchy flakes inside of them. All of their \"crunchy\" rolls had tempura fried items (e.g. shrimp or salmon), but it'd be nice to have some non-crunchy rolls supplemented with just flakes to make them crunchy. I find tempura fried items to be too starchy in rolls, but by adding just the panko flakes, it gives you a good amount of crunch without tasting too deep fried.

What I really had a problem with was the service. I'm sure their waitresses are fine and the hostesses were really nice. But we made the mistake of sitting at the bar, and so the bartender served as our waiter (I think his name was Sean). He was just rude and seemed to not care for us as customers for no apparent reason. Strange thing was that he seemed incredibly friendly to everyone except me and my boyfriend. I'm not sure what that was about. After we sat down, I ordered a non-alcoholic drink and he sort of scoffed at me. Seriously? I'm still tipping you, dude. And he forgot the cherries in my shirley temple (I had to get a shirley temple to honor her recent death). Boo, Sean... boo. He also just acted really irritated every time we asked him a question about the food. He scoffed at me again when I asked if their mochi was made in house. Is it that ridiculous of a question? Overall just a bad service experience.

I'll definitely come here again, but try to sit at a table next time. Or if I sit at the bar, make sure it's on a night when rude dude is not working. But the fish is too good to pass up. I'll be day dreaming about that hamachi for weeks to come."}
{"text":"Madison is such a cool town to explore, so when my friends said let's go get some sushi we were in. As our friends are Madison foodies I expected no disappointments to be going down. The spot they chose, Red Sushi, was all that and then some. Truly one of the better sushi bars I've been to as of late. 

First let me state this place gets busy, everyday from what the waiter told us. We waited an hour to get in, but it was so worth it. We wasted no time and order a half dozen rolls or so to start. From what I remembered the first order would include:

King Triton, Phoenix, King Crab California, Salmon Skin, Super Volcano, and the Atlantis. 

Favorites for that round were hands down the Volcano and the Phoenix. The Volcano was really AMAZING! All that goodness layered on top. Truly a favorite for us. We actually ordered another set of those two rolls and added a couple others. By the time these came and we gobbled em up, we were all in serious sushi coma.

Drinks we had were also really good. The Ornery Mule and some cucumber drink the ladies ordered were very well crafted. Truth be told, this joint was worth the wait. Sushi was very freshly prepared and the atmosphere was awesome. A little techno in the background and semi-dimlite lighting made the mood feel right, setting us up for a spectacular evening. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on Sunday after hearing all the good reviews. RED had some of the freshest fish I have had in a very long time and I lived on the west coast. Hands down the best place that I have had sushi not just in Madison but does compare with places in San Diego and LA!! It was on the pricy side but well worth it especially after tasting the fish which was smooth almost a subtle and refined texture. Am definitely looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great customer service from beginning to end--cheerful hostess, attentive bartenders, courteous runners and polite and knowledgeable servers.

The ramen with pork belly was a hit, the Buddha role is massive and super filling--it's like two sushi rolls in one, which appears to be the case for most of their rolls. The wagyu shumai were a challenge to eat and needed seasoning. Steamed edamame is served with a delicious thinned gochujang sauce. There's a pretty good sized wine menu to boot.

RED is also super kid-friendly. There were at least five children under the age of 2 among the packed dining room and bar area. The restaurant plays what I call \"cool hotel lounge music,\" which helps counter any kid who may be \"vocalizing any displeasure\" and the bathrooms are all private water closets with diaper changing stations, even in the men's rooms (awesome and thank you from us parents!)"}
{"text":"servers were very great but we had bad experience for filet mignon. my girlfriend cannot eat seafood so she had to order a steak. Surely this place is for seafood not steak because they do not know how to cook medium rare. when we got the steak, it was totally cooked medium. i have tried filet mignon at 4 other places and this was not a medium rare. we told them its not medium rare and they cut the very middle side of a steak where it looked like medium rare and other portions were cooked almost well done. I am giving one more star just because of server. Sushi was fresh just like most other places"}
{"text":"People really seem to love Red and Ive given it 2 tries to win me over but it falls short.

The rolls always seem to be messily made and not very uniform or visually appealing. While they do have a large variety and we did get 8 different kinds between the several times Ive been there nothing has had a very impressive flavor. The fish seemed fresh enough though with no hint of funkyness. I would say they are middle of the road and a OK choice if you cannot visit Muramoto or VIP"}
{"text":"Place was hopping in a Wednesday night.got a seat at the bar.  Sushi wad great.  Wife and I both loved the super volcano roll."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SERVICE NOT THE SUSHI...sushi was actually pretty good!

Being busy is never an excuse for poor service. And poor service we did receive. Funny enough, we sat at the bar, where you usually get great service, given that you're right in front of the bartender and sushi counter. 

It was a Saturday night, and yes, it was busy. We waited about 40 minutes for a table, which was fine, as we went down the street to grab a beer while waiting. A couple minutes after we sat down at the bar/counter, we were ready to order drinks. It took the waitress/bartender about 15 minutes to take our order...she kept saying she would be with us in a minute after we flagged her down. 

Ordered drinks along with some rolls. After 15 minutes or so, we still did not have our drinks. We asked and the waitress said they would be right up. To our surprise, our rolls came out and still no drinks! Halfway into eating, we asked about drinks again and said to just forget them since we'd be finished eating by the time they came out, at the rate they were going. 

The bartender/waitress kept telling us she was \"SO BUSY\" every time we asked for something. Really? Not even a genuine apology. And who tells their customers they're super busy and expects that to make everything ok? Really? I hope the manager/owner reads this review and reconsiders who they hire, how they train, and how they run their business."}
{"text":"In town for a conference and wanted sushi!!! Food was DELICIOUS , waiter was attentive and super kewl. Thank you Cameron for making our visit pleasant! The surf & turf !!!! Cheesecake desert ! Will come again would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I hardly like making reviews after one visit, but for red Sushi I'm making an exception. 

To begin with, my boyfriend and I had reservations for 7 PM, but we ended up coming 15 minutes early. The host was super friendly, and told us we could wait at the bar or at the seats. After just 5 or so minutes, we were seated at our tables. 

Our server, I can't recall her name to save my life, was phenomenal and answered all our questions. She was attentive, and she made us feel very taken care of while dining. Another plus was it felt everyone working there helped each other out by clearing off plates and what not to ensure fluidity and customer satisfaction. 

In addition, the sushi they serve is phenomenal. The flavors of the sauced complemented the sushi grade seafood. The appetizers they offered were delicious and amazing. They also had an extensive drink menu too choose from!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great atmosphere. The food was amazing. Very defining in their unique and indifferent relationship to interpretation of sushi. The bar staff were wonderful in suggesting complementary drinks with your specific choice of coronary experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We had a successful apartment-hunting day so we set out for a late lunch celebration. We strolled by Red Sushi and figured, why not? Overall, we enjoyed our time. Service was great and I liked the feel of the place. The weird thing was that all of the staff/chefs hung around one area, chatting, but I think they were just getting ready for the dinner rush.

The edamame wasn't cooked enough, I think -- it was very hard to open the pods!

I got the sundried tomato & asparagus roll and the mushroom tempura roll. I loved the IDEA of the sundried tomato roll, but it was incredibly dry. It could use a sauce or maybe cream cheese ? The mushroom roll was good, though. Derek enjoyed both of his rolls: peking & the salmon skin. He said the mango on the peking paired quite well with the other flavors.

Then we decided to get lemon cheesecake. Erm, not good. I could barely taste the lemon! The cheesecake itself had a good texture and taste overall, but then was ruined when my mouth got to the crust. It was very dry and tasteless. Meh. Maybe a bad day.

I'd love to go back and try again, but I do hope they change up that sundried tomato roll."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered take out. The online ordering was easy, and our food was ready at the time given. We got 4 types of sushi and out of all them, we loved the Dragon roll the best. We also ordered the Peking, but we were a bit disappointed by the lack of flavor.  We'll definitely be returning though as there were lots of other things we wanted to try on the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for our first dinner date in Madison and we were definitely not disappointed with out decision. Place was quite busy for a wednesday but we were seated right away and immediately greeted by our server. We started with edamame and yakitori as appetizers. The edamame could have used a little more sea salt but the yakitori was juicy and flavorful. We then ordered the Red and the Badger signature rolls as well as the Dragon which is a traditional roll. Out of the three our favorite was the Red signature roll, spicy yet the avocado gave a great balance to the flavors. Our least favorite was the dragon, the Badger was delicious, especially with the sauce that came on the plate as well as a tad bit of wasabi. We finished with the creme Brulee, it was the perfect amount for dessert and tasted absolutely amazing with the strawberries. The drinks were strong and beer menu exotic. We had a great dinner and will come back to try more. Next time we will order three traditional rolls instead of two signature rolls, quite a price difference and the traditional roll was just as tasty as the signature ones."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison, tried many places here but most were not good. 
Staff is very friendly and the new location is very nice.
For reservations, I really wish they didn't call 20 mins to confirm, most are trying to head out the door and it's really inconvenience"}
{"text":"This place is really popular, so the wait is always pretty long here. I called in early to see if I could make a reservation for two, but they told me that you can't make a reservation for a party under four people. So we got there, and they told us a 30 minute wait (we only waited like 15). I think our server's name was Dylan, he was extremely friendly and energetic. We ordered miso soup, the \"Haru\" and the spider roll. Everything was extremely delicious and unique. The Haru roll had watermelon on it, something I've never seen before, and I really liked it! I definitely would come back here to try more. They also have vegan options, which you don't see very often at sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"Worst Experience for any restaurant I've been to in Madison, WI!!! I've lived here for nearly 5 years now. My father (coming from home in NYC) and I had our dinner and 1 drink of yamazaki 12 year each. Everything was fine until we got the check. $40 EACH for one two-ounce scotch. Never in our scotch drinking lives have my father and I paid that much for one drink (even in NYC)! For a reference, we both knew Yamazaki 12 year BOTTLE (750ml) costs $130. However for a single (not even a double) pour for two here cost $80! This was purely ridiculous. And that is fine. For a restaurant, if you want to charge $40 a drink that's all dandy. BUT TELL YOUR CUSTOMERS THAT! They NIETHER communicated this price to us nor had it written down anywhere on the menu. And if you are severely inflating the price of a drink, you HAVE to tell your customers. The female manager comes by and does apologize. She says she will take out 1 of the drinks from check, waitress brings a new check and they just took out 1 ounce ($19)! We brought this up again, \"I thought you guys were taking out 1 drink?\" The waitress was like \"I thought she meant to take out 1 drink ($40) too\" A Male manager then comes out and essentially argues with us as to why they upcharge due to allocation, etc. And essentially provides no good reason as to why they do not communicate this upcharge and price to customers and thus riles us up to the point where we literally just want to leave this establishment and nothing else. We paid whatever they charged and left. I literally live in the apartment complex 20 ft away and I will never come back. Nor would I ever recommend this place to friends or family."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Madison from LA, so I'm trying to understand the total lack of good service in town.  This is the first sushi bar I've ever been to (and  I have been to MANY), where when seated at the actual bar, I couldn't order directly from the sushi chef.  I get the impression from most of the recent reviews that the majority of customers here have never been to real sushi, and didn't think this was an abnormality.

We waited a good half hour to get a seat at the sushi bar, but that wasn't a big deal, as we gave the hostess our cell number and went for a walk.  When we were called back, she tried to seat us at a table, when there were 5 seats open at the bar.  She recovered, and when we finally sat down at the sushi bar and tried to make conversation with the chef/owner and order.  He didn't indicate at all that we needed to order from anyone else, but after 10 minutes of awkward chatting/waiting, our waitress came and said that we had to order from her.  

We had the hostess and our waitress talk up a scallop special and their rolls, so ordered a the scallop (a cold and hot combo), a crunchy tuna roll and a lolipop roll (both recommended).  The scallop sashimi was good, but the cooked part of the appetizer was greasy and overcooked, and I'm not sure where the actual scallop was.  Both of the rolls were visually pretty but very underwhelming.  We were given our first order rapid-fire without our sake.  After 20 minutes, our waitress came back and asked us if she'd forgotten our sake, and another 10 minutes after we'd refused the sake, she came back and apologized and offered us a small sake on the house (we'd ordered a bottle, not a small).

We're pretty picky about our rolls, so we figured we'd just spend the rest of the evening eating nigiri and sashimi.  The actual nigiri and sashimi were good here, and as another yelper said, the uni in particular was good. What the owner served us as hamachi however was definitely snapper, and the toro was medium toro at best."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Everything delish. Lollipop and philly rolls fresh. Cocktails on point."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I know everyone raves about this place but it missed the mark for me. My wife and I made reservations and decided to see what the buzz was about. We had drinks while we waited, bar was very full. We had good service, waiter had to be reminded a couple of times for my beer but wasn't a big deal. My big complaint was the food, we started with Miso soups and edamame, nothing elaborate, is what we expected. Then we got our roles. They were bland. To be fair we tried the six grain rice rather than the white, that may be why it was so bland. I'm an eater and I left food on the table. I may give it another chance but for all the fan fair I just don't see this place as special."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Madison. This is a great place for first time sushi eaters or for people who get overwhelmed with the long list of choices at other sushi joints. Overall, the sushi was great, we ordered 2 rolls, miso soup, and Jasmine tea. The ambiance in the restaurant was nice, small, with up beat music and close quarters to other tables. The only thing that was disappointing was the tea. They were served in nice tea pots, but they weren't loose tea leaves... it was in a tea bag.  Compared to other sushi places I would put Red in my top 5... and we have been to many restaurants! Recommend for experience, price, and location."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love RED?? I love eating her as much as possible because of the quality! The rolls are tight, fresh, flavorful, and aesthetically pleasing! The whole restaurant is swanky and always packed, but in a good way. The service is fast for a number of customers they have and you can watch the masters at work preparing your order (and plate it beautifully). The only two complaints I have are that the wait staff can be snide/pretentious and that I wish the price could drop a tiny bit. Overall, I will keep coming back because it's always worth it."}
{"text":"I love Red! I live in the neighborhood and eat here quite frequently. the staff always makes good suggestions and I've always liked everything I've gotten! 
The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is the following. I went there this past Thursday for my birthday with my sister and two friends. We got some apps, drinks and sushi. My sister insisted on telling the waitress it was my birthday and after the plates were clear she said to me specifically 'what would you like for dessert...' and then gave me the options. My friend then asked if he could order dessert as well. I was surprised when the bill came and I was charged for my dessert. Now it's not the money just the way she offered it to me that I found strange.
Regardless, I will continue to dine at Red and look forward to several other meals"}
{"text":"My first dinner in Madison - and definitely not disappointed! Made a reservation for the evening even though one may not have been needed. I was skeptical about sushi in Madison (being from California), but RED did not disappoint with its extensive menu, creative options, and choice of drinks and desserts. 

I ordered the Volcano Roll with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and loved both. A friend enjoyed the Red Roll as well as the Spicy Tuna roll. I will say I was surprised that they used surimi (crab sticks) in the roll rather than the handmade mix of crab and cream cheese that most high end places use, but with that being said, the Volcano roll was still very tasty! The ambience is cozy and fancy - perfect for a date night or dinner with drinks. Will definitely go again, hopefully for the lunch special!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with Red and I would definitely recommend it.

Highlights: 
Massive menu options from traditional to creative to seasonal.
Nice wait staff
Sushi has great flavor and is fresh
Nice decor
Great location

Lowlights:
There is ALWAYS a wait.
Service is typically pretty slow. 
I've never been blown away by any of the drinks...they're good but not whoa good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I would wait an hour to eat here, luckily I HAVE NOT had to but needless to say the sushi is just fantastic! I have yet to have a mediocre roll yet after three visits."}
{"text":"My review is only for take out, as I've never stayed and eaten in. I'm not a very experienced sushi eater, and there are still places I have yet to try, but this is the best I've had here in Madison so far. I love being able to pop in after work on my way home and place an order for sushi or maki rolls, and bring them home to delight my kiddos. The atmosphere inside Red Sushi is nice and casually classy. The waitstaff is friendly, swift and efficient. Im able to place an order and leave within just a few minutes. I actually love the presentation and to to-go packaging when ordering just a couple rolls. It's really darling."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service. We were recommended the Volcano, Seven Sins, and a roasted vegan seasonal roll. All were great. Volcano was our favorite. Next time we will try the Super Volcano."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in Madison.  One of the BEST restaurants in Madison overall. Consistently friendly, knowledgeable, professional wait staff.  High quality of seafood is also consistent. Warm and cozy atmosphere.  So far, only one other restaurant in Madison has earned a five star rating from me (see O'Malley's Jet Room)."}
{"text":"The sushi and service were amazing.  Our waiter was very attentive. There was a long wait for a table but totally worth the wait. I highly recommend resos if they have them."}
{"text":"Went to red last night for the first time and I really enjoyed it. There's not much sushi in Madison, so most people go to Muramoto, which is good as well. Red had a more alt vibe - most of the waiters had tats and piercings - but ours did a really nice job. The service was quick and attentive but not pushy, and she was patient when my dad asked a million questions about the menu. 

I liked the menu (although the actual layout was a little confusing) because there's a huge variety of rolls, sashimi and sushi. Thy have lots of traditional and simple rolls, but also have lots of inventive and creative stuff. Easily a couple hundred items on the menu do theres something for everybody. I would highly recommend them Omega-6 as well as the Orange Crunch. We also got simple vegetable tempura which was perfect for 3 people to share. 

In regards to the whole wasabi and ginger issue, it does say in the menu that you will be charged $0.50 for each and that you need to ask, but all of our plates were served with both. The table next to us asked for more and then the server charged them the $0.50, so I think it's only for refills."}
{"text":"Sushi Red is probably our favorite place for sushi in Madison! It is a small space and can get crowded even on a weeknight. They have the system of of texting when your table is ready so we usually walk down a few doors down to one of the bars and grab a drink while we wait.

We've had the opportunity to sit at in their table section as well as the bar and both have been great with service.

They have a nice variety of drinks and sake. The sushi is delicious and there is a lot of different choices. I really enjoy one of the rolls that has duck. It is a little pricey but it is a nice sushi restaurant for a night out or a special occasion."}
{"text":"Oh goodness. So, I can't even remember what the names of the rolls I got were. There was a roll that was seasonal that we got. 

I want to say both of the rolls we got had salmon. This is probably the worst review ever in that I can't remember any details of my sushi other than it was amazing.

I wonder if it was so amazing that I blacked out and can't remember the details. It really was amazing though.

I definitely want to come back here if my wallet allows for it! I feel like I'd want to order all the rolls and try everything."}
{"text":"Moving to Madison from the East Coast, I had decided that sushi in the midwest would be inherently subpar. I could not have been more mistaken. Red sushi is some of the most delicious fish I have ever had. The have some exciting unique rolls along with all of the classics you would expect. The new location has a great vibe and is perfect for date night!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family to celebrate my birthday. The reviews on Yelp are very accurate. The place is beautiful, very elegant, and you don't really feel that you're in Madison. We tried to make a reservation at 4:30, but they were already booked for the night with an hour and a half wait for a table. We sat at the sushi bar and it was really fun watching the sushi chefs make sushi. If we had any questions, we could ask the executive chef who was right in front of us. He was very nice and helpful. The food was excellent. I tried a couple of different raw and cooked rolls along with their ramen. My dad is really picky and only likes tempura, and they were able to accommodate to his liking and serve tempura. The sushi was delicious! It was the best sushi I had in Madison, and even better than the one restaurant that I went to in Vancouver. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had in Wisconsin. Always sit at the sushi bar if you can. The chefs are great if you bring a friend that is uncertain about eating raw fish and will find something they like. The bartenders are great and the fish is delivered fresh (I have seen it being delivered, not something I can claim in other sushi bars in a land locked state) daily. Uni shooters are a must (but ask to substitute sake for the champagne). Fresh Toro is also a nice dish. It gets crowded so either call ahead or be prepared to wait a little bit during lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"The best sushi we have had in Madison- and we love Muramoto. Surf n turf roll was amazing!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, bad attitude. The food is amazing, however the servers have such an attitude. There is always an hour or longer wait if you do not have a reservation. But if you see how many tables are available you could think that they just say it because they want to look it as a popular fancy place. I had the steak tartar, which was amazing! The California roll was delicious too. My fiancé had the ramen and the seaweed salad which where excellent."}
{"text":"Too fancy for its own good! I have been struggling to find a good sushi place that I can count on. Red is like one of those dates that you go on, that you super enjoy, but there's just something missing. I know that Red is going to find the perfect people someday, but our relationship just wasn't mutual. Food was nice, prices were a little arrogant, but it was me and Red's first date so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Although we had a good enough time, and everything looked good on paper, I felt like Red was one of those close talkers, and that's just a deal breaker for me. I could literally bump elbows with Red's other dates that night, which I thought was just unbecoming of such a \"sophisticated\" place. No hate, no shade, it just wasn't meant to be between us. But maybe it's your perfect match!"}
{"text":"The lunch special sashimi lunch 8 pieces(17 small pieces actually) of chef's choice sushi with one small bowl sushi rice $18 and sushi lunch 6 pieces of chef's choice and 1 roll $17 are very very nice. Fresh sashimi with cheap price at noon. Maybe you will argue that why $17 is cheap? My meaning is that it is cheap comparing to the similar sashimi and sushi dinner with $32.
For the roll, I the spicy Godzilla roll the best. Crawfish roll, spicy salmon, eighty-six, duck tempura are all good choices! 
The pork bun with pork belly and kimchi is kind of special. You could try if you love Korean style Japanese food. 
Do not order the ramen here please. It is just very normal maybe even under level ramen from my view."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE red!! Their sushi is soo fresh and their rolls are super tasty and very trendy! The atmosphere is super fun trendy and has great vibes as well!! I highly recommend the lychee martini it's super yummy!! Service is always fabulous as well! Highly recommend to make a reservation, go early, or go later in the evening to avoid the crowd and long wait!"}
{"text":"Great Ramen and great sushi? Yep! And super friendly staff from hostess to server and everyone in between. Nice open view of kitchen and sushi bar; original tasty drinks and amazing menu."}
{"text":"As a vegan, former sushi addict, I've been reluctant to go out for sushi since switching over. I somehow thought that I was losing out on great food and would be consigned to eating sub-par no fish rolls. Wow was I wrong. Red Sushi has a great vegan and veg friendly menu. My girlfriend and I went here for date night and really enjoyed it. I had the vegan roll--as good as veggie sushi gets--and a sun-dried tomato roll. The sun dried tomato roll was good, but a little overwhelming for a full course. I'd recommend splitting it among friends so you don't get overwhelmed by the sun-dried flavor. For drinks, I had the Emperor's Delight (or something like that) which was a very delicious whiskey cocktail. They also have a good (but not amazing) bottled beer selection. 

My girlfriend had the Shellfish Trio, which she informed me was also pretty stellar. 

The place gets crowded and it is small so it gets a tad loud. But I thoroughly enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the cooks work. All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary here, and we agree that RED  is one of the best restaurants in town. Before we walked in, we both expected to be assaulted with that \"grocery store fish counter\" smell, and we were both delighted to find the air completely without that smell. That thought was interrupted by our wide-eyed, slack-jawed automatic responses to the interior. We both marveled at the solid nods to the 1960s--curved banquettes, multi-level frosted sphere pendant light fixtures--and the futuristic, fishbone, samuri finishes and textures. One of the coolest dining rooms in town to eat in, that I can think of. I personally loved the low key electronic dance mix that played that night. At least, my eternal inner dance party did.
Stunned, we made our way to our table, where we were lucky enough to find ourselves in the care of Megan. She is a thoughtful, friendly, funny, and knowledgeable person. She took great care of us and helped make the night truly lovely for us.
The food itself was immaculate. We had a selection of rolls, starting with the \"South of the Border\" and the \"Vegan Rainbow\". Not only were the plates stunning, but both varieties were exciting and surprising in very different ways. The \"Border\" rolls give you the tender sticky rice outside, an avocado topper, chiles and a crunchy rice center. Fabulous. The \"Rainbow\" features a strip of smartly grilled bell pepper, asparagus, avocado, and their genius rice. We could not get enough of these and the sweet soy, wasabi paste and sliced, pickled ginger. Perfection.
We also sampled their cocktails. The bar is most impressive. We can personally recommend the \"Wildflower\", the \"TORO!TORO!TORO!\", and \"The Current Climate,\" which I suspect is a potion intended to help you forget about the current climate for a few precious moments. May Bacchus smile upon all who were involved in the making and delivering of that cocktail. At least twice."}
{"text":"Just visited the new space for lunch today and already made reservations to go back tomorrow!  Did you read that....RESERVATIONS!  The space is stunningly modern and chic, food was just as amazing as the old place (whew)!  The location is a little hard to see from the street and parking is a little lacking but they're going to be offering valet in the evening...score!  If you haven't been to Red in awhile due to the long waits at the old place, make a reservation and GO...and make sure to order the volcano roll!"}
{"text":"Black River sake (cold) was phenomenal, and I'm definitely a hot sake person.
The biggest surprise of the night was the Surf and Turf roll...and I gravitate for the raw rolls. The surf and turf was so delicious and unique. 
Highly recommend to anyone wanting to get some new rolls."}
{"text":"I would say their sashimi is some of the best I have had in the area. We tried the toro (fatty tuna) and the escolar (white tuna) and both were excellent. The toro was on special for ten bucks and we got six decent size pieces.the escolar was fresh tasting and exactly what we were looking for. We ordered three rolls with some mixed reviews. The super volcano and salmon lover were decent but I have had better for less than the $12-$15 each. We enjoyed the lobster tempura but once again that was $15 also. I would think their classic rainbow rolls would be awesome because their fish seemed to be high quality for Madison standards. Wish we would have gotten more sushimi.

We enjoyed the atmosphere because it was still relaxing even though they were slammed. Kind of annoying to wait for over an hour but they will call you when seating is ready and there are plenty of places within half a block to grab an app or drinks or both ,) while you wait."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing- went there after my wedding with my new husband and our parents. Now we go back for all major life events! Incredible food, great friendly staff. Try the surf and turf roll!"}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent, as is the ambiance.  The drinks, however are remarkably weak.  We tried two specialty drinks as well as a couple classics and all were remarkably weak in regards to alcohol content.  Quite disappointing for a $12 cocktail.  Particularly disappointing in light of how good the food is."}
