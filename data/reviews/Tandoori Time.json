{"text":"Been going here for quite some time and this location is better then the Albion one.  Like their kebab rolls and butter chicken."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! I always come here with my best friend when we both are hungry! Each time the experience is new. Excellent food with great customer service. Butter chicken and biryani is to die for! Worth checking into this place!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I'm craving for Indian Food. The food is good and affordable.  We usually order the combo for 2 - butter chicken, chicken biryani, kebob, 4 naan and 2 drinks all for 23$.  The service is fast and servers are friendly. I hope they renovate their washroom."}
{"text":"Amazing food made in an actual clay tandoor oven; family restaurant atmosphere (this place is always packed and there are lots of kids, if that deters you, get your food to go). Authentic North Indian/Pakistani fare, and very flavourful butter chicken. Never had an issue with burnt naans. Salad portions are larger if you order food to go. Honestly, food that is not up to this quality is often priced at double the amount when you're getting Indian food closer to the Toronto core. Decent service, can be on the slow side but again if you're not in the mood for a leisurely meal get your stuff to go and they're very quick about it."}
{"text":"We went in on Sunday for dinner. The restaurant was moderately busy. A lot families. The restaurant decor is basically an old diner converted into a desi restaurant. We were acknowledged and seated in about 5 minutes. There 3 people manning the floor. We were seated but just menu handed out for 8 adults. Had to flag down the waitress for more menus. The waitress did help us decide if the food we ordered was sufficient or not. The service was ok and the food was mediocre too. The only thing that I enjoyed was their butter chicken. Would I go back again? If I'm in the area maybr but not drive out just to eat there."}
{"text":"Went back for a sit down lunch. The Lamb Karahi is to die for and the Shahi Paneer is very delicious.  Services was also fantastic. The only complain is that the Samosa is a bit too greasy and over fried. Nonetheless, love this place. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Lunch special was priced good but quality was poor, kabob was cold, rice was luke warm and still stuck/burnt together. Looked like it was in a rice cooker all day.   Naan was great though,"}
{"text":"The value for the price you pay is definitely worth it! For only $12 (tax included) I got a salad, chicken and naan. Although that doesn't seem like a lot the bowl of chicken is never ending. Also one of the best tender chicken i've ever had!  Definitely will come back and try other menu items"}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  The chef must not be desi as food had no taste.  Diet food taste better than this.  Nihari tasted like water and no taste.  We had plenty of left over food and we did not get anything to go. Very disappointed. If you are hungry get naan and that is it"}
{"text":"Beware when ordering from the specials menu..they charged regular price and then argued it was due to substitutions and additions, both not requested. Food is  greasy on the bland side. Facility is run down...has a grimy feel...will not come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service by our server! Polite, always smiles, keeps checking on us and made sure our food was as specified. The butter chicken, lamb karahi, biriyani and garlic naan here is the best. So is the Mango shake!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5.  I go back only because it is the only decent indian restaurant in the area.  The competition remotely close by sucks!  The food quality is good, inconsistently spectacular but always good and never bad.    Its a small place and I have only dined in once, I usually buy takeout.  Price, its not pricey but when you see the takeout portions, I think its pricey.  Compared to the quality and size of some places in little India, it is very pricey.  They have Haleem and its very good when its fresh!  I do find the flavours and spice slightly tamed...not sure if they tame it on purpose as I am a different culture.  It reminds me of a westernized Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to grab some food. I usually get the combo for two when I go, and thy give you a lot of food. We've never finished it all in one sitting, and for the price it's pretty good.   I like to get the butter chicken or the kebab wrap. The food is flavoured pretty well, and I haven't yet tried something there that I don't like. Also, the fries that come with the kebab wrap are so good, kind of like Popeye fries. They're kind of spicy and crunchy and are completely worth it.   There are a couple of tables there, the last time I was there they were kind of dirty, and the menus we had were dirty too... Not that appealing. The service is just so so, but the food's good."}
{"text":"Food is awesome for the price. However the butter chicken has been consistently spicy even though being in the mild category.   Service is so-so. But for the price and the sparseness of indian restaurants in the area I will be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible! Regardless of how good their food may be if there service isn't good I refuse to go back. I went there a few times to see if maybe it was just that particular day. But their service has always been the same. They take so long to bring your food and if you ask for something else it's like your bothering them. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. There are so many better restaurants with great service and great food! This isn't one of them!"}
{"text":"Food for 4 out of 10 is NOT recommended as it comes small portion for almost same value of taste as a ghetto buffet. Taste isn't perfected yet, sad but true, biryani is portion for two however taste wasn't that amazing. Heart broken with amount of food gone to waste with not made with love. PS do not order chaat papri IS not worth it. Would I return? nope sorry but service lady nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Tandoori time is a great place. Friendly staff, always smiling. Good food. The food is a little americanized, but it's still really good. They have great options for combos for 2 +. Comes with so much food for decent prices. The only thing I suggest to them is allow the food to be a little spicier. Still 5 stars. The price and the amount of food you get is unbeatable."}
{"text":"This here is a decent ~3.5 starts~ restaurant.  Folks we went to try this location during lunch hour. The service was excellent and fast as we were about 10 hungry coworkers.  The food came out relatively quickly as we had called a head.  I tried Fish Tikka Masala which is tandoori fish cooked in a thick spicy sauce with green pepper with salad and rice & as a side I also got delicious beef seekh kabab cooked in a clay oven. The food was cooked well and served hot.  The restaurant has good seating area and their kitchen is open and you can see the person making naans through the glass.   They have parking on site and its priced well.  For my Muslim bothers and sisters - their menu is halal, stated on their site."}
{"text":"I love this place !!! Staff are super friendly and don't bug you like most places. The kimanan is the best in town !!"}
{"text":"First off I've been to many of the Indian cuisine restaurants in Toronto. I decided to try a few in Vaughan too see how authentic the food was.  This place is a small, but cozy dine in and take out spot.  I tried the butter chicken, channa, piratha and garlic naan bread. The food was tasty, but nothing spectacular either. Compared to the other Indian spots around there, their computer system to take orders was a lot more sophisticated then the nearby tandoori spot in the same plaza where they have the owners 13 year old son taking orders on a notepad. The food was not overly spicy and the quantities I had we're a decent size. All in all it was an alright place for lunch. I've gone there twice, but I'd probably check around for more spots if you have the time."}
{"text":"I am only giving 3 star because of service and environment otherwise food is sucks they don't even know how to cook Pakistani food"}
{"text":"Had better.  Been to so many different Indian restaurants and wasn't impressed with their food.  I personally won't return."}
{"text":"Pretty good! It was our first time visiting. Portions are very generous and prices very reasonable compared to other Indian restaurants we go to.  I have to say the standout dish was the Briyani !  I'm not exaggerating when I say it is probabely the best I've ever had ( I've eaten at dozens of South asian restaurants around the planet)  I think it's the caramelized onions and spices that add a nice crispy texture and flavour to the dish ; absolutely delicious!  We will be back to sample the entire menu."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for Pakistani food. The service is outstanding and this is rare in many ethnic restaurants."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. Just like any desi restaurant,  they hate to give you good portion for chatny and salad. Naans are always burned, so every time you have to mention it to them that you will not accept burnt naans. Ask for can of soda if you are planning to have a drink. They tend to push you for fountain version of pop which is absolutely disgusting, as it has no gas and very diluted.  Their seekh kababs, haleem, and lamb biryani deserves two thumbs up. Do not order combos."}
{"text":"I had an allergy: runny nose, puppy eyes so I cant really give a good taste background. Nevertheless, I know it is spicy because that I can distinguish. My husband likes it the spicy-ness. Cheaper than the Indian resto in the Newmarket area. I wish the mango lassi was a bit more sweet. Perhaps I am used to the Asian taste. We had so much to take home. Definitely a bang for your buck. We order palak paneer, fish tikka, beef kaobob, veg samosas, and masala tea"}
{"text":"My go-to for indian. Im a regular, I often dine here or do take out. Their new management, a young lady who often sports a blazer, is great. shes professional, quick and does her job well. I've witness her handle very obnoxious, rude and immature customers who have caused a scene (yelling, insulting, throwing furniture) and she handled it super well! She stood up for the restaurant and her staff. That is a huge plus to me. On another note, the food is consistent, great price and i occasionally see the owner here. he seems like a nice man who interacts with customers, and works on the job.  I love this place ! keep it up tandoori , you guys have vastly improved.  The only down side is that since it is a small establishment, professionalism isnt the greatest forte from the servers but thats just my two cents."}
{"text":"Excellent value for money. Their chicken tikka is the best I've had in the GTA regardless of price. The chicken biryani is also something I come back for time and time again. We usually take out but they have just refurbished the dining room. Good service and prompt food."}
{"text":"Can't rate food but can rate their songs  playback ... 5 star. Experiencing 4th time food is also good. 6th visit Again songs are killing . 7th visit same songs are still touching heart. Environment is also pleasuring"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant twice. My first experience was pleasant so I returned with a group of friends. The food was very good, however we all ended up sick for about a week. Another friend of mine and her family were also ill and I found out she had eaten here as well around the same time we did! Too bad because their food was very good."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout while driving to Toronto from the cottage. Pretty good Pakistani food. Haleem was a little bland but butter chicken was tasty. Bread was very fluffy and good. Medium spice was right on- my kids could eat it no problem.  Solid, not earth shattering."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how ecstatic I was to find authentic Pakistani food so close to Vaughan. The interior was well-appointed and clean, the staff was prompt and helpful, I got a lot more for the money, and the food was just exceptional. They also take more forms of payment than a lot of places in, say, Brampton :-) I highly recommend the nihari it is exquisite and spot-on. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Looking at a fellow co-workers take-out container which was apparently from the day before, he told me it was from Tandoori Time so OKAY I'll go check it out sometime, which was lunch the same day.  Somewhat hidden but I've passed by it quite often I went into a dining area that is large enough that'll work with a SINGLE serving staff, she asked if we wished to take-out or dine-in.  Seeing as there are other few tables, we decided to eat in but as we sat through-out there were people coming in to pickup their orders to-go.  More people of the same culture as this restaurant coming for food had to stand for some POSITIVE points, an btw my co-worker is the same background as well.  We were given a regular menu but a LUNCH SPECIAL menu doesn't hurt and a bit over my lunch budget price range but nonetheless gotta give it a try.  Butter Chicken($9.99) took awhile and understandably because they are small scale staffed but as well we were behind a BIG take-out order.  Lunch does take some time so don't come if you're in a rush unless you call in for a take-out order.  It was some delicious Butter Chicken(Butter, Tomato Sauce, Cream) with some spices I usually don't see from my little experiences of the same dish.  The dish was categorized under CURRIES and it did have a slight kick that works for people that like medium spicy.  The sauce was great for dipping the NAAN and the Chicken pieces were very tender.  I had the Onion Salad which was A-OK."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been a customer at their various locations for 10 years and the food is consistently great.  I love the variety of their dishes and I like that naan or rice and raita is included with every dish.  I specifically love the kabobs, the seafood dishes, the chili chicken, and the biryanis.  The food is a mix of Indian and Pakistani so the dishes are a little different than traditional Indian fare.  I have recommended this place to many people and they all love it!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken is the best! So delish! The waitress recommended it, and I'm so thankful. I haven't had this Pakastani dish in 20 years since I had it a an old Pakastani friend's house as a kid visiting London. It's what made me fall in love with the closest thing to it, Indian food. It was just as good, and my mom and uncle loved the fish tika masala. I tried a bite and it was crazy flavorful. I'm not even a big fish fan."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning. I think the lamb biryani was suspect. The chicken karhai was also questionable."}
{"text":"First off I don't know how burnt the Naan bread was with some people but I could kind of see what they meant but I wouldn't whine too much about that because it could easily be chipped off. Not a big deal.  Wipe your tears and move on.  The food we ordered was decent I got some ground beef kabob and my friend got butter chicken.   Kabob was good but the butter chicken wad weak in flavour.    Service was slow and this girl looked lost the whole time. So God help her. Lol"}
{"text":"This strip mall family place delivers unexpectedly good food.  The chicken tikka masala was outstanding, and the lamb curry had layers of flavour. Beef kabobs were nicely charred on the outside and yet still moist.  Onion salad was nothing special, but wasn't really needed."}
{"text":"You can't beat a Non Veg Thali for $9.  I'm used to paying closer to $14 at Bombay Bhel, so at that price I had to give it a try.  I went in with limited expectations.  Service was good, and my Thali was delivered to my table in just a few minutes.  Clearly the food was prepared beforehand, but it was still good for only $9. If I had one complaint, it was that the Naan was drier than others, but I am becoming a Naan snob, so I am the first to notice when the Naan is not up to MY standards.  Anytime I crave a fast, inexpensive lunch in the area, I would certainly return."}
{"text":"Tandoori Time is a darn good Indian restaurant with the usual dishes. A favorite, of course, is butter chicken, but surprisingly you might want to try the chicken wings. Really good!"}
{"text":"Been there few time, good service and food, not too spicy. Kebabs, biryani, butter chicken all superb. Was disappointed with fried samosas, bhajias."}
{"text":"Came across this place while at Canada's wonderland. We went to St Louis and were told booths are for 4 or more people, so we walked out and came to tandoori time. Had the butter chicken which was great. Only downfall is it comes with either naan or rice, it should come with both."}
{"text":"We went here with some family friends for a late lunch/early dinner. It was not busy and service was good.  We had ordered the biryani and lamb curry with naans. They were done very well."}
{"text":"Bland.. i ordered take out for keema and alloo naan. I specifically mentioned i want extra spicy. Still food turned out to be very bland. Packing waa really really bad. Bag was openes and as i pulled it out from my car couple of naan's fell out and they were not properly covered in foil so got dirty and unedible. Reading comment; had high expectations and i waa very very disappointed with the quality of food."}
{"text":"Good food. Service started good until later. When we were almost done with the food, server was coming every 5 minutes to ask if we are done. Twice she tried to take the half eaten butter chicken until the second time I had to raise my voice and remind her that I am still eating. Food is good. But could definitely improve the server's attitude. Would prefer takeout next time."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience.  The food was 4/10 so not worth going back after the bad service we experienced. We had 6 in our party and only 1 other table with only one gentleman dining. However our server seemed very flustered and confused.  We ordered off the lunch menu but it all went downhill from there. They forgot my colleagues veggie Buriyani, it took an hour to get to her. In meantime she was nibbling on our dishes so she ended up packing it. When we asked her \"where is her dish\" 3 times she responded \"it's coming, veggie takes long\"  but the the chicken Buriyani came 30 min ago. Two of thali dishes that were ordered came 35 min after ordering. This is not acceptable when office folk are on an 1 hr lunch break. She didn't apologize or acknowledge once that they slipped up. Instead made excuses and pointed out that our friend was in fact taken care of because she was nibbling on our food, that was not acceptable nor the point. We were all really frustrated with the service at this point and when we all paid and got up to leave she stood in front of us and asked us to tip her. !!!!!!! I have never experienced that ever.  It was horrible service and she wasn't tipped for a reason. Neath Less to say we will never go back there again, there are other great Indian restaurants in the area with better food and definitely better and quick service."}
{"text":"Great food and flavour and reasonable prices. Would recommend the curries and naan. Love coming here when I'm in the Vaughan area!"}
{"text":"I give Tandoori time a 4 only because majority of he time they mess something up on the order lol it doesn't deter us from ordering food, but always check your food before leaving to make sure it's correct.  The service is super slow but they're friendly people. We've learned to always order ahead and get fake out! The naan is amazing and butter chicken is better than any I've ever had."}
{"text":"My family and I always go here because it's so convenient and affordable. Great prices for the quality. We always get the special for 2 and it's enough to feed 3 people. Portions can be a little small but food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant!  I've ordered take out on two separate occasions for lunch. I've ordered their palak paneer and the haleem, both with rice & naan and made mild. I have to say, the palak paneer could have been better. It was way, way, way too spicy for my likings, even when made mild. I have a feeling someone bunged up that order cause the devil himself couldn't have enjoyed that order. I bet you're reading this and wondering why I'm giving it a 4 star? It's because the haleem was great! So tasty and made mild to my likings. Fresh ginger and green chilies to be added, crispy onions on top and a nice beef blend to warm your soul.  The restaurant is rather large and they play some good authentic music too. I wish I asked which CD they were playing. Maybe next time since I know I'll be returning.  UPDATE: I've been returning here for lunch on many, many occasions. The palak paneer is where it's at! Since reviewing in April 2015 (now Sept 2015), they've corrected the situation and I can eat happily and less on fire."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I know.  Sometimes I have to wait awhile for the food but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious - lamb kababs were super tender and fully flavoured. My dinner for one was great value and good sized portion, rice, three pieces of naan and butter chicken for $12!!  Service was lovely - my female server was super friendly, helpful in giving advice about food and beer. No complaints here.  Ambiance was alright, I sat by a window, which was nice, a view of Jane street, not bad. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, and I was delighted by the friendly service. Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Tandoori time since it was just  a square room with a glass wall wher eyou could see the cooks sticking naan into their clay oven... forward to 15 years later..and they 've managed to maintain their same recipes along with the 2 extra extensions of their locale. Having said that I only go back for Their  chicken tikka with naan and rice..juicy flavorful and fresh off the grill super moist chicken chunks and colorful spiced rice. Fries and onion salad too.  I hop they don't change as I would hate to go on a quest for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"We came during Ramazan. Food was mediocre (minus the naans) but the service was horrible. We were missing a salad and our drinks came when were finished our meal... Then we got overcharged for our drinks and the management tried to argue with us about it."}
{"text":"Do not go here people. It is extremely dirty extremely unsanitary place. The least to say the service is horrible. We came here to eat placed our order and the table was not functioning and the girls wouldn't let us change tables. Dude your giving service to people learn it."}
{"text":"No frills restaurant with reasonable prices and great service. The menu is pretty extensive and they will accommodate you on how spicy you want the food to be. A great spot for a quick lunch. It was my first time and I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered fish tikka masala, malai kofta with garlic naan.. The food was cooked well and tasted authentic and fresh.. But the service was too bad.. Just because of food, I am rating an extra star.. No clean plates, no water refills, and the waiters were not even coming to check in.."}
{"text":"My cousins brought me to this restaurant when I was visiting Canada. They kept raving about how good the food was so they brought me to witness for myself. I must admit, I'm happy I tried it out. The food was very delicious. It was definitely authentic Indian Food.  We started off with Chana, which is a combination of chick peas,  sweet yet spicy chutney (sorry, I don't know the actual name of the chutney) and yogurt.  It was a ray of flavors in my mouth. I loved it!   For my main course, I got the butter chicken with naan. The chicken was tender and succulent. The portion was huge. It was so good  that I finished all of it. The naan was very different than the typical naan you get at other Indian restaurants. You can tell it had just come out of the oven or as Indian's like to call it the ''tandoor\". Usually naan is a little greasy, but this naan was not greasy at all.   The restaurant kind of looked like a fast food restaurant. I liked the fact that it was very clean. The service was good and prompt. I'm bummed we don't have a restaurant like this in Los Angeles. =("}
{"text":"I've been going to Tandoori Times in Rexdale for a very, very long time. Their portions are terrible for what you're paying. The only good thing is the Lunch thali. Definitely the only reason it works is because it's the only decent Indian/Pakistani restaurant in the area. Servers are different every time I go there. It might be because of the poor customer service. I've personally experienced rude employees, even while placing take- out orders, over the phone. Not worth a visit."}
{"text":"Correction to description: it is a PAKISTANI restaurant, not Indian as described to be.  Been here many times and plan to go many more times in the coming days and years. I am not aware of a better Pakistani restaurant in all of the GTA. It is simply the best. Don't take my word, just try it and if you don't like it don't go back.  The chicken karhai is boneless and delicious. As are the aaloo naans, beef kababs, chilli chicken, and you name it. Desert menu is good, though not great, but still better than any comparable restaurant, that is unless you goto a dessert specialty, which would obviously be better.  All other locations are just as good. The Toronto one expanded its size twice. I have also been to one of the Mississauga ones. The Maple one is small and they should acquire more capacity soon.  All above is my opinion. Feel free to agree or disagree, though I sense you will tend to agree."}
{"text":"First time here after reading the reviews. Food was fresh and great tasting, I've have had good Indian food in the past but had to travel quite a distance from Vaughan to get the good stuff. Now I have a place to go close to home! what else can I say that was not said...good food and good price."}
{"text":"My husband and I always get the combo for 2. It's quite a bit of food, enough to take home. I love the butter chicken ask for it spicy... Amazing. Overall good food for the entire family and its halal!"}
