{"text":"We were sad to see Ciccio Sanwiccio close but excited when we saw this Latin American place take its place.  Strengths: Food made fresh  Nice presentation  Adds to the variety in the area Clean interior Nice signage and menu Friendly staff  Room for improvement in these areas: Seasoning - Our chicken bowl and Carnitas arepa were very salty, arepa was quite greasy  Quantity - we weren't expecting Chipotle portions but felt the serving size was a bit small for the price   All in all, I plan to return as these issues may get worked out in time. Still worth giving this new business a try!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing carne mechada arepa at Maiz a couple weeks ago. Had to write a review because the tenderness and flavour of the shredded beef was unparalleled to other arepas in town. I've been to many places around Toronto to try their arepas and this place was by far my favourite! Service was also very good, there were not many people sitting in the restaurant when we went but there were many mobile orders and take out orders while we were there.  Their guasacaca was the best I have had. loved it. Some kind of delicious cheese covered the arepa's opening. This made it less visually appealing.. but the taste with all of that cheese was amazing!   Also, they gave bon bon bum suckers with our receipt, which was a delicious bonus! We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Prices are really high - the guacamole, at $12, is an extremely small bowl.  Chicharron arepa held a much more substantial and generous portion of thick, crispy slabs of bacon, and the accompanying coleslaw was nice to cut through all the pork fat.  The best part was the garlic aioli, which comes in a squeeze bottle so you can add as much as you'd like to your tastes.  My partner was more disappointed in his barbacoa arepa, and said there was very little meat filling inside.  Nothing in particular draws me back..."}
{"text":"I had the Canitas Arepa and it was stuffed to the brim with ingredients. The carnitas were well prepared but the star of the show was the salsa. It seems each arepa gets its own unique one. Their michelada was great too, although it contained no hot sauce or Clamato. Frankly it didn't need any. It also came with a spicy piece of tamarind candy. I'll be back to try the rest of their meats.   The presentation was great. This is not your typical Toronto Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but ended up just liking it. I did take out on the burrito and tacos and found the food too westernized. I have a lot of experience with Mexican living in the US so I was hoping to find a local place that can deliver the greasy goodness at a good price. It's not bad, just tamed down in terms of flavour."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food I had. Very basic tacos and arepa done perfectly ! Please have the shredded beef arepa ! It's out of this world . So tender, juicy and flavourful! The sauce was also highly addictive! You gotta check this hidden gem out!"}
{"text":"Food: The appetizers were cool and possibly the best thing about this place. Though, I should say they were quite greasy. Also, the portions were surprisingly small for the price.   Drinks: cocktails were disappointing. Served in small glasses which were half ice. Couldn't detect a trace of alcohol in there.   Service: friendly and attentive but quite pushy. Our server pushed us to order more food multiple times.   Atmosphere: casual and lively. I'd say it's best for small groups and singles."}
{"text":"This place was alright. My favourite part about my meal was the drink (raspberry mojito!). The tacos were meh, especially the steak one, it wasn't very good at all. They advertise having the best guac in town, but the portion is small and nothing amazing, plus the chips could definitely be seasoned better. I did like the chorizo queso tho. Lastly, service was not very good at all...so that's that."}
{"text":"All I can say is FINALLY! Fun cool delicious organic with a huge gluten free selection... what more could you want!? This hood needed a fresh young vibrant place with good energy. Even better the beautiful cocktails! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped by this recent Latin restaurant that opened up in the Yonge and Lawrence area, few minutes away from my place. The place has a nice decor but it's very small. This used to be Ciccio Sandwich which I came a few times. The layout appears to be the same.   I had the 3 tacos for $12 special. It has to be the same filling though. Otherwise the tacos are $5 for one. I chose the Carnitas (Pork) which was good and added the Oaxaca cheese for an extra 0.50 cents. However, they are a bit small in size and a bit oily. The Pork was very tasty though.   I'll come back again as I want to try the Arepas next."}
{"text":"Awesome arepas-chicken is my favourite along with their papelon drink. Their tortilla soup is delicious and addictive, especially during the long winter we have had.  Friendly and usually quick service with a great vibe.  Recommend reservations in the evening since it is a small space. They recently opened and has quickly become one of the busiest spots in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Been here once so far and couldn't be more excited at having a place that serves arepas quite close to me here in North York! Vibes of the place are pretty chill and it wasn't too busy when I came for lunch on Friday which meant there was room for my daughter in her stroller (#momlife). I ordered the arepa pabellon which was delicious with the beef, black beans, cheese and fried plantains making a jam packed arepa. I had also ordered a chicken empanada to start and while I was s fan of the crispy fried shell I was less than impressed that the chicken filling was kind of cold (but at least it was cooked) and dry. They have more than just arepas so I'd like to come back to try more!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Maiz multiple times and the food is always good, but inconsistent. Sometimes they send avocado crema and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they put toppings and sometimes they don't. They've messed up my orders a few times as well, but the food has always been good.   Today, i bit into my chicken empanada and I coouldn't swallow because there was something poking me. It was a small bone. But my churros were good."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Cozy place with very good food! Nice music! I ordered tacos with chorizo and beef really good!  and the tequeños was so good as well. My suggestion is the tequeños can be more big not to small. And have more variations of coffee! I recommend the place and Definitely I come back to try the desserts!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I tried the Cheese empanada and papellon empanada, both really really good! Crispy on the outside and yummy on the inside. Then ordered a Chorizo Arepa, which was absolutely amazing. For drinks, we ordered house wine and classic Michelada. The price is great and environment too! Super recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a nice place! The food was amazing, great service and music, we'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We had the chorizo bowl and la tostada. Portions were big and my la tostada was delicious. The pulled pork was flavourful and the arepa frita was crispy. The cheese and creamy slaw was cut well with pickled onions and jalapeños. The chorizo bowl was flavourful and big. We had to order churros after our meal. All the sauces, including the dulce de leche tasted house made."}
{"text":"Every time I passed by this place, I saw lots of people sitting in and enjoying themselves. Finally, I decided to check it out for dinner.  The atmosphere and the decor are really nice and inviting.  I ordered a beef burrito for myself, and my partner ordered three tacos.  The burrito came with a grilled cob of corn, and it tasted really grilled and delicious.  Loved the cheese that came the the tacos, real artisanal stuff, The meat was really tender.  None of that processed, mass-produced mediocre stuff.  They had imported Mexican drinks and an authentic sugar cane drink made in-house.  The service was impeccable, our server was really friendly and attentive but not overbearing.  A lovely addition to the meal was the real habanero sauce from peppers imported from Mexico, as explained to us by the chef, and I am assuming the owner of the place.  I had a really great time and will definitely come back!."}
{"text":"First look and it looks like an authentic Mexican/Latin place. But it gets better. It's an authentic Venezuelan restaurant. And it's as authentic as it can get. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. They explained how each dish, from the dips to the meals are different from other Mexican restaurants. The Chicken arepas, wrapped in corn bread with a side of roast corn was ridiculously amazing. And one is enough though it looks small. Nachos are crisp and fresh. The sugar cane juice is pure without any added flavour. The price is worth every penny. The service is gravy. I can't wait to come back again and again to try everything else."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. I'm a fan! The tortillas were divine, the salsa tasted fresh and was bursting with flavor, and the meat was excellently flavored and tender. We had the Camaronilla al Tequila (shrimps with tequila Habanero salsa, coleslaw, rice & warm tortillas @$19, a plate of 3 Birria tacos (shredded beef) @$12 (added cheese and guac for $0.50 extra each), and a beef burrito @$12. Everything was delicious! Reading the reviews on Yelp makes me want to go back to try the arepas and empanadas. The proteins here are really fresh and stand apart (organic, hormone & antibiotic-free). We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican / Latin American food, mostly of the street type variety (tacos, arepas, burripos and churros for dessert).  Shredded beef arepa was especially good.  Rather tiny seating area and a winter visit resulted in a cold environment, evidently due to lack of insulation or a double door.  Friendly and helpful service.  A bit pricey, probably due to location in a high-rent area."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place & it was decent. The place was very clean & the decor was nice. Considering the hot weather outside they had their air condition on blast which was great. Our server was nice & attentive. Between my boyfriend & I we ordered nachos to share & two tacos each, two chicken & two beef. The portion for the nachos were surprisingly really small. It also came with a salad which we thought was weird. The nachos were alright, the corn tortilla chips had no taste & I would of preferred less of the chihuahua cheese & a lot more of the pico de gallo & sour cream. We weren't a fan of their soft taco shell. Both tacos didn't taste that great. The chicken taco had a little spice in it & aside from that I thought it tasted similar to the beef taco.. It's a small place with limited seating & street parking may be difficult depending on the day and time. Overall, our experience was alright."}
{"text":"Such cute, intimate space with good food! We've decided to order all the churro flavours in their menu."}
{"text":"I don't get why Maiz doesn't get more buzz in Toronto's food scene. It consistently delivers really good Latin food. I've been here a few times and especially like their:  - Arepas: just the right amount of maize taste and perfect thickness so it doesn't overpower whatever filling you choose (beef/chicken/pork/cheese) - Burritos: massive and hearty - Camaronilla al tequila: a really tasty main shrimp dish  In my most recent trip to Maiz, I discovered they now serve brunch and so was excited to see whether it was as good as their dinner menu. My wife and I got: - Pabellón Criollo: This is essentially the breakfast size of the same dinner dish. The shredded beef was tasty as usual, the cotija cheese contrasted well against the black beans, and the fried plantains added a nice sweet pop to the meal. - Huevos Rancheros: Maiz's take on this staple breakfast item was expectedly good. The arbol and guacacaca sauces they used added a nice kick to the meal, and differentiated it from other standard huevos rancheros you can get elsewhere. - Surprise dessert: We decided to be a bit adventurous and passed on the churros to get the house special dessert (with the menu imploring: \"take the risk and let us amuse you\"). It ended up being fried guava+cheese with a creamy dip, which had a really good sweet/savoury mix. Glad we took the risk! - Coffee: Bland and generic.  One other thing: While the service was great (Alex was attentive and we're glad he convinced us to get the surprise dessert), Maiz has gotten my bill wrong a couple of visits now (once overcharged, once undercharged), so make sure to double check it before you go.  Overall, a definite staple in my Toronto food scene, and will go back to try out more of their brunch menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in our neighborhood. The service and the food are top notch and the experience is unmatched in that part of the street. The arepas are my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"Maze is the best restaurant by far in our neighborhood. The service is very sweet and accommodating and the atmosphere is wonderful to too. Everything on their menu is fantastic, but particularly their empanadas."}
{"text":"Amazing. Found this little gem along Yonge and Lawrence area.   Food & Drinks ALL of the following food items I've tried and recommend:   Empanada- 3x for $~12. Got the cheese. Crispy on the outside. Cheesy goodness on the inside. Heavy but YUM!!!! The dip compliments it well.    Tortilla soup- $9? So hearty, rich and full of flavour.   Arepa- $12 shredded chicken & cheesy! Yum! Signature arepa is delightful! Very evenly flavoured. Yum. Get it! The corn arepa is well put together! Filling.   Tacos- $5 per taco. Authentic. Flavourful. Recommend the steak one! Mmm and minus well addd the cheese & guac for $1.50 extra!  No creo en nada- churro, brownie, vanilla ice cream yumminess. Mmmm their churros are to die for. Would definitely recommend this. (If you're too full, must try their churros).   Drink - Mango Michelada - a fun mix of beer, Lime juice, tajin, gummy worms, amazing spices. Yum! Huge drink! So worth it. Has a Cesar spicy kick to it.  Atmosphere- authentic! Suiting for the food.    Parking - pay for parking on the streets parallel. Tough to find but well worth it. $3.00 an hour.   Service - really good. Alert. Very respectable. Explains menu well. Great service!"}
{"text":"The churros...so fresh, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with tasty house made dulce de leche. They also have amazing mixed drinks and beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"This little gem is a great place for a cute intimate date. The food was delicious and presentation was good. Portions are not big, so expect to order a few items on the menu to share.   I recommend getting the arepitaz. They look like little macaroon crispy sandwiches and you get to try out the different meats that they offer. The pulled pork was my favourite. I recommend getting pork and beef over the chicken, which might be a tad dry and not as flavourful. The tacos were ok, nothing special about it that stands out. They didn't have any fish options. The menu does offer gluten free options.   They have a drinks menu with lots of options for cocktails and slushies. The Mango mojito was absolutely delicious, I highly recommend. There's a dessert menu dedicated to churros. We ordered the Banana Split. The portion was bigger than expected and we couldn't finish it with two people. The churro was amazing. Get this if you have a sweet tooth. If you're not big on sweets, it might be too heavy for you.   The atmosphere made the dining experience extra special. Great Latin music sets the mood, combined with touches of cute decor and candle lit tables. Waiters are friendly, attentive, and provided great suggestions for the menu. Would definitely go back for dinner. It's also a great option if you want to just do drinks!"}
{"text":"I think that this place has some good flavours but their a lot of their food is basic and over priced.   Their burrito/burrito bowl is very basic looking, like chipotle but with less toppings. They had enchiladas for $16 which is typical, but it came with no sides. Who wants that?   I got the Pabello Criollo, it was the best dinner option I thought. It is more of a complete meal with beans, rice and a salad. Their salad was just lettuce with some shredded carrot and no dressing. The shredded beef was good as well as the rice and beans. Overall it was average, nothing blew me away. Also their guac was good but such a tiny portion, and no complimentary chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients makes all the difference. The BEST black bean and rice I've ever had. The chicken had wonderful layers of flavours that complimented the rice , paired with shaved lettuce with a hint tangy lime dressing really pleased my taste buds. Well priced, generous portions in charming rustic interior. It's small, but mighty, and made with Love."}
