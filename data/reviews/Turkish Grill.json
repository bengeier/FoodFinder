{"text":"I went today for lunch with my husband and son. the place from outside was not encouraging! when we went inside, however, we changed our minds. very nice decoration (simple turkish designs) with nice turkish music in the background.  the service was good and quickly.  we took: Hummus (good) - lentil soup (very yummy especially with lemon and black pepper) - Grilled Kofte (which came with rice, salad, and something like rice but orange! all of them were tasty. the meat were cooked to perfection) - turkish manti ( good but a little bit sour; I think it should come like this ! this is my first time trying this food)- also we took bread (which was amazing, fresh and crispy ) and 2 soft drinks.   the serving size were generous for the soup and main dishes but little bit small for the hummus.  after eating, we had a turkish tea ( without request or charge) and a candy to my son.  the bill was around 40 $ without the tip.   one disadvantage is that the wash room is in the under level and you have to use the stairs, however their stairs are not comfortable and anyone could fall easily especially kids!   definitely I am going back :)"}
{"text":"Not bad, but nothing special. I'd say even pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Finest Turkish cuisine I have been able to find in Toronto. The food is very fresh and delicious. The staff is very friendly. The interior design of the restaurant is delicate and traditional. Although it is not in a common neighbourhood, it is truly a gem waiting to be found.  UPDATE: The management has changed recently and the service is not as good as it used to be. Nonetheless, it is still has delicious food."}
{"text":"Quite tasty, a nice spot for lunch while at work.  I came in here when I was looking for a pho place (the business was closed). I was hungry, and was unsure of what to get. The server helped me out and I ordered the Adana Shish Kebab. I got the container back to work and was happy with the huge portions of salad, rice and bulgur. It also came with two kebabs, which were flavoured very well, but a little dry. The rice and bulgur were AMAZING. Perfectly flavoured. The rice is usually my favourite part of a Middle Eastern meal.  The dining room was very clean, almost fancy. I might dine in next time if I can convince a coworker to join me.   I'll definitely be back the next time I'm craving Turkish food and I'm at work."}
