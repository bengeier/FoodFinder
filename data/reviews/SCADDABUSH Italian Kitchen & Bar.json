{"text":"Big fan of this place. I love the decor and the atmosphere. The food is very well priced (under 20 bucks for most dishes) and the food is phenomenal ( I always get roasted chicken and spaghetti ... Also tiramisu was delish!) All in all its one of my fav spots to eat in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I've been pretty picky about Italian but have to say that the food here was great! I got the Arabbiatta...not oily, nicely spicy, didn't leave me with a heavy, what did I just eat feeling. Our waitress was really nice as well & the place was surprisingly busy for a Sunday night. 

I did not like the mojito at all though. ...more like a heavily diluted drink with a sad looking mint leaf inside. 

All in all, good experience!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place. From the Quality of food to the price, it's all amazing. The wine comes in 9 oz. glasses which is fantastic and their \"made in house\" mozzarella is delicious.
I highly recommend the bruschetta, ossu buccu bites, and of course... meatballs. The stuffed is good if you like pepperoni, but I prefer them traditional.
Downside? Always taste the wine if you order by the glass. I had an over aged wine served to me twice, but they happily opened a new bottle for me.
Also I'm not sure if it's just me and my phone but I have NO reception in there. Like zero. But that's obviously not their fault.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Nice spacious restaurant with great service! Usually I have an entire review to post but this restaurant had everything you're looking for in an authentic Italian restaurant. 

I ordered the Brick Chicken Spaghetti and it was awesome. The service was slightly slower because the kitchen was backed up due to a small surge. However, once the food came it was finger licking good and I definitely recommend you stop here without hesitation. Our waitress was prompt and very nice! 

This is the place to be on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I think I've had almost everything on the menu. Scaddabush is delicious and my go to place. Such a nice and fun environment . 
A must try if you haven't been here before !"}
{"text":"I really like it. Three visits and three fairly consistent meals. The Buffalo Mozzarella apps are delicious and the Arrabiata is spicy as hell but so good. Great servers, great place to be."}
{"text":"OMG THIS FOOD IS AMAZING!
It really necessitates all caps. 
Mozzarella is to die for and made in house! I strong recommend splurging and getting the one that comes with the fig jam. But you really can't go wrong with any of the choices. 
Charity Bread is also delicious, it is smart to order this as bread is not provided and the proceeds go to a good cause. 
I have ordered several things on the menu (pasta, meatballs, pizza) and have no complaints. Pasta is made in house, so fresh!
Service is wonderful, atmosphere is relaxed. Great location. 
If you visit Toronto and do not check this place out you are making a mistake."}
{"text":"Food is really good and finally fits the price that is charged (unlike too many pretentious and overpriced restaurants in Toronto). The mozzarella is made in-house and great to try."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Price: 4/5

The restaurant had a mix of hipster and rustic decor going on which looked nice and confusing at the same time. We didn't make any reservations but it was at around 2pm so the restaurant was rather empty. We were quickly escorted to a booth with menus. The restaurant also had a bar area where people could watch sports. Overall the restaurant was very big and spacious.

We decided to share a few things to share between the three of us, and the first thing that we ordered was bruschetta. It's one of my favourite Italian dishes and you really can't go wrong with it! The bruschetta was delicious and quite filling too - I believe we ordered the large size for the 3 of us which ended up being more than enough. I remember loving the balsamic vinegar on top!

We next ordered a seafood pasta, one of our all time favourites, and the small size was bigger in portion that we thought! The seafood in the pasta was very fresh and overall it was a nice dish.

The baked carbonara was something new that we tried...and we all loved it! Carbonara is truly a classic Italian dish, but when it's baked, it's so much better! I loved how there was the baked egg on top. It definitely was a bit different from the classic Carbonara but it overall was a great choice.

Scaddabush at Square One is a great restaurant to visit with family and friends on a casual night out. It's not 100% romantic but it's still a place I'd go with my husband for a casual date to enjoy ourselves after a movie or a shopping spree. If you live in Toronto, check out their downtown location!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for his birthday and it was truly excellent. We had the naked  mozzarella as an appetizer and it was truly divine! I like that they post daily who the fresh Mozzarella make is that day and hats off to Kevin! For dinner I ordered a small arabiate and a small caesar salad.  My husband ordered the lobster spaghetti. The pasta is made fresh daily and you really can taste a difference. I also was surprised at the amount of Lobster that came with my husbands portion of pasta. Finally the wait staff brought out a free dessert for my husband for his birthday. It did not taste like a day old lets just get rid of this for this guys birthday dessert either. The service was excellent and the atmosphere of the place was great too. I really liked the vintage industrial decor as well."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family last night. Everybody loved it! The ambience was perfect, although as an older gent, the music was a bit loud for really comfortable conversation. But that is a quibble!

The service was very lively and informative and the food was delicious and distinctive. Not your average 'Italian' restaurant. 

Appetizers were 'on point' but maybe a tiny bit smaller than hungry out-of-towners could have hoped for...? At the same time though, realize that we all left stuffed, with doggy bags in tow.

Charity bread is like some kind of oily, salty, garlicy candy or savoury dessert... fresh mozzarella with tomato and fig jam was sensational... zutta pasta (butternut squash ravioli with hazelnut cream sauce) is an amazing taste experience... also almost a dessert... but good! 

Wonderfully relaxed and comfortable ambience with lots of, \"You have to taste this!\" and \"Can I have a bite of that?\", sharing experience and perspectives. 

\"We'll be back\" - to paraphrase Arnold..."}
{"text":"Went here with three of my friends for one of my friends' grad party. The food was great! For my appetizer I had the mozzarella and for my main I had the spaghetti and stuffed meatball, both did not disappoint. They even brought out a special something for my friend who was graduating, which was so sweet! It totally made her day. I can't wait to go back again. Definitely a step up from Alice Fazoolis!"}
{"text":"Came back for a third try and I think that third try is the charm. 

Food: 5/5
Came here for pasta 3 times and I have to say that my latest try was the absolute best. They managed to cook the pasta right and they were plentiful on the sauce. The charity bread with cheese was also super nice. 

Service: 5/5
Our food took a really long time, so the server and manager came by to apologize and gave us free champagne. They were truly professional. 

Wait: 1/5
The time it took for the food was quite a bit longer, especially since we ordered off the summerlicious menu. Between our apps and our mains I think it took 45 mins to 1 hour. At which the server and manager came over and apologized. 

Overall I think this place is a bit of a toss up. Get it on a good day and you're golden but on an off day then .. Be warned."}
{"text":"Staff are generally very friendly and genuine and they give good menu suggestions when you ask for it. The food is great too! I've tried:
-- Bruschetta with avocado and goat cheese
-- Baked carbonara 
-- Crusted Snapper

Tastes fresh and the textures are perfect."}
{"text":"The revamping was absolutely fantastic.. No sign of the fazooli ghost. They have awesome fresh cheese here. I thought the portions would be a tad bit larger. Food tasted great ..going back again to checkout the patio!"}
{"text":"If you are searching for the very fresh pasta, this is the place for you. Good service also."}
{"text":"I've been to this location over a dozen times and I am never disappointed. Their mozzarella and prosciutto platters are to die for. The pizza is delicious and their osso buco bites are mouth watering. You should also try the grilled cheese and prosciutto sandwich. Yumm!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Without doubt, the worst service I have ever had. Drinks took between 30-40 minutes to arrive... Service was incredibly slow. By the looks of things, this restaurant doesn't seem to turning things around. Would not recommend to others / repeat myself."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick cocktail, or a delicious dinner.  My girlfriends and I are always booking our girls get togethers at Scaddabush!"}
{"text":"Great food every time. Been here enough that I have the menu memorized and know what I'm going to order before I even get there. Service was better a while back, but the restaurant has gotten busier so service has slowed down. Be prepared for a long wait and a loud atmosphere on weekend evenings. Recommend sangria, mozzarella ball, and pesto chicken pasta"}
{"text":"So we went here after hearing some pretty good reviews from a few friends.  We were here last weekend and the parking lot was packed as this restaurant is across the street from Square One shopping mall. 

Parking:   There is ample parking and we found a spot even during the crazy Christmas shopping season.

Drinks: Drinks were very yummy, we had a Blueberry martini and it totally hit the spot! We ordered 2 rounds of the same. 

Decor: The decor is really awesome and eclectic, liked the way it looked rustic and modern at the same time.

Service: Service was great, right from the hostess to our server.  Everyone was polite and answered any questions we had. Server didn't always know the answer to our questions but he made sure he got them and we were satisfied. 

Food: Ok this is why the review gets 3 stars, as the food was just OK. We ordered the calamari (which came soggy and not light and crispy as it should). The charity bread was good for $2. The Margarita pizza was just ok as were the 2 pasta dishes we ordered...and they came out lukewarm.  We did tell our server and he warmed up our pasta, but still it was just ok...I make better pasta....this one tasted very bland.

Overall, there are better places in the complex you can go to like Canyon Creek. I was really expecting much  more from this place....and left a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was not. 

We ordered charity bread, mozzarella,  penne carbonara, meatball with spaghetti and the butcher pizza. 

The bread was beyond soggy, the mozzarella was... Different, I wouldn't suggest it. Penne carbonara was probably the best dish, thought it was only okay. While the meatball and pizza were very bland. Also, the pizza dough just tastes weird it shouldn't be hard to make a mediocre pizza at the very least. 

Considering this place replaced Alice fazoolies (poor food to begin with) this place doesn't seen to be much of a step up."}
{"text":"I've been to the scaddabush on Yonge and that location was much better. First I had made a reservation and when we got there they tried to seat us at some crappy table in the middle and we had to ask for a booth. The waitress got our order wrong and the food was pretty bad... soggy fries, smaller portions then the downtown location for the meatball sandwiches and the pasta tasted like a frozen dinner. So bad. I don't ever want to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Enjoyed most of the dishes we ordered. The bruschetta was harder than a Rock. Not enjoyable. The service was great seeing as our app had burnt and the manager came out to tell us and that it would be comped. Nice open patio for Summer. Pasta dishes are yum."}
{"text":"This place is a girls' night staple but I was rather disappointed to learn that they no longer serve the Spicy Arrabiata pasta. Their new substitute is pretty bland and over-tomatoey. The service during my last visit wasn't all that greater either, even though the place wasn't that packed. The calamari and dessert were excellent (as usual) though."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the service sucks and so does trying to make a reservation. I called to make a reservation on a Friday she asked what time and for how many, so when I told her she said they don't take reservations on a Friday lol so why did she asked me what time..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Very good Italian food.  Would be happy to go back :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! Lovely atmosphere, super friendly staff, and the food was amazing.
A little pricey but honestly worth it for how good it is. They even have a live DJ on certain days I hear. Very nice first experience and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing restaurant. I went here on a date with my boyfriend and we have a lovely time. 

I got one of their salads without cheese and it was absolutely delicious. We also got some bruchetta with avocado on it, and while we were eating the manager came around and offered samples on one of their pasta dishes (all their pasta is made fresh in-house daily), and it was great. 

When I saw their pizzas go to another table, they looked amazing.

My boyfriend got the bolognese and a tiramisu for dessert and loved both. Also great service and lovely atmosphere (although a bit loud - if you sit on the second floor its much better). We've both agreed this will be our new Italian date spot. 

It can get crowded though - I would make a reservation beforehand!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend last week after work. We arrived shortly after 6:00pm on Thursday and the place was virtually deserted, so I guess the after work crowd heads to Reds Midtown which is located next door and was much busier. We were greeted by three girls at the door and one of them showed us to our table.

The hostess was pleasant on the way to where we were to be seated. She asked the standard questions, \"how was your day? Is this your first time here? Lovely weather we're having, isn't it?\" etc. So that was fine. When we got to our booth she explained to us that we were seated by the window where we can watch the in-house cheese makers preparing the daily batch of mozzarella, which evidently they make every day at 6:00. Ok neat. Immediately after she left a second girl showed up with a tall glass bottle of water which she left on the table (which is nice, I like when restaurants do that), and she proceeded to explain the mozzarella window situation again. We didn't want to be rude and interrupt her so we listened to the spiel a second time. As soon as she walked away a third girl popped up table side. This time it was the server. She began the mozzarella story again but this time my friend politely let her know we have been informed. 

We gave the server our drink orders and she left. Since my dining companion and I haven't seen each other in a while we began catching up at this point and forgot all about the menu. A few minutes later when the waitress returned we let her know we needed a few minutes more to decide, so she said she would do \"one more lap around the restaurant\". Apparently she meant this literally and didn't consider the fact that it doesn't take long to do a lap around an almost empty restaurant because she reappeared barely a minute later and we again asked her for time to decide what we wanted to order.

When we did place our orders, the server asked us if we were interested in an appetizer. She, of course, insisted on one of their assorted mozzarella plates. I'm really not a fan of overly cheesy dishes so decided to decline, but at this point there was so much mozzarella chatter I almost felt compelled to order something that contained this sacred cheese, so we opted for the Fresh Mozzarella and Sun Dried Tomato Bruschetta. When it was delivered it was tasty enough. Crunchy toasted bread with fresh toppings; luckily the cheese had a nice mild flavour so a non-cheese guy like me could enjoy it without an overwhelming cheese taste.

For my main course I ordered The Butcher pizza. Again, the dish was perfectly adequate. It was extremely doughy. I'm generally more of a thin crust pizza kind of guy so it wasn't necessarily up my alley. I understand this is more of a personal taste thing so others may disagree, but it really wasn't the best pizza dough I've ever encountered. The toppings were bizarrely scattered on the pizza. One half of the pizza was loaded with bacon, sausage, pepperoni, and onions, while the other half was practically nothing but cheese and tomato sauce.

When we finished and the server returned she asked if we were interested in dessert. My friend attempted to say \"No thanks we'll take the bill, can you split it in two?\" but all she managed to get out of her mouth was \"No thanks we'll take the bill, can you spl...\" and with that the server pulled the bill (which she already printed and was apparently anxious to give us) out of her bill fold and plopped it down on the table. She spun around and walked away. Several minutes later I managed to wave her down from across the room and she returned and divided the bill for us as we wanted.

Overall a perfectly adequate, if underwhelming experience. The food, service, and ambiance were all suitable but nothing to write home about. I wouldn't place this on my list of high recommendations, but if you're ever in a position to check it out you shouldn't run away either. If I'm ever with a group who wants to head here I'll go back without arguing, but I likely won't suggest it otherwise."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for dinner with some friends. Good ambiance and service. However the food left much to be desired. I ordered a fresh mozzarella salad but had a taste of some of the other dishes, including pizza and pasta. Was it terrible? No. But was it memorable? Also no. Like some other reviewers said, LOTS OF OIL in these dishes. I'm not too familiar with Italian cooking but even I can make a better pasta than what I had. The mozzarella was actually not \"fresh\" as I could tell by its texture. It wasn't tender and moist as I had hoped it would be. 

Overall an acceptable place (especially for large groups as they have tons of seating). Not a good place for a date or if you're actually looking for delicious food."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! 
The meatball is something else! Yum! 
The charity bread while good, is drowning in butter. Would suggest you opt for the fresh mozzarella rather than the charity bread. 
Service, staff - absolutely impeccable!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow and I didn't like the communal table concept (big long table shared by many different customers) .  Food was meh."}
{"text":"Very good bruschetta.  Fresh mozerella made on site.  Prices are a bit high but very decent quality. It surpassed my expectations.  Guest were satisfied and service was great."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Thanks for making our evening fantastic. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow. I didn't realize it has been almost two years since I last dined at Scaddabush.

I had dinner here with my boyfriend this (Thursday) evening and we were pleasantly surprised... Amazing service, great food and drinks, relaxed ambience, and $7 Bellinis every Thursday. ;)

Our server, Nick, was very friendly and outgoing. His recommendations were on point! 

Our go-to is a (peach) mango Bellini, but I wanted to try the Blood Orange Bellini so we ordered both. The Peach Mango Bellini was way better.

We started with the Bomba Burrata and it was so good. Fresh mozzarella in a spicy tomato sauce with bacon over a slice of fresh focaccia bread made in-house -- mmm... It was spicy, but not too spicy. 

Next up was the Italian Burger, which is, apparently, Nick's favourite item on the entire menu. We had to give it a try... The focaccia bun was fresh, the beef was nicely cooked to a medium, the fried mozzarella was crispy, and the pesto aioli really stood out. We also tried the Rosemary Garlic Fries as our side dish and it was great.

My boyfriend was eyeing the Smoked Bacon and Egg Pizza, but instead, opted to try a pasta we've never tried before. We decided on the Pesto Pollo. The pasta was not cooked al dente nor over-cooked. The basil pesto cream sauce was tasty and the semi sun-dried tomatoes complemented the chicken and the spinach well. It was a very simple but comforting dish. 

After a great experience at Scaddabush this evening, I have already recommended the Italian Burger to my burger-loving friends. :) Thanks, Nick!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Italian restaurants! 
Love the crispy polenta tots as a starter, definitely have to try if you're planning on eating there.
Never disappointed with the food I order, the only thing disappointing is the service."}
{"text":"I love the Scaddabush in Richmond Hill. Unfortunately they cant get the mozzarella right in Scarborough! The consistency wasn't chewy enough and it was way too soggy. The peppers used in Richmond Hill was spicy whereas you could barely taste it here. Please fix this before we come back next time!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere 5/5, food 5/5, service 5/5
I'm quite impressed as this is in a tourist area, the food is not spectacular, but deserves 5 star for hand making most food items, which means they used only a few ingredients! The presentation of food is what gets the best points, you could take many Instagram worthy photos. We had the 25% off card got a good discount, had there not been the discount it would have still been a 5 stars. Recommend sitting at high table and not booths unless you have family or kids."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is amazing! Go for the charity bread as a starter........then get the spaghetti with the loaded meatball (portions a pretty filling). I got them to spice it up a little bit which was amazing too! Finish it off with the cheesecake!  Share it though cause its a huge piece! The service was OK. It took 10 minutes to get my drink but the manager came right over and gave it to us on the house! They have live DJs and has a great atmosphere. Would go again and you should try it out!"}
{"text":"E-mailed in to make a lunch reservation for my birthday for 11 guests. Got confirmation from the service manager. When I got there, the hostess told me she didn't have any reservation under my name. Showed her my confirmation e-mail and luckily there was enough space to seat us. Waitress was not very nice or accommodating. At one point they said their systems went down so they lost all our orders that's why they didn't know whose food was whose. My friend ordered a gluten free meal and when the server placed her order in front of her I made sure to ask if it was gluten free and she reassured us it was. We later found out it wasn't. Luckily my friend hadn't started eating her food when someone came back a few minutes later. Could have turned out pretty bad. Not really impressed with this location at all. Gave us complimentary dessert but wasn't enough for the poor execution."}
{"text":"Great place. Came here for lunch today for a holiday gathering. Food was good (you have to try the butternut ravioli - to die for). Service was good, no hiccups. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is because it wasn't over-the-top fabulous. Solid 4 stars (and that's a good thing)."}
{"text":"Decent service, good food and nice patio. The charity bread is good but wouldn't go back - typical chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Service took long. 

Cool atmosphere.. Theres a dj there.. I was told that on Friday nights, they play hiphop but it was not true (maybe a diff location).

Spaghetti n meatball was alright.. Don't get the mozz inside it because cheese aren't even melted.

The charity bread was good.. It was pretty pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Really great spaghetti and meatball. You get one huge meatball. The mozzarella is house made and a great start to the meal. The service was fantastic and the people are really friendly. It's a must for Italian trendy fun good and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. However, not the same can be said about the service. My girlfriend and I sat in the bar area and were served our drinks fairly quickly and that's the only good thing I can say about the service. It took approximately 25 minutes for one of the 6 servers that were just hanging around the bar, chatting and counting their tips to notice that my girlfriend and I were ready to order."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want fresh tasting Italian food that will leave you feeling full! I came here for lunch and the restaurant's interior was nice and welcoming. I would describe the ambience as cosy, perfect for date or a family meal. 

Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by the hostess who then seated us. When our server came, he was really attentive. He checked up on us frequently, refilled our drinks, and was also humorous which made us feel comfortable. He was a great server!

For food, we ordered the straight up meatball, penne bolognese and the butcher. Everything that we ordered was really delicious and fresh tasting. Their sangrias are really good as well! 

Overall, Scaddabush serves tasty Italian food. Although I am usually skeptical of Italian chain restaurants, my experience here was enjoyable. I would definitely come back next time!"}
{"text":"I ordered Sophia pizza and I was expecting a delicious food with proper spice. What I ended up eating was testing horrible , super spicy which burned my mouth. I couldn't even have the second slice. The funny thing is we checked the menu to see if there was any indication of the spiciness of the food! No! Nothing . I'm assuming they just dropped the bottle of pepper in the pizza hoping no one will notice."}
{"text":"Just returned from scaddabush and don't usually write a review for anything but felt compelled to do so today! I am from a city that is predominantly Italian and have eaten many different pizzas but the \"butcher\" pizza I had tonight was the best I have ever tasted.....I loved the thin crust and it was very flavourful.  The naked mozzarella was absolutely delicious and we watched as they made it....very interesting!  I also need to comment on our waitress, Amada C.  She was exceptionally friendly and very accommodating.  I would give her 5 stars as well. We will definitely come back on our next visit to TO."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant on several occasions. The service has been satisfactory and the food delicious. I look for opportunities to go back to enjoy the wonderful, mozzarella, mainz and sangria."}
{"text":"The service is tremendously good here. The hosts, waiters/waitresses, chefs and managers are all very friendly. I came here a few weeks ago with some friends for a girlfriends birthday. The whole team was kind, funny and on point. 

My friend and I were sharing a large pasta dish but she had to leave earlier than expected. The waitress overheard and went to tell the chef to make it a small. I thought that was very gracious seeing I did not want to mention it, as to not be an inconvenience to the kitchen staff. She came back with the large and said the chef said not to worry about it! And they charged me for a small still. 

When distributing my friends cake, the staff were extremely friendly. All smiles and professional. It was wonderful to have such great service.

I ordered some of their homemade fresh mozzarella. I got the \"naked\" one which was still great but my friends got the buratta (infused with honey and truffle cream). If you're gonna get one - get that one instead. 

I also ordered the pesto pollo (fettuccine, sautéed chicken, baby spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and basil pesto cream sauce). It was very tasty. Worth mentioning was my drink: normally I don't drink sangria's but their white sangria is exceptional. It has a mix of Pinot Grigio, limoncello, passionate fruit, apple, gingerale and lemon juice. It's like summer hosted in a cup! 

Although the service and food is great, my only critique is the pricing is quite high. As most franchises, the prices are a bit unreasonable."}
{"text":"Not too impressed.  The menu is described to make it seem like they have the most authentic Italian food.  
It's basically Italian fast food. The fresh mozzarella ball was the best dish we had. The meatball was a bit salty, osso bucco tasted like an Asian dish, fried artichokes and cauliflower were good but only had 3 pieces of artichoke and the rest was cauliflower.  Pizza was bland and dry and the carbonara was not at all great. 
Panna Cotta was creamy, tasted like pudding.  Also, they ran out of polenta bites and zeppole but i'm assuming I didn't miss out on much.
On the plus side the service was good but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone nor would I return."}
{"text":"Very central down Toronto busiest street and close to the Marriott Courtyard hotel. Our party of four was hungry and did not get disappointed. We shared a tasty and original charity bread before taking pasta carbonara and Italian burger. The service was quick though the place was packed on a Friday evening before the extended Labour Day weekend and our server was nevertheless polite and helpful. The only negative point was the high noise level of the patrons conversation complemented by the loud background music. The quality of the food is surprisingly good for such a big place."}
{"text":"After a not so great first impression of Scaddabush, the general manager invited me back and I can say that it was a much, much better experience. 

Our server Alex was amazing, he had such a great sense of humour and it was a joy to interact with him throughout the night. 

Thank you to Catalina and Alex for making it a great Scaddabush experience."}
{"text":"Based on where my wife and I grew up and our families we tend to be Italian food snobs. It's not the hole in the wall little old Italian grandma place, but for a decent sized place they did exceptional. The fresh mozzarella is amazing and the entrees were stellar. We took the family for lunch on a fluke as we were just driving thru the area and wanted something to eat. We were not disappointed. The kids loved their pizzas and pasta. I had the baked Carbonara and my wife got the fresh made Caesar salad with a sandwich (can't remember which one). It was all delicious. I love how so much is made on site!! The kids got free gelato with their meals so we shared the apple ravioli. The gelato was tasty as were the ravs.

The atmosphere is right up our alley. It is very industrial/rustic/mismatch chic. :)

Our server was awesome and everyone was very friendly and helpful! I wish I could remember her name. She was there helping out from another location, since they were only open for about 2wks at this location. She knew the menu and could make recommendations very well!

My wife has some food allergies. They were very accommodating where they could and impressed us with how far they would go."}
{"text":"Food was cheap. It was literally drenched in oil. I feel like I could have gone to Pizza Hut and gotten similar quality for a cheaper price. 

Waiters were rude and unfriendly. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went with by husband for his bday dinner because we had previously eaten here before and were satisfied previously.

This last experience had made us decide not to return. The pasta I always order was completely different.. the chef used different noodles and it turned out terrible.

We ordered the garlic break for appetizer and it was brought to us completely cold , we then had to wait another 10min for a replacement. 

My husband was also very disappointed with his burger, it resembled more of a small sandwich."}
{"text":"I planned a birthday party for my daughter and her friends. I picked a set dinner menu and requested to have some changes made. They did it without hesitation. They called the day before to confirm the reservation and the day of to confirm meal changes. It was perfect. Stayed on budget.
The place is very busy so reservation is a must.  The food was great. Definitely a good place. Atmosphere is fun and nice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by over the weekend with my Husband it was fabulous! I had the butternut squash and he had the spaghetti and meatballs YUM.

great service and atmosphere - never disappoints! love this restaurant.."}
{"text":"The location of this place (it being so close to square one) made it a go to spot for alot of our hangouts. For real though, this used to go to this place allll the time, especially for their charity bread. But unfortunately,  its not as good as it used to be. Their pasta is still decent (both in taste and in terms of portions). The Penne Arrabbiata is nice, they could add a bit more sauce as it can be a little dry imo. I still loveee their rosemary garlic fries, just as crispy, fresh and delicious as I remember them. The service is ok, can be slow depending on the time you go.

Overall, would recommend if youre in the area. But wouldnt go out of the way to come here."}
{"text":"Enjoyable meal in a well planned restaurant.

Our server told us it first opened in Feb 2014. It reminded us of a some of the large Italian chain restaurants in the USA.

Although the address is 382 Yonge Street, Unit #7.  It is actually on the north side of Gerrard and you enter about 75 meters west of Yonge.  You won't see it on Google Maps street view as it is part of the new Aura Condo building (tallest residential condo building in Canada). 

The owners are www.sircorp.com which also own the two restaurants on either side of Scaddabush - Reds wine bar and Dukes.

Scaddabush is a large restaurant and looks like large groups are a primary target.

The pasta is made fresh daily on site (except for a few items like whole wheat). I am not a big fan of this type of pasta but it is nice once in a while.  They offer a handmade mozzarella cheese appetizer which you can watch them make - we made it back to the kitchen just as they were finishing ours so we did not see the whole process - it did taste excellent and will order it again.

The wait staff are very good - although they seemed over qualified for their positions (i.e. lots of education).

We really liked that sircorp is not greedy and has wines starting at a reasonable $1 per ounce.

Overall if you have a party of two or a large group, you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is really good. Service is great. Everything had great flavour. Underrated restaurant. Recommended for a date night or just a night out with the family."}
{"text":"Came here at 3 pm so after lunch rush but before dinner rush, with my husband and son. 
The waiter came & asked if we wanted to order our drinks. My son did not have a chance to see what was available from the kid's menu so he opened it & the waiter said he would just come back later. He made us feel that we were wasting his time. 
He came back & we ordered calamari for starter, chicken fingers from kid's menu, prosciutto cotto grilled cheese with Caesar salad & tomato fennel soup. He came back a few minutes later to let us know that they were out of calamari so we ordered zucchini fritti. 
The zucchini was mostly batter & greasy. 2 pieces looked like they were burnt. The sauce that came with it was good. 
The chicken fingers were burnt & hard. Fries were undercooked & no salt on them. No salt shakers on the table to put on them.
The Caesar salad was tasteless. It definitely needed lemon or something. 
The soup was ok nothing to come back for. 
Sandwich was ok but again nothing to come back for. 
While we were waiting for the donut dessert that came with the kids meal I noticed the table next to us was served calamari. I thought maybe it was something that looked like calamari but I heard their waitress ask how their calamari was. So weird that it was available for them & not for us. I also noticed another table enjoying calamari on my way out of restaurant. 
Waiter did not remove any of our plates when we ordered the donuts. So when he came with it there was no place to put it down. I actually moved some of the plates so he can place it down. & as he left still did not remove any dishes from our table. 
Bad service & food is not good. I am definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"A selection of decent wines, good food and attentive wait staff provided us an enjoyable evening. The kids loved the Italian wedding soup. The chicken limone was excellent. The half pound meatball was filling and tasty, though I typically prefer mine with a little more texture.  Caprese salad is one of my favorites and they do it well here, with their own fresh mozzarella. However, was a little disappointed to find arugula in the caprese - not my thing."}
{"text":"place is nice , ie look and feel of restaurant is good 
thats about it
food is ok , not authentic, steak was burnt and bloody , pizza is okay at best 
salad was drenched in dressing
service not good, typical high school / university kids are running the place and not well; forgetful , fooling around etc"}
{"text":"atmoshphere and look is very good , food ok , run by kids, steak burnt and bloody , salad soaked in dressing , pizza ok , not very authentic ...service ok , trying but forgetful"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, excellent service. Amazing food. The male bartender with the longer hair in a pony tail ( didnt get his name) was super attentive did an amazing job serving us considering it was so busy. We will for sure be back, i have also already recommended this place to family. You have to try the pizza delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I love the option to share with friends and enjoy a number of dishes instead of being limited to one entree. 
The zucca is outstanding and the daily house made mozzarella and NOT be beat.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Place was half empty. We got seated and after 20 mins of waiting not one waitress approached us. If you want to go hungry, go to this place. I can't even imagine how the service will be when they're actually busy!!! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I've tried their regular menu as well as their winterlicious menu. 

Overall,  the food is meh. The food is alright but it's nothing memorable.  I don't really plan on coming back here.  Not because there was anything wrong with the place,  the menu is just boring. 

 It's a big place and the beer selection is fairly decent.  It's a little pricey and the value isn't there. 

If you're looking for some Italian,  there a better places out there."}
{"text":"The pastas were poorly made 
We ordered the carbonara and it was extremely bland. It tasted like nothing. The pasta itself was also over cooked to a point where it would pass as soggy. 

We also ordered ravioli. One of the pieces was not fully cooked properly. It was hard on the inside 

The service on the other hand was great. Our server was understanding and she was able to leave us satisfied."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night with a few adults and some children.

The first dish was a fresh mozzarella, jam, prosciutto, and bread appetizer. I didn't see the purpose of the jam, however it was tasty and a good starter.

The main was extremely large meatballs and some pasta with basic tomato sauce on it. The only complaints I have about this dish: 1. the pasta wasn't salty enough 2. the sauce wasn't tasty/salted enough 3. the meatballs were just okay, not great.

For the prices they charge, I expected more, and I didn't get more.

Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I came here with friends after work and was delighted to find a vegetarian friendly item in the menu. I had the cavatappi-sorrentina pasta that was delicious and later ordered tiramisu for dessert that I shared with a friend. Overall I had a good experience from the food to the friendly waiter and more importantly there wasn't much wait time."}
{"text":"I love Scaddabush! I love the great atmosphere when you walk in - the scattered candles on tables look great. Service was on point - host at the door was very friend and our server, Elisha, was super personable. She chatted about the food really well. I had their fresh mozzarella to share w my friends which I am so glad we did - soo good!! Followed by the zucca pasta and finished by ordering their cheesecake for the table. The food was incredible, very filling even though we shared most of our food. I cannot wait to be back! They have a few different mozzarellas that I really want to try!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in the past year.  The first time their seafood pasta had no flavour, and we had to send it back.  This time I ordered a caesar salad with shrimp and the shrimp had no flavour.  The salad was not restaurant quality.  We also ordered a charity bread, which was delicious, but was barely warm when it arrived.  We sent it back and requested a hot one, which arrived more than 10 mins later and it was warm.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I would choose food from the foodcourt over this place."}
{"text":"signature stuffed meatball was not good, bland and too small. indicates to me the rest of the food isn't good either"}
{"text":"Went here after work last night with my boyfriend. I had a small Caesar, and small zucca (squash ravioli) pasta. He had the rosemary fries and we shared the charity bread (can you tell I worked all night and was starving? Lol)
Caesar was garlicy and fresh, pasta hot and the ravioli were smooth in the center. I love the idea of the charity bread and the fries were unique and yummy. 
Service was fantastic especially considering it was about midnight. We sat in the lounge and the only thing I would say was a negative was how loud the dj had the music on. We were quite far away from her but we had to yell a bit in order to hear each other talk. Needless To say I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Loud and noisy atmosphere, average service, bland and disappoint dishes. My family and I attend on a Saturday evening. We sat on a booth and ordered a appetizer and drinks. We ordered the garlic bread which looked great but filled with oils and grease. The oil was sitting on the bottom of the skillet. It left my throat feeling tight and icky. We then order our mains. The menu was very confusing and hard to pick a choice. Everyone assumed that pasta is served with the main since the restaurant was entirely based Italian cuisine. Myself, and two other family members ordered the exact same dish because it seemed like the best option on the menu. It was the grilled sirloin ( sirloin brushed with herbs, rosemary garlic fries and baby arugula, tomato salad) The sirloin was under seasoned and bland. The salad lacked tomatoes, and tasted like rabbit food. And the fries missed the garlic component completely and was the best part of the entire dish. It was not worth the price based on the tasted. My mother ordered the grilled chicken limone. The chicken was bland, and lacked seasoning. The sauce was great. We asked the waitress or salt and pepper but she did not bring it. We decided not to order pasta based on the food. And did not order dessert because it was overprice. Overall, I would not be returning to a scaddabush location!"}
{"text":"Yummmm!!!! That big frickin meatball is sooo good!!!! Really nice atmosphere, good spot for a dinner date.  Quiet, intimate ambiance and great Italian menu.  Must try."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Came here for summerlicious yesterday. The avocado and goat cheese bruschetta was ok. But the pasta sauce was extremely oily and the pasta was overcooked, we told the waiter and he sent it back to the kitchen after he said \"it's made in-house, fresh everyday.\" We did not say it was not fresh, we said it was overcooked. And he went on to inform us that he did not cook it, yeah, no kidding -.- We got another pasta. However, she didn't really want another because the flavour was lacklustre as it was, but the second was a lot less oily. The chicken parm sandwich was ok. The chocolate cake was also mediocre. Overall, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food was nothing special. There is lots of parking and the atmosphere is nice. I would go next store to jacks its way better food"}
{"text":"I came here after hearing countless good reviews but left slightly disappointed. 

I ordered the Capri which is fettuccine topped with mussels, shrimps, scallops and squid. It included a fair amount of seafood which was a definite plus, however, it was slightly under seasoned. 

My boyfriend ordered the lobster spaghetti which I found a lot more enjoyable. The pasta was well seasoned and had a nice crunchy texture. Although, it was lacking in lobster.

The best part of the night was definitely the fresh mozzarella which is made to order and only available after 5 pm. We ordered the Buratta ($12.98) which is infused with honey and truffle cream and served with focaccia crostini. It was pretty oily but I loved it nonetheless. Would definitely return just to try the other types of mozzarella."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now. Loved just about everything we have ordered, including the meatball (on it's own or with spaghetti), bruschetta, pesto pollo, and pizza. Bolognese was a little dry, very little meat sauce on the pasta. Charity bread was lovely but very garlicky, and I love garlic! The one thing that crops up again and again is the service. Slow, can be hard to get your server, and they often don't listen but they have turned on their heel and are gone before you get a chance to correct them. This has been really annoying."}
{"text":"I love this place. Usually if you want Italian food in Mississauga it's accompanied by white table cloths and snooty waiters. Or you can get takeout from those same places. But as far as eating AT the actual restaurant, this place solved both of those issues. It's a super casual italian place, where the food is good, service is friendly, and you can have a good time with some friends on a Friday night on the patio."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Started coming here because I live close and to wind down after work. Staff here is AMAZING. Everyone is so friendly. My regular bartenders remembers my name, drink, what food I like, and my fave, Paula, has made food recommendations to me that I've absolutely loved. Only problem is now its hard to decide what to get because everything is amazing. Pesto pollo, bruschetta, Classico meatball, Caesar salad, shrimp spaghetti (Paula's recommendation and now I can't pick between that or pesto pollo), salmon entree, and the TIRAMISU IS TO DIE FOR. I def MAKE room for that. Met the chefs that makes the tiramisu from scratch and they are so sweet and down to earth. Atmosphere is great for a wind down; dimly lit and good music that's not too loud. It's not packed and loud an obnoxious like some bars are. 
Thank you Paula, Matty, Brennan, Eric, Cal, Eric, Leath, Alberto, Heema, Thang and the chefs that make my delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, and definitely worth going back. I loved their cheesecake, it was awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty good the first time around. I need a second try to confirm its reputation. 
Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to have pasta and been there at least 5 times. However, I don't think I'll be coming here again because of the following:

One of my visits, my sister-in-law ordered pasta and it was underdone. It was not al dente and it's disappointing because tasting the pasta before taking it out of the water should be something a chef do instinctively. One of my visit was during Winterlicious (completely forgot about it) and the food all across the table was average. I do understand Winterlicious it's a busy time for restaurants but a 5 star will put out the same quality.

The only dish I liked was Napoli (a pasta dish they took out of the menu...it was well put together), and Baked Carbonara. 
The Capri was mediocre in my opinion. Tomato sauce was as boring/bland as it can get from a can. It was simply a toss of canned pasta sauce, pasta, and seafood with lack of seasoning.

Service: Average. Of all the times I've been there, nothing stood out. Service it's as okay as it gets.

I need to find a new/better place now."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, have been here every few months since it opened. Last time I was here for a party I was organizing, about 14 people. The staff was good and did a great job pulling it off. For a party that big we didn't have to wait long and the food was fresh and tasty.

Only complaint I have is price. Owners should think about this. The place is wayyyyyy too overpriced for the food you get. It's good food, but for this price you might as well drive the 20 minutes to go to Toronto."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, and won't be the last. The atmosphere is cozy and the place it self it very large. All the staff were very professional and our waitress was great, she helped us out with the menus let us know what are the most popular dishes, etc. She even pointed out the features for tonight and was so patient with us when we kept chit chatting instead of looking at the menu to order. All of your dishes came out piping out and were delicious, my friends ordered the red snapper and chicken parm, and I had the spicy mozzarella- huge portion and absolutely delicious! We will def be back at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great food. Really nice and engaging service. Love their Barrel aged Negroni."}
{"text":"This place is good, so good in fact ive been back 4 times this summer. It can be quite loud, but its a good friendly atmosphere and the food is always a good fit even for picky eaters. Love the fresh mozarella it is definitley worth coming in just to try! The servers are friendly, the service is reasonably fast. Really appreciate that they have different protion sizes for their pastas, meaning you can have a little or a lot and stil lfeel great. A place I will keep coming back to!"}
{"text":"Excellent food but the service and atmosphere could be much better though. Music is way too loud. It's not a club. Can't even talk across the table."}
{"text":"I went to this location over the weekend to meet up with my friend and we were excited to try something new.  Upon entering the restaurant we loved the ambience and you could tell it was a new place.  However, it went downhill from when we got our food and drinks! I ordered the stuffed meatball with spaghetti .. My pasta was overcooked.. the meatball tasted mediocre.. nothing special and then I found out I was food poisoned from it!! My friend ordered the parmadora pizza and she also said her pizza was nothing special.  We ordered the peach bellini as recommended by the host and it was more slush and felt like a waterdowned alcoholic beverage.  Not impressed with this place. When we were walking out we received a coupon for 10$ off a 30 dollar purchase.  All I know is we wont be using it because we wont be returning to this place.  So disappointed for such a hyped up restaurant.  I expected much more from an \"Italian\" kitchen and bar!!!"}
{"text":"I understand that they are a new establishment, but no one seemed to know what they were doing. Parts of our order were duplicated, where 2 different servers brought us the same item.  At the same time, parts of our order never came out.
The mozzarella was amazing, otherwise, the food was just OK.
I would probably try this restaurant again in a few months, and hopefully by then, they'll have their processes together and have properly trained their staff."}
{"text":"Had the Zucca ravioli - very nice.  Perhaps a little too much cream sauce.  I did not matter, I finished the entire meal.  For dessert we had the tiramisu... It's a little different from the traditional.  The coffee soaked lady fingers were virtually nonexistent.  Next time I would opt for something different.  We went on a busy night which is great if you have a big group.  I would recommend a visit if you are in the Mississauga/Square One area."}
{"text":"Been looking for an Italian restaurant for quite some time downtown. Finally found it - the pizzas/pastas here are so creative and authentic that you can't find elsewhere. Been to the location in Square one Mississauga too and it was good. The environment and decor is also quite cool too!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight w/ co-worker. Ordered dinner, side salad and a glass of wine. Waitress comes back and apologizes- apparently she delayed putting in the order so the meal would be properly spaced but in doing so they sold out of my dinner option. Uhm, it's 6:30 on a Wednesday night with a full restaurant, how do you sell out of a regular pasta option at an Italian restaurant? Fine. I choose something else.

Pasta arrived & after a bite or two it was clear that half the pasta wasn't cooked. Sent it back. Floor manager comes to the table, introduces himself, apologizes & says we will have a new plate out ASAP personally delivered by him. 25 minutes later I caught our waitress and asked to have it \"to go\" as my dinner companion had dragged out eating her meal as long as possible & is now finished. Alex, the manager comes by and says \"I was just on my way to deliver your meal when the waitress said you wanted it to go\" and apologizes again.  Considering I could see him delivering food and chatting with other patrons, he wasn't anywhere near my food, but okay & we ask for the bills. I opened the container to ensure it was my meal and took a bite - the pasta is so over cooked it is mush and its lukewarm, like it had been sitting for an extended period of time waiting to be served. 

Alex shows up at the table again with 2 glasses of prosecco without confirming we would like a glass (which neither of us do) ... he then comps the $5 wine special for both myself and my dinner companion & offers a free dessert for NEXT time I come in ... pretty sure there won't be a next time.  He said my meal was on the house as it wasn't right ... except the bill shows up and there is my lonely salad listed and requiring payment. Really?! 

As we are leaving (ie coats on and about to walk away from the table) a 3rd waitress shows up with a bowl of pasta and looks at me like I'm crazy when I say i already have my meal but would gladly exchange my take away container if the pasta she was holding was cooked and hot. 

Complete disorganization and will more than likely not be back. Mushy pasta went straight to the bin on the way home. Thank goodness my dinner companion was entertained ..."}
{"text":"It's centrally located, but if your looking for a meal to fill you up, it's not the place.
I had ask the Hostess if the portion were big, answer was yes.
When server came, I ask again and took the pasta for 4 ,called social....we ended up eating out
The server was great though."}
{"text":"We came to Scaddabush with a party of 8 last night and had an amazing meal. We ate family style, sharing an array of delicious dishes. We started with bruschetta and the charity bread which was amazing (with an amazing concept). The handmade mozzarella cheeses were incredible.  I think the regular mozza ball was the table favourite. The pizzas and pastas were great and the spinach dip was amazing.

 Our server Taylor was perfect. She was super attentive and helped make our experience all the more enjoyable. She explained all the food details to us and was even cute enough to point out the master in the kitchen who hand made the mozzarella ball we were happily scarfing down. The atmosphere was perfect, we loved the decor and the rest of the staff was on point also. Thank you so much guys, we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We were there for a surprise birthday party. Apparently, there was a mix-up, and our party, that had reserved the upper floor, got bumped downstairs. Mistakes made... a bit of a letdown, but not a huge deal. The servers were very friendly and personable, though seemed disorganized. Taking orders for our group of 25 was confusing. I wanted to order a drink, but never got a chance, and we had to remind them about our kids' drink order (chocolate milk). Food was nothing spectacular. Decent fare, small portions. By the time I got my pasta, and I was one of the last people to get their food, it was warm, at best.

I appreciate the effort the staff made in accommodating our large group. I could tell they were working hard, and I'm sure it wasn't easy. That being said, I don't think I'll personally be going back again..."}
{"text":"I made reservations about 2 weeks in advance here for Valentine's Day. I took the girlfriend because were both pasta aficionados and Scaddabush is one of the few places that actually make pasta in-house.

We were initially seated at a square table (for 2) but we asked to see if we could move to a booth. Honestly, I wasn't expecting any accommodations since Scaddabush was packed on reservations, but our waiter Ivan checked despite this. I really applaud him on this, he went over and above what I was expecting. Nevertheless, we got our booth (and a note-to-self to make sure we reserve a booth for the next outing). 

Our waiter Ivan was very personable, had excellent table side manners, and really made, what was obviously a very busy night, go perfectly!



We ordered a pizza to start with - the Sophia. Typically we go for the Diavolo, but the Sophia was a nice change. Personally, I thought the Diavolo was better and had more flavour, but the Sophia's goat cheese and caramelized onions were a nice change, though subtle in comparison. We prefer using the pizzas as an appetizer because it's more of a social food once cut up than the others, and a bit more filling for the dollar too. 

For a main, I ordered the Pesto Pollo. Now let me preface this part of the review by saying Pesto Pollo is my go-to dish, it's a grand slam of a pasta plate everytime I've had it, and tonight was no different. It has just the right amount of pesto, real basil leaves, grilled chicken that's actually grilled perfectly to hold it's own in a pasta dish (not quite soft, more on the crunchy grilled side), and a nice dash of sun dried tomatoes and cheese. The pasta is a tagliatelle/fettuccine, which was cooked absolutely perfectly. It's been a while since I've had non-boxed pasta, but oh boy was it worth it! Definitely a 5/5 in my books!

The lady-friend had the Capri. This was a tomato-based seafood mix pasta. She had ordered a small, but surprisingly her plate was almost as big as my \"regular\" pesto pollo. The kitchen might have up sized the plate by mistake, but hey, no one's complaining. When I tasted the Capri, it was alright -- it's mediocre at best, I still think the pesto pollo is the star of this restaurant. 

For dessert, we had the valentines day cheesecake on recommendation by Ivan the waiter, and boy was it good! It was very rich, it came with a berry compote and a fresh whipped dollop of cream, but this cake was actually very rich in flavour and absolutely delicious! This one wasn't a menu item, it was a valentines day special. Doesn't come across as a frozen store bought one, it was creamy and smooth throughout. 

All in all, this was an awesome dining experience! The food was on-point, the Service was outstanding despite the stress of Valentines day, and I don't think I've had a personable and as-involved waiter as Ivan! I'll be making my request for him the next time I come in!"}
{"text":"Servers give you the minimum service. Ironic since they're called servers. Pasta served without pepper or cheese. Missing a couple ingredients that were on the menu. Their wifi codes have a note telling you not to ask any servers if you need help configuring it."}
{"text":"Lovely place with beautiful decoration. The food was very good. I ordered naked mozzarella for appetizer. It was different but good. For main dish I ordered Zucca, butternut squash ravioli, and it was super delicious! I really loved it!"}
{"text":"Food was meh. I ordered the spaghetti with stuffed meatball. The pasta was a bit soggy. The sauce was just ok, I've had better. The meatball was stuffed with pepperoni, was expecting it to be cheese since it doesn't indicate what the stuffing is on the menu. My friend ordered the meatball sandwich. It came with a side of fries but she waited for a while for the fries. Our host did come to let her know that her fries was coming, and that the reason it was taking a while was because they wanted to make her a fresh batch (why she said that I don't know, I mean shouldn't they be serving fresh batches anyway, considering the price of the meal??)--mind you at this point we had already been waiting for close to half an hour. Well, my friend ate and finished her sandwich and still no fries. In the end she just asked the host to wrap it up to go for her. The place itself is nice, but the music was way too loud. I found myself yelling to carry a conversation with my friends across the table (it was a round table for 6). One good thing about this place was the friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for a co-worker's birthday during lunch. My first impression of the place is upscale and cozy. I thought the service was great from the friendly staff. 

I ordered the half pound stuffed meatball ($12.95) from the sociables which comes with a crostini, garlic chips and inside the meatball is cheese and sausage (I believe). Meatball was very salty and the crostini must have been doused in some kind of salty concoction. It's one of those things when you take the first bite and its really good but after a couple of bites in then becomes unbearable. That's how I felt about the meatball but this may be due to the fact I ate this alone with no pasta or plain bread. However, I thought the crostini would have given the meatball some balance but it only added to the sodium overload. 

Would I go there again? To be honest, no. Nothing on the menu really appealed to me but I do think it would be great for social gatherings."}
{"text":"A great popular restarant and bar. Cool communal tables are an option. Nice outdoor patio garden escape. The meatball and the other apps are amazing. Big bar area. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"I came back last Friday night to find quicker service and better food. I ordered the bakes carbonara which was flavourful albeit a little salty. My husband ordered the meatballs and spaghetti which was good as well. Our friends ordered the prosciutto appetizer which was excellent from what we have tried. My only complaint is that although service was quicker than last time, our server still seemed unsure of herself when we were ordering. Also, she tried taking away my tea when I was not finished with it yet. Despite this, we would definitely consider coming back again."}
{"text":"Went to Scaddabush today for winterlicious lunch, which cost $18 before taxes. I was very disappointed .

I had the avocado bruschetta, chicken arugula salad and chocolate ganosh cake. The salad, which was the entree, was horrible. I expected a grilled or baked chicken, given all the greens: but instead I got a small piece of breaded fried chicken. Gross. The greens were dry with very little dressing and flavorless. Basically, rabbit food. 

The bruschetta and the cake were good.

I actually like Scaddabush and have been there a few times for lunch and dinner but the winterlicious menu is really weak. 

I would go back but I would not order from the winterlicious menu again.  

The atmosphere and staff are great."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. While the atmosphere and decor are awesome, the menu is hit or miss.

Hits: the meatball dish you must try, as well as the charity bread. service is also fast and friendly. Great place to host a medium-large dinner party.

Misses: the menu is a bit of a let down overall. it has potential to be more, but it feels like just like a jack astor's with flare. with the speed at which things come out of the kitchen, i suspect not many things are fresh. for example, the pizza tastes like the frozen kind you'd make at home, and the chicken parm was definitely pre-made with how quickly it came out"}
{"text":"I don't know why people rate it highly. I went to this after the good rating from yelpers but found it so,so. I ordered the meatball sandwich after the server raved about their daily made mozzarella cheese and the meatballs.
However, the meatballs were quite bland. I asked for some marinara sauce to give it some flavor. You would think that an Italian restaurant would have some readily available but no. Took about 10 minutes to get some."}
{"text":"I love the food but I asked to make a reservation on the phone and they said they weren't taking anymore reservations, however, open table allowed me to reserve. Anyways, when I asked literally 15 min before getting to the restaurant, the lady picked up the phone said there was no wait. So I'm here going to wait for 35 min. I realize it might be a business strategy but I don't understand why I couldn't make a table reservation. And by the way, the lady up front was rude and unapologetic. I am a customer btw."}
{"text":"I have been to scaddabush on at least 6 occasions in large groups and small groups. Whether you are there with one person or several, their service is slow. Very slow. 

They take forever to get your drink order, and throughout the meal they don't ask if you would like another beverage. If you are drinking a soda, they automatically bring it over, but never ask if anyone would like a second glass of wine. The waiters wait at least 20 minutes in between checking on the table. By the time they collect the dishes and ask if you want dessert, you are so impatient that I say no to dessert nearly every time. 

On one occasion I ordered the panna cotta for dessert and when it arrived it tasted like it was sour and fermented. I didn't see our server for literally half an hour to tell her it tasted bad, and I was so tired of waiting that I didn't order anything else in place of it. 

Don't get me wrong, their dishes are great and I have liked every dish and appetizer I've gotten there (and having eaten there 6 times, I've tried a lot of the menu).

I get it, restaurants get busy, and I understand a delay, but there is a serious problem with this place since the slow service has happened to me every time. 
Its really turning me off of this place. Such a shame because its a nice atmosphere and has a great menu."}
{"text":"Just ate here last night. This place used to be Alice Fazoolis which wasn't all that impressive and I had concerns about it being the same. Well I was delightfully surprised! The Atmosphere was very modern with a classic touch the staff was nice and most importantly the food was delicious. I would recommend the butcher pizza to any meat lover and their chicken parm was delicious as well! Also the first restaurant that gives you cool shears to cut your pizza with!"}
{"text":"I was heading to Jack Astor's with my family and Scaddabush was next door so we decided to give it a try. The atmosphere drove us in without even checking the menu first. The place is huge. We noticed there was a kitchen staff meeting by the bar where they we're being shown a plate. Right away you can notice how they care about presentation and quality control of the dishes. Once we sat down it was hard to not notice their huge wine cellar. Unfortunate there are no rosé wines available (for my wife). The server, Claudia, was amazing. We had one of the best Italian meals we've ever had. I am so glad to have found this place. Coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first Italian place I've been to Toronto and I can say that my mom and I was satisfied!! Mom ordered Italian burger which she enjoyed for its tasty meat patty. I on the other hand ordered their spaghetti and stuffed meat balls, an ordinary italian pasta but a good one! I mean that's a start right? Nevertheless I will be coming back to try their other pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Usually I go to the Richmond hill location and I have to say that trying the Scarborough location was a mistake cause the service and food were both mediocre. We asked our server about our food 30 minutes after we ordered, reasonable right? We ordered two apps and two entrees. Our server replied \"the food will come out when it's ready\" ...what? As a server I would never tell my table that the food will be out when it's ready and as a customer would you like your server to address your concern with the obvious? I can see the disappointment in my servers face as she approached the tip left on the table. I don't blame my server for the pace that the food comes out but she should remember her job as a server is customer service."}
{"text":"I went to Scaddabush with my family last night. I had heard great things about it so I decided to give it a try. Their Fresh Mozzarella was delicious, the kids loved it! I ended up getting their Spaghetti and Meatball for my main as the server recommended it. Pasta was delicious and the meatball... Incredible. Overall great food and the service was great. I will definitely be back! Thank you Scaddabush!"}
{"text":"The squash ravioli was excellent. They have two versions of it (small and large) I had the large which is a regular serving at any other restaurant. Very good service with Mary."}
{"text":"The charity bread is the cheapest thing on the menu but it tastes amazing!

All the items i've tried so far were very good. Pizzas are my favorite. Nice place to take your date."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times, 
For starters I recommend the burrata ball, it is very tasty but very filling too. Their charity bread is delicious but overpriced.
If you are with someone, you should definitely take they \"social\" option, you get 2 medium sized meals in one !
Their pizzas are very tasty but very filling once again. the way they are served is interesting and you have a pair of scissors to cut them. 
I would definitely come back, perfect place for lunch/dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Went for my bro's birthday. We didn't have resos so we had to wait. No probs....but when we were seated there were so many empty tables. I get its a staffing issue but I hate when it happens..it's annoying to see as a guest. Server was great and food was good. The music tends to be very loud so it was very hard to have a conversation.

To be honest I miss the Alice fazoolis which used to be here."}
{"text":"Under cooked food (ordered the Arrabiata but could barely find any roasted mixed vegetables), delays even though the place was not crowded (served us melted ice cream for desert!!!), bad service (did not know the dishes well, barely saw the server... got the most prompt service when we asked for the bill)

Definitely not a place we're going to be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere! It's rare to go out somewhere this nice, love the dim lighting and rustic feel... Music could have been slightly quieter.

Food was excellent, service as well. Would eat here again(: 

Ps had the Napoli (no tomato)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food, great atmosphere and very clean. The best part was our waitress (Siobhan) hands down the best waitress ever! She was so nice and very knowledgeable. Would totally go to this place again."}
{"text":"My husband loves the pizza here. The pizza comes with giant scissors to cut it, which I guess is fun for your inner child. 

I have been here 3 times now and it's only okay. They boast about their mozzarella made in-house and it's flavourless. You have to dip it in the salt or jelly to taste anything. The texture is just like homemade cheese. It's not impressive. 

They also boast their homemade bread. So, I ordered one of the sandwiches that come with that bread. The bread was so hard it cut my gums. What's the point of making your bread in-house if its hard af? 

Their menu is ALL carbs, so you're low-carb or no-carb - this isn't the place for you. 

The last time I went there was for a birthday dinner. We were a large group, so they charged us a gratuity, which would've been fine if we all didn't wait over an hour for our meals. Our meals all arrived at different times, an hour after we placed the orders. A few people ordered steaks and they were all poorly made: medium steak was well-done and rare steak was medium. The pasta dishes were dry and we had to ask 3-4 times before our drinks were refilled. 

This place is not stroller-friendly at all. It was so tight just getting our stroller in the restaurant. 

Our services was so poor that one person in our party complained and they sent us free dessert. That was nice, but I don't think I'll ever return."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday. Food is a hit or miss. Half of our order was cold and the other half was tasteless. The best thing on the menu is the salmon. Staff is friendly and so is the manager but they really need to step up their food."}
{"text":"Everything I ate was delicious. The chicken avocado sandwich was super juicy, the caesar salad was fresh and tasty and the tiramisu was excellent. Not to mention that the service was great and we even met the manager who was extra friendly!"}
{"text":"Really like the food and ambiance and the freshly made cheese!  Personal favourites are penne arabiatta and pesto pollo pasta. Their pizzas are far from being authentic,  and I personally don't like the dough.  I would stick to the pastas and other items instead. The place is pretty packed on weeknights and weekends and reservations are highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always spot on and food is incredibly fresh. I had the house made mozzarella, the spinach beet and goat cheese salad and the tiramisu. Absolutely delish-def go back!"}
{"text":"Recently took my friend here for a birthday lunch. The staff was very attentive. Maybe even tooo attentive! So much that they would interrupt our conversation and start chatting with us - asking where we work, etc... I don't know, maybe I'm being picky, but most places when the server sees the patrons having a good time, they won't interrupt. Or they'll use the excuse of topping up your water to ask how you're enjoying the food and move on. Anyway, they were a little too friendly/nosy. 
Ok enough about the people. The food: it was great! We got the charity bread to start. Don't get this if you're on a diet. It's bread, dripping with butter and garlic. Or better yet, give yourself a cheat day and eat this bread. Mmm so good! I also got the butternut squash ravioli. It was soo good. I got the lunch size portion and thought it was just right. 
Overall, go have a great time. Eat the charity bread and enjoy. It's a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok so I previously loved this place. I just knocked off a star because I went here this past weekend and was a little disappointed. Every time I go, I always order the charity bread. This time, it was kinda dry and crusty. Then for my main I got the grilled cheese without the pancetta. They come with a side of rosemary garlic fries. Last time the grilled cheese was average. The fig jam wasn't evenly spread, the bread tasted stale, the fries were over salty. So much so that I had to send them back. This time things were better with the grilled cheese and fries. But the charity bread. My most favourite item on the menu, was terrible. The bread was stale. There's no way that was fresh. 
Service started off great, but ended on a disappointing note. My girlfriends and I were just chatting and catching up after we had dessert. The server came to us and told us she was leaving for the day so she was just brining us the bill. I got the sense that she just really wanted us to leave because about 30 mins later, we spot her serving another table! What?! We weren't there while it was busy. It was a Saturday afternoon, well before the dinner crowd would arrive so I'm not sure what that was all about. 
All in all, this place is starting to lack consistency. Please always use fresh bread. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fam and I came here on a Fri night- waited at the bar and tried Canadian beers on tap and they were aight (not much beer selection here, mostly wines). Sat outside on a summer night :)) our waiter was a pleasant dude who did a good job serving us. Skip the pastas- overcooked noodles and zero seasoning in the sauce, pizza was yummy- chewy crust and addicting herbs! 
Second visit we came for the pizza (it was that good) again before we left town- waitress was nice at first but was nowhere to be seen for the rest of the night and I had to literally go to the hostess to find her. Ordered calamari and the pizza again- calamari was a joke, it was cold, rubbery, and the sauce had huge chunks of garlic wtf? Pizza was good but not as good as the first time :( 
Overall this place is a hit or miss- if you happen to get a good waiter then you can overlook the mediocre food but when the service sucks and you pay $50 for 2 apps and 2 drinks...just no.
Note: we paid the bill with $100 US and they don't accept that (when asked why, they had no real answer) thankfully we had smaller bills but like...what were they going to do if we didn't lol stupid..."}
{"text":"I have been to Scaaddabush quite a few times and always enjoy the experience. The last time I visited this restaurant I ordered their thin crust 'Sophia' pizza with chicken, goat cheese, roasted peppers and it was amazing!  The pizza was perfectly baked and loaded with fresh ingredients. I really liked that they were quite generous with goat cheese making this dish super delicious. I also tried other items on the menu. Another of my favorite dishes to order here is the spinach and artichoke dip. Served warm with a side of thinly sliced toasted bread.  So good! This place is also really good at accommodating large groups. It's a large space with a beautiful patio."}
{"text":"The interior is quite striking (think: modern-rustic vibe)  and the ambience is good for large social gatherings (lively but not deafening). One notable feature of their menu is the \"social\" size serving option, for plates that can be shared between 3 or 4 people for a nice family-style dining experience.

Tip: Go for the fresh mozzarella, it's certainly worth it. I definitely appreciated the freshly-made pasta, but I'm taking one point off because I felt it could have used a tad bit more sauce. Also, the calamari was well-seasoned and presented with a incredibly tasty dipping sauce, but it was slightly overcooked.

Overall I would say this place is quite fun and worth a visit - but order their specialty (fresh mozzarella). The service is not the fastest, but it's casual and friendly.

Great place to relax and have a long meal with friends.

Another tip: Stay inside. The patio is beside a busy road and is not very pleasant."}
{"text":"2 words - MEAT. BALLS. (Or is that one word?) All of the food here is fantastic, the service is great, and the atmosphere is nice as well. It can get quite busy and loud on weeknights and weekends, but the food is worth the wait. Better yet, make a reservation and get your meatballs even faster. If you want some amazing Italian food, Scaddabush should be your first choice."}
{"text":"I love the food here!!! And the servers in the dining room are all so sweet. Make sure you leave room for dessert because the cheesecake there is absolutely delicious. We spent our family day here having dinner.  We loved our sever Flora she was very attentive  and answered all our questions to a T, she's awesome! Thumbs up over all ."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Scaddabush last night. The service was amazing. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming. So rarely am I blown away by service, but hers was fantastic."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it's excellent. 
Great atmosphere, food and service. 
Will come back soon."}
{"text":"I went once, had a bad experience, and went a second time because I was nearby and starving...also bad experience.  

For example:

*Server dropped a serving spoon into a dish of polenta.  Put his fingers into the sauce to retrieve the spoon, and then served it to us, and licked his fingers clean.  I've never seen that before, and I hope that until the end of my days I never see it again.  
*Ate with a vegetarian friend and ordered only meatless dishes.  Half of those were served with a meat sauce on them (no mention on the menu), so friend couldn't eat anything.
* Food was rather tasteless and bland.
* Multiple servers handle each table, so no one seems to know what anyone else is doing.  3 times servers asked us \"did Mandy get such-and-such for you?\"  Each time I asked, \"who is...?\"

Overall, it's bad food, incompetent service, and a general air of indifference.  Since it's on Yonge St maybe they target tourists who won't be back whether the food and service are good or bad, and hence the attitude of indifference.  I'd get a take-out slice of pizza before eating here again."}
{"text":"The food was average. It was good for what you were paying. The place is not over priced. I had the butternut squash ravioli with fried sage. It was the only good pasta on the menu. I've also had the pesto chicken it was nothing special. If you get the chance to order the fresh mozzarella they make it in house it's probably the best thing on the menu. The staff suck. Every time I have been the staff were slow and rude."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great environment, has a party-like vibe, with a DJ near the hostess choosing the music. The decor is rustic, with wooden chairs and tables, huge bar, tvs along the walls. Great place for fun drinks, but not so much for catch-up conversation. 

The restaurant makes their mozzarella and pasta daily in-house. I didn't try the mozzarella, but I did get to try their pasta. I had the Capri, and although the flavour and the seafood in the dish was delicious, the pasta was really overdone, to the point that it was a pile of mush, stuck together. When I told the waitress, she was more than friendly in taking it back to the kitchen, and taking it off the bill. That was probably the lowest point. 

Now, to everything else: The pizza was DELICIOUS! The dough was so soft and fluffy. The blood orange and cucumber mojito was SO good, and I would definitely try the bellinis next time. The tiramisu was a bit strong on alcohol taste, but still amazing nonetheless."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there just this past Saturday night. Service was great, food however was average. They put parmigiana on everything even though it's not stated \" sprinkled with parmigiana\" on menu; as most items on menu was specific with what you're getting. My problem with this is, both my boyfriend and I aren't fans of that cheese, we had to send back our food twice:( we felt bad but we wouldn't of been able to enjoy what we ordered. They should leave the extra \"add on's\" at the time of serving food and ask or have as an option as they do for Pepper. Overall the food quality wasn't the same as back in January-February this year ( it was fantastic then) I don't know if this was a one off or we just got lucky the first time when we were there earlier. I don't think I will go back again :("}
{"text":"This was an amazing recommendation by a concierge in the area. And he was right on. Amazing atmosphere and fun crowd. Homemade mozzarella and pasta are worth every penny! Nice wine list. This was our best meal while visiting in Toronto and will make sure to return on every return trip! Romantic and delicious. Fun and exciting."}
{"text":"Essentially has a similar menu to Alice Fazoolis that was located here before it opened but I'm not complaining. Has great ambience and atmosphere. Food is amazing everytime. I've ordered the penne arabiatta with shrimp and charity bread in the past. Not a fan of their bread but the penne was great! Fresh and tangy tomato sauce with bits of mozzarella melting in between really hit the spot. I've added a skewer of shrimp on more than one occasion that were grilled to perfection. 

My only gripe is that this place can get busy and the wait time are long unless you have a reservation so you can't just drop in. Also on more than one occasion the waiter that served us happened to be quite rude. He would rather flirt with the girls sitting at the bar-like seating out in the patio instead of serve us. Was very short with us and basically was just their for the tip."}
{"text":"Food is great and service got better as the meal went on. We came at an off time so we could have a quiet meal together, and instead the hostess proceeded to seat other tables immediately next to us. The restaurant was empty at 4:00pm and then suddenly there was a two top behind us conducting a business meeting and a table of 5 with a screaming child on either side of us. Not exactly the quiet meal we were hoping for. The food was very good. We had the stuffed meatball, Caesar salad, penne bolognese, and the burrata mozzarella with honey and truffle cream.  The fresh mozz was definitely the star of the show, but is only served after 5:00pm. Overall a great meal and we would definitely come back. I've recommended the restaurant to friends already."}
{"text":"Feels like....like....the restaurant that was there before.   But the food is much better.  We ordered the famous mozzarella to start and then Capri pasta and the veggie pizza.  

The mozzarella wasn't what we expected.  It seemed a bit hard...I guess I thought it would be softer and squishier.  The toast with the cheese was stale.    So to start our meal, we weren't impressed.   A table of three near us didn't eat even half of their mozzarella and sent it back.....I won't be ordering this again.   

The pasta was deeelicious!  Noodles were very tasty, cooked perfectly.  Seafood was abundant and not overcooked.  I loved this dish!

Pizza was a bit bready for me.  Personally, I like a thinner, chewier crust.   I ended up eating most of the pasta and boxing up the pizza for midnight snack.  

The table behind us of four were regulars and ordered four spaghettis and meatballs.   Next time that's exactly what I'm going to order!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill with friends food is fantastic and nice to see a DJ there playing old beats."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Mostly due to service.

Came with a group for a birthday party. After seating us late for our reservation, service was painfully slow.  Food took almost an hour to arrive. We asked where our appetizer was after 45 minutes and was informed it was coming with the mains, even though they never told us this ahead of time. It came after our mains.

They seemed very understaffed. Our waiter completely disappeared for most of the meal. My friend asked 4 times from 2 different people  for ketchup for his fries. By the time he got ketchup he was done the rest of his meal and fries were cold. My main was lukewarm.  Bills took 45 minutes to arrive after we asked. The waiter announced he was applying a discount  (one of us is a teacher) to everyone's bills.thats why we were waiting so long. But then this wasn't actually applied to the bills. Unimpressed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our visit to Scaddabush, but it would've been 5 stars if the service was even the least bit attentive.  Sat on the patio, had to wait and wait for water.  Almost went to sit inside the restaurant and looking back, it probably would've been a better experience. We ordered appetizers - the polenta tots were really good! Entrees were super tasty, had cavatappia, chicken limone and margarita pizza. I ordered the charity bread when I realized they didn't give you bread with your meal like some other restaurants do. It would've never came if I didn't ask another server about it. Refilling water was a constant issue, had to also ask other servers that happened by. We were going to get dessert, they have zeppole on the menu, but our server never came back after dropping off the menus. We had to go find him to get our check!!!! Overall, food was great and service not so much :("}
{"text":"Incredible...in a 27 degrees afternoon in the best patio of SQ1 area there are not enough waiters to attend the patio tables....so with half the patio tablrs available we have to seat inside.....if the food were not so good we would leave. Hopefully it does not happen again...what a lack of management eh?"}
{"text":"I went with family for dinner and it was the worst restaurant i have ever been to, the servers were the worst on earth, i really wonder how  this restaurant is still open and have customers. I would highly recomment to either change their staff completely or close for good.the food was cold and tasteless. Worst experience ever and would never go there again."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, 9.5/10. 

Went here with my gf and her friend during winterlicious 2016 and we all enjoyed the place, everything from the food to the service was great. 

Starters:
We had one of each, 
Olives, cheese and bread is good for 2 people to share. They don't cheap out and make it a 1 person app. 
Same with the bruschetta, good for 2. Both were served on large planks. 
I had the soup and it really tasted good, very flavourful and the real garlic bread in the soup makes it perfect. 

Mains:
Two of us had the penne, we both enjoyed it. Well cooked, sauce was good, right enough of spices. 
Gf had the chicken salad, she enjoyed it but we all agreed it was a bit of an overkill in arugula, she didn't finish it all as it was too much. 

Dessert:
We all had the toffee cake. It could have been warmer and more toffee (that's why I ordered it for the sponge toffee), there was a piece smaller than a teaspoon. The cake was good but could have been a bit better. 

Service:
Top notch. Took care of my nut allergy and was very prompt. We waited maybe 30 seconds from when the last plate was removed to the next meal but never felt rushed, we were there for easily 3 hours. Staff were really good too! Would definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Zeppoles! Go for these if nothing else! These are to be experienced, not described. We liked these so much we went back for more the next night (viva la vacation eating!). Possibly one of my all time favorite desserts. Yum!

Pros: Friendly staff, tomato fennel soup was amazing, ZEPPOLES! for crying out loud, cute presentation of dishes, decent menu variety, clever/eclectic upcycled decor, water bottle left on table, doodle paper on tables, good location. Didn't try the made fresh daily buffalo mozzarella or charity focaccia but they looked great.

Cons: The pizza my bf had was a bit bland, took a few attempts to flag someone down to get pepper flakes for the pizza, apple ravioli dessert wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Service was excellent from start to finish - server was very polite, attentive and food was served in a timely manner. 

What we ordered:
- Charity bread: delicious, will definitely order this again!
- Zucca (butternut squash ravioli): very flavourful, a lot more filling than it looks (was fine with a small), could have been served a little hotter
- Capri (a seafood pasta): very good, thought it could have used a little salt but still impressed

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and will be returning again in the future!"}
{"text":"The food was good, I got the lobster spaghetti. The lobster was a bit undercooked but doable. That was the best thing of this place... Okay, the music and decor was good too.

Service, however, was horrible. I feel liked our server didn't know what he was doing and might still have been new. It felt like he was the disgruntled son of a family friend bringing food out. 

When my food was late, granted I had a big party, but it was so late that he promised a discount. When I asked for my bill the discount was it was long and I had to inquire about it. He looked at me and was like, \"oh. Really?\" And when the credit card machine came, he took my card then walked off which was highly alarming since he shouldn't be going anywhere with my card. 

Then when he finally came back, he swore out loud when the machine didn't work then walked away again. I don't mind swearing, but I expected more professional behaviour.

Another server came to help us after she noticed it took a long time for us to get our food man she was great.

Overall, I might come back to try the other food but the service was zero stars... Maybe one because the other server recognised that we were in need of service."}
{"text":"Great food, poor service. The females in the front are quite rude, they dont really care to serve you. Especially the female with the mole."}
{"text":"I've only been to this restaurant once and as a forewarning, I am generally biased towards any type of Italian food so you will rarely see a bad review of an Italian place from me. 
To start, I had the \"Classico Bruschetta\" which I absolutely loved. To be fair, I have not had a lot of experience eating bruschetta so what I experienced may be fairly standard. I found the infusion of the chopped tomatoes with, what I am assuming to be, a sweet balsamic vinegar very savoury and slightly acidic (which I love). I also appreciated how the bread was not very hard.
The main dish that I ordered was the \"Penne Bolognese\", a standard dish found everywhere. I found the penne to be soft and substantial which I appreciated since softer penne can sometimes feel thinner to me. The bolognese sauce was fairly standard and didn't really blow my mind or anything. However, I would rank it on the higher side of average (if that's a thing), as it still hit the spot (and for a very reasonable price point).
I would definitely recommend this restaurant and look forward to eating here again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. A little underlying pressure to order appys and desserts , but other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"Soft pasta, fresh mozzarella has been consistent. You can opt for melted mozzarella but I think naked is the way to go (can also come with prosciutto).

I've been here four times, two different locations and always get the naked mozzarella, I never skipped it since. 

Ambience is live, design feels modern rustic. You can watch the game from here or sit at a long table and have a good time with friends.

Service is good, sometimes they can be busy and it can feel like food is taking forever, but when it gets to you, it doesn't disappoint

I once got the polenta. It came with an abundant amount of mozzarella in a plate too big. The plating was pretty however but I felt like the plate can be smaller. 

I ordered a side of mushrooms(off the menu) and found it watery. The flavour was good, and the garlic could be a bit more for my liking. I'll keep in mind to say extra garlic next time. 

The pizza was rectangle and thought it was fun. If you're not a fan of goat cheese keep in mind to read every ingredient on the pizza you're about to order. If you like goat cheese, this should be good news for you

The pasta was soft, I can't remember which one I got but I still remember the texture up to this day. I would get the pasta again if I want something filling if I know the mozzarella cheese won't satisfy me. 

I've seen a variety of cute desserts, I don't think any of them will disappoint. I wanted to get one to try for myself but I was already so full. They have alamode type of desserts or layered desserts in small size mason jars

There is no parking lot for this restaurant but possible to park somewhere else (can be pricey)"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at this location and I still didn't enjoy my experience here. I came with a large group of eight again and the service is just incredibly slow for mediocre food. Appetizers were just okay. I've had the charity bread - essentially bread soaked in butter, mozzarella and bread which was good and the avocado goat cheese bruschetta which was also good. Their pasta doesn't wow me and the portion is quite small. I also tried the steak which was also very small and although asking for medium it was quite medium rare. For dessert I was excited to try the gelato but when I tasted it, I realized it was just vanilla ice cream. The waitress even asked how my ice cream was... I thought I ordered gelato. The wait time for food was so long for both times I've been. The most I waited was an hour for mains. For dessert at least a half hour wait considering there isn't much baking or cooking involved... Mainly just assembling food or in my case, scooping ice cream from a tub. The \"gelato\" was also going for $6.95. Not sure if all locations are like this but I'm definitely not coming back. Try reds tavern right next door for a better meal."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. We waited very long for our dish and it was cold when it was delivered. They also served the bread ordered after we were more than half way done our meal. Flavour wise wasn't that great either, I had the Capri pasta the mussels were not very fresh. The chicken limone was so dry that we couldn't even cut. We also waited 10 min to pay our bills. It's lunch time on a Friday, then restaurant was not so busy. It's like we were forgotten."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon & egg pizza which was to die for and the tiramisu reminded me of my trip to Italy! And our server, Taylor was very friendly and attentive! I would definitely recommend the restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush, you were a brilliant Mother's Day choice. Thank you to our kind waiter who served a jam-packed section but never lost his cool. Thank you to the folks who produce fresh pasta every day. Thank you to the person who makes the meatballs the size of baseballs. Just wow, thank you guys.

We can't wait to try the Yonge and Gerrard location next!

Tip: These are big portions! Don't be fooled by the price tag. Share with someone if you can, and you'll have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Pasta is always good and the meatball is to die for. Tuscan salad is really tasty."}
{"text":"This place is sort of like an upscale East Side Mario's or Alice Fazooli's. I had the americano pizza and a glass of malbec. Both were amazing but the food took a good 30 minutes or so to come out. We had a group of 7 and this was on a Sunday at lunch time. It wasn't busy at all. We had Leith as our waiter who was excellent, despite it being only his 3rd shift in the job. Would come back one day, but not is a rush."}
{"text":"It was alright... kind of underwhelming. We are currently here for a birthday gathering, and to be honest it's a hit or miss depending on what you order. I personally ordered the Zucca Ravioli for myself and the Penne Carbonara for my boyfriend. Since I don't eat meat or seafood, I thought the Zucca would be a good choice. I just didn't like it. It was weirdly sweet and tasted like a spoiled dessert in my mind. However, others loved it ! I think it's based on personal tastes & preferences. The menu does say that it tastes like that, so just know that the taste is really nutty and sweet. In regards to the salad, my mom and another family member ordered salad three/four times, and they were sent back repeatedly. My moms salad and the other salad was brown. So she ended up not getting anything. The fries are good, and the Penne Carbonara seems like it tastes really good (I tried a piece). Service is good, the waiters and waitresses were nice. Just know that It's just extremely busy, and extremely loud ! All in all - not bad but not great. It fresh pasta but really it tastes like a good boxed pasta brand. OH! Cheese galore. You get pasta? Ask for cheese. You get a salad? Ask for cheese. They really don't stop until you tell them to. It's great."}
{"text":"Oh where do I begin? It was a chilly December day and I had no idea I was about to meet the love of my life - Zucca Ravioli. I hesitated briefly over which size to choose and ended up going for regular. Lemme tell ya, I'm glad I did. It was foodgasm after foodgasm and I wasn't faking. If yours truly is ever on death row, this is going to be my last meal. 

They also have 3 types of Sangria: red, white and green. I had a very generous glass of the green and it was delightful.

Great service as well! The restaurant was pretty busy on a Friday evening, but it felt like our waiter only took care of our table. Can't wait to chill on their patio when the summer rolls around. Ciao, Zucca! Amore mio!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I really want to love this place. I first visited the College Street location and everything was great. I just found out they opened a Scarborough location and I was so so disappointed. My fiance and I went there on Family day in the evening to enjoy a nice dinner together. We ordered Calamari to start was great, their famous bread - amazing, my fiance ordered the seafood pasta and myself the penne bolognese. Everything was great until I got home and went to bed and woke up at midnight to find myself extremely sick and puking the rest of the evening. Horrible food poisoning from this location and unfortunately I will never ever go here again."}
{"text":"First of all, amazing customer service next to amazing food. Italian speciality and freshness is what this place is all about. The cozy and classy interior of this restaurant is what stood out to me the most. We were given traditional plates, water in mason jar's and the presentation was beautiful. The spinach dip is a MUST, it's so creamy and cheesy. The pasta's, flatbread and fresh mozzarella was amazing! We also tried their fries and they were so good. I would skip the Garlic Bread if you don't like buttered down breads."}
{"text":"I haven't even had the opportunity to go to Scaddabush yet... But I did call on Saturday night to make a reservation for the next week. I was told to call the next morning because \"there's a bit of a rush\". How else does one make a reservation? Isn't that the role of the person answering the phone? - to take reservations? Kind of frustrating. Let me try to remember to call tomorrow..."}
{"text":"3 stars. The Americano pizza was great. The service was horrible. As I usually travel alone I sit at the Bar for faster service and so I can watch sports. The bartender who I will not say her name was more worried about her phone and cleaning up like she was trying to get off work that she ignored the 4 patrons at the bar. Don't ask for a second glass of water as well. You don't want it slammed in front of you. Usually comming to Toronto for business I look forward to this place."}
{"text":"Having gone to Scaddabush twice in the past two weeks when it first opened, I was quite impressed with the revamping of what once was Alice Fazoolis. The service was great, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. The general manager even stopped by our seat, probably because of proximity, and put two of our desserts on the house after just making some small talk with us for a few minutes, explaining the concept behind the restaurant. The meatballs were superb, and I was impressed with their hand-made mozzarella and house made fresh pasta. The salads are mediocre, but the mozzarella, pasta, and pizza were all surprisingly delicious, considering it's a chain restaurant. It's a great restaurant if you're just looking for a fun night with delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"I went here with my Mom tonight for dinner and it was excellent. We were seated at one of the communal tables and it got a bit crowded and loud, but that is to be expected on a busy night. Even with people on all sides it was a really nice atmosphere, what with the candles, the rustic tables and accents, and the mood lighting. I really liked the decor!
The food was excellent and came quickly. I got a caesar - really good house dressing, perfect amounts of bacon and croutons (I NEED croutons!! For caesar fans, you know - bacon/lettuce/crouton ratio is important!). We shared the the osso bucco bites (pork and papparedelle crisps) and the Zucca pasta (butternut squash ravioli). The details were really what made these dishes memorable. The Osso Bucco bites were really well cooked and mixed well with the crisps. They have a sweetness that is really tasty and subtle. The butternut squash ravioli were also delicious - I loved the addition of fried sage and the hazelnut butter cream sauce. My only comment is that they felt a little heavy - I was pretty full after eating 6 (we split a \"large\" platter). 
Service was amazing. Quick, super friendly. I got lost finding the bathrooms (they're upstairs! Yes!) and a bunch of servers were super nice when giving directions. Normally bewildered customers blocking up busy pathways don't get treated with such kindness (ha, fair) so I was impressed!
I'm definitely going back soon to try the meatballs."}
{"text":"Came here with some girlfriends on Wednesday night. Ordered the fig jam mozzarella and baked carbonara. The fresh mozzarella was pretty tasty. A bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth trying. My carbonara was ok, a little too peppery and found that it wasn't creamy enough. It had some fresh shaved green onion though, which added an interesting taste to the pasta. Atmosphere and service was good. Good place to come with groups."}
{"text":"5/5 for ambience and service
3.5/5 for taste
3/5 for price
I always enjoy the rustic feel and ambience of scaddabush. I have a few favourites: the spinach and artichoke dip is the best ever, the seafood pasta as well as the pizza taste delicious. Their bread and cheese are so fresh and flavourful as well. I would love for them to diversify their vegetarian options more! In desserts, their cheesecake is my favourite- very creamy, rich and with the perfect hazelnut base. It usually average to 25-30$ per person."}
{"text":"Super restaurant ! Très copieux. Mozzarella sympa. Raviolis au potiron magnifiques! Même pas pu finir la portion small !"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Saturday and had a great experience! Overall, the service was impeccable, and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend!! 

When we first walked in there were only one or two tables that was having lunch, which was surprising because we came on a Saturday. But the hostess promptly seated us, and asked if we wanted the high top tables. We were hesitant so she offered to seat us at the booth towards the back of the restaurant right away. We decided it was a bit too dark for lunch so asked if we could sit at the high tops instead. She was not annoyed in the slightest and accommodated us right away. Our server was very friendly, genuine without being too pushy at all. She was very kind and took the time to explain to us the menu and had answers to every question we had.

Between my guest and I we ordered the charity bread (a square piece of flatbread but into little cubes sprinkled with rosemary, the most delicious garlic paste, and olive oil on a iron skillet), the calamari, seafood Alfredo, and their Italian burger.
The charity bread is amazing, texture was a little bit on the hard side, but the strong garlicky flavour really stood out without being too pungent or sharp (I'm a huge garlic fan so I'm most likely biased.
My Italian burger actually came on a flat bread instead of a regular burger bun like I expected. Very flavourful, the patty was charred to perfection, and the slice of fried mozzarella on top is just amazing. Even the side salad it came with was super fresh. I am not usually a balsamic vinaigrette fan because most places make it way too tart, but the vinaigrette they used is just right, and tasted like it was made in house.
My guest had the seafood Alfredo, portion was plenty, no complaints there :)
The only reason I took down one star from this review was the calamari. I thought it had a rubbery texture, and was not very hot when it was served. It was good but I've definitely had better. I would advise skipping the calamari and trying their speciality mozzarella balls as an appetizer next time.

Again, the service was truly excellent and really blew me away. Our server was courteous and made sure to check back on us at least 2 times after our food was served to make sure we were all set. She made us feel that she truly cared about whether we were having a good experience which I truly appreciated, knowing that it is not easy to come by nowadays in Toronto. 

Price wise, around $30 per person with no drinks, one entree and two appetizers to share. Definitely affordable. I'm very interested to see how the vibe would be for dinner service. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian there's always more limited options but their zucca ravioli was sooo good. I've been here twice, once the service was great, the other was definitely slow but I was with a group and we were in no rush that time so it didn't bother me all that much."}
{"text":"Extra information:

* 2 locations
* Takes reservation
* Family friendly
* good for big group gathering
* Serves alcohol

Seems like a lot of restaurants are opening up around Yonge and Gerrald area which is great, I do like to stay on Yonge street even when I hang out in downtown since it is a lot easier to get around.
If you ever drove to downtown.. you probably know why I like to stick to subway instead of paying $20 for parking.

Since I've been to Reds Midtown Tavern many times ever since it opened and had an awesome experience every time, I was more than happy to check out Scaddabush that opened up next door.

When I walked in, I was quite impressed by the size and decor of the restaurant. I was expecting more of a 'hip' vibe since it is on Yonge street, but I walked into something more family-friendly and I loved it.
I really loved all the caramel colored wooden tables and chairs and the feeling of dining at your Italian granma's house (even if you ain't Italian!)

There were lots of things on the menu I wanted to try but had to hold back since there were only 2 of us dining there that night.

Ordered: Fresh Mozzarella 3/5

* With extra virgin olive oil, truffle oil and focaccia crostini for $12.00
* This is something made fresh daily in house between 5pm and 9pm
* I was excited about trying this and sadly it didn't impress me that much
* Mozarella cheese was creamy and fresh, but the truffle oil didn't add much flavor

Ordered: Charity Bread 1/5

* Crusty Italian bread, rosemary, garlic and lots of butter. Freshly baked and proceeds go to local charity for $2.00
* How can you go wrong with fresh baked bread with lots of garlic and butter? very wrong in my case
* When it arrived, it smelled amazing but once I cut into the bread I realized there was something wrong
* The bread was stale! I could tell it was at least day old and it was just not pleasant
* Later I asked the restaurant manager if they bake it in house and then she told me they get it from somewhere. So I asked where they get their bread from and she went to the kitchen to ask and came back with an answer 'apparently nobody seems to know'
* Long story short, I find that ridiculous how the restuarant manager couldn't even answer where they get their bread from, especially when it is served on their main menu.

Ordered: Baked Carbonara 3/5

* Parmesan cream ssuce, smoked bacon, scallions, garlic, black pepper, soft poached egg with fresh penne for $14.57
* Online menu says they offer small and large, but downtown location only offers large size for baked carbonara
* Overall I enjoyed this pasta dish, it doesn't look that big when you first see it but the portion is quite big
* There weren't much sauce and overall it was a little dry
* I think it might be better to stick with tomato sauce based pasta

Ordered: Parmesan Chicken 4/5

* Panko breadcrumb, fresh mozzarella, SCADDABUSH spice, served with fresh spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce for $17.24
* This is a dish my friend ordered which was probably the best out of everything we ordered that night
* Parmesan chicken was flavorful with just the right amount of breadcrumbs
* Fresh spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce was enjoyable but a little over-cooked

Summary: Just based on my dinner experience at Scaddabush this night, I left very unpleased. Overall, the food was acceptable and the service was good but just the fact that the best answer they could give me about where they get their bread was 'nobody seems to know', as if they could just pretend it was a joke and not even a legit question. However, besides the bread drama- overall food at Scaddabush was alright and would be nice for a family dinner our. 
Am I in a hurry to go back? not really. I don't really care to dine at a restaurant where they don't take their food seriously and can't even answer a simple question."}
{"text":"I love this place, tasty and good quality food, friendly staff and over all great environment. I would totally recommend this restaurant if you are in for some Italian food. I gave it 4 stars because I think that their salad can be improved, to be fair I only tried one (the beet one)!"}
{"text":"My gf worked in the area and had a coupon for 25% off at Scaddabush. Loved the way the placed looked, excellent service and interesting menu. It does look higher end (some reviews say that it ties to look high end but it isn't - I personally didn't feel that and actually felt like I was in a truly high-end place). 
The only reason I didn't rate it 5 star were the prices. Quite on the high side. Again, it could be their attempt to cater to the higher level workers in the area, but ultimately my gf and I shared a meatball (it was relatively large with excellent beef quality) and a beet salad. Both delicious - but because we shared we weren't really that full, and even with the 25% discount I still felt that the price was relatively high given what I have eaten..."}
{"text":"I've been to two other locations for Scaddabush, the original on Gerrard and Yonge is still the best. Here the service was verrrryyy slow. Not enough staff working during the dinner and holiday rush. The food was good, as always, but they can definitely improve on their customer service. Our pasta dishes got cold as we waited for staff to get us plates for sharing. We had the butternut squash ravioli, butcher pizza, and snapper fish as mains. The butternut squash is still a personal fav. The caprese salad was very good too! The mozzarella is made in house - very fresh!"}
{"text":"Loved the gnocchi. Was disappointed that the chicken was pretty dry.. I wouldn't have enjoyed this dish if it weren't for the soft, chewy gnocchi. 

I recommend ordering the Polenta Tots. These are a must when you visit Scaddabush!

In terms of service, it was decent and our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't go on Sunday...we stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try. The food was good, however, it took a minute to decide what food I wanted, and what food they actually had in the kitchen. Apparently Sunday is their 'let everything run out' day. The server actually told us this. Both of these things are completely strange to me...1. you have a 'run out of everything day' at all in the restaurant industry. Are you trying to go out of business? 2. that the server was all to happy to tell us of this fact was bizarre as well.

My boyfriend is a tank so he liked his spaghetti but I have no reason to return to a place that doesn't mind losing their sunday business, and actually schedules it that way..."}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing ambient and food, nice location and workers, make sure you call ahead"}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place for some time now and finally went.  Not exactly by choice (I personally prefer going to locally owned restaurants vs. chain restaurants), but it was alright.  Service was friendly, though it was empty. Hopefully the service is just as friendly on their busy times.

The best part about my first experience here was their fresh mozzarella.  The waitress recommended their new one that had crushed pistachio and a balsamic dressing.  It was absolutely delicious and also quite filling, especially with the crustinis. If you love cheese, this is definitely a must try.  I'd go back just for this. 5/5.

Spaghetti and Meatball - Since it was my friend's treat, I ordered the same thing she ordered and it was the spaghetti with one giant meatball.  We opted for the stuffed one.  This thing was huge.  The meatball was stuffed with chorizo and cheese, so it was pretty heavy.  I didn't even eat half of it.  Sauce itself was alright and the spaghetti could've been a little more al dente.  Dish was good but nothing too extraordinary.  3/5."}
{"text":"Our meal was surprisingly very good!!! I had the pasta sorrentina regular size, which is enough for two people!   
We were here during dinner time on a friday and the service was very fast. Our waitress was also very nice!  
The small patio is cute, and very clean!
The only bummer was the garlic rosemary fries, 5.00 and they are about the size of a small mcdonalds fries, no garlic or rosemary flavor."}
{"text":"Love  the fresh mozzarella.  Make  sure you  make  reservations  if you are heading there  for  dinner.  Decent  selection of  pizzas"}
{"text":"Honestly, it wasn't good. I miss Alice Fazooli's. Went here for mother's birthday. Seated on the SMALLEST table they could find for 5 people, with the most UNCOMFORTABLE chairs. We could barely fit our food on the table, and we were seated beside other people.. (no privacy). Food was mehh."}
{"text":"After trekking out to try to get ramen we were faced with a long line. Having tried Scaddabush in Richmond Hill we immediately suggested to go with our 2 other companions.  While they were almost fully booked for dinner at around 7pm we still managed to get a table. Our servers Amanda and Alex get a special mention for taking care of us so well. We got the prosciutto mozzarella of course,  and our companions loved it! Along with some charity bread it was enough to stop the hangry We got for dinner: spaghetti to share with some stuffed meatballs,
 a small pan of carbonara, 
 the Butcher pizza,
And we were all so stuffed! Fresh pasta and tasty sauces made us so content we were glad about not getting ramen for once. 
Plus our companions mentioned how this might be their to go to date night place,  thanks Scaddabush!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, beautiful patio, cool vibe, decent food... Love burrata, chicken Parmesan bite. Didn't like their calamari fritti (was hard and salty). Their salad and pizza menu are just ok in my opinion. I didn't love any of them. Tried several pasta and all are pretty delicious. Best part: the white Sangria @ their summer patio"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The spinach artichoke dip is amazing. The pollo pasta is my favourite. I enjoyed the mango peach Bellini. Can't go wrong going here. Service is great even during busy hours."}
{"text":"If your looking for a decent place for Italian then this is the place.

Dined here twice. Always packed especially end of week so prepare for the wait. Visited this location for the first time soon after opening this past summer. Meeting with coworkers we landed patio seating at a communal table- whimsical with candle lit tables. Second time in the dining area.

First visit:
Mozzarella- made fresh daily in house- a must for a starter!

Primavera pizza $15- grilled zucchini, eggplant, roasted red peppers, grape tomatoes, and red onions. Disappointing to say the least. Both my friend and I ordered pizza  once I started eating it, the pizza was doughy, thick, and undercooked. In comparison with my friends, the two pizza's were not alike. I flagged down my server and said the pizza was inedible. She apologized and agreed that the pizza was thicker than usual and put in another order. In the meantime, I tried my friends Sophia pizza. Order this one- chicken, goat cheese, roasted red peppers and caramelized onions. After some time, I received the second order and it was good but wouldn't recommend as it lacked flavour. If your opting for a non meat option this is not one to order.

Scaddabush had a promo for their grand opening however the server was unaware. Our table had to wait a good 15 minutes for the manager to direct the server how to process the payment. I wasn't overtly bothered by this as I realized they had just opened. Not a great first impression though.

Second visit:
Goat cheese and beet salad $13- typically never order salad's as I can't justify the price but found myself not uber hungry. The salad had the perfect amount of balsamic lemon vinaigrette- can't stand salads drenched in dressing! Complimented with pears, walnuts, cranberries, and a generous helping of goat cheese served on a bed of spinach/arugula. Love me a good ole beet salad!

Extensive wine list- reasonably priced.

All in all if your in the area and chain restaurants are your choices this one is a good option."}
{"text":"Yeah so this is what you call the typical jack astors or eastside marios type of spot. The inside design is very beautiful and has a semi casual type of setting  . I suggest you try the butternut squash ravioli. Another good thing to do is call ahead and make reservations"}
{"text":"Loved the food (calamari, bruschetta, pizza) service and atmosphere.  Reasonable prices for what you get. Large harvest tables are great for groups.  Plates are a perfect size for sharing.  The cocktails all sound fantastic, and taste good, but everything is just way too sweet to drink too much of.  Would be much better if they weren't so concentrated."}
{"text":"Great food and even better ambiance. Too bad the line ups take half your evening. It's super busy but I would definitely recommend this place over the restaurants beside it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch last weekend and the restaurant was surprisingly empty. We were seated immediately at the back of the restaurant, which was probably the reason why service was excruciatingly slow.

Our server was incredibly sweet but for most of the meal, we had no idea where she was. There was only three other tables occupied, so I didn't understand why our food took forever as well.

Maybe they were taking their time to perfect the dish? Doesn't taste like it - The brick chicken literally tasted like a brick, tough and overcooked on the edges. The pasta was also soggy and overcooked.. Clumpy mush would be a nice way to describe it. My friends burger patty looked like it sat I the sun for a week - It was so visibly dry, it looked unappetizing. 

This was my first time at Scaddabush, and probably my last."}
{"text":"Ive only ever come here for lunch. They have a great lunch menu. I got a pizza that came with a cracked egg on top and it was by far one of the best pizzas Ive ever had. The decor in this place is wonderful, weve had friendly staff everytime weve come and they also have a rollup door by the patio so we got to sit beside it when it was raining and still stay dry. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Very bustling atmosphere during dinner time. See the pictures. 

I couldn't decide between Grilled Chicken Limone and Grilled Chicken Shrimp. I asked my waiter and he recommended me to get the latter one without any hesitation. It was more expensive so I kinda expected the answer. Anyhow, I decided to go for it and it was alright. It was nothing like \"HOLY F!!! I'M MIND-BLOWN\" but it was ok.. I felt like it was a bit overpriced but still... it was ok... it deserved at least 3 stars but I gave them 4 stars because um....If you're interested.. keep reading..

After ordering my main meal, I could sense that it wouldn't be enough to fulfill my spoiled stomach. After peering into a menu for approx. 15 minutes since ordering the Grilled Chicken Shrimp pasta thingy, I decided to add two of their side dishes to compensate my 'somewhat expected' bland main dish: french fries and mushrooms. 

Just like the main menu, both french fries and mushrooms were alright.. The mushrooms were pretty oily though. All the dishes I tasted were nothing out of this world. You could make those at home with cheaper price tag but nowadays, many restaurants are garbage so..  clap clap. They all deserved 3 stars for sure in my opinion. 

Anyways, as I said, the reason I ordered those sides dishes was because I kinda knew my main dish would somewhat taste bland for me.. The french fries came after about 30 minutes of ordering it.. it was brought to me really late (literally at least 30 minutes +)but I was calm. However, as I was about to finish my main meal...one of my side dishes(mushrooms) still didn't come out. I was confused at first and couldn't really finish the meal because of it. When I was searching for my waiter to see what's up, I noticed that it was so bustling with only few waiters trying their best to make things work. At this point, I knew they forgot my order. I was finally able to grab my waiter's attention and a different waiter (he seemed more like a manager or some sort..) approached me with apologetic facial expression.. I told him that I'd like to just cancel the mushrooms because I was almost done with my meal and there was no point getting it at this point, but he told me that he could give it for free... I was like \"What? Really?? Sure then..\"

What really surprised me was that when I received my bill, both of my side dishes were not calculated.. I was just expecting the mushrooms to be free but also the french fries?! Wow.. what a customer service... 

I was so flattered that despite the discount, I gave my main waiter more than the average tip.

To sum up: Ok dishes(2.5~3 stars). Great customer care(1 more star added).

PS: Also tried their cocktail (Lemon Rosemary Smash) and it was ok.. You're not gonna get drunk so keep that in mind. Not sure how to describe it better than by just saying it was ok.. Try it for yourself. I bet you'd feel the same.. just ok.. It seems like everything here is just ok..."}
{"text":"A friend told me about Scaddabush a year ago, but living on the east end of the city, I put off trekking to the west end until now. I have been missing out!!!

My friend and I shared the Charity Bread, Goat Cheese & Beet Salad, Straight Up Meatball, and Zeppoles. We loved every single dish! 

Charity Bread - I love garlic and butter. Each piece of this bread had just the right amount to keep you wanting more with every bite. It came out nice and warm with the butter melted throughout the loaf and had a slightly crispy bottom that gave it a nice crunch. This was highly recommended by my friend and several reviews, I'm going to have to agree, your experience at Scaddabush will not be complete without it. 

Goat Cheese & Beet Salad - We indicated that we would share this and asked our waitress if she could bring us an extra plate when it came out. Instead, she came out with the salad split on both plates - both were plated for presentation not a haphazard split. I thought this was exceptional customer service. The walnuts tasted fresh. I think the cranberries are candied or something, they are not the crappy store bought Oceanspray cranberries that get thrown in. 

Straight Up Meatball - I shared this with my friend, it can easily be shared with up to four people to allow everyone to try more dishes. The meatball is fairly large, so you definitely want to share this so you can try their other amazing dishes.

Zeppoles - I'm pretty sure these came fresh out, they were still a bit hot when we got them (not complaining!) which made it that much better with the chocolate sauce they serve it with. 

Lastly, I just wanted to say that we received outstanding service from our waitress. I eat out quite frequently and it has been a long time since I have received such good service. A smile on her face every time she came by, patience, timely service and offered to refill our jug of water if we intended to sit and chat for longer on the patio after we had paid. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant for my nephew's bday and had a blast. The service was top notch and the apps were spectacular. The portions for the salads and pastas were quite generous. However, sandwich meals (including the burger) were a bit on the small side. The taste of all sandwiches ordered at our table were amazing and to be honest the sandwiches were big ... I just wish we had more of their yummy fries to munch on. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for date night type thing when downtown with my boyfriend. Didn't know it would be so packed but wait time was short so no problems there. We were seated up against the far wall across from the bar. My boyfriend wasn't super pleased with where we were sitting but I thought it was alright, and me, judging the whole atmosphere, I thought it was quite lovely. 

Our server was so quick outgoing and courteous; Since we had never been there before she gave us a quick rundown of the menu; and also was super quick refilling water throughout the night. 

I got the Chicken Parmesan 
sandwich with a caprese salad, and my boyfriend got the Sophia pizza, and we had the Classico bruschetta to start; and we both had water to drink. A problem for me was not seeing any non alcoholic drinks on the menu (except for 3 virgin drinks) and I wasn't in the drinking mood so it was a bit of and issue with me. But water was fine.

My boyfriend didn't try my sandwich but I thought  it was quite good. Honestly some solid hunger crushing food. It was spicy due to the hot peppers (which I personally liked) but be warned if hot food isn't your thing. 
Onto the Sophia pizza.
My boyfriend and I both agreed that it was really good as well. Super tasty & the crust was great.
The bruschetta was lovely as well; I thought it was extremely fresh and well made- a great starter, which came out quickly (as well as the rest of our food did) which was also a plus.

The music (maybe just because of where we were sitting) was pretty loud, so be forewarned. I didn't want to have to raise my voice to speak/lean across the table but I did. So basically my boyfriend and I couldn't /really/ hear each other speaking, and when the waitress came to take our orders or ask how we were doing, couldn't hear her super well either... But, we managed. The music choice itself though was good in my opinion, a good amount of variety of older, and new.

Overall this place was at least a solid 4-4.5 stars out of 5. Just because of my boyfriends feelings about the atmosphere, the music volume and not seeing any soft drinks/pop on the drinks menu."}
{"text":"Delicious Tuscan salad with grilled chicken.  A healthy lunch option when trying to keep it lean at this tempting restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian food, service was great too.   Wanted desert, but was just too full.   Enjoyed the entire meal, not rushed food prepared fresh and served hot!"}
{"text":"I have been to Scaddabush twice, and my initial impression has been confirmed. The food is very fatty, salty and sugary and that doesn't leave you feeling good afterwards. I won't be back, unless someone I know is having a birthday there and I have no choice. Here's a rundown on what I had:

NAKED Fresh Mozzarella
\"Extra-virgin olive oil, San Marzano tomato jam, sea salt, focaccia crostini\" 

I ordered this dish because the menu said: \"Fresh mozzarella is made-to-order between 5pm and 11pm, every day. You can even watch it being made. Ask your server who is making it tonight.\" How exciting! The dish looked nice when it arrived but looks are deceiving. Fresh Mozzarella is supposed to semi-soft and elastic in texture and creamy in flavour. What I tasted was bland and rubbery. I have been taking an 8 week cheese appreciation course so I have learned what good Mozzarella should taste like. The crostini were stale (just because you toast the hell out of something, you aren't going to fool me). The San Marzano tomato jam tasted nothing like its namesake, only of cloying sugar. There was very little evidence of cracked black pepper or olive oil, as you can see from my photo. 

Zucchini Fritti
\"Lightly battered fried zucchini strips, warm tomato sauce dip, topped with chili Parmesan\"

These fritters were so light on the zucchini and so heavy on the batter, they should have been called Batter Fritti. They were so soaked in oil that it was pretty impossible to taste anything but oil. The grated cheese was for show, as it was totally flavourless. Thank goodness for the tomato sauce and the few slices of red chili pepper that came with. The sauce was thick, tomato-y and nicely Italian-spiced. The red chili pepper provided a nice but teeny zing. 

Zucca Ravioli
\"Butternut squash ravioli, Grana Padano, hazelnut butter cream sauce, fried sage, poor man's Parmesan\"

Main flavours were sweet and fat which was not surprising. When I looked up the nutritional facts on Scaddabush's website, 748 out of the dish's 911 calories came from fat."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. 
Been here multiple times and although sometimes everything from food to servers are great, there have been many times where things were lacklustre and due to the long wait times, I opted to not have them fixed. 

Drinks/cocktails are alright. Nothing phenomenal but definitely not horrible."}
{"text":"Come here often. They have many gluten free options - pasta, pizza. Delicious food. The sangria is to die for in the summer."}
{"text":"Great food ! Great service! A bit expensive but you get what you pay for. Love this place !"}
{"text":"I have been here on 3 different ocassions and all 3 times the food has been amazing.

today we sat on the patio and had great service. He had the Italian burger which was great. we shared the spinach dip. I had the prosciutto grilled cheese. it was so amazing!

love it!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place! The decor is great and the patio is awesome! I love the flowers and plants all around. I wish the food was better! It just seems bland. I feel like my spaghetti and meatballs taste way better than theres. The only dish we love at this place is the artichoke dip! It seemed to have the most flavour! I wish they gave more bread with it though. They only give you four pieces. I think six would be great!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Canada and I was looking for a new place to try. My friend and I came across this restaurant on Yelp and thought we would give it a shot. When we walked up there, the DJ had the music going and everybody looked as if they were having a great time! 90s R&B and hip hop were on the playlist outside and there was a different playlist for the inside. I couldn't help but dance as I was walking in the door. 

Though they appeared to be crowded, we were immediately seated and greeted by our waitress. She took no time to bring us water and provided us with cocktail recommendations. Her recommendations were amazing btw. Our drinks came very quickly and our waitress gave us a complete rundown of the menu complete with recommendations and a descriptions of the foods and the flavor. I highly recommend their mozzarella and bruschetta. Both of them were AMAZING. Our food came out very fast and our server made sure that she checked on us frequently despite how busy she appeared to be."}
{"text":"Is it abnormal to get a grilled cheese at an Italian restaurant? I mean, I was hesitant at first but thank Christ I did.

The Prosciutto Cotto Grilled Cheese (with prosciutto cotto, caramelized onions, mozzarella & fig jam) is the best sandwich I've eaten in MONTHS. Good god, was it tasty. Tip? Get it with a side of their tomato fennel soup for an experience you're probably not worthy of.

DAMMNIT, it's good."}
{"text":"Awfully loud inside during dinner time, service wasn't very fast, food was decent but nothing to write home about. Overall pretty mediocre experience"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have ever frequented. Ordered the Italian meatball with pasta, flavourless and boring. Chicken Parm bites were oily and the dipping sauces added nothing to the taste. The best item was the dessert, chocolate toffee jar cake. But please don't waste your hard earned money on this catastrophe."}
{"text":"I might be biased but judging the number of times I dined here, I guess I would have to give this place a review. I used to live the building above the restaurant so I became the first group who ever tried this place. I must say that I was immediately impressed by the fresh pasta and cheese made in store every day. You can verify who made your pasta today on the black board at the entrance. I like this place because it is affordable (around 20 bucks would give you a filling pasta dish) and super tasty. It is more like a chic downtown bar/restaurant that happens to serve you amazing comfort food. I recommend the futtuccine Capri and Pesto pollo; these two are my go-to pasta options. The first one for seafood lover and the second one is chicken. 

Also, do order a large portion, because if you cannot finish, you want to take it home! 

Btw, also lots of wine options and a great place to chill. No reservation needed, big enough for big crowd!"}
{"text":"Love love love Scaddabush. The food is excellent. I have tried the margarita pizza and the Alfredo spaghetti. Always have a great time and great experience. The customer service has always been good. The washroom are generally clean. The interiors are nice. And most of the time you don't need a reservation and can walk in. Would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to eat Italian food. As it tastes good, big portion and great price."}
{"text":"Having been here a few times, this most recent visit confirmed that consistency is difficult to achieve. This time, as a group of six, we visited for lunch. The restaurant was not too busy when we arrived at half past noon, and our waitress was very attentive and ensured that we were consistently well hydrated. 

We ordered a mozzarella board (naked is the only way it is served at lunch), fried zucchini, artichoke dip, and calamari to start. Not surprisingly, the fresh mozzarella was the highlight, this being one of the main reasons that we like to visit. The rest, however, is nothing to write home about.

For mains, three of the flatbreads were ordered, a lobster spaghetti, penne carbonara, and a seafood pasta of some sorts (looked like tagliatelle). Of the three pastas, the tagliatelle had the most consistently cooked noodles, with an even mix of sauce to noodle. Contrarily, the lobster spaghetti was a lacking in this department, with clear, distinctly clumpy sections. In terms of flavour, the coated sections was still acceptable. The flatbread seemed to be generally well received by the table.

Overall, would repeat, although the food quality has noticeably regressed. Service is still sharp, and hopefully this is remains true during the dinnertime rush."}
{"text":"Ate there this week, the music  was far to loud, it was not the right music, the food was cold and not all that impressive.  I would find many of the other fine places to eat in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I only ever come here when a friend wants to look slightly fancy or for a birthday. Not the best place for a student on a budget. We ordered 2 drinks and that was basically $30. $30 and no buzz, and I'm lightweight as hell. Food is alright. For the price I feel like I can eat elsewhere and enjoy it more. Our server was really nice and was always around when we needed him."}
{"text":"Lousiest reception for walk-ins EVER. Rude, unprofessional, unhelpful. Either call ahead and make a reservation (be aware the telephone reservation is equally rude) or avoid. Food is not bad if they actually welcome you"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, came hot. I have been there twice now. Soometimes,  find \" over kill\" on welcoming. Quite costly, if u account for having a few drinks. Having a nice big bottle of water to share is nice while ur waiting. Desserts are limited, but, sweet. We ordered a take out snapper, but, came home & it was a salmon ( more costly).  But, the worst part about the take out for my husband, is they put on salad dressing \" on\" the salad. Which, i do not believe should be done, as when my husband was able it eat it, the salad was a soggy mess in a paper container & it was discarded. Pizza was great. The \" Charity bread\" I find is TOO much butter. My son & I have agreed not to buy it again. 
He ordered the chicken Parmesan. Not consistent with portions from one visit to the next. All in all, it was good"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Scaddabush for a late lunch on the hottest day of the year. Decided to sit at the bar as that's the best place, I find, to get a feel for the restaurant and it's servers. The bartender came over quickly and asked what I'd like to drink. Ordered a soda water and lime and took a look at the menu. 
I decided upon the goat cheese and beet salad with a few mods. No cheese, no nuts, no dressing with a few slices of lemon on the side. To the bartenders credit she didn't even bat an eye. Said no problem and asked if I wanted any protein on it. I said no meat and patiently waited. 
The salad came out relatively quick and was placed in front of me, no cheese, no nuts, no dressing, no lemon wedges. The bartender quickly brought over some lemon and offered me pepper as I picked the shredded Prosciutto off the salad. Minor detail. The salad itself was fresh and exactly what I wanted. Bartender came over two minutes later to see how everything was and I was satisfied. 
Can't really say anything bad about my visit except for the staff complaining about management within ear shot but that seems to happen everywhere. 
I'll be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to scaddabush (the first visit was in another branch)and this time it was disappointing. Pastas were extremely taste-less.
Tiramisu was perfect, soup was too hot even for a person who eats spicyfood, Cesar salad was not bad . Service was very good."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place. Food is subpar- tastes like my mom's cooking, and she's neither Italian nor a great cook lol. 

So it was four of us. We ordered a main of spaghetti and meatballs, a Tuscan salad, a margarita pizza, and dessert if a chocolate toffee jar cake. We were ridiculously underwhelmed, especially by the pizza, which was bland, and the spaghetti and meatballs, which wasn't exceptional. The Tuscan salad was ok. The chocolate toffee jar cake was the biggest waste of money ever. Tasted like box cake. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hosted party for 30+; on a Saturday night.  Everything was on point, staff was very friendly and attentive.  Every9ne enjoyed their time.
Stuffed Cheese Meatballs are awesome!"}
{"text":"At first I was sad they replaced Fazooli's with Scaddabush. I usually went to Fazooli's on Thursdays for the half-price pints.

I eventually caved and decided to give this place a try. The greeters were friendly and showed us to our seats. Although the restaurant has changed, the atmosphere was still the same; loud and lively because of the young adult crowd and the music playing in the background.

I decided to order the Americano Pizza with Charity Bread on the side. I enjoyed the bread very much because of the garlic taste. It was very buttery with a hint of rosemary. Also, the proceeds of ordering the Charity Bread go to a local charity :)

The pizza was splendid! It was freshly baked from the oven. I found the pizza to be very cheesy with a thin crunchy crust! Toppings included pepperoni, mozzarella, tomato sauce, oregano (an Italian herb), and their secret Scaddabush spice.

Overall, the service was good and I liked what I ordered. I can't give this place a higher rating because I haven't tried the rest of their menu yet but I'll definitely be back to try it all."}
{"text":"Really like the food here. Portions are decent, even if you're taking half, and the courses are flavorful and enjoyable.
The one thing left to be desired is the service.
My wife and I ordered one starter to share and two mains. We got one of the mains along with the starter, which is odd but forgivable given we ordered a small starter. The problem was the wait time to get the second dish which we had to wait about 20 minutes for.
So we had two scenarios of one person eating while the other watched, kind of defeats the purpose of eating out with someone..."}
{"text":"Service is great! Staff is really friendly and attentive. The ambiance is wonderful! 

I got the giant meatballs. It was aiight. I expected it to be mind blowing for being one of their signature pieces. 

The mozzarella was a different story. I loved it! They will give you more bread if you ask free of charge. I wanna try all of their different mozzarellas! 

The portions are very generous! I loved the large glass my drink came in! I always hate when i pay and arm and  a leg for a drink and it comes in a dinky small glass. Not here! You will leave this place full and satisfied! I'm looking forward to returning and trying their pastas and pizza! Welcome to my hood Scaddabush! Great to have you ;)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Scaddabush. It was a random place I decided to try out and now it's a fav spot for my girl friend and I. I even had my birthday there in December. My booking was messed up a little but it didn't bother me as their food and drinks are always on point.

Our go to is their mozzarella platters with a pitcher of sangria. Mmmm!

If you haven't, try this place out. There's also one next to Sq one and both locations are convenient for both my girl friend and I."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Scaddabush! 

I came here to celebrate my fiance's birthday and this place is definitely a great group-gathering place. They have nice long tables with comfortable seats (and feet rests!)

Our waitress was just lovely so no complaints there. FYI - For large groups, automatic gratuity is added (and when you make reservations over the phone, they tell you which is much appreciated. No surprises there!)

Now, on to the food. YUM! If you love fresh cheeses, and if you also love Burrata, then please order this here. Great for sharing and there is truffle essence added to the Burrata. My only gripe is that the cheese was not runny inside (like a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg), but the taste more than made up for it. My fiancé and I also shared a \"large\" pasta which was perfect for two. Scaddabush has a lot of sharing plates and sizes so again, perfect for groups.

This place is lively, young, and fun. Noise level is high, but to be expected. Definitely would recommend this place for the great food, service, and ambiance!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Scaddabush was at the MIssissauga location, and had a really good experience. While it was not mind-blowing, for a chain restaurant, it was stellar. I adored their charity bread and the pizza and pastas were enjoyable. But for a family-friendly, large scale chain restaurant, I was a huge fan and excited when they heard they were expanding into Toronto. Fast forward a couple years.... and I have to say I have been disappointed with them several times and today was no different. 

It seems they have changed up the charity bread which I so loved before - either across the entire chain or just at the Toronto location, but it's much smaller, more expensive, and MUCH MORE OILY. 

I've been to them several times due to work lunches and have tried a different pasta each time: the lobster, pesto, arrabiata, bolognese, meatball, etc. It seems like the standard rule is - the more basic you go, the better it tastes. The more ingredients you put in, the more diluted the taste (contrary to logic, I know) and you just get a bowl of heaviness.

The appetizers (or \"sociables\") tend to be the best part of the meal, compared to the more disappointing mains. To note: the bomba burrata (or any of their mozzarella apps), 

Finally, the pinnacle of what made me write a review, aside from its good, but equally mediocre food, was today's event with the manager where my work group went to use up some coupons they had given us over the holidays. It was spend $40 and get $20 off, we read the fine print carefully to make sure we're following the rules and all it said was \"One coupon per bill\". Naturally, we always do separate bills, so we were prepared to eat $40 worth of food each. BUT NO, they wouldn't let us use it because it's one coupon per table. We disputed, but the blonde manager during the lunch hour said \"I know you're going to show me the coupon and point out that it says one coupon per bill, but it's not. It's one coupon per table.\" WELL, I'm sorry if your legal team made a mistake, but you've already publicized it, so please read your own damn fine print, honor it and own up to your mistake, AND don't give me your smug attitude. 

At the end of the lunch, they gave us new discount cards \"Spend $30, get $10 off\", and we asked, is this with the same \"mistake\"? and they responded \"Just read the back\". Okay, it only said \"one coupon per bill\" AGAIN. To which they responded \"Someone needs to fix that at head office\" Well, either head office needs to own up to their mistake, or you're doing something wrong. My last word though, I think had it not been for the awful attitude we received, it would not be such an awful experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times. The food itself is good, but the service made me come back. Good hosts and waiters make for loyal customers.

We had the spaghetti with giant meatballs. The meatballs were not overdone and very filling. The fried garlic was a little too much for me near the end of the meal, but I know others love it. I also tried their burrata as my main the other time. Great decision, it was amazing. Also, their tiramisu is good, but could be more flavourful.

Join their Social club and you'll get $10 off a $30+ bill."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a weekday. I ordered the charity breads (spicy and three cheese), a margarita pizza, Caesar salad, and pesto fettuccini Alfredo. The charity breads were okay a little greasy  from the outside and dry from inside. The margarita pizza was good! The Caesar salad defiantly not amused, super dry lacked lemons and Parmesan. It was like having old dry leafs with very hard crotons. The pesto fettuccini alfredo was terrible!!! The portion size was generous but I would not eat it again. My server was not bad I had to call her a few times. Overall, I would not go back to this place. I would rather just go to Boston pizza for the same time or food and less expensive. Defiantly not a real Italian restaurant !"}
{"text":"new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce and pasta \"everyday\" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as \"charity bread\" was very tasty....apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. 

because it is new....staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn't open...served us a pizza called \"americano\" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we'd order 4 main dish for 3 people)...and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for...by the time we got the cream...coffee was cold. still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of coffee...4oz maybe less. 

we were entertained for a while by the mishaps, but found the overall experience underwhelming. decent ambiance, louder music than I'd like, service can be significantly improved."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went there for the first time and I will come back. 

- Food tasted amazing, lots of flavour 
- Excellent customer service
- Fresh water always in the table
- I think the price is good for what you are getting
- The place is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The meal started off fine, we had an attentive waitress.  One of our friends is anaphylactic to peanut, banana and avocado.  She ordered the Angus burger and told the waitress about her dietary needs.  The waitress assured us that the burger contained none of the allergens and would specifically talk to the kitchen about her allergy.  Then came the food and everything was fine until my friend found a piece of avocado in her burger.  Luckily she didn't eat it, but we were shocked and upset with it.  Especially when we had specifically told them about the allergies. We called our waitress over right away and she was very apologetic about it.  She offered to cover the cost of the burger and asked if my friend would like to order something else.  Honestly at that point, none of us felt like eating anything anymore.  We asked to speak to the manager just to make sure they are aware of the severity of this error.  Our waitress was very helpful and went to look for him immediately.

He came and we told him that we just wanted to let him know about the problem.  He offered his apology and to cover the cost of the burger.  We asked him if he checked with the kitchen to see how could this have happened.  His simply said the kitchen was busy.  Yes, I understand the kitchen was busy but that shouldn't be the excuse.  To us he simply wanted to brush us off and not deal with the real issue. 

Anyway by then my friend started to feel funny and we all decided to leave. The waitress came back to offer dessert on the house, but we didn't want to stay.  Then they came out to give us another burger as a gesture of goodwill...I guess the kitchen felt bad but honestly none of us wanted to take it as we didn't want to be reminded of the burger incident.  However we felt bad in wasting food, so we took it but gave it away.

This is the worst birthday lunch. Not because of the food, not because of the error, mostly the way how the manager handled the situation.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.  

I give one star because the waitress was good."}
{"text":"The meatball is supposed to be a specialty...no Bueno. Not even close to any decent Italian joint.
Beer good though, and service very passable"}
{"text":"Everything was tasty. Mozzarella ball was delicious- get one. Service was friendly and we sat right away. Love the on site Dj. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thought we would try something new, service was excellent, atmosphere excellent, and the food spoke for itself very fresh and flavourful. Would go back overall experience was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to Scaddabush. the atmosphere looked great, it was right downtown, so I said why not? It looks like - what's not to love about pizza and pasta, right?

I went with two girlfriends last night for dinner. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli (zucca?), my friends ordered chicken limone and veal sandwich (which was massive!!). When I received my meal, it was underwhelming. There were maybe 8 pieces of ravioli there for close to $16! That was ridiculous.. $2 a piece. It tasted great, the sage was crisp, but it was way too little for what I paid. I was still hungry after, so my friend offered some of her fries. Seriously? I don't know if I would return.

The service was great, our server was a doll. It was also a birthday for one of my friends, so he brought us a cheesecake on the house, so that was really nice! He wanted to sing for the birthday girl, but she opted out. The table beside us also had a birthday and the same server and he sang... the most beautiful birthday song ever! Wow. He should be a singer. :) haha anyway, I don't know if I would return. 

The place is cute but expensive for what you get! Oh and there is barely any service. I had one bar all night long, so did my friend."}

{"text":"Went here on the weekend. We had been eyeing up this place for sometime.  We had our niece over for a visit and thought this would be a good place to go.

We were taken to a table beside a family that had an ipad in front of their child with a ten second music tune playing on a loop.  Not the restaurants fault, and they found a new place for us right away.

Ordered an appetizer and three meals and three soft drinks.


Soft drinks arrived.  Flat and flavourless.  Advised the waiter.  They went back and gave us a new drinks.  These were heavily carbonated and sugary, but literally flavorless for a Sprite. 

Our meals arrived - waiter forgot about our appetizer 'Sometimes I can't read my own writing,' was his response.

My niece and wife ordered fresh made pasta.  My niece ordered pollo pesto.  The pasta wasn't good and was pretty much covered in only garlic.

My wife ordered Spaghetti and meatball (singular).  The pasta was a little too firm and the sauce was far too sugary.

Myself, I ordered the meatball sandwich.  From the description it didn't say anything about green or red peppers, but there were a lot on the sandwich when it arrived.  And that flavour rapidly permeated everything.  And since it isn't a flavour I like I was only able to eat about 1/3 of the sandwich, which was very bready.

Overall, all 3 of us were disappointed with our meals.  Everything was fairly bland and flavourless.  None of us ate more than half our meal.  They ended up taking my sandwich off the bill, but not the soft drinks.  So the price of two pasta dishes and 3 soft drinks ended up at $55

Presentation of the food: I have to say all the food arrived looking very good.  However, I'm there more for the taste and quality of the food.

Overall - first and last visit here."}
{"text":"We just arrived to the city after 14 hours in the plane, we were exhausted and really hungry!
But, our standards are really high when it comes to food.
So, we asked for recommendations and here we were, Italian restaurant and having lunch at 5pm!!
Waiters were friendly and food was good.
I would recommend you to go, if you are in the city for more than 2 days.
If not, I would say I have better options!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place for some great pasta, meatball and wine!!! They have some \"patio\"seating right outside their restaurant but I wouldn't suggest it because you get pedestrians walking by you on one side and dust and pollution from cars on the other side (streets). The inside is worth sitting at even if it's nice and sunny out because their interior designs are nice and if you have a big group, youe table becomes candle light dinners.

They make their own baseball size really good meatballs which comes classic or stuffed for about $13 to $14. Its really good and definitely a must try. They hand pull their mozzarella and make their own pasta Italian style. Their pasta comes in gluten free and whole wheat upon request. Their pasta is really good though. Better than the spaghetti factory.

\"Social\" is basically appetizer or for sharing portions. A small was good enough for my meal for the pasta but they also come in large and social.

They have a good wine list and a section of it called generous wine is basically Italian or Niagara table wine which comes in half litre or one liter size for $16-20.

Their bar side  closes around 2 am so you can always comr for a few drinks after work. They are affiliated with SIR Corp. Oh if you sign up with their Social Club you get $10 off from your next purchase of $30!"}
{"text":"I didn't find this restaurant to be particularly amazing. That being said, if you do come here get the burata mozzarella and the stuffed meatball. The meatball is delicious. 

I had the chicken parm which had a side of pasta. Unfortunately, I had to send the pasta back to the kitchen since it wasn't cooked through enough- was extremely hard and tasted awful. Chicken parm was good but nothing to brag about. 

The servers were very attentive and the customer service was great- the restaurant manager greeted us as well and immediately took care of my undercooked pasta situation and took it off my bill. 

I think this restaurant will do well mainly due to its amazing location and their authentic mozzarella & meatballs."}
{"text":"Strike three, you're out. Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to scaddabush opening up in Scarborough. 
1. We ordered a bottle of wine. Came after our appetizers and get this.... After our mains. Ridiculous right? 
2. I specifically asked for stuffed meatball on some spaghetti. Waitress even asked if I wanted extra meat sauce for my spaghetti. She brings only the meatball (no spaghetti).
3. Probably the worst of them all. Friend ordered a pasta dish and they got it all wrong. Instead of bringing back a completely new and the correct dish, they brought back the original dish just touched up. Really gross. The manager had the audacity to lie and say she was back there and that didn't happen. But I'm a yelper, I take pictures of my food before I eat it. Showed her a pic of the original dish and she continued to defend.

Really unfortunate because all the dishes we got (bumba burrata, stuffed meatball, avocado and goat cheese bruschetta) were really yummy. If only the service could be at par."}
{"text":"My dining experience occurred at the Scaddabush - Scarborough location.  I was served by Shakura on March 8th for dinner.
Shakura was not very pleasant while serving my girlfriends and I.  She did not smile, did not make eye contact and rushed taking down our orders.
When we had finished dinner, I had asked to order a small lobster spaghetti to go.  As she picked up our dishes, she did not ask if we wanted our calamari (which was still quite full) in a to go bag.  I stopped her and asked to have the leftover calamari to go and add it to my lobster spaghetti, she acknowledged my request.  As she handed out our bills, she brought out a bag with my meals. 

When I arrived back home, i noticed I did not have the calamari as I originally requested.  The calamari was still a full dish which was pretty much wasted as Shakura did not fulfill my request as to take it home.  I basically lost my $14.00 (overpriced) calamari.

Shakura should take her time with her customers and listen carefully! I don't know if she forgot my request or just didn't hear me originally."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: They literally just opened about 5 days ago at the time of this post so it's obvious there are going to be some kinks. 

2.5 stars + .5 for service. 

Really nice people but everything took forever. Coffee 10 minutes, food over 30 minutes, dessert another 10, bill another 15. 

We ordered the Snapper ($20.95), Osso Bucco Bites ($12.75 or something), and the Carbonara ($16.85 or something), along with a Tiramisu (about $8.25) for dessert. 

Snapper
Dry overcooked fish with little flavour paired with tasteless potatoes and tasteless beans. 

Osso Bucco Bites
Actually ok. Crispy outer layer, meat was still moist, nice and flavourful, the crisps were a nice touch too. Maybe a bit small. 

Carbonara
Penne Carbonara? There were probably about 2 strips of bacon cut up smaller with some green onion and a small egg. To be fair that's probably all they could fit in their small dish. 

Tiramisu
Actually pretty good! Nice and creamy, good coffee flavour, moist cake... probably the highlight of our 1.5 hour ordeal. :) 

They've got a lot to work on but I really hope they get better. Lots of competition in the area and I'd love a great Italian place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Usually good food. Usually HORRIBLE service.
I've been in here a few times over the years and the food has always been tasty.........if you can get someone to acknowledge that you are even in the restaurant.  Then, if they happen to take your order, set your sun dial or go paint a room cause you'll have all the time in the world.  Seriously, I sat at the bar with 2 other people there.  It took 5 minutes before I finally gave in and asked for a drink because the 4 people in and around the bar were doing anything and everything to not say hi and take my order.  I ordered a beer, a salad, and some bread.  IT TOOK 25 minutes or more! WTF?  I've noticed that service in Canadian restaurants is way lacking compared to the U.S. but this place takes shitty service to a whole new level."}
{"text":"I love this place more than anyone should love a restaurant... Any time someone wants to go for dinner this is my suggestion - this could also be because my boyfriend now refuses to go here with me, not because the food is bad but because we have been here so often.

I order too much every single time I come (it's hard to make up my mind as they offer so many of my favorite foods), but it's okay because they will always wrap up my leftovers and they're just as good to eat the next day.

My advice: try the charity bread and the fresh mozzarella! I cannot stress this enough. Both are SO GOOD! 

I've never had a problem getting a table, and the wait staff has always been friendly and attentive (without being obnoxious). 

In my opinion the music is a little too loud, but don't let that stop you from coming here! The food will make up for it."}
{"text":"You must try the meatballs and the mozzarella!

Delicious. Great service. We were seated right away on Friday night."}
{"text":"came here a few times and have always had to wait for a seat, for a chain restaurant it's not bad.

now if you're looking for authentic Italian cuisine don't come here but if you're looking to catch a fix for your craving then go ahead.

my favourite thing on their menu is the fresh cheese it will always be my go to app!

for mains we had two different types of pasta that you can tell is fresh.

I had the ravioli which I really enjoyed and my girlfriend had the chicken pesto. 

for dessert we had the apple pie- it was good.

The restaurant is decent for a chain but I still would rather a mom & pop shop."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends to catch up over some food and wine. We usually go to Jack Astor's, but upon arrival decided to try Scaddabush instead for something different. It was a weekday evening and wasn't too busy, but the service we received was terrible. 

We decided to share the Garlic Charity Bread which donates proceeds to a local charity, and the Fresh Mozzarella with Prosciutto. The bread was good, but the mozzarella was the star of the evening. I ordered the Straight Up Meatball, but thought it was way too rich for my taste. One friend ordered the Zucca Ravioli and the other one ordered a Margherita pizza. The butternut squash pasta was really good and the pizza was nothing special. 

Overall, I don't think I will be back any time soon for my own taste. I expected more from this place."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (60% of final grade)
The pasta portions are just right, but if you are REALLY hungry, I recommend getting one of their pizzas-- it comes on a very nice serving block with its own pair of scissors so that you can cut your pizza! Scaddabush also has their in-house special mozzarella. I tried it and it was a solid 3/5-- nothing too fancy, but it was cool to have a clementine-sized ball of mozzarella with other pairings with it. I especially recommend the roasted fennel and sausage fettuccine! Their meatballs are fist-sized, but not totally delectable or anything. I don't find myself craving their food, but their food is pretty instagram-able in presentation.

Ambiance 4/5 (10% of final grade)
Loud enough to be comfortable, but not blaring over conversations. Scaddabush has an amazing ambiance with it! It's a very chic-yet-classic, dimly-lit, Italian restaurant not intended for a casual family dinner. I imagine people going to Scaddabush for a girl's night out, intimate parties, holiday dinners, or dates. There's a cineplex right within walkable distance inside a mall, so it's pretty ideal for a casual date.

Service 4/5 (10% of final grade)
The servers are not only fashionable, but amiable as well! They always keep the water re-filled, if not promptly refilled upon request for more. Naturally, if you go in smaller groups you'll get more attentive service, but they always seem to care enough to ask genuinely how you thought the food was. When I got a lemon sorbet that was a tad sour for me, she even offered to switch it to the raspberry one instead. While I didn't take her up on her offer, it was still incredibly thoughtful of her to do so. 

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
I seem to spend a pretty penny every time I go, but that might be because I order too much just to try everything. If you are looking for an entree only, budget around $25 per person. If you are looking for more, $60 per person would be very realistic. For the quality of the experience, I think that the price is fair. Not a place for comfort food though, but a place to dress just a little bit fancier for. 

Brownie Points 4/5 (10% of final grade)
For the service, yes, but mostly for the fact that this is the only place I would really go to for a girl's night out in the area. There simply aren't that many places within a few kilometres that can provide the experience Scaddabush does. 

Final Grade = 71/100 = 4 Stars

TLDR: Come here for mostly the ambiance and that one dish you'll fall in love with. Heck, the ambiance is nice enough that you might fall in love (again?) with the person you're dining with.

Don't go alone though, that's lonely."}
{"text":"The food was ok, not great, and all dishes are lukewarm.  
Agree with the comment above, would not pay $21+ for a pasta that has mini and not-too-fresh scallop and shrimps again."}
{"text":"First time at scaddabush. The food was amazing. I had the bolognese with fettucine pasta and the bacon and egg pizza. The food tasted of very high quality and expertly crafted. The service was also great and food arrived promptly. Although the table I was given was a tad bit small and rather uncomfortable, this was an extremely minor setback in my experience. I feel like my life has been changed for the better. I will definitely be visiting again very shortly."}
{"text":"This place is one of my restaurants in the area and any time I hang out with friends, it's my restaurant of choice!  

It draws a younger crowd which I prefer (20s- 35s) and it's an overall fun, light-hearted place to hang out. 

The food is very creative and it's always a twist or creative take on something pretty classic which adds some excitement to the dish you're ordering. 
I always get the BLT and it's probably the best BLT I've ever add because it's not done in such a typical way. 

Overall a fun place and id recommend it"}
{"text":"Really good pasta! I really like it. Came for the pasta and left satisfied. I also like the mango peach Bellini. That's my fav cocktail and they've made it great:) I'm really happy with the food and the service there. The waitress is very friendly and approachable."}
{"text":"Firstly, the atmosphere walking in was actually spectacular, and invigorating. The first thing you see is the in-house DJ up by the front, and if you went in on a busy night like me, the excited social, buzzing tables you pass by make it feel and look like a shot out of a movie. The interior is interesting, and as the name of the restaurant, Scaddabush, would suggest, it is a little bit of everything. Each table is set up with a stack of wet, dewey, assorted dishes, and rolls of forks and knives. The menus were on disposable, one-time use paper, and the price ranges were from ~8-20 dollars, with the average being about maybe 12 dollars? 

After the initial, friendly greeting from your servers, though, the food we received and questionable service made everything a bit uncomfortable. When we asked to be reseated to a nearby table, a server bringing our (delicious) bruschetta was more than happy to oblige. However, when our main server arrived, he looked at my friend (who is insecure about her weight) and asked her \"Was the table too small for you?\". This was obviously offensive to her and me, and us being too stunned to say anything, he was quick to be on his way again.

After a long wait, the main dish he brought later for me was a Berkshire (?) Sausage Pasta, which had cold, undercooked noodles, watery drippings pooled at the bottom, with admittedly delicious, hot bits of meat. Honestly, after eating about a fourth of it I got pretty nauseous, and cold tap water we were served didn't really help. Before I started eating, I prayed, which I earned a long hard stare for from our server. He was so distracted, in fact, for the duration of my praying, that he wasn't able to serve the cheese he had offered to my friends until he was snapped out of it when my friend explained I was praying.

He was friendly enough after we ate, besides these slip-ups, and after a bit of chatting, I politely let him know that the pasta was maybe sub-par, and why. He was surprised to hear it, and let me know that if I had mentioned it he certainly would of had it redone, so that was nice. Also, the gelato (both vanilla and chocolate) was delicious!

Overall though, the few offensive slip-ups (maybe he was inexperienced?), the food that got me sick for the rest of the night, and a few details (like the wet dishes, and nearby broken glass light decorations hanging overhead neighbouring tables) was enough to put me off. People make mistakes, and our servers were nice since we were polite, but the cumulative experience was unpleasant overall. 

So: 2/5, but hopefully if we go again I won't get sick again."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least.  First off why are we
told that since we don't have a reservation it will be a 10-20 minute wait and then when we're finally seated the restaurant is half full.  Some of the food is passable but seriously...SEASON YOUR FOOD!  Even adding pepper  and salt couldn't hide the lack of flavour in the dishes. Service is friendly and efficient...that was the saving grace...however not enough to warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for valentine's day . The servers were friendly and consistent. I got the pesto fettucine thing and it was pretty good however i was disappointed by the veggies and pasta ratio because there was a lot of pasta but like a small handful of tomatoes and spinach to go with it. The prosciutto mozerella is very good for an entree, the cheese was a little hard to cut and i dont think we divided the prosciutto evenly so we didnt have enough BUT its really good make sure to put everything on it (like the jam and the sea salt on the sides)."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't empty but it wasn't too busy. I got the zucca ravioli and I really enjoyed it. I also got a mango peach Bellini and it was so good.  We had such a cool server, his name was Tristan he was great, really friendly. My food came promptly and was good for the price. I would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I love me some spaghetti and meatballs so I was excited to try this place.  Pasta is made in-house and the mozzarella is made fresh everyday (only available after 5pm).  

The first time I came, my friend and I ordered the social spaghetti and stuffed meatball since the server said it was a good for 2 people.  It comes with only 2 meatballs but they are huge and the amount of pasta can feed up to 4.  I thought the spaghetti sauce was simple and I've had better meatballs from other restaurants.  The services was great - fast and friendly.

The second time I came for lunch. The caesar salad had way too much dressing and it seemed like I was eating caesar with a side of salad.  The Italian wedding soup is not what I expected.  I am no expert in Italian cuisine but I thought it was more of a minestrone.  The Parmesan bites were yummy and I would order them again.  The pizza was the saviour to this meal.  Crunchy crust and fresh ingredients on top.  The service in the bar wasn't as good as the dining room.  It's a good thing I checked the bill because she charged us for full price items that were supposed to be discounted as part of the pizza & soup/salad deal.

This place is nothing to gush about.  If I ever eat here again, it won't be because I recommended it."}
{"text":"If you want reliable tasty Italian food, look no further. Every time I come here, every dish is excellent and feels very authentic. It could be the decor or the over-the-top wait staff but I've happy to report I've never had a bad experience.

At my latest visit I tried the grilled cheese and prosciutto. Seems silly right? Who orders a grill cheese at an Italian restaurant? Naysayers be warned, stretchy cheese and a hint of fig jam made a party on my palate. Paired with a stuffed meatball, I had a full meal that I finished with a strawberry cream tartufo. 

Great meal, giving me high hopes on my next visit."}
{"text":"Being a pasta lover, I was ecstatic to eat here. Started off with the Charity Bread ($2). It was delicious! I was expecting a lot less for two bucks. Having the proceeds go to a local charity was a bonus. 

Berkshire Sausage (L $16.24):
All of the sausage was finely minced. I was expecting thinly cut sausage, but I still kept high hopes. At first bite I could tell the pasta was undercooked and bland. Big no for me. A bit of cheese helped. 

My friend had the Pesto Pollo (L $16.77): 
I preferred the Pesto Pollo over the Berkshire Sausage. Still both were undercooked.
 
I know this place recently opened, but undercooked pasta? The garlic bread was better. The stuffed meatball leaves me curious, but I'm not sure if that is enough to have me quickly returning.

* old review I had written that was recently posted (2015)"}
{"text":"This place is really not that good...overpriced menu for bland food.
I got the seafood pasta, which arrived and looked like straight up linguine with no toppings. Did all my seafood swim away somewhere? Where'd they go? So I thought that maybe the sauce would make up for it. Nuh uh. The pasta was as tasteless as it could be, I was just eating boiled pasta. Never ordering that again. Maybe the kitchen staff forgot several ingredients in that dish.

We also got an appetizer, bread or fries, I really cannot remember because it just wasn't memorable.

On the upside, my friends do love their fresh mozzarella balls though, so maybe that'd be worth a try. They also serve pizzas with those cool standing scissors. 

My friend tried to make a group reservation the other day and called Scaddabush. The staff said they had plenty of room. She calls again after half an hour confirming a number of 20 and suddenly the restaurant is completely booked up."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. 
We came here as a family on vacation and picked the restaurant for the fun of watching them making the mozzarella. When observing the mozzarella art we were offered a sample. 
The food was amazing like in Italy, totally family style. I love the idea of 'social ' plates. The servers were exclusively courteous.

One of the best meals we had in a very long time. Absolutely amazing. 

There is simply nothing to improve!"}
{"text":"Call me snobby but this is miles away from my definition of Italian food. Service is fine and portions are huge. Shared some calamari to start and that didn't go well with our stomachs."}
{"text":"Food excellent, service great, portion size meh. Could have been a rabbit bigger but overall great experience"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had some decent pasta. Scaddabush hits the spot. Upon walking into the restaurant, the host is very courteous, greets me and takes me up to my reserved seat. Less than 30 seconds after I sat down, the server swung by and served me water right away and provided the menu. I decided on the crispy polenta fries and small napoli, and these were definitely a decent choice. The crunch the garlic bits had added exquisite texture to the napoli pasta; there was plenty of seafood and roasted grape tomatoes. The salsa verde gave the pasta a Mexican edge. The portions were generous and prices were reasonable for the quality of food--I was stuffed to the brim with a small pasta dish for $14.98. The server was very prompt and visited our table often to check on us--excellent service. 

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for a good place to catch up with friends and simultaneously indulge in the food from this well-seasoned restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here during Winterlicious and found by the food pretty good and was impressed with the service.

Highlights of the meal include the avocado + goat cheese bruschetta and their Chicken Limone. We were not impressed by the fresh mozzarella. The calamari and tiramisu was just okay and I've definitely had better.

The service was excellent and attentive. Within a minute of sitting down we were already brought over water.

The decor was well done and very similar to Red's right beside it. 

Overall it's a nice chain restaurant to visit for dinner but just be careful of what you order."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since it's in the neighbourhood. My favourite thing on the menu is definitely the tomato parmesan soup!! It's amazing and delish. I've also tried the Sophia and diavolo pizzas, which are okay, definitely need some chili flakes on top. I most recently tried the roasted fennel and sausage fettuccine which I found to be just okay. The cream sauce was great but that's about it."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! We had a variety of menu items, include appitizers (socialables), sandwich and pasta. Service was appropriate, the atmosphere was awesome and the food was one of the best Italian feasts I've ever had. I would definitely go back and I would recommend for sure !"}
{"text":"When jackastors has a long wait list on weekends, we usually go here instead. Although lately I am beginning to prefer this place over jack Astor's if I am planning on eating something versus just having drinks. The giant home made meatball dishes are a great pick, as are their pizzas. The lattes need some work. The only real annoyance is that the music is generally too loud, making conversation a chore because you cannot hear the others at the table. Overall, this place an a good refresh from its previois alias of Alice fazoolies, especially in terms of what is on the menu."}
{"text":"Very very good food. Everything was wonderful, had the three cheese charity bread and the butcher pizza, and then the penne with meat sauce . Everything was very good and very authentic flavours. The only thing was we were there around 9 pm and the leafs game 6 was on and service was extremely slow even though it wasn't busy. Service could be improved. We sat right next to the bar and it still took ten minutes to order a beer for some reason.... food was great, but service, chit times and drink ticket times NEED improvement."}
{"text":"Grat atmosphere, great food and ok prices.

We went there on Friday, me and 3 of my friends really liked it.
The cheese they make is awesome! We will go back again.
Highly recommended for big events as well. They have big tables can accommodate parties."}
{"text":"We found SCADDABUSH to be a large trendy restaurant with a cozy atmosphere. The employees were nothing but smiling, friendly, and provided great service! The food is traditional Italian and got something for everyone, they produce their own mozarella and pasta, and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Visited here twice. Once on a lunch run and second time for a dinner with friends. I really. The first visit I ordered and shared one of the pizzas (forgot which one but it had porschiutto) and the bolognese with lemon ricotta. The pizza was ok, but nothing to write home about. It is a hefty portion though so definitely can be shared with a friend for a light lunch. The bolognese though was the highlight in my mind. I thought the lemon ricotta complemented the bolognese really well and offset the heavy/greasy feeling one often gets from eating a bolognese. 

Since I enjoyed my lunch, I returned for dinner and ordered a stuffed meatball and spaghetti and ate off some of my friend's fresh mozarella which I am told is made in house. The mozarella was fantastic in my limited cheese knowledge, because I can actually taste the strong flavour of the milk that the cheese was made from. That plus toast and the tomato jelly was a great combo. 

The stuffed meatball and spaghetti was ok. The meatball on it's own was great, but I think their bolognese just set a really high standard for me in terms of the pasta. It was probably the ricotta that made the difference for me. My friend also got a chicken parm. It was pretty ordinary, I recommend sticking to their specialties (ie. pasta + pizza) instead.

Price wise, standard downtown price. For those on a student budget may be save up to reward yourself after exam seasons. Or come during winter/summerlicious."}
{"text":"I've come here a fair amount of times with colleagues since I work at a hospital just down the street. Honestly, if you're looking for authentic Italian food, go to Terroni, Stelvio, or the handful of other Italian restaurants downtown. Yet, I still keep coming back to Scaddabush because it's a great time and place to get lost in hourlong conversations. The atmosphere is not very upscale and most of the servers are pretty accommodating. I like to get the chicken pesto linguine without chicken (they take $2 off my dish when I do this), and the small size is enough for me. 

What keeps bringing me back to Scaddabush though is their red sangria. I don't know what it is about this place, but they know how to make the perfect red sangria. So many of my favorite evenings have involved sipping away on their delicious sangria, which doesn't taste watered down at all. It's pretty strong, so if you don't like the taste of red wine go for the white! 

The first time I came here the avocado tomato bruschetta was on point, but in subsequent times it's been quite soggy and disappointing. If the food were consistent every time I'd give this place 4 stars just because it's a fun place to unwind at the end of a long week."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time during Summerlicious and was pretty disappointed. I had the caprese salad, penne sausage ragu and tiramisu - all of which was decent but lacking in flavour overall.

I decided to try it out one more time for regular lunch with a friend. I had the Capri pasta - it tasted pretty good and had more flavour, but was unjustly lacking in the seafood department (1 piece of scallop in the entire plate lol). What really took the cake was my friend's plate of Pesto Pollo pasta. Fantastic pesto flavour paired with decent portions of well cooked chicken. We were in agreement that if we go there again, we'll both be getting the pesto pasta."}
{"text":"Went to this place recently as I heard their food is good. The one thing I have to recommend is the fresh mozzarella that's available from 5 pm I believe. I tried the naked mozzarella as an appetizer and it was so fresh and tasty-definitely something to share. The presentation was very rustic and I would go back just for that. Entrees were underwhelming but the waiter was funny. Overall it was a bit pricey for what you get and I don't think I would go back because of that."}
{"text":"Fresh mozzarella was really good.... Have ordered a pasta and pizza in the past and remembered liking the magherita, while the pasta was blah.


\"Then last time we were there, they burnt our pizza and still insisted we should take it or may take a while behind all the other orders. Didn't appreciate that and dinner was totally ruined (so overdone that it was black all around  and at the bottom) They tried to shut us up with a free dessert which wasn't that great either (donuts?). We filled up on the bread and left pretty unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto alone, I wanted to enjoy good food in my hotel room. I ordered the Zucca ravioli and was pleasantly surprised. The hazelnut cream was lovely with the crispy basil leaves. The ravioli was super tasty, with a good dose of root veggies my stomach is full and I'm very happy. Service for take out was quick and friendly. I'll return, maybe sit down to enjoy the atmosphere and bring a friend."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere, I loved the band with an amazing music.
I liked the appetizers presentation and quality of material used in the food with an excellent service."}
{"text":"Firm 3.5 stars

I have eaten at a lot of large scale restaurants and this one is not that bad in terms of service and food. This is my second time here: If you had to ask me what I thought about my first visit I would say that both the food and service was excellent but they played extremely loud music which made it difficult to hear my conversation within our group. After all, it was the weekend so I guess they needed to make the party happening.

Walking in, the setup and scale is very grand. High brick pillars supporting high ceilings, plenty of tables to seat small and large groups, and a huge oval bar lined with televisions just above. Seats and tables everywhere. The bench seating by the windows do feel a little crammed when you make your way in so the table might feel like it's pressing against your chest. 

The food: Love it. Carbs heaven. This time around we ordered:
Fettuccine Capri (Regular $21.77): Large size, tons of seafood, will order again.
Baked Penne Carbonara ($17.49): Baked in a small cast iron pan. Full of flavour and cream. Although the amount is small, it is heavy and rich enough to fill you up.
Margherita Pizza ($15.27): Pretty good size of 8 slices. San Marzano tomato sauce makes the taste. They sort of burnt the first pizza and had to redo it. Second pizza was burnt slightly less but we just simply cut that piece out from the crust.

The service: We arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant was open so we had to wait for a short time to be seated. Madison was our server and she accommodated our every need. When we complained about our first pizza being burnt, she went straight back to the kitchen and reordered a 2nd pizza for us. When she saw that we cut out a big chunk of burnt crust from the 2nd pizza, she was very generous to take the entire pizza off the bill. Now THAT is how you take care of your customers.

Overall, Scaddabush meets my approval. I would recommend eating here during a weekday lunch unless you don't mind the noise level during happy hour.

{"text":"The ambience at this place is food. The waiters are a lil pushy in the sense they will keep hovering on you unroll you get nervous and order something and once you have paid your bill they kind of expect you to leave fast. I tries Arabiata penne and it was good flavor wise but a lil dry ie lacking the sauce."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy. Don't avoid it just because it's a chain and always ALWAYS get the charity bread."}
{"text":"Wow. All I have to say is wow. Came here for an event and thy were above and beyond. Delicious food, amazing service.  Great location. Definitely come here."}
{"text":"This place is a 3.5 for me, it has kinks to work out (still, since my last review three years ago) and it seems from other reviews over that time that they are inconsistent.  I was \"lucky\" enough to go here two nights in a row last week, so I got a real true comparison of experiences - one night was a 4 star night, the other a 2 star night.

The food is good.  Really good.  Especially considering it could be bad, because they'd probably still be busy.  Drinks are good.  Menu has lots to pick from.  Hostesses both nights were friendly.

The problem the second night was that our entrees took 45 minutes to come out - to the point that I had to complain, and they checked on the ticket and I hadn't been exaggerating, it had been way too long.  They told me they'd comp a dessert for us, but that is not the right response when the complaint is \"this is taking too long\" - the last thing you want is to be in the restaurant EVEN LONGER.  I let them know this was not the response I wanted, and they ended up comping our entrees, which WAS the correct action and a good Quality Service Adjustment.  

What I didn't like is that it still took them forever to bring the bill, even after they knew we were in a rush, and when she finally brought the bill, the server said to me, \"Just so you know, that wasn't my fault, I know you're mad at me, but it's not my fault.\"  Which is totally awkward, and for all she knew I hadn't told anyone else at the table I was upset, but also, who is she throwing under the bus? The kitchen? It was especially uncouth to declare this as she's standing there waiting for us to tip her - which we did, and quite nicely, because we are industry.  I would never want one of my servers to actually say out loud \"it wasn't my fault\".  You are the face of every aspect of the restaurant, sadly, even if a customer walks away thinking it was your fault, that's just the name of the game.  You win big and lose big.

Would go back but they need to iron out details, especially considering how many staff were working!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. All staff were great! Love the tables in the bar area. Ordered drinks and apps. Beer selection was the usual suspects, no craft. We got the spinach dip and calamari and they were pretty good! Spinach dip wasn't heavy like I've had everywhere else, it was whipped and fluffy. 

Reservations recommended, it was packed! Lots of free parking!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. 

Didn't get complete order 

Ignored by staff all night 

When we spoke to manager, she made excuses for the bad service 

We didn't pay for the one drink but someone could have apologized for not being attentive and then being rude. 

Too bad. Never going back."}
{"text":"I came here for a work lunch and thought it was a pretty nice place. Lots of options to choose from, ambience is similar to a milestones or Jack Astor's. Don't expect amazing food. I got the meatball sandwich with rosemary fries and I liked my meal, but I wouldn't pay $20 for it. The focaccia bread was very nice and the meatball was tasty. I also really liked the fries."}
{"text":"Good, not as good as I thought though.

A friend and I got together here a few weeks ago and ordered a pizza and entree dish. He loved his chicken entree with cream sauce. My pizza was also quite good, with a nice balsamic glaze but it left something to be desired. Could be the caramelized onions weren't as present as I thought they would be or that there was only a drizzle of balsamic which made it seem more like bread with a bit of cheese and chicken. In any case 3/5 for the food!

The service was super friendly so extra points for that and the decor was cool. Would like to try some of their cocktails next time because they did sound great."}
{"text":"Social atmosphere and vibe is great, food was decent...It's too bad the service wasn't all too good--came on a busy Sat night, so it's understandable we had to wait 20 or so min to be seated. But our order (which we put in almost immediately because we were so hungry!) took a whole 40min to arrive.

First came the appetizers: avocado and goat cheese bruschetta, which was good except the bread was a little soft (soggy) for it to taste like bruschetta; tuscan salad, which was kind of overdressed; caprese salad, which was the best of the apps. Mozzarella was delicious, i was happy about that.

Then, while in the middle of eating our apps, maybe 5 min in, the waiters come with all our mains. Quite abrupt and not the best timing--my guess is that our apps were probably waiting in the kitchen for a while, and now everything was just being pushed out all of a sudden. 

The spaghetti and (giant) meatball was mediocre, not quite worth the $18 price. The chicken/shrimp pasta and bolognese were better value. The lobster spaghetti was pretty good.

Overall, wouldn't exactly say the food was anything amazing, and the service didn't help either... But still an ok place for social group hangouts."}
{"text":"The quality of service has gone down significantly since my previous visits. We went there on a Saturday night around 10. It wasn't busy and we were easily seated. Our waitress was super awkward, almost like she didn't know how interact with customers. About 30 mins after she took our order, she came back to tell us that sausages are done and our order had to be changed. She forgot to bring us our forks even though our appetizers came out. She barely came by to check on us, and no other waitresses were around so we couldn't get a refill of water. By the time our waitress returned, we were done our food and ready to get out. 
 
The food was okay, but it wasnt able to make up for the terrible service. I used to love their bomba cheese, but this time it was stiff."}
{"text":"Took an hour for food to be prepared.  Noodles were not cooked and tasted sticky.  when we asked for the pasta to be cooked they must have thrown water on the dish and stir fried it because the dish came back soggy and bland.  ruined the evening."}
{"text":"The place is nice and it clearly services the businesses in the area - weekday lunches are almost always filled with large tables of teams celebrating something or other. The menus are great, and the food is pretty and delicious. Staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is much nicer than the JA's next door (even though they do share a location, I know they're the same parent company).

The portions were good, and the price point is perfect. I would certainly come back here for another lunch, and I like that there's a new option in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of the place.., my coworkers and I went there about 2 weeks ago and we love their pasta and pizza... the only turns us off it took them awhile to bring out the food... but its worth it...!"}
{"text":"Yummy food - I've had mostly appetizers. The fresh mozzarella is like crack it's so good. Try the bare one. Service is just ok though. It seems to take forever to get drinks or have your order taken... Even when it's not too busy. I do t get it there are servers everywhere but service is slow. 

Also music is too loud and its a bit to dark."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is lovely! I went here a couple months ago for my birthday, the place wasn't packed because it was in the middle of the day, which was good because our waiter paid a lot of attention to us! The food was amazing. The pizza was absolutely delicious I can still remember how amazing it tasted. The wine selection was good too. The waiter even gave us some birthday shots! yay!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick meet up with old co-workers. It' s really great atmosphere.I loved the service of the staff, the interior was really spacious but has a warm, cozy feeling.  I didnt eat much so I definitely have to go back. Had some wine , charity bread and  amazing apple pie. I will definitely be back in the spring to eat real food off the menu can't wait."}
{"text":"Steak was the worst! Felt like it was taken out of the cold room and slapped on the grill, it had no seasoning or any juiciness to it. Had to ask for BBQ sauce to make it edible. Also had the pizza, was so bad i didn't bother taking a picture. Stick to their pasta and you will get away with a decent meal."}
{"text":"Service
The restaurant is usually quite busy but for a Monday night it was okay. Our waitress was quite friendly and asked us how we were doing throughout the night. No flaws in my perspective.

Restaurant
I just really don't like high chairs. I'm already short so I do not appreciate having my legs dangling in the air lols. Anyhow, the major issue is that I cannot adjust my chair as easily - they do however kind of swivel. The place is dimly lighted but certain areas are brighter which makes food selfies a little easier. They have plenty of plates in the middle because it's a restaurant where large groups can come to share appetizers. For those who don't know, the restaurant is a bit hidden - right beside Reds Tavern. If you have problems finding it, don't hesitate to give them a call. On a busy night, you can expect to wait at least 1 hour (but there is a Starbucks right across). The only thing I really disliked was the bathroom's location. Why is it upstairs? Anyhow it's a minor issue.

Food 
HOW CAN I BE PAYING THIS PRICE FOR SUCH GOOD FOOD? Hands down, this is not what you expect. First of all, the prices are quite fair based on their quality and portions. We ordered 2 appetizers and a main - fully stuffed, and my boyfriend had to do take-out bag lols. The pizza is super big and everyone becomes wow'ed by their special scissors. The crust is not thin but the content is fabulous! Anyhow you cannot go wrong and trust me, two cannot finish this monster. We move on to the charity bread which is at an all low of $3-4. Basically if you have heard of blooming bread - this is the baby version. Filled with scrumptious amounts of garlic and probably butter, you are eating a very tasty piece of bread lols. We move on to the second appetizer which is the spinach and artichoke dip priced at $12 ish. I effing love crostini so when they paired this with the dip - heaven help me lols. The dip is given in a generous amount and yum, warm! Needless to say, we were impressed! As for the drinks we ordered, beer is beer lol but my caesar tasted a bit different. First of all they give you a surprise snack at the top but this drink is mixed with horse radish - neat? It actually tasted more like oyster than a classic caesar drink but still not bad. I think the best caesar I had was in a Yelp tasting event and at a wedding."}
{"text":"I went for an event and my experience was great. I had easy access to a server so if I needed anything, I didn't have to wait long. The service was quick, efficient and everyone was very friendly. I ended up ordering the marghuritta for apetizers and chicken Alfredo for my main. Unfortunately the chicken to be quite dry. I believe it was because it was deep fried. I also got the deep fried dough with Nutella sauce which was just alright. Other than that, food was great and flavourful. I particularly enjoyed the wine selection and suggestions. I had to try 4 different types but my favourite was definitely Valpolicella Ripasso DOC :) I will definitely return when I am in the area :)"}
{"text":"My bf and I used to eat here regularly because Mississauga doesn't have very many options for good late night eats. We really enjoyed the food but over time, the service began to slack. Numerous times, it took the waiter at least 20mins to half an hour to approach our table. We were very patient at first because it's understandable when it's busy but even when we come for a slow lunch the service is lacking. We began to order take out instead. We finally stopped coming here when the hostess forgot to punch in our takeout order. We'd call in our order and arrive at Scaddabush only to find out nothing was made. This happened not only once but TWICE! Three stars because the food is still good but regardless of how good the food is, bad customer service draws the line for me. We won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"I came to Scaddabush (formerly known as Alice Fazoolis) on their grand opening day. The restaurant looks exactly the same but they have revamped the menu. As I walked in, they were still putting things up and rearranging tables. The patio looked lovely but the overcast and dark clouds made me change my mind, so I decided to sit in the bar area. I was greeted by the bartender and the server shortly came out and informed me about the new restaurant. She took the time to go through the menu and made great suggestions. I started off with a mango bellini, which was so good, then ordered the charity bread and their signature stuffed meatball. When it arrived, the charity bread was wrapped in a unique way, keeping it warm and the flavours were locked and loaded. I got to say one of the best garlic breads I have ever tried. The great thing about the charity bread is that each time its ordered, the proceeds go to a charity in Mississauga. Scaddabush menu has a meatball section, which is one of their specialities... so let me tell you, this stuffed meatball was so moist, flavourful and filling, that I will be back for some more. I missed out on the fresh mozza since its only made between 5-9pm. So for my main, I had the small Zucca ( butternut squah ravioli) and my friend had the small Capri (seafood pasta), I tried both and was equally impressed, it was delicious! I really like how there is a choice of small or large fresh pasta, which is nice if you have a big appetite or if you are practising portion control. To be honest, I had no room for dessert but I will definitely come back to check that off my list. Overall, I love anything Italiano ;) .. So I will be back!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush Scarborough is my goto for drinks & appetizers in Scarborough.  I usually order a ceaser with a fresh mozzarella plate.  I highly recommend Prosciutto.  The servers are super nice and helpful.  In addition to the great customer service, the decor of the restaurant is relaxing, hence a good place for a low-key night out."}
{"text":"Went to Scaddabush for our team holiday lunch. I found the menu very limited for anyone with any sort of dietary restrictions. I settled on a grilled vegetable sandwich with a  Cesar salad. The sandwich was bland and had absolutely no taste. the bread was greasy- I expressed my dissatisfaction to the manager who told me they spread butter on the outside of the bread and he will tell the chef. I was disgusted. The salad was so heavy on garlic I had serious indigestion all evening from it!"}
{"text":"Great food but service was a little slow but they comped the appetizer we had ordered. will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Loved the meatball, gluten-free pizza, and candlelit table tops. Great place for a date or a group of friends getting together. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"This was my first time to the Scarborough location of Scaddabush, and while I enjoyed the other locations I've been to, the food here was simply okay. 

I would recommend making reservations for weekends (luckily, my friend and I had one); soon after we sat down, at around 7:00 p.m. and onwards, there was a long line to get seated.

SERVICE: Our waitress was fantastic - she checked in on us often and had an upbeat attitude! 

APPETIZER: Naked Mozzarella *Recommend*

Scaddabush's mozzarella was and continues to be incredibly delicious - hand-pulled and perfectly soft yet chewy. The accompanied garlic bread was flavourful, while not being overly buttery/oily. One of the best parts about this dish was surprisingly, the fig/tomato jam. When spread across the garlic bread and topped with mozzarella, you get one delicious bite. 

MAIN: Summer Special - Chicken Cacciatore Brodo

This was featured on their Summer Menu, and while the photo on the menu looked very appetizing, the dish itself was rather disappointing. The spaghetti was overcooked, which was particularly upsetting since the dish was already in a broth (ie. everything seemed rather soggy and lacking any sort of texture). Also, there weren't too many pieces of chicken and the broth was on the saltier side.  

Although I would not come back for the Chicken Cacciatore Brodo, I would certainly come back for their fresh mozzarella and another pasta dish!"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin
We were looking for a chill place with a patio 
I ordered the fresh mozzarella and the spinach artichoke dip.
It was delicious!!! 
The mozzarella was soft and didn't have that weird smell you get from grocery cheese. 
The dip was equally as good. Both appetizers were served with garlic bread. 
The server we had was nice and asked a few times if we were okay with our deal.

Overall, 5 stars for the meal and ambience. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat, good food and nice architecture but it doesn't get any better from there.

Pros:
- Food tasted great, I got the chicken parmesan and it came with spaghetti. I would recommend it!
- Architecture has an Italian vibe to it, fits the type of restaurant they are going for

Cons:
- The place was dirty. I found a used fork under my table and the waitress shredded cheese all over my plate and the table
- My beer tasted very bland and old even though I had it many times before at other restaurants/bars
- Waitress was nice until a lot of people began showing up. This is where I felt like she was rushing us to free up the table
- Make a reservation because there was a 45 minute wait time!
- It was pretty loud for a restaurant, it was difficult to have a conversation"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, with great displays of Italian preserves and pastas and other sorts of mementos. 

The food seems like it would be awesome! The menu seems diverse and really simple and elegant. They even hand-stretch their mozzarella which is unique and really neat to see. 

But it's not that great. The mozzarella is really delicious, and has some great topping options. But the rest of the menu is ok. The steak in the steak frites option is small.  Like, 4-6 oz, and albeit tasty, a bit overpriced. 

It's a really nice place to meet friends or coworkers for a drink or a dessert. Try the tiramisu, or the chocolate hazelnut pudding thing."}
{"text":"I have been to Scaddabush for dinner probably over 10 times. I absolutely love all the dishes I have tried. The Mozzarella which is made fresh daily is amazing. They offer different variations with toppings but the Naked Mozza is fabulous! When I dine out, Spinach and Artichoke dip is my go-to app and Scaddabush has the best one! The spinach is smooth and not chunky like other places. I've tried several of the pizza and pastas and you really can't go wrong! The Pesto Pollo Fettucine and Zucca Ravioli are some of my favourites.

On my recent visit, I tried the Shrimp Spaghetti and it wasn't my cup of tea. It was sour and had capers (which I've never tried and have discovered is not my thing). But that doesn't affect my 5 star rating for this place because I'm sure there's someone out there who is a fan of capers.

The service is always great. Most times I've walked in without a reservation and was seated right away. When I'm craving Italian, Scaddabush is always top of mind."}
{"text":"Still good at the Downtown Toronto location. The only thing that's different are the prices compared to the location in Mississauga. Every item is 1-2 dollars more, but I guess it's downtown, afterall. 

Drinks were on sale the night we went, which was great, sampled some of their bellinis and martinis, all very good and pretty big portions. 

Food was good, the side salad that came with my meal was huge. It could have been a meal itself.

Would eat here again."}
{"text":"So-so experience.

I came with ten other friends for lunch on a Wednesday around noon. The establishment's nicely decorated and the servers are friendly. I ordered charity bread and pomodoro pizza. Both were pretty good but not by any metric better than average. I thought the bread was really tasty but some of my friends found it unsavory as the bread sits in a pool of melted butter when it's served to you! Also found it a bit bizarre that our large table (10+) was not given bread! I thought complimentary bread was a staple but I guess not :(

Pomodoro was tasty but once again similar to what you might have at any other homestyle Italian restaurant. I tried a bit of my friend's carbonara and it was yummy but the portion was extremely small for a pasta dish worth $16.83. My pizza, by contrast, was filling and in fact I ended up taking a sizable portion back home. Nice atmosphere, but the food just seems to be at par with everywhere else Italian."}
{"text":"Great food both times I've been here. Baked spaghetti and chicken parm are amazing. It's a little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for! Lots of stuff to choose from, especially their drink menu."}
{"text":"Amazing Ambience. The first thing you'll like about this place is the way the place looks. So classy.... They have their walls decorated with pickle jars and wine bottles. The music is catchy. I really wanted to steal it from them. The drinks were great and the food was above average.

Miss you Mr. Boyfriend xoxo

Pretty safe bet for a date, hang out. Has enough parking outside. 

Will I go again?? Yes yes yes...."}
{"text":"Hey, Scaddabush, you surprised the heck out of me! I had read all the reviews and still wondered if this place would be any good. It is! The mozzarella made daily in house is fan-tas-tic. Their apps are so good. Our party of 5 (1 kid under 3) all enjoyed the variety to choose from and the speed at which the food came out. The home made pasta is really, really good. And al dente. Just how I like it. 

And the waitress was on her game. She even comped the meal my husband had because he just wasn't that into it. Will be back. Will try more. So much to like here."}
{"text":"Hi to all of you, I wish a very Happy Valentines to all staff, and, to all servers at a fine restaurant. Hats off to you James for all your hard work and, your dedication to fine dining!!.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"Hi and, this message is for James and, his team and, staff of servers, and, Brandon-I wish to express my deepest apologies to him and, all for my behaviours and, ill-timed comments about his staff which I deeply regret and, I was very rude to his staff, and, also one ASM Jay and, Crystal, Evy, and I wish to express on behalf of my clinician's whom I have deeply disappointed in life, and, I am most if not all the time \"well-mannered\" in public where I have now learned appropriate behaviours for adults. I am apologizing for comments not only to his staff (last November and, December buying  a beer on my 2nd day) and, to his wife. Thanks J.P."}
{"text":"Hey,

Stopped by for a date night to here.  We chose for a quieter vibe then jack Astors.

We ordered the blue goose pear martins.  These were a nice choice and I recommend it to the Cosmo crowd!

We had the first mozzarella plate for an app of the day.  It was really good.  Came with a fig jam and prosciutto.  I recommend this app.  Be warned it will fill you up for later on.

We shared a caesar salad.  It was a regular fair.  A lightly sauced one, so it was welcomed.

We enjoy a pesto pollo pene and the carbonara.  Both were heavy cream sauces.  I recommend both, but when sharing I think to much cream.

Overall the staff and food were great.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"I've been a few times all of which I had horrendous service! One time I asked 4 servers for my bill including the girl serving us, when I asked for a manager as I waited over 20 minutes for a bill she brushed it off. I wouldn't suggest anyone go to the square one location. If I could give less than 1 star I would"}
{"text":"I have been to Scaddabush for a few times.  I love their pasta there.

My last visit wasn't the best cause I booked a table but when I arrived, I was advised that my table is not ready because the previous party was still finishing off.  And I ended up having to wait for 30 mins with kids!  Sucks!  But they made up by giving us free appetizers which cheered me up a bit.  I think most importantly is that they do care and try to make their customers happy.

I will go back again."}
{"text":"Went here for date night for the first time. The food was fairly good but it was quite expensive. Over $80 for the two of us and I just had a salad. Overall I would only go back for the dessert. The apple ravioli was absolutely delicious! Apart from the dessert the food was fine just not worth as much as you pay. Not a ton of flavor and small porpotions."}
{"text":"I've had real Italian, and this place doesn't even come close.  Very disappointing, as I've seen this restaurant revamp itself from the Alice Fazooli's of my time to this.  Customer service was great, the manager was awesome at taking care of us, but just overall unimpressed with their Capri pasta and \"charcuterie board\", which is wayyyyy too salty.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"So this must be the \"IT\" spot on a Saturday evening in Mississauga cuz it felt like a million and one people were waiting to be seated.  

This place is a fairly large place and a busy place I must say.  Now the food and the service was good, which I rate about 4 stars...however, the downside is that we were told that they do not take reservations on the weekend.  I find this a little crazy especially when you want to do a group dinner.  Also, they explained ahead of time that they do not take reservations on weekends and that the best time to come if you have a group is at 5pm to grab a table.  Also, when the birthday girl arrived at the restaurant, there was a seating area big enough for our group but they said it was reserved for corporate...contradicting the reservation policy, but it is what it is...which is why I had to give it 3 stars.

Our sitting area was a tight squeeze, our table wobbled and the chairs were not the comfiest thing I've ever sat on.

We had a great server...very personable yet professional.  Good job Nick! 

I got a Caesar to drink, which was okay...could have been a bit stronger.  I got an app of fried artichoke and cauliflower, which I liked.  My friend got her usual Chicken Limone, which she loves...personally not my fav, but a light meal.  

All and all...a good night out for my friend's birthday."}
{"text":"I returned last week care of Catalina. My colleague and I had a fabulous meal, the food is really good there! This time my customer service experience was much better. A manager came to see me and I explained what had happened and offered constructive feedback for improvement which I believe she genuinely took to heart. 

I will definitely return for the food! I had the delicious Butcher pizza and my colleague had the Chicken Limone which was creamy yummy!"}
{"text":"i was SO excited to come and try this place cuz italian is my fav and the reason it is getting 4 stars is cuz of the CHEESE.  They make their mozzarella in house daily and i tired buratta (Infused with honey and truffle cream, focaccia crostini).  MY. GOD. this is actually heavenly.  I would come back just to eat this to myself.  You can actually taste the honey in the cheese and eating it with the crostini is the best thing ever!!

The caesar salad is boring and overdressed. Tried their straight up stuff meatball.  I didn't find this to be anything crazy, def not worth the price you pay for one (although huge) meatball.  Also, their Diavolo pizza (Spicy chicken, mozzarella, Pecorino cheese, caramelized onions, roasted grape tomatoes) was a BIG disappointment.   I came expecting great pizza but it was just like eating flatbread with toppings. saddd. The portion is big and they give you scissors to cut it which is nice, but yeah don't bother trying their pizza.

Lastly, I had the Butternut squash ravioli (zucca - grated Grana Padano cheese, hazelnut butter cream sauce, roasted squash, fried sage).  I was the MOST excited for this coming here and we ordered the large size.  ok, it is NOT a large portion at all.  They gave us a total of (8) ravioli.  like are you kidding me?! That is the biggest rip off ever.  If i ordered the small portion, does that mean I get 4 pieces? Portion sizes for a child honestly.  Sizes aside, the ravioli itself was amazinggg, the fried sage on top was the nicesttt touch, and there was lots of squash bits on the side.  If I came back here I would order this again but I guess i would have to get the social portion for myself. Fix your pasta portions scaddabush!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice staff. The service was slow because they were way busier then they anticipated. They gave us free stuff due the wait. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus... this place was ahhhmazing.

Initially, my friends and I came because we heard that they made fresh mozzarella, but it turns out that they have great menu items that are just as great, if not better, than the fresh mozzarella.

First off, I love love loveee the atmosphere and the decor. The restaurant was dimly lit with rustic lighting and candles, which were a lovely touch. The tables were wooden, and again, went with that rustic feel. Everything was just amazing. I think I'm doing a horrible job at describing this place and I'm not doing it any justice, so just pay them a visit.

Second, and the most important, was the food. I needed to be wheeled out of here when I was done. Here's a rundown of what we ordered:

-Fresh Mozzarella with Pingue Prosciutto: the crostinis were really good, as was the fig jam, sea salt, proscuitto and the cheese of course. We also asked for a side of the tomato jam which went well with the cheese. I suggest spreading some fig jam on the crostini, sprinkling some sea salt on it, then topping it off with some cheese. It was sooo good!

-Straight up meatball: We just had the classic meatball. I'm not a huge fan of beef or any type of ground up meat, but this meatball was delicious! It was doused in tomato sauce and cheese and sat atop a piece of bread... it was just so good

-Bianca Pizza: I thought this pizza was really good... and it was... until about a few slices in. This pizza, in theory, is really yummy- the caramelized onions add a bit of sweetness and the tomatoes, a bit of tang, but the herbs and overkill of parmesan cheese made it just a slight bit too salty for my friends' and I's liking.
Sidenote: We let the waitress know when she asked us how we liked the food and she was nice enough to take the pizza off the bill... Grade A customer service.

-Chocolate panna cotta: I really wanted to love this, and I did love it for a few bites, until the balsamic flavor became too much to handle. The chocolate of the panna cotta was done well- it wasn't too sweet and it wasn't dull, but the balsamic flavor became very overpowering after a few bites. It added a nice tang in the beginning, but after, that's all you seem to taste.

-Tiramisu: delicious... simply delicious. The espresso flavor really came through on this one

-Zeppole: Yum! Who doesn't like dough balls and chocolate?

-Blood orange and cucumber mojito: mojito done to the next level. It's a regular mojito that tastes so much better than a regular mojito. Sooo good. I will never drink regular mojitos again.

Overall, I had an awesome time here. Our waitress was amazing. She gave us tons of suggestions and was very knowledgable about the menu. All of the staff members who came by our table were really nice and friendly- especially the hostess who stood by the door and brought us over to our table. I will, most definitely, be back for another visit. Everything was great! 

P.S. We were told by our waitress that there is a live DJ on Thurs, Fri, and Sat nights! and $7 cocktails and $5 pints!"}
{"text":"I find this place so incredibly average. This is a place I often get stuck going to due to its proximity to my work and office tradition. We usually go during lunch when I find the service to be pretty slow.  The manager did comp our meals last time due to the food taking over 35 minutes to come out at lunch without us having to say a word which was pretty nice. When the food did arrive, it was very lackluster. My burger was dry and my colleague's meal came with missing components. The value isn't great either; East Side Mario's quality with Terroni prices. If you want a big, average, chain restaurant to host an event at, this might do the trick. But do not come here for the food.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"I still love this place. I've been here 4 times with friends and family. Jenny is still my favourite bartender! The place is always fairly busy every time I've been here.

For appetizers we had the Charity Bread and the Char Grilled Calamari. The bread was a great deal for $2, but I thought it was a bit soggy in the middle. 

We ordered a bunch of mains to share. The Crusted Tilapia was delicious and cooked just right. It's a great option when you are looking for something lighter. The crust on the tilapia gave it a nice flavour. We ordered the Capri, which is fettuccine with shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari, and red peppers, in a tomato sauce.  I preferred the Spaghetti and Stuffed Meatball, which was tasty. I love that they make all their pasta fresh. 

One of my favourite salads is the Mercatto salad. This has ancient grains, apple, almonds, spinach, radicchio, baby arugula, grapes, and lovely cider vinaigrette."}
{"text":"Sick place, food was good & so was the service only complaint would be a little loud but besides that 10/10!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had their signature meatball sandwich with tomato soup. 
The soup was good and the sandwich seemed a little dry and small. I had the same at the Scarborough location and I remember it being more juicy/greasy which enhanced the flavour, too."}
{"text":"We went with a group of people and had the homemade mozzarella, a pizza, some bread, zucca ravioli, a classic straight up meatball and some tiramisu. It was all very delicious and the waiter was attentive."}
{"text":"Second time here today and I am SO glad I came back to try the Charity bread and Zucca. I love that they have size options (Small, Large, and Social) I ordered a small which looked little at first, but I ended up feeling completely satisfied having accompanied my plate with the Charity bread. Can't say any other dishes stood out to me. The restaurant itself is beautiful, spacious, and lots of tables. Their patio is quite small but intimate, and I much prefer it over Jack Astors (a few steps ahead) because of the few smokers that come to the restaurant, much more family friendly."}
{"text":"Cane here a second time and got some vege options, here's what I thought!

Zucca ravioli- this is my absolutely favorite dish! It's ravioli filled with butternut squash, but it's sweeten so it gives off a sweet potato kind of taste.  I love sweet potato so this was the perfect dish! The creme which its spread with and the sprinkles on top was a perfect combination. It's filling, I got about 10 pieces of golf ball sized raviolis in a  dish of size small. 

Baked Penne Carbornara - I customized this dish so that I got it without the bacon and instead sprinkled it with fried butternut squash. To be honest, this dish was a bit plain, it kind of gave off a KD Mac and cheese kind of taste. Barely any flavour to it. The dish was also very watery for some reason, so it got a bit messy to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with friends. Good thing we had reservations, cause it was packed! I really liked the vibe at this restaurant. Lively, friendly and casual, with really personable service.  And the food was delicious. I loved the in-house made mozzarella and pasta. 

The fried calamari was ok, although I prefer larger pieces as opposed to the small rings that were served. My only other qualm would be that the tiramisu was disappointing. It was more cream than anything and lacked the cookie and espresso crunch. Coming from an Italian, it didn't come close to momma's home made tiramisu!"}
{"text":"This is a great find in the downtown core, enough to warrant repeat visits from me in quick succession.

Like:  Almost everything.  Prices are incredibly reasonable for downtown Toronto, food quality is superb and service is great.  I'd recommend going for dinner instead of lunch to try the homemade mozzarella.  

Dislike:  Minimal menu items have been misses rather than hits.  Service can be spotty but is usually great.

Really enjoy this place.  Meatball, mozzarella and shareable portions are great ideas for dinner.  Lunch menu is the same with a few omissions.  Glad to have this place close by and will definitely be back over and over again.."}
{"text":"I like this place for after work drinks.  The mozzarella and bruschetta are delicious and fresh accompaniment to half-prices wine by the glass.  They make the mozzarella fresh and it really tastes so good.  It is sad but I can eat a whole one by myself.  For a chain this place is a hit for me and the service is attentive.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Fresh mozzarella and pasta are the reasons to come. Consistency is hit or miss, though. My second visit the spaghetti was mushy and had to send it back. Still well worth it for fresh pasta. 

Tried the pizza, didn't like it. The charity bread is super oily. Too bad no real bread options here. 

Mozzarella and pasta and fantastic though."}
{"text":"This was very good. Yelp suggested that it was good for families... Indeed. Food was hot, tasty and plentiful. Hipster items (polenta bites) and classics (meatball and homemade pasta) were all very good. 

Kind of noisy. (Not a bad thing with all my kids!). A little dark, made it hard to read the menu. 

Good selection of wine. 

Large menu. 

Good selection for kids. 

We walked in without reservations on a Wednesday at 7:30p.  It was packed by the time we left."}
{"text":"We are halal food eaters, and managed to find 3 items on the menu that were halal from cooking process aspect I.e. after asking a few related queries from the hostess. The bruschetta was spot on, haven't had better yet. Crusted Snapper was simply wow, with parmesan and black pepper to top it with. Shows that the chef takes the pain of putting it together .. my wife enjoyed a shrimp pasta, and a salad. The host confirmed with the cook that the utensils used for seafood, are exclusive from other meats .. though asked for a favour to confirm if not. They obliged and seemingly the full house ensured the required customer care. Next time I will be going for their salmon entree. Just a star less, since being in Mississauga for a long time, they should introduce a few more entrees that halal observing Muslims can enjoy too."}
{"text":"If you're there for dinner, please try their mozzarella! It is amazing.
Their pastas are extremely overpriced and do not taste good. I've tried their lobster pasta, stuffed meatball+spaghetti, and carbonara - all underwhelming and expensive. My friend had the beet salad and loved it though. Service is great despite the busy crowds."}
{"text":"I really like this place.
I have not come to this area of square one to eat in some time. In the fall a friend said we should get some drinks at Jack Astors. For some reason Jack Astors seems to be closed, and S.B is one step away, so we went.

The service was good. The initial visit was some wait time but it was fine. The other 3 times I came here was at off-peak times, so no wait time. 

My all time favourite here is the grill cheesed sandwich. It is huge. You could probably have half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It is served with a delicious jam to help the cheese stand out, and give a tart taste.

The osso bucco bites were amazing. I love sweet and savoury combinations, and this is overwhelmingly one of them. Served with what seems to be honey, it is savoury and dry and delicious.

The Roasted Chicken is extremely well-prepared. 

The grilled Calamari is okay - possibly more flavorful when fried.

The servers definitely know their product which helps.


Wine list looks good. Prices are average for a big box restaurant (although this is in the processes of opening new locations) $18.00 -$29.00 per entree.. You are getting great portions as well. 
Great potential at this restaurant. I think it is good mainstream Italian food. Did I mention they serve fresh cheese made on premises there on certain days/times?"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place since Alice Fazooli's left and I'm so mad that I didn't try it sooner. My friends and I split the Naked Mozzarella appetizer with Classic Charity bread. As for the main I got the stuffed meatball and spaghetti. All three were amazing. The mozzarella was just delicious, all store-bought cheese will be ruined for me after having that creamy salty mozzarella that they make in the restaurant. The crostini that comes with it is just as crunchy and tasty as it sounds. The Charity bread was good too, but I found it too sweet for me. I loved the meatball and spaghetti (that's also made from scratch), but I was too full to even make a dent in my main dish. Also props to our server Natalya for being courteous and humorous during our three hour girls night out :P"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this restaurant is amazing. It's not overcrowded like other places downtown, giving it an intimate dining experience. There is no waiting time for a table, and no rush for you to leave. The food here is pretty good,  I'd rate it 7.5/10.

Service was a bit slow, but still decent otherwise. Feiendly hostesses and servers. 

The DJ there, on the other hand?  Absolutely terrible. She needs to be fired. I dined on a Saturday night and we were told that we could request songs to be played. So we requested a song politely, and she gave us attitude in what she probably thought was a quirky reply of \"I don't know, can I?\" It came out sarcastic and unwarranted. 

I really enjoyed my dining experience there and would love to dine here again. The only thing keeping from doing that is that DJ. Her condescending attitude is out of place in this industry. It would have been a 4/5, but I took one off solely because of her. These little things can really effect ones dining experience."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Scaddabush and have visited the Yonge/Gerard location many times. Every experience has been great, up until now. My girlfriends and I had dinner at Scaddabush last year on New Years Eve and had a great experience, so we decided to stick with the tradition and come again this year, because we knew the food would be great, atmosphere would be fun, and music would be great. Sadly we set our expectations too high, because we were extremely disappointed.

The food was decent, and the DJ was pretty bad (the usual DJ was at the new Front location I believe), however we didn't realize how much a server contributes to your overall experience. Also doesn't help that we ordered a PITCHER of Sangria, and to our surprise, were brought a pitcher that was literally half full. Why am I paying $27 for a glass full of ice and barely 3 glasses of sangria? Being a long-time customer, I can see that this location has drastically decreased the quality of their sangrias--it used to be delicious and a generous serving. Our server barely ever came by to our table, even though we saw him multiple times catering to the table beside us. We gave up waiting for him and started just asking other servers for assistance. We didn't even get a bottle of water for the table to get us started, until 30 minutes later when we asked a bus boy, after realizing our server wasn't bringing it. It was extremely insulting seeing our server paying so much attention to the other tables, while we were sitting there forever waiting for something as simple as water, waiting to have our order taken, didn't even get offered pepper/Parmesan cheese with our pasta (I had to wave down another server after seeing him walk by with the cheese). We were clearly unhappy. What makes it worse is our server still slapped on a fake smile and acted like everything was okay, didn't even try to rectify the situation and try to make our experience better. I understand if it is a busy night, I have experienced this before, but the fact that our server never once apologized or acknowledged his inattentiveness to our table. To add even MORE insult, during the New Years countdown, last year we were given complimentary champagne to ring in the new year, which was a nice touch and very memorable. We were looking forward to that this year. To our surprise, we noticed that apparently only the customers sitting on the bar side of the restaurant received free champagne. Apparently we were sitting in the wrong section of the restaurant because we felt like we were being disregarded in every possible way. When our server finally came by, we mentioned the champagne because we noticed a few tables had some. He made a joke and said okay, we'll bring you champagne on the house. We shouldn't have been surprised when HE NEVER CAME BACK WITH ANYTHING. Not even our bill! Had to wait another 20 minutes until he came back, and we asked for the bill. Honestly ridiculous, we spent half our time waiting and trying to get his attention. Not a great way to ring in the new year, when all we wanted was a laid-back night of good food and good vibes. Can't say my friends and I will be back at this location, let alone recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"If you have never been here, this is itself a destination at Square One.  Fresh pastas, awesome salads and wonderful servers.  The environment is a luxury rustic feel and you feel welcomed from the minute you walk in right through to when you leave.  It's worth going if you're near Square One in Mississauga or just looking for a place to get away and relax."}
{"text":"They make homemade mozzarella here which is absolutely delicious. My daughter loved the Prosciutto and spinach Pizza as well as their spaghetti with giant meatball that we ordered. The Calamari was also very crispy and delicious. Over all I would love to come back and try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"I honestly HATE this place! I wish it would go back to being an Alice Fazoolis! 

Their menu is mediocre and there are not enough pasta options! I tried their fresh mozzarella and it really wan't that special- I've had better!

What I hated the most was the service! The waitress rarely checked on our table, and we had to keep asking for our water to be refilled by others passing by. When I told her I was not happy with my caesar salad due to its weird wasabi like spiceyness which ended up being, because of the garlic they put in it. 

She blamed it on the garlic that was being picked during the season, but I am quite sure the cooks should be tasting it before serving it and adjust it accordingly. Then she took it away and did not offer me a replacement.

Not a happy camper, will probably never go back again."}
{"text":"The food was really good and decor is amazing BUT the service isn't good at all. It took 45 minutes for a pint of beer and 1.5 hours to get the food. I hope they do something about the service to be more efficient."}
{"text":"Food is way better than jacks but its more for families which makes this place classy but kinda boring. I just come for food. Pricey but its really good for a chain restaurant/bar. even though food is good dont expect anything too crazy lol. I rate this 4 stars because its clean food thats cooked well."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scaddabush at Square One and I've also been to this location before for an event party but this was my first time as a diner at this particular location.

I had made a reservation the day of online for 715pm but circumstances changed and we were available to dine at 630 instead.  It wasn't a problem for seating for 630 instead of having to come back 45 minutes later so that was nice.

We were seated upstairs where the big tables are but we had a comfortable booth for 4.  When I say the big tables the upstairs of this place has a large area with large 12-14 seat tables (2) so this area can hold quite the party upstairs.  We were off to the side in a quieter section in a padded seat booth.

We hadn't made up our mind with drinks or the menu so our server said she'd be back and give us some time.  I rather think she gave us a lot of time and eventually returned.  We ordered a few drinks and everything at once since we had a good amount of time to review our options.  Everything we ordered it seemed as if our server was trying to get us to have everything at once (salad, appetizers etc) although she did ask us if that was ok.  I don't know if the kitchen was busy or if everything is brought at once she gets help as opposed to having to wait on us more times?  I wasn't sure but for whatever reason she almost seemed motivated to convince us to take everything at once. 

I had sort of wanted my calamari first and as I did last second order it as she was going away she didn't ask if I had wanted that first or with everything else.  It seems she made the assumption that we'd want that later too.  

A different server brought our drinks to us and I had asked her if I could ask her about the calamari we ordered.  I asked her because our server was not coming back as she seemed busy.  I asked her if that comes out beforehand and her response sort of threw me... she said normally if things on the menu are appetizers they come first and if not then it was put into the system incorrectly as a screwup.  That not the answer I was looking for or at least one that I thought was very professional.  She basically threw her team mate under the bus!

I had asked our server when she finally came around again (she was tending to a lot of patrons) and asked her if it was put in as an app or with the entire meal.  She said it was put in with everything and I had asked her if it could be changed and she said she'd check.  She came back and told me that it was put in with everything basically it couldn't be brought out sooner than the rest of orders and if there was anything she could do for us otherwise.  I said well if it couldn't come out sooner we'd just hang out and such.  I was at least satisfied that she said it was put into the system as such and offered an alternative or other options possibly.  

In total our group of four ordered a calamari app, stuffed meatball app, the social Caesar salad (for sharing), a margherita pizza, a sophia pizza, chicken parm, chicken limone, apple raviloli dessert and drinks.

The calamari is decent but I've had better.  The stuffed meatball is so freaking tasty.  It's salty and rich because of the sauce and cheese but wow is it ever good.  My problem with it is that is seemed really smaller compared to how I originally remember it.  I remember it being a half pound and I don't know if it's still that size or not but it just visually looked significantly much smaller than I remember it.  The salad is amazing.  I could go to Scaddabush for just their Caesar salad but really it's just a salad but one of the best I've had in memory.  It's VERY garlicky and I could see it being too strong for some folk but not me.

My dish was the chicken limone which was grilled chicken breast in lemon sauce served with roasted potatoes and green beans.  It was good but just not kick ass.  I had some of my wife's pizza (sophia) which has chicken and goat cheese (white pizza) and it was just ok.  

The apple ravioli are sort of neat.  They are like apple pie pockets and are served with a tiny scoop of ice cream.  You receive 2 raviolis to an order and they're about 4 inches in diameter.

There are some things good about Scaddubush but overall it's just an OK experience.  I can't say that we received as much attention as I would have liked in that we were waiting for our server for a while, our drinks and overall I just felt neglected.  I get it that there was a big party upstairs yesterday and perhaps they soaked much of the attention of our servers I don't know but I don't want to feel like we're not as important or necessarily feel pressured to take all our food at once (apps not coming out first).  I mean it was a Tuesday evening and yes it was dinner time and yes I came earlier than I said I would but still...

I had out of town guests for dinner and it's always a special time when my wife and I get to spend time with them and I guess I just wanted everything to be perfect and it just wasn't."}
{"text":"Ahh. Where to even begin with this area. They added a food court expansion called Taste Mrkt in the STC and everyone were on the hype train (especially Chipotle fangirls). However, 1 month before Taste Mrkt opened came Scaddabush. As of when this review is published, it's been 2 months since it opened. So, I was eager to find out about this place.

The location is in Scarborough Town Centre (the area, not the mall) and it shares the same building as Jack Astor's. When I walked in there were conversations EVERYWHERE and that was a good thing. I guess everyone was having a blast.

Unfortunately, we didn't get Tristan(who I checked in yelp reviews that he/she is the best server ever in Scaddabush at this location). Instead, we got a girl server(I don't know her name but she is nice). Service was really snappy(however, for the dessert menu we have to wait 20 minutes). However, it's not about service. It's about FOOD.

For our apps, we ordered charity bread and fresh mozzarella with crostini. The charity bread tastes ok and it was oily and greasy. On the other hand, the mozzarella kicked off a great start for a awesome dinner. And, Miranda(the person who was making the mozzarella) was awesome at her job. And the crostini is dope.

We came here as a group of 4, so we bought 4 entrées. I got the baked carbonara while the rest got shrimp pasta, chicken fingers(part of kids menu) and shrimp and chicken pasta. As far as I know, everyone what satisfied. As for the baked carbonara, it looks like a baked shrimp Alfredo at Red Lobster (you might not get it now). However, this might be the best entrée at Scaddabush. It's so good, that I was full in the first few bites.

Don't you know the kid's menu I said earlier? Well, it came with free gelato. Because of that, I want to get a dessert. So, I got the chocolate jar cake. The presentation looked like a mess and the top is burnt. But, deep down, it tastes amazing. Although the dessert menu was enjoyable, I want to see nougat on the list.

Overall, despite a few complaints(like waiting 20 minutes for a small dessert menu) Scaddabush is a great fit for Scarborough. However, this Scaddabush is 2nd. As for which Scaddabush I would recommend, I would go to the Mississauga location near Square One. However, the Scarborough location is dope and I would recommend it for people who haven't tried Scaddabush before.

{"text":"Came here today around 6pm and the tables started filling up! Although there is ample space in the restaurant, you could tell this is a popular place to dine.

I had ordered the Truffle Balsamic Mozzarella ball (just under $15) for an appetizer and it came with 4 slices of toast and a ball of mozzarella cheese drizzled with truffle oil, balsamic vinaigrette and honey. It was an amazing appetizer. It was light and tasty, and the truffle oil was not overpowering. 

My main dish was their \"The Butcher\" pizza (just under $18). It came with spicy salami, red onions, bacon, and Italian sausage. It was delicious and definitely a hit for any meat lovers out there!

My partner had ordered their special for summer, which was the mussel spaghetti ($15.95) and I found that the mussels used were small and cheap. The sauce had a strong fish taste, which I did not care for.

They do have a workperks discount for 15% off your entire bill, so if you have it, make sure you let them know before you ask for the bill!"}
{"text":"Been an extremely loyal customer to Scaddabush and have been going quite frequently until a recent change in management (i think?) the service was horrible and food is not on par to quality standard anymore. Quite disappointed as this was a go-to restaurant for us. The last couple times we went pasta was mushy, hair was found in the dishes, and burger was burnt. Sent an email to scaddabush yonge and gerrard management and no response from the GM.  Will most likely not return unless someone was hosting their birthday or event there (and even so I would not recommend the restaurant)"}
{"text":"Scadda on gerrard has always been a favourite of mine. We were so happy to know that one opened up closer to home and we didn't have to trek downtown for some comfort food. Many people that reviewed for this location stated that the food was not seasoned well, nor was the service great... but the 2 times I've been back, I only experienced great service, flavourful food and great atmosphere. It does get busy on a weekend, but if you go on a weeknight you can generally get a seat within 5 minutes of entering the restaurant.

Fan favourites:

Truffle mozzarella. Can't go wrong with home made mozzarella filled with honey and truffle. it always made perfectly and tasty and never a miss for us.

Deep friend calamari. When we first went when they opened the calamari was soggy and the batter was not fried right.. but the next time we went, it was done nicely. The only sad side to this dish is that it use to be bigger in portion, and the price has definitely increased (i think because of minimum wage increase) but the sauces that come to dip were great

Carbonara, served in a mini skillet and great for one person. try subbing the pasta with fettuccine, it taste so flavorful of bacon and parm goodness!

Chicken Parm, hubby seems to always order the chicken parm. You get a huge piece of chicken with their homemade mozzarella on top. Fried nicely and still has a crunchy when cutting into the cutlet! 

Spaghetti and meatball, huge in portion size, and always piping hot when i order this! Get it with their spicy tomato sauce cause it truly adds a kick.

Overall, scaddabush is a chain, but it definitely hits the spot when you want some comfort italian food. Don't expect super authentic Italian... if you do, go to a restaurant that isn't a chain!"}
{"text":"I liked the Signature Meatball.  They serve classic Signature Meatballs and also ones that are stuffed.  I chose the stuffed one to try.  It was stuffed with cheese and pepperoni!  I hadn't had such a big meatball like that before.  I really liked it since the meat was very tender and you could taste the cheese and pepperoni sausage embedded inside the meatball.  You really have to try this out for yourself to see what it's like!"}
{"text":"Excellent tomato sauce. Bolognese has a nice taste of ginger in the meat sauce. 

Appetizers were also tasty."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING 

I work at a restaurant myself, I went out to eat and noticed many things that are just wrong. 

SERVICE: maybe half the servers look like they dont want to be there, they're super slow and immediately forget a task at hand, I had to get another server to ask him to get us the bill, he never checked back on us regularly. The server asked if we wanted drinks but before asking all of us, as soon as he heard water he ran away. The chefs were obviously very young, slapping on food on plates, the presentation didn't wow us for the price we pay.

FOOD: the quality of the food is pretty low, poorly seasoned, not flavorful, pretty mediocre aside from the mozzarella. My friend had a pizza, pretty boring. We expected difference in the real wood ovens but not rly. 

I got food poisoning after eatting their mussels. I could tell nobody checks to see if the mussels are all open before coming out. shrimp was cut into pieces which I felt was just wierd. No hints of wine aroma. 

ATMOSPHERE: Its great, loud, and messy. 


CONCLUSION: If I want pasta I'm going to Canyon Creek next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Scaddabush before but it was my first time at this location. I came here with two friends and we ordered the $50 special that came with 4 apps and a pitcher of sangria. Can I just say that - it was ALOT of food for 3 people. We were shocked at how big the shareables were. The service was not bad. Food wise it tasted mediocre, nothing too special and the sangria didn't taste like it had any wine in it."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is a nice addition to the restaurants in the downtown core. Something classy but trendy - perfect for after work functions or a casual dinner. 

I believe it's Alice Fazooli's rebranded. I've been to the Mississauga location a few times, but first time here.

Food was a little bland for everyone, including myself. I remember really liking the baked carbonara from the other location and recommended it to everyone, but they weren't impressed. 

Service was excellent though. I have to commend the servers for knowing how to handle a big group."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a chain restaurant.  For starters we ordered the charity bread and calamari.  The bread came in a small square cast iron pan the portion was ok for sharing between 2-3 people.  There was a nice garlicky flavor to it although it was very very oily.  Our calamari portion was tiny given the price and the pieces were cut very small..flavor was ok but by the time it reached our table it was just about cold--I probably would not order it again it's just not good value.  

Our mains were one each of the Butcher and Diavolo pizzas and a lobster spaghetti.  The pizzas were a reasonable size and were well prepared.  The balsamic drizzle on the Diavolo really gave the chicken a nice zing.  For us the standout of the meal was the lobster spaghetti.  The dish contained decent sized pieces of lobster meat and the Rose sauce was balanced--not too tart or sweet.  Pasta was cooked al dente. Service was excellent. Our server was very busy but managed to provide good service."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a small group recently. I had the snapper which I found to quite good. Also heard good comments about the pizza.
Service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere pleasant.
Would return."}
{"text":"First time here:

Mood: Great ambiance. Love the design. 

Food: was pretty good. 
Polenta tots: delicious 

Caesar salad a little over dressed. 

Charity bread (3 cheese): pretty good - little salty for my liking. Also, when it says u get the charity bread for $3.95 w/pasta it's only the basic (didn't know that until I got the bill ). 

Pizza delicious. 

Zucca ravioli: not bad just not in my palette; it was more sweet than my liking for ravioli. 

Cheesecake: it was good but the crust not a fan at all; it says it's a hazelnut crust but to me it tasted like bread crumbs (not sure if that's just the taste of hazelnut crumble). 

Service was a little slow - felt a little abandoned. 

Overall experience: great date night location, food was good, waiter service was okay. Overall I would suggest it and probably visit again."}
{"text":"Scaddabush had a nice after work drinks/dinner atmosphere on the Friday night we went. They played top 40s during our dinner which was nice!  I went on a date here and it was incredibly loud upstairs near two parties. We asked to be moved to a quieter spot which the servers happily did - they moved us downstairs to a quieter booth.

Main Course:

Zucca Ravioli was great! I loved the cream sauce and the filling inside the ravioli. 

Margarita Pizza was great too. Cheesy, saucy and a great basic pizza.

Dessert: 

Lemon Sorbet was wasn't pleasant to eat at all. I felt like we were eating bitter slushy that wasn't even slushy but icy. 

The customer service was 3/5 as well. The server took quite a long time to check up on us or to fill in our glasses of water. I had to put my empty glass on the edge of our table for her to notice us when she passed by.

I loved that they had a gender neutral accessibility washroom on the first floor. That was great."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! Definitely my favourite out of all these types of restaurants (milestones .. moxies etc) I ordered two appetizers - the bread with proscuitto and their store made Mozzarella cheese ball + calamari. Both were 10/10! Mouth watering and I wanted more when I finished LOL. I ordered the breakfast pizza as my main, and although I can't handle spice too well, I finished the whole pizza, it was just that good. I had a bit of the pastas as well and they also tasted amazing! The atmosphere inside has a rustic feel, it can get quite busy as well, we had to wait 45 mins but I don't mind waiting if it's for some goood food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and music . Clean restrooms as well. Service is quick and awesome customer service"}
{"text":"I love the Scaddabush location on yonge street, so definitely wanted to give this place a try.

Came here for lunch with colleagues during the opening week. The restaurants ambience is perfect- almost feels like you're in Hogwarts (big and spacious, with wooden tables and lamps). They also occupy a large area, so getting a table here shouldn't be too hard.

The staff are extremely friendly, but definitely felt like there was way too many staff. On our way in, we were probably greeted by 10 different hostesses.

The only negative thing I have to say, is the wait for the food. Granted I came with a party of 8, but our food took over 45 minutes to come out (which I do not understand given the amount of kitchen staff and waitresses standing around doing nothing). 

My recommendations (if this is your first visit here): the giant stuffed meatball over a bed of freshly made pasta. The mozzarella is also a wonderful appetizer."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for lunch at around noon. Place was fairly empty but beginning to fill up. The dining area is really spacious and the decor is very rustic. 

We ordered the regular size pesto pollo fettucine, the butcher pizza, and a side of polenta tots. The water tasted kind of weird...Had a garlic bread taste to it which was off putting. 

This was my second time coming here and the pasta never fails to disappoint! It tastes fresh and not processed at all like at other chain restaurants. I do believe it is made in house! The portion looks small but it really does fill you up with the heavy sauce and toppings. Super delicious. 

The butcher pizza was well made as well. Hand tossed dough and a bunch of toppings that complement each other. The pizza cutter it comes with is pretty unique too; you get to cut it how you like and can even share amongst your table members. 

The polenta tots were a nice, sort of \"fried\" side with everything. It is basically hand tossed dough balls with cheese and breading. I'd recommend getting this for 4.97 instead of the sociables version because that costs twice as much for the same amount (it just comes with cheese and tomato sauce). 

Overall, it was a nice experience here. The service was friendly and it seems consistent even when I went on a packed night. I believe if you go here before the end of 2016, they will give you a coupon to use for the month of Jan 2017 which is $20 off a bill of $50+. That is what I received at the end of my meal at least. Great discount!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a couple of friends. They picked the restaurant, and I walked in with little expectation for a restaurant right by SqOne. I was pleasantly surprised. 
The food was fresh and delicious, and the drinks were great (could be stronger). 

Tried the Prosciutto & Mozzarella board - the pairings were perfect. Bread, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, fig jam, and sea salt - heavenly. 
Diavolo pizza - not usually a fan of chicken on pizza, but this was good. Spicy, just as it should be. 
Chocolate and Raspberry Tartufo - I rarely order desserts at restaurants, so this was a treat!

Overall, really good! Scaddabush would be my pick out of all the restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Opposite the Town Centre, right next to the Jack Astor's, Scaddabush opened up a location in Scarborough!

It was hard to spot at first, seeing how it was RIGHT next to Jack Astor's. I mean, the entire building is connected and the two restaurants even share the same washrooms! But with the sparkly night lights that glittered the patio, it guided us to Scaddabush.

We sat on the huge table that was pretty close to the entrance and it was massively big, along with high stools. It was quite odd. Actually, the entirety of Scaddabush's decor was quite odd to me - more on that later~

Focusing more on pastas for our orders, we got the Baked Penne Carbonara which had parmesan cream sauce, smoked bacon, scallions, garlic, black pepper, topped with a soft poached egg!

I'm not a fan of penne as a pasta, I like penne when it's with a salad. So I don't really like this as much. The egg was definitely soft and yolky, bits of bacon where sprinkled everywhere which was great too. But definitely won't be my first choice.

Our server came by after to ask if we wanted any pepper or cheese for our dishes as well!

I got the Fettuccine Capri which had shrimp, scallops, PEI mussels, squid, roasted red peppers, scallions, lemon zest and tomato sauce.

Tomato sauce turns me off. Wow, picky eater much Teri?  No... I just know what I like Heehee. But I really like seafood! So I still got it anyways and I really really enjoyed it .
Though some parts of the pasta were clumped together (which I avoided), the sauce was good and had tons of seafood in it!

At Scaddabush, there are several sizes: small, large and social. Social size is to share with a group of friends... I wasn't feeling too hungry that day, so I got a small size. Even then, the small size is pretty huge. My friend got the Fettuccine Capri in the large size and it was like humongous! She definitely couldn't finish it, so she gave some to the others.
However, some dishes like the Baked Penne Carbonara only came in one size.

I added cheese to my Fettuccine Capri because who doesn't love cheesy pastas?!

First and foremost, my dish was at least a 3.5/5...
One of our friends ordered one of the pizzas, and it was extremely salty! It was horrible.
& Another friend had ordered another set of pasta as well but her portion came out to be smaller even though they were both a large size.

Not only that, the entirety of Scaddabush to me, just seems really unorganized? or there's no consistency in themes? Everything was neither here or there.

It was my first time visiting Scaddabush, and have not been to any other locations so I'm not sure if this was like a thing they do for their restaurant.

To sum it up:

Decor:
- Their tables were of all shapes and sizes... small tables but also really large tables (like ours with the high stools), as well as booths.
- Their decor was a mix of textures and tiles - so one minute it was hardwood, and then they have elements of brick as well in random places. Plus they had a pinata of a random face? I can't explain it, JUST LOOK AT MY PICTURE ATTACHED...

Service:
- All of the servers and hostess in the restaurant were young, not saying it's a bad or good thing but just observation.
- Not sure why there was so many people on the floor but half of the people weren't doing anything? They were walking around or simply standing in a corner talking to each other. Our server was literally taking care of at least 6 tables alone. Kudos to him.
- At one point, a girl came up to our table with the pepper and cheese and asked us if we wanted any for our meals, but we didn't even have any of our food yet.... What. The??
- There was a live DJ present, which was absolutely not needed in my opinion as they also had TVs showing sports.
- There was also at least 4 hostesses but I really don't see the point of having 4 hostesses. - The front entrance table could barely even fit all 4 of them.
- Lastly, a body guard was right at the entrance. A body guard?? If someone could kindly explain to me about why a body guard is needed, please do.
-- So so many question marks...

Ambiance
- I really didn't like the ambiance of Scaddabush... it was too loud from the music. I could barely even hear people from across the table speak.
- Scaddabush did however, provide plates on the table for us incase we wanted to share our meals!
- The glass water jug they provided also reminded me of my time at Montréal

With the inconsistency in food, service, decor and ambiance, I would probably not go back. Even though my dish was a 3.5/5 and I am intrigued to try the Lobster Pasta, this experience makes me not want to go back. I could probably go elsewhere to grab pasta with a better set of ambiance that I will enjoy.

PS: Happy World Pasta Day!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service. I love their pizza but I got the spaghetti this time. Not quite sure what the loaded meatball is because I didn't notice anything \"loaded\", but it was still very good."}
{"text":"I had a good time. The ambiance and vibe is definitely in touch with the nature of a downtown restaurant. The energy was vibrant and bustling. Service was nothing to complain about and our server was very friendly and talkative; he was charming and definitely knew how to take care of customers. My issue was with the food. It was edible but the price we were paying I would expect a lot better quality. We ordered the spaghetti and stuffed meatball. The consistency of the pasta decency, slightly passed al-dente, the sauce was mediocre and the meatball was overly dense and lack seasoning. We also had the pizza, the crust was good but the bottom was a bit soggy and undercooked for my taste (preference, I suppose). We also tried the charity bread that was so raved about but was gravely disappointed. It was over saturated with butter making the middle soggy and oily. We had to send that back. The server knew took care of that without hesitation. My dining compadres ordered a staggering amount of alcohol and from second hand testimonies, they would recommend the red sangria w/ ginger ale on the side. I wouldn't return on my own just mainly due to the price and forgettable dining experience, but it would be an easy option to book for business meetings during lunch time."}
{"text":"I went to Scaddabush on Friday night with two close friends for a late dinner get-together. As usual, they were busy so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but it was worth it. Eventually they took us in and seated us right near the back right beside the kitchen. It was an okay spot- the kitchen staff tends to be a little loud (it looked like they were having fun which is great) but sometimes it makes it difficult to have conversation. Our waiter took our drink orders and then left us with the menus for a bit. Unfortunately, I've had this waiter several times when I've been to this location, and he seems to be a little inattentive. For example, I ordered a drink with no ice, but he still brought it with ice. When we were finished eating, he also took about 20 minutes to come and clear away our plates. I understand they were busy but it seemed a little like he forgot about us.

On the food side, I have no complaints. We ordered the Naked Mozzarella (made in-house) as an appetizer and enjoyed every single bit, down to the last lick of the tomato jam. It was delicious as always. I ordered the Penne Bolognese as my main course and was pleased with how it tasted- no complaints and exactly what I expected. Their pasta (which is also made in-house) is absolutely delicious. My friends ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Shrimp Pasta and were happy with their choices as well. 

All in all, it was a nice evening, the service was near perfect, and the environment, as usual, was very comfortable with good music and a good mood created by the decor in the restaurant. I will definitely be back to this location!!"}
{"text":"I previously came here for a Yelp even many years ago and I remembered the food and service being great. This time around, it was mediocre. We had a large table since it was my sister's birthday so I think the server was having a challenging time juggling all the orders as they missed my sister and brother in-law's dishes and had to place the order again after they mentioned it. I ordered the meatball pasta. It was good but not great. The meatball didn't taste as good as the first time but the pasta was fresh as always. I like the fact that they had daily drink specials so we ordered their delicious mango passionfruit bellini for $6 on Thursday. Overall, this place is decent if you want a quick pasta fix."}
{"text":"What an unsuspecting gem! While my friend stayed at the hotel across the street we looked for a place to eat. Walking over to review the menu, without any expectations our group was so pleasantly surprised. 

The interior is cute and the wine list is decent. I also ordered a glass of the white sangria which was totally delish. 

We ordered the bruschetta and polenta fries as apps and I had the margherita pizza as my entree. I have to say the polenta fries were my fav. They were sooo tasty and I'd highly recommend trying them along along with this restaurant in general."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great decor, spacious seating, friendly staff. Definitely try their homemade meatballs and pizzas!"}
{"text":"Great place! Went on a Wednesday night with a coworker as we were in Toronto for work. Didnt know where to go for dinner so took it to yelp and thats how we ended up there. Overall its a great place. Awesome food, and great atmosphere. 

We got there at around 8:30pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table which was disappointing but were able to find spots at the bar and ordered some drinks. When our table was ready we got a text and got seated right away. 

Our waitress was amazing! Everything that she recommended was great and she even recommended other restaurants in the area for later in the week and things to do over the weekend. We had the prosciutto mozzarella which was amazing! Then I had the meatball with spaghetti which was the best meatball I've ever had!! My coworker had the butcher pizza which he said was really good and looked amazing. 

The portions are definitely generous. I had so much left but couldnt take it to go cause the hotel didnt have a fridge in the room. For dessert I had the zeppole which is like some doughnuts with a nutella like spread. It was delicious!

I took a star out because even thought our server was awesome we did have to wait quite a bit in between our meal and dessert and then for the check. It seemed like she was very busy. I definitely recommend this place if you are not in a hurry and are looking for something homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"We came tonight for the 50% off social club member special on spaghetti. The pasta pie was sold out, so the only two left were the shrimp pasta and meatball spaghetti. The meatball, you can choose between stuffed and not stuffed. We chose the stuffed meatball.

For my shrimp pasta, I find the pasta a bit rough and way too much lemon flavour, it tasted too sour and overpowered the entire dish.

The other meatball spaghetti, the spaghetti was way over cooked and turned out soggy. We send that dish back and they cooked us another one. The second round, the pasta improved a lot. 

Luckily I ordered my favourite  
Balsamic Truffle
$14.70
Drizzled with balsamic reduction, honey, truffle oil,
toasted hazelnuts, focaccia crostini

This dish, regardless of which location never disappoints me!"}
{"text":"Decor is cool. The serving staff is helpful but not completely honest in my quest for answers on food details. I was informed that their pasta is el dante, but she must have thought I wanted my pasta soggy. I asked about the quantity of lobster in the pasta, but I was never given an answer even though she said she needed to ask the kitchen. 

For the price of food charged I was disappointed. Fortunately I was with good company and that helped me through the evening. 

So, food stars are a 2. Server usefulness was a 2. Decor and ambiance is a 7, but I'm not there to subsidize the organization their monthly bank and rent payments. I'm there to help with their costs as long as I feel like I'm being properly fed (both good food and accurate information)."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and food! I'm from the US visiting on business. This was my first visit, and hopefully not my last. The burrata was the best I've had. If you love garlic, go for the bruschetta. It tastes as good as the pictures look. Lastly, don't leave without tasting the meatball. You don't need to get the stuffed one. The simple one was delicious and I've never been a meatball fan."}
{"text":"Such a bad experience! The staff made me feel uncomfortable as they were very hostile towards my friends and I. They treated us like prisoners for going to the washroom together and going inside to tell us we can't be in one stall together. First of all, why do you check out people in washrooms? My privacy was not respected at all and later on we got a \"warning\" because our behaviour was unacceptable. We were also accused of drinking in the bathroom and even of we had done so, the fact that they interfer our privacy is completely out of line and unprofessional. Furthermore, the music was way too loud and did not match the scenery at all for an \"Italian Restaurant.\""}
{"text":"So we came as a group of 10 for a friend birthday. It took our waitress 30 mins to take out drink out. Then another 20 for our food order. The food itself took forever to come out. We sat done for 830 pm and didn't get our food until 10 15pm. Service was terrible. Food was horrible and should not be consider Italian. If you are a true foodie you do not eat food here. It's pure Canadian style Italian. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone. Waste of time and money!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of Scaddabush the first time I tried it but I think I was just bitter about Fazooli's closing. Now that I've been here a couple more times, I am a fan! Their fresh mozzarella is like nothing I've ever tasted before especially paired with fig jam, prosciutto and sea salt. So far I've tried a few different pasta's (A+ for the 3 different sizes) but my ultimate favourite is the grilled cheese & prosciutto sandwich, which is basically the same as the appetizer I get - clearly I love my prosciutto & fig jam."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch or an early supper.  This trip I went on a Friday night.  It changes into a clubbier style bar only with fabulous food.  It is great for people watching.  

The spaghetti is awesome and don't miss the meatballs, stuffed if you like that sort of thing.  Order a skillet of their charity bread, you won't be disappointed and you help the local food bank.  Wash it all down with a San Pellegino and you can't miss.  Cheesecake is beyond wonderful and so are the Zeppole."}
{"text":"Service is okay. Server was friendly but didn't pay attention to specific requests.

 They are stingy with their toppings. I always get the vegetarian pasta at other locations and it was served with very little shrivelled arugula here...when I asked for more..(because it's a veggie pasta with literally only pasta, sauce and cheese) the expo server gave me attitude and said it's only only supposed to be a topping...no the menus says TOPPED with as in...it's on top...seriously, if there is no arugula it's basically plain pasta.... 

 Taste was okay. Not coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"It was my first Scaddabush visit ever, and I had a terrible experience. My pasta was not cooked and the service I had was terrible. 

I had friends who were seated first, and when I went in later I told the hostess at the front that I would like to look for my friends who I knew were seated. I looked to the left side of the restaurant first, looking around (as it's not the brightest lighting inside) and the hostess at the front gave me around 5 seconds to look around before abruptly stopping me and asking (not in the nicest way) if I was in the right restaurant (vs Jack Astors which is beside them). Then another hostess came by and knew exactly where my friends were. 

Their garlic bread was super super super oily, I felt like eating a sponge with oil. Not the greatest experience. My pasta was not cooked on the outskirts of the plate, but the center was okay. Which is not the way to serve food (having half of the food not cooked). Needless to say, I had very hard pasta for half of my meal. 

When it was time to get the bill, I waved to our server and she did not acknowledge me at all. She then proceeds to serve other tables, clean up other tables without looking up or around. I waited 10 minutes to flag her down to ask for the bill. She said she will get us the bill shortly. With that said, you would expect the bill to come rather quickly, as all they need to do is to print it out and bring a machine to you, right? But that was not the case at all. I waited another 15 minutes as I watched her clean up other tables and do other things before she finally got to bringing us the bill. And let me add, it was not a super busy hour. There was not a lot of tables filled. I truly believe they had enough servers for a much faster service. 

Overall, I would never go to this place again. The quality of the food is not worth the service you get."}
{"text":"That mozzarella..... is amazing!!! The honey truffle oil one is our favourite.
We always have a great experience whenever we go."}
{"text":"I am very pleased with my experience at Scaddabush (Italian slang for a little of this and a little of that).

Went for lunch, we made reservation for 11:45 a.m. I was greeted right away by the hostess.

Scaddabush is a beautiful restaurant. It certainly is a very inviting and cozy place to dine, exposed brick wall (YEAH!!), soft lighting and long communal tables have real candles! 

Our server was friendly and went over the menu as it was our first time dining at Scaddabush. Their mozzarella & pasta are made fresh daily, in-house! She recommended meatballs (took them years to perfect).

Two of us shared spaghetti and stuffed meatball and bianca pizza. Scaddabush offers Tuscan style long flat bread pizza. Pizza comes with pizza scissors, makes it easy to share.

The best part, after our food came, another server showed up with fresh parmesan cheese with a cheese grater and black pepper. Generous amount of cheese and pepper was sprinkled on our pasta and pizza. Basically she won't stop until you tell her to. Awesome! 

Meatball: we got the stuffed meatball (stuffed with mozzarella cheese)!! It was to die for! It's pretty big,~1/2 pound, made with angus beef, ricotta cheese and parsley and marinated with garlic, black pepper, porcini mushrooms and olive oil. The sauce has little bit of parmesan and pancetta for flavour and it's so damn good. It's probably the best meatballs I've ever had. Spaghetti was perfectly cooked al dante.

Bianca pizza has caramelized onions, roasted garlic and grape tomatoes, semi-sundried tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. The thin crust was cooked perfectly and there was generous amount of toppings. Very flavourful pizza. 

The portions were big, we were stuffed and unfortunately didn't have any room for dessert. 

Our water glasses were never empty.

Excellent food, awesome ambience, great service.. what more can you ask for? 
I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service is mediocre. Ambiance is loud but casual and comfortable. This is like a nicer East side Marios. Did not like my beverages, found them watery, and the wine list is... meh 
The food is Meh. The bathrooms are nice. 
This is a mediocre place. not much more to add to that, I feel like my parents would love it here, it's too... chain resto like for me."}
{"text":"Scaddabush never ceases to amaze me! Brought some friends here after an incredible first experience! 
We got the MUST HAVE mozzarella ball and it was amazing as always! Friends ordered the charity bread and it was so fresh and delicious! 
Our waitress was incredibly friendly and made the experience even better.
I had the Pesto Pollo Fettuccine and the flavours were incredible! A perfect dish with just the right amount of everything! 
My wife had Gluten Free Pomodoro pizza and said it was very spicy. Not like a typical mild sauce. Unfortunate, but atleast the Gluten Free crust was amazing! 
We showed up on a Saturday night around 7pm and had a 30 minute wait. They took my number and text me when the table was ready! Very convenient!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food! Found Scaddabush on YELP, but was unaware they made their own pasta in house fresh daily.  Also they stretch their own mozzarella daily between 5pm and 11pm.  Had the Pingue Prosciutto mozzarella which is a ball of fresh mozzarella, Focaccia crostini, fig jam, extra-virgin olive oil, sea salt on a wood plater. Delicious mix of flavors and options.  For a main I had the Pesto Pollo chicken.  Also very good.  Overall Scadddabush had excellent service and great food! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My new hometown hangout.

I was introduced to it through yelp and I've been back about 4 times since then... Hence why my reviews of other places have been diminishing. A girl can only eat so many times a day!

Things you must try once before you die:
1) Blood orange bellini. I'm a bellini snob and I used to collect all those plastic toys on top of Milestone bellinis until it made me seem like an alcoholic...
2) Fresh mozzarella - be warned, it's huge
3) Meatballs... Meatballs... Meatballs - and who doesn't like stuffed meatballs ;) Surely, not me!
4) Bruschetta - if you eat nothing else, eat this. HUGE portion.

I wasn't crazy about their pizzas. They lacked a moistness that I've come to expect from medium thin crust pizzas. It just wasn't juicy. Their calamari is very crisp but the batter drowns out the calamari taste...

I could so eat their meatball and spaghetti right now...

Buon Appetito!!!!

And go! Go now!! The place is huge with an outside patio (old Alice Fazoolis at square one).

And watch out for the unmatchy dishware. I mean they are scaddabush - a little bit of that and a little bit of this."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the spaghetti meat balls, they have a secret meat balls, made with certified Angus beef ground check with ricotta cheese and marinated with garlic, black pepper and porcine mushrooms. 


The Stella draft is awesome and the calamari is crispy and fresh. The service is amazing, responsive and swift."}
{"text":"I'm not sure but does home made pasta really taste doughy? 

I had the spaghetti and classic meat ball. The meatball was good (not amazing for a signature dish) but the spaghetti seemed very doughy and overcooked.

My wife had the pesto and it too seem overly doughy. It's like going to a hamburger joint and being fed a mcd burger...

Kids meals were Ok but when asked they preferred other places. 

Service was Ok.  I'd appreciate a refill on my water even though I know it's free. They serve it in chilled glass bottles so I'm sure the waiter knew it was empty. We waited so long for our bill that another server came by to clear our plates and then miraculously our waiter showed up to clear the last two.

Atmosphere was nice, would come again but only to see if it's me or if freshly  pasta is supposed to be doughy (then I'll complain)."}
{"text":"It is tucked away on Gerrard st despite its address being in yonge st.

The servers were wonderful and keep track of your rhythm. Our server made great suggestion for me to try the white sangria. The place is big but it still feels intimate. The place is famous for its freshly made mozzarella and gigantic meatball, which was great coz I was not hungry enough for a huge Italian main course. 

The kitchen is visible through a window and customers are welcome to view through a large window, specifically how the mozzarella is made. 

We had the naked mozzarella, which came with well buttered garlic bread that was just the right crunchiness. The mozzarella was warm and chewy. Very delicious.

We had the stuffed meatball, it was the size of a soft ball. The outside is slightly crispy. I don't eat meatball on a regular basis so it's a bit difficult for me to compare but I have to say that I only gave the last piece to my date to be polite.

My date also ordered some sort of pasta (i didnt pay attention to what it was because of the mozzarella) which I tried.  It was great as  well. 

Will definitely come back more frequently"}
{"text":"Upon entering this restaurant I was quite intrigued by it's distinguished vintage appearance, with the brick walls, dim lighting, and creative lighting fixtures. Our server Mark, offered exceptional service and was very friendly. I ordered the Capri (Fresh fettuccine, shrimp, scallops, PEI mussels, squid, roasted red peppers, scallions, lemon zest, tomato sauce) and told this dude I was not fond of mussels, so he said he would make sure they put in more of the other stuff. They kinda skimped on the squid, but I did get more then enough scallops. I felt like the tomato sauce could have been more hearty, but hey that's just me. I like a more richer and chunkier tomato sauce. Added some parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper. The Charity bread is soooo good. It's a light and spongy garlic bread that is really flavorful. Trust me, get out that spearmint afterwards. I would visit this place again, to try some other dishes. May just end up giving them 5 stars next time around, but they'd have to really impress me. The Charity bread really did it up."}
{"text":"Usually have a good experience at scaddabush but this time was terrible. Waited 20 minutes for a table for 2, turns out they \"forgot\" about us. We had no designated waiter, couldn't order, not even water for the table. Even asking for the bill took 10 minutes. Food is ok, service was not good."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. Having been here a few times now, Scaddabush has proven itself to be a solid choice. Reasonable prices, good portions and I dig the trendy yet casual vibe. Perfect for a date, girls night out or a dinner with friends.

I came here with my boyfriend recently after joining their Social Club and received a $25 off $50 coupon. We were also notified of a members-only appetizer called the Fettuccine Fritta which we ordered along with the Naked Mozarella to start. 

Fettuccine Fritta (fried papparadelle pasta, mozarella, tomato sauce, bruschetta) was surprisingly delicious. True to the description, it was literally bruschetta, nachos and pasta in one. If you're a fan of any one of those things, you'd love this. My boyfriend avoids anything with tomato sauce but he couldn't stop munching on it!

Naked Mozarella is a must try as it's made daily in-house. Served on a wood platter with bread, salt and fig jam. A very nice mix of flavors and great presentation.

Onto the mains. Everytime I come here, I always order my favorite, the Baked Carbonara. The parmesan cream sauce is nice and rich but not overwhelming. The poached egg really takes it to another level. So so good. ALSO: Unlike the other pasta dishes on their menu, this one only comes in a single size).

Lastly, we ordered the Smoked Bacon and Egg pizza. A lot spicier than I thought. Although I guess I should've expected it since the description had chilies and chili oil. It was good but I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I wanted to because of my unfortunate  low tolerance for spicy food. The egg yolk really helps fight the heat though. So break the yolk and spread it evenly on the pizza if you're struggling!

Bill came out to about $40 after tax and tip which is quite a steal. We were stuffed and had leftovers to take home. I believe the 25 off 50 is over but they still have the regular 10 off 30 if you sign up, so do take advantage. 

Service could be improved as I found our waitress to be a bit awkward and rather unengaging but no complaints otherwise!"}
{"text":"For a very long time I looked straight past Scaddabush because of a few key reasons:
- the fact that it's a chain
- its close proximity to unremarkable establishments such as Reds and Elephant Castle and the non foodie part of town aka Yonge and Dundas

I'm sorry I judged you Scaddabush because I could not have been more wrong!

A few things aligned that led to me trying this place. Firstly I caught wind of a recently held event here where everyone raved about the food. Secondly my friend who was visiting me in Toronto wanted a restaurant with a good vibe for her last night in town...a Monday. I thought to myself, well Scaddabush is always pretty full and open late so they must have a little something something going on on a Monday night. I was right...and I've since been back at least six times in recent months.

Things to like:
- they make their own pasta and mozzarella daily and have signs up telling you who the craftsman/craftswoman was
- professional and friendly hostesses and servers who treat you well regardless of whether you have a reservation or not
- the staff seem happy to work there, are attentive and I find I can always have a joke with them
- great vibe, tunes, noise level and lighting (the right amount of dark)
-  a nice big space with multiple floors
- a very consistent experience with regards to food quality and service
- a lot of variety for vegetarians and innovative menu options e.g. meal companions (sides) and the *cheap pours* aka discounted wine carafes

What I like:
- the burrata mozzarella
- the bruschetta (so many options)
- the red *cheap pours*
- the arrabiatta pasta (but be warned it has a slow burn spiciness)
- the polenta tots
- the charity bread

Definitely give this place a go. I think it would be a great place for a first date or a larger group dinner."}
{"text":"Fave restaurant to date! 
Love the food, atmosphere and staff!
Kids meals are fantastic! Portions are great and a fun dessert option. We hope to see new items added to the menu- since we are regulars and would love to see some more options! 
We love the cheese made in house and gluten free options are very important to our family! Unfortunately no real gluten free DESSERT options.... HOPEFULLY SOON 
Also have a great wine list!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Oh the ambiance and dishes are exquisite to beyond in comparison to eateries of the same market segment. 

I enjoy the pizza greatly.
There is often a DJ sassing the joint up. 
Music is contemporary and fun for a snazzy night.

If you take a date that isn't impressed, and you are, question that relationship.
That's all for now."}
{"text":"We went last sunday to check it out. The food was fresh and delicious! We ordered the chicken parmesan bites to start, a chicken parmesan sandwich with rosemary garlic fries and the beet and goat cheese salad.  I did not like the pickled veggies on the sandwich so I picked them off. It is not a chain (yet) but likely will be from what our server told us! We will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Are you swiping on tinder and you finally found the perfect match to take out but don't know where to take her. Look no more. 
Nice dim lit place which sets all the right moods. Food is affordable so you don't feel so bad paying for her on the first date. But I must say make sure to have a reservation because this place gets awfully busy and you don't want to look like that guy who goes to the restaurant and find out it's an hour wait but then she is really hungry so you have to think quick on your feet and find a restaurant close by which you might end up going to canyon creek which is crazy expensive and once you see the bill you'll shed a single tear. 

Yeah. 

Great place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place to hangout. I ordered the gnocchi and shared smoked bacon & egg pizza as well as other pastas with my friends. The portions were big even for small sizes. The gnocchi was rich but a bit too heavy to finish all by myself, but it was all good since we share the dishes. Really good value over all."}
{"text":"The thing about scaddabush is that you enter and are immediately expecting a great night - the decor, personable hostesses, vibe, even price points are all great. The issue with this place comes with the service -- which is slow, slow, slow. Ive been here twice in the last two weeks and both times the service is less than desirable. Which is hard to understand as there are a plethora of servers working the floor."}
{"text":"Exceptionally fresh food.   Salad greens had a sweet balsamic dressing that was delicious.   Greens themselves tasted as if they gad just been picked.

\"Meatball\" and spaghetti were flavourful.   Fresh pasta with home made red sauce.  Meatball was seasoned just right and incredibly tender.

This was our first time to this restaurant and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this restaurant as the menu looked fabulous. Showed up at about 7pm and there were many visibly open tables. A couple people waiting in line. Was told that it would be a 20 minute wait for our group, no big deal. 45 minutes later, still waiting. Go ask the host desk, they say 15 more minutes. Still many visibly open tables. 30 minutes later go ask again, they say they are booked with reservations and it will be a while longer. I ask why it was not disclosed that they were solid with reservations for the night when I first came in 1hr15min ago? No answer. All of a sudden he says our table is ready.
Waitress was excellent.
Food was very good except for 1 meal which came out cold. Was immediately corrected though.
Would not return."}
{"text":"To start this review off - I have no idea if this will be a 3 star or a 4 star review, so I'm just gonna write out my thoughts and see where this takes me.

This was my first dinner venture by my lonesome to a \"Caucasian\" restaurant while I'm not travelling, but I'd figure that why not be daring lol. Anywho, here's what I ordered:

Osso Bucco Bites - these were amazing! They were like a Chinese version of salt and pepper ribs but glazed in chili honey with a hint of Grana Padano cheese.  They had a small salty flavour covered in sweet honey with a bit of kick.  While the presentation wasn't the best, it was quite meaty and I really enjoyed it.  

Meatball with spaghetti - that's right. Meatball - just one.  By the way, I'm not a fan of tomato sauce, but I had to venture out to try the meatball because that's their signature item. I was recently at a Jack Astors and had something similar and hated it at Jack Astors (the meatball was too soft - felt microwaved and pasta tasted like Chef Boyardee).  However, the meatball here was tender (not soggy), and you could tell how fresh all the beef was.  It was decent, but what I really enjoyed was the spaghetti.  I think the spaghetti was some kind of multi-grain or something, but oh man, it was good.  It had a nice crispness to it, such that you could bite a strand and break it apart.  I haven't spaghetti that good since my mom used to make it from scratch.  They also served fresh mozzarella with it.  AMAZING.  

So I guess for food 5/5.  

Service:  I'm not sure if it was because I was by myself and never realize how long food takes at these type of restaurants, but it took about 40 minutes from the app to the main.  The app came out fairly quickly, about 10 minutes, but then I didn't my main until 30 minutes later.  Not sure if this is standard at these type of restaurants, but I wonder how they can serve someone at lunch when they only a 1 hour break?  Also, while my waitress was really nice, I swear she was blind!!! She was looking at my table directly about 7-8 times and I waved my arm ever so gently to get her attention to get the bill.  After the 8th time, I finally got her attention to get the bill.  She seemed to be helping everyone else, so maybe she was the head of the waitstaff? Not sure.  However, overall, I'd give the service a 3/5 (I would have given it a 4 - but waving 8 times to get the bill!!!)


Atmosphere: Same as any Jack Astor, Alice Fazooli's, etc.  3/5

So what does this average out to? 3.67/5 lol.  I guess I have to round up. 

Oh yeah - price - about $20-$25 excluding drinks."}
{"text":"I was curious to try Scaddabush based on all the Yelp reviews and there were some high notes but ultimately, the mains were pretty average.

Food: The meal started off with a bang.  We started with Mozzarella (Buratta) which was fantastic.  The Buratta is \"infused with honey and truffle cream.\"  Neither the honey nor truffle cream were particularly pronounced but it didn't matter, it tasted great! There were generous portions of cheese too.  

Next came the meatball which was really great and was absolutely the highlight of the meal.  It was perfectly textured both inside and outside.  The centre was quite moist and not crumbly or dry at all.  The seasoning was great too. 

Next came the mains.  I was debating whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars because the main meal itself was disappointing.  I was looking forward to the pastas the most because of the homemade noodles and because the appetizers were fantastic.  We ordered the Capri and Bolognese.  First off, the fettuccine noodles in both cases were quite soft; I really like my noodles al dente, or at the very least, a bit chewy.  Second, the Bolognese tasted fairly generic as far as meat sauces go.  It was neither rich nor meaty.  The Capri itself wasn't too bad.  There were generous servings of PEI muscles.  Scallops were small and there weren't many pieces of squid though.  Flavouring was OK but lacked any significant punch.  Portion sizes were pretty good 

Service: waiter was nice and attentive but the meals took a while to arrive.  We waited about 30 minutes for the main course which isn't terrible, but also not great either.

As far as the restaurant is concerned, It can get pretty loud in here.  There's a DJ at least on the evening we went blaring various pop songs.  The hipster lightbulbs are also present here.  There's a patio outside as well.  My suggestion would be to make a reservation and as a tip, if OpenTable is full, give them a call and they can usually squeeze you in.

Overall:
Mozzarella Buratta: A-
Meatball: A+
Capri: B-
Bolognese: C+
Bathrooms: A+
Service: B
Ambiance: Loud

With a bottle of wine, appetizers, meals, tax and tip, the total was about $140.

Bottom Line: Scaddabush really hits a lot of high notes; the apps are great and it's nice to go to an unpretentious Italian restaurant with decent prices.  There really is a case to be made for restaurants that fill the void between East Side Marios and Buca and I think this restaurant can fill that void.  If it weren't for the disappointing mains, it would have been perfect.  It can get quite loud here, so I'd avoid this place if you want an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"We were part of a large group here for a birthday party on a Sunday evening. We really enjoyed our night at this location - the meal was fairly priced, tasted delicious, and part of an awesome atmosphere. Between two people, with an appetizer, main meal, and drinks, you could expect to spend around $40-$50.

First, the service. Our server Ceasar was friendly, quick, and belted out an awesome rendition of Happy Birthday. He was absolutely awesome, and I'd like to commend him for the great service we received that night.

Second, the food. We shared platters and ordered the rosemary garlic fries, spinach dip, fried calamari, and pesto pollo. I've also ordered, during a past visit, the crispy polenta fries and the chicken avocado BLT. The rosemary garlic fries are a personal favourite, but I'd recommend any of these dishes. The food is delicious, tastes fresh, and the portion sizes are satisfactory. Overall, I'd recommend this place for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I love the Ceasar salad here because it is so  garlicky!  They have toned down the garlic and have made the dressing more liquid, so it now feels lightly dressed.  However, the salad is still a win for me.  Their meatballs are so-so as well as the hamburger."}
{"text":"Not coming back.
Seafood in my pasta (Fettuccine pasta) was undercooked, returned the plate to the kitchen and they brought the same pasta just warmer. Not to mention they forgot to put salt on it!! Didn't even eat half of the plate, I must say it was a really bad experience.
Dessert was not tasty either, it was one of the spring specials. You could tell it was not fresh so the cake was really dry.
Do not recommend any person coming to this restaurant when they are so many better options around the city!"}
{"text":"Nice location/ setting. Pasta and Pizza I ordered was tasty and fresh. Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"3.5
great atnosphere, friendly staff. its like a nice upscale feeling patio and the decor was thoughtfully planned.  even the bathrooms are beautiful.  conceptually i think the place is bang on.  food wise my group of friends only ordered aperizers and bèer.  primarily the proscuitto board wt cheese as well as calamari.  those two aps alone were a 3.5/5 didnt have that refined nor elegant execution the bread was too oily.  calamari was average ive had better.
i think the real test is the italian food... the pasta which we didnt try so hard to judge overall.

happy experiemce none the less and would def come back to try the main dishes"}
{"text":"Good food, excellent selection, big portions (if I had a do-over, I'd buy less and share more).    Fun spot, lively environment"}
{"text":"I wasn't 100% happy with the service here. The waiter was incredibly slow, which resulted in a 45-50mins wait for appetizers. Dinner was lasted nearly 3hrs. We had to ask for more water for the table. We came here for an Anniversary dinner for my parents. When we booked reservations, we asked for a cheesecake to be bought to the table after dinner. When we arrived, we confirmed that. When the time came, they bought us a chocolate brownie cup. Like why and how? And it was apparently too late to change it. 

Food was good though, not great, but it was good enough for me to come back again."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to SCADDABUSH at the Yelp Elite Crawl; since it was good times, I had to come back! 

Came here on a Wednesday night. It was packed so we had to leave our number and kill time before a table was available (not too bad considering Duke's Refresher Bar is right next door). I love the ambiance here; it's super casual with a great selection of beverages and food. Portions are quite generous here so just order a few plates and share it with your dining companions. As others have mentioned, SIKB is a great place should you be in a group. They have a lot of large tables that can accommodate big numbers. The location is very convenient as well; you're about a block south of College Station. I found service to be excellent ... even the Manager does his rounds and introduces himself to everyone. For drinks, I would recommend the blood orange mojito. As for food, we ordered mozzarella (only available in the evenings & it comes with crostini, jam, and prosciutto), pizza (comes on a long board and you get cool scissors to cut up pieces), and the regular meatball (it's a little salty for my liking).

Anyway, can't wait to return. I really enjoyed my second time at SCADDABUSH.

Good for: Italian, drinks, groups"}
{"text":"Went to Scarborough location. Burnt garlic. Fake Italian food. Loud club music. Do not recommend to anyone with a taste bud or self respect. The Sunday sauce was not. The pizzas are not. The carbonara was oven bake. WTF. And to insult Carbonara even more it was served on Penne!  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant people. Not a club. Will not return. Too loud to carry on a conversation. Italian mothers are discussed.  Doesn't matter how good the food is if the waitress can't even hear you."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and his relatives that were in town. I would say this place is average. The location is very convenient as it was near the Yonge and College subway station. When I entered into the restaurant the hostesses were very friendly and helpful. In general the service at this place was good, our server was very friendly and attentive (attentive meaning, the server was attentive to our needs and wasn't overbearing). The food on the other hand, I thought was average for a restaurant of similar caliber. We ordered two sociable size pastas and the charity bread as the appetizer. I didn't care much for the charity bread, it was too hard and a bit salty. As for the pasta, we ordered one chicken pesto, which I liked, the flavors were good. However, the other pasta that we ordered, which was a seafood marina sauce pasta, I thought the flavors were bland.   

I would say this is a good place for a nice casual dinner with friends. But the dinning room that evening was rather loud, so I did have a hard time listening to the conversation that was going on at our table. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here; my first time was for their 2015 Winterlicious menu (I thought it was okay, but good enough to warrant trying their actual menu). Scaddabush is a very trendy, spacious restaurant with a variety of different table types: patio, low tables, high tables, booths, and bar. This would make a great date spot, since they have some intimate booths with atmospheric lighting (interestingly, half the restaurant was relatively brightly lit, while the other half was dark - you have your choice). 

Tonight, I had the Pomodoro pizza (thin crust, diced, seasoned tomatoes on a red pizza) with a side caesar salad ($13.95; $2.95). The pizza was great; there were ample toppings, the crust was both crisp and chewy, and the pizza cutter was wayyyyy awesome (and super functional). The salad was average; not overdressed, but the croutons (3) tasted stale. 

My friends ordered the pasta carbonara, and the chicken parmesan sandwich. Although the portions looked a bit small, the dishes were rich and filling. I thought my pizza was a very reasonable portion size (boyyy I was stuffed). 

Service was quick to average, and the waitress didn't hesitate to split the bill for us (party of 3)."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scarborough location plenty of times but it was my first time at this downtown location. The food and service surely did not disappoint. I love how they have an upstairs and the bar area is poppin'. 

I usually get the shrimp spaghetti to eat every single time because it's just that's good, but I decided to try something new since I was at a new location. I got the ravioli in a small which didn't even begin to fill me but was still delicious. I think I'll stick to my regular for future occasions. 

I'd come back to this location."}
{"text":"This time I got the zucchini fritti as an appetizer and it was honestly one of the best appetizers of ever had! It's basically deep fried slices of zucchini with a tomato sauce as a dip which was so tasty I don't even know how to describe it. I'm typically a clean eater and eating deep-fried stuff makes my stomach all gross but the batter on the zucchini wasn't coated on thick, it was just perfect. I'll definitely order this again next time I come back."}
{"text":"Excellent italian restaurant. The menu is pretty diverse and doesn't shy away from fresh ingredients. The prosciutto mozzarella and burrata is just to die for! Their avocado bruschetta is also amazing, with a nice crunchy element that balances well with the avocado. 

I'd also definitely recommend getting their mascarpone cheesecake. Freshly made in house and topped with their homemade whipped cream and berry compote. 

Service was great and friendly. The approach didn't feel scripted at all and felt very genuine. 

This was place was a great find and I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love their fettuccine Capri! Delicious and home made pasta is always a plus. The place is big and bustling. Atmosphere is fantastic. They have a lot of choices on their menu as well. No reservations for Friday nights though. Great for big groups/parties. I'll definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The mozzarella is TO DIE FOR!! We went in for a late lunch, and our waiter was able to offer it to us even though it was 3pm, and they only serve it after 5pm. It was the highlight of the meal. :)

The waiter also recommended the spaghetti and stuffed meatball, and we were not disappointed. The meatball was like silk!!

We also ordered the pizza Sophia which was more like a flatbread thing, but not bad. The lovely service more than made up for the so-so pizza. 

Would definitely come back... I was eyeing their osso bucco bites... next time!"}
{"text":"This is a gem in Scarborough. The staff are very nice. There is never a point where we're waiting long for the bill, a napkin or water(trust me I come here a lot) 

What I've tried & loved: pesto pollo fettuccine (probably my favourite thing on the menu), baked penne carbonara (because who doesn't like Parmesan pasta with poached egg on top AND BACON!!!), Americano pizza, Sophia pizza, chicken Parmesan sandwich (if you're here for lunch - definitely get this). 

And the sociables (smaller dishes) that I loved include: ofcourse the calamari and the zucchini fritti. 

If you're trying to be healthy I suggest the tuscan salad with salmon on the side (I even get this for take out that's how much I love it)."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a dinner with some peeps and we noticed the menu had two items that were missing which were favourites of ours.  The fresh burrata combo is no longer available from fresh made mozza menu while the lobster spaghetti has entirely disappeared from the pasta section.  I think they replaced the lobster spaghetti with a shrimp spaghetti dish which isn't the same. :-S

This was a bit of a disappointment but we made due and still had a good time there.

The upstairs is much brighter than the downstairs which I prefer but I really have to question the fact that they sat us at a table in front of the storage room or employee access room.  Throughout the dinner, there were people going in and out of the room and they had to be careful opening the door because it could hit the person sitting closest door.  Why have a table there in the first place?

The negroni I ordered was quite tasty and I liked that it was a bit on the sweeter side.  Thanks to that extra dab of sweet vermouth. :-)

I browsed the menu and settled to have the Italian burger and opted for the garlic rosemary fries.  The burger was slightly pink in the middle which was fantastic.  The patty was the right tenderness and the burger toppings were a good compliment.

We had a nice chat with the manager near the end of the meal and again lamented the fact that the burrata and lobster spaghetti were off the menu.  Nothing they could do about it but maybe with enough feedback, they can bring it back! :-)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once at 10pm with a group of friends and once at 12pm with coworkers/managers, and both were fantastic experiences! Lunch or dinner - I highly recommend coming to Scadda for a really delicious meal. I'm not sure what their parking situation is, but it's a 5 minute walk from Dundas Station. There's also free wifi in their restaurants. This restaurant is 2 floors, and around 10 or 11 at night, the bar downstairs will play fantastic 90s throwback music!

Favourite food to order:
All proceeds from their charity bread goes to one of three local charities that they partner with (Sick Kids, Mississauga Food Bank, Starlight Canada). Charity bread starts at $4.47 and goes up depending on what type you get. My favourite thing to order whenever I'm at Scadda is their naked fresh mozzarella ($13.28), but fresh mozzarella is unfortunately only available after 5pm. Their spinach and artichoke dip ($12.98) and bruschetta ($6.77-small and $10.97-large) is something I would order for a part of 2 or 3 because their portions aren't that big. I didn't try their stuffed meatball ($13.58), but my boyfriend tried it and it is one HUGE meatball.

I have tried their chicken parmesan ($19.98) which is very, very, very filling because of all the pasta. My go-to entree here is their pizza - specifically the Sophia ($16.87). It comes with chicken, goat cheese, and caramelized onions - my favourite 3 ingredients for pizza! After 1 or 2 starters, I usually am full enough to take home some leftovers from my main.

Service is not bad, but nothing very memorable. My friend decided to host her birthday dinner here for about 12 people. She said that the staff member she talked to when making her reservation tried to get her to use a price fixe menu for this dinner multiple times, but she kept refusing because she knew it would cost more per person."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was horrible. We had the calamari which was actually really good and then I also had the veggie sandwich was was amazing. The drinks here were very weak, but I feel like that is the trend in Canada as I am from the US"}
{"text":"Not really a fan of chain resturants but I loved Scaddabush!!  In fact I've made two excuses to go back for their mozzarella  ball in the last month lol.  

Osco Bosco (?sp) bites are also amazing."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was amazing! The spaghetti was great, meat balls so so.  Highly recommend the mozzarella cheese Classico to share!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious with a reservation, when we arrived we got seated quickly. Our waitress was very nice and didn't mind us taking awhile on ordering because we were waiting for our friend to arrive. She came by and checked up on us to make sure we had water and more drinks if needed. When we did order, I (and 3 others) got the goat cheese and avocado brushchetta appetizer, chicken limone for main, and tiramisu for dessert. Bf ordered the calamari, bolognese penne, and chocolate gelato. The standouts for me were the calamari, and the tiramisu. I have to say for the entree choices for their Winterlicious menu really didn't help them shine. I found my chicken good and moist however it was not very special. My bf's penne was good but also okay. I wish they had showcased their freshly made pasta a bit better with a better choice of pasta dish OR showcased their strongest dishes over their subpar dishes. It was overall a good dining experience and will probably go back."}
{"text":"I came here for a work dinner and later came back for another visit because I enjoyed the food and service so much!
As far as restaurants in Scarborough goes, this is one of the few I really enjoy.
Prices are reasonable compared to other Italian restaurants I've been to however can still get pricey depending on what you order.

I suggest skipping their pizza, it's not going to be the traditional Italian style. I found the crust not very tasty and it didn't wow me. I would rather save pizza cravings for another time.
Instead I found their pasta and mozzarella the highlight of each visit.  I fell in love and I mean IN LOVE with their butternut squash ravioli.
I crave it. I am usually not a huge pasta fan but that dish is one of my top favourites. Their fresh mozzarella is very good-the truffle oil with honey is my favourite over the meat sausage one. Make sure you take a seat at the bar in the back to watch them make it.

Don't load up on too much bread (they don't serve you bread while you're waiting) but in case you decide to order some, their garlic bread is heavy and looks very filling.
They make good drinks too!

We found the service great each time we've gone, we had a awesome waiter. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"We had the most perfect leisurely early dinner tonight! We started with their 3-cheese charity bread and calamari, both of which were really good. We also shared a bottle of Pinot Grigio which was straight from the vineyard (i.e. not available at the LCBO). For our mains, I had the spaghetti and giant meatball (I had ordered it stuffed with cheese but when it arrived as plain, they immediately brought me a stuffed one). My friends had the penne carbonara and the shrimp spaghetti. Both of those mains looked really amazing. For dessert, we had a new selection which was called something like a chocolate bomba which we shared. It was perfect! Lots of chocolate sauce on the plate which we soaked up using the sponge cake! Our server, Elyse, was really friendly and nice, attentive and prompt. 
a note: I have visited this Scaddabush location on two separate occasions but not since at year ago if not more. I was so glad to return tonight! I haven't had a bad experience any time. The next time, I will try to make room for the mozzarella with tomato jam."}
{"text":"I have passed by this establishment a number of times to go to Duke's. My friend suggested that we finally go in and try their Italian repast. 

Our server was awesome! He provided us with suggestions and was understanding of our indecisiveness. He was also engaging, but as we were here for a while, he didn't interrupt our conversation excessively to ask if we were okay. He came by just enough times to enable us to get additional drinks or dishes.

My friend got the stuffed meatball and garlic bread, which she loved. I got the Capri pasta and the calamari. The calamari and accompanying sauce was standard. The Capri pasta was uninspired and under-delivered.

According to the menu, the Capri pasta contains, mussels, squid, shrimp, scallops, roasted red peppers, scallions, lemon zest, and tomato sauce. The flavour was basic and there was one ring of squid, no scallops and no shrimp. There was however, at least eight cloves of garlic.

Normally I would have said something, but I was caught up in conversation with my friend and the abundance of mussels (which i love) distracted me I suppose. I regret not mentioning anything, but once I had realized, I had eaten more than half of the portion... I didn't want to be that guy :(. So there I was... disappointed, smelling like a garlic clove."}
{"text":"Went there twice...

First time, it was wintertime, we were seated in the well lit lounge area with a nice view toward the patio... We enjoyed a nice glass of wine with a delicious Italian style pizza...

2nd time, we just wanted to have an appetizer with a drink... We didn't find anything that is interesting in the appetizer menu, do we just had our drinks and left...

Service was ok on both times..."}
{"text":"First things first. Get here early if you planning on eating at 6ish on a Saturday. Very, very hard to get parking. We got a table right away (only 3 of us). Took 14 min til a waiter came for our drink order and he was surprised we did not see our waitress yet.

Ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and charity classic bread as apps. Very good I thought. Mains were the speghetti and meat ball, and the chicken avocado blt with a mixed salad. The speghetti I thought was under cooked and tasted a bit like Chef boyardee. The meat ball was a half pound and reminded me of tomato soup for am odd reason. My sandwich was real good and loved my Salad.

I might come back but not likely anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 14.  They spilled meatballs all over the end of the table - getting Marinara sauce all over my purse, my compatriots computer bag and sample bag (had to give us paper bags for the sample bag as unrecoverable.    Their solution. Was to offer dry cleaning - no free drinks or comp the meatballs

Then even better ready to pay but can't find our waitress as she is sitting with her friends relaxing and they charge a 17% gratuity for spilling food on its.  Can't expressive disappointment over the abysmal service.   

Sorry.  But can't recomments"}
{"text":"Dinner for three started out great.  A wonderful venue, open kitchen, quickly seated, and the food sounded good, but their timing was off, not once, but throughout the meal.  First, the wine was delayed.  Second, as we were enjoying our appetizers (not  1/2 done) of a wonderful meatball, naked mozzarella, and delicious bread along come the entrees.  I sent them back - there was no room for them on the table and secondly we were not going to rush. Then when ready, they came out again and clearly not the same items, but freshly prepared pastas Arrabiata, Bolognese and a Capri Salad - all delicious.  Next we order dessert, and wait, and wait, and wait.  Finally, I say forget it, just the bill.  Well, I am told we are just plating them.  I explain we've finished our coffee and need to move on.  At which point the manager arrives and offers us the desserts for free.  I decline because at that point we do not want them.  She was very gracious and offered to make it up to us.  The food was quite good.  The atmo was nice - although initially a bit loud with a raucous party nearby, but after they left, much better on that front. But, I cannot ignore the whole event and just speak to the food when rating them.  They need to work on their timing.  The practice of having multiple players look after you, may be efficient (wait staff, runners, etc.), but it really didn't work this time."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with work friends as we celebrated a birthday. They have an extensive menu of appetizers like their fresh mozzarella made to order, homemade stuffed meatball, and delicious pizzas and pastas. 

The last time I went to Scaddabush we ordered an avocado and goat cheese bruschetta to share. The creaminess of the cheese and avocado nicely contrasted with the crunchiness of the bread. We also ordered a meatball stuffed with pepperoni and cheese, which had some tasty garlic chips adorning the dish. The meat was still moist and there was serving was enough for 3 of us to share. 

I had been eyeing the zucca pasta (large serving $19.97) since first laying eyes on the menu. It is a butternut squash ravioli with a hazelnut butter cream sauce and fried sage. This dish was so satisfying that I ate a large portion by myself.

Was a bit disappointed that even though we told the waiter in advance that we had coupons after signing up for their Social Club that would give us $10 off an order of $30, we were not told until it was time to pay the bill that only one coupon can be redeemed per table. Despite this lack of transparency in the part of our server, the food was delicious and we plan to come back to try some of Scaddabush's other menu offerings.

(39/100)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Great service and even better food. It was the best chicken parm I have had. It's a casual atmosphere with 2 outdoor patios. We also had the cappatavi which was also good."}
{"text":"This is the brand spankin' new place opened where Alice Fazooli's used to be at Square One, and what a change! 

We walked in, and were greeted (ambushed) by what looked like 15 hosts, and they all were telling us different things about the place..the fresh mozzarella, the fresh pasta, etc etc. It was a bit overwhelming at first..but we got used to it. Everyone at this place is suuuuper suuuuuper positive. 

The decor was pretty nice. Kinda new age/hipstery with all the mannequins and stuff on the walls, and the 70's style high top chairs. 

We mostly went there for drinks, so lemme list what we had:

1. The White Sangria - was DELICIOUS. A little sour, but like candy sour. We all loved it. 

2. The Peach Mango Bellini - YUM. Tasted like pure fruit puree. Felt like there was no alcohol though. Lolz. 

3. Various shots - nothing to review about that.

Then we got hungry, so we got some noms:

1. The Atomica Pizza : SO GOOD. My favourite pizza I've ever had @ a restaurant I think. Spicy Sausage, lots of peppers, and fresh mozzarella. So good. It came with these pizza scissors, WHICH BASICALLY FREAKING MADE MY LIFE. I wanted to steal them so badly.

2. The Charity Bread : Its actually pretty cool. It;s this little rosemary/garlic loaf, and its only 2 dollars, but all proceeds go to like a food bank or something. We ended up getting like 3 or 4 of them. Defo must get.

3. The Spaduch : This was like little mozzarella sandwiches on skewers? And they were doused in this lemony caper sauce. The mozz was amazing. I wasn't really a fan of the sauce because it went a little too hard on the capers. but it was different.

4. The Rosemary Garlic Fries : FANTASTIC. MUST GET. Really well seasoned! 


Final Notes:

I really liked this place, and will definitely go back. The prices aren't expensive, so it's definitely worth your dollars, Think 20 - 30 per person sans drinks. 

The patio LOOKS AFREAKINGMAZING. Too bad it was pouring out there when we went, otherwise we defo would have spent 99% of our time there.

MUST GO."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service, the food lacked salt and pepper and the server never bothered to ask if we were okay. Butter bush squash ravioli was so greasy I was about to vomit all night afterwards"}
{"text":"meh. Due to awesome reviews and the convenient location, I had to check it out on friday evening. I had atomica pizza and meatball with spaghetti. Neither was truly amazing. There are better italian places in town, probably won't come again.

p.s Lots of dust eating along the side of the busiest street in Toronto... just saying."}
{"text":"Their fresh mozzarella is a signature thing for a reason. My friends and I ordered the \"Naked\" and split it among the three of us. There definitely was not enough, it was so good!

I ordered the Capri pasta and a regular size was a nice, big portion. The pasta was super delicious too and you can taste the difference when it is made in-house. The Orange sangria was good but the pitcher was a bit small for $27, in my opinion.

Our server, Brittany, was great as well. The only thing that night was that our dessert order got put in late in the kitchen so it took a while for it come out, however, I knew firsthand that it was super busy that night. 

I'd come back for the mozzarella alone!"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was subpar. When it arrived to my table, the pizza appeared to be burnt and my dip was just a little to watered down. I like the interior of the place but I'm not so sure I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Yes please!  A great lunch spot, and I am sure just as good for dinner. Trendy and cool place to hang out.  Pricing: as you would expect.   Recommended"}
{"text":"Quality of good is as good as the one on Front street but less crowded and no wait time to be seated.

Attentive service. Their apple cinnamon cold pressed drink  and the in house truffle mozzarella with balsamic vinegar is a must order! Delicious!

I would recommend you to order pizza instead of their pasta due to their portion. Their pasta are all homemade but portion wise is too little for the same price as the pizza."}
{"text":"This review is for the new Scarborough location, from July 2016 (delayed review, sorry!).

Beautiful patio - not as beautiful as Mississauga, but better than Toronto downtown!

Very nice ambiance. Service could be better (faster), but there are good choices for food and drinks. This is a great date spot, or if you're having a birthday dinner, etc. Its a little upscale (so expect pricier options) so its perfect for a special occasion.

The inside decor is just as beautiful, so I would love to come again during the winter!

Food: mozzarella ball to start (very good, but they were super delayed in bringing us extra bread), crusted snapper (really good), and meatball sandwich (delicious!!!). Everything was really tasty, but rich and carb-y (sides of bread, fries, and potatoes). 

Drinks: There's a variety of good options. I had one drink that I really didn't like but of course I don't remember the name. Just saying that not everything is good. 

I'd definitely come here again if I'm looking for something a bit fancier and trendy in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Excellent place on yong and gerrad! We had the following items:
1) Charity Bread - which supports a local charity,
2) Pesto Polo Pasta - was delicious (Alfredo sauce was yummy), 
3) Meatballs on top of fresh spaghetti (also was yummy!)

Atmosphere, was great. Good vibe in the place on a Friday night and the drink options were worth it. We shared a pitcher of Sangaria which was worth it. 

The patio was open as well, but we opted to sit inside. 

I would highly recommend this place and be returning someday. 

Great experience! Thanks for a welcoming time."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect of Scaddabush and have always thought of it as just another Italian chain (I was thinking East Side Mario's) prior to going but I'm so glad I did, because the food was amazing!

The lighting was a tad dark and almost felt like a club with the dim lighting and the pop dance music played by a live DJ. We ordered the Mario pizza and the classic meat ball and spaghetti and were really impressed by both dishes.

 The pizza really surprised me. It was a nice thin crust and was quite crisp; the dough was also nice and toasty and slightly charred. The tomato sauce was just the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness (huge props for Scaddabush for using San Marzano tomatoes by the way!) combined with cured prosciutto and arugula, that was so good!

The spaghetti and meatballs was amazing. First off, the noodles were perfectly al-dente and the tomato sauce was slightly chunky (in a wonderful way). The grated parmesan was evenly immersed into the dish. What I really enjoyed was the addition of breadcrumbs here which added a wonderful texture. Some of the breadcrumbs were nice and crispy. The meatball was huge, meaty and tender, and the tomato sauce was perfect once again. The right amount of watery-ness, the right consistency, and the perfect balance - I am sure I could drink their tomato sauce!

Portion sizes were more than sufficient, service was super friendly, and it was just a wonderful experience all around; I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being a frequent Go Bus commuter, I pass by Scaddabush nearly every day, and each passing day added to the intrigue. I finally ended up going and was not disappointed. Our server was very kind and enthusiastic, offering his opinion and recommendations on all the dishes. We ended up ordering the staple Spaghetti and Stuffed Meatball, with Osso Bucco Bites and the Fresh Mozzarella with Prosciutto and Fig Jam to start. 

Each dish was amazing. The Osso Bucco bites were dry, fried ribs that were perfectly seasoned. Next came the fresh mozzarella. This stuff actually melts in your mouth. Complemented by fine cuts of prosciutto and fig jam, this was the perfect appetizer. Lastly came the spaghetti and meatball. The meatball was huge, and the mozzarella stuffing did not disappoint. It was a great entree and is definitely worth coming back for. 

The most impressive part of the experience for me was that the mozzarella and the pasta are both made fresh in-house each day. No wonder they tasted so good. 

Tip: The staple items here are the spaghetti and meatball and the fresh mozzarella. Make sure you try them! They only make the fresh mozzarella between 5pm and 10pm I believe, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I have been to crowded, busy restaurants before, but it is not excusable to have your customer seated at a table and then not attend to them for over 15 minutes.When I informed the usher, I was met with an unapologetic shrug, and it didnt matter to them that we left without placing an order. Not visiting again."}
{"text":"The only reason i am giving them two stars is for the mozzarella cheese that they had and their hostess, other than it was a terrible experience. First of all, we got greeted and seated by their hostess which was a very friendly and funny guy. Really gave me a positive buzz to try their food and service. Now we ordered the burrata mozzarella cheese , pasta , and the Italian burger. Start of the with the cheese it was DELICIOUS. Now we ordered with no bacon and we got with bacon. (First strike). We complained to the waitress she took it back it took them 23 minutes to send us a new one. Now at this point we have have been at the restaurant for 47 minutes with only one appetizer keep in mind that when we told the waitress about the mozzarella cheese dish we mentioned that we are willing to get our mains at the same time rather than they make them wait and get cold. Now 20 minutes after we got our second attempt on the mozz cheese my friend got her pasta, 15 minutes after i got my burger so in total it took then around 1 hour and 20 minutes to serve our food knowing that there was only about 5 tables in the restaurant. That was only the timing, other than the perfect mozzarella cheese that they had everything else was horrible. The pasta was tasteless, cold , chicken is not fresh, and the sauce was bland. The italian burger was just a mess. Tasteless  beef that was breaking apart, cold fried cheese and cold fries. Will not do over , the restaurant and the environment was too fancy for the quality of food and service that we got.

Also cherry on top, 

The server tried to charge us for two burrata cheese instead of one. As if it was our fault that they forgot to take the bacon off."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food, excellent service, great location!

Took the bae here this week for a drink and app date. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a few bites and a couple of drinks. Since it was their 1st anniversary week, there were some complimentary boozy drinks to try - yay!

My fave bites here are the insanely delicious house made mozzarella, massive stuffed meatball, and the zeppole dessert (little fried donuts with a cup of Nutella to dip in - heavenly!).

We met the GM, Mark, he is awesome. You can tell he truly loves what he does and knows how to build strong relationships with customers to keep them coming back. Thank you for an awesome time!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 6.30pm for 2 people, it was still early so we got seated right away. 

We started with the bomba burrata, the cheese was good nice and soft but wasnt as creamy as I wanted it to be. The tomatos and bacon bits were good though. I got the small capri pasta, the serving size was large and was very filling for only $18, it had a good amount of seafood, and the tomato sauce was good but felt bland. The pasta was also a big clump and a lot of it stuck together at the bottom, which was a disappointment. We also got a sophia pizza, the crust was thin which I like, it had lots of chicken but again tasted bland, like everything needed a bit more seasoning and salt. It wasn't expensive for the amount of food and for the area. 

Our waitress was nice, although spilled the water. The lighting was low but the candles made it nice, it was Saturday night so there was a dj spinning but nothing really to dance to or even notice. There were a lot of large groups which I guess is a good thing to know that they take large parties. I would go back if someone else chose to but definitely not my first choice for italian food"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Staff was very friendly and helpful, had a really rustic yet modern feel and the food was very flavourful and delicious. The calamari is the best I've had yet with a nice crispy breading but not too thick. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Dinner with the wifey. Had the Occo Busso to start, it was good but not what I expected. Crispy pork with a sweet and spicy glaze. Felt like something I would order at an Asian restaurant. We had the Roasted Fennel and Sausage Fettuccine and Pesto Pollo Fettuccine. Pasta A was a nice creamy tomato sauce and B was a creamy pesto. Both pasta dishes were solid. They have 3 different sizes of pasta. Wife had the small and I had the regular. Regular was more than enough to satisfy a big appetite. Will come back.

Update Feb 20, 2018: We went back for lunch on Sunday with the family and order a kids lunch special (cheese pizza, drink and vanilla sundae), stuffed meatball, and the Sophia pizza. The meat was great. The tomato sauce was slightly tart and soaked into the piece of bread underneath. The meatball was stuffed with mozzarella and pepperoni and was really good. The Sophia had peppers, chicken, goat cheese, and caramelized onions. This was very good and my wife and I both loved this."}
{"text":"Was super excited to bring my boyfriend to this Scaddabush location after going to the Richmond Hill location months back with friends and have been craving their mozzarella balls ever since! 

We arrived and were seated at 8:15, and since reviewing the menu before hand, we placed out order with our waitress right away. We ordered the 'Naked' mozzarella to start and for mains the Penne Bolognese and Margherita pizza. 

The waiting game was okay, we got our appetizer about 25 mins of waiting. Once arriving, the first thing I noticed was how small the mozzarella ball was compared the he Richmond Hill location. However, it was delicious ! I was reminded on why I chose this restaurant for dinner. 

As for the mains, we waited and waited and waited. We had seen a male (possibly manager?) walk around with pizza slices and deliver them to some tables, however not ours. As he went to the table next to us we could overhear him apologizing for the wait time for their meals. 

At around 9:05 our meals did arrive. The pizza was good,  definitely not enough cheese but will do. My boyfriend did really like his pasta. 

Overall, I would say I would come back to Scaddabush. Possibly just for the mozzarella balls but as our mains were just okay and nothing special, wouldn't choose this location for a full dinner again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is easily my favourite for large group meals. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The food is delicious and large portions for the price."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a friend and got food poisoning from the Zucca pasta. Informed the waitress after throwing up three times in the restaurant who said, oh sorry I hope you feel better. The only reason we informed her was so that she could make sure the kitchen knew and no one else got sick. Very disappointed in the response that we received but I just wanted to go home by that point."}
{"text":"Will I go back? Not for the food, only for the desert. 

Ambience: waaaaay too noisy; why was there a DJ in a restaurant?

Summerliciois menu:
Pizza appetizer: really big piece of dough with toppings, could have easily been an entree. Simple margherita, tasted right.
Caprese salad app: arugula- good. Tomatoes- good. Fried smashed crispy boccincini- yum. Salt overdose- ruined the whole thing for me.

Entree: fish crusted with Parmesan- umm high liner frozen fillets have more flavor. The side potatoes were not cooked through, and there was precisely 7 boiled French beans. 

Desert: the tiramisu arrived looking like someone had thrown up on a plate. I understand this was an attempt at deconstruction, perhaps taken too far. Having said that, it was the best tiramisu I've ever had. It was luxurious, with the flavors so perfectly balanced I don't understand why it wasn't served as the main meal :) 

Lemon panacotta- gritty, grainy, tasted like I was eating dishwashing liquid. (Comeon we've all gotten the occasional sud in our mouth, no?)"}
{"text":"AMAZING...  Highly Recommended.  Great homemade pasta"}
{"text":"Yes I know, I rated with one star but that's because you have to atleast give a star to write the review. LOL. This is an American-Italian restaurant. I should probably give you a heads up for a Long detailed review. Anyway keep reading to know why I gave 1 star. 

We made an online reservation for 5:30pm after the fancy reviews read and heard about this place. It was on the V-Day and also my Hubby's B-Day!! Yass! I thought it would be a perfectly romantic restaurant with great food. 

Reached there by 5:15 pm (before time) with only a few table occupied. For starters, even after making the reservation they gave us a very weirdly located giant common table that was shared by the others guests too. When concern raised, the server said he will check with the front desk for me. Came back with disappointment. We were still not happy about it and definitely wanted a 2 sitters table which was very much available by the way and they claimed it to be reserved. That made no sense at all as we weren't walk-ins either. Yes it was our special night, so we were adamant about it. Otherwise we are quite flexible. Finally, we got a booth. The staff suggested to request for a booth while making a reservation, which we would totally have but only challenge was if they answered our calls. Aah! You would think! 

For appetizers, we ordered Zucchini Fritters, Spinach and Artichoke Dip(looks like Guacamole) & Charity Bread. All were extremely oily, buttery, chewy, hard. Basically without any taste. Never in my life have I had such flavourless food. We sent everything back and asked for the bill. Seeing 80-90% of the leftover food, our sweet server informed the manager about it. She was kind enough to understand what went wrong and took care if it. She also offered a tiramisu on the house to makeup for the bad experience. 

No complains for the server (Adam) as he tried to do everything he could. 

But the food totally ruined our dinner date night...!

Insider Tip- From an Italian guy, the food here isn't authentic and recommended us to try another Italian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location and  I enjoyed it more the first time around. Don't get me wrong it was still a good experience just that I didn't find the food to be as good this time around.

I ordered the Zucca Ravioli and overall it tasted good. However I did find the pasta to be a little on the hard side. I also got to taste the fettucine and while it was the correct softness I found it to be a bit too bland.

Service wise it was great. The server was very friendly and helpful and checked in often to ensure we were doing ok. They even came around and let us sample one of their pasta dishes.

Definitely a pretty cool place to hang out. Although I was a little disappointed with the food I hope to come back here again soon and try it again."}
{"text":"Overall:

The cheesecake was delicious.  The rest of the food was decent to good but nothing stood out.  The service was a little bit down and up but they managed to get it right at the end.

3.2 / 5.0


Full Story:

My Scaddabush Italian experience should really be a two part story with part 1 of the experience being poor (about 2/5) and part two of the story being much better (about 4.5/5).

My girlfriend and I went to Scaddabush on Friday night feeling tired and hungry.  The staff was friendly and we were seated fairly quickly.  Italian was probably not the best choice because we had a tomato allergy but we were tired and once we sat down, we did not want to change to a different restaurant.  

Our server didn't ask about any allergies, so the recommendations we received missed the mark and we decided to choose what we could given our food limitations:

We ordered the 3-way pork bruschetta, pesto pollo pasta, capri pasta and aranciata rossa to drink.  The pork bruschetta was fairly good - greasy, tasty and satisfying (but not memorable).

When our food and drinks came, the server/serveuse who brought our drink was carrying a tray of drinks.  They spilled part of our drink onto the table and some more of another drink onto my girlfriend's shoes!  They left without cleaning up or apologizing.  I had to go grab a cloth from a nearby empty table to clean things up myself.  It was downright disappointing service. 

The food was actually ok.  The pastas were fresh and correctly seasoned...  but I was fuming over the lousy service so when the manager came by to ask how things were going I told him we were not having a good time.

The manager asked further and apologized for the service error.  They gave us a free cheesecake dessert on the house to improve our dining experience.  The cheesecake was delicious (by far the best item we ate that night) and we left the Scaddabush feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"I have to drop my rating as I found out they are not as veggie friendly as previously thought. Everything is fried in the meat fryer, and they have very few veggie options as is so that makes this difficult now to eat here. I got pretty sick the last time I came, I think I know why now."}
{"text":"Came to this location twice for birthdays, rating it a 3/4.

Food: I ordered Pesto Pollo Fettuccine, I felt as if there was too much butter in the pasta to the point where it felt like it was moisturizing my lips( I mean heyyyy), a tad overwhelming.


Cons: No reservations on the weekend, and the wait time can be up to a hour which is really inconvenient.
- Both times had to wait an unreasonable amount of time"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my bestie. Was diggin' the interior of the restaurant but that's pretty much where the positive side of my review starts and ends. Restaurant wasn't too busy since we went around 130. Sadly, our waitress wasn't very attentive to us as she took an older couples order before ours, even though we arrived long before they did and were clearly ready to order before them.

The food was mediocre at best. And I'm being generous by even saying mediocre. I mean, if you're not gonna put salt and pepper at the table for customers, you better make damn sure you season your food well! (It's not like we could even catch our waitress to even ask for any seasoning.) My bf had the snapper which came with beans and potatoes and I had the meatball sandwich with a Caeser salad. We had an order of fried calamari to share. I had a taste of her fish which was cooked well but was really bland. Her beans looked okay but the potatoes were so white! I questioned if they were actually cooked. My meatball sandwich wasn't the best as the foccacia became soggy from the sauce of the meatball and all I could taste of the caeser salad was garlic and lemon. It was also soggy with oily croutons. 

Our waitress spent most of her time charming the old couple and, once they left, she still left us unattended, paying her attention to the two guys who came in after they left. I mean, I get that you need to make tips but every customer deserves the same amount of service. 

To top it all off, we were charged for the ginger ale I ordered but didn't receive. When we told the waitress, she just crumpled up the receipt and said \"oh sorry, ill take that off!\" She walked away and disappeared. Not wanting to wait again for who knows how long, we just deducted the cost of the drink from the bill and left our cash. Needless to say, we will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Been there a few times, and loved it everytime!
They have fresh daily  made mozzarella, tried the Naked it was good especially the sauce. Then I had the Fontina Grilled Cheese with a side of Rosemary fries and again amazing. Finally,  tried the ZUCCA pasta... it is to die for. You've got to try it. All in all I always rave about this restaurant and recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a chance today with two of my friends and I have to say that I was not impressed. My friends got the \"Baked Carbonara\" and the \"Burrata\" while I got the \"Calamari  Fritti\", \"Lobster Spaghetti\" and a \"Gelato\".

First off the Calamari. The appeal was basically non existent, basically just put into a bag and served on a board with a lemon and two different sauces - \"salsa verde aïoli\" and \"fresh tomato chili dip\". It also wasn't breaded properly where huge clumps of calamari portions were just stuck together, making the taste also poor.
*Appeal - 2/10
*Taste - 3/10

Next up is the Lobster Spaghetti. I can't really say much about this dish other than it was alright. Nothing to special about it. It's not great nor bad. Just a really bland dish. In my opinion you're better off spending 30$ on something else.
*Appeal - 5/10
*Taste - 5/10

The Gelato. It had two flavours - Vanilla or Chocolate, I got the chocolate. The appeal of this was laughable at best, just three scoops of ice cream unto a square plate bowl. The taste was just average.
*Appeal 2/10
*Taste 5/10

As for what my friends got. I only took a bite out of each just out of curiosity. I would say the Burrata would be a 4/10 for me only because it was not to my personal taste. You may like it but i just did not unfortunately. As for the Baked Carbonara I would say it was the best dish by far. It was really tasty a solid 8/10.

Lastly the service. Our waitress was very kind and would check up on us often, solid service. However one of the servers which I would assume to be one of the front of house managers considering she was not in full server uniform, had the audacity to snap at me when I accidentally bumped a butter knife off my table with my elbow saying \"Wow you're just going to start throwing things around now.\" with a sassy tone. That is a great way to treat your customers considering your restaurant just opened a couple days ago. Real smart move 10/10.

Overall this place was sadly a huge waste of $60+. You would be better off spending your money on any of the other \"casual fine dining\" restaurants in the area. Definitely would not be coming back here."}
{"text":"The food is always great but the serves leave a lot to say. Im not sure why but we always get a server with an attitude or they forget about us. The food always comes pretty fast. I love their squash ravioli and their chicken limone, they have fresh mozzarella. If i have to pick between this location or the one in Mississauga i would to Mississauga. I like the decor on this one and how close it is to us being two blocks down. Also our friend lives on the Aura condo so super close to him and he likes it too"}
{"text":"First of all, I love Scaddabush the only thing i find very awkward is servers I seem to always get. I love their fresh mozzarella"}
{"text":"Was here for my birthday a few months back. Had their fresh mozzarella, seafood salad, and pizza to share.
They pride themselves in being a fresh and authentic Italian restaurant and I decided to visit based on good recommendations. 

I thought the mozzarella was quite bland tbh. You eat it with your hands and it comes with bread and sea salt and some cranberries. Not much taste in the mozzarella and it didn't really melt like you would imagine (I pictured it to be more like hot pizza but it wasn't).

My seafood pasta was made with their in house fresh pasta. It was my first time having it and it was quite good. However for their seafood the calamari was quite skimpy and same goes for the shrimp. It came in a marinara tomato type sauce. 

We shared pizza (the one with all the meat on it) and it was pretty good - you could cut up the pizza yourself with provided scissors. A little salty but expected due to the cured meats. The crust was good. Probably the safest/best thing I ate the whole night.

Probably won't be back.. Might try Levetto which is similar with better reviews."}
{"text":"I came here for a farewell lunch with my coworkers. Basically a very large party for the craziest time of day. Service was very good, I think they're truly taking into consideration all the bad reviews they've received based on service and are trying to improve. 

Janelle our server was very attentive, sociable, and informative. We ordered the sociables to share and the standout was definitely the mozzarella. It was very moist and flavourful, definitely a must have. Second would be the meatball, which I found delicious, and the chicken parm bites. 

I had the Peach Bellini and that was very yummy; pretty much an upgrade in quality to the Miletsone's version. 

The pastas and pizzas were a bit more lackluster than the appetizers, which seems to be the general consensus on here. I had the Sophia pizza, which lacked flavour surprisingly. The Pomodoro my coworker got tasted much more flavourful (albeit spicy). I would definitely get that one next time or try the Lobster Spaghetti. The Pesto Pollo Fettuccine also missed the mark in its sauce. 

However the Chocolate Toffee Jar Cake tasted great. Yes it does taste like a higher quality McCain cake, but who cares it tastes great. 

I think this place is very good for large parties and a good option for a chain trying to provide a bit more quality than the average restaurant. One thing I must say, that although sometimes dishes may not have worked (or were lackluster) the quality of the ingredients never felt cheap.

I think the price point is a bit more expensive than average, but not by much especially when you take into consideration the portions & quality their presenting commercially. I mean Jack Astor's Asiago Bow Ties will cost you $18.46 and that's not even fresh pasta made in-house! 

People need to understand food prices have increased and unless you haven't been in a restaurant in the past 20 years, there's no reason to complain about price (big pet peeve). 

Although this isn't the best Italian restaurant in Toronto it's definitely a good attempt at bringing quality products onto a commercial platform and I'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Amazing late night place for whatever Italian you are craving. Didn't try be bar drinks but the home made pasta is awesome. Especially for being 10:40 at night and starving and expecting to only have fast food options. I ordered the carbonara and was not disappointed. The egg on top was great but the freshly graded parmesan cheese was awesome. Husband had the shrimp and chicken which was also amazing and a close second to my dish. Will have to go back to try their fresh mozzarella. Dj playing was odd but not annoying, just different. Random will Smith playing in the background but hey who doesn't like a throw back"}
{"text":"Yeah it's a no for me... Was recommended the margarita pizza by the bartender lol.  I 'lol' only because I wonder if he was just 'trying' to sell an item on the menu? Does he not know good food? The tomato sauce base was so bland.  The sauce tasted like a brand I'd buy in the no-name section  of No Frills, if I was desperate and there were no other tomato sauces  left on the planet. I didn't finish the pizza - it was meh.

I've had the cheesecake from Scaddabush at the Front street location, and the Mississauga location and it was creamy, however the same cheesecake at the Etobicoke location tasted tougher in texture. For the first time in my life, I can't really put a finger on it, as to why it was off to me. I noticed too it was a little tanned at the top of the cheesecake and I've never seen the cheesecake like that before at the other two locations. For an Italian restaurant, they really need to step up their game. It did not taste like authentic Italian cuisine. At the end of the day, I would have been happier going to Metro to buy the pizza that they make fresh and  fire in the oven. That's sad really... that I would have been more satisfied going to a chain grocery store for pizza.. C'mon , you had one job Scaddabush. Well won't be returning  to the restaurant. I guess  I'll make Joey's my hot spot for my end of the week treat!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 2.5 stars I would, but there wasn't anything unpleasant about this place so I'll just give it 3 rather than 2. 

Came here for a late dinner with a friend on a Tuesday night, this was the only place that was open that caught our eye. The overall look of the restaurant was nice and tidy, very modern. The service was nice considering we came in 5 minutes before their kitchen stopped taking orders. Perhaps this was also the reason why the portions seemed so small. I got the Chicken Parm ($20) and I gotta say, while it wasn't unpleasant, it could've been a lot better. The chicken itself was great in quality however lacking in quantity. The spaghetti that came with it was either slightly bland or unusually sour. I didn't do any sort of \"research\" into this place since I didn't have the time, however I would be willing to return and give it another shot. 

Overall, nice place and friendly staff however the food seemed lacklustre compared to the price they charged. I'd still be willing to give it another chance someday though."}
{"text":"Try the butcher pizza! It's piled with toppings and tastes amazing! It even comes with scissors making it easy to cut! 

Paid $23 total, which is around what you'd expect from a nice place like Scaddabush, but it was soo worth it! 

Staff were great and overall atmosphere was just a nice place to be on a Saturday night to celebrate a couple friend's birthdays!

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Best pasta and they make their mozzarella in house (it's equally amazing as the pasta). Service has been mostly good- with the exception of a few mess ups but the issue was always resolved to my satisfaction. Desserts are fantastic- especially the tiramisu, never really liked tiramisu until I tried it here. Overall, I love it"}
{"text":"Their pizza is delicious. All of me. Can't really go wrong here. Everything else is average or a bit on the salty side but I like that. Decent."}
{"text":"Had Chicken Parmesan tasted really good. Also they serve an appetizer \"Mozzarella cheese\" on wooden plate with bread. Liked the atmosphere and the food."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night and the atmosphere was great on the patio with great mix of 90s and new music playing (although I have to admit it was kind of weird to have the sidewalk in between the patio and the actual restaurant. We ordered the Zucca pasta (Butternut squash) and the Mario pizza. Both were really good, especially the Zucca pasta, which was very rich and flavourful. 
The service was a bit slow at times but nothing that prevented us from enjoying our time and the pasta servings are a tad small (I'm a bit biased since I'm a hungry person)."}
{"text":"2nd visit to Scaddabush, 1st time at Mississauga location. 9 person walk-in and they seated us within minutes even though they were busy (guess they heard us talking about going somewhere cuz of the 45 mins wait). Gotta say, I really dig this place; good food, good vibe, fast friendly service... what's not to like? I recommend the Baked Carbonara pasta and Spaghetti and Meatball. The Chicken Parmesan was decent but IMO not one of their stronger dishes. It was cooked well, I just felt the breading could have had more seasoning. The Charity Bread and Calamari appetizers were also good. All in all a great meal and will definitely return when I'm in the mood for some quality Italian cuisine. :)"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, food and drinks are great. It's a place to go with friends or with family.  The menu has lots of options and is priced decently. I last had the best salad and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My coworker took me out for lunch on my birthday and we decided to try Scaddabush cause we were feeling some Italian goodness. 
From my past experience, I did like the Alice Fazoolis but it was not something I was excited about. I have to say the menu items and the atmosphere of the new place is something I would definitely go back for.

I had their specialty, which was their meatball with gluen-free pasta (really glad they had this option) and tried their mango peach bellini. In my opinion, I really liked the flavours and portion size of the pasta and the drink was yummy.  I would definitely come back here with my girlfriends.

Since it was my birthday, my coworker arranged for them to bring me a candle-lit tartufo- definitely a nice finish. I also want to mention the server was great and super friendly!"}
{"text":"I would have liked to give this restaurant a higher rating but I simply couldn't since it has declined in food quality drastically since its' grand opening. 

When I first tried this location the food was great! Desserts were even impressive. But not anymore. 

My pasta was over cooked (mushy) as was my zeppole dessert, instead of it being soft and fluffy (like the first time I had it) it was stale and over cooked so that it was bordering crunchy. Really a big let down, since there is so much potential here to be something great. 

I'm hoping I got them on an off day but even the staff were moody and unwelcoming when I walked in. Sad to say I actually miss Alice Fazooli's from here because at least my food was good and for an Italian restaurant, I expect them to know how to cook a proper pasta al dente. Here's hoping they pull it together."}
{"text":"There's a lot of reviews about them already and am speaking from a first timer's experience that this place was absolutely delicious and I do recommend them. We loved our meal and our server was also very friendly. I really loved my lobster spaghetti (best I had so far) and my partner liked his meatball spaghetti as well. 

The ambiance is casual and chill and am really liking their interior. And I don't usually say that because I normally comment about how either normal or weird the interiors are.

Anyway, this place is great for groups or even taking your date here. We went during a lunch so it was fairly busy but I recommend doing a reservation just in case..we just got lucky when we came and got seated right away.

I would give them a perfect rating but towards the end our bill took a while to arrive (our server either forgot or he thought we needed to sit for awhile but who knows). But nonetheless, I will be coming back here in the future for sure."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars
Service: 1 star

If you've ever wanted to know what it might feel like to be invisible, visit Scaddabush on Yonge and Gerrard to find out.  The service here was horrendous, no other way to describe it.  We were seated and weren't even given water for 10 minutes.  When our waitress finally made an appearance, we put in our entire order for fear we may not see her again for another 20 minutes.  Our appetizer beat our drink order out (which was brought out by the hostess).  After we finished our meal, we didn't see our waitress again for another 18 minutes.  When we asked for the check she apologized for the poor service but still looked shocked when she received a 10% tip.  After service like that, I can't believe she expected anything more.  I can't gripe about the food, it was very good, but the service really soured us on the entire experience.  Don't come here if you have anywhere to be in the next 2-3 hours, otherwise sit back and enjoy the invisibility cloak."}
{"text":"I walked in and no one knew which table to give me when it wasn't even busy...
I ordered the spaghetti & meatball. This is the first Scaddbush I've been to.
Food arrived quickly which I was pleased about. However, I wasn't a fan of the meatball.. very wet and almost like baby-foodish. Not cute.

I would come back but definitely not for the spaghetti... I just got very nauseous after eating it."}
{"text":"This Scaddabush  location has been around since June, what was the old Jack Astors dinning area is now a taken over by this new restaurant chain.
Being a new place the restaurant is hustling with the busy Friday night dinner crowd.
The ambiance has no shortage as a reminder you're in an Italian restaurant and bar with the decor and paintings. Overall the earthly wooden furniture and lighting gives you a cozy feeling knowing the evening has only begun.
For drinks our party of three ordered a bottle of Andalus Argetine Malbec, robust with lots of flavors we ordered a list of shareable items.

Charity breads, (garlic and the other being spicy) portions of this dish goes to supporting local charities. 
However I found the bread extremely drenched in oil.

Goat cheese dip was magnificently rich and creamy, however rather than serving bread, nacho chips would have been better since the bread was oily as well.

Polenta was delish. Served with a marinara sauce it was tender...best dish out of all three. 

Overall 
Ambiance 4/5
Service 5/5
Food 2.5/5
Cleanliness 3/5"}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner with friends. The place itself is very nice. Nice decor. Very nice atmosphere. Great place to just hang out. Busy and clean. However, the food is just average.  The mozzarella with bread was good. We tried couple of pizzas. They were very salty. Meatball sandwich extremely salty. Calamari were good. Desserts were very good. Vanilla ice cream and Zeppole was very delicious and the cheesecake was wonderful."}
{"text":"Big kudos to Kris for setting up this GTA YELP ELITE party at the newly opened Scaddabush last night.  
first off, great atmosphere!  love the open concept of the stone oven pizza kitchen as you enter as well as the kitchen located back of the restaurant.  The overall set up of this place great!! especially the wrap around bar counter.  However get down to the food!!

MEATBALL SLIDERS: 5/5 served on a wooden board, perfect bite size, melt in your mouth fresh meat burger.  Perfect balance of flavors

BRUSCHETTA RUSTICA: served on a foccacia bread, infused with all the necessary ingredients, roma tomatos,  roasted garlic, basil, balsamic reduction! 4/5

MARGHERITA PIZZA: presentation was great, thin gourmet in-house made pizza topped off with some light mozarella, san marzano sauce, and some basil...mmm perfect melody of flavor. 4/5

PINGUE PROSCIUTTO With Bocaccini Cheese
Focaccia crostini, fig jam, extra-virgin olive oil, this was a cute one bite experience, the figs really heightened the flavors of this appetizer, sweetness mixed in with the salt of the prosciutto and softness of the cheese...mmm orchestra of flavors indeed! 

overall great experience, got to meet a lot of fellow ELITE YELPERS, now I am trying to get my +1 who was with me to join the Yelp movement!!! but she's vegetarian...I KNOW I KNOW!! ITS A SIN and A WASTE LOL...to be vegetarian. :) jkz."}
{"text":"Get the fresh made mozzarella cheese infused with honey. It was a hot ball of sweet and cheesy delightfulness. Although good, it's quite pricey. My ball of cheese and some bread came to $17 after tax and tip.

I also tried some of the charity bread - felt good since proceeds went to charity but didn't feel good about the garlic breath and eating the pool of oil the bread was drench in.

The cheese was the highlight of my experience but the service was subpar. It was slow and we kept getting other table's orders brought to us.  Okaaaay yeaaah I came in with a big group and big groups are harder to server but Scaddabush and I expected a bit more attention if I'm paying an enforced 18% tip."}
{"text":"Quick service, can get a little slow when it is busy but got seated within 30 mins without reservations during peak timess! Love their Naked fresh mozza appetizer and zucca ravioli !"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday.  It was my first time experiencing this location and have to say I am willing to drive the distance to come out here.  The service was excellent, as a guest my experience was outstanding!!  Definitely bringing my Italian goodies with me here next time!!  Beautiful atmosphere amazing Saturday night DJ, and most importantly quality food!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend last week. We ordered the bruschetta, smoked bacon & egg pizza, lobster spaghetti and seafood pasta, all for two to share!! I have to admit their portions are quite generous - our pastas were huge! In terms of taste, the food was decent but not outstanding. I was expecting really amazing food as there was a huge hype on instagram about their opening. The lobster spaghetti was the best out of all the dishes we ordered, but it wasn't memorable. Scaddabush is located in a good area though - right beside STC, so they are actually one of the better restaurant choices in the mall area. I would come back if I was shopping at STC."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is just wonderful, it really is. It's reasonably-priced, delicious Italian food.  I have been to this restaurant 3 times and each time has been great. The spaghetti and giant meatball, carbonara pasta, and fresh mozzarella are my favourite dishes. It's a giant restaurant but manages to maintain a rustic, warm feel. The servers are friendly and unpretentious, much unlike another well-known Italian restaurant I recently dined at *cough*bucayorkville*cough*. Based on other reviews for Scaddabush on yelp, it also seems like this restaurant is very open to feedback and listens to their customers - not something I can say for most restaurants! Anyway, highly recommended - a solid addition to the bay and college neighbourhood."}

{"text":"Really enjoy coming here due to atmosphere and menu options. Very Italian indeed! I've had a good time during all the times I've been to this location."}
{"text":"My cousin and I are visiting and staying across the street at the Chelsea Hotel. We were hanging out at the pool when a friend who is local texted and said there's a restaurant across the street that makes fresh mozzarella. We immediately came back to our room to get ready! 

We were seated very quickly and ordered the naked mozzarella, pesto pollo pasta, and calamari. The mozzarella was a little harder to cut into than I'm used to, but it was absolutely delicious! The bread that came with it was really hard which I'm not a fan of so didn't really eat that. I tried the tomato jam which was okay (not generally a fan of tomatoes). I pretty much just ate the mozzarella by itself which I was perfectly happy with. The pasta and calamari were okay, mozzarella was definitely the highlight of the meal. 

I really love the decor and ambiance as well. It has a rustic feel, but also has a live DJ. Somehow it works well together. You can watch the mozzarella being made too!"}
{"text":"Came to Scaddabush due to one of my best friends being a huge huge fan of this chain.
He had not tried this location either so it was a nice ''new'' review for both of us.

We made a reservation online and were seated promptly when entering the restaurant. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

I have a severe food allergy which unfortunately is in a lot of the dishes in this particular menu. Upon explaining to the server my allergy. She immediately called the manager over who asked again what my exact allergy was, and promised to make sure that my order was cooked on separate pots and pans and kept segregated from any possible cross contamination. 
The fact that they were so accommodating was very impressive.

I got a salad with grilled chicken added, which was a bit under whelming unfortunately, but omg.. the gelato... FANTASTIC! 
I could easily just go to Scaddabush just to order the gelato. YUM

Bathrooms are clean, and private.. (doors to the floor..yes!)
Not much parking in this plaza though, so recommend parking at cineplex plaza especially at night. 

way to go scaddabush, 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here a while back when we felt like some pasta, and decided to try this new place.  I felt it didn't look much different from the old Fazoolis, but had been a long time since I had gone there.
Decor was nice and service was excellent, forgot the name of our server, but he was very friendly. Even informed us when he put in the orders.   

Was absolutely disappointed with the food.  The caesar salad was great, probably the best I ever had.  Pizza was good, very neat that it came with scissors so you cut your own. Very handy for little kids.  Main was seafood pasta and spaghetti and meatballs.  Plenty of seafood but the pasta was not good at all. Meatball was ok, but again, the spaghetti was not good.  Almost like it was not cooked right. Very surprised and disappointed at a place that makes everything from scratch, as our expectations were quite high to have some good pasta.

Will not be going back, maybe some takeout salad lol."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here. The service was the best part of our meal - Our waitress was super attentive. We enjoyed the highly recommended polenta bites starter. Although, not on the menu the bar whipped up a freshly made strawberry lemonade for my husband . For dinner, I had the pasta with meat sauce and my husband had a custom made pizza. Both were yummy. For dessert we tried the cheesecake and it was fabulous. Bonus points: there was a DJ spinning hits throughout the evening, the music was great! The decor is modern. The restroom clean with fresh flowers inside. There are several family style tables which could make for the perfect place to host a large gathering or an opportunity to meet some new friends. To top it off, our server checked to see what movies were playing at the nearby theatre. So you're probably wondering why not 5 stars, right? Well there was no complimentary bread which I thought odd at an Italian restaurant and my pasta was al dente, which I understand is the traditional way to serve it but my American palate wished the noodles were a wee bit softer."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with Committee members from ASTM. Tried their spaghetti and meatballs. Bit dry. Asked for extra sauce and it was on its way for over five minutes!

Never head such experience in Toronto or Canada before for food. First in over 35 years. Hope they take this seriously. Disappointed.

Alex, Supervisor came by and expressed regret and offered some dessert. A good gesture. He has his work cutout in training his staff to be attentive and responsive.

My dinner at back at the hotel is in Photo 2."}
{"text":"You say scadda...I say bush!  (I have no idea why I wrote that other than the fact it sounds funny)

Anyways, been here twice and I have yet to be disappointed.  The food is great and you can tell fresh.  The mozzarella which is made in house is divine.  It's a must try!  The pastas are fresh and filling and the 2 pizzas that I tried (the Margherita and the chicken/goat cheese) were delicious.  Both times I have had to basically roll out of the restaurant.

Their blood orange cucumber mint mojitos are just simply what I imagine heaven must taste like.

They have a huge space upstairs if you want to have a private event.  The atmosphere is fun and the servers are great

Definitely on my list to head back again"}
{"text":"Pleasently surprised with interior, clean, good lighting.
Excellent pizza, tons of pepperoni.
Very good chicken parm."}
{"text":"Very nice decor and lively ambience, although the noise level is on the higher side. Food is rather disappointing. 

We went on Monday afternoon for lunch. On the menu, it said fresh mozzarella is available from 5pm so we weren't going to order it but our server came and said \"your fresh mozzarella is made by so-and-so\" and wrote down the name on our table. So we tried ordering it when she came back for our orders but she said it wasn't available. Then why tell us it's being made?? 

Anyways, for the food:

Bacon and egg pizza: it's basically a pizza with two Sunnyside up eggs that you're supposed to pop and spread it around before eating. It was a neat concept, but it tasted just like ordinary brunch. It has quite a bit of hot peppers so watch out if you don't like spice. Overall, it was okay, not mind-blowing.

Pesto pasta: this one seriously lacked flavour. I expected the nutty, fragrant basil flavour, but my fettuccine came with a very runny, bland green sauce. The pasta itself was nice and fresh though. 

I think I'm going to stick with their mozzarella and meatball spaghetti if I ever decide to return."}
{"text":"Great service at lunch. Go for the seasonal special. They seem like better meals than their regular menu."}
{"text":"The mozzarella is must have... for sure try honey mozzarella...
Butcher pizza is amazing...
Love the environment..."}
{"text":"Alrighty... Been a long time coming.  As a veteran of Alice Fazoolis, it was sad to see it go away BUT I'm thrilled that Scaddabush is trying to do something unique and country savvy chic.  It's definitely not the typical Italian chain restaurant that I'm sick of.  Staff and servers are extremely polite gracious and beautiful people who make you feel so welcome! Decor hasn't changed drastically!, patio is beautiful and definitely has that Italian countryside relaxed feel. Now onto the food...... 
Their mozzarella which is made fresh daily! With crostini prosciutto  and fig jam is an explosion of all things wonderful in this world! Lemme stress this..... The fig jam and mozzarella with prosciutto is something you need to experience my words are not gonna do it enough justice ! Meatballs r good, calamari is standard, osso bucco bites r delicious. 
Pizzas are definitely a must have! Really good fresh toppings! The Italian burger was also quite yummy their rosemary garlic fries are addictive!  Their sangria was pretty good but I think it could have used more brandy and more fresh fruit but I mean I'm seriously not gonna complain about sangria lol they have a good selection of Italian beers... 
What makes this place stand out is the fact that they provide you with all fresh ingredients from their veggies to their pasta to their cheese and honestly in today's day and age that goes a long way.  Their atmosphere is fun and your whole dining experience is enjoyable! 

Ps plz get the fig jam  and mozza lol"}
{"text":"So it was my first time trying this place and I really loved it! The service was top-notch our waiter was a breath of fresh air and sunshine! The pasta is freshly made and the chefs seem to know a thing or two about food. My group of friends ordered a bunch of main courses to share so got to try a few dishes. The taste was so yum. The only note I would say is that our waiter said how the one for 2 people is a LOT of food but when it came out it was not so our table of 4 we ordered more to satisfy our tummies... So the portions are fair for the money but it is made in house along with the cheese and meatballs all which were awesome so thumbs up ... It was only loud to begin with because there was a party of like 20 beside us so our waitress was awesome and moved us to a less noisy section :)"}
{"text":"I am most definitely a fan of this place. I often come here for small get togethers or semi-special occasions. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich and that was just great, if you're looking for a heavy/filling sandwich. The stuffed meatball spaghetti was also great, however, my only complaint would be, the last few times I came, the spaghetti and other pasta dishes were slightly under salted? Other than that, i have always enjoyed my time whenever I dine here."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, but the food is terrible. I came here twice to try out their meatballs, mozzarella cheese board, carbonara, squash ravioli and gelato. Everything was below average except the squash ravioli - this was the only dish I thought it was fine. The rest was something like you tried to make it at home and failed taste.  If you want a real Italian food, go to Donatello on elm street (which is 3 minutes away from this place). I will come back to this restaurant for drinks but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since it opened, with both small parties and large. It has been great every time. Attentive but not overbearing servers, delicious food, great drink options and a wonderful atmosphere. Highly recommended for something casual but off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Came here with my beau for my birthday dinner and am so glad I did!

The service was not attentive at first (when we arrived, it took a while after we were seated for someone to bring us menus and then for someone to notice we were at the table) but after that it was smooth sailing. We were not in a hurry and did not mind the wait, but if we were I may have deducted a star for the inconvenience. 

First lets discuss the decor. Exposed brick, mirrors, an assortment of Edison lights and lit candles make this place trendy and intimate without sacrificing the urban appeal. 

We started with the spinach and artichoke dip, which was served with light, crunchy crostinis. It was ridiculously good possessing both a creaminess and a density in the flavour. The sundried tomatoes were an excellent touch and had me questioning why all spinach and artichoke dips do not come with these salty delicacies?! 

We decided to split a small order of the zucca (butternut squash) ravioli and the Diavolo pizza 
(spicy chicken, mozzarella, Pecorino cheese, caramelized onions, roasted grape tomatoes, balsamic reduction). The ravioli was gorgeous and delicious. Had we not have also gotten the pizza I would have regretted getting the smallest size. Despite being rich in flavour, I swear I could have eaten three times as many of those delicious pockets of scrumptious and flavourful squash. The pizza was awesome, but way spicier than we were anticipating! Luckily we can stand the heat and had wine and beer to help wash it down, but be wary if you don't like it hot.

We were too full for dessert, but that changed when our server whose name I don't recall brought us out a small plate of warm, gooey chocolate chip cookies. Damn those were good cookies! What a great way to top off a delicious meal. 

Definitely recommend Scaddabush! I know it's a small but growing chain, but it did not have the atmosphere of a chain at all. Definitely a great place for a date or to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. I don't remember the exact name but I got the squash ravioli and one of their pizzas to split with a friend. The squash ravioli was amazing. It came with a white sauce which I prefer and was the perfect portion. Their pizza was average, and I'm glad I shared it because it's a bit much for one person. Also had these zucchini frites as an appetizer and I really liked those. I would recommend to try a few things on the menu since they have so many great options and share it so you get the chance to taste a bit of everything. The waiter was very nice and informative, and it wasn't busy at all when I went (around 11:45pm). Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I went to in Canada so far, the food was very good in taste and size. Nice atmosphere, and the service was good."}
{"text":"My own gripe was that my order was forgotten and so I ended up forfeiting it. I tried some of my friend's meals and they were great. I should mention that I went here at late hours, perhaps service isn't best when they are close to closing."}
{"text":"Came with my partner and a friend earlier this week. 

We ordered the Fresh Mozarella (naked), Pesto Pollo, and Bianca Pizza to share. 

I ordered a Peach Mango Bellini, which stood at a towering 4 inches above the rim of the glass, and was likely the best drink I've ever had. My partner and friend both ordered white wine sangrias and raved about them. 

We loved the food and our waitress was fantastic - definitely going to be returning soon."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out due to its good reviews. When I entered in, I felt as if I would absolutely love it there. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I was kind of disappointed. 
I had the shrimp pasta which was okay. There was nothing too special about it. Along with that, I also ordered the charity bread. I've never tried charity bread before, and this one was really oily. I felt as if they just soaked the bread in oil and served it. 
For dessert, I ordered the tira misu. But, the waitress had accidentally given me a wrong order (it was chocolate in a jar), and ended up giving me that for free, and wow they're desserts were AWESOME!!  
I would probably go back just for the desserts."}
{"text":"Really, really, REALLY enjoy this place. 

I've been here about twice now and both times I've gotten pizza (being a pizza-enthusiast and all) with no regrets. 

The latest one I had was the Bacon and Egg. Satisfies my need for everything yummy and breakfasty, but not too greasy surprisingly. Eating it was a bit of a mess, but it was well worth it. The egg is sunnyside up with athe yolk still a bit raw so you get the juiciness of all the sunshine when you poke through it on your bacon. It's also perfect to dip your pizza crust in afterwards! 

The rest of the pizzas have a bit of a fusion of a lot of things unlike your traditional thin crust pizza places like my fave, Libretto. 

Still, really good fusions. The rest of the menu I have yet to try, but from the looks on the other tables, the helpings seem to be quite generous and very delicious (people are smiling). 

Overall, I would definitely come here again. Also sign up for the Scaddabush social club if ya want to save $10 for a $30 meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants! I'm actually planning to have my birthday dinner here this year. It has a great environment and I love the decor. It's great if you're planning a group dinner. The food is FANTASTIC! The mozzarella is made from scratch right in the restaurant and you can actually watch the chefs making it! They have a great selection of appetizers, pizzas and pastas. Prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"a late night meal.. take out.
We ordered the burchetta, some veggie pasta and the stuffed meatball and pasta.

I opted for gluten free noodles. Everything had a strange sweet taste... I couldn't figure it out

mehhh"}
{"text":"My friend recommended that we should give this place a try and so we did! We came here for a celebratory lunch thing right after our class and let me tell you, it was a great idea coming here.

The interior of the place was great, has a very italian hipster vibe to it with the wooden tables and the soothing and warm colour palette of browns and beiges (I guess they're kinda the same colour family huh, let me get away with it so I can sound super fancy). There was a bar in the centre of the restaurant and TVs around the restaurant. There was a pizza kitchen that made pizzas that was separated from the actual kitchen, where they made the pastas and other dishes.

Before I get to the food, the service here was AMAZING! As we walked in, we were all greeted with open arms and lovely smiles! Once we were seated, we were given a super awesome waitress. My friends and I absolutely loved her. She was just super down to earth, great to talk to and loved interacting with us. She would check up on us and keep us entertained with her stories and comments. Sometimes she would chime into our conversations and provide her own insight about the subject of matter that my friends and I would be discussing at our table.

We ordered the Baked Carbonara, Zucca, Calamari and the Pesto Pollo. They were all so delicious and super fresh! The Baked Carbonara and the Zucca were pretty standard but what made the Baked Carbonara stand out was the cute little poached egg that was added on the top of the dish for extra creaminess and flavour. To be honest, the calamari wasn't all that good. It's hard to get calamari right and I can't blame them! Now the Zucca...oh oh oh Zucca. You are so delicious. Who knew butternut squash ravioli would taste so good?! This dish was absolutely delicious and guess what, these cute little raviolis are my new favourite.

We also ordered the White Sangria and that was also delicious.

Overall, this place has become my new little favourite spot to eat if I'm around the Square One area but would I venture up here from Toronto to eat? Nah, but if you're around the area or live close by, by all means please do check it out! 

Also something that I want to add in, I've heard that dinner time gets really busy and things get frantic, I think if you really want to enjoy the experience from this restaurant to it's fullest, you've gotta come here during lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for an early dinner today after work. We started off on the patio because of the beautiful weather we're having but because it was so windy we opted to go back inside. Upon going back inside we were quickly seated at another table and we took some time before deciding what to eat. I think during that time our server Eric forgot about us which was fine because we were busy socializing. He came back about ten minutes later and we ordered our food. My friend ordered a peach and mango Bellini and mozzarella and prosciutto cheese. She ended up eating all her bread and they gave her more free from charge. I ordered the grilled vegetable salad and a Caesar salad which was enjoyable as well. Overall the food was good and so was the atmosphere. We enjoyed our time here and would definitely come back again. After our meal they asked us to fill out a survey and in turn we got a card for a free app next time! Definitely a bonus !!!!"}
{"text":"Current rating: Not a place to bring business clients or host business functions. 

Overall, tonight's experience was very poor! Typically the experience is good. But even the most simple soup... Italian wedding could not be that difficult. When explaining to the waiter that on the menu it states meatballs, and you let them know that \"one\" tiny meatball cannot be considered a item to highlight. His reply was \"its tiny, so you must of missed it\". Clearly I didn't even touch my soup and it was insulting to suggest that to a client.  Service and and quality of food go hand-in-hand, really wished the experience was better."}
{"text":"Upside:

Great meatball sandwich
Good kid's meal selection (comes with two big cookies as dessert)
Portion and prices are okay for downtown Toronto
Moretti.on tap

Downside:

You spend a lot of time looking for your waiter
They forget things you order
The lighting is horrible. You can barely read the menu.
Just give us bread. You're an Italian restaurant. 
The \"charity bread\" is $4 and a very small portion.
Needs a better draft beer selection

Suggestion for management

I'm not the first reviewer to note service is slow and inconsistent. Better training? I'd like to come back but I really hate a place that wants $20 for a meal (however good) but you spend a lot of time wondering when someone will take your order, when they'll remember to bring the things you ordered, etc."}
{"text":"Who're these guys trying to kid? This is Alice Fazooli's with a different name ... same staff, same furnishings, same food, same menus and same quality. 

That is not a good thing as the Alice Fazooli's at this location was never any good. I came here for a friend's birthday party once, and I figured why not? I've always walked by it, but never been inside. The layout is... different. It's like they took a parking garage and turned into a restaurant. This idea could have worked really well if not for the weird setup: SCADDABUSH tries very hard to be both chic and hipster ...they try so hard they end up ruining both ventures and just look desperate. 

The food is a waste of time. Although the portions are quite big, the food has no taste ...having lots of really bad food does not make up for the fact that you're eating bad food. I love risotto, so I thought I'd give it a shot; what I got can only be described as a pile of mushy rice with black pepper flakes. The taste was worse than the description. So being a glutton for punishment, I came back at a later date and tried their pasta w/ sausages ....again, no flavor. I asked them to make it spicy (I like me my spices!), they gave me Frank's Red and some black pepper. I know for a fact that Italian food is fricken delicious! This place was an insult to the food it claims to highlight. 

The saving grace: mood lighting + drinks. This is a place to come and get (moderately priced) drinks after work and just hang out. They have cheap beers days (I think it's Thursday, not sure), so it ends up working out for a group of buddies. They've also got a pretty decent selection of mixed drinks, so everyone was quite happy with that. 

TL;DR: Food sucks, drinks are nice. I think they want to get you so drunk, so you don't taste the food. That must be it."}
{"text":"This place is very crowded on Friday nights and they do not take reservations at that time. I called in and wanted to reserve a table for a large party but the hostess told me to just come in at around 8:30 and they should be able to accommodate us. I came in earlier than that to get a table but now I'm told the wait is 2 hours because there are many large parties ahead of me. I put my name down anyways to leave my options open and I left to go elsewhere. I get a text message 45 minutes later saying my table is ready but when I call them I found out the hostess had wrongly imputed us as a table of 2 people. The hostess goes to speak to the manager who essentially does nothing except offer an apology and I'm told they can accommodate us if we come in but only for 2 people. Their incompetence and disorganization is very frustrating and after this terrible experience I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I came back to try their famous meatball.

We were a small group. They had a huge table of 50 beside us, but they were still very courteous with their service!"}
{"text":"Dinner tonight at Mississauga location.

Caesar salad mushy, tasted like anchovies.  Waiter laughed.

Gluten pasta surcharge. No warning.

We eat here at least 3 times a month.

No fresh pepper or cheese for salad.

Poor service, long wait, no seats at the bar, we did not enjoy our visit."}
{"text":"Some positives, some negatives.  Newly renovated, newly renamed Alice Fazooli's in the parking lot across from Square One.

Place was really busy, 20 minute wait at 1PM on a Thursday for a table so we just sat in the bar area instead.

Service was pretty good, lots of people checking up on us and refilling the sodas as needed.  Servers and waitress both friendly although a little over the top in trying to sell some of the dishes, and overhyping them.

Positives:  

Caesar Salad nice and garlicky, real bacon, and nice crunchy large homemade croutons

Generous with the grana padano cheese, freshly grating as much of it as you could possibly want on any item.

Calamari Fritti nicely fried and the breading was good and crispy

Stuffed Meatball was definitely tasty, although dining companion said there wasn't enough cheese inside

Complimentary tableside large bottle of water (tap) automatically dropped off to table without asking

Negatives:

The big screw up was that the breaded chicken parmesan cutlet tasted FISHY.  They've obviously been using the same fryer oil to do the calamari or other fried seafood items.  This was a big blunder.  Told the waitress and she was pretty indifferent about it, didn't offer any discount or even to have it remade.  Took a star for this alone.

Peppers added to the chicken sandwich were very raw and had the skins on; you'd take a bite out of the sandwich and have to pick out the crunchy raw pepper from your teeth and remove it. 

No fresh mozzerella cheese, their big boastful selling point, except in the hours of 5pm-9pm.  Stupid.

Calamari, while a positive in the sense that it tasted good, wasn't really big enough to share

Garlic/Rosemary French Fries were very very saturated in oil, and served in a metal \"cup\" that doesn't absorb anything so there's a very unappealing pile of oil at the bottom.

The $16 order of spaghetti and meatball was a single solitary meatball served on a rather small portion of pasta.  I don't expect monster portions but I mean come on, it's pasta, one of the cheapest things in the world to make.. 

No complimentary bread of any sorts is outrageous and just plain chincy especially for Italian food, where it's meant to dip into sauces and so on.  Took another star specifically for this.

I guess they are going for the upscale experience but that doesn't have to mean miniaturizing the portions just to keep things looking \"neat\" and \"compact\"

Overall; the food had its positives and negatives, and I would have given it at least a 3/5 but there were quite a few things they should have addressed, even after I mentioned it to the staff.

Will try it once more at a later date, during the hours they actually have fresh cheese.  Will post any updates then."}
{"text":"This is an update to my last experience.  After I posted my review, I was contacted by Scaddabush and invited to come back for another try.  My boyfriend and I thought, why not? and made a reservation for Friday night

The atmosphere was great, with good tunes and a busy patio on a beautiful Friday night.  I noticed that it was a DJ spinning which is great for local DJs.  While the sidewalk isn't huge, they make good use of it with the patio in the heart of downtown.

Our waitress was great, especially considering how busy it was on Friday night.  She was perky, attentive, made good suggestions and really knew the menu.

We started with the fresh mozarella again - this is an absolute must, it's so fresh and tasty.
I ordered the summerlicious menu:  Panzanella Soup, Potato Parmesan Crusted Snapper, Tiramisu.  My boyfriend ordered the Pomodoro pizza.

Everything was delicious.  I took the Tiramisu home b/c I was so full after the mozarella, soup and snapper.  The pizza was incredibly tasty.  It comes in an oval shape which I thought was interesting - the waitress explained that they hand stretch all of the dough and the really cool pizza scissors are imported right from Italy.  

When I went to the bathroom I noticed there was a nice private balcony area upstairs - perfect for private events.  

I was thoroughly impressed with the customer service.  The manager came to introduce herself and comped our meals and one drink.  She came back after our meal to make sure everything was up to our standards and thanked me again via email the next day.  

5 stars Scaddabush, you have completely won me over."}
{"text":"Nicely situated in the Aura condominiums, which makes for a pretty convenient location for folks who are coming from the Eaton Centre.  Met up with a group of 10 other friends for a dinner and got to sit in a corner of the restaurant that was relatively quiet for all of us to have a conversation.  The waiter was very attentive and took the time to explain things on the menu, as well as answer any questions we had about the portions.  I got the baked carbonara and a tiramisu for dessert - both were very good!  The tiramisu was a bit heavier (dense) than I expected, so I was stuffed by the end of the dinner. :p

Overall, great ambience and food.  Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice decor.  The pasta was much better than expected, but the chicken and goat cheese pizza was inexplicably drizzled with chilli oil (which was not in the menu description) rendering it inedible.  They swapped it for a meatball sandwich which I had to get to go because the rest of our party was done eating long before it arrived.  I'll give this place one more shot, but will never order pizza again.. really dislike leaving a restaurant still hungry."}
{"text":"I've been to scaddabush twice.

Ambience: Modern, but with a rustic feel. Liked the candelabrum on some of the tables. It's two levels and you can book large parties upstairs. There's a bar area with a fair number of screens to watch sport games. I really like the music there. The DJ plays 90s throwback, which is awesome in my books! The main washrooms are upstairs and there is one accessibility washroom  on the main floor. Reservations are easy to make online through open table. 

Service: I had pretty good service both times. The first time, the service was slower, but we were there at a busier time. Servers are knowledgable and tells you what the specialties are without you asking. If you are sharing pasta, they split it up in two bowls, which I always like! Very detailed oriented. B+ to A

Food: scaddabush is known for their fresh mozzarella cheese, pasta, and meat balls. 

Today, we tried:

Prosciutto mozzarella - the combo together with bread, fig jam, and mozzarella was pretty good. The mozzarella was very fresh and chewy. I found the mozzarella pretty tasteless on its own, but mozzarella normally does not have a lot of taste. B

Capri pasta: seafood tomato pasta. The mussels are fresh and there's a lot of seafood in the dish. the pasta is super fresh. The only issue was the pasta did not have much taste. The tomato sauce was watered down. Not too impressed, but pasta itself was great. I would buy it to cook at home. B

Primavera pizza: the pizza dough is very tender and soft. However, I found the pizza a bit tasteless. I don't like olives, but the Olives gave the pizza flavour, which was good. B 

Mojito drink: it was ok. A bit too sour for my liking, but the drink has orange it in so it's supposed to be sour.

Overall, i wouldn't say the food had a lot of flavour, but it is definitely fresh. Overall grade: B"}
{"text":"I went with my friends here twice for dinner and they consistently provided great service. 

The food is good. The first time we went, I tried the meatball spaghetti. I couldn't finish it. It was ginormous! Also, the meatball tasted undercooked. I like my steak medium rare so I have no problem with somewhat raw food... But the meatball had the consistency of a meatball being uncooked. I actually stopped eating to take a moment to check if it is cooked.  It was brown, or, well, it's a dark place, I wouldn't be able to tell even if it was red actually, so scratch that.  The point is, the meatball didn't taste cook.  

Like everyone is saying, get the charity bread! First time I went, I wanted to get seconds because I was sharing it.  By the 2nd visit, I got my own.

I also like the fact that for the pasta, you can choose your size, pretty much S, M, L.  If you're ordering appetizers, small is good for you, unless you are a hungry man/woman, then go medium.  I think large is meant for sharing.

Overall, go back there again again for the environment and the service."}
{"text":"Great food. The fresh cheese was awesome! So was pesto pasta. They customized to our needs. The tiramisu was super delicious as well. They served wine in a clay jug which was very unique.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"3.5/5

It's a nice restaurant at the ground floor of the Aura building. The service was good at lunch.

Tried the stuffed meatball. It was pretty good! Well seasoned and juicy. The basil on top added a nice fragrance. Accidentally ordered the app instead of the entree. 

Also tried the apple ravioli. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It just didnt work for me. For me I would prefer a buttery crispy type of crust but it was quite sweet instead. The caramel sauce was good but I think it would have gone better with a buttery crispy pastry.

Overall a solid place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this large, loud, dimly lit Italian resto. The verdict: Not bad, not fantastic.

True, I had super high expectations given all the positive word-of-mouth...also, every time I tried to make a reservation for an upcoming Saturday, they were fully booked. I ended up reserving a table a few weeks in advance, which just added to my expectations of greatness.

Homemade \"naked\" mozzarella - yummy but a little tough to cut through; not as soft/creamy as I expect fresh mozzarella to be. (However, bonus points for the dollop of jam and the generous pile of sea salt.)

Margherita pizza - so thin they give you special scissors to cut it! The pizza (flavours, crust) was just okay, nothing special.

Meatballs with fettuccine - the meatball was quite tasty; pasta was a bit forgettable. (Tip: For dynamite Italian meatballs try Seven Numbers uptown on Eglinton.)

On the plus side, the portions were very generous...my companion and I split the pasta/meatballs and they offered to divide the dish in the kitchen and serve it on separate plates (love that). When it arrived, it looked like two full-sized entrees.

Sangria is excellent.

TIP: Even though the address says Yonge St, the entrance is on Gerrard."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. We had the naked mozzarella for starters. It has a very fluffy taste and is great if you love Italian cheese. I'm not a huge fan. For the entrée I had the Capri pasta size small. It was a decent portion for dinner. I usually don't manage to finish pasta at restaurants but I was able to here. Seafood is very fresh. I really enjoyed the squid and mussles. The fettucine is so soft."}
{"text":"Food is good. We order meatballs pasta and seafood pasta I think, I forgot the name. And also we order garlic bread for donation, is so good. The decoration also really nice. The service is nice too. I like this place for hangout or family gathering."}
{"text":"Good food here, we started with the mozzarella, prosciutto and bread....you can't get it any fresher than this! Very tasty. I had the seafood pasta, I thought it was delicious and the amount of seafood in it was just right. My wife had a grilled chicken and tossed salad, said it was quite good. The place was packed, we had to wait 45 minutes but it was worth it. One thing though it's quite loud in the restaurant so it's difficult to have a conversation, also make sure you have a light on your cellphone because the lighting in the restaurant makes it quite difficult to see the menu. There were a few tables using their phones to light up the menu.
I'll come back here!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my family and the food was fine but our waiter was not too pleasant. The restaurant wasn't that busy so I couldn't understand why the waiter took extra long to wait on our table and was in a rush to take our order! He give us water alright but that's all we got, had to ask if we could get something other than that. I've gone to smaller and more crowded places and received better service than that, there was simply no excuse!"}
{"text":"Fantastic environment, good service and delicious foods. The appetizers are awesome. Love  them"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The ambiance, the setting, and the beautiful decor really make Scaddabush a lovely dinner destination. Their pasta is incredible, one tried the stuffed meat balls one and the pesto Alfredo. Also, the Sophia personal pizza is delicious, and their Charity Bread is a great appetizer (although VERY heavily loaded with oil and spices, so be warned!). One thing I've noticed is I always tend to get an upset stomach after eating here, which is understandable since none of the meals they serve is exactly \"light\". Very rich flavours, very oily/spicy, and overall delicious! Took a star off for what it does to my stomach, but you get the point."}
{"text":"Food was amazing ! I love that the \"charity bread\" app goes to a local charity, and was delicious. The drinks and food was good, service was good, our waitress was really nice and checked on the tables in her section, getting everyone what they needed BUT she could not hear because the music was too loud! The music was blasting and people were talking over the music, it was a very nice place but a loud atmosphere for an early Thursday night. I also love the decor, very rustic and unique"}
{"text":"My family was staying in Toronto over spring break and I looked on yelp to see what a good italian restaurant might be.  I was not disappointed in your reviews people.  It was delicious!  The fresh mozzarella was to die for.  We also got a pasta with chicken and that was delicious too.  My kids loved their meatballs.  We really enjoyed the ambiance and had great service as well.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just okay dining experience.

Came here for summerlicious for lunch with a group. Server was very friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. And I love the vibe of the restaurant - spacious and rustic feeling and clean. However, the food itself is a bit mediocore. The waitress said the meatballs were home-made so I ordered that (outside of the summerlicious menu). I was expected a bunch of meatballs but instead it was just one large one. Looked more like an appetizer and not a main. It tasted okay but definitely overly garlicky. The mains for the summerlicious menu were okay - no one at my table was too overly impressed with them. I did enjoy the desserts however (tiramisu and chocolate jar cake). 

Overall, I'd say this is a great environment for a date night but don't expect mind blowing food. The summerlicious menu for lunch is $18 so it is one of the cheaper summerlicious restaurants."}
{"text":"A casual Italian place, loud 80s music, exposed brick walls, warm wood tables... 

Appetizers were good & unique, better than the mains. 

Charity bread - soaked in garlic, yum 

Their two specialties: meatball and in-house made mozzerella. 

Straight-Up Meatball - baseball-sized meatball, nicely seasoned and densely packed, topped with cheese and foccacia at the bottom

Burrata - very strong smell and taste from the cheese itself and truffle cream. Couldn't taste the honey. Crostini very hard & crunchy. 

Butternut squash ravioli - fully stuffed with squash and cheese, al dente pasta, but wayyy too heavy for my liking with the rich cream sauce. 

Bianca Pizza - cool presentation served with scissors on the board but taste was meh. Crust reminds me of plain pita bread. Didn't have much taste except for tomatoes. 

Napoli pasta was better - fresh spaghetti, interesting texture. Tomato based sauce, slightly spicy, with basil, capers"}
{"text":"Came for the pre-opening tasting..
All the food was great
I didn't take enough notes."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends, the place is bit dark, crowded and loud but they play good music. Their giant meatballs on the spaghetti and their Butcher pizza is just AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few friends, with a slight hangover, so there is no drink review in here!!

We did like how we can make reservations, so we had a table at 2.00

Our server was fast and prompt.  I loved how she could give a good real recommendation, other than saying everything was good.  
She recommended the ROASTED FENNEL & SAUSAGE FETTUCCINE, my friend got the stuffed meatball sub, and another friend the chicken and avocado sandwich.
APPS: a salad, and polenta tots.

Tots were great, and my friend loved his Caprice salad.

My pasta was exactly how she described, full of flavour and with a touch of heat. Loved it.  The pasta was fresh WAY BETTER than Jaime oliver kitchen.

My friends all raved about there dishes too saying it was delicious.

The only thing was after our food came out, we rarely saw our server.  Our soda's was never topped off.  Such a strong start too from her!

I will for sure go back for dinner.  Lets see how a full meal service stacks up, with drinks and all."}
{"text":"The presentation, decor and atmosphere are nice, though a bit loud, but the food quality was lower than expected. First, it was very cold where I was sitting. Maybe that was my fault for not having a jacket when it was warm out. We ordered the Naked mozzarella appetizer - it was tasty but pricy. Later, the Cesar salad was almost inedible because the lettuce was old and dry.  For dinner, I ordered one of the pizza dishes. It came  with the crust still slightly raw in the center and the edges were anemic white. The \"marinated\" chicken pieces were dry and inedible.  The wife thought that her spaghetti and seafood was too rich and mediocre. After she was done, there was a large puddle of oil in her plate. 

The waitress was nice and helpful, but could not save the meal."}
{"text":"Its by far THE WORST ITALIAN RESTAURANT i've tried in my life. I dont recommend this place for anyone. I got the permesan chicken it was okay, i swear i had the same chicken at frankfurt airport and it tasted million times better. The pasta is completely bland, has no flavour what so ever! I have TRIED italian food all over the world and this one is the worst!!! The pizza has no tomato sauce on it.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR ANYONE! Its a waste of your money. Trust my obese experience. 

To be fare, server was amazing!"}
{"text":"Just a standard Italian place with standard Italian food. Dropped by here because Libretto was full and we wanted some pizza. 

Pizza here was alright. Instead of the normal circular pizzas, they like to do their pizza in a rectangle. I don't really prefer this because you end up with 4 corner pieces haha which no one ever wants to eat. 

Tried the fresh mozzarella which was great, and came with some oiled bread and salt and marinara sauce. It was around $13 for one ball that would feed around 4 people. 

Also tried their \"famous\" giant meatball.. which was only ok and way overpriced at $13 for one meatball which the server described as \"the size of a baseball\". It was definitely smaller than that.

Overall, it was just standard Italian food and I can't say I recommend it nor stay away. If you are looking for something to eat and have no other options then it's not too bad."}
{"text":"You guys! I'm still fingerling over their grilled cheese sandwich. I've told almost everyone I know about it. 

The grilled cheese had this thick, crispy, buttery bread; provolone cheese; prosciutto; and fig jam. It was AMAZING!!

I pretty much had a foodgasm while eating it and couldn't speak when the server asked if everything tasted alright.

I want to go back!!"}
{"text":"Jan. 2, 2018 it's a nice place and I heard a lot of ppl say they like it here. Also I've seen some of my friends snaps, they practically lived there in the summer. So finally I decide to go with a friend. The service was fast, we asked for a booth and got one immediately. It wasn't loud or noisy.. my friend had gone there a few times and he always orders the he same thing. But this time he tried something different.. he liked the pasta but wasn't a fan of it. I liked my burger it was good. I wonder what ppl consider the best dishes at Scaddabush"}
{"text":"Overpriced food for tiny portions. They were so understaffed I don't even remember what my server looked like cause he was running around so much. I honestly left this place still hungry."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Illinois and met an old friend that I hadn't seen for years for lunch.  He brought me a bottle of Johnnie Walker blue ( he needed the money).  But I digress.  Sat at the bar area for lunch.  I had an Italian burger and my friend had a shrimp pasta dish with a wine sauce.  My burger was good but not great.  It was also a tad messy which is to expected now days as they are putting a lot of stuff on them.  I believe it had a hash brown on it.  The balsamic vinegar mixed into the beef was a little overwhelming.  I guess they had to play the Italian part up.   My friend, who now lives in Hong Kong said the noodle dish was good.  He ate all the shrimp but left some of the noodles.  The service was great.  They were there but not in your face.  The lady that served us was pleasant and put up with two middle aged guys talking to her.  I'll go back and try their pizza next time."}
{"text":"Oooooookay, well that was an interesting night. So our server was Jay (at least that was what was written on the table), he was a great guy, super kind and very willing to take pictures for us as we were there for one of my friend's birthday.

The food was great: the chicken pesto pasta and carbonara was scrumptious, calamari was crisp (if a little too salty), and the burrata was tasty. 

Unfortunately, the place is lacking in cleanliness. All of the plates at our table were greasy and looked unwashed--one of the plates still had leftover garlic butter or mustard of some sort on it. We asked to get them replaced, but the server (not Jay) didn't come back with new plates so we were forced to eat the burrata straight off of the serving platter. When my pasta came, it was miiiighty delicious and creamy, but one of my chicken pieces was clearly raw and I had to spit it out into my napkin. I didn't make a big deal about it, because I was half done by the time I got to that piece and I figured I could just take it home and make do with the rest. 

While I still had a nice dinner with my friends, this place would totally be a regular go-to for me if they had just been a tad bit more...hygienic? I might come back and give y'all an update on this place in the future."}
{"text":"Came tonight with my boss and 23 coworkers, my boss had reserved practically the whole 2nd floor seating area for us. Our waiter Stevie was awesome, he was very tentative and helpful, quite the joker too I might add.

Appetizers ordered: Charity bread, mozzarella and calamari fritto.
Charity bread was sooooooooooooooooooooo good. The calamari was rather small well the rings were small, they didn't use adult squid for this LOL but it was still really good, the dipping sauce balanced the saltiness of the batter.

Main courses: Everyone kind of ordered whatever they felt like having so I don't know.
I got the Chicken Parmesan, the spaghetti was still a bit too hard for my liking, but I don't mind, the Chicken Parmesan itself was really good minus a few burnt bits. Very filling.

Drinks: Again, a variety was ordered so I don't know. I got the Peach Mango Bellini. For the first few sips, you don't really taste the alcohol until much later, but you get a strong hit of mango and occasionally peach. The drink itself was very satisfying and cooling plus you don't feel as drunk after having it.

Dessert: Again a variety was ordered, mostly cheesecake, tartufo and tiramisu though. The tiramisu was the best one I have ever had. The sponge cake was so evenly soaked in espresso and the creamy layers were light so you didn't feel guilty eating.

Definitely eating here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Coming here on a Monday afternoon we were politely greeted at the door, it wasn't too busy and our server was quite friendly. Everything was going well until we discovered everything was dirty. There was food remnants in the cups and glasses, the cutlery had hard chunks of food stuck on them, and the side plates were greasy as if they have been used already. Have worked in the restaurant industry, this was totally unacceptable. My Italian Burger was decent, but the rosemary fries were super salty, I needed a drink of water. Oh wait...there other food in there...I was not impressed with this Scaddabush. My opinion of the Scaddabush name is torn between great and terrible since I did have great experiences at the Richmond Hill location. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"A standard Italian restaurant. Service is generally slow, my dishes usually take more than 30min to arrive. The food quality is very inconsistent(for me at least). I usually get the brick chicken, sometimes it tastes like heaven and other times the chicken is just as firm as cardboard boxes."}
{"text":"Second time visiting Scaddabush, this time not during the winterlicious craze!
I have to say that this was a much better performance on behalf of the kitchen and the staff. We were a large group of about 20, which was not a problem for them. There were a large quantity of appetizers from chicken bites, to spinach dip, and the charity bread. I do recommend ordering the mozzarella with fig jam and proscuitto. All in all an excellent selection.
My main was the stuffed meatball which I HIGHLY recommend. It has a delicious flavour with the species and herbs and is extremely well cooked.
The spaghetti which it was served on was not too spectacular, but nevertheless complemented the meatball.
Dessert was the chocolate panna cotta which to be honest, was not what I was expecting. A bit more chocolate would have made this dessert a bit better, while the biscotti which accompanied it was really not good. A colleague had ordered the cheesecake which was light and had a fresh berry sauce...a much better choice.
I would come back here for a quick bite or maybe a dinner before another event, but wouldn't plan to attend this for a culinary experience."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant and I high recommend this place, the service always great the food is fresh and amazing and great atmosphere and great price and it's cool to hang out with friends and family!!"}
{"text":"I went there again.
Full disclosure: they gave me a gift card to come back due to my last bad experience since the last review I posted. 
Since then I was not keen to go back there.
Finally we decided to give it back a chance.

The server Joel C was amazing. Great customer service skills. Well mannered. 
Water was cleaned compared to last time. 
He offered to bring me some lemon with my water since I wanted to drink water only.I find that was really nice of him to have offered that. Not everyone does that.

We took pesto pasta- well made taste was on point.

Took sophia pizza- taste was blend. Not so great for a pizza. That's why the 4 stars.

My favorite tiramisu I fell in love again with their tiramisu. It was freshly made ( yes I know when it's freshly made since am a fan of it). Taste was super on point. This is the tiramisu that made me go back to go to their place all the times until my last bad experience"}
{"text":"I've had Scaddabush on my radar for a while now. With limited choices on Labour Day, it seemed like a good time to try it.

After looking over the menu, my friend and I decided to share a couple of appetizers and a pizza. The Osso Bucco Bites seemed very appealing. Our server said the Cripy Polenta Tots were good, and we chose The Butcher, a meat lover's kind of pizza. We also ordered an Italian beer, Birra Moretti L'Auntentica.

It didn't take long for the apps to show up. The presentation of the Osso Bucco Bites was pretty. The inside of the bowl was red, with chunks of fried meat sitting on top of the papardelle chips. Although it tasted good, don't let the fancy name fool you. At any other restaurant, this would probably be called deep fried rib tips with wonton chips. I'm not sure how they related this to osso bucco. It's like no osso bucco I've ever had.

The Crispy Polenta Tots was a bit of a disappointment also. The tots were a bit small, and served sitting in tomato sauce on a relatively flat plate, with spoons. Hmmm. It wasn't that crispy because it was sitting in the sauce. Maybe it would have been better to serve the sauce in a bowl as a dip, keeping the polenta tots crispy. The sauce wasn't bad. I would have had it on pasta. Maybe it's the same sauce.

The pizza arrived before we finished our apps so the table became quite crowded. It was served on a wooden plank with a pair of scissors to cut it. That's a first for me. With a name like The Butcher, it had three kinds of meat, roasted garlic, red onions, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. It was very good but I wouldn't have minded the crust being cooked just a little bit more. My friend ended up picking off some of the garlic but I love garlic so it was fine with me.

It was my first time having Birra Moretti L'Auntentica Italian beer and it wasn't bad but now I know I prefer Peroni, another Italian beer. 

The service was good. The timing and temperature of the meals was good. Our table on the patio on this beautiful day was very nice. We didn't venture inside. At $65, with tax and tip, however, it wasn't a cheap lunch. I would have to think twice about coming back because I don't think it was a good value."}
{"text":"Came with a larger group on a random weekday for dinner. The ambience was cozy and rustic, with dim lighting, wood accents and a candelabra at the table for light. They promptly seated us and our server was great the whole time. She explained everything thoroughly, introduced the house specialities (house-made mozzarella, house-made pasta, house-made meatballs), gave us plenty of time to decide and was just generally helpful during the whole night. The service was truly excellent. 

I'm not sure about the food exactly. Our whole table ordered different things but no one was blown away by anything exactly. I myself had the classic meatball, which comes as one large meatball in a small dish sitting on top a piece of bread soaking in tomato sauce. It might not look like much, but it was a heavy dish that was quite filling.  Although good, I don't think I will be ordering it again even though it's their speciality."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, spacious seating and generous portions. The hand made mozzarella, pesto chicken pasta, and pizza are great! However their tiramisu didn't have enough lady fingers and was too creamy."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate our daughter's birthday last weekend and had a 3 course meal. The waitress was a boisterous type who was over enthusiastic to the point of getting on your nerves. We have been to the place a couple of times before and as usual nothing to complain about the food. We had the chicken pesto fettuccini, shrimp spaghetti and Zucca Ravioli and mozzarella. 

While reserving we had mentioned about the birthday but we soon realized that the server/s did not know about it. So before the desert I sneaked away from the table and told the waitress about the birthday and requested that when she brings the desert to bring the sparklers out. To our horror she came to the table and said happy birthday to her and spoilt the entire surprise. 

To top it all, after much confusion- taking our desert to the next table and then bringing for half the table , and then finally the sparkler came and this time there was no \" happy birthday\" from the waitress. Altogether an evening worth forgetting. 

We will not be going to scadabush any time soon!!"}
{"text":"Had a late afternoon lunch with work crowd so it was fairly quiet and service was prompt. I thought the prices were decent and portions appropriate. Liked the cozy feel to the place even though it's a huge restaurant. 

We loved the food! Started with some sharing plates. The crispy polenta tots were my favourite - flavourful creamy goodness! We also had the fried artichokes & cauliflower and avocado bruschetta. Both were good. 

For my main, I ordered the shrimp spaghetti. It was the best meal I've had in a while. Pasta cooked perfectly el dente. It had a really subtle, but unique flavour - a wine cream, lemon and garlic butter, poor man's Parmesan, fresh basil... there were also little balls of something, which I guessed were deep fried capers though I can't be certain. I don't think they were in the description on the menu. Either way, they were light and salty - a nice touch.

I will definitely dine here again, and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and it did not disappoint. Started with the in house mozzarella with balsamic so yummy! 
Went with a group of 6 they were able to accommodate and the service provided by mike was pleasant and courteous he even sent out champagne with sparklers for our anniversary which added a special touch. Overall great atmosphere it is loud but the food is mouthwatering  try the butternut squash ravioli or anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a group of 8 people. It was around 7:30 PM on a Friday night and we had NO reservation. We just showed up to this area and tried to call all the restaurants nearby for availability (bad plan I know).

Anyways, this place offered to seat us in 10 minutes which we didn't really believe, but we were seated in about 15 minutes at the Chef's table!

Our server Tristan was polite, friendly and accommodating to all of our requests. We ordered a variety of things, and everyone was happy with what they ordered. Had some Italians with us, and while they wouldn't say the place was amazing when asked, they said it was not bad. One issue was no free bread which the Italians didn't take to.

The mozzarella that is made fresh every day is really light and refreshing. I ordered a burger (yes, I know at an Italian restaurant), but it had elements of Italian food in it so back up. Any hoo, it was delicious and messy.

At the end of our meal, we had what looked like an Italian timbit donut like thing with chocolate sauce to dip it in. We were told that when you sit at the Chef's table, that dessert is free.

I'd go back definitely, great experience and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife's aunt and uncle in law (George and Terry) we were invited here and we were extremely pleased with the service and the food quality. 

We had the menu specialties. I loved the mozzarella and the American pizza.

This is my kind of a place."}
{"text":"Honestly, where do I even begin... Scaddabush used to be great, but now food is bland and service is terrible. I've gone 2 times in one month and both visits have been bad. On a slow Thursday night, we weren't given water to begin with and no follow up regarding food, drinks or dessert. Our server j.mac took forever to give us our receipt, and then get a machine and a take out box. There was a lot of potential for a great meal that night but the service was horrible. 

On a slow Sunday night, my friends and i waited over 45 minutes for food... why???? Idk. I ordered a salad. Friends pizza and fries were too salty. My friend killed a bug on the table as well. Ew. And the server was rude towards those who did not tip well. 
Definitely won't be coming back here ever again, which is a shame because I actually like some of their pastas and have been a customer since they opened."}
{"text":"The lobster spaghetti was very delicious. I always enjoy their freshly made pastas. I love the chewy al donte texture, and the way they grate the cheese and grind the pepper right in front of you when the dish is served. Even though Sacaddabush is a corporately run chain, the quality of their food doesn't feel that way. Their customer service is great even when the place is packed. I had a good experience at this location and will be looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I go to the Scaddabush at Highway 7 frequently and the downtown location occasionally. Now there's one near my home at STC and I'm so happy!!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!! 

The hostess girls are cute and wonderful to deal with. The servers are well trained and professional. The bartenders are extremely kind and the drinks are amazing! 

The food is so good. Get anything with mozzarella in it!  Obviously you go there for the fresh mozzarella.... 

.... And the PokeStop there :)"}
{"text":"The lobster spaghetti is my favourite Scaddabush dish. I usually go to the one on Front St but I was in the area with some friends so we stopped here. Ambience is nice and is mostly families. The fresh mozzarella is great as usual. Servers are okay but are obviously inexperienced (mostly college kids). Our server was a little too casual for my taste (forgot her manners at home - same with her enthusiasm). Decent place to dine if youre seeing a movie or shopping at the mall."}
{"text":"As a solo diner I came in on a slower lunch time with lots of open tables everywhere. The host seemed to have been annoyed at the fact I did not want to sit at a long bar table, as I felt a little uncomfortable and asked for a smaller one (not even suggesting a lower table as a possible option). 
I sat down and had a glass of wine and ordered a pasta (a very good sized portion considering it was a small). I had the Capri because I love seafood but to my disappointment found it very bland and almost sweet, which I do not enjoy in a savory pasta. I did ask for salt and had to add A LOT to bring out any sort of flavor, but I did enjoy the seafood.
My server was lovely and attentive, and after some dessert I left her a good tip however I hope the next time I come, I hope I am welcomed with a warmer reception and perhaps will order something different from the menu."}
{"text":"First timer in the restaurant and first impression was really good. Fancy restaurant with nice layout and a great patio. From there on, it was all downhill.

The group I was with decided to order a bunch of food. Calamari, mozzarella ball and meatball that I remember on top of my head. There's no need to name the rest of the order since all the food left no impression or good review from any of out friends. No taste, not enough in size, expensive for what it is. Did I say No taste everything tasted bland, as if they are trying to save on seasoning. 

The service was average, but not enough to return as customers. Not worth it, and should reconsider it's chef."}
{"text":"I ordered Parmesan (main) with the chicken and it was an $18.00 addition. Me and my boyfriend didn't see our server until I notified the manager. But I wasn't complaining because the place was unbelievably busy. He came to us, apologized, took our order and within 5 minutes our food was here. GREAT! However, I wouldn't recommend the charity bread because its so oily and the ingredients don't flatter each other."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but bad customer service. They don't bring out entrees at the same time, the other entrees get cold while you are waiting, they do not re-fill the water glasses. The pesto pollo barely has any chicken or sundried tomatoes, the pizza lacks a little flavor."}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience! Came on a beautiful Saturday evening and only had to wait about 10 minutes. Servers are extremely knowledgeable on the menu. They always ask if you've been before, because they want to be sure each guest knows about the amazing mozzarella and fresh pasta. 

Had the naked mozzarella, fonduta dip, and chicken parmesan. All were incredible and unique compared to similar dishes at other restaurants. Everything you eat at Scaddabush tastes homemade! 

A fun side note, they had an amazing DJ near the host stand playing music throughout the restaurant. He is incredible and creates a great vibe for a great Saturday night dinner."}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. To start we are trying out the meatball stuffed with cheese and bacon. For the main, I'm trying their chicken parmesan. Let's dive right into the review.

My girlfriend has been waiting forever to try this place again but wanted to wait for the coupons to come in the mail before going. A free appetizer? This must be good right? The meatball that came was filled with cheese and bacon. The taste was pretty good but the cheese was not well melted inside, so cutting into it the meat just fell apart while the cheese was insistent on staying in its sphere shape. I was most disappointed by the main dish. The chicken parmesan itself was good, but the spaghetti that came with it was so bland, I was for sure that the first time I made spaghetti (no name spaghetti with a jar or Ragu) tasted better than this. I tried adding a ton of pepper to try and revive it, but it was just way too bland to eat.

The service was good throughout the night, but our server did forget to bring us water when we asked for it :(

In terms of value, the meatball appetizer would've costed $15+. Good thing I had the coupon; I would not order such an expensive appetizer otherwise. The spaghetti here was also expensive, and I felt like the taste and quality of it did not justify the cost at all. The portion sizes we're also small which did not help justify the cost.

In conclusion, I would need to take into strong consideration when deciding on coming back even with the coupon. I expected so much more from this place. It is sad to see how the night turned out to be full of disappointment. That's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Price:
$6.85 Heineken 
$11.98 Naked mozzarella 
$15.93 Italian burger

I enjoy coming here for the environment, drinks, and mozzarella balls :) nothing else really. I've learned to stop trying their food because almost every time I try something new, it turns out boring and bland. If I were to choose a favourite though, it'd be Pesto Pollo"}
{"text":"Exceptional food taste and service. I was extremely impressed with the atmosphere and the way we were treated by our server. My only complaint was that the \"social\" size of the meal was not enough for three people. I left hungry.

Otherwise a true 5/5 place with amazing prices."}
{"text":"I've been here on numerous occasions and the food has never disappointed! The charity bread is a MUST.

I have had above average service every time I've come, except once where it could've been a bit better but the place was packed that night and it wasn't so bad that I would've seriously complained about it. All of the other times, the service was great.

The food.. I've had the Italian burger, the steak sandwhich, bruschetta, charity bread, stuffed meatball, panna cotta and all of it was quite good. 

It can get a bit noisy, depending on the time you go and especially if there are groups, so that's something to consider depending on what you are going there for. Also, I find that it's quite dark. Every time I'm there it seems like the lights get dimmed (even more) while I eat. Doesn't really give or take from my experience, but again just something to consider."}
{"text":"Quick update - I also dropped by to try the pasta and found my experience more or less the same. It's pretty good, nothing to complain about, but nothing special or unique by any means. Pretty much just more of the same -- what you would get at any other half-decent Italian place in the city."}
{"text":"I have a friend who loves this place and so with her recommendation 2 years ago I had my birthday lunch at a different location and I ended up not really liking scaddabush, which left me surprised because of how highly my friend talked about this place. I really did not want to give it another try because I felt like it was not anything special. However, a couple of weeks ago the same friend convinced me to give it another go and we decided to go to the location she always goes to, which was this one and give it another go. I am really glad I did because I enjoyed myself way more than the first time. The whole ambiance of this place was really awesome, staff was friendly and food was really good too. I forgot the exact name of my order but it was chicken pesto Alfredo pasta??? Something like that! Really delicious and the portion was perfect! After my visit, I will definitely be returning to scaddabush!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times the food was great!! However, the service could be improved..the wait time to order was ridiculouslyy long on the saturday night we went. But I would still give it 4 stars due to the quality of the food, atmosphere and friendly waiters. 

Word to the wise: if you go on the weekend for dinner, go EARLY to beat the crowds and save your stomachs from starvation!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe and the food! Their in house mozzarella is delicious! Most of their pasta and pizza dishes are good.. just wish they had better portions for the price. I like their shrimp spaghetti the best. Their wait times can be long so best to reserve on weekdays (they don't take reservations on Fri/Sat). Nice patio for summer/fall too! Always hard to find parking though. And last time I went I was disappointed in their toffee cake dessert. 

Tip: My go to dessert is always the tiramisu - it's truly creamy and fresh tasting!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing so many positive things about this place that I'm a little upset with myself that I didn't try it out sooner.

I came with a girlfriend today and wanted to eat out on the patio. I have to say I do like the decor of the place inside as well as outside. The patio ambience is stunning. Beautiful flowers planted everywhere with a rustic type of decor.

I was told that everything was made in house and fresh which I really liked. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and it was beyond delicious. I literally could have sat there for two hours and drank at least 5.

I ordered the spaghetti and meatball with the bruschetta (4piece) and a side fries. I didn't  find the spaghetti and meat balls that good. Sorry.. maybe it's because I make them myself and use my nonnas trusted family recipe?

The sauce didn't taste authentic at all.. tasted like chef boyardee to be brutally honest. The meatball wasn't seasoned too well either. It needed a heavy dose of parmigiano regiano and parsley and garlic, amongst other things.

The bruschetta was good. I would definitely order it again. I actually like how the crust is not hard but toasted softly. The fries were epic!! Never have I gone without ketchup and these fries are seasoned to perfection without needing any condiments! They come out fresh and hot as well!

Our server Julia was cool. She didn't rush us and was friendly. I will definitely be back! I'm excited to explore the menu. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be back to try any Italian food but I am definitely going back for a burger and daiquiris!!"}
{"text":"We reserved a table for a big party and our reservation was processed for the wrong time. After a little we still had a table as the restaurant was not very packed. we got water to the table and were able to order some drinks. We waited for some 20 minutes, which was probably the fastest drink delivery of the night. After getting some appetizers to share, which were okay, some more of our party arrived. The wait got longer for every drink and we were told that the bar was backed up, which was not our exact impression. We even had to clean up the plates from our table as nothing was happening. Miraculously, ordering three bottles of champagne sped things up for a minute. Guess it's worth the expensive stuff. To date, after 3 hours in the restaurant half of our group has not been asked for main orders yet. The other half is about to get to the kitchen and bar to help out"}
{"text":"We came here for a get together with my residence friends. Everything we ate was scrumptious and the presentation was absolutely amazing. They not only do a very good job with plating, but balance the colors and flavors to perfection. I also really like the ambiance of this place, with its exposed walls and dim lighting - it really is a great place to take a date for a tête-à-tête. I much preferred the seating arrangement and how it gives you an entire view of the restaurant.

To start, they brought complimentary focaccia bread with butter. For Appetizers, me and four of my friends shared Spinach and Artichoke dip and Chicken Parmesan bites. It wasn't enough for us but we were in for a surprise regarding the pasta serving. We ordered large Pesto Pollo to split between two of us. They willingly spilt it into two different plates and the serving was enough to fill us up. The flavors were so perfectly balanced - both in terms of texture and taste.   

The only reason for three stars was our waitress. She was lazy and not bothered to serve us on time. She was also super slow and would have deserved a better tip if she could be a bit more friendly.

Nonetheless I might come back to try the food again and I am hoping the service will be better. Maybe it was one of the places that's a hit and miss with service."}
{"text":"Food:  3 stars
Ambience: 1 star
Service: 1.5 stars

Our search for a decent pasta in Scarborough brought us to Scaddabush on a hot Saturday evening.  As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by at least 3 staff that were crammed in the narrow doorway.  

The restaurant itself had a very confused (eclectic, if you want to be nice) decor which translated into many other aspects which I'll get into later on.  We were seated in a bar section in a booth that was just a little too tight to comfortably get in and out of and the rail at the bottom of the banquet seating definitely would have posed a hazard to someone wearing high heels and not paying attention.  You could see the remnants of Jack Astor days very evidently here with rows of TVs facing our table. 

Since we had already read the reviews/menu, we ordered our appetizers first and browsed the menu for the mains.  As we waited, it was already uncomfortably warm in the restaurant.  When asked, the server replied that the A/C was on full and that she felt the heat more as she was moving around.  A curious response, indeed.  

Our server promptly returned with our bottle of wine and 2 visibly dirty wine glasses that I had to point out for her to bring new ones.  Our appetizer arrived and I was shocked to see the size of their signature meatball (just about 5 cm in diameter).  Sure, it was larger than most meatballs you encounter but at $13 a pop, I thought there would be more to it.  The meatball itself was flavourful but on a salty side and I'm pretty sure I won't order it again at $13 per meatball.  The bomba burrata was a much better dish with the creamy burrata swimming in a generously chillied tomato sauce.  The accompanying bread wedges were too oily for my liking and it was annoying to have to wipe my hands every time I reached for my glass of wine in between sampling the burrata.  

We had decided on the fettucine capri and a sirloin for our mains and funny enough, a doe-eyed waitress came by with a peppermill and some cheese before the mains even came out and asked us if we wanted some.  Uh...no...there is no food on our table, don't you see that???  

Fettunice capri came was generous in portion and I was happy to see that they were using fresh pasta.  The accompanying tomato sauce was also good and kudos to the kitchen for not over-cooking the seafood.  The gremolata that came atop the past was a little too coarsely chopped but it was fine.  But the real sour point was the lack of attention paid to the pasta noodles itself as there were too many parts of the pasta that were stuck together in a chewy clump.  My husband's sirloin was flavourless and cold as if it had sat in the kitchen while my pasta was being made.  Cold steak is not a yummy steak.  

Food aside, Scaddabush really needs to decide what kind of establishment they want to be as there was music blaring way too loudly the whole time we were dining.  It was hard to have a conversation without leaning across the table.  As we were leaving the restaurant, I saw a DJ standing next to the front of the house as people were seated uncomfortably in a row of chairs waiting for a table.  

Overall, Scaddabush experience was just that; \"a little bit of everything.\"  Food wasn't bad albeit some execution issues.  The service and the ambiance is where they really felt short and if I wanted to drop $140 for a pasta dinner, it'll be elsewhere for sure."}
{"text":"Went in to have a few drinks with my girlfriends. Server was great, really personable and on top of things for the most part. We ordered beer and a cocktail- saw a few bellinis come out and they looked incredible. I had a Ceasar salad (WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC IN THE SAUCE) and bruschetta. Very good quality overall, salad was editable with lots of cheese. Friend had butternut squash pasta (very good) and we saw the pizzas come out for another table - those looked really great too. Definitely coming back here again - wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a Italian restaurant around the hotel we were staying at and we spotted this one while browsing through Yelp. We were very satisfied with the service and the quality of the food. We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant easy going place to eat great Italian food."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 3 but if I could give it a 3.5 that would
be the real rating.

Got seated at a booth but the lighting was extremely dark as if the bulb was dying. Had to ask for a candle because it was difficult to read the menu. The dim setting makes the dining area a little more intimate though. 

Ordered the seafood pasta dish and my friend got shrimp spaghetti. To be honest it did not taste as good as it looked. I was excited for the mussels in my dish because it's one of my favourite seafoods but overall the red sauce was a little bland. The parmesan made the dish taste a little more flavourful.

My friend originally wanted spaghetti and stuffed meatballs but when ordered we were told that they were out of that dish. The spaghetti and shrimp came with a white sauce and I thought it was better tasting than the seafood pasta I got. 

3.5 because it's also a little pricey for chain restaurant food, 25-30 per dish and my dish being bland."}
{"text":"Last day of clinical- lunch out with the group. Went to Scaddabush as per recommendation by a frequent diner here. Well, to reiterate that I am not a fan of Italian food, I still went to try the Spaghetti with the classic meatball.Pasta was cooked al dente, tomato sauce was not sour. It was actually good, I must say. However, I think it was quite pricey for this dish, not even a slice of bread or salad to go along with it. Anyways, it had been a good experience."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while after watching a movie at the Cineplex there. It's a decent option when you're looking for somewhere to grab a bite in the area. I've tried various options from the menu - the chicken parmesan, the egg and bacon pizza, etc. Everything is typically good."}
{"text":"My gf and I came here today to eat at the patio and enjoy the nice weather. We were told that there was a bit of a wait and the party of 2 in front of us were first in line so we decided to wait at the bar. As we waited, we had ordered some drinks and noticed that not only had the party ahead of us had been seated but a couple who had just arrived at the bar after us had been as well. My gf questioned it and was told that they were here well before us, which doesn't make sense since they arrived at the bar to wait after us. Needless to say, we promptly paid for our drinks and left. No need to lie when a mistake has been made. Horrible service, it's a shame since we have dined many times prior to this experience."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and would go again. Tried their meatball appetizer, charity bread (literally money goes to charity), pesto chicken pasta, margarita pizza (which is served on a wooden plaque with a giant scissor), and other pasta dishes. Good place to go on a Friday night or for dinner during the week. Expect line ups if you go at busy times, i'd suggest making a reservation before hand!"}
{"text":"There's finally a good option at Scarborough town besides the same old offerings! This place has great food, amazing ambiance, huge portions, nice cocktails, and fair prices. If that's not enough for you then the nice patio with cute string lights will make you summer night.

The ouzo bucco bites and charity bread the stars of the show. The charity bread was warm, fluffy and delicious, and bites had a spicy sweetness to them. The pasta was good too, but honestly, skip it and order more apps instead. They're shareable, taste better and go well with cocktails. 

Honestly, it's difficult to find fault with this place. Swing by next time you're in the hood."}
{"text":"Only two things really stand out for me here: Mozzarella and the service. We had the prosciutto one, and that was a delightful combination with the fig jam and the crostini. Other foods were not so great: Meatballs were dry, spaghetti was bland and overcooked, the pizza did not have a crispy bottom at all and just fell apart upon eating, and the butternut squash ravioli was chewy. The service was amazing though, even though it's super loud (more on that later), they'll come and check in on you. In our case, they made a grievous mistake with our meal and apologized graciously. It's also kind of weird eating and trying to talk over super loud music - I just feel bad for the poor girl supposed to be the DJ. No one is dancing except her, and she stands in the front just dancing to her own music. Awkward."}
{"text":"After my review I was called by management and they took my yelp review seriously. I have to say thank you very much for contacting me and I am very impressed with the service that was given to me. Kudos and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of another high end casual yuppy bar, similar to a Milestones or Joey's, so reallly a dime a dozen in terms of food and action.

Huge premise, and while I waited for takeout, as my colleagues just couldn't eat anymore but needed some carbs just before midnite lol.

Look at these pics; I ordered small portions for both appy salad and main...but this could feed 2 people comfortably.  Ordered the fettucine pesto cream sauce with deleesh sun dried tomatoes and chicken.  I'd ordered this again.

House salad was to be expected, fresh and tasteless haha.  Some candied pecans or fruits would have neen nice but defeat the purpose.

Waited at the bar, took long IMHO.

Amex good.

Great place for big groups and a happening time."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a few friends and my bf before we went to an escape room place. I had the polenta tots and bomba burrata to share and the meatball and spaghetti as my main. 

The polenta tots and bomba burrata were delicious and I would def get them again if I come back. The meatball was good too but I wanted to try the stuffed meatball which they were out of unfortunately. However, the spaghetti was the real issue. It was kinda clumped together and I wish it had more sauce or salt or something which would have made it better since it was pretty bland. The portion was big and both my bf and I didn't finish our plates so we packed it home then added some salt and finished the rest later that night. The Asian in me would never let food go to waste especially since all it needed was a little salt. 

Service was alright. Even though there wasn't that many people, we had to ask to refill our water a couple times and had to flag down the waitress to order but she was very nice. Maybe just short staffed? 

If we come again, I don't think I'll get the spaghetti and meatball again. Maybe meatball straight up and those apps for sure."}
{"text":"Was recommended to eat here by a friend and I have no regrets! They have a variety of foods to choose from and you have the option of choosing a small or regular portion size. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. Overall, great dining experience."}
{"text":"One of the mussels in my Capri was uncooked. It tasted so raw so I spit it out. 
The chef \"explained\" it was a lobster that accidentally fell into my dish..

I didn't even bother to argue with them if they could possibly come up with this excuse. 

I have been to this restaurant for several times since it was closely. 
And every time I visited, I regretted afterwards."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night with the girls for my bday. It wasn't too busy as a weekend would be. Our server was super nice and friendly with jokes. Italian guy w accent - sorry I forgot to get his name.  Ordered the butternut squash ravioli, polenta tots, charity bread, pizza, and chicken parm which we all shared. The best was the ravioli and polenta tots! Pizza was good nothing to brag about, if had better at Liberetto on Ossington Ave. But it wasn't bad! Same for the chicken parm. Will go back for more ravioli! Oh and the goat cheese with beet salad was amazing - big portion!"}
{"text":"Great place server was a beautiful young girl with excellent customer service skills . I am in the restaurant industry & some of these younger servers just don't have what it takes ...however this one was a diamond she really impressed me & my family ... she had long black hair very pretty African American young lady... wish I got her name believe me she needs to be on your front line 
She is a fabulous server my experience in this business is that if more servers were like this young lady more places would be successful ... it's not all about the food 

Food was great!!!!  However she made it so much better... 
Mozzarella balls are to die for & Omg the meatballs were so good
Gotta say I was very happy with this place... its a 5 star for me 
Will definitely be back & hope to have that server again.... she was on the ball"}
{"text":"Summerlicious at Scaddabush is definitely worth the money. 

I've always like Scaddabush for the atmosphere. It's very welcoming, with the dim lighting, vintage looking furniture and art. 

The pasta and cheese are made in house so pretty much everything tastes very fresh. I would say this is one of my favourite places to eat pasta. 

Because a friend and I shared, I got to try pretty much 2/3 of the summerlicious menu. I would definitely recommend the pasta (vegetarian), pizza fritta, tiramisu and strawberry Sunday. I also got the chicken limone but barely ate the chicken because it was so dry. That was the only downside. 

For $28, I think it was worth it because it's incredibly filling and the food is good. I ended up taking my dessert to go because it was just too much."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the cleanliness of this place.  The dishwasher needs to be cleaned and serviced.  All the water glasses on every table had specks of food on it and were all stained.  All the cutlery had food remnants left on it.  The table that I sat at was an oil slick when I placed my hand down and felt grease all over my hand.  All the side plates were greasy.  I was served a glass of coke that had specks of food floating around in it so I lost my appetite before my food arrived in what I hope were clean plates.  Food was okay.  Pasta was overcooked, but flavour was there.  Osso buco bites were delicious but chips underneath weren't crispy.  Mozzarella and pizza on point.   Table we sat at was like eating on a roller coaster as it wasn't level.  Took three wait staff to notice and fix for us.  Will I go back to this restaurant?  Not the Square one location.  Richmond Hill location is so much better overall so I will stick to that one."}
{"text":"pizza was great  meat balls good  pasta was cold service good have been better forgot to 
bring salad out till dinner is served."}
{"text":"Lovely place at yonge and Dundas. Cute ambience . Went here for my husbands birthday , although great for groups and the music was great it was a bit loud. The meatballs are amazing and the house mozzarella ."}
{"text":"Visited twice during opening week with a friend. Unfortunately, the vegan menu options were scarce (to be expected when dining at an Italian restaurant) but there were a few options for vegetarians.

We were huge fans of the avacado & goat cheese bruschetta and the focaccia crostini served with the spinach & artichoke dip was absolutely delicious.

Also, huge thumbs up for being the only restaurant I've come across to charge me $2 less for my entree after removing the chicken. Why don't more restaurants do this? 

My only complaint (and this is a big one) was the overwhelming amount of hovering and interrupting from the staff. My friend and I were interrupted several times by both staff and management, each time mid-sentence, to see how we were doing. Normally I would appreciate an attentive server, but this was simply irritating as we barely had a chance to lift our forks to our mouths for our first bite before being asked what we thought of the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Scaddabush twice since it has opened in Toronto.  The first thought I had when I walked in was how high the ceilings were, and I really liked that!

The staff there are very friendly and gracious. The atomsphere is quite loud once the place gets more busy, but there is also music playing in the background. There is a large seating area in the lounge and also additional seating for large  groups upstairs.

They are known for their fresh mozzarrella and their giant meatballs. The fresh mozzarrella was amazing. However, the meatball has been consistently very salty (stuffed and non-stuffed). Also, I believe their pasta is supposed to be fresh, but the last time I went, the spaghetti tasted like it was from dried pasta, so I was a bit disappointed there. The first time I went, the spaghetti was chewier and tasted more like fresh pasta.

We also had their white and red wine sangrias which were delicious. You can order them by the pitcher as well. No drinks specials on Wednesdays though, FYI.

I would probably return if I was downtown with friends and we didn't want to walk further to another restaurant.  My main issue with this place is the saltiness of the food."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.... our table ordered the meatball sandwich, stuffed meatball, garlic bread and two kinds of pizza. Everything was great especially the meatball. We was there to celebrate my husband graduation and they brought him out a chocolate cake thing to celebrate which was a nice surprise. The cake was really good!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday afternoon after I heard nice things about this place. After we entered the restaurant we were seated. It was not busy at the time and there were many workers on the floor. Fifteen minuets later, no one came to our table. I was quickly loosing my appetite and was very frustrated that none of the servers came to take our orders not even give us water. There were many servers and bartenders socializing while we waited for someone. I find this very unprofessional and rude. Probably around 20 minuets after someone finally came to our table. 

Other than the service the food was good, it would have probably been better if i didn't lose my appetite at that point. I would probably would not come back to this restaurant due the slow service. If the service is slow during the day, it will prob be even so during the night."}
{"text":"Friendly service with beautiful decor with very average food for the price. We ordered the spinach dip and artichoke dip which was decent. Then for main course ordered the Zucca Ravioli with charity bread. The bread was VERY oily and did not taste good."}
{"text":"A hyped up Applebee's

Went there with work colleagues, nice vibe, friendly courteous staff, got seated very quickly.  The menu is pretty sparse, they call it an italian restaurant but if serving Pizza and a few pasta dishes qualifies as an italian restaurant then my local bowling alley is an italian restaurant. 

The Pizza was okay, nothing to do cartwheels over, but decent and tasty. The appetizers are average as well, fried calimari and buffalo mozzeralla are hardly unique. The pasta was a big disappointment because they obviously make their pasta in house and it is very good, its al dente, has good flavor and texture, however they don't do anything with it. The choices are spaghetti with meatballs, penne with chicken cutlet, macaroni and cheese. What a waste of good home made pasta. Do something with it, make a dish out of it that showcases the quality pasta. No imagination what so ever.

Overall its a decent place to have a few drinks and some pizza when you've got the munchies. But its no Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I eat out a lot, and I mean a lot.  

I came here with my mother last night (an out-of-towner), and was not expecting much at first.

Firstly, the service.  I forget the name of our waiter but he was absolutely fabulous.  Energetic, bubbly, and very knowledgeable about the menu and the concept of the restaurant.  Everything he recommended was delicious.  He was more than willing to let us sample a couple of wines before we committed to the entire bottle. 

We started with the Prosciutto mozzarella and the stuffed meatball, both of which did not disappoint.  The mozzarella was fresh and the accompaniments were on point.   Sidebar: one of the best meatballs I have ever had, it was positively sinful. 

I had the Chicken Limone and mom had the Zucca (butternut squash ravioli).  Both were to-die-for, but the Zucca stood out with the crispy sage and cream sauce. 

We finished by splitting the Tiramisu, which I am not normally a fan of, but it was excellent. 

All in all, a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 mains, and 1 dessert for $120 is quite a steal considering the location and quality of the food. 

Will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor, very social and open with the wooden tall chairs and dim lights..,it's too bad the food was mediocre, mussels tasted kind of funky and it was a bit too salty for my liking, also found the pasta to be all clumped up together, don't know if that means it's old or frozen pasta....."}
{"text":"We visited as 2 adults and 4 kids under 10.

Were seated right away , waitstaff was friendly and accommodating.

All food ordered was great favourite chicken and shrimp pasta.

Managers walked around to check on patrons.

Only wish appetizers were a bit bigger or they offered comp bread.

Great for families"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with this place. It's a chain (there's one in Square One) and it's in the new Aura building complex, so I wasn't sure what to expect... Honestly, a restaurant could be pretty mediocre and still survive here because of proximity to so many condos and hotels. But I came to try this place for dinner tonight, and even though they've only been open just over a week, they have their act pretty together.

The staff are great and there are a lot of them. It was a busy night, but everything was prompt. I was immediately greeted and welcomed upon walking in, taken to my table by a different person, and right away someone else came by with water. My main server was knowledgeable about the menu, offering lots of helpful suggestions. The 2 specialties here are the in-house made fresh mozzarella and the homemade meatballs, so I had to get those. Everyday they list the person who is making the mozzarella and the pasta. 

My DC and I had:
- Basil and honey spritz - a nice, fresh, gin-based cocktail. I loved the strong basil flavour. 
- Negroni - pretty classic, well done
- Burrata - a great sharing item, it comes with ample crostini and is drizzled in honey
- Classic Spaghetti and Meatball - one big meatball on top of nice al dente pasta in a flavourful tomato sauce with lots of fresh basil and fried garlic (there is also a \"stuffed\" meatball option, with pepperoni and mozzarella). The meatball was really juicy and tender, maybe a bit too soft for some, but I liked it. 
- Atomica Pizza (spicy sopressata salami, sweet peppers, red onions, pepperoncini, fresh mozzarella, San Marzano tomato sauce) - it was actually quite spicy and there were tons of toppings, with a nice crunchy texture. The pizza is thin crust and not too greasy. It was huge, so expect to have leftovers. 
- We didn't have room for dessert, but they have some yummy sounding options - mostly classic Italian desserts (panna cotta, tiramisu, tartufo).

The space itself is a bit loud, but not so much that you can't have a conversation. The atmosphere is casual and lively with a mix of top 40/motown music and TV screens over the bar playing sports. There is an upstairs area and a lot of long tables that could accommodate large groups. It's convenient to where I live and work, so I could definitely see myself coming back to try other items on the menu. Prices are reasonable and the quality of the ingredients is quite good.

{"text":"Amazing food! Loved their restaurant made mozzarella cheese. Had their calamari app. Loved the flavors. Main dish was their grilled chicken and shrimp with pasta. Was suppose to be a bit spice, but was more on the bland side. Had to add some salt to it. But all in all, not a biggy, food was still great and hot. 
There's a wide selection of drinks. They have a nice cool bottle of moscato, 

Very family and friends atmospheric. Would definitely head back, next time to dine in their patio."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife at the bar after being asked to wait 15 minutes for a table.  Bar service team was so friendly that we wanted to dine there. Food was great. Service was very good. Friendly welcoming bar staff.  Bruschetta excellent and both our pasta dishes were outstanding, Napoli & Capri with a meatball.  Meatball was awesome. Will be back on our next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I was impressed. They have my favorite cocktail (Aperol spritz) which is a huge plus for me. I really liked the spaghetti and meatball: something which I would never usually order, but the description of it intrigued me. However, the Apple Ravioli was to die for, and that made it all worth it for me. Service-wise I thought my waitress was nice but slow (I was there for an hour and a half, and most of the wait was to order and pay the bill). It was also on the expensive side, so I would have preferred slightly more attentive service. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for some good Italian-style food."}
{"text":"Ordered the sausage fennel fettuccine and a side order of their focaccia bread. The pasta was alright, a little greasy and cold. It's also a large portion for their normal size so I would opt for a small size next time. The house focaccia was not good at all... it was dredged in olive oil and seemed to be fried. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Now I know that Scaddabush is a chain restaurant but I honestly really enjoy their food! I've tried a few things on their menu on multiple visits (birthday parties, family meals, girls' nights) but my favourites include the avocado goat cheese bruschetta and the carbonara pasta. Today, my family ordered these two favourites along with the snapper entree, the Italian burger with rosemary fries and calamari. All were full of flavour and cooked perfectly. The server was nice and the ambience is always good. We'll continue coming back!"}
{"text":"First time here. It was okay but not at the same level of a Mom and Pop restaurant. Nonetheless, service was pretty quick, the patio was nice, the Margherita was okay (but not as good as Papa Giuseppe's in Port Credit). I will come back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience at SCADDABUSH. 

VENUE 4/5 

It's very nice inside, but it's your typical bricks, wood beams and exposed light bulbs decor. Not a big fan of the high chairs but they were comfortable enough. 

FOOD 4/5 

We shared the mozzarella Pingue prosciutto and man; it was good. The size is perfect for 2 people to share. We had enough fig jam and prosciutto to share between us. The cheese was delicious. You can tell it was fresh. It came nicely presented on a wood plank. 

I had the veal Parmesan served with spaghetti. Very good portion. The pasta were al dente and the sauce had a good kick. The veal was super tasty. 

SERVICE 5/5

Very attentive and yet not intrusive service. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable, funny and she looked like she was truly happy to be there.  

I had a very good experience and will definitely come back. The quality of the food and service is great and the prices are very competitive."}
{"text":"Quick service before our movie. Got the pesto pollo fettuccine, very good! Sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday so I brought her here for a birthday lunch. We started off with the charity bread with three cheeses. It's so nice that they are selling items for a good cause! The bread was delicious, a little fatty for my part but still the flavour was top notch! As a main I opted for the baked pasta carbonara. My friend had a pasta with tomato sauce and spicy cheese. Unfortunately, the pasta carbonara was not much to cheer for. It tasted bland, which makes me believe they are not using these delicious aged cheeses that a proper carbonara should contain. Additionally, there was not much pancetta in it, I had to really dig around to find the few pieces. My friend on the other hand said the food was delicious.  
The food was very filling so we asked our waitress to pack the leftovers for us. I tried convincing my friend she should have a sweet ending of her meal, afterall it was her birthday but she was too full so we instead asked for the bill. To our surprise, with the bill came a chocolate jar cake for the birthday girl, which was a very nice surprise. Apparently they do this for your birthday. We thanked our kind waitress and decided to try sharing this dessert. 
To summarise, I have been to this restaurant before and I've enjoyed both their pizza and pasta so I will probably come back again, however I will not order the carbonara. The waitress was friendly and service oriented, so a big shout out to her (Federica? Sorry don't know your name)! 3 stars for the food but overall 4 stars for the whole experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice - would be great for a casual romantic date night. Unfortunately, I went with my father. He had a hard time seeing the menu it was so dark. Our food was good but there isn't too much in the line of vegetarian options. I ended up pigging out and getting a grilled cheese without the meat and a side salad. It was good! My dad liked his meal, but said it was VERY garlicky. Bring some gum for after your meal!"}
{"text":"Ok.....I expected great things from this place, and was not too far off.  The food is beautiful and flavorful.  The atmosphere is vibrant and allows for great conversation and people watching.  The place seems clean and friendly.  The only negatives are that the service is slower than expected and the price points are a little high, but to be expected in prime real estate area.  I will go back soon and see if the service has gotten faster.  Otherwise this is a good date night spot."}
{"text":"We will definitely frequent this restaurant.  We set out for the evening with another restaurant in mind but due to a long wait we ended up at Scaddabush. What a lucky turn of events. The food was EXCELLENT!!!

The Bar staff were attentive and were very well versed with their menu. Usually a new restaurant suffers from disorganization but after only 5 weeks of being open they really seemed to be rocking along quite smoothly. 

Good luck Scaddabush and welcome to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"In Toronto first time and enjoying our anniversary. Thanks for the recommendation from the nice bar tender at The Duke of York. Definitely awesome food and totally friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went to Scaddabush yesterday for the first time. We ordered some drinks and charity bread to start. The charity bread was amazing. We at first thought the bread was too small but as we ate it we realized it was a good amount. I got the stuffed meatball over spaghetti. I thought the spaghetti was a bit bland...sadly. The stuffed meatball was good though. My friend had a seafood pasta which she said was good and another had the butternut squash stuffed ravioli. Good as well but not the best. The small size portions the waiter said would be like a lunch size but when those sizes came out they were so not lunch sizes! So if you're a light eater you might as well get the small. 

Everything was fine up until towards the end, the waiter seemed to have disappeared and every time I tried to flag him down he wouldn't see me or would be so slow. Like we were just sitting there drinking water. Annoying. Other than that I don't know if I would come back to Scaddabush for a while. It was decent but not one to rave about."}
{"text":"Great food, great company. For a chain italian restaurant, Scaddabush is highly recommend if you want italian food and do not want to take the risk of trying a new place! The decor is very similar to Alice Fazooli's.

The fresh mozarella here is amazing! I have only tried the prosciutto one but with the fig jam, sea salt and crostini, it is the perfect combination..you can always ask for more crostini free of charge.

The calamari fritti and spaghetti and meatballs are also delicious, the meatball is huge. 

I admit that Scaddabush is quite pricey but the food is great. The first time I came here, the server took my drink order but I guess he forgot, I never got my order and was not charged; that was kind of a disappointment as I was already halfway through my meal and did not want to bother.

The location is quite convenient as I was able to take the bus from Cooksville GO and get off right at the intersection (after work, from downtown); the parking lot also has tons of parking available."}
{"text":"It's loud! It's busy! But hey it's Mississauga and where else are you going to go?!

Really the food isn't bad. The fresh mozzarella is awesome. The pizzas are pretty good.  Love the freshly made pasta (go for the butternut squash ravioli). And definitely go for the charity bread to get your dose of good deed and garlic. Hope you aren't on a date night! 

Be prepared for a long wait on a weekend. But Chapters is close by and they will text you when your table is ready. Service is really good while you are there."}
{"text":"We were looking for an Italian restaurant and being that we are visiting we looked to yelp to find a place and ended up here.  Since we didn't get there until late after 10 we didn't want to order full meals so we got 3 appetizers to share as dinner.  Portion wise this was still more than enough.  We had the chicken parm bites, calamari and the buratta mozzarella.  The chicken parm bites were good bust basically cut up chicken fingers, the accompanying sauce which was amazing made them good.  The calamari was basic calamari but again the sauce was great.  The buratta was amazing.  I would recommend that dish to anyone.  It was so creamy and tons of flavor.  Only thing is that I wish the crostini had been hot.  Being that it was so late already we didn't want to send anything back for not being hot so I'll take part of the blame for that.  I wish that we had tried the meatball but we were going out for drinks after and didn't want to be stuffed and that thing looks quite heavy.  Now we definitely have an excuse to return to try the stuffed meatball and get the buratta again."}
{"text":"So very delicious we went for lunch and all three of our meals were amazing! We had the Italian burger, 2 tomato fennel soups and the polenta tots. All delish! I specifically was craving the hand made mozzarella which they don't normally serve until 5pm but the staff were so kind as to put an order in for us at lunch time! All the staff were super friendly. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience at this location. I ordered the stuffed meatball with focaccia and they were kind enough to give me extra focaccia. The meatball, which was stuffed with pepperoni and cheese, was delicious and something I've never had. The focaccia was also crisp and went well with it. My sister had the stuffed meatball with pasta and I had a sample of the pasta, which they say is handmade. It was al dente and tasted fresh. Overall I would recommend this place. It's nothing extraordinary but it beats other chain restaurants by providing something new."}
{"text":"First time here as part of a YELP event so was fortunate enough to get to speak to staff and understand the philosophy behind this new eating establishment.  Paraphrasing (of course) but in essence they wanted to create the \"traditional italian family meal\" vibe here in the GTA.  Everything from the way you are greated at the front door, to the family style seating arrangements and open workspaces echo's this vibe.  And they did.  Even on a Monday night the place was packed!  Ambiance is nice - although the music can be a bit overwhelming.  Great bar area for drinks and quick snacks, with tons of family style seating furhter in.

But its the food that really caught our groups attention.  Scaddabush makes their own Mozzarella and it is delish!  Tried it plain, with a tomato relish, and with a proscuitto/jam combo that melted in my mouth!  I am a sucker for anything cheese but this was truly a treat.

Next was the homemade meatballs - we got to taste them as sliders with the crunchiest/softest buns I have ever had. Looking on the menu they feature the meatballs in many forms (with pasta, as a main and even stuffed) so I  will have to go back an try that!

The pizzas were also great. We had a number of varieties but honestly? The Margarita was my favorite. Traditional (homemade) mozzarella, sauce and a bit of greens.  Didnt need anything else.

Although the restaurant is in the \"crazy\" area that is Square One, once you are inside you forget about all of it. The patio is also nicely done up with heaters so you can still enjoy the fall nights. 

Yelp events are always a blast and I can honestly say - if not for Yelp I would never have tried this place out.

I am super excited to make a second trip on my own to try out the full menu at Scaddabush!"}
{"text":"The arrabiata is always amazing here. The charity bread the last time we went was far too crunchy though. But we weren't too bothered because it's almost always really good. We actually had room for dessert this time and we had the cheesecake. Holy, it was incredible. The cheesecake was the perfect texture and it tasted so good.

It's become one of our favourites for date night."}
{"text":"TUTTI A TAVOLA  A  MANGIARE!  Any one who knows italian, knows Lidya Bastianic- I feel like she would give this place 5 stars.

I consider myself quite a lazy person when it comes to reviews.  So this should go without saying that I really enjoyed myself at Scadda Bush.  Here we go!

A chain restaurant with the charm and quality of a mom and pop.  

Service: is wonderful.  First step into the place you are greeted by the warm and charming staff.  They treat their patrons as family, with care and respect, I felt like I was back home in Italia.  We were greeted by the owner and and he brought us a plate of fresh house made mozarella and proscuito.  The mozarella was creamy and squeaky (fresh) and the proscuitto was tender, with perfect marbling.  Our server was fantastic, very kind and helpful.  The food is great quality for a great price.  As i said, the food hits home as close as it can to nona's.  I recommend the sangria-delicious. Not this watery tasteless merda that you would get at the keg, but properly mixed and juicy sangria.  Gorgeous atmosphere, perfect for friends, family and dates."}
{"text":"Came here the other night after reading tons and tons of Yelp reviews for Scaddabush. I have been avoiding trying this place because I personally do not think Italian food is worth it in more restaurants and its so cheap to make and that most restaurants don't give you nearly enough food for how much you pay. Pasta noodles are cheap and so is sauce so normally I see no point in going out and paying $20 for a plate of pasta that isn't even that filling. 

I ordered the and spaghetti and stuffed meatball. There was not nearly enough pasta as like I said earlier pasta is cheap so I feel like most restaurants should just throw some more pasta on the dang plate. It also only came with one meatball which was small in comparison to what I've got at other restaurants for less. I mean the food was tasty no doubt about it and on taste alone this is a 4 star place but I can't say I recommend Scaddabush as I think its super over priced for the amount of food you get.

The wait staff also wasn't the best I'm pretty sure our waiter forgot about us halfway through the meal because we were sitting there waiting for drink refills and then the bill for 20 minutes and we could see him just sitting at the bar. Not sure what thats about.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is good though, its between casual and dressy. Not as casual as Jacks but not as dressy as the Keg. Its similar to a moxies but Id personally rather go to moxies because I feel as the food is more filling for the price.

I probably will not be back unless a friend insist on going here for their birthday or something but I will not be back here for a meal by choice.

Tasty food but overpriced. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the spaghetti and meatball which was huge. The peno pesto pollo is highly recommended. Great place to celebrate my brother's birthday!

Great atmosphere, great food, and our server Mike was awesome too! He taught us what Scaddabush meant!"}
{"text":"Amazing music/vibe really set the tone for my visit here for dinner recently. The servers were nice (ps, warning, they do do stuff for birthdays but will charge you for the Tiramisu) and prompt. The pizzas were really good, a bit light on the sauce side but great if you want to avoid heartburn. The place is huge with ample seating and bar seating. It's casual enough yet fancy enough for a date or an outing with great friends."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for dinner. We often goto this restaurant but I have not reviewed it. We were a group of 5 that arrived around 5:30pm. Service was excellent but the wait time for food was unacceptable. The food came at about 6:30pm which was a lot longer than expected. Food quality was good, portions are fair and prices are fair. We are likely to come back but I don't have amazing recommendations for it."}
{"text":"Scaddabush always seems to be a pleasure to eat at. It's hard to get a table sometimes and it can be slightly overpriced...but for the most part it's worth it."}
{"text":"Their $2 charity bread and their meatballs are to die for. The rest of the food doesn't stand out too much from any other fine dining Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I brought a large group here for Winterlicious on an exceptionally frigid Thursday evening - this place fills up fast! The service was mostly good, but it seemed like we had to flag down our server a few times because she was so busy. We ordered the fresh mozzarella and I have to admit I was underwhelmed - it's kind of a chewing-gum texture and difficult to spread on toast. 

Overall, it's a fairly solid bet that a large group can all find a table (with reservations) and something on the menu for everyone. My friends all had good things to say about their experience - I'd come back again."}
{"text":"We were downtown and we decided to come here for supper. The decor and atmosphere is great here. The waitress asked us if this was our first time here and when we said yes she went on to describe every dish on the menu ( a bit too long). We ordered the Sophia pizza and the Napoli pasta. The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The prices were comparable to prices at other similar restaurants. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better restaurants I've been too. I've been a few times and tried something different every time. We came for a birthday once so we had a larger group, but the service was still great. My sister had ordered a pizza which took longer to come then the rest of the table's food. We didn't complain, but they comped the meals anyways. Pizzas are a good size. Charity bread is always delicious. Fresh mozza is amazing. Last time I ordered the grilled cheese and prosciutto which was fabulous with the fig jam on it."}
{"text":"Romantic, cozy, eclectic atmosphere?  Check.  Friendly, informative server?  Check.  Delicious, homemade food like nonna used to make?  Eh.  Not quite.

This place has been bookmarked ever since a Yelp event back in September!  And it was only today that I had a chance to check them out for a dinner service.

What was ordered:  Fresh Moz (Naked), Napoli Pasta, & Primavera Pizza.  

Fresh Moz (just under $11) - Highlight of the meal.  A definite must-order!  App came with more bread than moz though, so it wouldn't hurt to make the ball a tad larger.  Perfect to share between a coupla people!

Napoli Pasta (sm $14.28)  - I expected more from a fresh pasta dish.  Spaghetti was not fully cooked as noodles were stiff.  Not hard on the inside, but it could've used a coupla more minutes in the boiling water.  Also I'm not sure what it was in the herbs, but I was NOT a fan.  Maybe it was the salsa verde?  Too much basil?  All I know was that the seasoning was overpowering and slightly Asian, as opposed to Italian.  Also pool of oil at the bottom of dish did not help the situation.

Primavera Pizza ($14.79) - Alright.  Quite generous portion for price.  Not too much cheese and crust was not wet or watery like some veg pizzas at other pizza places.  Not a fan of the dough for the crust though.  I have had better pizza at Italian bakeries (Molisana).

If you're curious to check out Scaddabush, the environment is definitely enjoyable.  (It would probably be best to save some $dough$ and go for lunch, BUT fresh moz is not available 'til the evening.)  Despite the nice décor and friendly service,  I wouldn't expect too much from the food which is a shame!  I'm guessing that it would be perfect for a drink or two though."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I come here almost every time we have a girls night out. 

Majority of the dishes, we have all tried already. The only dishes that I clearly remember eating are the: charity bread, chicken parmesan bites and goat cheese & beet salad. 
Charity bread is amazing, we always have to get it when we go there. Most restaurants usually just have bread and butter or garlic bread. This bread, it's not too buttery (even though it says lots of butter) - it's the right amount. But the combination of garlic and rosemary, it's just fantastic. 
Parmesan bites, nothing amazing about it. The meat was a little dry that one time I tried it.
Goat cheese & beet salad was great. Normally I don't like goat cheese, but when it's combined with the beets, dried cranberries, pickled red onions, walnuts and the citrus vinaigrette - they all complement each other perfectly.

Oh and for you bellini lovers, the peach mango bellini is reaallllyyy good. The lemon rosemary bellini however... wasn't good.

All of the staff are enthusiastic and playful, if definitely adds to the atmosphere. Only thing I don't like about the place, is that it's so dark in the evening. We always need to take out our phones to see the menu.

Overall, love this place!"}
{"text":"Service was good. However, the pizza that was ordered was burnt on the edges an that it overpowered the taste of the dish. We didn't complain because it was a treat and that we didn't want to stay longer."}
{"text":"Scaddabush has a great ambiance but I've found that the food consistently falls short of expectations. 

If you're visiting, I recommend trying the charity bread, which is one of their signature appetizers. It's basically fresh bread with lots of butter. 

I had the Chicken Avocado BLT and while it appeared to be presented well, I found that it lacked any flavourful taste. There was also barely any avocado with the restaurant spreading a very thin layer. I opted for a Caesar side salad that tasted more bland and as if the dressing were no-name. (I would probably try the Garden salad if I were to go back)."}
{"text":"Busy, busy! Had a DJ spinning there on Friday night. It's a nice looking restaurant. I had the chicken parm. It was a pretty small piece of chicken and small serving of pasta as well. Flavour was okay. Kinda felt like the sauce was lacking a bit. I also would have appreciated a bigger slab of cheese! I wasn't really full at the end of it."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE scaddabush. My favourite restaurant by a long shot. Their caprese salad is fantastic. I order it every time I go with the addition of grilled chicken and the mozza to start. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"I came here for take out since I was staying at the hotel across the street.

Great first impression - outgoing and obliging staff. Nice ambience.

The problem is that I asked a simple question: Did you put cutlery and napkins in the bag? Employee said yes. I took the food back to the hotel (2 minute walk) and discovered that either I eat the spaghetti and meatball with my hands or go back and ask for cutlery. I opted to walk across the street and ask for cutlery.

When I returned to the restaurant to explain the situation , they didn't seem to understand and tried to laugh it off. When I explained how inconvenient this was and unamused I was, theyapologized and went to get the cutlery. They returned to me apologetically and advised me that they were out of disposable cutlery and offered to go next door (their partner restaurant?).

I said no, I will just ask the hotel bistro for cutlery due to another restaurant's lack of attention to detail 

I eventually dove in to cold mushy noodles and a cold meat ball. Not at all impressed. I also ordered the charity bread because I love the idea of giving back to the community. The bread was stale and inedible. Not to offend, but I wouldn't even offer this bread to someone on the street. One could easily choke on it. They also gave me way too much olive oil. Literally 1/2 a cup. Staying in a hotel folks,  not preparing for a Zombie apocalypse! 

I almost asked for a refund and offer to return the food but I was hungry after an intense and productive work weekend. I even tipped a decent amount on this takeout order. Unimpressed.

This visit was on February 29, 2016 8pm-ish."}
{"text":"It is really a hit or miss at this place. I rave and swear by their Lobster spaghetti. Recommended it to many people and they loved it as well. Their steak and burger that I have tried were meh. Will always come back for their lobster spaghetti!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a nice place great atmosphere and an easy detailed menu several house made items, mozzarella, pasta dressings. Somebody cares about quality and impeccable service. Everyone smiles very friendly and willing to please some of my favorite US restaurants don't even get these details right. This place is a solid 5 stars. Can't say enough about the great service and food. I had the Caesar salad, a stuffed meatball and the Pomodoro pizza Scaddabush would be a great place for any occasion. Tiffany and Paige rock.

Oh my goodness, try the Tiramisu, even if your full."}
{"text":"Scaddabush and I go way back as I frequented the Square One location when I lived in Mississauga. I am so happy to work nearby this surprisingly spacious location now. The ambience is just right and I've been here many times, and know I will return many more times. 
The *only* downside is that the outdoor seating kind of sucks.. you're literally seated in single file along gerard right on the street, so keep that in mind if you want to dine outdoors.
I could say a lot about the food and rave about the fresh mozzarella like everyone else does, but I'll leave it at a few short recommendations:
The mozzarella with the pingue prosciutto
The meatball in any form
The charity bread because A) it's cheap, B) ain't nothing wrong with garlic, oil, and carbs, and C) charity
The shrimp pasta with capers -- though I think it is hit and miss depending on who is in the kitchen it can sometimes be really good
The grilled cheese with fig and prosciutto
The bruschetta (the classic one, haven't tried the others)

There are more good things on the many than there are bad, so pick with confidence!"}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends. I'm so sad that they took the braised beef ravioli off the menu when they changed from Alice Fazooli's but the new place has a great atmosphere and lots of great additions to the menu.
The best thing is the honey basil drink... Possibly the best cocktail I have ever had. Would come back just for this."}
{"text":"What a joke at night. Never seen servers and staff less willing to serve customers. Seemed like everyone was having a better time chatting with their colleagues. Usually like coming here for a beer. But tonight felt like it was a totally different place. 

Asked 3 different waiters to place an order and all of them told me they'll find my waiter that seemed no where to be found. We walked out since this place was a joke tonight. 

Went next door to Jack Astors and was helped immediately.

After sitting at Jack Astors for less than 5 mins. 3 waiters have approached us with a very positive attitude and we have drinks :)

All this love here is over whelming"}
{"text":"Service here is not consistent.   I found the food tasty but way too oily.
My first experience was positive the second terrible.
I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Scaddabush.

Gord ordered the Baked Penne Carbonara (he loves Carbonara).  He said it was delicious and he'd get it again.

I ordered Chicken Parmesan (I love Chicken Parm).  Mine too was delicious and I'd get it again.

We shared a dessert ... well, Gord wanted a spoonful and I had the rest!  It was okay and I'd get it again.

Christina was our server.  She was friendly and chatty and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Their staff and food NEVER disappoint.
The decor is \"homey\" and cool. It does get noisy but totally tolerable. Seatings are spacious and comfortable, not to mention clean. Lighting is sufficient, always kept at a comfortable level.
I know plenty of people have mentioned it, but I can't not talk about their mozzarella. They are FRESHLY made IN HOUSE. They are made by their own chef, and you cannot go wrong with FRESH. Their pizzas are made to order from scratch, much like their pasta. Places that taste this good usually charge you both your arms and legs and then some.
It is definitely a place to go whether it is a party of two or a party of 10. Their servers will always make sure you have a good time with a very nice meal."}
{"text":"This place is a great find! 
Awesome atmosphere, delicious food. All their pasta is homemade, you can definitely taste it. I had the roasted veggie sandwich which was very good. Overall, very impressed!
Prices were fairly reasonable for the quality and portions, and service was excellent. If I lived nearby, I would definitely go often!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Some of the best Italian I've had in a very long time.  Loved the fresh mozzarella made in house!  Everything was so good!  One of my colleagues who was on the same trip ate there 3 times in 3 nights!  I must say, had I found it earlier, I would have as well.  Service and food both wonderful."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, just sad that the portions are half of what the were last summer. The food is amazing!

Service is great, though a bit long. A"}
{"text":"Went here tonight, and honestly loved the experience, considering what was here before, this is definitely an improvement.  Our server was AMAZING. But it was also her first shift ever, so she was eager to please, keen to help, quick with orders, quick with service, and loved talking to us.  We loved talking to her too!  

Food wise, I have to say as an Italian I was disappointed by the homemade mozzarella.  It just tasted like a giant boconccini.  It was hard through the middle, and believe me, try true buffalo mozzarella and its hard on the outside soft and creamy on the inside.  To die for.  So that was a little disappointing.

The pasta was ok, I've had better homemade pasta but hell... I'm at a restaurant beside a movie theatre and a mall.  I can't expect miracles. 

Great for a night out before a movie or if you just want a lax place but are sick and tired of jack Astors.

Tip: if you want better Italian food try grano's down the street or mondellos in Streetsville, or if your downtown, dimmi in Yorkville.  10 dollar pasta made by the mafia, you know it's authentic."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of food and service. It used to be great few years ago when it first started. Had underwhelming experience past 2 times. Pizza is almost always overcooked (burnt, and no, thats not well done) at the bottom while the top is undercooked. Server suggested its something to do with the way they switch the ovens... (who knows!)

Pasta was cold when delivered to the table. When they tried to correct that, it was lukewarm. Then it took them another 10 mins to bring cheese and pepper. All in all, not worth repeating or recommending."}
{"text":"We didn't get in for the Yelp event but wanted to try Scaddabush anyway, as the food looked very enticing based on the photos.

We made reservations, but if you come early (5:30pm), a table for 2-4 is definitely possible ! 

We ordered the ...
Calamari Fritti - very nice with the sauce. could be crispier, but that's just a personal preference. 

Brushetta - Fresh Mozzarella & sun dried tomatos - looked so delish in photos! It was nice but could be seasoned slightly longer. Loved the sweet vinaigrette sauce that was on it. 

Stuffed Meatball - really loved this! Wish it were bigger but it was nice and tasty! My fav dish for the evening! 

Pesto Pollo pasta - This was a bit bland. I am not Italian but if I can use a Food Network recipe and it's tastier than something at a restaurant, that's a problem. The pasta itself had a nice texture as they are made fresh everyday. But the sauce was a little disappointing. I couldn't taste the pesto much. Glad we only got the small size. 

Service was excellent and the waitress always made sure everything was ok. She was also very personable. 

The restaurant is also perfect for groups if you're planning on a birthday. They were hosting somebody's 60th bday when we were there. 

I would definitely come back again. Next time it's time for pizza!"}
{"text":"This location is much smaller than the Richmond Hill location but is very spacious. There are a variety of different styles of seating to accommodate everyone. The interior decor is casual yet beautifully decorated. 

The service on a weekday night was absolutely perfect. Could not have asked for a better server. Service was prompt and we were never left unattended for too long. 

The food was perfect. The pasta was cooked exactly like it should be and tasted very fresh. The ingredients were also very fresh and tasty. They were very accommodating to my dairy allergy. It's really difficult to eat out with any kind of allergy but I had such a great experience. Not only was the server very knowledgeable, but she even offered substitutes without having to run back and forth to ask the kitchen. An excellent experience in my opinion. 

Food came out on time. Bills came on time. There was no rush to leave and no long waits. If you come in on a Friday night or the weekend, I'd expect there to be longer waits but I'd say it's definitely worth it! Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere good location. I got the stuffed meatballs with spaghetti. Tasted very good and fresh. Service was good and they checked up on us often. 

I didn't like how we didn't get offered table bread. Especially at the prices of the dishes. 

All in all I would come back for the food but at the price point I have better restaurants to visit."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now. Both times the service was disappointing. The second time we ordered a few appetizers to share which is one of my favourite things to do but most of the food was cold. I would definitely order everything separately next time to get it all hot."}
{"text":"Revamping & rebranding Alice Fazooli's to Scaddabush was a great idea! I have been here a few times since it's opened & I am very impressed! However, there are dishes I would recommend staying away from - this review will come later. 

Dishes I WOULD recommend: 
Fresh mozzarella - This is made fresh daily (so they say) from 5pm to 11pm everyday. I don't care if it's made fresh on-site or not I just love it. They recently changed the size of the crostini & it was a good call. I would highly recommend this as a starter or something after work like apps & drinks. I have tried all three variations off the menu: Naked, Buratta & Pingue Prosciutto. 

For those who are new to this cheese board thing, try out the Naked mozzarella, it's simple & a good way to start out. The Buratta has truffle oil on it & can be rich but otherwise still a good choice. The Pingue Prosciutto has meat & come with fig jam - the fig jam is DELICIOUS! Fig jam can be weird for novice meat & cheese boarders but the fig jam is a MUST TRY. You will not regret it! 

Appetizers or \"Sociables\":  
Calamari Fritti - DELICIOUS! The portion size is a bit of a rip-off for $11.28. However, it is flavorful, cooked right & the salsa verde aïoli is perfect! But like I said, it could use a little more pieces of calamari. 

Crispy Polenta Fries - This was a surprise. I was a little cautious of this since I have not had polenta like this before but it is very good! The portion size is perfect for sharing & perfect for a meal if you're not sharing. It's a little heavy & you will start feeling a little full when your main comes out. The Sunday Sauce tastes so homemade! 

Chicken Parmesan Bites - I would recommend if you want a light appetizer. It's a small serving, so it's not necessarily something I'd suggest for sharing. 

Meatballs: 
I would DEFINITELY recommend whether your getting it \"Straight up\" or \"Stuffed.\" It's just one large meatball & good enough for one. I usually have it with spaghetti & I usually have enough left to take home. 

Fresh Pasta: 
Pesto Pollo - This is my favorite dish on the menu. I have tried all three sizes: small, large & social. Small is more of a lunch size serving. The large is a dinner size & big enough to doggy-bag for later. Leftovers are always as delicious as the first day it was served! The social I have ordered & split with the boyfriend & HOLLAAAAYY! It is no joke - it is a large serving! App + Social size = Economical. 

Veal Parmesan - Portion size is more than enough. The veal is cheesy & tender. It is always cooked right because there is still a crunch from the panko. 

Desserts: 
The tiramisu & cheesecake; both have mascarpone & are creamy delicious goodness! The tiramisu is served in a jar & I'm not sure if it's a good size for sharing since I've only ordered it for myself & BODIED the entire thing. I can tell you the cheesecake is good for sharing! It's similar to the one (it may even be the same) found in Hunter's Landing.

Now, what I would NOT recommend...

Charity bread - Sure, the concept of the net proceeds going to local charities is a noble thing to do & would make anyone want to order it. But (don't hate me please) it's not the most exciting bread. Ok, I get it, it's bread for a good cause, but c'mon it has to be kind of delicious - no? It's pretty bland & can use cheese on top.

Fresh Pasta: Capri - I have had this 3 times & it's quality is inconsistent. Ok, I get seafood at any place can be finicky but this is just BAD. The first time I've had it, the mussels were spoiled. When brought to the attention of a manager it was explained to me that the mussels are actually bought from a vendor that pre-cooks them & then they are just reheated with the dish. I'm not sure how quality control can be done. I mean, they could go bad in transport - no? The second time I decided to make a risky decision & order it again. This time the mussels were good. They didn't smell like the went bad nor did they taste bad. Most importantly, I wasn't running to the bathroom. The third time is the last time I am ever ordering this dish. ALL the mussels smelled rancid & their rancid juices leaked into the pasta & it was AWFUL. I think it's not the wisest business decision to buy pre-cooked seafood. It runs a lot of risk, if you ask me. I would NOT recommend this dish at all! 

As for the service, it's pretty good in the dining room; the servers are very pleasant & always helpful. The lounge is another story; the service doesn't really exist. One visit we decided to sit in the lounge. It took about 15 minutes before someone came. Which was annoying, since the girl had walked by the table & made eye contact with me a few times before actually coming. 

The atmosphere is good & their weekend guest DJ's play really good music. 

Overall a good place & I'd continue to eat at - 4/5!!!"}
{"text":"This was my third time visiting this restaurant. As before the food was delicious, particularly the apps. 

Tip: try the spinach dip!!

This is a great place for a large group and it is vegitarian friendly with a nice ambience.  

My only complaint is the slow service. This place due to its popularity is often very busy and as such food orders (especially when you have larger groups) can take a very long time. Also each time I have visited I had a hard time stopping the wait staff. 

Bottom line: if you have time this is a great place."}
{"text":"I had a friends birthday recently and we went here for dinner. We were like 25 people. Music was loud for the type of music they were playing (DJ). I ordered the charity bread (based on reviews I saw here) and yes it is amazing as well as the calamari. I ordered the veal Parmesan which I wasn't a fan served with a side order of pasta (not good). Service was average considering we were a big group but based on that the restaurant wasn't packed we could of had a better service. ORDER THE BREAD!! I find the food is overpriced as well."}
{"text":"Friend recommended the place and did not disappoint.  Ordered calamari for starters and ordered with fettuccine as main course definitely coming back to this place and recommending to friends."}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance: excellent. 
Service: top-notch. 
Food: no. 
This is the second Scaddabush experience (the first at College Park left me feeling horribly ill) and I'm giving up on them. 
My cousin and I decided to check out the Scarborough Town Centre location after a day of outlet shopping. 
We were greeted warmly by the host and Julian was a very cheerful, bright server who tended to our every need. 
Only problem ...the food isn't all that great. The three cheese penne was slop in a bowl...with the weird addition of green peas. 
The sausage fettuccine sounded good on paper but it was less than flavorful. 
Only thing I enjoyed: the garlic Parmesan fries and the blood orange soda. 
Overpriced and bland food. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"Been to Scaddabush multiple times but first time on this location. 
Food ordered were sausage fennel fettuccini, rosemary fries and chicken parm. 
The pasta was the best thing we ordered. Nice creamy rose, flavourful, good body on sauce. Must order ! $14.5 for small
The chicken parm was disappointing. The Alfredo sauce didn't taste like there was any cheese to it. Just a cream sauce which tasted nothing like Italian cooking. The chicken was decent. $20
The garlic rosemary fries came cold, and we wanted to say something but service was hard to flag down. So we just started eating. $5

All in all it's what you get at a corporate chain. Big portions. Decent food. Decent service"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place more than one star is because of their mozzarella. Everything else including their service sucks. Food is tasteless and it's not even close to italian food. Food was 45 minutes late and the appetizers came with our main dish. The server did not even fill our glasses with water and avoided eye contact the whole time. My dad even had to go to the bar to ask for water. 
They keep their kitchen open because they don't know they need chefs and servers to keep the place running. Go to Reds instead!"}
{"text":"We entertained a couple guests from Japan here and they loved it. The food is terrific, from the salads and bruschetta to the pasta and meatballs. But what brings us back is the service. On the three occasions we visited (for business) the servers were so nice, we wanted to invite them out with us afterwards -- not kidding. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For chain Italian, Scaddabush wasn't bad at all. I was a bit hesitant because the reviews here are very mixed, but my personal experience was very good. 

Conveniently located near the Square One Mall, Scaddabush has a nice interior - rustic with very high ceilings, meaning it's going to be very NOISY when it's busy. There's also an open kitchen so it was a little smoky on the inside. Fortunately, it was a nice enough night that we could enjoy the patio - you'll hear some traffic from the busy roads nearby but they've done a good job of creating a flowery little oasis in the middle of a retail zone.

Food wise - they really push their house made mozzarella - like pretty aggressively. We opted out because it seemed like a lot of food for just 2 people at $12+, is kind of expensive to boot. I went with a basic margarita pizza (around $14) which is plenty for one person. Someone else commented that they give you \"pizza scissors\" which do work but are awkward. My pizza wasn't oily at all - the crust was nice and crisp and the overall dish was light (for a pizza). My dining partner had potato crusted snapper which he said was really good.

There's a full bar, but I opted for a glass of wine (pricey-ish). They've got a good selection by the glass and plenty of cocktails if that's your preference. Overall, I'd say the food was \"above average\" for a chain.

What really impressed me was the service. Someone is doing some really good training here as every person I interacted with from the host to other servers, was incredibly friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"great food & great service.
Came here after a long day (after going to playdium). I'm not in the sauga area often so we just picked a restaurant opened close by. This place seriously rocks. Working at a crappy Italian banquet hall has scarred Italian food for me, however everything here was really good the charity bread, the BLT & the penne left us super super full. Our waiter was super knowledgeable and attentive. It was simply great !"}
{"text":"The 3 of us went to Scaddabush on Friday evening at 5pm. We were seated right away and given the choice of inside or outside. We decided to head out to the patio. The reason we chose 5pm was to try their fresh mozzarella that they make in house but only between the hours of 5 and 10pm. 

Our server was awesome, patient when we couldn't decide which wine to get and attentive throughout our visit. I was toying between 2 California Cabs and he brought me both to sample so I could choose one. Nice touch!

There were 3 choices of mozzarella (naked, Buratta and prosciutto) so we decided on the Buratta infused with honey and truffle cream that came with some crusty bread drizzled with olive oil. I had just come back from Italy so was spoiled with amazing cheese there. In my view it was good but not spectacular. The girls thought it was great so please do try it.  It was good, I was just not blown away. 

It started getting a little chilly around 7pm so they put a heater near our table which was lovely! We left around 8 after our wine and cheese. I loved that we were not rushed despite only getting a glass of wine each and an app to share.

Will be back to try their fresh pasta indeed!"}
{"text":"I've been to Scaddabush quite a few times and while the atmosphere is nice, the food is just okay. Here is a list of everything I've had here and its rating out of 5. 

*Appetizers*
Calamari - 3/5. No spicy mayo or chipotle??
Chicken Parmesan Bites - 2/5. Would not try again.

*Mains*
Margarita pizza - 3.5/5. Basic, good. 
Sophia pizza - 4/5. Second favorite main here. 
Brick chicken - 3/5. Extremely salty. Not worth the price.
Lobster Spaghetti - 4/5. Best main though it's very oily.

*Dessert*
Tiramisu - 4.5/5. Yes, this is good. Comes in a mason jar. Super creamy, strong coffee flavor, no lady fingers.

**Final verdict**
Go here if you feel like having okay/good Italian food and you don't want to shell out too much dough. That was a joke cause I said dough and this is an Italian place. 3/5 overall."}
{"text":"The pasta was over cooked and we ended up leaving in the middle of our dinner as we didn't want to wait for another dish. Compared to the Mississauga location .... this place has a-lot of catching up to do."}
{"text":"Unpretentious good food here.  Fresh mozzarella three different ways to start.  Tried two, both were very fresh and creamy.  The spaghetti with meatball was very good.  The sauce was flavorful but light.  It complemented the meatball, which was tasty, nicely.  The food was very filing so unfortunately we had no room for desert."}
{"text":"I love the giant scissor on the pizza, love their charity bread, love the liquor selections, love the location and most important their freshly made mozzarella!!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I stumbled across this restaurant after and evening of sightseeing and shopping. It had good reviews and we decided to check it out. We were a table of 4 and had a 20 minute wait on a Friday evening so we decided to grab a couple drinks at the bar and before we knew it we were seated at a high top table on the side. Keep in mind this restaurant has mostly high top tables, just something to consider. I had the lemon slush cocktail which was sweet and a good portion but seemed to completely lack alcohol. I asked for a second round but a double and they brought me the drink with a shot on the side. However it seemed like they brought me a shot of the liqueur, so I'm not sure how much, if any, vodka is actually in this drink. I had the classic meatball as an appetizer which was nothing to rave about. It was a bit lackluster in flavor. I had the pesto pollo fettuccine as my entree which was bland in my opinion. My friends ordered similar pastas and we all had to request pepper and freshly grated Parmesan to try to amp up the flavor. I even resorted to asking for more of the pesto cream sauce to try to supplement the dry taste.  No one had anything special to say about their meals. It seemed like food you can get from any chain restaurant. The ambiance and decor were nice. They had candles at each table and played some catchy music. The lighting is quite dark and it can get loud later in the evening. I will say that The service was great and she even recommended some bars and lounges to attend afterwards."}
{"text":"How many times have I run past this place and wondered what it was like? Too many to count! Finally headed there for a nice dinner with some of my girls to see what I had been missing. For starters - if you don't have any food restrictions or allergies, you will be very very pleased! 
In the gluten free world, well, you know the way it is. All of the pasta dishes said they could be made with gfree noodles, but few of the dishes could be made without gluten (breadcrumbs in the meat sauce, squash ravioli, unsure of wheat in the white sauce, etc). I decided instead to go with the chicken avocado BLT. It was so delicious and the gluten free bun was great! Nice and springy and didn't fall apart! Lots of avocado in the sandwich too. I was nice and full afterwards. I also had a peach mango Bellini which was fantastic and chocolate gelato which really just tasted like chocolate fudge ice cream, but we're not in Italy so I don't expect much. I did end up getting sick later, which I'm guessing was the gelato. He did warn me that it wasn't made in-house and I made the bad decision of thinking ice cream is always okay. No reason to deduct stars for my own bad decisions though, lol. A bad decision I'm still paying for today. 
Overall, a good experience. And if you sign up for the mailing list you can get $10 a purchase of $30 + (before tax and excluding alcohol)."}
{"text":"This won't be a food comment as much as it will be a comment regarding the venue - I just went recently for a birthday party and it's: 1. Too loud, people have to almost yell at each to hear one another; 2. Quite dark. I understand theyre going for a certain look but I can hardly see the menu!; 3. They REALLY need to keep an eye on their floors! I slipped once and smashed my right knee on the floor - it was bruised for a few days. When I went last weekend for the birthday party I almost slipped sideways because there was water on the floor and it became like ice! If I ever slip and fall again I'm actually going to consider legal advice!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested that we go to Scaddabush as she was a fan. Upon arriving at the restaurant, the hostess asked us how many people were in our party then brushed us off and did not give us any directions, did not ask for our names or phone number. We stood around for 15 minutes and then went back to the desk to ask what was going on. A friendly host apologized and took us right away. Not a great first impression. We were seated next to the mozzarella bar where they make fresh mozzarella -that was neat. We waited ten minutes for any waiter to appear, many walked by but none stopped to greet us. I had enough at this point. A waitress finally arrived and apologized profusely and said there was a missing wine bottle problem. She was very friendly, polite and knowledgeable and legitimately felt bad that we had to wait. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with rosemary fries. The sandwich was a little spicier for my tastes and the bun was a bit cold. I kept seeing dishes pass me by that looked amazing. This place has great food from what I could see, it was just a case of my ordering the wrong item. If it wasn't for the sweet waitress I didn't catch her name (very tiny and had a band around her elbow,) I would have rated this place much lower. This place was packed on a Thursday night. The music was a tad loud and I hurt my voice attempting to speak to my friend. Please retrain your hostess staff and lower the volume, also give that waitress a raise, she's the best. I will return and try another dish next time."}
{"text":"Great Place!  Delicious Pasta :) Very Happy with the service...

Will definitely update after I come back from tonights dinner :)!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about scaddabush so I decided to come here to celebrate New Years. My friend recommended me the Lobster Spaghetti as she said it was pretty bomb. I was really looking forward to try it! 

Our waitress was very sweet. She came to check up on us and made sure our water is filled! 

The spaghetti is more on the dry side. I was hoping it can be creamier but it was just average and dry. There was a spoon of crumbs on the side which added a bit of flavour to the spaghetti. However, there was only a small few pieces of lobster. 

Although it was a bit of disappointment, I will be coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I went to Scaddabush for dinner with a friend the other night and can't quite decide whether I enjoyed it or not. It's a huge restaurant, beautifully decorated. I found the server to be quite slow and took an awkwardly long time to describe the specials. She was slow in delivering our drinks and failed to take our order when she finally gave them to us so we had to wait 10 minutes for her to return again. It wasn't very busy so I'm not sure why the service was so slow. 
The food was pretty delicious though. I had the Parmesan chicken sandwich. The chicken was crispy and cooked perfectly on a really nice crusty bun. The peppers on it were under-cooked for my personal taste so I had to take them off. The caeser salad was amazing. My friend had the charity bread and pesto salad and loved them both. 
I'm not in any rush to return, but I might if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love their chicken and shrimp pasta! Service here is always great. And have awesome DJ's on the weekends!"}
{"text":"The food and ambiance were good. The service was lacklustre, absent and inconsistent."}
{"text":"First time here and had high hopes as the previous Canyon Creek sucked. The server was very friendly with prompt service and answered all our questions. The food was only mediocre. I had the pasta with stuffed meatball which is suppose to be a favourite of people. I found out stuffed is 1 pepperoni and a dab of cheese. I expected a better meal and am not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"My favourite spot! Food delicious, staff friendly. Definitely worth the try! Fresh made cheese, how awesome is that! Go and check it out on a weekend, DJ is so cool."}
{"text":"I am a regular here since I live so close.  The atmosphere is perfect for a glass of wine with friends or a date night.  The burrata is hit or miss, and the avocado bruschetta is always delish.  

What j find annoying is they never want to take reservations, but when you walk in and it's full, they say \"you should have made reservations\".  It's still a good time though, and small groups get in fairly easily."}
{"text":"Made lunch reservations for Friday at noon. I brought several colleagues with me. We had to be back at work for just after one pm. and we only received our app at 12:45pm. We sat there for 45 minutes with nothing - not even our water was re-filled. And our waitress was very confused which threw us off. For example, 2 of us wanted to order from the Winterlicious menu, and one from the regular menu. I had confirmed in advance that this would be ok, so when she told us that everyone at the table had to either order from the reg menu or the Winterlicious menu, it upset our table. It turns out that this is the case only for large groups. The restaurant was busy, the service was disorganized, and the food was just okay. I am pretty sure this will be my last visit as I am too apprehensive to introduce this restaurant to my colleagues when the experience leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant to meet some friends for patio drinks and food. Wonderful vibe on the patio, it's very open and comfortable. It's a long distance from the kitchen to the patio, so the service is slow when you need certain things. Great place for a drink, probably wouldn't return to dine in."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dessert. To my surprise, they actually had a high chair. Scaddabush is going for the same clientele as nearby Joey's or a Moxie's or Milestones. The atmosphere is dark with a lot of timber. Staff was very attentive and friendly. They helped us out with the little extras we needed for the kid. We ordered a Monte Cristo, Tiramisu and the cheesecake. The Monte Cristo was excellent. The tiramisu was pretty good but the cheesecake was a disappointment. Overall- I can't comment on the food but I'd come here for drinks or dessert. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here for an anniversary dinner last night and I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the peach mango Bellini and they did not have it. So I had to settle for the blood orange. Then I attempted to order the Bomba Buratta. Apparently they ran out of the spicy ragu.  On to my attempt to order the Capri pasta. Couldn't do it either.  They ran out of mussels. I had to settle for a Pesto Pollo.  So out of three menu items that I attempted to order, none were available and I had to settle for something that I did not want.  A previous poster mentioned to avoid coming on a Sunday. It seems Tuesday is a problem as well."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice and walked out because of the poor service. 

Third time I was determined to stick it out even though the service was still ridiculous and slow with and almost empty restaurant. Staff all over in groups chatting to each other. 

Food was WAY overpriced. I've had enough. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Honestly the best bread for sandwiches and their mozza is amazing. I got the chicken avocado blt for $16 and it was so damn good. Everything was tender and perfect. 

My friends all got other dishes and they were very satsified. I believe the grilled cheese was one of the best. Def have to try it!

Great service and a nice patio to hang out in!"}
{"text":"I had been to Scaddabush a few times before, but only for drinks and nibbles, and I never really ate anything.

I have now had dinner here and wanted to write a review based on the experience.


The staff are friendly, and when the hostess sat us at a tiny booth for 2, we asked to be moved as I walk with a cane, and it was a birthday dinner so there was a gift bag of presents, purses, etc, so the booth had no room for extras.  We were moved to a 4 top which suited our needs perfectly.

The room is big and loud, the high ceilings and cement walls don't help in this regard.  If you are looking for an intimate dining experience, this is not the place. In fact, I really don't see the point of the music, its entirely drowned out by the chatter.

The meatball was delicious, the best part of the meal, tender, juicy and the sauce on top had that slow cooked taste and was perfect.  The bread underneath seemed pointless as it dissolved into the sauce.  The garlic chips were nice but not the star.

The charity bread is loaded with garlic and butter/oil at the bottom.  If you love the taste of barely cooked garlic dripping in butter, than this is for you.  I found it a bit strong, but I tend to prefer garlic cooked more so that its a bit milder and sweeter.  Proceeds go to charity, hence the name, so that is great.

My friend had the chicken parmesan and she loved it, it was crispy and the layer of cheese on top was perfectly melted and the chicken moist.  The spaghetti with tomato sauce that sat beside it was disappointing... the sauce was bland, and no amount of freshly grated parmesan could help it.  Also the noodles were mushy.  I have had fresh pasta at many restaurants and that was not the reason for such soft pasta, which is what the waiter claimed.

I had the Pesto Pollo, which if I wasn't expecting Pesto, would have been okay, because the sundried tomatoes in the dish were the best I have ever tasted, sweet and not bitter, tender and easy to eat.  However the creamy sauce did not taste like pesto at all and was very bland.  The only thing that faintly tasted like pesto was the shreds of basil on top.  I actually added some of the garlic from the charity bread pan and this helped a bit, but overall the dish was bland and the pasta, again, was too soft.  Considering the amount of parmesan the waiter grated on top (which is a nice touch), I did not expect this dish to be so bland.

Since it was my birthday dinner, my friend asked the waiter in advance to have a candle put in my dessert, and since I couldn't decide on which dessert we shared 3 desserts which they brought out on a big wooden tray with those fireworks candles, very impressive!

The zeppole was so dry, and stale we should have sent them back,  We each had a bite, dipped in the Nutella sauce and it literally tasted like day old doughnuts that were reheated to just above room temperature.  Sad face.

The apple ravioli was my friend's favourite, basically an apple turnover with ice cream on the side, but I found the apples inside to be like canned pie filling and the ratio of crust to fruit was way too high, and I thought the dough would be flakier but it was very dense.

The tiramisu was my favourite of the 3, but the marscapone cream just seemed like pure marscapone, which made for a very heavy dessert.  The marsala and espresso soaked lady fingers were perfect, and the chocolate shavings in addition  to the cocoa dusting was a nice addition.

Lastly, for those with accessibility issues, note that there are two floors AND there are many high tables with stools instead of chairs, so if you have any issues with stairs, reserve a table on the main floor and ask for a low table.

While the washrooms are on the 2nd floor, there is an accessible washroom at the back on the ground floor, but I noticed that because it is so close to the tables, everyone seems to use it.  Both times I waited for the accessible washroom and patrons from tables beside it were using it who clearly did not have any mobility issues.  In fact I heard staff tell people that the washrooms were upstairs but there was one at the back. That is not cool.

Scaddabush is convenient and a welcome addition to the neighbourhood but I'm not sure if I would return for more than drinks and shareables.  Or maybe just order some meatballs to go."}
{"text":"Bruschetta... AMAZING! Awesome atmosphere, food is delicious, and servers are super friendly. A little pricey, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!

I am addicted to their fresh mozarella which is made after 5 pm everyday. And their house made pastas are so good. Service is great as well. If I want to unwind after a long day with some good food and wine, I come here."}
{"text":"My mom was craving this place since we first went there in November, and we were so excited to come back. The place is pretty busy. The mozzarella is a MUST if you go here!!! We got the kind with prosciutto, which I think is the best. We also got a stuffed meatball and the charity bread. Meatball was great, and we liked the idea behind the charity bread, but the bread was too oily. 
I got shrimp spaghetti for my entree, which was great--the shrimps were small and bite-sized. Service was friendly (maybe that's just the norm in Canada) and timely. Excited to come back here this fall!"}
{"text":"Tried the atomico & butcher pizza & it's so-so flavor. The ravioli is quite good and the Chicken Parm is not bad either. On the aps ask the Osso Bucco Bites with fries instead. much better dish this way. Overall the place has a good vibe to it and the menu has enough solid hits."}
{"text":"So apparently, they have zucca ($15-$32) now! Craving satisfied! We tried DIAVOLO pizza ($16++) too. And it was good. Cant get a hold of servers for most of the times. But food is good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing servers. The food was amazing but the prices are a bit expensive what is Italian food so it's really great. Pre hospitality very clean and very nice staff."}
{"text":"Prb my 10th time or so visiting scadda - food rarely  disappoints. My faves are the shrimp spaghetti and the chicken parm with bolognese instead of marinara. Today's experience at the stc location was even nicer than usual - thanks for putting up the volume of the game for those in the bar section wanting to catch game 1 of raps vs cavs - truly showed how much the customer's experience was a priority. Shout out to our server Michael who was beyond friendly not to mention attentive and prompt - cherry on top you were!"}
{"text":"Can I have that Naked fresh mozzarella again?
I'd return to Scaddabush for that mozzarella alone. I liked everything in that dish: focaccia crostini, fresh mozzarella bun that you can cut into slices, and tomato jam that tasted sweet. It'd make a perfect snack at any time of the day. I'm definitely trying some other fresh mozzarella next time I'm here.

I also tried a Caprese salad, and that was fresh and delicious. For my main dish, I got a small Capri pasta. Shrimps, scallops, mussels and other seafood in it were soft and they melted in my mouth. I found their mussels different from most other places, because the mussel meats were so soft. While I liked the seafood being soft, I didn't enjoy the pasta being soft. It was cooked too \"well-done\" for me. I didn't like the tomato sauce that much, either.

The waitress was attentive and professional. She did a great job of timely asking us if we needed anything and also leaving us alone to enjoy our meal. This place would be a great spot for date nights.

Get their Social Club discount of $10 off if you spend more than $30. Sign up for it at least 24 hours before your reservation so you can get the discount!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush is a fun, lively restaurant to go to with friends to socialize, eat and drink in a fun atmosphere. 
Though I've had to wait for tables multiple times, the end result is worth it. 

The fresh buffala mozzarella with truffle oil is the star of the show, hands down. I think about it all the time! So soft and gooey, and I'm a sucker for truffle oil. 
The bruschetta is nice to share, as well as the spinach dip and focaccia! The polenta bites were very decadent and a little heavy, but scrumptious. I think you could order it as a main instead! 

I've ordered spaghetti and the meatball, and enjoyed it; next time I will try my meatball stuffed! 
My boyfriend has gotten the chicken parm twice now and loved it both times. 
I've also been with family and friends who have sworn for the butternut squash ravioli and chicken parm bites. 
Next time I will try a pizza to share!"}
{"text":"Been to this location multiple times both with family and with colleagues and have always enjoyed it. Food is always good and fresh. I always get the caprese salad with grilled chicken. I also love their seafood pasta. I would definitely get their pasta rather than pizza. The aesthetic is rustic and the location is quite big."}
{"text":"The service, food and drinks are great here! It's the perfect place for a girl's night. My go-to drink is the blood orange Bellini = so delicious! The charity bread and homemade pastas are wonderful as well! 

The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because the prices are pretty steep, and while most of their pasta portions are reasonable, the butternut squash ravioli is extremely small for the price. 

Overall, a nice atmosphere for great Italian food with your girlfriends and a huge selection of cocktails!"}
{"text":"It was first time here, and the food was decent but the service was great! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was visiting from San Diego and went there with family. I normally don't go to chain restaurants, but this place really did not have a chain restaurant type of feel. It has a really great feel - it's young, fun, but also family friendly. They manage to pull off being a great spot to take a date, go hang out with friends, or take family with young kids. You immediately get the feel that they are going for when you walk in, (because there is a DJ at the front desk!) but you see lots of different ages and demographics. My 16 month old felt perfectly comfortable grooving to the music . 

The ambience is great - there are big wooden tables, big paintings, jars of preserves everywhere. There is a framed quote \"eat drink and be social\". They also nailed the lighting. 

The food was awesome. Literally everything is made in-house or somewhere local. If you want to be a locavore, this is a great option. The \"charity bread\" comes out with a big honking ball of house-made mozz, which has a really lovely texture. The bread is um - we'll-buttered lol. I'm vegetarian so I got the Cavatappi Sorrentina. I wanted something spicy, so they added some chopped pickled red pepper, and I must say it was quite delicious. My sister in law had the butternut squash ravioli which was very rich. Actually I would say all the food is very rich. If there is one feedback, that's probably the one thing i would say is that the food can be at times too rich, but it does not compromise on flavor. The server, Sonal, was very knowledgeable. She advised me on the wine, and suggested a beer for my husband and we liked our selections. My husband got the pesto pollo fettuccini which he enjoyed. My mother in law got the primavera Pizza. I had the leftovers the next day and it was on point, haha. We all enjoyed our meal. The prices are really reasonable. Especially given the good sized portions. I would suggest ordering the small size, unless of course u want to take a doggy bag home with u for the next day. 

I really appreciated that they were able to make a custom pasta dish for my daughter with just cavatappi and vegetables without too much salt and grease. 

Overall, great experience. The best parts of the restaurant is the vibe and service."}
{"text":"Food was better than expected - visited location at a slow time, 11/10 for service (THANKS TRISTAN). 

Had spaghetti and meatballs - meat ball was a little bit salty but pasta was good and extra points for the crisped garlic. 

Service was amazing, our server/bartender Tristan was blessed. Great with recommendations and offered drinks and desserts on the house - amazing! Will for sure visit again"}
{"text":"Great food and serving portions. Came here on a busy Saturday night and got seated quickly even with a big group of 7! Pizza (bacon and egg) oven baked to a perfect crisp. Good mix of ingredients, done just right. I would recommend cutting up the slices and dipping it in the cracked eggs. Additionally offered the carbonara which is one of my favourite dishes. A little creamy, and a bit dry, but pretty good. Egg right in the middle and is served on a hot pan. Would recommend both dishes. The pizza is good for 2 people!"}
{"text":"so when we first entered and asked for a table for 4 ppl.. we were told by the hostess that it would be a 30 min wait unless we had 5 ppl cuz then she could seat us right away. um..? weird..we lied and said a 5th person was coming and got a booth..tht was sized for 4 ppl. no idea what was going through her head there lol 

this place is really nice on the inside and their patio has the perfect amount of summer charm! i had:

white wine sangria-pretty good couldnt really taste wine though more limoncello

diavlo pizza-again was ok..the chicken had a good spice to it and the balsamic drizzle was nice but somehow was lacking something! i think it needed a bit more tomato sauce and cheese

bolognese pasta- once again...was ok! could have benefited from chili flakes or something but the meat flavour in the sauce was good

i got tiramsu for dessert which was so decadent! 

all in all i would come back for a drink on the patio but not for food when im actually starving"}
{"text":"Scaddabush was busy walking in but no line up for the tables.  
I got seated right away at 6:30ish on a Sunday night.  
My waitress, Olivia was super friendly and always came around to check up on us without hovering.

We ordered the
1. Pesto Pollo Fettuccine: 
- I expected this dish to be a little bland as there aren't any flavors in here that would give a kick of spice.  However, it was literally sooo bland that I thought I was just eating plain cream sauce.  I could not taste the pesto and the sundried tomatoes did not add flavor.  We asked to cracked pepper and it was like eating cream with pepper.  The large was filling, and they did give a lot of chicken, the fettuccine was al-dente and cooked perfectly.  They just have to work on the sauce!
2.  Margherita Pizza: It was bigger than I expected and it came with these huge scissors.  I actually enjoyed the experience with cutting my own pizza.  The pizza was thin and cooked perfectly.  I only ordered this for my guest as she was vegetarian so I probably wouldn't get this just for myself.  But definitely a veggie + and tasted great.

The total came up to approximately $41 (not including tip).  
I didn't get to grab dessert as it was getting late.

I'll be back to try something else off their menu.

PS. They do need to hire more floor staff as my waiter was running around trying to do a good job.  A server from the back came up to me twice before I ordered trying to give me plates of food.  When my food came out I saw her walking around to several other tables before realizing it was mine."}
{"text":"Buuuurrrrroooo this place took a minute na I'm saying jus fo dat fresh cheese pizza na am saying. Shit is whack got a mo fuka hungry fo dat sauce bowy faaaawwwwk you mean."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Nice place to have dinner with friends or family. The food was good. Nothing amazing but both me and my friend enjoyed our dishes. Our server was friendly and they were quite busy despite it being a weekday evening. I would recommend this place when you want to play it safe."}
{"text":"Was here on Friday for a girls' night out.  The service was really good.  The Pizza was so-so, but the calamari and the apple pie ravioli were really delicious.  The outdoor patio is very pretty."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from the minute that I walked in. My best friend has already been to these franchise and I always wanted to try this place. There was a couple of things that I wanted to try and thanks YELPERS for helping me decide! I really wanted to try the charity bread but craved calamari so I got that instead for apps - and it was amazing!

The calamari was delicious but was even better with that AMAZING basil garlic aoili sauce. I just wanted to dip everything in that sauce. The other red sauce was okay. Spicy but in comparison with the green sauce, definitely the green sauce! 

My friend got the caprese salad, looks delicious! I will need to try it next time. 

I ordered the Pesto Pollo Fettucini which was absolutely amazing. Only one thing that I did not like was the texture of the chicken. Like there was some pieces that felt like store bought prepacked cooked chicken but the pasta and the sauce was already amazing that I could have done without the chicken. The pasta was cooked perfectly, just enough sauce and flavor, I was one happy girl. 

For desserts, my bestfriend ordered the cheese cake and I ordered the salted chocolate cake. I think it was a mistake because I was soooo stuffed and tried forcing myself to finish the cake. It was alright, nothing wrong with a chocolate cake! 

I will definitely be coming back here for to try other things like their pizza. They definitely hook you with by walking around with samples! So yummmy! I love the vibe here and the service was amazing. Besides my chicken-not-so-much-of-a-disaster, the food and service was utterly amazing."}
{"text":"Good service and decent food but overly dark atmosphere and portion sizes are extremely small for what you pay."}
{"text":"For a mall restaurant, my experience at Scaddabush wasn't bad.  The environment definitely makes it an interesting place for a meal.  Food and service wise is definitely less on experience and more like you're part of the processing and a transaction.  You can't expect that much from a corporate brand.

The clear positive point is the environment... it's not your typical bland restaurant.  Visually it's intriguing with an industrial feel but then you have sparks of glamour like the large crystal chandelier.  Definitely a mash up of different styles but it works in the end.  Seating here is quite spacious and large.  There's a huge bar area for those who want to catch a drink and the game but if you want to dine, the dining space has every type of seating for you. 

The service is ... weird.  I have never been in a restaurant where it's clearly less than 50% full and been told at the hostess stand that I need wait to be seated.  What?  Are they under staff with 3 hostess standing around in the front that they can't seat me immediately?  Ok... that's different.  10 minutes later, we get called to be seated but that was honestly one of the most odd start to a dinner.  

The staffing in the room is interesting... though I think there is a main server in each area, there is a constant change of people coming to the tables and helping out with the water or ordering.  I dont know who exactly was the primary person.  It's funny I say that there was a lot of people because at the same time, there were serious gaps of time where we saw no one, done eating, and looking for the check.  That aside, it seems like a happy crew as I sat near the kitchen and every new staff went in there with cheers and hello to everyone.  

Food here is Italian leaning with some modern twists to make it lighter or more up to date.  The menu is pretty vast so I think you can find something for everyone.  It has your typical red sauce spaghetti and margherita pizza but it has a lot of apps and small plates should you want more variety.  Their fresh bread and mozzarella is supposedly a best seller.  For me, it was just something light and stuck to the meal sized salads.

Beet and goat cheese salad - I know... a salad in a corporate restaurant can't be good.  This one wasn't so bad.  Fair sizes though not as large as other meal salads.  This one was decently dressed with spinach leaves, beets, goat cheese, walnuts, and pears.  Supposedly it has pickled onions but they were few and far between.  I would say that visually it looked interesting with the reds and greens but flavour wise, it was just ok.  I liked how the dressing wasn't heavy but at the same time, it was missing any acidic bite.  Kinda bland to be honest.  Pears and walnuts added sweetness that probably made the salad veering too far away from the savoury.  It's not bad... for $15, its on the higher price point for ok.  3.5/5

They do offer a kid menu and it's quite a reasonable price for juice, a dish, a side, and a dessert for $10.  Mind you the main should be just pennies as they're plain pizza, plain red sauce pasta, grilled cheese, and there might be a chicken finger option.  Either way, it's boring and typical of a kids menu unfortunately.  The grilled cheese has super large pieces of bread.  I doubt a young kid could eat the entire thing.

Overall, it's not a bad option for a mall restaurant... maybe if I did more of the bar food, I would find better flavours and more interesting dishes.  I wont think it's a terrible spot but hoping there's better options in the area."}
{"text":"As far as casual fine-dining chains go, it's not bad. Most recently came on a Saturday night with a reservation for 12 and we got a long communal table. This place had more of a ski chalet/industrial farmhouse feel which was relatively more welcoming than the ambience at other \"premium-casual\" chains. Different types of customers too which was nice to see.

The food itself was alright but the quality and size felt a bit lacking for the price. We shared The Naked ($13) mozzarella among three people which pretty much only afforded one bite each as it was in a small flattened disc. While it was springy, the flavour didn't live up to their \"made in house\" hype and we were expecting it to be double the size. I also had the Zucca Ravioli ($16) which was decent but didn't leave me feeling full.

The staff were attentive and efficient though, especially considering our big party size. When we asked for separate bills and all paid by card, they even split the appetizers among the different sharing clusters without prompt which was really beyond expectations!"}
{"text":"I went to this place twice in the last month and had the same experience.  It is impossible to get drinks at the bar or your table, and it also takes forever to get your bill. 

All in all, the food is great. The ambiance is kind of cool and as much as I want to say all the servers are terrible, I seriously don't believe that.  The bar just feels understaffed.  One or two bartenders are responsible for servicing everyone at the very large bar area as well as the whole dining room.

I'm pretty easy going and it let me down twice (on a birthday and a date).  Sadly there are other places in the city I'd like to try before going back."}
{"text":"I've only been to SCADDABUSH once and I had a pizza with beer. The pizza was good and the atmosphere was nice too. I'd have to come back next time and try something else other than pizza to understand how good the chef is at that place. The service was superb. They asked for my first name and had a bit of small chat, which was a nice touch. My first impression was positive, even though there was nothing outstanding about the pizza itself. It was alright, but not as good as Pizzeria Libretto or Falasca. One thing for sure, this place feel more commercial than mom-and-pop type restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was great. Today we had pesto pasta, spicy sausage pasta, Balsamic mozzarella bruschetta and prosciutto mozzarella. The pastas were very flavorful, and the cheeses were  nice but keep in mind for the extra price difference they only provide 2 slices of prosciutto. The bruschetta was unfortunately very wet making the bred in the centre pure mush. You could not lift the sliced without the centre of the slices falling through. All that was edible was the crust and the tomatoes that did not make it past the plate without falling. Unfortunately for approximately $17 bucks this was a tad disappointing. However service was great and their desert menu never ceases to disappoint. We had the ever promising flavorful tiramisu and the apple fritter and Icecream dessert. Both top picks in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night for dinner with some other friends. We didn't make reservations but we asked to be put on the list for both inside and outside (so we could just have our pick when the time came). The weather was so nice so we decided to wait for the patio which was nice cause they had cushions for us to sit on outside to wait. When we finally got in 20 min later we were greeted by our waitress and we all shared a bottle of wine, I had the naked mozerella which was amazing and the zucca which I wasn't sure I would like but it blew me right out of the water it was so good! It was easy for the waitress to split the bill which included splitting the price of the bottle of wine we had. 
I cant wait to go again! Best Italian food I've had"}
{"text":"First and foremost, we had a wonderful and charming server, Megan (Beatrice - from St Johns New Brunswick). Arrived about 5:30 - gorgeous venue - exposed brick, a mix of hip but cozy. Started with the house-made mozzarella - made while you wait - yum. Its delicious as was the tomato jam. We decided to try  the house special. Lage, angus beef meatballs. They were exactly how you would want a meatball - seasoned just right, dense but moist. Just good. Huge, you only need to order one. You can get it naked, on a bun or on a bed of house-made spaghetti. We went naked and spaghetti. Pasta was yummy and filling - enough for 2 to share. Because it was my lovely mom's birthday, we got a free dessert - a molten chocolate cake in a glass jar. Very good, not too sweet but delicious.  Perfect - fresh mozzarella starter, mixed green salad, naked meatball and a meatball with pasta - $49CAD. PS - saw the pizza on the way out - we are already planning our next trip!!!"}
{"text":"Part of the Jack Astor's group, this particular restaurant opened in 2017. More like a 4,5 stars. My fiancé and I came by here after a Kay's game and it was packed during dinner. Luckily, we reserved ahead of time.

The decor was fashioned with wood throughout giving an antiquity look...great effect.

We've been to many franchised Italian restaurant s like Olive Garden or East Side Mario's but this one is the best. They make their meals from their own ingredients including their sauce and many Pastas.

We ordered their signature the country bread with three cheese, there spaghetti with one home made meatball with pepperoni and cheese inside while I got the roasted chicken featuring ghonoroc pasta. We got French Red wine and topped it off with their fan fav Tiramisu and green tea with Amaretto.

This place is great for family and large groups and the service was nice and fast. A lot of parking available which is always a plus. They do have specials during the week and offer gluten free food.

Tons of kids. They were given croyons and they drew on the paper table cloth. $$-$$$"}
{"text":"it was just alright. We had a variety of dishes, would recommend the bread and pesto fettuccine. We also had pizza calamari squash ravioli, snapper was just ok. The cake is jar is good. There's no good Italian food up town in the area so not their fault. Wouldn't visit here again unless we were desperate as we were today. Pricey for mediocre food."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Scaddabush's before, and they are usually okay. But this location is new and awesome.

The ambiance outside is relaxed when we were initially outside on the patio. Warm with a cool breeze at times. We has a few drink specials which change regularly. BUT the fresh mozzarella was AMAZING. Drool...... I was sharing with my friend, but I was about to kick him an take them all for myself. Its a definite try, I don;t think you will be disappointed.

It began to rain and we went inside. Inside was relaxed and more for groups or dates. Not really a bar-ish environment. But really nice especially for a relaxed evening out. I had the Spaghetti and Meatballs for dinner, and it was pretty good. Had a few whiskeys on the rocks as well. I was filled by the end of the night. 

The total cost for a long night and lots of food for 2 grown (yes I consider myself grown) men was about $140, split down $70 each. Was a bit costly, but we were there from about 7pm-11pm and ate a lot. 

They even gave us some complimentary donuts in chocolate fonduu :P (I like saying it that way) since they had to move us in cause of the rain.

Definite recommend going here, I really enjoyed myself that night."}
{"text":"Went to this Scaddabush a couple times, this time for a birthday. 

The ambiance of this location is the best of them all to be honest. usually more relaxed with some awesome lighting and music.

The waiter was okay, but automatically assumed we were Indian and started writing hindi on the table trying to show off that he could. We looked at him since no one could understand it :P We thought it was a bit funny.

We ordered a Mozzarella Prosciutto, which was yummy. Not the best, but we enjoyed this one. I guess it is true what they say, you need to know the person making it to know if to order it. I ordered the Italian Burger, but was okay.

Though I like the location, the experience this time was not the most amazing so I leave it as \"A-OK\". Hopefully another visit surprises me."}
{"text":"Started off really bad.... Came to have a nice sister dinner out at 830pm. Was told to wait 45 mins!!!! We said whatever and went to get a Starbucks while we waited. 1h later.... we got sat and waited another 15 mins for our waitress.  This place has such bad service. 

Finally ordered a pizza, salad & Calimari. Waited for another really long time. One the plus side, they had a really good dj that make me forget about the shitty situation.  I was starving!!! 

Finally got our food and we Wolfed it down in 10 minutes.  It was good. Probably will not go back. It was way to busy."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna go into details cause I'm pretty sure other Yelp reviews explain pretty much what we went through! Service is TERRIBLE, food was good but I've had better overall experience at the square one location in every aspect. From ambience to service start to finish. Their restaurant isn't bad just don't go to the Scarborough location! They seriously need to rehire most employees there, especially the manager. Top 5 top 5 top 5 for worst service! Pretty much...1 star for food and ZERO effort."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and quite like it. The staff is pretty friendly although not always competent, but hey nobody is perfect. Sometimes they were slow and unresponsive and other times they were TOO responsive and were trying to clear plates that weren't even finished! In the summer you can eat outside on their patio, which is more like a row of tables on the sidewalk.

The inside is pretty huge with really high ceilings and it can get pretty loud. The food itself is pretty good Italian style food. The pizza is pretty good, and the meatball is the bomb. This is a good place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Great place for birthdays or large groups. I called several places and its hard to get reservations for groups of over 10 people on a Saturday night in downtown Toronto without huge deposits or set menus!! The food is good, my vegan friends loved the veggie pizza! The inside is beautiful and in the evening the candles definitely adds to the ambiance. Ask for the second floor of you have a big group, it's much more intimate and decorated with the chandeliers"}
{"text":"Spagetti was good but it was WAY too crowded and WAY too loud. Blasting music from a dj who wasn't good at all. Couldn't even have a conversation at the table while speaking loudly."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is a solid restaurant, depending on what you order. The atmosphere reminds me of an updated, modern version of the Old Spaghetti Factory. The restaurant is pretty large, with a big lounge, and dining seating on two floors. I've seen a DJ at the restaurant at night sometimes, and it can get really loud in the lounge to the point where you can't speak to each other. 

What I like: Scaddabush makes fresh pasta and pizza dough and fresh mozzarella. I love that these items are made fresh. The Zucca ravioli (~17 for a small) is delicious. Butternut squash ravioli, with a super creamy sauce and sage. You just can't beat that combination. The fresh mozzarella is also amazing. The Blood Orange Soda was a nice non-alcoholic drink to have at lunch. It was made with freshly squeezed blood orange, soda and some citrus. The soda was tangy and sour without being too sweet. 

What I don't like: Some of Scaddabush's dishes are rather bland. I've tried the bolognese, and it just didn't taste like much. The pizza is also average. The Americano pizza (~$16) is a pretty classic pepperoni pizza with extra spice, and I like the toppings, but the pizza crust was quite soggy last time I had the pizza. The pizza ended up being pretty greasy, even for pepperoni/cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Overall, my group had a positive experience at Scaddabush. Service was very friendly, thoughtful, and reasonably patient and attentive (we had a medium sized group which experienced difficulties coming to a consensus as to what to order; I also broke a plate, whoops). We ordered the buratta, a couple of sociables, a pizza, and pasta.

The buratta was lovely and I would say is a must-order; I only regret not ordering the bomba buratta which is its larger brother that comes in a spicy pepper/tomato sort of hash in a cast iron pan. The calamari and polenta tots were good, and satisfied my craving for fried food. The bruschetta wasn't terrible and was actually attractively plated--- however, I found the balsamic glaze a little too much, and overwhelming the other flavours I expected of the other toppings on a bruschetta. The same could be said for the diavolo pizza, which I expected more heat from (at least that's what I thought it should be for something named after the devil)---the crust was acceptable.

Special mention to our waitress who without being asked, tried to split two of regular-serving pastas into two plates apiece (we tried to arrange the bill splitting when we ordered); in hindsight this made our lives more difficult as we decided after the fact that we would split all our pastas four ways, whoops again. We shared pesto pollo, shrimp spaghetti, fettucine capri, and lobster spaghetti. All were memorably delicious except perhaps the lobster spaghetti for which I would not order again; the lingering fishy undertaste, to me, indicates it was no longer fresh. The noodle itself had an acceptable bite to it (but then again, I'm rather indifferent to al dente pasta). Would love to try the spaghetti with stuffed meatball with Sunday sauce, the bolognese, and the ravioli the next time I visit."}
{"text":"So I had to update my review as I was here last night celebrating my friend's birthday.  The food was amazing as always and the service was great.  Alberto, our waiter, was super friendly and very attentive.  However, my friends and I ordered way too many appetizers and by the time our main meal arrived we were already full so we had asked to take it home.

I decided I was going to take my leftovers for lunch the next day (a lot of leftovers btw, I barely touched my food).  As I was eating my food, I realized I saw a piece of black hair on my chicken.  My hair is not black.  I then removed it and started stiring it around, another piece of black hair was stuck onto my pasta.  Right there and then I threw away my food.  I immediately lost my appetite and was very disappointed because I now did not have anything to eat for lunch and was upset that I had to throw away all that food.  My friends had also taken their leftovers for lunch and I texted them letting them know I had found hair in my food.  and for them to be careful.  One of my friends said they noticed hair in their food as well!

Moreover, I am now getting paranoid because I am now thinking there may have been hair in our food last night and we did not see it because it is so dark in that restaurant.  I am so upset and disgusted.  Chefs/waitresses should always have their hair away from the food. For goodness sake tie your hair or wear a hairnet!  It truly is not appealing to see hair in your food, especially if your expecting great food from Scaddabush! 

The food is amazing but I definitely don't think it's worth coming back to eat hair :("}
{"text":"Great ambiance, delicious food and strong drinks. Been here a few times during my visit to GTA area. Standard fare of Pizza, Pasta and Salads. Service is fantastic and the Charity bread is most delicious with butter and garlic ladden all over. If you are on a date, DO NOT order the Charity bread...unless your date also eats some...LOL"}
{"text":"Decent italian food. It seemed like a pretty versatile place, also not that pricey. With low ish lighting and modern decor, i would say its a good place for a quick dinner with friends, drinks or a date. 

Ordered the chicken parmesan bites and carbonara. Everything was pretty tasty! Seemed like i missed out on the mozzarella which they're known for (not available after 11pm) but maybe next time."}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE the Mississauga location, it never does me wrong. But the food here just doesn't live up to the Scaddabush hype. 

My favourite dish, the Pesto Pollo was severely lacking flavour, and I KNOW this dish because I've had it countless times at the other location. 

We had ordered garlic & rosemary fries as part of our starters, and the server brought regular fries. Even after I asked him if these were Garlic and Rosemary, he told me to \"smell them\" to try and deceive us?! If you don't have the fries, just let us know, we could have ordered something else as starters. 

Overall, a disappointment, I will continue to go to the one in Mississauga and never come to the one here again."}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience here but tonight was not our night. It was really busy, so I understand the slower service but somethings I couldn't look past. We sat beside a table who took pictures the WHOLE TIME with flash in our eyes and when we told our server he told us there's nothing he could do and to basically suck it up. It took while to order, but our server, Alfredo, wasn't very attentive. We had to ask for drink refills which was unusual for here as well. The server just looked like he didn't want to be around. 

Service 3.5/5
Food 5/5 
Experience 2/5

We may come back but probably not for a while."}
{"text":"Come here every so often, mostly for the fresh mozzarella and fresh pasta, it's surprisingly competent for a chain restaurant.

Order the truffle mozzarella to share with someone, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: House made mozzarella, need I say more?

Every now and then, life throws a surprise your way, and in this case, it's a chain resto that doesn't suck. Judging by the quality of their food, you'd never know that it was the same owners as Jack Astors! Located on the ground floor of the Aura condos, Scaddabush (along with Reds Tavern and Duke's Refresher) are run the by same management. The staff have always been professional and, perhaps as a nod to our changing times, thankfully not all ridiculously scantily clad. The interior is cavernous and the area is divided into more of  sports bar area, but there various sections walled off so that you can host more private events. Exposed brick, edison bulbs. Check. Prices - very decent. 

The highlight, of course is the food. You pretty much have to their MOZZARELLA WITH PROSCIUTTO, and their BURATTA is very good as well. If you're gonna get their MEATBALLS, get it STUFFED - it's worth the 60 cents. I've never actually ordered any of their pastas, but my DCs have had good things to say about the CAPRI. For me, I almost always get their thin-crust pizzas, especially the DIAVOLO, which probably has way more kick to it than you would expect (and that's a good thing). It's nice that they give you a ginormous pair of scissors to cut it with. 

Their beer selection isn't the greatest - it's too bad they couldn't share some taps with Duke's next door), and you're relegated to either Moretti (aite), or your usual big brewers. They to make some standard cocktails and offer a fair selection of wines. Either way, you'll probably find something you like."}
{"text":"So excited to have this Italian restaurant by college town! You must come here for dinner and try their fresh mozzarella, it was definitely a highlight of our meal. Meatball was ok but their pasta and kale salad were also amazing. They also make their own pasta noodles daily. A great place to have a decent meal without the high price tags!"}
{"text":"Great environment, friendly staff and great food! Bailey served with a welcoming smile. Wide variety of food to choose from (veggie, gluten free etc). I got the pesto pollo fettuccine and it's pretty good for a not-so-authentic Italian cuisine (what I always get)."}
{"text":"First time coming here with a friend. Nice atmosphere for hanging out. Service was good, we asked for recommendations as it's our first time here. She suggested the fresh mozzarella, meatball spaghetti pasta, and the butcher pizza. We decided to try out with Buratta Fresh Mozzarella and Capri pasta. 

The bread for mozzarella was really good, with the honey flavour. I don't think I would get it again because it was too cheesy for us. Capri pasta with seafood was average - wished the dish was hotter, it was just barely warm. 

Overall, the food is average but it's a nice atmosphere to chat and relax with friends so I might come back again and try something else. Their pizzas looked good, we'd probably get that with Charity Bread next time."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night the other day and it was pretty good. My first impression was it was exactly like the twin of Alice Fazooli's but after taking a look at the menu I thought it was a lot more authentic and novel. 

First off the bread - I love bread and I go out of my way to tell people to take the bread away or I will eat it. However, one of my friends insisted the bread was so good here we had to get it. That's right, instead of telling people to take our bread away, we actually went out of our way to order and pay a premium to have bread on our table. Just on principle it felt so wrong but I caved when she insisted it was the best bread ever. Admittedly, the bread was really good but probably not worth the guilt I felt afterwards.

Drinks here were good, no complaints there. We ordered their fresh mozzarella which was AMAZING. I really, really liked it. It was fresh, flavourful and came with crostini and different sides. I could have just eaten that and been very happy. 

The waitress recommended their meatball so I got that and it was huge and came in its own little skillet. Needless to say even though I shared, we couldn't finish it. It was good but I wish it wasn't stuffed with bacon and more fat. The whole evening was just me wrestling in my mind over whether I wanted to order what I actually wanted or if I wanted to be healthy. 

Bottom Line: Come here if you are prepared to indulge. This was definitely not a calorie friendly meal but to be fair the food was pretty good so no complaints :) 

Overall a fun, casual place for some good Italian food. I enjoyed it and would come again to indulge in their fresh mozzarella and wine."}
{"text":"My meal was yummy as always ... Pasta was on point especially the stuffed meatball ...I'm stuffed with happiness"}
{"text":"Delicious! We split the house made balsamic glaze mozzarella, it's a must have! I had the butternut squash ravioli. I ordered a small portion and it was the perfect size. My husband had the carbonara, which was pretty tasty, but would have been better if the huge, stringy chunk of pork was cut up a bit more. When asked if you want a side of bread with your meal, one order is enough for two. We will definitely return next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Always a good restaurant to fall back on. Their food has always been consistent Everytime I'm back visiting. I love their Italian burger, their pizzas and the spinach dip!"}
{"text":"I usually stay away from chain restaurants and now I remember the reason why. Food was underwhelming and they're overpriced. I went there on a Saturday night with the hubby at 5:00 and the only good thing about the experience was that we got seated right away. One lady said she was going to be our server, took our drink orders, and we never saw her again. Then as we were looking lost, another server came up and asked if she could take our order. Anyway, between the 2 of us, we ordered the margarita pizza and seafood pasta (regular size). Since we were sharing the pasta, they plated it separately for us - which was nice. While the pasta tasted quite fresh (they're made in-house), there were a few mussels and not much else. Think there was one shrimp and one scallop on my plate. When our pasta dishes arrived, they asked if we wanted fresh parmesan and pepper (of course!), then we had to wait for another server to come to our table with those items. The pizza was stone baked and came in an oblong shape with a pair of scissors. Since it was the margarita pizza, you can really taste the fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce and fresh basil. To finish off the meal, we ordered the cheesecake. I definitely remembered the cheesecake to be way better than it actually was. There was a dollop of something on top which taste like a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream that had melted and was re-frozen. Actually, the entire cheesecake tasted like that - that it had melted somewhat and a film had formed on the outside. All in all, that experience left a sour taste in my mouth and it's safe to say that I won't be back to Scaddabush any time soon."}
{"text":"It was my First time and I was not very impressed. I found Staff to be very Friendly, however very slow. It could mean that they are under staffed. It took forever for us to get our food and when we asked for refills on Drinks it was even slower. 
We sat out on the patio which was a very Nice ambience. 
Food was ok. Will most likely return, but not when I am in a hurry."}
{"text":"Came here lastnight and had a great experience again.. this was my 3rd time coming into this location last night. I love the stuffed meat balls and the same Zucca Pasta I Always get everytime I come here! I recommend this place and the funny thing is.. the waiter I had the first time ever going there with the great expereince, he was my waiter again and he still gives the same Great customer service. He maintains his customer service, you see that? This is what we need in more restaurants, lol.. Oh and I actually got to try the cheese ball.. iy came with sea salt and some sweet tangy jam and bread.. I couldn't keep my hands off this delicious cheese.. and I am not even a fan of to much cheese but I'd make an acception for this one."}
{"text":"The menu is incredible. You really can't go wrong with anything. They make their pasta and mozzarella onsite. The garlic (charity) bread is a must try. The staff are very well trained and can accommodate anything from tables for two up to corporate parties. I would recommend reservations if possible. Be advised if you are looking for a quiet place for dinner to catch up with a friend, this is not ideal. It can be loud but one of my favourite places for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with coworkers after a long day of meetings leaving us craving some good comfort food! The place was busy for a Thursday and seemed to be filled with many other young professionals there for the same reason we were.

The food was pretty standard - we all split the mozzarella to start, then I had a caesar salad and the Sophia pizza. Nothing really stood out to me as being bad or exceptional. My favourite part was probably the chocolate toffee jar cake for dessert, although it could have used more ganache as it was on the dry side."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Tasty and delicious and the service is great. Only thing that I would recommend is if the staff at the fresh mozzarella stand could wear gloves. Saw one staff member continually scratch is nose on the outside and then form the mozzarella.  Passed on that after seeing that :("}
{"text":"Food was exceptional and service was fabulous.  Louis took great care of my boyfriend and I and reassured we had the best possible experience.  Would definitely return for the stuffed meatballs alone but everything else we tried was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This review would have been 5 stars except the music was way too loud, it sounded like a night club, pretty hard to talk.

The food was outstanding, the fresh mozzarella was just to die for. I had the smoked bacon and egg pizza, amazing!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here Jan 4, 2018 for their National Spaghetti Day Celebration! 

One of the coldest days 2018, I was seated near the door by the bar with a wintery drift. Even with the storm door, I could still feel the bitter winter winds. I could understand if the restaurant was packed but not when it was not even busy. Single diner problem as those are the only 2 tops available.

Shrimp Spaghetti ~ Wine cream, lemon and garlic butter, fresh basil, fried capers, picante sauce, spicy poor man's Parmesan  ($17 at 50% off)  was a steal with the special offering. Love the chewiness and texture of freshly made pasta. Shrimps were plentiful but I wish for more pasta! 

Service was fast and friendly. 

PS I kind of wish they still have Lobster Spaghetti on the menu though."}
{"text":"Don't normally go to this part of town but this restaurant was recommended to me. My husband and I split the avocado bruschetta, a chicken pizza, and a tiramisu and everything was super delicious. The service was good, and our bill only came to $70 which is pretty decent for a dinner for two which included a bottle of red wine. Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back and try their pasta."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 or 6 times now... always at lunch time. Overall the service has been good and the food is above average. I've had a few OK dishes (Bolognese), as well as a few that I quite like (Arrabiata & Napoli)... good location, quick service, with a relaxing atmosphere. Definitely recommend as a good spot for lunch in the area. Area doesn't have much."}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about Scaddabush's downtown location, so jumped at the opportunity to try it when I was in Mississauga. They have a good menu with lots of options, and they are good about doing substitutions or modifications - my coworker ordered a pizza and asked to have the chicken removed. I ordered the Sophia pizza which had marinated chicken, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, tomato sauce, and fresh basil. It was not anything particularly special or interesting, a pretty simple kind of pizza. I thought it was quite flavourful and filling, although quite a bit greasier than I would have liked. It was not a full sized round pizza, but rather a rectangular-ish shape on a slab of wood. It came uncut, but accompanied by a large pair of ominous-looking scissor-like utensils. While the pizza itself tasted fine (it was good, but not amazing), I was slightly turned off by the fact that I had to a) cut my own pizza (the scissor things were effective but a bit unwieldy), and that the pizza was so messy to eat and also too oily. The pizza was too hard to saw through with a knife and fork, so I had no choice to use my hands at times, and they ended up completely dripping and covered in grease. Now I know pizza is meant to be finger food, and I appreciate a good messy meal every once in a while, but I felt like I had just dipped my entire hand in a vat of oil. Not the greatest feeling. That being said, wouldn't mind coming back to try their pastas (at least my hands will stay clean then) or other menu items, but wouldn't get a pizza again - in my opinion it's just more trouble than it's worth."}
{"text":"Thought this place was going to be more of a \"non-chain\" restaurant that prides itself on quality and personal meals. I was wrong, it tasted like just another chain food ie frankies, or bar type food. It was beyond average and expensive."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with colleagues, food took more than 40 minutes to arrive (the restaurant was not busy at all). This seems to be the norm as I've been here on several other occasions (dinner as well) and it took just as long. The food is hit or miss as I ordered the same pasta dish on separate occasions and got two different tasting dishes. The atmosphere is nice, the food is just ok and the service is consistently slow."}
{"text":"First meal during my stay in Toronto over the summer was here and it was amazing! Haven't had pasta so good in a long time  (aside from Carmines)! On top of that, its located directly across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel, where we stayed. The food was fresh, delicious,  and the attentive customer service was the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"Id go here again! The cheese platter is amazingly AMAZING. Cant have enough of that cheese. Pizzas here are great! Id go back again. Its better than yiur daily commercial pizza places. Good food ans good time!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the birthday bash and comparing to the last time I came here (last year), the servers were different (treated us hundred times better and they treated us with sample pasta. I don't know if they started that thing recently or this was been a thing if you sit on the biggest table in that restaurant. They were patient with the big groups, very caring and overall I underestimated this place just because of a bad experience"}
{"text":"I went with my friends on a Tuesday night and I have to say, their service was pretty awesome. Our server was attentive, promptly refilled our empty water containers, and served us food all in a timely manner. For a table of 8, we didnt wait very long for all of our food to arrive; which was amazing since we didnt have to wait until our food is cold to begin eating. 

Four of us decided to share, so we ended up getting quite a few selections from their menu. Their calamari and polentas were extremely well done, I loved the chili oil dipping sauce the calamari came with. The bruschetta was good, and the buratta was a very interesting app (it was the first time ive tried this). I probably would order the spicier version of it to try next time I come back. The pastas we ordered were all very delicious. I highly recommend the shrimp spaghetti, the sauce was beautifully done with plenty of tender shrimp on the side. The poor man's parmesan was crunchy on top, making every bite an experience. 

The only thing I did not enjoy was the diavolo pizza. The balsamic vinegar was wayy too strong, it was all i could taste when I bit into it. I could barely finish 1 slice. 

Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, I would definitely come back to dine again. On a side note our server was awesome as she split the bills perfectly for us without mistakes. Bonus!! :)"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time as part of a Yelp event on Monday night.
The manager explained to us that they are considering revamping the somewhat staid Alice Fazoolis brand and this is their dry run; if all goes well with this locations then they will convert all the existing restaurants to the new, classy Italian style eatery. The decor is nice and warm, if a bit dark. They have a lovely patio which is decorated with flowers and is isolated from the parking lot, making it a peaceful haven. The inside was very loud though, by the end of the 2 hours I had a headache from trying to make myself heard. I feel like they could use some sound-deadening, all the hardwood doesn't help. The service certainly was enthusiastic and quick. It seems the bruschetta didn't make its way to us but we sampled the pizza, meatball sliders and the cheese with fig jam all of which were very tasty. The food is fresh and well-made.  Their blood orange Bellini was ok, I think I prefer the ones at Milestones. I would recommend this place because of the quality of the food, but be warned the noise level isn't really conducive to conversation."}
{"text":"It's a shame.

The fresh mozzerella is pretty darned tasty!  Actually, it's pretty fantastic!

Unfortunately, Scaddabush music is so painfully loud, that conversation is next to impossible. 

For some reason best known to their parent company, SIR, Management refuses to lower the volume. (BTW.  SIR stands for Service Inspired Restaurants....Can you say, irony, anyone?!)

Even though I know from speaking with staff throughout SIR's restaurants (Jack's and Scaddabush), that more than JUST a couple of very nice, talented and YOUNG, 23 to 30 year old staffers now suffer from significant hearing loss.  PERMANENT DAMAGE, my fellow yelpers. 

And.  A hoarse, sore throat and a headache were most definitely NOT the free bonus with purchase that I was looking for."}
{"text":"It's a shame really.  That the music is soooooo loud that you could LITERALLY go deaf eating here.  Conversation is next to impossible.

Cause their fresh mozzarella is exquisite!  (bread was too crispy/over-toasted for me personally, but that's easy to fix!  And the cheese, with fig and prosciutto....omg!)

I begged the manager, Ronald Wong, to turn the music down.  I told him I was afraid that I'd leave with a migraine.

He refused.

FOR 10 minutes.

His exact words?

\"The music is part of the atmosphere.  I have all my guests to consider, not just you.  I don't care if other restaurants turn it down.  WE DON'T TURN THE MUSIC DOWN HERE\".  Over and over.  10 or 15 times at least.  I gave up and left....VERY MUCH MISSING THE CANYON CREEK THAT WAS THERE UNTIL NOVEMBER.

For some reason, best known to their parent company, SIR, Jack's and Scaddabush refuse to play music at a reasonable, appropiate volume FOR A RESTAURANT. (BTW.  SIR stands for service inspired restaurants....Can you say, irony, boys and girls?  I think it's too late!)

Scaddabish, and their parent company,  SIR, apparently don't believe in customer service.  Or that the customer is often right!  OR IN BASIC COURTESY.  SERIOUSLY.  

It's a REAL shame.  Scaddabush seems to want to be a college bar, rather than a restaurant. 

I also know, from speaking with staff throughout SIR's restaurants (Jack's and Scaddabush), that more than JUST a couple of talented and YOUNG, 23 to 30 year olds, are suffering from significant hearing loss.  PERMANENT DAMAGE, my yelping friends.  And that few, if any of them, have 5 to 7 THOUSAND dollars they will soon need for hearing aids. 

As a migraine sufferer, I left with a migraine.....so thanks for that \"unpaid bonus!\".

And no one has contacted me to discuss this issue, OR the deplorable conduct by Mr. Wong.

IS this a bar?

Or a restauarant?

It is a shame!  But Via Allegro, a GENUINE Italian restaurant, is 30 seconds away, beside Staples....risottos, lamb, pastas, branzino,  etc, are all spectacular!"}
{"text":"I will start out by saying our server was great, incredibly apologetic.  Here's what went wrong and right.  Upon arriving, it took 20 minutes to actually have someone come and wait on us.  We ordered drinks, very simple.  Diet Coke and Vodka on the rocks.  Needless to say, 15 minutes later I received a glass of ice.  They forgot the vodka.  It was not that busy at the time, if the bar staff was that overwhelmed they should find new bar staff.
The food was above average, I wouldn't say great, but very good.  They did give free desert but I was not impressed.  With all of the great options here in Toronto, it's debatable that I would go back."}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant and I'm glad that I get to try their other dishes on the menu. The first time was at their Toronto location. 

Love the interior decor for the one in Mississauga. A lot brighter than the one in Toronto. 

Happy:  I ordered chicken avocado flatbread with rosemary garlic fries. It was nicely displayed on a wooden board which I like the change from the traditional plate. The fries are crispy but I didn't taste the difference from normal fries. My friends ordered (a) stuffed meatballs and spaghetti and he was full that he had leftovers to take home, (b) steak with fries and arugula salad. He said he liked it and would order it again. The meat was chubby but he commented that it was a bit small in size.  

Not happy:  We all shared an appetizer of Parmesan chicken bites with 2 dip sauces. It came with crispy fried wonton strips which was oily and a surprise. There weren't a lot of chicken pieces. It could have came with something more refreshing than more fried stuff to filled up the bowl of chicken. 

Verdict:  If you join their mailing list, you get a coupon of $10 off your meal. They were nice enough to honour it to us even though we forgot to print it off. Since this is my third time at Scaddabush, I would definitely go back to it. With home made bread and pasta it certainly beats out the other franchise pasta restaurants. 

They will get competition when Jamie's Italian kitchen opens up in Square One in 2016. 

Happy New Year!! Eat well and enjoy life!"}
{"text":"the Pizza was very delicious with fresh Mozzarella and basilicum! penne arrabiata was also pretty good. i must mention the bruschetta, they tasted like Heaven! The Patio is small but very nice, the restaurant itself is quite noisy and dark. thats why i give 4 out of 5 Stars. i would definitely eat and drink there again! the mango peach bellini was very sweet but it tasted so good !"}
{"text":"We had the shrimp spaghetti and penne bolognese with a side of rosemary(?) fries. The dishes were all very average. The spaghetti was quite salty and the penne was very bland. Had no trouble finding a seat for two on a Thursday evening. The ambience of the restaurant is nice, with a lot of background noise and dim lights; it's overall a good place to sit and talk. I'd come back to grab some drinks and finger food but wouldn't die to recommend for dinner :-)"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a few weeks ago for dinner. The ambience was very lively (they had a dj!) and the waitresses are attentive. Although it could be a little loud for conversation. My friend and I had to raise our voices. There is a bar area where you can drink and watch sports and there was dining area with booths and tables. They have a lot of seats and the interior is very pretty. 
As for food, we ordered Tuscan salad ($12.23), classic spaghetti & stuffed meatball ($16.52), and Sophia pizza ($15.23). All our dishes were DELICIOUS! Apparently their mozzarella cheese was made fresh daily, and the pasta and pizza were handmade as well. The spaghetti was very different from what I used to have: it's more dense and firm(?!), in a good way. And the meatball was divine too.
Overall a pleasurable experience, and I'm definitely gonna come back for other items and will recommend to others for a nice, casual dinner."}
{"text":"Been there many times with BF and kids. This review is pertaining to my experience on Friday August 8th.

My boyfriend and I decided this restaurant as the destination for our lunch date. I was on vacation and my bf was done for the day so we weren't in any big hurry. He arrived first and got us a booth seat in the bar area, I arrived about 15 minutes later. When I arrived I noticed this large party next to us...I would say about 12 people.

We placed our order along with a soft drink and glass of wine. After a little while we started to get hungry and was wondering where are food was. I did mention to bf, that the large party probably ordered first so the kitchen would need to get their order first. Sure enough I was right.  Our order came out shortly after they were served...I would say we waited maybe 20-25 minutes. Not too bad.

We ordered Polenta Tots (unbelievably tasty), Margherita Pizza and a dinner salad. Everything was as delicious as usual. We even ordered the tiramisu for dessert. Believe me....I took a lot home!!!!

When it came time for the bill, the waitress says...you will only be paying for the drinks and dessert as your lunch took longer then 15 minutes!!!!! Can you believe it!!! We were shocked and impressed. I asked her if this was a normal thing for them and she said yes, this is part of our loyalty program; we want our customers coming back. 

You can be assured...we will be back!! Thank you Scaddabush for understanding what customer service truly means!"}
{"text":"New location in Etobicoke and 2nd time at a scaddabush.  Ordered the peach Bellini  which was amazing blood orange Bellini was too slushy and flavourless so we returned for another peach one. Had a Tuscan salad that was good but a bit too much dressing that was over powering at the end. Grilled vegetable sandwich was foiled with red peppers that were too tart with vinegar but the rosemary fries as a side were very tasty.  The seafood pasta was subpar as it was bathed in a way too salty sauce shrimps were tasty though.  The desert of tiny donuts with hazelnut sauce was a good finish to the salt overloading. Service was pleasant and timely. Atmosphere was nice and well decorated."}
{"text":"My second visit here was much better because I ordered the right dishes this time I think. The carbonara pasta was pretty decent and the caprese salad was delicious once again. The naked mozarella was awesome and very unique. This place is a solid 4/5 as long as you avoid the spaghetti and meatballs (overly salty) and garlic fries (overly sour). The service was great and the atmosphere is pretty nice too."}
{"text":"This Scaddabush is just as good as the one in downtown Toronto, which is fantastic.

Our group ordered the naked mozarella to start, and it was delicious as usual. I highly recommend it for sharing. I ordered the chicken avocado BLT, which was huge and delicious as well. I got the Caesar salad, which was also fantastic an didn't taste like your typical Caesar salad.  There was definitely more bite to it, which I like. It was also a nice touch that the waitress offers you shaved parmesean cheese and not that cheap Kraft stuff.

Lastly, the atmosphere is very nice and modern. The service was also friendly and very efficient. The waitress even offered to split the appetizer cost for our group without requesting it.

All in all, this is a great place for a date or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"The food is OK-I was really excited about the mozzarella bar. But that's nothing spectacular.

I've been on three occasions now-and only keep returning because they give us free dinners because the service is so bad. In fact the last time the waitress said \"we have a special free dessert we give customers when we provide bad service...\" Imagine,  a desert dedicated to their bad service! LOL

I've been served appetizers before mains, beverage orders never arriving, and other peoples food. Our checks have been wrong, and even when corrected still wrong. I've been ignored for up to half an hour at a time, and managers promised to adjust tabs and then forget to do so.

Seriously, I am a fussy diner from a food quality perspective, but I have great compassion for waiters. It was not us being bitchy, it was definitely a poorly managed staff. 

I still have yet another free dinner offered, but I don't think I'll bother to go back. The food is not worth the aggravation, and in general it is a rather loud restaurant, which is not something I prefer."}
{"text":"If you love yourself, and you should, get the fresh mozzarella. 

If you don't live yourself, get the fresh mozzarella and learn what true love is.

Fresh ingredients, fun ambiance, amazingly friendly and fun servers, you can't miss. I'm partial to the fresh pasta, signature non alcoholic drinks, and the charity bread."}
{"text":"This is your regular pizza, pasta place. Unfortunately I found a hair in my pasta and it really killed it for me. There is too many servers that keep changing at your table. And the place can get quiet noisy"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to scaddabush on Sunday evening. It was our first time dinning there and we sat on the patio. I usually don't write reviews but for this restaurant I will. The food was very delicious and the items are a decent price. Our server was very attentive and friendly. He recommended items on the menu and demonstrated great knowledge of the food. We started with the Bomba burrata mozzarella, it was quite delicious and had a bit of a spicy flavour which I enjoyed. We then had the penne sorrentina and the caprese salad. Both of which we highly enjoyed. Finally we ended with dessert, chocolate panna cotta. Definitely would order that again. A side note is that I noticed people of all ethnicities working there which I think contributes to the restaurants comfortable atmosphere. I highly recommend people try out scaddabush and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is located across the street from hotel and thought I'd give it a try. Great choice. Mark was super knowledgeable about the dishes and had great suggestions for us. Homemade Mozzarella was amazing. Thanks Mark"}
{"text":"I was directed to this restaurant by the concierge of Sheraton Wall Centre because he said this place had the best modern Italian food he has ever had. 

The decor was great because the plates and chairs were not matching and the light fixtures were not your conventional lamps and bulbs. 

The waitress told us that the pasta, mozzarella and meatballs were freshly made. So we chose the Naked for our first appetizer which was freshly made mozzarella with extra-virgin olive oil, focaccia crostini, San Marzano tomato jam and sea salt. I absolutely adored the tomato jam and wished there was more. The mozzarella was good too and I would order this dish again any time.  Our second appetizer was the Osso Bucco Bites. It consist of Italian dry spice pork, pappardelle crisps, chili rosemary honey and Grana Padano. It was a sweet, salty and crispy dish which was pretty good. 

For our main, we ordered the Pesto Pollo, Social Spaghetti & Meatball stuffed, Tuscan Salad and Bianca pizza. The pasta was disappointing as it was not Al Dente and was definitely over cooked. The meatball wasn't really impressive either, just a meatball with some kind of stuffed meat. However, the Tuscan Salad was the best thing I had all night. The marinated raisins, toasted pumpkin seeds, semi sun-dried tomatoes and the balsamic lemon vinaigrette was the highlight of that dish. It was packed with flavour and had that it factor. I had never tasted anything like it before and I would eat plates of it. This is a must order. The pizza was delightful as the sun dried tomatoes and herbs made the pizza extra fragrant and the crust had the right thickness. 

The dessert was the second best part of the meal. I received a birthday dessert which was the Zeppole with a sparkler. The deep fried sweet dough was light and airy and the chocolate hazelnut dipping sauce was obviously liquidized Nutella but no one was complaining. The best dessert of that night was hands down the chocolate panna cotta. It was my first time trying it and it was a treat. Cold and light chocolatey panna cotta with Lindt chocolate shavings and dollops of whip cream. YUM! The almond biscotti was crisp and acted as a great scoop for the panna cotta. 

All in all it was a pretty good birthday dinner. I wasn't needed to be rolled out the door which was a good thing but my tummy was satisfied."}
{"text":"I came here once on a Wednesday night to celebrate a special occasion. I had the best service I could possibly ask for, kudos to Greg for the personable service. We also received a complimentary serving of bruschetta since we said it was our first time. 

The food itself was alright, the giant meatball was excellent! The pasta on the other hand, not exactly my favourite. I got the bolognese and my friends ordered the baked carbonara. The carbonara was delicious! Very tasty and strong, perfect for a cold winter night. The bolognese on the other hand, was not to my liking. It was not al dente like I expected (though I guess that is a preference) and it stuck together like a ball. Nevertheless, decent food for fair prices. 

Would come back."}
{"text":"Uhm.. okay what happened here? 

The first visit was amazing, I literally suggested this place to my family and friends. During my last visit, the service was.. not so great. Myself and 3 other friends decided to go here for dinner because we all wanted either pasta or pizza and we were nearby. Our waitress was not the best. At one point she was yelling at one of her coworkers like crazy, and all of us were just staring. Literally, staring. That was scary to watch, because there was loud music in the back yet all your hear is her yelling at the poor coworker. The coworker looked like she was going to burst into tears and she just walked away. For some reason, whenever we asked for something, e.g. drinks, a straw, forks, etc., it took FOREVER to arrive that day. She also showed me attitude once when I asked her for a straw.. like seriously? 

Okay, so let's get to the food. Three of us got pasta, and one of my friends ordered pizza. About 16 minutes into us ordering (yes I seen the time because I was on my phone), she comes and tells us there is no dough for the pizza and my friend had to order something else. How do you not have dough when it's only 9pm on a Thursday night?! It's not even Friday or Saturday? Either way, my friend decided to get a pasta as well, our food arrived pretty late (considering she brang it to us altogether). I can't lie, our food was so good! I got the chicken and shrimp spaghetti and it was amazing!! 

Def. changed like crazy since my last visit!"}
{"text":"Scaddabush offers a consistent range in pasta and cheese (mozzarella specifically). The ambience is nice, although there was a performance going on which is very loud. It was not noticeable as it took place near the bar, whereas we were sitting on the other side (it is a fairly large restaurant).

The service was not necessarily bad, but the servers were not at all attentive. It took very long for a waiter to notice us. The waiter that sat us down, simply handed us our menus, said nothing, and moved on to serving others.

Overall, I would not necessarily suggest this restaurant for those who get frustrated with lack of service. But, the food was relatively delicious."}
{"text":"A late review . Have dined here with friends before ,and I am a fan. Love the  Fresh mozzarella and the Fresh Pasta Dishes. 
My only issue is that  the lighting is too dim for my liking.  Please increase the lighting by 25 % so that we can see the menus with ease, and take pictures of our food without using flash"}
{"text":"Place here isn't too bad but I'm not big on paying 20 bucks for pasta especially when it's something you can make at home. 

The polenta taters were a little too salty for me."}
{"text":"Very very average. 

Not worth the price $20/dish. 

We got the mozzarella ball appetizer and the mozarella was small and very hard - did not live up to the hype. 

I got the vegetarian pasta and it was again, mediocre. 

If the menu items were less than $10 then this would probably be a 4 star but for the price, it's definitely not worth it. 

You're probably off at Canyon Creek or even Moxies in the area."}
{"text":"Came here a few times. I love the Meatball though I have to say I don't recommend getting the stuffed as with the peperoni it becomes overly salty. I assume they don't account for that. The spaghetti was really good and fresh. LOVE the mozzarella so I recommend getting anything with the fresh mozzarella (like the caprese salad).

Service though is what brought this place down for me. The first time we ate here it was pretty busy. Service was a bit standoffish. I don't know if the guy was having a bad day or whatever but it was a little rude. We attributed the length it took to get our food out due to how busy the restaurant was at the time and often times I believe our table was forgotten.

The second time we came to eat we came at an odd time. Even when the restaurant is pretty empty, it is really hard to flag down any waiters or waitresses. It got to the point where the bartender had to come over to our table to take our order after we had been waiting half an hour in a relatively empty restaurant. Even then, food was slow coming out and we had to wait an indecent amount of time just to have our drinks refilled.

While the food was good (fresh tasting, and well cooked), the service was really subpar. I would have liked to give this restaurant a higher rating because the food is very good, but the service is a really big let down and does ruin the overall experience when you feel like you've paid money to be forgotten or overlooked."}
{"text":"Scaddabush is RADabush

Yes, that's right. I just called this place rad (short for radical, as in awesome, for those who aren't \"in\" with the lingo) 

My girlfriend took me here for a date night on a friday evening. So needless to say it was packed. We had to wait over 30 minutes for a seat but damn, it was worth it.

I would literally get naked for their naked mozzarella appetizer. 

It consists of fresh mozzarella, crostini, tomato jelly, and sea salt (see picture). It was delicious. For a main, I split a bacon carbonara pasta dish with my girl. It was amazing but her and I are fans of bacon carbonara so perhaps that's bias. . . but it was actually really good. You can tell that they use fresh ingredients.  To drink, we split a blood orange bellini, which was good but a little pricy. 

The reason why I award Scaddabush 5 stars is because I was so impressed with their service. Their fresh mozzarella appetizers are typically only served until 9 pm, and we arrived at 9:30. My gf expressed some disappointed that we weren't able to order it and our waitress was like \"hold on, I'm going to go talk to the mozzarella maker\". Several minutes later she appears with the naked mozzarella!! We were so impressed and then even more impressed once we bit into it. 

So yeah, for their amazing food, and great service, this place deserves 5 stars. I like it infinitely better than the Alice Fazooli's. I'll be back again. Possibly naked."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by another local bar as a great place to eat.  We were specifically told to try the meatballs.  Boy, am I glad we listened because the food here is top notch.

The staff was very friendly.  Our waiter on the second night, Craig was wonderful and kept us stocked with drinks.  The atmosphere of Scaddabush is great.  It's nice and open, yet has a romantic feel to it if you're there for it.  The bar is nice and big, and there are several TV's with various sports.  

The food was just out of this word.  We tried the meatballs and let me tell you.  If you go here, try them.  If you go here and you're a vegan...well never mind but reconsider.  The meatball appetizer is delectable.  Bear in mind it's a big meatball!  For our main meals, the first time we split a pizza called The Butcher and I have to tell you, it was one of the best pizzas I have ever had in my life.  No, that isn't an exaggeration.  The second time we went, I had a the chicken Parmesan, and while the chicken itself was good, what blew me away was the pasta side.  It was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.  I would absolutely come back to this place next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Had to walk out...  

Went here on Weds @ 1730 hrs, very empty.  Requested to have a seat in a booth in the lounge area.  Out of the 4 booths, 1 was in use and the other 3 needed to be bussed.  The hostess obliged us and commented that it'll take a moment to clean the table.  Not a problem.  

While my companion and I wait, we notice several other tables that haven't been bussed.  There are at least one bartenders behind the bar, and three servers around the bar (casually chatting, I am also assuming one of which is a manager).  None of these people are helping bus nor perceived to be actually working.  I say \"perceived\" because they may be talking shop or awaiting a drink order (they're not because there are no chits for the bartender and she is clearly cleaning and doing prep work still).  

We are seated, and continue to observe the few employees socializing with one another.  We go over the menu a few times, and have waited several minutes now (it it wrong of me to have expectations of a SIR Corp restaurant employee greet us and introduce themselves as our server and inquire about drink orders once seated?).  Still nothing...  By now, my girlfriend and I have made the \"wanna leave\" eye contact, and we start getting up and are getting ready to leave.  The server comes over with a greeting and bottle of water as we are turning to leave.  He seems confused but is apologetic in our displeasure and we leave.  

I expect more from such an established franchise..."}
{"text":"Quite a busy place - came here with a group of 14 for a friends birthday dinner. 

Server was very knowledgeable about the menu but was too thorough. She highlighted everything on the menu, which means that it was hard to actually distinguish what was good. Appreciate her helpfulness though. 

We split the penne pollo and the Sophia pizza - def get the pizzas or pastas as that's their specialty. They have really cool pizza cutters too. The food is definitely above average and authentic Italian food. 

The bills took a while to get as the servers were slow. But all in all, it was a good night."}
{"text":"Stuck between giving 3 or a 4 stars only because my favourite pasta doesn't taste as good as it used to. They changed the type of pasta they used and it doesn't look visually appealing. 

We came on a Friday night around 830 for dinner to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I called on Thursday for a reservations but they don't accept reservations Friday-Sunday which sucks. Hostess told us there would be a 45 minute wait till next avail table but there was one small dinky one near the front that we took because we were starving. The place was really busy during that time (took a while to get our food) but the waitresses and food deliverers still kept in touch with us. Our table was so small, we had to put stuff on the bookshelf that was beside it. 

Biggest plus here is the mozzarella. This is made in house and I highly recommend to get the one with meat and fig jam. The combination of everything is amazing!! We always look forward to that when we come here. 

As for the pasta, I should really try something else. I've been getting the same one and giving it a chance each time but I get disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited Scaddabush with my mom a few afternoons ago. The place was pretty much empty, but I feel it was nicer this way! We got a waitress all to ourselves! It was our first time here, and the waitress was very kind and gave us a few extra minutes to peruse the menu and decide what we wanted to get.

We ended up splitting a kale (& raisin) salad, and a baked carbonara pasta dish. Both were very very delicious (although the kale salad was a bit overly acidic and too sweet at the same time).

Our whole meal was great! I wish I could remember the waitresses name, because she was a sweetheart!

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gather with some work colleagues to socialize and a nice meal.

I had a great time with my colleagues.

SERVICE
I was arrived 5 minutes early for a 6:15 reservation.
I was greeted immediately and was advised that our group table was just finished getting setup.
I was the first to be seated of our eight and with 5 minutes I was ask if I wanted a drink.  I chose a red wine and the hostess was also nice enough to advise me of a great entree pairing.  Once our remaining party showed up and were seated the server came by making some suggestions for drinks and entrees which we did end up trying.
Overall the service was good, our server checked in with us, the dishes were hot and everyone got there entrees at the same time.

FOOD
Starters - Mozarella (Naked and spicy roasted red peppers)
--- really good especially the one with spicy roasted peppers aka Bombatta (very likely spelled wrong). The cheese was melted and blended with the roasted red peppers served with some crustini.  Yum!  
--- the naked one was also very nice.  It had a different texture as it was served on a hot skillet.  It was very salty which I do prefer as it paired well with the crustini
--- Brushetta - loved it!  Plenty of tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  Again on some really yummy bread, soft on the inside and crunchy crust.
--- Charity Bread - I would considered this bread an elevated garlic bread.  Presented in a mini skillet the bread sits in garlic butter and topped with fresh parmesan.  Divine!
--- I specifically had the famous spaghetti and stuffed meatball.  It was great!  The pasta is made fresh in house everyday as is the mozzarella.  It was just one giant meatball.  The meatball was moist and it was good texture not dry or hard.  The fulling just give the overall meatball an extra kick.  The tomato sauce was also tasty.  Not sure if it is made in-house but the red was good.
--- Dessert we had the donuts.  Imagine a honey crueller but with more dough fried dusted with powdered sugar and melted Nutella to dip in.  It was a perfect treat to conclude our night.


DECOR
- Casual to dressed up
- small details - actual candles lit
-  rustic with wood top tables
- paintings on the wall of old Italian families in gold frames
- nice and comfortable


OVERALL
A pleasant experience and do rate it more of 4.5 stars.  Good food, service and ambience.
Looking forward to go again!"}
{"text":"EXCUUUSE firstly id like to point out that I am a huge fan of his franchise but I can't but feel... THAT U BEET ME THE HELL UP by not providing me with any beets in my goat cheese and BEET salad... I am very distraught and I'm here to insure that this never happens again! Thank you and goodbye.

{"text":"Been there twice now, found the food a bit greasy. Environment is a bit loud, had to yell to make our orders. Seemed more like a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"I made a reservation but ended up waiting about 20 minutes or more which is complete B.S. (And other customers were getting seated while the staffs apparently were \"clearing the table\" and then switching location last minute which took even more time. We then noticed we were the only ones at the entrance waiting but HELLO? What was the purpose of making a reservation then??? They even asked for confirmation email and this is what we get? It's called \"reservation\" for a reason...

Staffs need to be retrained, Food was alright, meatball was ok; bit dry and smaller than I thought, Napoli lacked in taste and did not have enough sauce (wish I had salt or something). Same with tiramisu, lots of mascarpone and not much of other ingredients like espresso etc. 

Atmosphere in other hand was very nice. Perhaps good place to have drinks and maybe something to nibble on but they need to work on the food and service in general. Word of advice: \"Don't be fooled by the looks guys!\""}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my brother. We decided to sit outside on the patio on a beautiful sunny day. The patio is nice but not every table has an umbrella so be careful because the sun can be hot. 

Service was just OK. The server too a while to show up and ask for our drinks and we could tell he was just there to do a job. He wasn't super friendly or engaging; he just took the order and brought the drinks. I think he checked up on us during the meal once. We did have to flag him down for another round of drinks and for the bill. 

The food was pretty good. We had the spinach and artichoke dip to start and then a red pasta (don't  remember the name - maybe the first option on the menu) and a salad with berries and added chicken breast. 

Overall we would return. Mostly for the ambiance and the variety on the menu."}
{"text":"We rushed in without reservation or plan - it was just too cold and the restaurant we planned to go was closed.

We were afraid that we ordered too much so we skipped the Italian wedding soup. However, the nice waiter gave us something similar for free, and it tastes awesome.

We ordered the charity bread for share, I think it's a must try. The garlic and oil on the bread made it so good, and the surface is crispy. We also shared the caprese salad, and it was ok. The tomato is a little different from the tomato we usually take.

The pasta I ordered is the Pesto Pollo. It is a nice try with fettucine. Unlike spaghetti, it's wider. I think I maybe prefer spaghetti more. The whole pasta dish tastes good. I like the way that the cheese is scrap from a bar of fresh cheese, instead of Parmesan cheese in a jar.

Overall a four star. Not five because there's nothing that surprised me (the bread perhaps?) to stimulate me to give it a excited 5 star, but it is definitely a great restaurant to try."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Atmosphere is perfect if you want something a little more relaxing than jacks. The main highlight for me was our server/bartender, one of the sweetest people I've met. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"The food was good. A bit more chicken on my huge kale salad would be great. Also the high booths are not comfortable for short people and little kids."}
{"text":"Been to this place 100 times and it's always a good time. The staff is great and the food is always delicious. They also have a great variety of drinks to appease your drinking style for the night. No dancing, but the music is good enough that you want to! The bar is always a good time!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, the place has a modern vibe with decent decoration. The music is way too loud for a restaurant. The cuisine is predominantly Italian, yet I was feeling like a steak that night. I know I shouldn't have done it but I took my chances and ordered a medium rare steak. The steak was over cooked, the fries were soggy, the salad on the side was ok. The waiter was attentive and nice. Overall, it was not a very pleasant experience with the food and the ambiance. The thing is there are so many Italian restaurants in the city with a variety of price points, food offerings and atmospheres this place really  doesn't have a chance on making it to top 30. No repeat"}
{"text":"Top notch service and AMAZING food!! They make fresh mozzarella daily. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Been here once.   Service was good, food decent.  Nothing remarkable but nothing wrong.  Just a mainstream box resto with dependable eats and service.  Would I go back?  If there wasn't much else in the area that piqued my interests."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We're vegetarian so we always have the caprese salad and the hazelnut ravioli. They use fresh mozzarella. Service is always awesome. Yum! Music is great, too. The only con is that it gets quite busy & loud."}
{"text":"The food was horrible!! Fresh mozzarella?? It didn't taste at all fresh and they had the nerve to charge $13.48 for that? Wow.. I was shocked. The buttersquash ravioli was way too sweet, and no other flavours. The bruschetta was way too hard and difficult to chew. Was not impressed with with the quality of the food. We went here based on a suggesstion from a friend. Looks like I won't be taking their suggestions for food places anymore haha. I will definitely not be going back here. 
The server had no clue about the ingredients of the dishes when questioned. I understand they can't memorize the whole menu, but working at a restuarant, a server should be briefed on the basics."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal here! Our server Luis was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave great recommendations! The mozzarella was fresh and delicious. We recommend ordering the stuffed meatball. It was juicy and full of flavor. Great ambiance and food!"}
{"text":"The food was great, environment was as well. Our server was the 3 star element. Perhaps an off day but for a party of 6, arrangements made ahead of time regarding bill as it was a birthday, and a surprise get together. Confirmation of the needs was made the call prior when they confirmed the reservation.
Server was aggressive, he would leave the table with half orders, did a quality check when the food was put on the table as opposed to during the meal. Interuppted and starting talking over table regarding the 1/2 meatball. Which for all the hype he gave the story he was going to tell of the meatball it was basically one of the best in Toronto. Appeared mad when dessert was declined.  Asked about the bills when explicitly requested to not do so, then was irritated when multiple were requested. A brutal server. Great food."}
{"text":"I've been to Scaddabush several times now and they have still been able to maintain their high rating.

The four of us had dinner here Sunday night a few weeks ago. As usual we had to wait for a table but surprisingly the wait wasn't as long as they said it would be. My boyfriend and I got our usual (large Caesar salad, spaghetti and stuffed meatball, and the butcher pizza). When we received our spaghetti the manager came out to speak to us. He told us that the pizza came out too well done so he wanted to make a better one. He then apologized that it would take another 5-10 minutes but we didn't mind. Afterwards, he said the pizza was on him. Awesome! We've never had that happen before so we were surprisingly shocked.

Scaddabush is still one of my favourite Italian restaurants to go to in the area. Hopefully your visit will be a 5 stars just like mine."}
{"text":"I've been to Scaddabush more than a few times either downtown or at this location; I've found the food to be consistent most of the time with some hit or misses depending on what you order. For an Italian chain restaurant, it's great that fresh mozzarella is made every night for you to enjoy.  However, of course this isn't the best Italian you will eat in the city.

That being said, the times I've gone the service at this location is good. When it opened last year, the service was friendly and attentive. However, I came by on a weeknight a week ago or so and the service was noticeably slower. Somehow our waitress got switched just as we sat down and throughout the night we were not able to see her. 

Food wise, the fresh mozzarella is always a winner. Whether it is the fresh naked mozzarella or the burrata, when paired with a red wine, it is a delight for your taste buds.  The crispy/crunchy bread that accompanies the cheese gives the soft richness of the mozzarella some contrasting textures. I've only had 2 pastas the many times I've been here. Out of the times I've gone to Scaddabush Scarborough, the pesto pollo fettuccine is good (sometimes the chicken is dry) and the butternut squash ravioli is always great. Usually I end up getting the butternut squash ravioli because it's probably my favourite thing to eat here.

Overall, service at this location can use a bit of work, but other than that, it's a great option other than the other chain restaurants that are around the mall. I'm sure I will return again in the future if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"first time caller...long time listener 

anyways...this restaurant came very very VERY highly recommended from a co-worker. as far as im concerned, when an Italian tells you something is good, don't question it. he really had me at when he explained to me \"they make their own mozz...\" 
i wanted to come here on a very special occasion, so i decided to go for my first anniversary with my girlfriend. 

finding this place was a bit ackward, on google maps it has it listed on the intersection of yonge and gerrard, it is infact just a bit north west of the intersection.

we did not book a reservation(my line of thinking was, its the Thursday before Easter...no ones going to show up...WRONG!) 
the wait was very minimal, 15 minutes at the most. very very intimate setting, dim lighting and very romantic setting(candle light). 
we were greeted by our server named Jeff, Extremely friendly and amazing with his professionalism/manners. asked us if it was our first time within the establishment, and all sorts of other formalities. he also explained that they make the cheese everyday as a niche of the restaurant (and he wrote the name of the guy making the cheese...the name escapes me, as well side note my back was to the cheese making so i missed the whole thing) we wanted to celebrate and get a drink to celebrate the occasion. i was very impressed with Jeff's honesty, Jeff had explained that he needed to get back to me with what brand whiskey they had, due to a vendor change they had earlier in the week. drinks were ordered and we were looking at the menus. i couldn't help but notice all of the nice accents to this restaurant, the old school light bulbs, the exposed ceiling, and the jars of sauce/peppers designed and placed so properly balanced throughout the place. jeff returned with our drinks and we ordered the food, obviously i went with the fresh mozz...being a cheese lover that i am, it would have been pretty foolish to pass it up. when the app's came, i was blown away by the sizing, it was a decent size, but by the time i came to finishing the app, i was feeling satisfied. the mozzarella is amazing and should never be passed up.(i am also aware that they only offer it during 5-11pm) no sooner our apps were done, and jeff was back with our mains. i was slightly disappointed in the sizing, being a big guy i always worry about a main being enough food, however by the time i had finished the main, i was done for the night. my significant other had an issue with her main salad, which we had brought up to jeff, when we brought it up, jeffs manager deducted that main down from full price, which was a very nice gesture, considering the main was perfect, it was the side garnish that was not. 
we contemplated dessert but were too full to partake. 
a side note to my story as well: i was approached 3 times, by three different workers (managers i assume) asking if the service was up to a good standard, and if i was ok. this is how good business is done. 
im very proud to say, jeff worked his butt off for us on this amazing evening, actually took the time to know us, and congratulated us on our very happy year, with more years to come. 
i have no problem saying i gave jeff the biggest tip i've ever given to any server. 
just perfect from start to finish. 

pros: very romantic, fresh cheese, good portions, excellent quality
cons: wait time, a bit loud, all cheese sucks if not fresh :)

this is the best sit down dinner i've ever had the privilege of eating at."}
{"text":"what does scaddabush mean to me?
some of the most amazing flavors and combinations to hit your palette
one of the best atmospheres to come and have a meal 
the absolute best in service and this is location #3 that i have been to in the GTA. without getting into details right away, all three locations have my personal best tip that i have ever given THATS HOW GOOD IT IS. this locations only knock would be the parking situation, this location has a terrible amount of parking, because it has to share with 4 other stores in the general walking area...not impressed, but cant take that out on any one of the businesses. we got seated right away to our reserved table, had met our waitress for the lunch. she came off right off the bat as very intelligent, warm, and inviting. she explained to our friends in the double date how the restaurant is, specials and specialties that Scaddabush is all about (fresh mozzarella) which the waitress flawlessly nailed the pronunciation of it. we had a bit of time with the menus, i already knew what i wanted, but i had to take this location in, very rustic a lot like the other locations as well, the music was played at a very respectable level, tv's had random sports on, and jars of sauce everywhere. we were sitting right next to a chandelier, which was pretty cool. we placed our order and were on our way, when the appetizers came to the table, we literally filled the table up, fresh mozz, bucco bites, and polenta balls. personally i would have have just stuck with the fresh mozz, but i wanted to try these two items that were calling me from the menu. i had them, and im pretty sure i wont be getting them again, they were great, but just not how i thought they would be. the mains came in and we had a bit of a problem, my s.o. didn't think the dish would be as spicy as it was, when the waitress swung by again, my s.o. explained to her the situation, and she immediately took the plate back and got the kitchen to re-do it without additional charge and without a complaint. my pasta dish was absolutely stellar, but within taking a bite i knew something was missing from my end, chili flakes, which the server brought over and was a very amazing addition to my food. my s.o.'s replacement meal came and everything was great. we really shouldn't have, but we got dessert and were pleasantly stuffed. Scaddabush has one of my highest recommendations in all of the GTA and has never failed in any form or fashion since going to the first location a couple of years ago. 

extremely happy in all aspects with this locations and all locations Ive been to, come and check it out and grab the fresh mozz!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Scaddabush, I was finally able to have lunch with a friend on Saturday here. The hostess was very friendly and as soon as I sat down, the waiter offers me water.

When my friend arrived, we ordered the bruschetta to start. It was fantastic! Very fresh tomatoes and the garlic chips added a little something extra to the dish. It was a good portion for two people to share.

My friend got the stuffed meatball on a bun with a side Caesar salad. I had a bite and thought the meatball was very well seasoned. My friend loved it and loved the Caesar as well. It was quite filling so he was only able to finish 3/4 of it 

I'm a sucker for pesto pasta, so I got the pesto pollo. It had fettuccine that I could tell was very fresh with sautéed chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, baby spinach, and a creamy basil pesto sauce. The only reason why I'm not giving this review 5 stars is because the pasta was a tad bit saltier than I would have liked it to be. My friend had some of my pasta and thought it was perfect. So I mean, guess it depends on personal preference?

The waiter was very attentive, checking up on us frequently and refilled our waters often.

Great place :)"}
{"text":"We loved the fresh naked mozzarella appetizer. Made fresh daily. We then ordered the carbanaro and pesto pasto dishes to which we were very satisfied. The homemade stuffed meatballs looked to die for and will order on my next visit. The only negative is there was a 30 min wait. But worth waiting for"}
{"text":"1st time in restaurant to celebrate my friends birthday & we didn't even make it past the front desk because the hostess commented,\"Looks like you wear the pants in this relationship, when asking what they serve aside from pasta!\" meanwhile we are not a couple and both of us immediately walked out! That is not a warm welcome!"}
{"text":"We recently came here for my husband's birthday and we have always had great experiences here. I have found their food often very fresh and the food tasty with great flavour. However, this time around, we were not as impressed. We came with a group of 8, and the service itself was great. They gave us a spacious table enough space for our toddler and baby as well. However, the food was not as good this time around. We ordered the Seafood fettucini and Chicken pesto pasta shareables. I found that the chicken was tough and the plate rather small to be a shareable between 3-4 people. The pasta was good, but portions were smaller than expected and priced at around a hefty $40 per plate! Our friends ordered pizzas as well and the presentation was great, with their special scissors and wooden board, but the pizza itself was dry and the ingredients not as fresh. The waitress was great in terms of giving us a free birthday chocolate cake with a sparkler, and even one for my son as his birthday was coming up as well, but in terms of the food itself this time around, it was lacking in freshness, portion and flavour.
I was surprised at the quality this time around as we've had really good experiences previously and really enjoyed all their pasta dishes before."}
{"text":"Attached to the Jack Astors, we visited for the first time. Great patio with lots of room...we ordered the mozzarella appetizer and the calamari...both were scrumptious! The penne pollo pasta and the butcher pizza were perfect. Lpts of fresh ingredients made the pasta and pizza light and fluffy versus greasy amd heavy...very impressive. Our server was great amd we were well taken care of. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a rainy Saturday afternoon for Lunch with my sister. As soon as we stepped inside I was in love with dim lit atmosphere and rustic decor of the restaurant, exposed brick walls, unfinished ceilings, butcher block top bar and tables. We decided to sit at the large bar. There were several flat screen tvs above the bar framed in antique picture frames.

The bartenders there were all very friendly, chatting with us and making great recommendations.

For drinks we started with the Blood Orange Bellinis - Smirnoff Orange Vodka, Cherry Heering, Cointreau, Prosecco, blood orange puree, sugar syrup, pineapple juice
First of all this was a stunning drink they nailed the vibrant blood orange colour perfectly but the taste was soo refreshing, perfect balance of sweet from the pineapple juice and sour from the orange

Even with recommendations from the bartenders all the appetizers looked to good pass up so we decided to order a bunch of them  to share and split a main course

Calamari Fritti - Dusted in seasoned flour, salsa verde aïoli
The calamari was nice and crispy but that aïoli was delish the addition of salsa verde really kicked it to another level

Osso Bucco Bites - Italian dry spice pork, pappardelle crisps, chili rosemary honey, Grana Padano
I was a little hesitant on ordering this but the bartender said it's a must and he was right!
The bites which took more than a bite were really meaty and the flavour was unlike anything I'd had before - Honey & cheese on meat? It gave it a really addictive sweet and salty flavour with a touch of heat from the chili I highly recommend! Oh and it came on a bed of deep fried fresh pasta which were also really crispy  covered in the same seasonings as the bites were a great accompaniment

Straight Up Meatball (stuffed) - Served on focaccia crostini, cheese sauce, garlic chips, fresh basil
We also couldn't resist ordering the signature meatball.Definitely get the stuffed version as it had layered slices of pepperoni and mozzarella inside, the meatball itself was very flavourful, juicy, and tender topped with a generous coating of gooey fresh mozzarella in a pool of tomato-basil sauce and the fried garlic chips were a tasty garnish

Baked Carbonara - Parmesan cream sauce, smoked bacon, scallions, garlic, black pepper, soft poached egg with fresh penne 
The bartender also sold us on this one as it's one of his favourite dishes. The pasta had ample pieces of smoked bacon and although it was baked the pasta was nice and creamy inside with a crunchy Parmesan coating exterior but the best part was breaking into that perfectly cooked soft poached egg and letting the creamy yolk mix into the pasta Delicious!

For dessert I wanted to try something new and being a panna cotta virgin I thought this was the perfect opportunity to try it out seeing as they had a chocolate flavoured one

Chocolate Panna Cotta - Lindt chocolate, yogurt, Madagascar vanilla, balsamic strawberries, fresh whipped cream served with almond biscotti
To describe the texture of the panna cotta it was like a gelatinous pudding, with a subtle chocolate flavour and slight tang from the yogurt and the balsamic strawberries has an interesting tangy sweet taste 
Although I did enjoy it I prefer more rich chocolatey type desserts so this was a lighter change for me

Finally to end our meal we decided to cap if off with some cappuccinos that came dusted with cocoa and cinnamon and a delightful fresh baked almond biscotti

Overall I have to say they have a great food and bar menu, service was excellent, the bartenders were very friendly and interactive, and topped off with a great atmosphere I definitely will return here again!"}
{"text":"On Sun 2014-05-11, four of us went there to celebrate Mother's Day. They had a special Mother's Day menu which we did not order from.

This is a medium-scale Italian restaurant.  The food and presentation were good (see my photos). The service was good.

For an appetizer, we ordered the Straight-Up Meatball to share.
We had 4 different entrees: Capri, Baked Carbonara, Chicken Avocado B.L.T., and Crusted Tilapia.
We only had one dessert: Chocolate Panna Cotta.

Again, the presentation was very good. See my pictures which include the interior and menus. The captions describe the dishes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a good meal. Bruschetta with mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes. Stuffed meatball was good. Friendly and polite service. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Had The Butcher pizza. So good. Ordered a Hoggaarden (sp?) and would haved loved a heads up that it was the size of three beer. Staff was great. Great atmosphere, neat decor."}
{"text":"Leith took great care of us Friday night. Our first time trying out Scaddabush and we had an amazing experience. Food was great, ambiance was great, service was amazing and very friendly. Everyone has to try the Fresh Mozzarella made in house. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow.

I think that several other reviews have severely underscored this place! I went in being cautious, and trying not to expect anything magnificent...so boy was I surprised when EVERYTHING was magnificent!

I decided to sit outside, as the weather was gorgeous. My waitress was Mikayla (spelling?) and she was super helpful. She recommended the white sangria as a refreshing drink for the warm air outside, and it was lovely! Served perfectly chilled and very flavorful. The table was stocked with a large bottle of water, so I was never left wanting.

I started with the Charity bread, which is a personal-sized, crisp loaf of focaccia bread. It was drizzled with garlic butter, super fresh olive oil and Parmesan cheese. I took a bite and immediately my tastebuds were rejoicing. It was crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.

The meatballs seemed to be highly praised on other reviews, so I ordered a classic \"spaghetti and meatball\" which was superb. Their meatballs are in fact, huge. This one was the size of my fist. (And I have pretty pudgy fingers) Mikayla told me that their meatballs had been voted #2 in the city, but that the #1 place had closed down. Thus by default, best meatballs in Toronto! I agree. The house made spaghetti was cooked al-dente and served with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Mmm.

I finished off with the tiramisu. I asked my waitress if the taste was overpowered with coffee, (cause I'm not wild about coffee) and she said that it was \"prominent, but not a slap in the face\" which was 100% correct. The taste and texture was outstanding. Creamy and delicious.

Overall, it was the best experience of my trip so far and I can't wait to go back to try their fresh-made mozzarella cheese!

Cheers!

EDIT:

I wanted to comment on the other reviewers complaining about the oil on the charity bread- the menu does say that it's served with lots of garlic butter. If that doesn't float your boat, then ask for a little less or oil on the side. I personally dipped my bread in more oil that came on the plate! It was super flavorful."}
