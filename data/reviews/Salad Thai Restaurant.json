{"text":"My go-to Thai spot in Oakville, my family has been coming here for years. Super authentic Thai food, the owners are gems. Favorite items on the menu: Panang curry, red curry, pad Thai & salad rolls. If you love thai food, you'll love it here!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 10yrs. This is a true community fixture & one of Oakville's best kept secrets. Their chicken pineapple fried rice & glass spring rolls never disappoint - YUM!  Don't get the wings; but then again, why would you get wings at a Thai restaurant anyways?!  Small & cozy (it's in a tiny house). Casual, community dining."}
{"text":"Salad Thai doesn't look like much from the outside and even the inside for that matter - the walls a bright shade of teal. However, the food is delicious and better than other Thai places I've had in Oakville.   I went last night with a group of 4 ppl - I had mango salad and cashew chicken - both were great.   The restaurant isn't very big so it's probably not best for a large group, however they also have takeout!"}
{"text":"I went here with my Dad recently. The service was friendly and they were willing to adjust one of their menu items to suit my dietary restrictions (I am vegan). The food was delicious! I have only been once, but I had the spicy eggplant (without fish sauce and not too spicy) and my dad had spicy noodles. We also had spring rolls. All was very good.  It's a small family-run place, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This small, family-run restaurant is one of Oakville's hidden gems.  When we lived in town, Salad Thai was one of our two or three \"go to\" spots for both dine in and take out. We still return here almost every trip back to the GTA.  Don't be fooled by the unassuming decor and exterior. While the atmosphere is pleasant and the dining room clean and well kept, nothing here is swank. This place is all about the food.  And overall, this is the best Thai food I've had in North America, an especially skillful combination of subtle, finely tuned seasonings and top-quality ingredients. Everywhere I go in Canada and the U.S., I keep trying--and failing--to find comparable Thai food. In particular, the green curry chicken and the mango salad are the best I've had anywhere.  Friendly, unpretentious service, although English proficiency can sometimes be an issue."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Extremely courteous and prompt service. The potions were very good!  Don't let exterior of the restaurant deceive you. This is a true hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The pad thai was ok but the yellow currry with chicken, potatoes, onion and peanut is incredible."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Oakville.  Food is hot, fresh and authentic. Lunch is a great deal."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that its in an old house or that it has hideous decor fool you, this place serves some seriously good Thai food.   Its run by actual Thai people unlike most places and what they serve is simple, clean and oh so tasty. The red curry beef, green curry chicken are the go to's and the spring rolls are delicious. The ingredients are fresh and the owners are really nice too.   Very reasonable prices. Never had a bad meal here. Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"It's the best, and that's just the facts.  Believe me, I've searched high and low in every city and country I've visited, and nothing compares to the Golden Peanut Curry, Spring or Shrimp Rolls at Salad Thai. Even Hong Kong's long list of authentic thai restaurants didn't quite meet the same mark.  Now, I'm particularly judging curries here, because they're what really differentiate a good thai spot from a great one. Anyone can make a decent pad thai, but curries take finesse and a little magic.  Every curry I've tried at Salad Thai boasts flavour like you've never had before. They're not too spicy, and are incredibly balanced in their spices. Unlike some spots, no two curries on their menu are the same- which is a good indicator that they know what they're doing.  I've been going to this same restaurant since we first moved to Oakville, and even when I moved to Toronto I made a point of travelling out here for my curry fix.   Don't listen to the haters. This place is THE BOMB."}
{"text":"We visited this cute little place on Friday, Jan. 12th for dinner. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and the food came in no time. We ordered the 6 deep fried shrimp rolls as an appetizer, they were crispy and hot and came with a home made sweet and slightly sour dipping sauce - delicious, rating 5/5. As mains we had Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp and the Thai spicy noodles with chicken. Pad Thai: had an authentic taste, rice noodle, egg, tofu, green onions, peanut and bean sprouts were blended together in a professional manner and the portion size was good, rating 4/5. Thai spicy noodles with chicken: had a great \"spicyness\" and kick to it. The glass noodle, chicken, green and red peppers, onions, mushrooms, carrots, fresh basil leaf in Thai spicy sauce were all fresh and the taste was well balanced. I ordered a mango juice to go with it and it counterbalanced the spikes of heat as needed, rating 4.5/5 In a nutshell, it was a great dinner and this place is super for a quick bite for dinner during the week, or as well a great place to start your weekend. We hope you enjoy it as well!"}
{"text":"Spring rolls are actually out of this world good.  I used to think the best spring rolls were from Dragon Boat Fusion in Richmond Hill (made with fresh cilantro.. so good), but the ones from Salad Thai are so so so much better.  Also, the restaurant has been at the same location for over a decade which should speak to their tastiness.  They pump out awesome green curry."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food, but not the best I've had. Flavour was ok, but relatively bland. Price was right, pretty cheap, so id return for a quick take out if in the neighbourhood. The service was friendly and frequently asked how we were doing so that was 4/5 for sure."}
{"text":"A classic diamond in the rough. Succulent well-priced curries and their lunch special is a great deal."}
{"text":"We ordered \"meet two old friends\", green curry, and mushroom soup. They tasted just ok. We have been a lot of Thai places. This one is just average. The reason we don't like it is the size of the dishes. They are too tiny. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this restaurant. It is the absolute best! The food is authentic, always made to order, fresh and the owners are absolutely wonderful.   Order the coconut rice. Seriously. I'm not joking, it is the best tasting rice you will ever have. Order the pad thai? Doesn't matter, get a side order of the rice. It's that good.   The food is nothing less than outstanding. I always get the red chicken curry with coconut rice. Words cannot express how amazing it is. I can literally eat an entire order of coconut rice to myself it's that good. The three friend's curry is also amazing as is the cashew chicken, basil chicken and pad thai. The servings are large. You can easily share with someone or take the rest home for a meal the next day.   The fresh spring rolls are good. Sadly they are made before the dinner rush, so they cannot be ordered without cilantro. I pick it out, not a huge deal. Just that good. The deep fried pork dumplings are amazing as well. I love the sauce they put out with them. The tampura is also delicious.   The restaurant is small and there's often a wait. They do a large take out business. I enjoy dining in because of the owners. They are so sweet! Shrimp chips and dipping sauce are brought to the table once you've been seated and drink orders are taken promptly. Your water glass will never be empty!  Easily the best Thai food in Oakville."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Although I wouldn't be their biggest fan with their interior decor (alas I only ever do take-out), their food quality is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for years and never checked it out until a couple weeks ago, and I'll definitely be back. It's located in a small house close to downtown Oakville, has a cozy atmosphere, along with some really good Thai food. The service was great - our server was very pleasant and easy to talk to, and helped us with anything we needed.  The food itself was very good, high quality and fairly priced. Also the portions are huge so you won't leave hungry. I tried the red curry with chicken and the pad Thai. I usually don't order pad Thai when I go to Thai restaurants because I prefer the curries, but this was some of the best that I've had in a while.  We went a couple hours before closing on a Sunday night and the place was still packed with people. Don't know how I've missed out on this place for so long!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best Thai restaurant in all of Oakville. They are truly authentic and delicious. Food is amazing. I'm Asian and I know authentic Asian food. I've eaten Thai food all over the city and this is the best. Try the drunken noodles or pad Thai... You can't go wrong here. It's a family owned restaurant. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"While Salad Thai doesn't look too special from the outside the food is high quality and the inside of the restaurant is actually quite nice. They serve free shrimp chips which were a great way to ease into the meal. I had the chicken & shrimp pad thai which tasted good and was a pretty large portion size. Their pad thai has more peanut flavored versus the ketchup flavors of other restaurants. My only wish is there was more chicken in the pad thai. The meal was reasonably priced. The service was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place was my first taste of Thai back in 2006, and I have yet to taste anything comparable-- despite sampling pretty much every reccomended Thai Restaurant in all of Oakville, Kingston and Toronto.   Ingredients are fresh, the flavours incredible; service so sweet it and food so good in a setting so quirky it'll make you blush.   You can get decent Pad Thai in a food court these days and the one here isn't anything to write home about, so don't bother-- instead, go for the Lemon Grass Beef, Thai Spicy Noodles, Spicy Eggplant, or pretty much anything else on the menu (I'm afraid I can't speak to the seafood, though, I'm not one for fish).  Take-Out is great, but Dine-In is perfection."}
{"text":"To me this restaurant has the best food but the worst service ever.  Horrible dining experience... they would do better just having no in-house dining and just have everything served as takeout"}
{"text":"Always satisfied when we eat here! Very old skool, small spot. Nothing super stands out on the menu, it's all 4 star. Papaya salad and the fried fish are personal faves. Very tasty, friendly and quick and not expensive."}
{"text":"We frequent this place since we moved a few blocks away from Kerr and we absolutely love it!  It is a very cute family owned intimate but also casual atmosphere with delicious Thai food. The staff is super nice.  I love pretty much everything on their menu; but their red curry with coconut rice is the winner. The soups are great as appetizer. The portions aren't huge which I enjoy."}
{"text":"Restaurant and take-out that satisfies all my Oakville Thai needs! Small, simple, and yummy! Nothing too fancy; just tasty! Pad Thai is great. Green Curry is great. Fresh Spring Rolls are super great. I'm capitalizing them cus they are all great. Whenever I'm feeling for some Thai this is where I go."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my friends on a double date. The restaurant looks really cute from the outside since it's just a small house, and the interior decorations are very heart warming as well. Food and prices are reasonable, I'll still surprised most Thai places don't have rice come with the curry... but I guess it's their way of business. I have been to a better Thai place in Downtown Toronto, so this place didn't really impressed me... but still a good place to eat and hang out with your friends, especially you're stuck in Oakville with a budget, and got limited places to visit."}
{"text":"Excellent value. Beef curry was great. Pad Thai could have used more ingredients."}
{"text":"Safe to say that this is the best Thai food in Oakville. I've tried quite a few Thai restaurants here and none of their curry measures up to the ones we tasted at Salad Thai.  I came here with my mom and bf and we ordered a Thai iced tea, lemongrass chicken soup, red curry, three friends curry, cashew chicken, 2 servings of coconut rice, and mango sticky rice with condensed milk.  Everything was so tasty and flavourful! The three friends curry was my favourite dish out of everything we ordered.  It was very aromatic, rich, and you could really taste the coconut milk. It comes with scallops, chicken, and shrimp.   The portion size is deceptively large. Our family expected to be able to finish everything, but we left almost everything except for the 3 friends curry untouched.   The red curry was also really flavourful and tasty with a mild spice. None of the curries were watery at all, and coated the rice like a delicious gravy.   The lemongrass chicken soup was also really tasty. It was sour and tangy, with just a bit of sweetness. They are very generous with the chicken in the soup! The chicken was tender and tasted great.  My second favourite dish was the mango sticky rice. This is one of the largest portions I've ever received for this dessert and it tasted REALLY good. Everyone had some and we all agreed that we would definitely order this again in the future. The sticky rice had the perfect consistency and sweetness while the mangoes were super ripe and sweet.   I personally also liked the Thai iced tea, but my mom thought it was too sweet haha.   Also, the coconut rice is a must!! It adds so much depth of flavour to whatever you're eating. It's like rice on steroids.  Overall, I was really impressed with this restaurant and will definitely be returning in the future. Next time, we want to try the $9.99 lunch specials!  TL;DR Best Thai curry in Oakville. Everything is very flavourful here and the food portions are quite big. Order the coconut rice for your curry and mango sticky rice for dessert!"}
{"text":"BEST THAI EVER!!! Every item we got was delicious! I had read a yelp review saying that the coconut rice was amazing, and it was! As was the panang curry, pad Thai, and oyster beef and broccoli. Will definitely be back...many times!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant with friends last week. I don't have much experience with Thai food, so it helped they had eaten there before.   I ordered the Pad Thai and it was DELICIOUS. My friends had the curries and they loved them. The only negative thing was that, though the waiter who waited on us was friendly enough, when we were done, he ushered us out quickly, like now we had given them our money, we weren't allowed anymore. It was strange. But when I want good Thai, I'll think about ordering from them. :)"}
{"text":"What counts for 4 stars in this town is really 2.5 at best.  Soup: bland, watery Chicken wings: below average Red curry chicken: below average  Overall: Lacking flair, flavor, and finesse."}
