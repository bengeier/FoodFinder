{"text":"We were looking for a burger place after spending the day in downtown Toronto. Most places were closed as it was already after 8 pm on a Sunday and we came across this place near our hotel. At the time we had no idea, but the important feature about this place is that everything is prepared kosher, so no pork bacon, dairy cheese or milk is used.  The person taking our order was very friendly and helpful with the selections.  They have traditional burger combinations as well as other originals. I ordered the lamb and beef burger with carmelized onions. My wife had the fried chicken.  The burgers had pareve \"cheese\" and the milkshakes were made with soy milk.  We were able to watch them prepare all of the food.  The meat was fresh and not frozen. The onion rings were crispy and light. And I would have never known that the delicious strawberry shake was non-dairy.  The only reason for subtracting a star was that my chicken wing was a little dry. The thigh was excellent. If possible I only would've subtracted 1/2 a star. I hope you give this family run establishment a try."}
{"text":"This place turns the expectations on their head. An underappreciated diner vibe and super customer service clearly separate this place from the others.
Don't get me wrong, it's no more or less expensive than any other fleishig restaurant around but there's a level of quality here that makes you feel as though you're getting your money's worth for a change.
Hand smashed made to order burg, handmade onion rings that are awesome compared to regular onion rings let alone the minced frozen onion product served by other places, fries that taste of potato...need I say more?
I haven't tried the chicken as yet given I don't quite live around the corner but will do in future.
Definitely hoping this joint breaks the mould of failed places that preceded it in this plaza."}
{"text":"Great place for quick meat meal. Lots of options for burgers, chicken, onion rings.

Not so impressed with the fries, and the house salad was a joke. Browning lettuce with a tiny drop of avocado. Also the only vegetarian burger was dry and overcooked so watch out if you are considering bringing vegetarian friends here. 

The place is pretty chaotic and messy, with limited seating so keep that in mind if planning a group visit here. Although we didn't have to wait too long to get a table to seat our group. 

The specialty burgers aren't as good as they sound, so you're probably better ordering a self- crafted burger. They won't add any toppings or sauces to their specialty burgers. 

The burger patties were a bit small and thin.

They only have ketchup available on the counter, no other toppings (unless you order them I guess) 

Fried chicken is pretty good. 

Also the place is a blatant rip off of Shake Shack. Seems a little sneaky to copy another business' design so obviously, not just fonts/colours/logos but also menu items."}
{"text":"Some pluses and minuses here. 

The burgers are good - make sure you ask them not to burn them. They have beef bacon - this is usually burned. 

The chicken wings - stay away. Worst wings I've ever had, to be honest. First off, they look like canary wings. Also, I've never seen more feather stems on wings before. Gross. 

Prices - what do you expect? - standard kosher issue ripoff. Charged me $7 for less than a 100g of their pulled beef as an addition to my burger. 

A double burger will cost you anywhere from $15-20, not including sides or a drink."}
