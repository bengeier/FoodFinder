{"text":"I like this buffet for the large variety. I also like the fact they have regular rice and ice cream. I come here with my family on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Always delicious food and management is great!  Wait staff rotates a lot but is usually consistent with being efficient at their jobs!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Food is good, fresh if you come during the busy times. Service is good, water glass was never empty. The only thing I didn't like is the floor seemed to be dirty. Napkins and food stuff all over, none of the staff seemed to care. Also, the steam from the buffet made the sneeze guard dripping with water. Besides that everything else was fine."}
{"text":"Came here today with my friends. As a buffet they are pretty good, they have hot and fresh food. I recommend their sweet sour soup and their Chow Mien.  They have pretty reasonable price for 10.99 you also get fresh oyster and Crab leg. Will definitely come back next time."}
{"text":"My family and I used to come to Jungle Buffet like crazy, like every other week. We didn't know Asian Buffet had moved in until last week, at which time we tried it right away. I though the service was similiar but the food was CRAP. Waaaaaay worse than before. Fewer choices, seemed like it had been sitting around for hours."}
{"text":"Food is decent enough to pass for a Chinese buffet. Service was great. We came at around 8:30 pm and was promptly seated. Food was ok. They had a pretty good variety. I liked their roast beef and the other pork. I didn't try the breaded stuff as much because of the review that I read. Tried fried squid tentacles, in general it was chewy, a bit hard to eat and dry. I'd say most of their food were dry. It might partly be because of the time we came in. Pork and shrimp dumpling was good however the shrimp dumpling had a rather gummy outer covering."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner lately with my family and friends. The hostess said we will be charged 10% for having  a large group because of the additional service (moving the chairs and tables maybe?) and stuff.  But she added  she can rip that 10% off if we were seated apart...... Duh? Where's the logic in that? Seated at the same table or apart doesn't make any difference! Anyway, we were already there, starving, so wth and we thought we'd be seated close to each other, because we went there as a group.. But to our dismay, our tables were all around the place! With tables close to each other empty!   Our family was seated at the far end where the chairs were piled up and we felt uncomfortable so we asked the hostess if we could be transferred to a different table. Guess what? The hostess was hesitant and  said they have to bring back the 10%!!! We asked for the manager  but she even didn't talk to us (i wonder if she even speaks english) and was talking in chinese! Spell rude! Anyway, we still insisted on being transferred and the hostess eventually agreed.    They were also running out of food that time that the table next to us had to tell one of the servers to pls refill it because we paid for it!   So disappointed that our fun night had to end that way! Never will we ever go back to this restaurant again! Ever!!"}
{"text":"I love food and since I travel often on business and dine at the finest restaurants I have seen my fair share of places.  This buffet is fantastic value for money and the food is perfectly fine. If you are coming here expecting to pay $10 for a $40 per plate meal you are just being silly of course.  I have been here twice with my Family, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both visits were fantastic.   On the second visit we were 7 people and nobody complained about a single dish.  We were seated immediately, drinks were on the table in under 5 minutes and every time I went back for more my plate was gone when I got back.  I tried quite a variety of dishes and they were all great tasting and perfectly warm (for all the complainers in the other reviews).   Loved the coconut shrimp, the duck was pretty good, egg rolls were good, Wonton Soup was good, the wonton in it was average. The noodle dishes were very tasty, those chicken kebabs were great.  The sushi bar does not have much variety but what they have is pretty good  As expected none of the dishes completely blew me away as the best I ever had, but that is not what I expected at the price so 5 stars it is.  My family thoroughly enjoyed both visits and constantly nag me to go back.  On our way out my 3-year old boy asked for a second fortune cookie and was promptly handed as many as he could carry (I think it was about 15) to take home !"}
{"text":"I soooo regret walking in! Just looking at the food I told my daughter let's just leave but she said let's just try it out we are already here. I tried a little bit of everything and I can honestly say I regretted every bite. Food old and cold. Stale. Reheated. Fries cold and stale. Rice reheated and hard. I knew I was going to have to pay so I tried desert thinking that would be decent. Donuts cold. Fruit had a can flavor. Hands down the only good thing was the ice cream and the refrigerator was dirty. Worst decision ever. Such a waste of money and left with a stomachache. I don't understand how people gave good review. Makes me wonder what type of food they are use to eating if they think this place is good."}
{"text":"Loved it! My girlfriend and I went around 9 ish so it was pretty quiet and ya food was great, waitress was super nice and ya I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my brother and my mom. Everything was fine UNTIL one of the busser decided that he could balance 20 plates on one arm and grabbed the empty plates on our table. That's cool and all but what I found disappointing and I got pretty choked was that one of the plates the busser had filled with leftovers fell onto my lap and sauce spilled over my right arm, good thing I was wearing a jacket but my outfit was completely ruined. My $1200 designer outfit (Hugo Boss jacket and Saint Laurent denim) was ruined! All the busser can do was apologize but saying \"sorry\" will fix my outfit, I demanded for him to pay for the damages (dry cleaning and laundry) but then I thought to myself that probably his paycheque won't even cut it so I let it go. Lesson learn, don't wear anything too expensive into Asian Buffet unless you're willing to get your outfit ruined and not being taken care of. When I complained to the floor manager who was covering the cashier all he said was \"sorry it won't happen again\" of course it won't happen again, get your bussers to take at least 4 plates instead of 20 at one time. The floor manager covered our lunch since that was the least he could do which I accepted."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my food.  They offered me $1.00 off my meal.  What a deal.  I will not darken the door of that place again."}
{"text":"No... Just No..  i must have been there when there was an off day because myself and a few others could not finish what we had. Im not into the sea food part, maybe that was good but for the western Chinese  food like ginger beef ( soggy, bland clumpy) the fried rice ( not cooked well and still had hard bits) the S&S pork ( just no) the won ton soup ( no flavor,  just water)  the dumplings ( sort of OK  when the fresh ones came out)   The grill was OK but not worth it in total , I tried and wont try again.."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and has a very distinct oder that smells like feet. The food when fresh must taste good but I would not know as everything I had tasted as if it was out all day. On top of that it is expensive... so that's nice. Lol"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting place I have ever ate at. I was just there and had to walk out in the middle of our meal after witnessing a middled aged asian man picking his nose only to continue to devour it as if it was his last meal...he ended up cleaning out his two nostrils only to watch him handling food at the buffet. I notified the woman at the front and 3 more guys listening in to me explaining to her what was happening and i turned to physically point this man out to see him with now with his chop stick in his ear. I understand that there wasn't much she could do however she didn't offer to move us and her only concern was that she couldn't take anything off the bill...I never once asked for any type of discount. I know the servers had to see this guy because he was going hardcore on his sniffer for at least 4-5 mins and they are constantly looking at the customer to refill their glasses. I will NEVER be back to this place and I think the public should be warned that the workers there obviously don't care over how dirty a customer can be and still be able to handle food...I guess I never expected to see that and was totally ...and I mean totally grossed out...to the point I had to walk away because I was urging. I wanted to shout out and let everyone know in the restaurant what was happening but I guess this kinda of behavior is ok with the staff of the \" Asian Buffet \"  Fellow customers please beware."}
{"text":"I am not what you would consider a picky eater.  I will eat  or try anything. When it comes to this place though, I think not. The tables steam but the food is ice cold. They have one or two okay dishes but I mainly want hot food. Try it if you want to but I find this place to be rather mediocre."}
{"text":"Asian Buffet, the title sums it all up perfectly.  Mediocre food, served semi-warm awaits everyone.  I do have to congratulate them on the wide variety of food, but at times like this I wonder, is the quantity worth the sacrifice of quality?  Amazing company made it the most enjoyable for me, if you're looking for a traditional Asian buffet experience you will find that here.  If you wish for quality, order a'la carte elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't see why there are so many negative reviews,the dinner is great, the prices are incredible! Don't go for lunch, they won't have as many options. The waiting time is usually under 15 mins, the longest I've been to was slightly over 30 mins, and that was around Chinese New Year. Mongolian Grill is nice, baby corn and steaks are must try, and grilled pineapple can be rather delicious. They have canadian snow crab, and that's an incredibly delicious option. You can eat as much as you want and you'll enjoy the whole meal. They have a variety of desert and an ice cream bar too. Chicken wings are nice, stir fry is good. You simply have to go there."}
{"text":"Has been very hit and miss over the years, with a few steady staples like hot and sour soup and mongoli grill always there.   Went there right before it closed last week - good God, the way they clean is DISGUSTING. We saw a woman pull up a food tray and set it aside to reach into the steam water that keeps all the food hot in order to dip her cloth to wipe down the ice cream coolers and the counter around the desserts. How often does that water get changed?? Slightly later a crew came around and started using some pretty grimy water to wipe down the insides if the buffet tops - with the open food still in baskets underneath, with their cleaning swill water dripping on the open baskets of food. Ew. I don't think anything which they 'cleaned' did anything other than spread around bacteria."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Bobos but the traffic on Hunt highway was backed up for miles so we ducked in to Asian Buffet by Walmart. Next time I will wait in traffic. Place is dingy and hot. I tried the salmon and it was dry and it just came out of the kitchen. Some items that were supposed to be crispy were soggy from the steam tables. Had to give bus boy our empty plates after he passed us a couple time.   Don't stop by."}
{"text":"We only ate here a couple of times and I was very satisified. The seafood selection was awesome. I was really disgusted at Jungle Buffet in the end.   This new Asian Buffet is great! The only thing that was odd about this buffet was the strange locals who arrived in pajamas and spoke on the cell phone while getting food on their plates.   Honestly, I have a lot of complaints about various places here in STV from the library to the rude staff at QT, slime at the Circle K fountain ice dispenser to the nasty food at Wok and Roll. Let's face it, this area is seriously lacking customer service and quality food.  Asian buffet offers customer service and quality food. This Asian buffet is awesome and I am really grateful I don't have to drive to Chandler to get some decent Asian food!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! It only gets 1 star because I had to in order to write a review.  The Wong tong \"chips\" were rancid. ( I almost threw up) the to go containers were FILTHY! I know they had to have seen that. At this point I'm not going to trust the meat so I just get an egg roll that was chewy , noodles that I ended up spitting out in my napkin, and caned fruit that turned out to be rotten.  Oh , did I mention that I had my 3 kids with me and they spit all of there food out except the rice, donut, and ice cream. The sprite was only carbonated water. How do they stay in business??? I will NEVER GO AGAIN!! And anyone reading this, I suggest you never go either. YUCK!!!! Someone from the board of health please get this place to shut down or up their game by a million percent!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to an Buffet, this is the place in Calgary. The food is fairly good and judging from the line up on Friday and Saturday nights it is a popular place. Try this place on a weekday as usually you can get seated right away. Not the healthiest eating here, but what they do, they do well. For those that see a buffet as a challenge, not fine dining. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going to Asian Buffet (formally known as Treasures of China) for years. The quality of food has always been a little bit all over the place. It's never been horrible, but some days are better than others. Their food trays are usually stacked nice and high and they have quite the excellent assortment of foods which means you will probably find something that you like. I'm particularly fond of their large dessert selection, yum sweets!   The location is pretty ok, but their building is huge so it works for them and pretty much guarantees you'll get a seat. Because they focus on being a buffet the service is also pretty good in regards to having plates cleared away without building up. Water is also topped off frequently which is perfect because I always get thirsty at these places (MSG perhaps? Or just regular dehydration? Who knows!).   It's not the greatest, but if you're hungry enough to eat three servings, and have a craving for some ok Asian food, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ive been here 3-5 times. I like it. Is it great. ..no but is it good and fair for what you pay YES. its a buffet. ..what do you really expect?  Ill go back"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the free tap water. The food is low quality and doesn't have much taste. The buffet is not set up to accommodate vegetarians and people that don't eat pork. You can't have a beef sauce dripping next beside a vegetable dish. You can't  have sausage rolls oil pouring into the beef dish.  They automatically add gratituity to the bill. It's for low class people . It's like a country club for the patrons of rexdale. Part 2. We're up to 3 stars.  It's getting a little better."}
{"text":"I was pretty nervous to try this,however  it was actually  really good! I loved the shrimp with cocktail sauce,  and all the noodles and chicken, with it being a buffet it was prertty good and the apple pie mmmm  we where way to early to try the sushi .(it wasnt prepared yet ) but will come back to try  it! and eat more, we where so full coming out! the  people that worked there where super nice!"}
{"text":"Worst food EVER! OLD, reheated, noodles like rubber bands, & DIRTY! Chicken on a stick so dry it was like jerky! Even \"honey chicken\" seemed to be so dry and as if it is a week old! Nothing edible! !!!! Wishing I wasn't required to give a star!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I don't know what people expect when they eat at places like this. You're not getting a gourmet meal cooked by Bobby Flay; it's a buffet, like the Mandarin, except I go home not feeling sick. Great cheap Canadian-ized Asian food."}
{"text":"Not recommended.  Poor services,slow clearing dirty plates. forgett about asking for some ice water they come every half hour . Rude . they stare at you constantly. Food isn't the greatest. Seems stale often ."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and prices fair.  This is one of the few Asian buffets that have real sushi.  They have multiple choices for anyone's taste and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices, decent AYCE spread with fresh foods and a good selection. Hard to find online (likely owing to the super generic name) but it's worth the hunt.   Steer clear of Sunday lunch though. There's a church nearby and it seems the entire congregation heads here after the Sunday service."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times with my husband and daughter.  We have loved the food each time.  Whenever we have been here, it has been fresh and hot.  The staff has always been friendly, and is quick to refill drinks and clear plates."}
{"text":"Asian Buffet is reminiscent of the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown along Spadina and Dundas.  Nothing fancy in decor... kitchen style tables and chairs.   If you're looking for inexpensive Chinese lunch or dinner, this may be the place for you.  It's a step down from Mandarin quality and variety, but for $13 it's nothing to turn your nose up at."}
{"text":"First let me say I'm not your average customer. I have been to hundreds of different Chinese restaurants around the world and I'm going to own one very soon.  This place is pretty decent. I think you won't beat it for the price. 11 bucks for all u can eat crab legs, fresh oysters, sushi, baked Salmon, squid and of course all your regular Chinese buffet items. We enjoy it and we're pretty picky. And u know what were not fighting to get crab legs when they come out like buffets in chandler. And I dont know the owners just thought some of the reviews were misrepresenting how this place really is. Try them, their flavors are very good! Something makes me think there are other places jealous of them around here and talking sh!!!.."}
{"text":"This place was decent for the price. Unfortunately, what used to cost us $35 to feed our family of four cost us $52 tonight. This means we will not be back. I can get much better food for that price. Bummer."}
{"text":"I've been hear dozen times since 2009 and each experience has been a little different. But today and the last few times I've been here they have been decent. It's always clean here and the staff is always nice."}
{"text":"Better value than i expected for a restaurant like this, though one did have to know what to pick, that said, its a buffet, so you can figure out what that is. I particularly liked their deep fried battered squid which was cooked well when we were there, not the rubber band material one sometimes gets. We also liked their rat-on-a-stick (read chicken skewers). As a safety check, my wife set her phone to simulate various cat noises and slunk around to determine if any response would be forthcoming, nothing happened so safe there too"}
{"text":"Worst food ever doesn't even deserve a star we tried it a couple times and will never go back."}
{"text":"Great service great price and great food. The only thing wish more TVS so I could watch the games and stay longer but it all in all was a great experiance I will be back."}
{"text":"Food was cold and old.  Waitress said they serve the same food from lunch buffet in the supper buffet.  Not worth the money or time"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here often since it's one of the only restaurants in town. However, even when we do have the option to venture further out, sometimes we still would rather go here instead! The food is great, the staff is very friendly, and the lunch prices are great. I personally feel like the dinner price is a bit too much for me. Still a great place to eat though!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating here. Besides the food being subpar, it is very dirty and worn out looking. Save your money and your gut - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"No one cares servers think nothing is wrong they dont remove platter with fly on it.  Many broken safety issues."}
{"text":"Ugh where do I start? The food is barely edible. Either over cooked or tasteless. There was a \"waiter\" cleaning the tables with a questionable substance (maybe that's why they're so sticky) The place is so incredibly dirty, like its never been cleaned in its entire existence. Good thing we came in at lunch time and only paid $15. Do not go here you will instantly regret it."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. Food is hot, very tasty and fresh & at a great price. Staff and owners are friendly and attentive. I highly recommend Asian Buffet! 5 Stars"}
{"text":"This was a really bad idea. Terrible food - overly greasy, not fresh at all, overcooked vegetables, stale jello which was actually the most appetizing thing on the dessert table.  The place was very worn and dirty looking. The restaurant is large but the table was too crowded for our group of 5.  My daughter found 3 hairs in her food. This cost us $14 each - good price but it seemed like a ripoff because the food was so bad. Never again."}
{"text":"Horrible food don't recommend it food tastes disgusting and soggy !!!  Panda buffet is probably better"}
{"text":"Food is good considering the price. I am addicted to the Sesame Balls! Staff is nice.  The steamed clams were seasoned well, sushi was fresh, the hot and sour soup was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I tried just about everything here.  I wound up wasting pretty much everything, because I couldn't stomach it.  Most of it seemed like leftovers that were just microwaved.  It was all tough or had a weird, not-fresh texture and/or flavor.  None of it was hot.  The next day, those of us who ate from the buffet were sick.  My son, a picky eater, who chose to eat cake only, was spared.  Leads me to believe we were dealing with food poisoning.  I so wish we could get our money back."}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe the negative reviews here! It's a very large buffet and has something for everyone. I've been to many of these as everyone has but their food quality is consistent and they change it often, not like others who pick out the old bits, give it a stir and dump the new \"crap\" on top. They've never been shut down due to health issues as many Calgary establishments have so if you want bang for the buck, give it a try. I can't speak for the \"battered food\" but the rest is excellent...give it a go!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Came here on a Sunday night with about 20 people in the place. Food sitting for too long and dishes and silverware on the bar were not completely clean. The only tolerable dishes were orange chicken, fried rice, crab won tons.  Seafood on the bar looked so questionable I didn't try it."}
{"text":"Service and food quality have improved drastically since I was here last. All food was hot and fresh this time and the new staff they have hired were great! I hope they continue these standards."}
{"text":"The place looks clean and has a great variety of food .  The sushi was fresh and delicious.  The chicken did not appear to be-all white meat so that put me off a little bit... also the white rice seemed a little dry .  I was not impressed with the deserts either the ice cream was way too hard and very difficult to scoop ."}
{"text":"If you are interested in a variety of greasy food in an \"ok\" setting for an \"ok\" price then this is your place. Looks pretty run down. A variety of choices, but none that looked all that fresh... felt sick when I left. Two stars because my husband loves it."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this restaurant filthy really poor customer service walked in and they didn't let their eyes off of us was extremely creepy. The employees cannot speak english they walk up behind stare down at your plate and dont say a word. Food was really bad rice was hard. Chicken was decent. Plates were dirty desserts and ice cream were disgusting. Half the price of mandarin but still wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Asian Buffet at its best. There is something for everyone here!  From Crab Legs to Orange Chicken to Mongolian BBQ to SUSI the prices are fantastic for all you can eat!  I eat here once to twice a week! A+ Service"}
{"text":"If you are into disorganized pre-meal experiences, don't miss out your chance at Asian Buffet.  The hostess station was sheer chaos.   Crazy busy on a Friday night.   We waited the 30 minutes.  If it wasn't for the great swrvice of our waitress, this would have been a solid 1 by 5, but ....  Our waitress was there to clear plates and top off non-stop Coke prontissimo.  For her efforts I would average the service out at a 3 by 5.  The buffet was a madhouse.   Food was not being replenished very quickly and at one point 3 of 4 plate stations were completely empty.   For the most part, however, the food was not bad.   I really enjoyed the crab legs,  but so did everyone else since there wasn't any left most of the time.   Overall I would rate the food a 3 by 5.  However, I am taking a solid 2 points off for cleanliness and food service standards: 1)  I actually saw the guy who was filling up the dessert dishes SNEEZE on his hand then directly place 50+ plates on the dispenser without washing his hands or using the hand sani dispenser 3 feet away. 2)  I later saw this same staff member sweeping in the mens room and NOT washing his hands when he left.   Back to plate dodo, I mean duty. 3)  Every one of the bins and racks for carrying dishes and glasses were FILTHY dirty.   I could have sworn that one of the plate bins had a label that was grey with mold (but could have just been the lighting ).  Anyhow.   You have been warned."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous here, I especially enjoyed the egg fu young and their rice is pretty darn good too.  There is a wide variety of foods,  and the service has always been wonderful.  I would recommend this establishment to anyone craving good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Omg, this place should be condemned... Dirty, cockroachs, old food, smells funny... Does the health department ever visit this place?  We walked in, sat down, took in the smells, bugs, and dirt then promptly walked out..."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They started pulling the booths out around us to clean when they were open for another hour. Even came by and took our soy sauce off the table without asking if we were done and when we asked for the soy sauce back the server just laughed at the situation because she couldn't understand us. The salmon, beef with broccoli and orange chicken were very soggy, almost like baby food. I think the only thing that was good was the soup, egg rolls and mushrooms.."}
{"text":"Food here was very good. Seemed fresh and the staff were great. It's alot better now then it was when called the Jungle Buffet. I would eat here again and hopefully soon I can."}
{"text":"Went here to eat dinner and there weren't a lot of people there. When a buffet doesn't have enough people to keep up with the food, the food goes bad and is replaced less often. This was the case here. The food was cooked decent for a buffet, but because of the lack of people, some of the food was stale. I did not trust the sushi bar enough to try it either. But the workers were nice and the place was clean and well maintained. I think it could use a few more veggie entrees."}
{"text":"Not good at all food stays out to long and gets hard and dry.  The bathrooms where filthy. The service was ok."}
{"text":"San Tan Valley is a fast-developing residential area and I'm glad that they opened this buffet there. There aren't many Asian food places in that town and those that I've tried have left me unimpressed. This buffet is a good-sized establishment, very clean (it's newly opened and occupies the space of the former Jungle Buffet), and the staff is very friendly. Not quite a super buffet, but the array of dishes is extensive.  In addition to the usual Chinese buffet standards, there's also sushi and a Mongolian grill. I tired most of the dishes and found almost all of them of very good quality, from the hot soups and cold appetizers to the variety of desserts (mousse, fresh fruit, puddings, ice cream)."}
{"text":"This place was so \"meh\". Nothing was stand-out. The best food wasn't even Chinese: it was things like fried fish (made English style), chicken skewers and mashed potatoes. Desserts were lacking in variety although ice cream was ok. Honestly the best dish here was the water (lemon slices added to the water with ice tasted very nice). It's very reasonably priced though and the staff were very nice. The ambience however was really low-class. It kind of felt like I was eating at a soup kitchen.  So overall 2/5 stars from me.  I honestly wouldn't come back. Mandarin and Wok of Fame are far better buffet spots."}
{"text":"We love this place and come a few times per month.  I love the sushi and broccoli beef.  The price is right for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here the other day. The service was good but a lot was missing in the buffet. I found that a lot of the good was just okay. There was only one dish i found was really yummy and it was a spicy one. I cant remember everything in it but it was good mixed with rice. I think they have a lot of potential but need to either hire new cooks or have them trained better. You get a lot for what you pay, not expensive."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to live just down the street from here and stopped by a few times. Last night we came back for the first time in a couple of years.  The staff were friendly and attentive, the buffet was well stocked. I didn't love the sushi (it was very dry) but I didn't expect it to be amazing. I was very disappointed to see no chicken balls since they are my favourite, and the steamed bbq pork buns were one thing that was not replenished while we were there.  Overall the restaurant is decent for the price. There is a large variety of dishes (including lots of dessert) but I feel like it's all mediocre food... Nothing was done AMAZINGLY.  I would come back but it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Went tonight as result of my first choice of Chinese being closed. Figured it was 7:50pm on a Sunday and they had over 1.5 hours til close so should still have a good selection. We walk in and it is like a steam room. The steam is pouring off of the buffet. We get seated and as we get to the buffet we see a lot of the food looks dried out a lady is actually pouring water into the baked salmon dish as it was so dry. I went with the few things that looked good and got the meat on a stick, egg roll, noodles, and egg drop soup. I bit into my egg roll and actually spit it back out due to it being room temp not warm even. The egg drop was the only thing hot. My husband got a plate full of a variety and as he starts eating he says his noodles aren't warm. He then gets to some of his other stuff and said none of it was hot and pushed his plate aside. Mind you my husband never complains about food so I knew it had to be bad. He went to complain that we just wanted to pay for our soup and go since we weren't going to eat our plates as it was cold. They actually told him the most they could do for him was give us half off of our $10.99 per person. Really!?! When we ate soup! I complained and eventually the lady said she would charge us for our soup and drinks  which I never touched as that is how short of a time I was there.  We will never be back! Save your money and eat else where!"}
{"text":"Abosoluty loves this!!!! First went to Shanghai. They were opened and opened 20 mins late with no food so we left came here. They were open early too. It amazing ! Food was amazing. So many options ! I loved it ! Lunch is 9.99 per person ! Amazing loved It. Def will come back !"}
{"text":"Your typical Asian buffet restaurant! The service is very good! The food is mediocre but I went near the end of the lunch buffet so things probably weren't that fresh! But definitely worth the price especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened. I have never gotten food poisoning and I have eaten here at least 30 times. I do however eat the same thing most of the time.  I often take my food to go which is convenient for me. The price to take food to go is reasonable.  I like to get food during dinner service on the weekend. The more people eating at a buffet, the fresher the food is. Weekend dinner service is the busiest time, so to me that makes the most sense.   I have eaten and enjoyed the following foods:  Egg rolls Spring rolls Coconut Shrimp Orange Chicken Rice Noodle Mongolian Beef Honey Chicken Crab Puffs Shrimp of all kinds (stir fry, deep fried, lemon seasoned) Teriyaki chicken on a stick Sushi (California Rolls and similar) Crab legs Octopus Chicken Wings  Things I wouldn't eat at this buffet:  Anything iced containing meat (Mussels, oyster, shrimp)  Things that wouldn't sell well and sit for long periods of time Items I don't see ANYONE else eating  Anything from that stir fry area (I have only seen two people use in years) Pizza (it's horrible) French Fries (Average fries better choices) Kung Pao Chicken (I really don't care for it here)  So hopefully this helps out somebody to get some cheap local Chinese food for a reasonable price. I think its worth a try."}
{"text":"Look, this isn't a 5-star buffet.  But it is very good.  The entrees are rotated regularly, there are crab legs at dinner ad they'll cook Mongolian BBQ at your request. Sushi is included. Price is nearly unbeatable, especially with coupon.  Atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"The food is it amazing here but what to be expected from a little buffet. Decent price for what you get here."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! What a great hidden little gem this place is! I was hungry for Asian cuisine. I just moved to San Tan Valley so I googled somewhere close to eat. Google led me here to the Asian Buffet. This restaurant is simply decorated, is clean with very friendly wait staff. I went on a Saturday late afternoon and to my delight found the restaurant only about half full. I was shown to my table quickly and my drink order was taken. I proceeded to the buffet and found so many very appealing choices to choose from. The crab legs were outstanding! They were hot, very meaty and sweet. The sushi was so fresh and delicious. The soups that I sampled were also very, very good. I almost hate to write this review as it might have people flocking to this restaurant and it will be overcrowded. However I must write about how delicious everything was. I will definitely return to enjoy more of their selections because I ate way too much of the things I liked the best. You must try this place. It is definitely a five star buffet."}
{"text":"The food options are great! The fries are amazing. However you get what you paid for, the buffet is very cheap but the options are great! Stay away from the washroom as its gross and the decor needs updating."}
{"text":"Buffets are often a hit and miss, but with Asian Buffet, it's always a miss and at best a questionable mediocre hit. There is nothing like spending around $20 sitting around picking through your plate full of poked-through food.  One visit I had I took several bites of chow mein and it tasted like plastic, I presumed the plastic covering wasn't removed when it was fried. Also a friend got sick eating Caesar salad, which in fairness was years ago (but still it's only salad!). I think the only thing I ended up eating were their almond cookies and ice cream.  Still for what can be considered far from \"fine dining\", Treasures of China-err Asian Buffet will do for a night out of eating, the sort of eating if you have underlying resentment for yourself."}
{"text":"Hard to achieve but at lunch the food was lukewarm and overcooked. Very poor quality and mediocre service.  Server has not been by once.  Will never go back. Would give it less than one star but can't."}
{"text":"Like many have said before,  this is a standard Chinese Buffet. The  food is entirely adequate. The  atmosphere is hectic. Still, this is a place where I can have sushi and my wife can have roast beef. It does the job."}
{"text":"Delicious as always but gotta say the service is wow! All of us who live out this far know that customer service is a 4letter word to most the food places around here, but not this place! This is now the third time that I just happen to look at something debating if I want it and BAM the owner is right there with awesome suggestions. She even noticed kids wanted some sweet donuts and with ten minutes to closed made some fresh ones!! This place is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, portions are more then fair for takeout and the staff are pretty polite.  My friends and I love eating here whenever we can."}
{"text":"I get that it's still Summer however, my family and I ate there this evening and the minute we walked in it was as if they did not even have the air conditioner on!! They then sat us in the corner booth by the entrance and when one of my family members complained to the manager about the matter, all he said was that the A/C was on. They never offered to change the settings or move us to a table that had a fan. Not to mention their food was very dry , their breaded shrimp was so hard that it was probably sitting there since this morning and their fries were hard and cold. The table behind also complained as well however the hostess shrugged when we let her know that and she said she just worked there.  I will not be coming here again. If you can't please your customers and you think it's okay for them to sweat in your restaurant while they pay almost 40 bucks for your food that you mostly heat up then you should close down. This business has been under new management several times...hopefully next time someone knows what the hell good customer service really means."}
{"text":"This place is seriously not good, for real. I was really super stoked to go here. I could not belieeeve that I convinced my wife to give it a shot. We've lived across the street from the place for a few years now, and I thought we'd never go. But now I wish we never had.  Cold food. Dry food. Fatty, chewy, food. For two adults and a child, it was $40 for the dinner buffet. The price wouldn't be an issue if it was worth it. But by the end of trying several options in hopes of finding just one thing to fill our bellies, we left disappointed. There are a few other things that I don't care to spend the time explaining, but why bother anyway?  I really had my fingers crossed for an, at least, average Chinese buffet. Yet it pains me to say that I won't be returning."}
{"text":"In the past, I made a review for \"Jungle Buffet\" (for those of you who aren't familiar, Jungle Buffet was the old \"Asian Buffet\") and if I remember correctly, I gave a 4 or a 5 star rating for Jungle Buffet.  Unfortunately, whether or not some people say it has or hasn't changed, I myself noticed many changes to the new \"Asian Buffet\". First off, the price is a tad more. Which is fine, if the food was good, but unfortunately all the good cooks left when JB got shut down. Our food was cold. My mom's brocolli and beef had frozen chunks of broccoli in it. My stuffed crab was luke warm, and so on and so fourth.  From the time we got there, to the time we left it was about an hour, maybe two at tops because we sat around talking... and there was stuffed mushrooms sitting out with only a few in the dish (about 6-10) Those happened to be my favorite, but when I tried one it tasted like it's been sitting out way longer than it should have, so I spit it out. My point is, if those 6 or so mushrooms were sitting out and the only thing that was keeping them warm was some warm water that ONE guy decided to pour on top of it, then I don't want to know how they keep the rest of the food warm/safe.   It sort of grossed me out of ever going there again. I don't see the point of paying more money for food I couldn't even eat because it all tasted odd or cold. Also, the sushi seemed as though it sat out for ages...No thank you. Luckily, I didn't get sick, but I'm never going back there. Which is a shame because that was my number one favorite place to go for a quick Asian food fix.   Sure, they have more of a variety of food now, but at what cost? Cold, old tasting food? Again, No thank you.    Oh, and I know this isn't too big of a concern....but they took down all the Jungle Buffet Decor. I thought that was sooooo pretty an cute. Now it has like 0 decorations up, unless they added some since the last time I've been there.  Even the fountain in the front doorway had it's Buddah man missing. Sigh. Oh well. R.I.P. Jungle Buffet. You will be missed.   P.S.  Also, for the people who bring their children there, may I suggest a little bit of advice to you. PLEASE..PLEASE, serve your child's food. Don't let them dig out green beans with their hands, lick their fingers and grab some more because you're too lazy of a parent to help your child out, and when the child looks old enough to know better, they should know better. Don't bring your child to a restaurant if you can't keep an eye on them, especially if they are horribly misbehaved and run up to random people's table and reach for their spoons/forks. ----end rant-----"}
{"text":"Went Wednesday night about 745pm- while my food tasted ok, my daughter had the crab and was sick.... Yep 12 hours later total food poisoning.   Very sad."}
{"text":"My sister, mom and I always have a good experience here, the owners and staff are wonderful and pleasant and always accommodating. I've eaten in and taken out, we love taking it to go because they weigh the food so if you don't eat a lot, you're not paying for a lot."}
{"text":"Buffets that serve quasi-Asian food, mixed with a sprinkle of deep fried Western favourites are not hard to find. Finding a quality buffet at a decent price, however, isn't always an easy task.  Apparently I found a gem when my friend brought me to Asian Buffet-- It wasn't even listed on Yelp Everyone else's loss is my gain as I see it because this place is definitely worth the money.  It is a buffet, so don't expect five star dining, but you can go in expecting some decent food. On top of the normal foods you would find at an Asian buffet (chicken balls, sweet + sour pork, fried rice etc.) they also have an entire section of the buffet dedicated to more traditional Asian fare.   The price of the buffet is $12.99, which is good for a normal buffet let alone one that offers everything Asian Buffet does. The buffet is extensive, the pop is bottomless, alcoholic drinks are a good price and they also have nonalcoholic cocktails for those looking to be adventurous but stay away from the booze.  It is a big place and finding a seat doesn't seem like it would be an issue. There is only one TV in the dining room, which is fine, but when I was there they only had bowling on which I still find slightly odd.  This place was also open on Christmas Day, so for those who aren't big on the holiday season, this is an option for you."}
{"text":"On the decline.... I used to come here on occasion when it was still called \"Treasures of China.\" It was never fantastic but it was decent and a good place to go when dining with others who all like different things.   My most recent experience here will not have me returning. The food was really pretty awful. They had peel and eat shrimp but none of the shrimp were de-veined and had thick, gritty veins (ie- digestive tracts!) running along the back of them. And believe it or not, the shrimp were pretty much the most edible thing they had. The sushi was worse than grocery store sushi -- dry and lukewarm. All the stir fried dishes were barely hot and the utensils used to serve them were sticky and unclean. Many items were mislabeled, if they had a label at all. I also tried a piece of fried white fish and it was awful. I don't even know what kind of fish it was, but it tasted funky and not good at all.   I'm generally not a picky eater and can usually find *something* at a restaurant that is palatable. But this place really did not have anything that I would consider paying for again.   Save your money and your time. You're better off Bonzai or Empress Buffet which are just a few blocks south, right on MacLeod Tr."}
{"text":"It's a buffet. There's a decent selection of food and a good variety so even the pickiest of palates will find something that will fill them up. There are items such as crab and shrimp but you know it will be from pre-frozen stuff so don't expect much in terms of freshness & flavour. They listed roast beef as a special but it was basically enormous chunks of beef sitting in gravy so my guess is that it was leftover something and then dumped into the leftover gravy and put out on the buffet table. Service was good and the waiter was very polite and when asked about the seniors discount as there was one of us over 60 and another not quite 60 corrected our bill right away and even gave us the 2nd seniors discount even though the discount only applies to those 60 & up. Asian Buffet is tucked away in the corner of the mall so cannot be seen off Macleod Trail. There is ample parking and no wait at all for a table."}
{"text":"I did not like this place. Considering the location, I'm not shocked that it sucked. They do have a lot of food to choose from, but the quality is pretty bad. I liked the lemon chicken, breaded shrimp and spring rolls. The waffles and other desserts are good. The won ton soup sucked. They didn't even add any of the vegetables in the soup that everywhere else does. My friend had the hot and sour soup and she didn't like it. The vegetables, chicken curry, noodles and rice are not quite as good as you would expect. They do have a lot of mixed drinks but none of us ordered any drinks. This places charges too much money for low quality food. I will not return here and I do not recommend that you visit."}
{"text":"I went back to this buffet back in 2015 and the food tasted pretty stale and I really did not enjoy my meal some of this food tasted either reheated or it's been out for hours! If you want to go to a buffet that serves fresh food go to the Mandarin it's worth the money for sure! Also this place is in need of a major renovation the place looks like a still stuck in the 1980s-1990s it doesn't look modern at all it looks really depressing"}
{"text":"Okay since I've been here the past few times, Asian Buffet has made some small improvements as it's a work-in-progress, and Rome wasn't built overnight. The food has improved and their selections are better. Stay tuned for updates!"}
{"text":"No kidding, the only reason we came here is because Rob Ford does. Some of the buffet items were not bad but most was reminiscent of the many subpar Chinese buffets we tend to see in the US. Food that's too slowly replaced leaving dried out and stale helpings to be picked at. Given that Mandarin is 5 minutes down the road, I think my one visit to Asian Buffet will be my only one."}
{"text":"Not the worst, but definitely not the best.  Asian Buffet has a pretty varied selection of foods available.  My husband and I have been multiple times without incident but the last visit, he decided to go outside of his comfort zone and try the Mongolian Grill.  Well needless to say, he got very ill from it.  We'll probably be back, solely because it's cheap and close.  But it's standard Chinese buffet fare.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The food was not too bad. My mom likes the joint, its pretty much your typical chinese restaurant with pretty much the same dishes. The service was ok, I was without water  for about 10 mins while I waited for the two waiters standing straight in front of me to notice till I finally called one over. I could also done without the hair in my soup bowl.. that just grossed me out.. good thing I saved the soup for last."}
{"text":"The food is so good and the service is great! Everyone was so nice and they removed plates so quickly! Everything was decorated beautifully, I'd go back everyday of the week if I could!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys. I know I had low expectations for the place to begin with, but it they hovered around those expectations.   Asian Buffet could not be any more generic. Just the name alone would leave you expecting disappointment. The restaurant is located on a long strip of \\"not much\\". Being a stand alone restaurant with nothing else surrounding it, this Chinese buffet draws people in with the price tag of $7.99 for an all you can eat Chinese buffet. The interior is dingy, but not as bad as the outside will have you believe.  The food here is rather mundane, but there were some good items to go along with the many bad items. There are 3 tables of hot food with some outside stations as well. The stations include a grill that must have been vibrant in the past but was no longer active. The soup bar is decent enough as they had a selection of 5 different soups with bread and crackers that accompany it.  Hot foods include Westernized Chinese foods like Sweet and Sour Chicken, General Tsos, Sesame Beef, Fried Rice, and Vermicelli. There are also a multitude of fried items that will leave the fat kid inside you (or outside) giddy with excitement. Fried Chicken wings, chicken balls, ribs, and noodles will make sure you die an early age.   The food isn't actually all that bad, but temper your expectations. No one should be expecting gourmet anything here."}
{"text":"OK, we have been going to this place for 4 years without a problem. Very nice buffet, very nice atmosphere, service is good. So tonight our family decided to go there for dinner. We get there, I filled my plate with 5 different sushi rolls, eat one, get ready to eat another one off my plate; I see a bed bug crawling through the middle of the sushi roll then on top of it. I got so sick to my stomach I had to run to the bathroom and vomit.  Unfortunately we will not be eating there anymore which is a shame because we loved to go there for dinner. I'm not sure if the bug fell off of someones clothes or what but the fact that I experienced that makes me wish I hadn't gone there tonight."}
{"text":"Wife and I where looking for good Chinese food that was non Hakka. Stopped in, lady at the counter was very nice informative let us know about the takeout option in addition to the traditional sit down buffet. 11.99 gets you a fairly decent amount of food with a choice of soup or dessert. Food was fresh hot and tasty. Definitely recommend this place if your looking for Canadian Chinese."}
{"text":"Went to Asian buffet cuz I was in the area. The foods are good and the price are better. 16.99 for dinner can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go and eat. Kids love the selection of American foods and desserts, adults love the seafood, Asian foods. Crab isn't very big and not too flavorful. A little overpriced for those that only eat one plateful; wishing there was a smaller portion pricing option since my young girls eat more than I do! The staff is very helpful and responsive to requests. Excellent customer service. Can most always find a coupon for Seniors or 10%off when searching online."}
{"text":"This place used to be great....but not any more. White meat in ever chicken dish has been replaced with thigh meat. All side sauces have been watered down  ( talk about saving a dollar), soup noodles are stale pretty much most of the pool take Souls like it's been sitting there for a while. Sorry to say I won't be coming back any time soon. I don't mind paying for good food but paying for stuff that just doesn't measure up? not going to do it!"}
{"text":"A decent Chinese buffet in San Tan Valley? Yes, it was actually great!  Ask for Helen, she will take care of you.  Awesome service!"}
{"text":"We thought we'd have a nice, relaxing Sunday supper. Not so. Through our entire meal a child screamed with ear-piercing pitch and management did nothing. Also, there was a child running around the tables and taking items off the tables (including ours). Parents and management did nothing about this, either. As to the food, we thought it was much too expensive for the quality. Beside the fact that we cannot possibly eat $12.00 of food, chicken dishes were tough, mushrooms slimy, desserts inedible. We think the price may be high due to the crab legs (which we did not try) and the portion of the buffet that caters to the French fry/chicken nugget crowd. So much variety must be costly. They should stick to the specialty - ASIAN - then maybe the Asian dishes would be better.  Our 'used' plates were not cleared away promptly and we never offered refills on our drinks (Pepsi and water). We stood at the register for quite some time waiting for our bill as we wanted to leave and it was not brought to our table. We will not be returning. For the price, there must be other Asian places that are quieter with better service and food."}
{"text":"We go there for the grill , bbq ribs/skewers and salmon Sashimi, sushi had many variety but sometimes do not look fresh."}
{"text":"My family enjoys the crab legs and coconut shrimp. They have a good variety of foods and desserts to choose from. The customer service is mediocre but it's a buffet so I wasn't expecting anything exceptional in that department. Overall we have only had good dining experiences here."}
{"text":"First impressions... From the bubbly, white girl behind the counter (very friendly, mind you) to the tv high up on the wall to the austere booths with seats like fresh 2x4's, Asian Buffet is reminiscent of pretty much every Asian buffet I've ever visited. Mind you, that's not a bad thing... I'm not going out to a buffet for the atmosphere or service, darn it... I'm going for food. Lots of it. Preferably hot, although warm is acceptable. And, five minutes in the door, I'll say it's living up to my expectations.  The teriyaki chicken sticks would be great if they were fresh, the flavor is good. The pork pot stickers are mediocre, with chunks of vegetable overwhelming the meat. The honey chicken is, as expected, very sweet and the Orange chicken has a nice bite to it. Not too spicy, not too mild.  The iced tea, my standard beverage of choice at a buffet because I don't need to add more calories to my meal by adding sickly, syrupy sweet soda (and in general), was not much more than slightly flavored water...as if the tea bags that were used had been used at least once before. Meh.  The peach rolls looked interesting, reminiscent of something I can't mention on here...but, strangely, had my mouth watering a bit.  All in all, it is what it is: a Chinese buffet. A place meant for us to shovel several thousand calories down our slavering gullets before rolling home to pass out on the couch from tryptophan overdose.  I didn't use the restrooms, so I can't judge. But the place was quiet and the food was still decent. I always try to give a place three tries before extolling or condemning, so be prepared for another review or two.  At this point, though... I'll give Asian Buffet four stars. It's not the best I've been to (and, dammit, I love me some Chinese food) but it's definitely not the worst!"}
{"text":"FINGER NAIL IN MY FOOD!  Now I know it's been a couple months since I've written a review but what can I say I've had a great summer and been super busy with work and enjoying life. Anyway, on to the review..  Been to Asian Buffet a bunch of times before and actually thought it was one of the better Chinese buffets you'll find in Calgary. Not anymore after my experience a couple weeks ago.   We went there on the weekend with my entire  family (about 100 of us) for my cousin's birthday party at lunch on a Saturday.   Service there was  the same as any other Chinese restaurant but at least they definitely keep the food coming. They refill often and that's nice so you can get a fresh batch of whatever during your meal, as long as you go during a typically busy time.   Food was decent. I went for my second plate, after a few pieces of sushi and dim sum, and got the Mongolian grill. Felt a funny texture in my mouth and spat the whole thing out onto my napkin only to find a FINGER NAIL. I was instantly disgusted and totally felt sick to my stomach.  I told the two managers, they were in the least understanding and even mentioned they wanted to do something for us because of our experience. I was asking them to do something for our group, But they were reluctant to offer even 5% off the bill  as they said it was too big of a party to be compensating one person's experience. So instead, I received in the mail a $30 gift card to Starbucks for the poor experience we had.   I could have easily spoiled the appetites of many that afternoon but respected the manager's wishes to not say anything. However,  as a yelp elite, I felt obligated to share my experience with others so they hopefully don't experience what I did.   I guess at least they didn't give us a gift card to go eat there again?! I am grateful they did try to do something about it though.  I understand that this may be a rare occurrence but be fore-warned.. it HAS happened here..and to me, unfortunately.   Ps - Sorry for the graphic photo but I'm not making this up!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, it wasn't great it was just basic Chinese food, no more, no lessThe crabs pulled by review from a 1 to a 3. The crabs should be their defining feature entree. Stay away from the sushi, it should be shussssNOT. I mean who uses fake crab in sushi. Mongolian beef was good, sweet and sour pork was surprisingly excellent. The good does not outweigh the sushi though. They need to rotate food for freshness more often. The stuffed mushrooms looked like they had been there from seedling to soil."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with Asian Buffet. I came here out of desperation as I had dropped off my car in the area and needed both to eat and to burn two hours. I tried to hit up bluefin AYCE for what I knew was going to be a disappointing meal, but as it turns out they are closed for renos, so off I went trekking to Asian Buffet, which involved hiking across the entirety of McLeod.   With this being an Asian buffet, the service is supposed to be crappy. Surprisingly I found the waitstaff to be relatively attentive at clearing plates and refilling water - nice.   The Buffet selection was also pretty good. I found the sushi to be surprisingly good - good ratio of fish to rice and not at all dry. It was being restocked fairly regularly and was reasonably fresh. (Great selection of sushi too!)   They also had some dim sum stuff, which was actually really good. The Shrimp Dumplings were particularly good, as they were actually filled with shrimp and didn't fall apart when you tried to pick them up. Other than that they had some pretty generic \"chinese buffet\" fare which was not too bad either. They also have a \"mongolian grill\", which I didn't try.   Overall, for $18, it was really not bad and definitely exceeded my albeit low expectations. I would definitely come here again if the mood strikes."}
{"text":"I was surprised by all the good reviews. Just don't do it..  The food was really not good. I tried a little bit of everything and the only thing that was decent was the mushrooms from the chicken and mushrooms dish- but there was no chicken.. It was weird.  Maybe we were too close to closing time (around 7:30- I didn't think it was that close), but the food did look like it had been sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"Egg roll - They were filled just to the right amount. The spices and flavoring were spot on east coast. The ingredients inside were cut down to pieces which are exactly how an egg roll should be. Kudos.  Fried rice - moist, it had a very good flavor, and a nice blend of veggies in it. Vegetable lo mein - I love lo mein, nah, I freaking dream about lo mein. It wasn't greasy, it had rich flavor, and had a good amount of veggies in it.  Rice noodles  - very wet, had a flavor to them I haven't encountered before. I didn't like the taste at all.  Crab Rangoon - It had a pleasing sweet taste, tiny pieces of crab in it and the inside was not runny and not extremely firm, just right actually. Pot sticker -  light crisp to the edges, flavorful and not dried out. Chicken Wing - A real winner on this item. They offered drumette, wingettes, and wingettes with a partial tip on them. They were all a very nice size, flawlessly cooked, juicy and meaty. I did not find any dried pockets of blood in them or any bruised meat. The coating was probably potato starch which gives a very crispy outside without being breaded. Seasoned french fries - Just the ideal amount of crisp and not soggy at all.  Egg Foo Young - Flawless on the moisture level, the eggs were not over cooked, the vegetables infused a subtle sweetness, and with the gravy it was as good.  Egg drop soup - The broth was the exact in consistency, extremely light salt barely noticeable, lots of egg, tiny amounts of peas. Hot and sour soup - freaking excellent! packed full of tiny slices of button mushrooms and slivers of wood ear mushrooms, egg, bamboo and green onion.  Chilled crawfish - OK, this my forte right here. Having lived in Louisiana for 10 years I have had crawfish boil countless ways. They actually added real boil spices to it. This alone is an accomplishment I have never witnessed outside of Louisiana at a restaurant. It was on the medium spice side and the heads had juice for sucking astounding accomplishment #2. The spices were unfortunately inconsistent from each one. This comes from not stirring the spices well into the water, and also not stirring up the crawfish during the boil.  Tip: For a little extra kick, dip the tail in the octopus salad juices, heavenly. Octopus salad, They were cut into smaller pieces and manageable for exact size bites. They were tender, and the had a decent amount of kick to the juices which were added.   Sweet and sour chicken - The bread to chicken ratio was spot on, with a light crispness. White meat, moist, and delicious.  Pepper chicken - semi moist pieces, average flavor, lots of pepper.  Baked salmon, semi moist, good flavor. I am not much of a salmon person. Crab bake - It had great roasted peppers in it. It hit your palate and has a subtle taste. Then when you chew the other ingredients interacted and turned into a heavenly blend of delight. Mongolian beef - Great flavor, perfect mix of onions, green and red peppers and green onions. Sadly over cooked.  Sweet and sour pork - Average flavor, cooked just right. Baked chicken - Manageable size pieces. The glaze was delicious and not overwhelming at all. They complimented each other well. One of the best I have had.  Broccoli beef - The beef was cut thin, it had a mild flavor and extremely tender. The broccoli in it were very tall pieces 4\"-5\" in a 3/4\"width cut on average. Kungpo chicken - It had a subtle syrupy glaze, fresh moist peanuts, good flavor to the vegetables.  Orange chicken - Big time over cooked, chewy. Good flavor if it had been made right. Clams - They had a pure taste. Creampuff - no flavor to the whipped cream inside, bland overall.  Chocolate pudding - It had that very artificial flavor to it. Not good at all.  Tapioca pudding - It had very few tapioca pearls in it and was heavy on the pudding side with a light flavor. Loquat fruit - It was in light syrup, pretty good, nothing like off the tree though.  Lychee fruit - Awesome flavor yummmm. Again, different from the tree eating. Coconut macaroon - smaller bite size, smidgen on the dry side, but still good flavor.  Watermelon - Bleh. That is hit and miss at any place. It is extremely hard to find a really good melon anywhere nowaday.  Chinese donut - Winner, winner! very tender. Most places they are very dry. It had copious amounts of sugar. One of the best I have had.  Apple pie - Flaky crust. It would have been phenomenal with more sugar and cinnamon.  I noticed on dishes which are breaded and glazed or in a sauce, they are the ones to eat sparingly. Mostly overcooked. If they fixed this, they would be hitting it out of the ballpark for east coast style Chinese.  I drink a lot of water, 6 glasses usually, and the waiter wasn't keeping up. Typically I ask for a pitcher straight away and should have. He was trying but also seemed pre-occupied on his phone at times...   I will be back here for sure. This was the lunch buffet. There were still many items I didn't get to try, especially the sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always fresh, lots of choices, LOVE the sushi, and the staff has been amazing every time!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a Chinese buffet. The crab legs make it worth it even if just for that"}
{"text":"Cheap Chinese buffet with great value for the price. Service is good, your empty plates will be removed often and your glass of water will be kept full.  A lot of the food aren't so great, but that's to be expected for a buffet this cheap within the city limits. Don't get too much of the lemon/kungpao/sweet&sour/generaltso chicken, because they're all mostly soft fried batter. The lettuce in the salad bar was not fresh, but was not obviously old. The tapioca dessert was certainly a lot thicker than I expected. Great ice cream selection. But really, everything is as expected in a cheap Chinese buffet.  They do take credit card. Plenty of parking in the back lot. WiFi password was posted on the front door."}
{"text":"Sushi is super good and the buffet has a lot to offer my new favorite Asian restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I shall sum it up for those who plan on eating here any time soon: Don't do it.  Food: Was mediocre, I mean they have a very large selection of food.. ridiculously large. Sushi was fine. Dim sum was strangely greasy. Noodles were greasy too. Rice was quite dry. Some of the other items were alright.  Atmosphere, it was in the summer I went, it was too cold. Place looked old, sort of worn out. They didn't really bother to try to keep the place relatively organised.   However, it wasn't the food or atmosphere that really turned my family and I off... It was the service. Normally, my family and I ALWAYS tip. But we did not tip. This is why:  - when we sat down at the table, from the beginning on the dinner to the end we were not greeted by a server at all. - we were not offered any water or tea, when we did ask, the server just rolled his eyes and came back with ONE glass of water, when my father clearly asked for 5 and held of 5 fingers indicating 5 glasses of water. When we asked him for another 4, he said, \"K\" and walked off but never came back.  - when we were done with the first plate of food, he cleared the plates. However our plates just began to pile up. Server didn't even bother to clear the plates anymore. - my younger siblings and I went to get dessert first (while our parents were still working on hot food). As soon as we sat down with the desserts, the server just casually walks by and TOSSES our bill onto our table and continues walking.  So yes, if I'm going to give TIP it's going to be for service. Which was not what we received.   Not really the best last impression of Calgary for me before I headed to the airport."}
{"text":"A lot of people are giving this place a very low rating and I understand why. The thing is, this place, with its very affordable price tag, isn't supposed to be fancy. It's meant to fill you up so much that you'll have to pray that you dont get a sodium-induced coma after. If you're going to eat here without any expectations of grandeur, then its pretty great for lunch (maybe even dinner but I cant recall how their dinner serving was).  Their selections arent half bad. They have a pretty satisfying selection for the price you're paying: baked salmon, fried rice, egg foo yung, ribs, skewers, soups, and they're one of the few buffets that I've been to that has siu mai and that makes me super happy lol. They also have those killer (literally lol) breakfast links that are sooo good and greasy. It's a guilty pleasure of mine, I admit it lol. It's nothing different from other buffets' lunch menus, but at the very least, you'll be getting it for a lower price.  One thing that does irk me is how old and dingy the place looks like. But then again, for $10/per person during lunch, I can overlook that and just focus on filling my stomach up."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't even feel like taking the time to write a review for this place but I have to warn others. Seriously... So my friend and her boyfriend invited us to join them for dinner since we drove out to Queen Creek to see their new house. As soon as we walked in I got uncomfortable. It just smelled off and looked like the establishment wasn't being cared for. We got some food but there was a lot of choices that looked questionable and I wouldn't trust so I felt very limited. I only chose things that looked either fully cooked Or something that I knew shouldn't be spoiled. Our friends started acting a bit odd and hinted we should really leave. My boyfriend and I were done anyhow because the food wasn't good at all. So when we get outside they tell us that while we were getting our food the family a few booths down actually started throwing up! They said the servers were rushing over to get it cleaned up quickly. I have never been to a restaurant where patrons are vomiting immediately after taking a few bites of food. How old or unsanitary can it be for your body to not even try to process what you put in your mouth but instead immediately starts rejecting it. Needless to say I would never ever ever EVER go to this place again. I can't even believe that. Omg no, stay away, stay far away."}
{"text":"Sad to see Jungle go, but Asian Buffet is very similar so I'm not upset. Except when we walked in last night, it was like going into a steam room! Very hot and muggy. The hostess said it's because it was cold outside. Being a Michigan native, I beg to differ! But maybe for Arizona born and raised, mid 60's in December is cold lol!  Anyways, the food was good but I don't expect the best from any buffet so my standards are lower. As long as the food is hot, and they have my guilty pleasure stuffed mushrooms I am a happy person. The spring rolls were good but where were the regular eggrolls? I didn't try much of the chicken entrees, the sesame chicken I did try was good though. The chow mein noodles were very tasty which I was not expecting coming from a tray. Desserts were not as good as Jungle's, probably because they didn't have the gelatin tiramisu cake that I could eat a whole plate of! But they did have cute little square cups of mousse, one regular chocolate and one mint chocolate flavor that was so weird but interesting. Like chocolate toothpaste mixed with the Andes Mints in a foam!   Our drinks were refilled often, service was more than friendly."}
{"text":"The food at this buffet is not great, no quality what so ever. I know that it's not the most expensive food and the dinner options have a good variety, but when it comes to desert options... there isn't many. The food looks dry as if it's been sitting awhile."}
{"text":"I went here today excited to eat there food ordered take out only to find two different kinds of hair in my food when I was half way through my meal. I will never go back here again. Get your shit together Asian Buffet and remember to put on a hair net."}
{"text":"Oh my! Asian Buffet (formerly known as treasures of china) used to be a place after my heart. A virtual dream for those that love to eat, but don't let the endless bounty fool you. The last time I went hear I learned my lesson for the last time. Quantity over quality does not a good meal make!  Not much to say other than A LOT of the food here (the last time I went) was borderline edible all kinds of stuff from pizza to crab legs to jello to self serve ice cream, peking duck and a whole lot more. I should mention that some of the items are pretty decent (considering the amount of dishes produced) but some are just plain nasty! I remember back in the day I kind of forced one of my buddies to come with the gang. He was hesitant to say the least but I assured him that a lot of the items were pretty decent (ginger beef, peking duck, beef with broccoli ect) So we all went and pigged out. During the meal he seemed fine and was like \"oh yeah! This place is pretty good!\" a couple of weeks later though I found out through another friend he had a stomach ache for days and was tossing and turning all night because of it. He didnt tell me because he didn't want to hurt my feelings! hahaha.He said it was the ceasar salad. I said \"what the heck is he doing getting a ceasar salad at a place called Treasures of china???\"\"  Poor guy!  My bad taste had claimed a victim!  I couldnt help but feel partially responsible.  The last time I came I also dragged my cousin, all I remember is him staring down at his plate full of partially eaten items and looking very disappointed. He barley even ate anything.I felt so bad for getting him to come. It was then I knew this was the last time I would ever come here! Another victim claimed!   So thats my story of Asian buffet. To finish my review I have to say that it was kind of a hit and miss, sometimes SOME of the food was actually prepared well but other times it was different or seemed recycled from previous nights food! what was I thinking back then??   Who knows what its like now! Maybe they are doing things better? Maybe worse?. I just know that one too many stomach aches and seeing my friends suffer told me it was time to say goodbye! Adios TC! You defeated my stomach one to many times..."}
{"text":"So my wife and I went there yesterday and had lunch we hadn't been there in a couple years since a bad visit from before I have to say they really improved the quality of the food and the the staff and everything I'm certainly going to be back so I'm going to move it from three stars to four"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The only thing I thought I was lacking was no real salad bar. I'm not sure I would eat the sushi either. I like instantly brush type of sushi so things of been sitting there for a while don't appeal to me. Service was great. They have Mongolian barbecue grill however I didn't see anyone going to it. I think it needs to stand out somehow little bit more."}
{"text":"ZERO customer service skills .. they will try to cheat you out of a few extra dollars if they can! Be careful! .. they decided they wanted to raise the price of the buffet up a couple of dollars temporarily during the \"Christmas season\" .. what a crock of sh*t! My dad used to be a regular here but he will never return because of the way they treat their loyal customers! They should not over charge him.. especially since he is a senior citizen! Too bad.. they are only hurting themselves as a business :)"}
{"text":"I have tried many Chinese Buffets and this one is by far the worst one. I ate here and within 20 minutes of eating I got sick to my stomach.  Every time I eat Chinese food if it's cooked correctly and if they use quality soy sauce I have no problem.  That being said the ice cream bar was dirty and since it's not served through a machine you have to hand scoop the ice cream yourself and use the same spoon that everyone uses.  I would not have a problem with that but the inside of the freezer was dirty and the ice cream containers as well.  I would much rather drive all the way to Phoenix to eat at China Chili instead of eating at any other buffet."}
{"text":"Just like any other. Not much to choose from. Bathroom us filthy. The sushi is dry and ugh.... I like SOME stuff. My family and rely in this place when we're hungry and broke. Lmao!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Food was cold. And disgusting. When I first walked in and overwhelming smell of fish. After sitting there for a while I felt nauseous and had to leave it was just too much. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Good for what it is. Cheap and good selection. What I had tasted good. Lunch buffet on Sunday was $10.99. Bear in mind no refills on drinks and they didn't mention this, so got charged for two diet cokes."}
{"text":"Sub par food and sub par service. Don't come here in the summer because they have a swamp cooler and it feels just like you're in a swamp."}
{"text":"Not great, not bad.  Basically, you get what you pay for.  Decent variety but fewer choices than Mandarin.  The quality is a notch below that of Mandarin but actually, not bad.  Some items like the wonton soup, and ribs were even better.  Considerably less expensive than the Mandarin.  Service was prompt.  Lots of free parking."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, I'd skip this spot if I were you. I used to like this place but that was almost 5 years ago..the food tastes old and as if it's all fried or made in the same pot it just taste the same it's so weird, my friend from highschool actually told me he seen a roach near the hot table  all rexdale really needs is a good Chinese spot to dine at, it's not that hard. Mandarin is down the street but they're prices are way too much if your on a budget. Try this place if you like.."}
{"text":"gross food, sticky floor, dirty bathrooms, chicken like jerky. For desert a COCKROACH crawled across our table! We told an employee and she laughed. We will never return."}
{"text":"I went here because it was my friend's birthday and he really likes it.  The good thing is they tell you which dishes have MSG and which ones don't.  It's a pretty standard Chinese buffet.  It's nothing special but it sure is filling.  It would've gotten 3 stars however they stiffed us when paying.  The gratuity was already included but they charged us extra anyways.  Also, when we were paying our bills they overcharged one of our guests.  Greed makes the world go round... or this Asian Buffet go round."}
{"text":"Mold on their Dessert. That's about all I needed to see. Unfortunately that was after eating the buffet. Which wasn't terrible but I can only imagine what the health inspector would find in the back.  It's a 3 star Chinese Buffett but the Mold gives it a 1.  Mold can f'n kill you!!   I brought it to the attention of the manager and in true Chinese fashion he offered me 10% off of my $7.99 bill. LOL"}
{"text":"I've been to a few buffets and this one is the worse. The staff was nice and friendly but the food wasn't that great. All the chicken was over cooked and hard, but was cold in the center. Most of the food I got was lukewarm at best. Best thing they had was the apple pie."}
{"text":"Awful. Food overcooked. Not a huge variety. Thankfully they credited us for those who didn't eat. Would Not recommend."}
{"text":"It's food. Maybe not good but it'll get in your belly. The strong points are the fresh sushi and hot crab legs. The rest looks good but... you might like some of it. I'm not spoiled but I do know great Asian cuisine; and this isn't it. Oh, and there's some fruit and ice cream."}
{"text":"Nice Buffet, we went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was not busy at all. Buffet was stocked and food was hot.  Food was okay, I'm giving it 3 stars because I prefer other chinese buffet's in the East Valley, but if you are in the mood for a quick lunch, this place isn't too bad. You can also pay for a to-go box. I don't eat seafood so I can't review that, but there was some plates of raw sushi that looked like it wasn't on ice, so really not sure if you'd want to eat the seafood options there."}
{"text":"They used smelly rotten shrimp to make the shrimp dumplings....  use water to \"patch up\" the ice-creams...  dirty cheap cheap place. I would only pay $7.5.... not worth it."}
{"text":"Oh God, the food was so tepidly not hot......and , well, so sitting there for a long time in a buffet....which defeats the point of Chinese food in the first place........quickly and freshly cooked. Not going back."}
{"text":"Service is always good here, they are friendly and attentive.  Sometimes the food is decent and fresh and sometimes it is downright nasty and old tasting. THE REASON WHY THIS IS: You need to understand something about this place.. They often have asian bus tours stop there for lunch / Dinner and if you are lucky to go there on one of those days the food will be good and fresh for the price you pay..  If there is no bus tour.. you are taking your chances.. and will most likely not get what you are expecting..   Weekends seems to be okay, I suppose because the food turns over faster ...   Maybe it is best to call ahead to see if is a Bus tour day."}
{"text":"It's remarkable because of the wide variety of asian food found here.   Not all of it was good but they did have some things that were OK.   I would recommend the dim sum here and the mongolian grill at the back.   The haw gow was decent and unlimited.   They also had an OK ice cream selection.   The rest was hit or miss.  But they do have a wide variety of food to try for an inexpensive price.  I wouldn't recommend this place for good asian food but if you want to be able to sample a variety of asian cuisine in one sitting this place is probably the place to do it in Calgary."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it was clean, quiet, excellent service, very nice, told me to take my time and have more. Served Saki for the true Asian experience. Good price and good food. Love the fish pond! Egg Foo Yung was very good. I will return again soon. Yumm, I'am hungry already!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the lunch buffet.  They offer both Chinese and Dim Sum in the buffet.     Upon first glance the selection is massive, however the quality of the food was far below any chinese food standard.    The chicken balls were all dough, the pork did NOT taste like a typical pork dish from any other chinese place, and the beef was also questionable.  The vegetables, rice, and noodles were tasty, and they had a massive selection of sweets.    I would not go back to this buffet place, as the food made me feel sick afterwards."}
{"text":"Decent price Good service Food is ok They got few dimsum served which is good They got this steamed fish...its so good. Not impressed with sushi though. You can also order stir fry and put whatever toppings you want. Large variety of meal but quality is sub par"}
{"text":"I figured I'd try a buffet somewhat near my house, and I enjoyed it. They had a variety of food! My favorite thing is always the sushi. The tuna roll was very tasty, but I didn't enjoy the others. I was a little disappointed about the Cali roll, but it wasn't bad. Everything else was delicious! I recommend the crab, sweet & sour chicken, and orange chicken. They even have fried bananas!  I would say I definitely had a lot to choose from. There is a nice spread of desserts as well.  The atmosphere is lively, and pleasant. It felt pretty cozy also. To note, I did get a little lost when I first walked inside though!  It was nice to leave and see the beautiful koi pond. Good touch! Keep it up!"}
