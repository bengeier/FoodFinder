{"text":"The sandwiches are made fast, inexpensive (under $5!!) and very tasty.  I highly recommend this place if you can make it down there."}
{"text":"This is the best-value food truck in Madison. A fat, great sandwich for $4.75. I recommend the Vietnamese meatball."}
{"text":"We were driving by and saw the food truck at the corner.  I tried the banh mi sandwich with shredded pork and chicken. The bread tasted fresh and crispy. The pork is the dry shredded pork found in other Vietnamese dishes.  I'm not a fan of the pork.  Next time I'll try the banh mi dac biet."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming here for lunch. In fact, I crave these sandwiches pretty often, like about as often as I crave sushi (I'd eat it every day if I could afford it - sushi I mean. These sammiches are quite affordable!). I work down the street too, so it's really quick and convenient. You show up, write down what you want on paper, hand it to the guys in the cart, and then wait for your sandwich to show up (with your paper on top - it helps if you make your name really big if you're like me and can't see far away..).

Everything on the sandwich is fresh and flavorful (I usually get ALL the toppings). I have a very high spice tolerance, so I never find the jalapeños too spicy. There are usually 5-6 slices on each sandwich. The bread is perfect for Banh Mi. Nice crisp crust that's soft on the inside and gets nice and soaked with the picked deliciousness and flavor from the innards :). I also like that there's a tofu option - it's flavorful too!

The only reason I'd give one less star is that they're not out there when the undergrads aren't around. Too bad there must not be enough business from everyone else. So Spring/Winter break I have to go without my Saigon Sandwich! #TheStruggleIsReal !!"}
{"text":"My favorite food cart in Madison. The sandwiches are great and the price isn't too expensive. Every single time I see the cart behind the chemistry building I always stop for a minute to see if I have enough cash to buy one."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Their sandwiches are made using French baguettes, with delicious pickled veggies and your choice of meat (and much more). The meat options are cooked asian style and are very savory. The best part is that a sandwich only costs 4.75! You can't find that kind of deal easily now. Just come up to the cart, fill out an order form and hand it to the guy inside. It's conveniently located at the corner of Charter and Johnson, across the street from the bus stop."}
{"text":"It's very good. I always have meatball sandwich and love it. Very convenient on campus and good price for lunch."}
{"text":"Saigon sandwiches is amazing! I went right as they opened so it wasn't too busy and I got my food quite quickly.  The sandwich overall was great.  Like others have said, it is very fresh, and very flavorful.  Every bite I took out of the sandwich was bursting with flavor, either from the meats or the radishes.  The best part is that the overall bread to filling ratio was very satisfying.  I never felt like there was too much bread or too much filling.  I did take away one star because I expected the baguette to be crisper.  Don't get me wrong, the bread was great, but seemed too soft to be a real baguette."}
{"text":"Really good food at a reasonable price. The owner is nice. Love the picked radish and cilantro in the sandwich. The only problem is it's not very filling so I got hungry pretty quick and had to eat something else."}
{"text":"This is literally the best food cart in Madison. No other cart comes close. (Caracas empanadas is the second best cart in Madison). Excellent ingredients and great options for sandwiches. Efficient service. Good value. I wish I could eat here every day. I SHOULD be eating here every day."}
{"text":"Super cheap food that is quick and delicious. I'm glad they have vegan options.  Make sure no fish sauce is added."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Madison this place has always intrigued my boyfriend and I. We moved here roughly three years ago from San Jose California. There is a huge Vietnamese community, so I love to eat Vietnamese food. This place makes a mean sandwich, had to go back for seconds. Very fresh ingredients and they where quick with the point of service. Definitely will be back. The bf loved the meatball sandwich. I could eat a million of the BBQ pork. Check it out for a cheap lunch"}
{"text":"I am surprised that no one has reviewed this cart yet, so I am taking the lead. 

Saigon sandwich offers very delicious and inexpensive ($4.75) Banh Mi, which is the baguette sandwich that introduced during French colonial period. While colonialism is a ugly history, the culinary cultural exchange certainly created some most interesting food in the world. Banh Mi belongs to this category. 

There are five choices of meat--veggie tofu, bbq pork, chicken, vietnamese meatball, and combo. You can also choose what fillings to be put onto your sandwich. The subway idea on a Vietnamese sandwich. The jalapenos are super spicy, be careful. I have tried bbq pork and chicken sandwich. Both taste good. 

The cart is operated by a team from Pho Nam restaurant. I am happy to see it in the corner of Charter and Johnson. A great place to grad quick lunch if you're in the south side of UW campus."}
{"text":"I've had this same sandwich (my fav- special combo with everything) 3 lunches in a row and didn't feel tired of it at all.. it is that good. Sometimes, I wonder how a sandwich that simple can taste so good! The combo special has roast pork and steamed pork roll. I also recommend including pate in the sandwich. Very friendly customer service too, and the speed they make these sandwiches is crazy fast."}
{"text":"Excellent affordable vegetarian option!  Easy and quick lunch on campus."}
{"text":"I love this food truck for many reasons. First, it's cheap as in it's around $5 for a sandwich that's almost a foot long. There are many meat options and it's topped with fresh herbs on a crisp bun. Secondly, it's strategically placed in the middle of the bustling campus for hungry college kids like me when I attended there. Although I remember many times looking for it and being disappointed that it wasn't there. This is one of the treasures that I miss about being on the UW campus."}
{"text":"When you are craving banh mi sandwiches this is the cart to go too Madisonian.  Fresh ingredients...love the pate, I wanted 3 yesterday could only get 1:-( By 1:30pm, he was sold out!  My only complaint, fyi  the lemonade was water down.  I'll be back for more sandwiches.  See you soon."}
{"text":"You see many food trucks come and go, and mostly you can't rely that they are going to show up everyday. But Saigon Sandwich is always there, which I can certainly rely to know that they will make my Vietnamese sandwich for me. 

I work around the block and find the sandwich perfect for lunch. It's cheap ($4.95), fast, and a short walk (South Union cafeteria takes longer usually). You can pick so many kind of vegetables / topping (no extra charge) to go with it, simply indicating them on the order sheet. I have tried most of them so many times now. My favorite is banhmi (grilled pork and chicken) sandwich.  The only thing that I complain about is probably the baguette is not as crispy as I hope it would be. Coming from New York, I have pretty high standards for my vietnamese sandwich crust! Otherwise I am happy and have been back so often since I have my first bite. And now they even accept apple pay, no excuse for no cash or even credit card!"}
{"text":"I had this sandwich the other day and it was just average really. The ingredients seemed fresh and the speed of service was fast. Good price.
But the bread was awful - just a Midwestern, white bread, sub-style soft roll. A bahn mi sandwich is supposed to be on a baguette. With flavor. With a bit of crunch.
I am a bit confused as the pics here on yelp show sandwiches on baguette - so maybe the day I went - they missed their bread delivery and went to Copps for horrible, boring rolls?????
Also, the carrots and daikon (radish) were shredded, and in the pics the veges are sliced thinly.

Maybe they have a new cook? Maybe I will give them another chance."}
{"text":"Good sandwich with excellent pork skin and chicken. The bread is not a baguette though, so not really %100 authentic Vietnamese banh mi"}
{"text":"A cheap quick sandwich, that isn't too bad.  Fill out the order paper, and hand it over.  Pay for it when you order or when you get your sandwich.  Zero verbal communication needed.  Which is probably the best part about the entire experience.  If I could get that experience at most of the places in Madison, I'd probably up everyone's ratings."}
{"text":"My favorite to-go lunch spot on campus. If you go before noon, you can avoid a line. All sandwiches are $4.75, and they have veggie options. Sometimes the meatball filling can be too fatty/greasy, but the special meat combo has never failed me. I always get all the toppings, but you can customize your own when you fill out the order form at the counter. The ordering system is a little chaotic; there's only ever one person working there who takes orders and makes the food, so sometimes you have to wait a while to put in your order. Sandwiches are about the size of a 6 in Subway sandwich."}
{"text":"A great place to get a sandwich, especially when I can't stray too far from work (conveniently across the street). I always get the tofu and a bunch of vegetables! The jalapeños are so spicy but soooo worth it. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Like many Americans, I'm a big fan of a well-constructed sandwich. There are some key things to a great sandwich - flavor harmony, texture variety, uniform layering, and good ingredients. Let's start with flavor harmony. Depending on the ingredients that you decide to add to your sandwich (I usually get all of them), the sandwiches have a good mixture of sweet, spicy, savory, and acidity. This is a very good thing as it makes each bite interesting, complex, and rich in flavor. Another good thing - the ingredients have a variety of textures with a combination of raw, crispy, and soft. Third, the sandwich makers at Saigon do a pretty good job of layering the ingredients. In most bites of the sandwich, I am able to find all ingredients present. The final point is where Saigon falls slightly short of expectations. While the bread and supplementary ingredients are all fresh, the meat seems to be of a lower quality. However, this does not deter too much from the sandwich. For the price and speed, you get a lot more than the $5 that you paid. Overall, this is a great spot on campus for a quick and flavor-packed meal."}
{"text":"I love Saigon Sandwich, I work a couple blocks away so try to get down there about once a week.  The sandwiches are great, the meats are very good, I recommend the combo, and the other toppings are all fresh and flavorful.  I recommend getting it with everything, as long as you can handle a little spice, there are jalapenos, but it isn't super spicy.  Service is super fast, and the prices are very good.  One sandwich is $4.75, which should be plenty for most people, similar to a 6 inch sub from subway, but a bit bigger.  If you are really hungry, get two for $9.50, it is a lot of really good food, and is bigger than a foot long at subway.  I mention Subway because there is one just down the street, and why anyone would pick subway over Saigon Sandwich is beyond me.  So check out Saigon Sandwich the next time you want something fresh, tasty, and not too filling.

My only complaint is their limited summer hours, but that is hardly a complaint."}
{"text":"This food truck has the best banh mi Madison has to offer. They are clean, fast, and have fresh ingredients. And the price is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Great, astonishingly cheap sandwich. Perfect for any student on the go or professional who works in the area. I went regularly for lunch when I was a student and then later when I worked on Regent. It's always stationed by the UW Chem building."}
{"text":"Let's be real here, the UW Campus is basically a wasteland when it comes to good ethnic food.  I know people rave about Mediterranean Cafe and Banzo, but when those places are your bastion for \"good ethnic food\" I can't help but shed tears of anguish.  

Fortunately, there is a food truck called Saigon Sandwiches that is my go-to when I really want banh mi.  If you don't know what banh mi are, they are Vietnamese sandwiches with a heavy French influence.  The nice thing about the food cart is that they have pens and little pieces of paper that help you customize what type of meat you want (or tofu) and the toppings/condiments.  It is kind of like Subway, except Saigon obviously has much better tasting food and none of that goofy feeling like you're on a conveyor belt and need to rush through everything.  

It is true that you can probably get banh mi sandwiches in the big cities for 4.50 or so, but 4.75 for one of these is still a good deal especially when you consider that a similar-sized sub at Jimmy Johns or Potbelly costs about the same.  And of course, these Vietnamese sandwiches are much better.  As far as the options go, I always get the special combo.  The meat is always tender, the pate has good flavor, and their bread is nice and soft.  Last week, I cut up the roof of my mouth eating chips, but couldn't resist getting one of these sandwiches.  As terrified as I was of the expected pain, the bread was crunchy but also soft enough so that I wasn't screaming uncle thanks to the cuts on my mouth. 

I'm usually here once or twice a week.  I tend to avoid going around noon because that's when everyone and their mother is lined up for their lunch breaks.  I would definitely recommend stopping by if you are near Union South."}
