{"text":"The most heavenly thai noodles ive had in toronto! The venue is nice and the service is friendly! A great place for a mellow intimate dinner"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. The food is great and very affordable. I don't like curry but their curry was yummy! I got the green curry and it was coconuty  and a bit spicy yet sweet at the same time.  We also ordered a dessert it was the mango sticky rice or something. I never had it before but I loved it."}
{"text":"This place gets a good all around \"OK\".  Nothing bad, but really nothing amazing about it.

The interior/decor, really quite nice and pretty.  Service was ok.

I ordered a green curry, chicken and veggies, with rice.  It was good.  Not great, and not bad.  Just good.  It seemed to have a 'sweetness' to the sauce which was ok, but it was really of note.  I hadn't expereicend that kid of sweetness before with the same dish in other restaurants.

I would certainly go back again to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for years. Our favorite item is the black bean tofu and the Tom Yum soup. The dinner portions here are larger than the lunch portions so we try to go later in the day.

The rice comes in triangles and their decor is amazing. We were here before they did the renovations and it's a big improvement."}
{"text":"Great Thai on Yonge again... 

The pad Thai options are fantastic. Tons of flavour, fresh ingredients, great service and cheap good quality wines. I was a bit reluctant but have been back several times since my first visit. Each time has been great."}
{"text":"I've tried a couple thai places in the area, and Papaya is the best.

I am addicted to their thai dumplings, and spicy peanut chicken with crispy spinach (their peanut sauce is amazing, I lick the plate. Don't judge me).

Their duck entrees are delicious, the duck is cut beautifully, with crispy skin. Portions are not skimpy, which usually happens when you order a duck entree. 

Highly recommend!! Tucked in right next to the LCBO."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food. Had the veggie pad Thai and the chicken panang curry.  Both tasted different than what I expected and am used to in Chicago, however both were tasty.

5 stars for the service. Our server was extremely friendly, quite helpful, and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  Went here because a friend dragged me in.  I do not enjoy anything fusion.  I always find they never mix the flavours of whatever they are doing very well.  With that being said, I ordered their red curry fish and tried their coconut tom yum soup.  I have never heard of adding coconut milk to tom yum soup before and it sounded just plain wrong to me.  But to my big surprise it was amazing.  My fish was equally amazing!  My only complaint was the people beside us needed to take a bath and the fish was drowning in the red curry sauce.  But other than that great food!  I will be back and not so against fusion food anymore."}
{"text":"This place is right by my work so I have been over 20 times. Fantastic service, great food. Offer convenient take-out. I'm hooked. and have never been dissapointed. Love the mango spring rolls. The place is clean and nicely laid out. Great Thai food."}
{"text":"How do you have \"Papaya\" in your restaurant name and not even serve a papaya dish?  Otherwise, food was quick and mediocre."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service, enjoyable atmosphere; what more can you ask for?

I had a Pad Thai with Beef, and it was delicious. I have been to Thailand for vacation before, and this is definitely comparable to the food there. What makes it better is that they serve their dishes in style and decorate their place for great atmosphere. Definitely worth going for a date, and will probably go again soon!"}
{"text":"Dear Papaya,

I am a bit concerned by your name because the signature spicy papaya salad is not on your menu. I am a bit perplexed! How could you not have it on your menu?? I think you should reconsider offering it. Afterall, isn't that what Thai restaurants are known for??

I will give you 3 1/2 stars for the beautiful decor and overall spectacular presentation. Your service was also very prompt and accommodating.

Khob-kun-Ka,
Dreamsrey"}
{"text":"I go to Papaya at least once per week for lunch and the food and service has always been amazing! They have a good selection of lunch specials, which are all reasonably priced. I would recommend making a reservation as they tend to get very busy during lunch. I have also ordered off their main menu and that has been amazing also. Papaya is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"3.5 for the food and an extra 0.5 for the service. Unlike many Thai restaurant I have been to, this place is clean and with good layout but cheap.  Not cheap for the price but for the value, delicious and larrrrge portion. Another surprise comes when I find the coconut sauce with mango which I miss so much after my last trip in Thailand. Although they don't use the white rice, but it is a good one. I really like my Thai dumplings. Highly recommend if you like spicy foods. My friend has the pad thai which is so large that she couldn't finish... It's a little sweet maybe they alter the receipt for local people... Anyway, as this one is close to my condo, I possibly will go back again."}
{"text":"Ok food but completely white-washed. Don't visit Papaya looking for authenticity. 

The lunch specials are good value and the servers are attentive, but nothing comes \"spicey\" and there are no chopsticks.  They take reservations for lunch hour. Its busy!"}
{"text":"This is hands down our favourite Thai restaurant. We have been going there for dinner for years and always order our favourites: mango cold rolls, hot and sour soup, spicy basil noodle (veggie and tofu), and the red curry with pineapple (veggie). The food is beyond amazing, prices are reasonable and the staff is wonderful. We drive 35mins to go here from Mississauga and we have never been disappointed. Always consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"3.5
Service a little slow... food was pretty good . Place is clean and waiter is friendly."}
{"text":"Anything that knows me, Knows that Papaya is on my top 5 fav list of places I love to eat.
The prices are reasonable, and food is delicious !!
The staff is friendly, and as personal as you will allow. 
Always met with a positive attitude.
The decor is nice and simple. 

Its no more than a 2 min walk from the subway station, and nice breezy walk in the summer to the eaton centre. 

I highly recommend it, anyone I have ever taken, has told me they have gone back with their friends."}
{"text":"Service was super slow during lunch time which was a disappointment. However the food was really good! Definitely enjoyed the lunch menu special, chicken pad thai. The soup was a bit too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"The food is presented nicely and the portions are a good size.  The decor is modern and looks clean.  A good place to take a date.

I had the Bankok Street Pad Thai and my friend had the pad thai.  Even though it has a chili beside it on the menu it was not spicy.  I find most thai restaurants tame down the spiciness for the Western palate so if you like spicy you should tell them.  We both enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"We ordered bangkok street style pad thai and eggplant (Pad Makheur). Since I've never been to Bangkok, I don't know if the dish was authentic. It tasted good but nothing special. Maybe a little too sweet. The eggplant was well cooked and slightly spicy - which I like but a little too much heat for my partner. The staff was nice enough to fulfill our request to exclude bell peppers and just provide more eggplant. The dishes looked slightly smaller than other asian restaurants, but we were full and satisfied in the end."}
{"text":"Some of their dishes are good and some of them are not as good.  
From the dishes I have tried:
- Good dishes:  Green curry.  I tried the vegetarian one and it was just ok..  Spring rolls.
- Bad dishes:  Pad thai - very eggy and fishy and mushy. Vietnemese rolls - very greasy."}
{"text":"I went to papaya this week for dinner at the request of my friend. I'm normally not a fan of fusion cuisine basically because it's really neither here nor there. I'd rather either have full Asian cuisine or full anything else. Either way we went and I thought I'd give it a chance. I ordered a pad Thai with tiger shrimp and when the food eventually arrived I was surprised to find that it tasted fairly good. For a pan Asian bistro it was flavourful, just the right amount of heat, piping hot, and the noodles were nice and chewy but not to the point where it wasn't pleasant. My friend ordered the glass noodles dish and he said it was very good. I didn't try it so nothing more to add there. 

The portion sizes look small but that's only because they serve it on a giant plate. In reality by the time I was half way through the meal I started to get full so don't be fooled by what you see.  Eat half of it and then make your judgement. 

I also ordered the Tom Yum Gong Soup which was very flavourful. What I thought was odd was the fact that the vegetables were actually uncooked. The texture of the vegetables in the soup felt literally like they just ladled the soup into the serving bowls and threw in raw vegetables. I've certainly never had raw vegetables in my Tom yum gong soup before and to be honest while tasty I wouldn't pay the $6 again for it. You could buy the soup paste at any Asian grocery store and achieve a similar result. Trust me, those who know Tom Yum gong soup won't be satisfied with this version. 

Let's talk about service. The gentlemen who served us was a middle aged Asian man. He was extremely nice and very friendly. We think he is the owner of the place. The problem is with the speed of service. Water was slow to be refilled. We had asked for two refills and he kept forgetting to fill our glasses. He even come over to ask us if we needed anything, we answered more water, and 5 minutes later still no water while we watched him bring out food and serve other tables. The food took forever to get out of the kitchen. I'm talking like 15 mins for the soup and another 15 for the entrée which is, come on,  ridiculous. 

I'm not sure if this was a regular occurrence but Papaya was totally understaffed and I overheard the table seated beside us complain to the only other server that they were waiting quite a long time on even getting their waters! Let alone their regular drink order. 
Really the speed of service was a big issue for me which is why they get 3 stars only. However, because the food is good I might give it another chance and try to eat when they are less busy and I'll update my review then. 

So to sum up, good food, slow service."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good food. 

Small portions, but just enough for me. Wine list was short but moderately priced.

If you're in the mood for a casual Thai meal in Toronto - you can't go wrong with Papaya."}
{"text":"I've had Thai food from around  the world. This has to be one of the worst I've ever had. I ordered a Thai dumpling which was trenched in peanut sauce and the meat in the dumpling was less then a teaspoon . I also ordered Pad Thai a simple dish that is hard to mess up.  This dish was so sweet. I thought I was biting into a dish full of sugar. The cook must have not taste it. The last dish I ordered was pad see ew. Again simple dish I expected the dish  to be sweet since the spice include dark sweet soy sauce. However, I also didn't want to have it as a desert. The delivery was decent 40 min wait."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal.  I must have walked by this restaurant a million times but have always written it off as an overly expensive asian fusion/ western influenced asian type restaurant - which is a type of cuisine I typically don't enjoy.

Well, that goes to show I should not be prejudice against asian fusion!
[*Edit:  I just looked at their website and I guess their style is listed as Thai Pan ... not sure what that means]

I really don't think the cuisine is authentic - but then again, I could be wrong - I am not that familiar with Thai cuisine.  But it doesn't matter because the food is delicious :)

I had the squid mango salad ($9ish).  The dish is listed as spicy but I detected no heat.  So, if you like your meals with some spice, specifically request the chef dial up the spiciness level.  [*Edit*  I just looked at their online menu and according to their menu, the squid salad is NOT listed as spicy - no wonder I detected no spice!  Sorry, I have a serious case of the mommy brain]  .... The slices of mango were firm and sweet.  The squid was a good texture.  The dressing was a little on the sweet side but still very good.  Portion sizes are a little small ... but that is okay.  Someone ordering salad probably wants a smaller portion size anyway.  

My husband had the yellow curry pad thai which was also quite yummy.  The noodles were a nice firm chewy texture.  I like yellow curries since as a vietnamese girl, I grew up eating yellow curries.  I don't know if I've even seen yellow curries at other Thai restaurants... they usually only have green or red.  [*Edit*  I am wrong about not seeing yellow curries at other thai restaurants.  According to wikipedia, yellow curries are common to Thai cuisine!!!]  

I had a taste of the eggplant dish.  The eggplant had a nice smokey flavour to it.  Very nice :)

The service was friendly.  We had a great server who happily divided our bill.

Washrooms are okay.

Decor is sleek and modern.  Casual but nice ambience.  

We will be back.  Hope you check it out too!  :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery - and I went with the Spicy Peanut Chicken. It was good - not great I was expecting more kick. It was also a little to soupy. The service was great. Right on time. I enjoyed the wanton soup the most - it is -10' tonight in Toronto right now. The mango spring roles did not live up to my expectation either. So - if you want a solid choice that you can count on to be good, and on time. If you need it delivered, I recommend Papaya."}
{"text":"While I enjoyed my first trip here, my latest meal was less enjoyable.  I knew that the food veered on the sweet side, which was less noticeable with the spiciness of my pad thai last time.

This time around, I ordered a Thai green curry, which was much too sweet. I found it very difficult to finish my meal.  I suggest ordering foods that are slightly spicy, because the dishes can be very sweet at this place."}
{"text":"Conveniently located at Yonge & Wellesley, Papaya offers fast service and satisfying thai flavours.

We first made reservations at Papaya for a co-workers baby shower.  Having a 12-guest party, the service was fast and food was hot. For $8.95, we all ordered our individual lunch combos. I had the Thai Basil. What attracts me most to this restaurant is the complimentary soup (corn-based), salad and spring roll that comes with each lunch combo.

I returned this week, again with co-workers, and ordered the Thai Green Curry - simply delicious!  There were only 2 servers, so we waited quite a bit for our bill; however, we weren't in a rush.

If you're looking for big flavours and standard thai, this place is a gem.
Looking forward to trying my third lunch combo!"}
{"text":"If you are a curry fan, you need to go to papaya! I love love love curries and found this place to have the best curries out of 100's of different Thai places I've tried in the GTA. Also, their tom yum soup= AMAZING! SO extremely flavorful! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place - we come often. 
Great value - good portions, delicious food for the price, and good menu of options.
Definitely recommend the pad see ew as well as the yellow curry. 

Service is also very friendly and fast. 
This place always seems to be a bit empty, which we really cannot understand because it truly is a great place, and prices allow multiple casual visits."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the restaurant experience itself since I ordered takeout, but the food was tasty and filling. Me and my girlfriend had ginger beef and beef with thick peanut sauce. The peanut sauce wasn't as thick as I was hoping for and it was  little bit too sweet for my taste, but overall I still like it. Portion size was good enough that two of us were full from just two dishes. I certainly would be interested in ordering again. Food was also reasonably priced since I was accustomed to much more expensive priced. Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been getting delivery here a few times, and they've always been excellent.

Last night, we ordered Basil Phad Sew (wide noodles, mild spicy, vegetarian) $8.95, Eggplant Spicy dish and Peanut Curry Beef. Comes with 2 rices (more like 2.5) all was $35 including a $3 tip and taxes. 

It was good enough portions for 2 people, with seconds and left over for lunch tomorrow. 
ITS SO TASTY!!

So far the 2nd best thai food I've had in the city (1st to Khao San/Sukho Thai). 

The lady on the phone was very friendly and patient as I went through the menu online. And she spoke English and had lots of recommendations."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I think it's the best Thai place within a 10 minute walking distance from the Yonge/Bloor subway line. 

Must haves: Pad Thai & golden curry.

I like the pad thai as it's not laced with tomato sauce and ketchup (and can we please stop doing that please? I know Thai food doesn't have ketchup!).

Also, while some people think the curry is too thick, that's how I like it as it gives it a good aromatic flavour.

Tip: if you plan coming for lunch, come b/w 11:30-11:45 or else it'll get packed and you'll have to wait 10-15 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"For someone who doesn't want to deal with the monstrosity that is Salad King, this is a perfect alternative. Modern, clean, not too busy. The dishes are about $2 more here than at SK, but the portion sizes are bigger and the presentation is much more advanced. There's also a larger selection here as well, so something for everyone. 

I had the fried mango spring rolls, basil pad Thai, and pineapple chicken. The basil pad Thai is a spin on the regular and very tasty. Mango spring rolls only contained mango (and a bit of salad dressing/mayo) and were nice -- reminded me of a new-age dim sum item. Easily my favorite was the pineapple chicken. Big juicy chunks of chicken and *fresh* pineapple that was both sweet and spicy. Delicious over a bed of rice. Service here is also excellent. 

I do agree with Mike S. below, the flavors can be slightly muted, but I am sure the dishes can be spiced up to people's preferences. I would recommend this place for anyone who simply doesn't want to deal with the busy-ness of SK."}
{"text":"Ordered green curry every time. Need some recommendation. Service is good, food (or I should say curry) is good. Pricy than some other places, but really deserve to go again."}
{"text":"Great place. Basil pad Thai was great. Coconut rice was to die for"}
{"text":"This place definitely surprised me, in a great way.  Craving Thai and feeling lazy, we ended up here one night, expecting a mediocre experience.  The place is larger and nicer than I would have expected.  At first glance you'd think it's a simple, modern and clean design.  After some inspection you'll realize that yes, the booths cushions are in need of replacing, and it would be a relatively cheap fix to get some new menus, but I overlooked all of that when we got our food.  We started with the samosa spring rolls and they were crispy with a great curry filling.  It's not really fair that the order is with 3 for 2 people though... I ordered the green curry for my main, and it was fantastic.  I asked for it spicy, and it was definitely spicy, but the right kind - not overpowering the flavour, and not spicy for the sake of being spicy.  Yum! The service was friendly, warm and prompt, and the food and wine were all the right price.  I've already been back!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai while visiting Toronto and Papaya hit the spot.

I ordered the chicken with spicy peanut sauce---yummy!

The staff were very polite and friendly.

My only gripe was they charge extra when I asked for no rice with my meal and extra veggies. 

If you are craving some good Thai with a casual atmosphere- check out Papaya"}
{"text":"Came here one day while we were just walking down Yonge from Bloor. It looked nice from the outside, so we decided why not?

The decor close up was a bit...falling apart. So that should defo be looked at.

BUT WHO CURS, the food was FANTASTIC!

We had: (Four of us, sharing family stylez)

Apps:

1. The Crispy Calamari : I've never seen Calamari cut like this, it was like rectangular pieces, not the regular rings, BUT IT WAS DELICIOUS. Perfectly cooked, not even a millisecond to late! Not rubbery at all, but soft and fleshy and delicious.

2. The Crispy Wontons: DELICIOUS AS WELL. They disappeared in about ten to fifteen seconds. 

Mains:

3. Golden Curry : it was good, pretty standard golden curry. The gravy was a tad too thick though.

4. Garlic Shrimp : This wasn't what we expected, but it was SO GOOD. Lots of Shrampz, Lots of Veg, and a clear broth/gravy thing at the bottom that we lapped up like dogs. TOTES WORTH IT.

5. Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai w/ Chicken & Shrimp : YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES. GET THIS.


The service was great, fast and attentive (thought it was close to closing and we were the only table there..but it was a monday night). They didnt even tell us that we stayed an hour past closing. THANK YOU.


The best part :

THE FOOD WAS SO CHEAP ITS RIDICULOUS.

4 people, and we had all of the above and it came to 12 dollars each plus tip????

12 dollars each???

TWELVE DOLLARS EACH!!!


just come here already."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. It's my top 5 in the GTA. It all tastes really fresh and simple. The dishes are elegant without being over the top.  The food is consistent every time I want a good meal. I love their soups. It's spicy and savoury. My mouth waters just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Hmms! Very nice smaller Thai restaurant with people coming in every 5-10 minutes on a Sunday night. Comfortable seating and good ambience. The chicken & shrimp pad thai had exceptional chewiness to the noodles; though I did find it a bit too salty... After all I eavesdropped a  little and heard the girls behind us claim that they drank four glasses of water.. ^^"}
{"text":"Very average experience overall. This was definitely not authentic Thai cuisine (no thai iced tea was the first tip off) but pretty good food: 

 - Thai dumplings for appetizer, excellent 
 - Spicy noodles, so-so. More Chinese style with decent taste 
 - Basil fried rice, pretty good, nothing special 
 - Mango sticky rice for dessert, terrible! It was like going to an asian supermarket for one of those pre-packaged black sweet rice deals and throwing it on a plate with some slices of unripe mango...I'm pretty sure this is exactly what happened.

I think this place is worth coming to for a diverse menu as long as you aren't looking for strictly authentic Thai dishes, but you are better off skipping dessert."}
{"text":"This place needs a make over. The interior is very dated and needs a fresh coat of paint and tlc/new decorations. Their mango salad was good as was their coconut soup. Service was bad though I think our server was new or just spacey but she got our order wrong twice and was slow and kind of unprofessional i.e. I asked her the difference between soups and she said \"I dunno.... do you know?\" and  then kind of spaced off until I asked her to ask the kitchen. Oh and their menus are very very outdated.... please Papaya invest in a makeover!"}
{"text":"Try the Bangkok street style pad thai. It has to be one of our favourite dishes here, and never disappoints"}
{"text":"This is good value, basic Thai food, mildly authentic, served at cheap prices.

The FOOD:  The spring rolls are super tasty and super addictive.  Just trust your instincts: if they feel hot when you pick them up, they will burn your tongue when you eat them ;)  The basil pad thai is a nice twist on things.  Their curries are good, but not terribly authentic.  These flavors are being cooked by Chinese people for white folk, so don't expect the full Thai experience.

The SERVICE: Rather inconsistent.  It seems to alternate between one waiter who's really on top of things and another waiter that just stares into space instead of noticing that your water has been empty for 15 minutes.  Be prepared to flag staff down when you want something...don't be shy.  

This is basic Thai food served at basic prices.  If you're in the Village or near Yonge-Wellesley, there's really nothing better...in fact some of the alternatives here are pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"The food here was flavorful, but definitely not authentic. I'm very picky about Thai food so it's tough to give Papaya a good review. I thought the food was pricey considering the quality. I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"I order take out from this place whenever I need my Thai fix ( which is at least twice a month).

The Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai was love at first sight- it always makes its way into my order. It is a little on the greasy side, but I have yet to find a pad thai that wasn't. Green curry is another aromatic delight that is decently done here. Peanut butter dumplings- awesome.

I like!"}
{"text":"Simple, clean, modern decor.  Extremely friendly servers who at least pretended to enjoy the pretty terrible jokes we were telling.  It's a total hole-in-the-wall, but the menu was extensive, as was the beer selection.  My party and I shared a few orders of shrimp spring rolls, and I ended up ordering red curry with chicken.  It was a little different from red curries I've had elsewhere (more of a cross between yellow and red), but was delicious nonetheless.  If you're in the area, it's an enjoyable, affordable, and reliable dinner option."}
{"text":"It is quite well established, very busy on a monday night. The decor felt very nice and in general a very comfortable, clean space. 

The menu is quite extensive, offering appetizers (spring rolls, wontons), curry dishes, fried rice, pad thai, dessert, and wine. 

I went for the street style pad thai with chicken and shrimp. In general there was too much sauce with the noodles and it was very sweet and soggy. The chicken was quite tender but the shrimp wasn't as fresh as I would liked.  The portion as very generous though, more than enough for one person. The total with tip came around $12.

There was only two serving people on a busy night which got a little bit chaotic as a group of 6 came in. One of the waitress was pregnant too, which was a very eye-opening experience for me."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pad thai I have ever had the misfortune to taste. The dish was overly oily and sweet. I know that pad thai is an oily sweet/sour/salty dish BUT this is just overboard."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I've tried lots of Thai restaurants in the city. I believe this restaurant has the very best green curry chicken I've ever had, anywhere.They also have a phenomenal Thai dumpling and cold roll. Their pad thai is also nice but i prefer the pad thai of their competitor, Sukhothai (on Parliament or on Wellington). But the green curry here is way better than Sukhothai.

The waiters, who have been working here for years, are so sweet and friendly and knowledgable. Nice decor too."}
{"text":"This is a go to place for a quick, delicious meal. It's never too busy and the service is prompt and friendly. My favourite meal is the papaya lamb curry with its slightly sweet, velvety curry sauce. The Bangkok style noodles are also good."}
{"text":"I usually dislike pad thai at most restaurants because I can't stand the overwhelming sour taste after a few bites. However, I've found that all of the pad Thai dishes here are yummy and do not have that overpowering sour taste :).

I really enjoy their curry pad thai and their spicy basil pad thai (both of which have pretty big portions), I also regularly order their fried calamari. The calamari is delicious and crispy and the sauce that comes with it is really good too.

Reason it's a 4 star is because I recall ordering a soup once, and it wasn't that great :x"}
{"text":"Great choices available from menu. Enjoyed my pad thai a lot. Service is warm and friendly. It didn't take long to get my food either. I would certainly go back there.
Only possible downside if anything is that the portion is slightly on the lesser side. But it's still good enough to fill you. 
The vibe of the restaurant is also very nice, for you to sit and have a good conversation with a whomever you are with.
Great place!"}
{"text":"cute small place in the area -
great service, 
quite place, can get a lil pricy
but the food comes out impeccable --
you know when you can taste how clean a kitchen is by how the food comes out and how it looks when it reaches the table.

recommended --
the mango chilean sea bass 
mango/avocado rolls
ginger tea 

hilarious factor: been there twice and both times i swear they had the same greatest hits 90's love songs cd playing on loop.
boys II men, all 4 one included in your atmosphere if that's the kind of place you're looking for ;)"}
{"text":"The first time I entered the doors of Papaya to pick up my phoned in take out order, I had not known what to expect. It was getting late and we were hungry. I had found the take out menu at the bottom of my mailbox and had decided to give it a shot. It was around the end of the dinner hour and the long, minimalist dining room was filled with chatty diners and the pungent aromas of rich spicy sauces.

Opening up the boxes at home, me and my friend were pleasantly surprised to find very large portions. My street style pad thai was perfectly balanced and topped with large, juicy tiger shrimp. The chicken curry on rice was reported to be delicious as well.  

Recently, I went back to eat in and found the service extremely friendly. We arrived very early this time to an empty restaurant and our food arrived in the blink of an eye. My curry duck and my dinner date's mango chicken were both excellent. Seats around us began to fill up during our meal and the scrumptious looking dishes being served at surrounding tables became mental notes to come back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I don't think I have lofty expectations when I say a weekday lunch downtown should not take over an hour.

Checked out Papaya around 12:30pm on a Friday and had to wait about 10 min. for an available table, not unusual.  Perused the lunch menu and we went with Combo #2 street style pad thai and Combo #8 basil chicken ($8.95 each).  Both combos included a soup, salad, and a spring roll.

Then came the wait...the soup came about 20 min. after ordering.  It was some sort of hot & sour concoction and it came out very lukewarm.  I passed.  

About 40 min. after we ordered, our food finally came and it was just okay, not really worth the wait but at least it was hot.  The 'salad' was nothing more than a small pile of greens with a bit of dressing.  The spring roll was a good size but stuffed with bamboo shoots and I'm not a fan bamboo.  I could never dine with pandas.

There were a few large groups that had been waiting for their meals for a significant amount of time as well.  We witnessed several people getting their food to go as they had been waiting so long and had to get back to the office.  I've been told that 11:30am is a better time to come because it's before the lunch rush and service is faster.  

Thai food that takes over an hour?  I think it would have been faster me to track down a Thai ladyboy and ask him/her to make me street style pad thai."}
{"text":"The service and decor are good but the food did not wow me. Honestly it tasted more like chinese food than thai. The food is certainly not bad, but I was craving Thai and instead the seemed more like asian fusion."}
{"text":"I love this place and it is my go to for Thai food. Reasonably priced, friendly service, and some absolutely fantastic dishes including the mango lamb.  YUM!!!

We frequently used them to order in also.

I've even throw in a few parties there including a birthday party and they were incredibly accommodating."}
{"text":"WOW ... Finally amazing Pad Thai ... For its been way to long!! Highly recommend the Smoked Duck Salad, Sweet Basil Chicken Pad Thai with a side of the Coconut Rice (which would be amazing just as a dessert)! Service was excellent and much appreciation on suggestions of other great places to eat."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've found in the neighbourhood. Favourites are the Tom Yum soup and the spicy basil pad Thai. The service is very friendly... There was one time we felt the service wasn't attentive but all other times it's been fast and courteous."}
