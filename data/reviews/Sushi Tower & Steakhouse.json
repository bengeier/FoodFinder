{"text":"Some of THE best sushi in this part of vegas. Very comfortable festive atmosphere. Always a hip young crowd hanging at this place."}
{"text":"my favorite sushi place in town they treat you like family and the fish is always fresh and great quality."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot! Everyone here is so amazingly sweet! This is my families favorite spot! The recommendations are on point! Co Co special is my fave!"}
{"text":"Great place. Chefs very nice and work extremely fast. Will make whatever you like. You don't have to order directly off the menu."}
{"text":"I simply love this place.   I love walking in and being greeted by everyone.  I love that we go so often, everyone fist bumps us and calls us by name, even my two little boys, who rarely come with us.   We especially love Young, James and Ken, the 3 sushi chefs.  I'm shocked to see all of the bad service comments, but then, we always sit at the bar.  Service is, without exception, always outstanding.  We typically order sushi - with our faves being tuna, yellow-tail and salmon. I love how the chefs always tell us which one is the freshest - or if they've got a batch in that isn't so good - which happens from time to time.   Our favorite rolls are the \"special\" rolls that Young and James make for us that aren't on the menu. On the menu - the best rolls - in our opinion - are the Monica, the Jay Roll, and the Mexican. We love it spicey! And the monkey roll? SO YUMMY!  The calamari is really good, too, and my youngest son loves their chicken teriyaki.  After 8pm, their hot sake is half price. That's super fun. They have a good selection of Asian Beers, too.   The prices are reasonable. On average - we pay $15 per roll. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"I give them a good rating for the sushi. It's good and creative. However the last time we were there service was lousy. After our meal our plates were taken away but we waited 20 more minutes to get the check or any other attention. No drink refills or even a glance our direction. Another waitress ended up getting our check and another 10 minutes later we finally got to leave upset and reconsidering ever returning."}
{"text":"I really like coming here for the sushi.  Quiet, friendly and the prices are great for the sushi combinations.  An incredible value for what you get so we come often.  I also being people from out of town as often as I can.  It is hidden away so it is hard to see, which is a shame for the restaurant but great for us because there is rarely a crowd.  I encourage people to come visit.  $25/$40/$60 for 5 specialty rolls is a bargain."}
{"text":"This place is great my boyfriend and I love it we drive from across town to go for dinner it's amazing food and I don't even eat seafood which is great!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! A gf of mine suggested to come here and so glad I did. I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants in Vegas and this one is by far the best yet. The coco special is the best roll and the service is amazing. Must try!"}
{"text":"This is surprisingly really good.  The employees were all very nice and attentive.  My family and I ate at the teppan yaki table.  The food was tasty starting with the salad and miso soup.  The chef was experienced and entertained us.  The only thing I wished they did was add chicken to the fried rice.  It would have been more flavorful.  Otherwise, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's my favorite sushi place In las Vegas!!  Jojo is awesome n the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I heard raving reviews about Sushi Tower from my friends so I decided to check it out for myself and let me tell you, I was not disappointed.   Immediately as I walked in, I was greeted from every corner of the restaurant and the waitress quickly seated us to our booth. There were so many rolls to choose from I didn't know where to start. I asked for a recommendation and the waitress told me I should try the Ultimate Shrimp. It was fantastic! I am a shrimp lover so this was the perfect dish for me. It was a combination of shrimp tempura, ebi, and they also add spicy soft shell crab. The spicy mayo is to die for! I used the spicy mayo as my dipping sauce for everything.   Overall, I had a pleasant experience. The waitresses were very helpful and friendly and were also fast and efficient. I cannot wait to go back and try some more amazing rolls!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. I was one of two tables that had customers at them.  My first red flag should have been the 5 or 6 menus they give you. Way too many pages to look through, duplicate items on different menus making it hard to find what I wanted. Only good thing was they had pictures of their sushi rolls.  I had to ask for nigiri because I couldn't find it amongst the 100s of line items they had.  Ordered the garlic tuna nigiri, dragon roll, and the waitress recommended \"just for the halibut \" special roll.  Tuna came out covered in some type of herb and scallions??!  I think the point of sushi is simplicity, and they dumped all this crap on tuna. -1 Dragon roll came out next, it was good, was starting to enjoy myself, until I had to pick a pin bone out of my mouth!  I have never had a bone in my sushi fish ever. Lazy, and unacceptable.  The halibut roll came out last, and I maybe got through three pieces of it. Whatever they were cooking in the kitchen just wafted this horrid fish smell through the restaurant and it grosses me out I couldn't finish the nasty roll. Whatever sauce it was swimming it was disgusting.  The place looked clean enough, but there was like this film on everything that just felt nasty.   The rolls came out very slowly for there only be two customers. The waitresses were very pushy, and even gave me an envelope with like concert tickets in it at the end. I didn't know if she was pitching them or what. Very uncomfortable.  I will not be going back, for amazing sushi, service and atmosphere in spring valley, go to haidoko on fort Apache."}
{"text":"Sushi tower was absolutely awesome will definitely return and refer friends. We had the Chicago with the screaming orgasm shrimp tempura, tiger shrimp Grand Canyon and Boston yum! Did not even need the soy sauce and wasabi! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Sushi was ok.. midi soup was ok but when I ordered chicken teriyaki it was very hard. Tasted as if it was partially frozen... first and last time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place had the best sushi and sake I ever tasted!  Customer service was also superb :-)"}
{"text":"My family and I  walked in this  sushi bar at 10:05 they close at 10:30 I've never in my life been so rushed so rudely treated because they wanted to Close so the waitress literally started rushing us out to hurry up an order we sat for a literally 20 seconds and she was rushing us to hurry up and order all our food so She and her kitchen staff can leave by 1030  I feel she was rushing us because the kitchen staff was putting a lot of pressure on her to hurry  up and get us out of there they  should put last call on their door by 9:30 so people know that by 1030 they're leaving and they can at least sit and have time to enjoy their food without feeling like a complete burden for eating at their restaurant sushi  came out extremely sloppy and not very fresh  I was very disappointed and quality of fish I'm gonna stick to the places that I like like sushi Loca where customer service is exceptional and fish is always fresh and delicious My family and I will never come back to this establishment"}
{"text":"I've never taken the time to write a review about anything but I had to about Sushi Tower.  My fianc√©e and I just moved from NY and have dined at some very known upscale sushi restaurants but this was hands down the BEST sushi we have ever had!!! We ordered the Monica, Dr. Pepper and Lady Gaga roll. It was fresh and bursting with the perfect combination of flavor!!! The service was great, very kind and friendly. We also ordered 2 appetizers and the fried cheesecake for dessert. Another plus is that it was all more than affordable.  We will absolutely be back for more !!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first one-star review.  Went there on a Friday evening. Took 23 mins to get our first rolls and then they forgot to bring out the rest of the meal. We just sat there waiting.  We assumed the waitress forgot to put in the order and just asked for the check. Then they tried to charge us for the $20+ in food we never got !  Both waitresses apologized and corrected the check. They said the chefs were really drunk. As I left I saw one of the chefs try to pin the waitress against the wall - she slipped around him and ran to the back as he chased her.  The food we did get was very fresh, but prepared very sloppy.  Very unprofessional and I left hungry."}
{"text":"I have lunch here at least 1 time per week and the food and service are always excellent. I really should give them more yelp love!   I used to get their lunch box special, which I awesome, but the last few months I've been really into their daily special rolls. Today's special, Ultimate Shrimp was so delicious I had to yelp about it.   Bottom line is Sushi Tower is awesome! Come check them out."}
{"text":"Ok the food was acceptable. But considering the price, not worth it. Most of the special rolls are over 15 per a roll. A bit too expensive since the place is very old. I would give 7.5 for the food itself. Service, 5 out of 10. Interior, 3, too old and uncomfi. Considering the price of the food, it should be nicer. And a guy in the sushi bar was cutting some cucumbers without wearing a hat nor a uniform. The server was too busy talking to a lady who seems to be the boss. Over all, 4.5. Rather go to Naked or Koma or Sen of Japan, which are just a few minutes away."}
{"text":"The decor is very nice and well treated, service couldn't be better. The noodles are amazing, cooked with egg, udon, mushrooms, and vegetables. It's a must to get. The shrimp was also very very good"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a couple of years.    Love the Sashimi, Nigiri, Spicy Sashimi, Yellowtail Martini, Gangnam Roll (without mayo or eel sauce), Spicy Garlic Edamame, and Cucumber Salad.  Not really into the rest of the rolls as I have an aversion to mayo, cream cheese, avocado or cooked items in my sushi.  But I've got a number of friends that are nearly addicted to the Monica roll.  The service can be a bit hit and miss; they don't have dedicated servers to tables everyone tries to help everyone but this means that your needs are not always communicated and then are forgotten about.    Will be coming back here repeatedly. :)"}
{"text":"JEFF#2 is a dang good roll. I was asking questions about the sauces so the waitress gave me three bowls of their main sauces: yumyum, screaming orgasm and spicy mayo. Screaming O seems to be a combinatino of the first two. It was my favorite, and all three were good. The sashimi wasn't bad either -- mini TVs at each table."}
{"text":"I eat here every Friday for lunch. I am very picky about my sushi and it's hard to find a consistently good place but Sushi Tower does not disappoint!! My go to rolls are the lollipop and Monica roll. The orgasm sauce is freaking unbelievable.. I wanna take some home and use it as a dipping sauce for all my meals!! I always sit at the bar and the service is always fast and friendly. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Back in the olden days (2008), this place was Sushi Avenue.  It's essentially the same but with more tower.  They have a teppenyaki grill.  They have sushi.  They have other Japanese fare.  It's pretty much like any other sushi shop.  However, their sushi chefs are dirty little boys.  Not dirty as in \"Southern Health District\" dirty, but as in.....they know how to build a giant sushi penis.  For the \"Tommy Lee\" roll, I give them four stars.  It includes a \"shaft\" and \"balls\" made from spicy soft shell crab and tuna.  Very lifelike.  The seaweed salad \"pube hair\" was also a nice touch.  Bravo, gentlemen.  I blushed like an LDS, sixteen-year-old girl eating this roll.  So, apparently, good for bachelorette parties!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was okay, too. Only reason we went there was for reasonable lunch special. They give a lot of food. If you are looking for quantify not qualify, it is good place. I believe it is Korean owned restaurant. Taste more Korean than japanese.  That may be why i didn't feel right. My expectation was higher."}
{"text":"Extensive sushi menu and extremely friendly and attentive wait staff. The screaming orgasm is to die for, and they have so many different rolls it takes time to figure out what to order. Everything was very fresh and yummy.  We've been back several times now and they greet us like old friends. Only drawback is we live in the northwest and they're not close enough for us to go all the time."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for lunch. The food is great. The service is exceptional - she always remembers us - and not just us - I've seen her treat  everyone like they're special. Such a pleasant experience. And you have to try the daily special. Always fun and a great bargain!!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Sushi Tower last night.   My regular sushi spot is Oyshi, but it was our friends night to pick, and Sushi Tower did not disapoint. I would rank Sushi Tower an Oyshi as equals.   Some key highlights were the Jay Roll, and I'm not sure what it was called, but some white fish Sashimi that came on a very chilled plate and had super thin jalapeno slices on it. YUM! Typically we just sit down at the and say FEED US to the chef so who knows what other rolls we had but everything was wonderful! I really wanted to try the Monkey roll, but the others at our table couldn't fathom eating fried bananas WITH sushi, so I'll have to check that out when it's just my husband and I since we are up for trying new things.  We will hit this place up again if we are in the area and I would highly recomend it to someone looking for a great sushi place in the Southwes/South Summerlin area, but didn't mind that they don't have AYCE."}
{"text":"By far the best and friendliest sushi bar in town. The food if off the charts. Fish is super fresh and all of the rolls delicious. Atmosphere is always good and the pricing very reasonable."}
{"text":"The dishes are made to perfection, they come out looking so elegant and are a treat to the eye. But they are also very delicious. Every roll is made as delicious as the other and I would recommend this place to anyone that likes sushi or wants to try it."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this place the first few times I went... buuuuut... this place just didn't phase me when I went again a few days ago. I still really like the juicy juicy roll (favorite) which is basically just salmon with avocado and crab inside (no rice), but didn't feel like anything else was that special. I ordered the uni: it had a very oceany taste, and just didn't taste that fresh. I also ordered the Monica roll (screaming orgasm + spicy mayo sauce; shrimp tempura, spicy soft shell crab with soy paper wrap, tuna and avocado on top with eel sauce) and the Tommy lee roll (soft shell crab wrapped with fresh tuna and seaweed salad; no rice). Neither of these rolls were that amazing and I feel like it is just the mix of flavors that appeals to most people.. But after trying many sushi places, I've began to appreciate the true flavor of fish, which is probably why I was slightly disappointed when I came here recently."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok second order  was half the size . Very disappointing . Waitress slammed down food . Will never go again"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.. Dishes and combinations are outstanding.Always so fresh, great specials, wonderful service."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a week night, and all the staff members were very welcoming, and friendly! We had the special Blue Fin tuna and Toro nigiri for appetizer, in addition to the Gangnam style roll, all of which were delicious! My hubby ordered the tasty dinner bento box w/ shrimp tempura and teriyaki beef; however, the fried salmon that came with the bento box tasted strange to me (it had a sour taste to it). If it wasn't for the strange-tasting \"salmon ball,\" then I would have given Sushi Towers 5-stars."}
{"text":"Hitachi Filet Mignon, Boston roll, Dragon roll. Filet not as good as Filet at Sen of Japan. Caterpillar roll, 90% Roll, exotic bomba,  double yellowtail, ultimate shrimp, Monica roll, tempura cheesecake for dessert. Sea bass teppan yaki."}
{"text":"Wanna try a new sushi restaurant... Tired of going to the same one, ordering the same thing?  I was stuck going to the usual places & scared to be disappointed going somewhere new.  I'm gonna save you the trouble of searching cause I can't get enough  of this place.  Is it your birthday?  If so, w/ your id you get 20% off & they sing you Happy Birthday while someone plays the tambourine!  Totally impressed w/ their uniqueness & special attention to detail.  Today was the Coco Special which was a fresh, sweet blend of tastes, on the inside cucumber, cream cheese, coconut shrimp wrap & crab, avocado, salmon, spicy eel mayo sauce.  You really make a lot of sounds eating this one lol!    I like the 50% off idea cause if you're like me, you get the same rolls all the time.  Honestly, if Kim didn't let me know that she had & offered these specials, I'd still get the same ol rolls.  Thanks #sushitower"}
{"text":"My sister and I (as well as our friends) are huge fans of Sushi Tower!  Very reasonable prices, decent portion sizes, and it's AMAZING.  I used to order the spicy yellowtail every time; but they still have plenty of options now that I've gone vegan.  The staff is really friendly too.  Clean restaurant, quick service, and a good location!  I'd definitely recommend it. :-)"}
{"text":"Okay I had to write an update. It was bugging me I had only 4 stars on this nugget. I love this place.  Tommy Lee - Get past the obvious issues of eating a giant penis, and it rocks. The flavor is amazing.  Lady Gaga - Very good, its better with no mayo but very tasty. Tell them to get u a super spicy dipping sauce and see what happens.  Shrimp Tornado - Wow, this is amazing. With the spicy sauce it just gets better.  Kobe Beef Roll - Amazing, this was really an amazing discovery I just made after hitting this place like 6 times.I am still discovering amazing things on the menu.  Now if you like spicy and I do you have to tell them to make it hot. I have yet eat anything here that I would consider really spicy but the flavors are amazing. Oh yeah.. ask for fresh wasabi and check out the flavor!  Service is amazing and the waitresses are all excellent. I have to say this is my spot now! So stop by and say hi when you see me at the bar!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best sushi places I have ever been!! Very fresh!  Great service! Sex on the beach is my favorite role!"}
{"text":"We just went to sushi tower tonight and loved it. I've now been three times and each time has been very good. My 3 kids enjoy it also, from the rolls to the teriyaki car bento boxes. Nice atmosphere and great service with friendly servers.   The sushi is very fresh and prepared beautifully. There is a huge assortment! We will definitely continue coming!"}
{"text":"Came here years ago when it was Sushi Avenue. Many of the same rolls exist, but the service is not what is once was.  In addition, we were charged for a roll that we ordered but never received. Upon my wife stating that we never received the roll we were charged regardless.  We were told that we had already received. Truthfully we never did!!!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The waitress was very helpful, the atmosphere was good, and the food was great, lots of options and reasonable priced.  I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday and it was completely empty which made me nervous to say the least. They brought out the sashimi and I was instantly won over!   Had their ghangam style roll which was incredible! All of the flavors in it were interesting with a combination of mind blowing spice and the perfect hint of sweetness."}
{"text":"Sushi Tower has the best sushi in town. I have tried many places and time and time again, it is always my favorite! I highly recommend Dr. Cash roll."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch date w my family! The service was great and the food was delish! The drinks and side dishes came right away. We ordered the scallop w mushroom dish to start (i forgot the name but it's served warm with rice) The GG roll was very filling. We shared the chicken katsu and salmon too!  Everything was yummy and we were happy with the service."}
{"text":"A very good sushi spot on the west side of town. I live around here and have three sushi places I rotate eating at. This is one of them.  Sometimes I want sushi, but don't have something specific in mind. The Sushi chefs make me something delicious everytime. I let them know I dont have your average american palate and they go to work. I always know I will have a good time. I go and watch sports alone, take my family and friends.  My expericene with the chefs, wait staff and food is always very good and consistent."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places! Always so kind and friendly! Great menu and sushi taste fresh and delicious. Not to bad on your wallet either!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food - service, not so good. They forget or send out wrong food, even though we've been numerous times. Time to cut the ties"}
{"text":"Erei shai ma she!  So if it was a toss up for dinner, whether Mexican or sushi, here's your answer.  Go to Sushi Tower and order the Gangnam Syle Sushi Roll.  It has spicy tuna, jalapenos, more spicy tuna, and topped with tuna and salmon.  It is then sliced and drizzled with a spicy mayo, then served with a spicy dipping sauce sort of like a Mexican roasted tomato salsa but it is made with the sweet chili sauce.  It was a great mixture of spice taste.  The fish was so fresh.  I was there around 6:30 pm and it was rather quiet, maybe the bigger crowd comes later?  There's no sushi happy hour, I asked!  It was a nice experience and I look forward to coming back.  The sushi chef at the sushi bar taught me the welcome greeting how they greet each customer who walks in the door and even wrote it out for me.    So when you hear them shout out at you \"Erei shai ma she!\"  That means welcome!"}
{"text":"This is our 1st time here and it will be the last, Food is just okay, they wont make you a 12 pcs sashimi platter if you are sitting at sushi bar, so they move us to the table. And the Service is horrible !! My gf order hot sake but came 30 mins later. We will not coming back."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious sushi combinations and sauces.  Everything was fresh and tasty. The service was stellar as well. For some reason we didn't expect to be blown away, but we were. So glad we chose to dine here. Next time we won't eat the food so fast that we don't get photos of our rolls."}
{"text":"Was there once with another couple who ranted and raved about the place. They even knew the owner so I was suspicious but game to try a new sushi place. Thanks Galena and Sebastiaan!!  I got hooked on sushi back in 1981 so I know what I like. This place was amazing. We had about 9 separate chef's choice order. One was the screaming orgasm. It was literally 10 stars out of 10 if I could go that high. It was fusion sushi with a flare and it was worth every morsel. We literally soaked up the sauce with the last bit of rice. And that was the first dish and each dish after were just as good.   Will definitely go back more often, except it is about 30 miles from where we live.  Update: November 2009.  Went back again with relatives and again the restaurant did not disappoint. Still one of the best places for sushi. This time I did not even look at the menu and just asked for chef special."}
{"text":"First time here & from the moment we walked in we were greeted so welcoming by the women. That was lovely. Looking at the menu they were of great help also and so I stayed. The lunch special was outstanding. Great amount and little extras I usually don't see at other sushi lunch spots. Now to top it off my little one had the kids meal and received it in a toy car shaped plate, she's a girl and still we both were just so surprised by it. I have not seen one restaurant ever do that it was awesome! Service Food Experience: excellent! I believe she was the owner but before we left I ran into her and I was able to share our experience. We will be back again! :)"}
{"text":"This was an impromptu lunch date with dad and we were both pleasantly surprised by their lunch special. Miso soup, salad, 2 gyozas, fried salmon, rice, 4pc California roll, and two entrees from a list... All for $8.95. That's a lot of food  so we decided to get one and share, along with a candy roll (California topped with avocado, eel and eel sauce) and today's special snapper, crackle and pop (sashimi style red snapper).   All in lol the food was good and good for the price. I took away a star due to the green tea (had a grassy taste) and the Kalbi entree in the bento box could've been better."}
{"text":"Wish we could have tried but we were turned away at 10:20 when their hours clearly state \"10:30\" and both signs flashing said OPEN.  Very disappointing. We went straight across the street to OhJah where they warmly greeted us and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped to check out this place.  Ordered a dinner special and some sushi rolls.  Staff and service was very friendly and welcoming.  Will come back again with kids!"}
{"text":"Went here for the free sake offer and a serious sushi craving and was highly disappointed. Checked in and showed the server the sake offer and never got it. Who I was with asked for a drink and never got it either. Didn't even eat the sashimi because it tasted weird. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Worst Experience EVER! We went in and the first server didnt even know the menu!  When we asked for a veterinarian dish she replies the \"Chicken Salad\"!! What the HELLLL!? The second server came and she was much better.... Until the bill came... 6 veggie rolls, 2 steaks, and 3 drinks. According to the menu that would add up to 85$ we were billed  $242!!!! 18$ for each veggie roll!!! We call the management right away! shitty service and apparently no adding skills"}
{"text":"Went here almost a year ago and the tuna martini is to die for delicious. But on a Friday night it was very noisy so that you could not have a conversation and no other sushi stood out as really great.  We thought it was expensive."}
{"text":"Had lunch today here and it was overall really good . The lady that helped us was very sweet and very patient . She also recommended many options that were all delicious! She was very nice enough to bring small portions prior to make sure we liked it before we ordered the full amount . Great service goes such a long way . I loved every roll I got it as amazing . Great taste & pretty big portions . They're not stingy with their fish which I love ! Deff will come back ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Sushi Tower & Steakhouse  a couple of times so far. I went with several friends and an opportunity to try several of their menu items as well as a few specialty items. I look forward to the next time I fine there again.  My server \"Song\" was fantastic.  I  recommend trying Sushi Tower & Steakhouse, if you haven't already."}
{"text":"We enjoyed great food and service. I took the kids out for Sushi. Surprisingly everyone found something they enjoyed. It is rare to find something they all can agree on but the menu had plenty of options. My son is diabetic and we found a variety of low carb options, including rolls. Warning the menu has some adult themed titles. My kids vary in age. My teenagers were amused but you may want to have your younger children point to the pictures for their selection. I would rate it a PG-13 for content."}
{"text":"The best Teppan Yaki and Chef in Las Vegas. I love the Organic Steak Chef John David has there. If you like Sea Bass you will love the ( ROBERT's SEA BASS ). Just ask Chef John David for it. The sauce he will create for the Sea Bass made it the best fish I've ever had and it's no joke. You like spicy ask for the Green Sauce it's hot like right now no waiting. Love the waitresses there very attentive and the owners are very nice!!!!!!  The kids love the place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the most amazing place. We came here for a celebration of my engagement and they they were everything we wanted plus more. Amazing sake and sushi. They called before hand to make sure we had things ordered in advance. The best!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas. No reason to go anywhere else because it doesn't get better than this. Try everything. Nothing disappoints."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  This is the sushi I compare the rest of the known world against.  My wife and I have been going to Sushi Ave from the day the door opened.  By far the freshest and best sushi in Las Vegas for a really resonable price.  You want to locals secret spot for great sushi this is it.  Say hi to Bruce.."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I, Upon walk-in, we're greeted from all the workers spread through the place. it's like coming over to my uncle's house, like they know me, with a parade of smiles.  We ordered a dynamite(baked scallops and shitake mushrooms with cheese)as our appetizer. Unfortunately, not as an appetizer since it came after the special sushi roll that we ordered. I'm a big scallop fan, but the appetizer wasn't that special.  But it tasted ok.  On their menu, many of their special rolls don't provide its ingredient line-up, so I had to ask our server. She didnt know so she had to ask the cook. Anyhow, we shared the Jasmine special. It really hit the spot. One of the many few rolls I've enjoyed since I discovered sushi. So I definitely recommend to try it should you ever visit.  I did enjoy the place's composition. Their ambiance, by their many lamp designs, leveled booths, mini tiled walls, mini tv's at almost each booth, bar/counter seating wrapping along two sides of wall.   But overtime, as we wanted to order more rolls, not once did they come to check up on us. Sometimes I like that servers leave us alone, but not completely unable to order more. So by the time we decided we had adequate eats, they came over and refilled our hot teas- or shall I say luke-warm tea.   Since this joint doesn't offer AYCE, I'd have to rate this place for their customer service as a whole, including their food. 3 and a half stars. I really want to come back and try their other special rolls and in hopes for better service next time."}
{"text":"music- strike one right inside the door food was decent though some portions were a little small.  90% roll is amazing but order it without their 'screaming orgasm' sauce. they named it that because if you saw that sauce come out of you during an orgasm you would scream bloody murder. It looks like vomit. Thats not a joke, its seriously, for real disgusting."}
{"text":"Poco p. Was here yesterday and she said this place is the best. So she brought me here today. When we walk in the staff treated us like royalty. I've never seen people so excited and happy to wait on me. We had the lady gaga roll which was the 50% off special of the day. The miso sea bass which melts in ur mouth and the monica roll. All were fantastic. The sushi chefs (june and jose) feel like friends after only one visit. June has been here for 6 years so u can expect consistency. I can't wait to be spoiled here next time... Free sake if u check in on yelp."}
{"text":"This is one of our \"must visit\" places whenever we visit Las Vegas... which is fairly frequently since my mother moved here. I can take or leave the strip but if we don't make it here the trip is a disappointment. We primarily order from their interesting and unique menu of specialty rolls. Our favorites are Dr. Cash and Gangnam Style but none of the rolls we have tried have disappointed.  The portions are abundant and fresh fresh fresh... The chefs also cut the sashimi generously.. the staff is always friendly and fun and as a result this is one of our favorite places in Vegas if not the whole country."}
{"text":"Tommy Lee Roll. It's badass! This place is outstanding. Equal in quality to I love sushi without having to drive to the no mans land of Henderson."}
{"text":"Average sushi. I sat at the sushi bar and the chef rarely look my way and it was slow, there was only one other person at the sushi bar! The chef never asked what I wanted, I had to approach him. Personally I will never go here again. Food is average and the service is poor. With so many sushi places here in Vegas I would recommend eating at another place."}
{"text":"Love this place... So many choices of sushi... One thing I have to say they use to be fast in serving the food and this time it took a while. Had there spicy edamame, soooo good"}
{"text":"This is a solid sushi place.  The food is always fresh and they work fast.  The food is always reliable.  The best thing is the servers and sushi chefs get to know you and then it becomes a fun place.    Hamachi Kama, udon, also good items from the kitchen.  We go here a lot.  Very good and decent prices."}
{"text":"I visit this sushi place often. I consistently receive great fresh fish with  fast & friendly service. Try the monkey roll, it's a treat!"}
{"text":"I don't remember this place being as good as it was I hadn't been in a couple of years went back and it was.  I ordered two rolls and my only complaint would be that they were too big to eat. I also ordered some sashimi. Which tasted cold and fresh. I liked their menu selection, draft beer selection, business hours and their service was very good as well. It was the little things that made the difference for me so I gave them 3 1/2 Stars !"}
{"text":"The Monica roll is screaming bursting with flavors in your mouth. Deep fried California roll with eel sauce was so good with a great crunch and salad with miso soup and salad was amazing! The chocolate, strawberry mocha and green tea ice cream was divine!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in vegas. Love the rice rice baby and the Boston roll!!! Service is always good and the wait is short."}
{"text":"Sushi tower has an old feel to it cluttered not up to date. The customer service is pretty good. One waitress leaned over to answer a question for us and her long ponytail got into my girlfriend's food... just things we need to be aware of as a waitress. The food was very mediocre. The garlic edamame was fairly tasty, the screaming orgasm was ok the shrimp fried rice was awful it tasted like butter you could smell the butter before it hit your mouth. I've never tasted butter in my fried rice.  My deep fried roll was Luke warm not hot at all. The manager did make our night better he did not charge us for the things that didn't work for us  in an effort to satisfy his customers. I really appreciate that. I left hungry and out of a little cash"}
{"text":"I had the mac daddy and the Monica and shasimi albacore plus customer service was amazing definatly coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and david the sushi chef is hysterical funny and fun"}
{"text":"I Love going to a place when you walk in the door and they know you and they know what you eat. The Rock and Roll is truly amazing!!"}
{"text":"Clean place, fast service and reasonable prices. Blah ambiance, ok rolls, awkward service."}
{"text":"The $8.95 lunch special is great. Lots of food. Very good value. I need to go back to try the sushis this time. To be continued. :-)"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was really really impressed with this place.  We had a number of sushi rolls that were inventive, different, and really really good.  Unfortunately I can't remember most of the details (I apologize for this clear violation of my yelp duties).    Most memorable was the \"monkey roll\" which wasn't a roll at all.  Sashimi tuna served on tempura banana with a nice sauce drizzled over everything.  It was really good!  When we asked for Toro (which they didn't have), they went and found us a piece that was really nice and close to the fatty bits that count as Toro.  Now the controversy:  I've never had \"cold\" sushi.  The sashimi came out on an iced plate.  This makes sense in the desert, as raw fish probably goes bad very quickly.  But I think it hides the flavor.  My sashimi was extremely cold and I didn't get the same taste sensation that I normally get.  In addition, I wondered that it may also hide the fact that it is not the freshest fish.  But this fish wasn't spoiled - it was really good.  Next time I may place my order for sashimi quickly and let the plate sit for a good time to let it warm up a bit."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I love it everytime. I read some of the reviews saying this is an Americanized sushi place, which I never thought of, but I guess I love Americanized sushi! I've been to quite a few places and none ever come close to this place. Ive had quite a few rolls but my favorites are the monica, red rock, and the lady gaga. Im sure I have more that I like but those are the ones I can remember at the moment and the ones I always get.  Food is great but service sucks. They don't check up on you, don't refill your drinks, and take forever with the check but I love their sushi and it's the only reason I gave them a 4 or it would've been a 5."}
{"text":"I had a great time there with my girlfriend and another couple.  It seemed we had a collection of servers but that didn't bother me because they were attentive.  The chef/cook? was putting on a good show at the teppanyaki station that we were able to observe from afar.  They had a bartender, i presume, show us how to do a saki bomb which was an incredible experience because of him.  The sushi was fantastic! I had the California Roll 2 which was deep friend with mushrooms, scallops, and shrimp with a cream cheese sauce. Incredible and unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"I was looking for an AYCE sushi place on the west part of town.  While they are not an AYCE place, I thought I would try anyway.  The tables were clean.  Started with edamame and some Maguro tuna- both were excellent.  Lots to choose from on this menu, got some tempura shrimp, scallop sushi and a Monica roll.  Everything was well prepared and tasty, although their tempura is panco crusted (I personally prefer batter dipped tempura).   A good place to eat, and the service was great."}
{"text":"I wasn't totally impressed, but I thought it was a good introduction of sushi for my daughter.  I've had better, but I've also had A LOT worse.  Just watch out for the Tommy Lee roll."}
{"text":"Location us good.  The price is fair.  Clean.  The place is awesome. The service is good and you get more then an orange for desert.  Lunch save you few bucks."}
{"text":"Some friends invited us to meet them at the Sushi Bar here, and so glad they did! We had a great time. We had sashimi and a few drinks. Everything was fresh and tasty. Ordered the Yellowtail with jalape√±os. It was good, not the best I have ever had, but good. The sashimi assortment was perfect. Nice big cuts, simple and tasty.  Apparently the owner is the one behind the sushi bar. He was so welcoming. We felt like friends coming to visit, even though it was our first time.  Would definitely go back, and try some rolls next time."}
{"text":"Sushi tower is one of those places where you'll find the unexpected with a smile.  From the typical sushi bar fare to unique eats like mango salmon sushi, there is something for everyone.  I always try to find a roll or nigiri that I haven't seen before, and this place definitely had it.  Although other places may have the same thing on the menu, this was the first sushi bar where I discovered mango sushi.  The creamy, sweet, yet firm texture of the fruit along with a good piece of salmon on rice was quite tasty and an interesting experience.  On top of the fun service that all other sushi bars provide, it was enjoyable.  There are other great eats, too, from fried onions on top of some sashimi to pretty ginger flowers atop seared fish.  All of it is great, all of it well priced and all of it served by happy, funny chefs.  What I appreciate is the concentration placed on every dish, no matter how typical or atypical it may be.    If you're looking for some fun eats, try this place.  It may surprise your pallet."}
{"text":"Call me a \"traditionalist\" but all the sauces and spicy ingredients didn't do it for me. The fresh ingredients are the only reason I would return but then again...i can get great sushi elsewhere and with better service. I'd pass if you are looking for traditional sushi."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted sushi so decided on Sushi Tower after hearing a good review from a family member.  There were a decent number of people in there for a Wednesday night but not busy.  We were sat in a booth and quickly got our drinks.  That's the last time the waitress came to our table.  We made eye contact with her and even tried waving her over several times to no avail.  After waiting for over 25 minutes, we finally gave up and got up and walked out."}
{"text":"My wife an I really enjoy it here. Friendly waitstaff and some good sushi. They offer brown rice for a buck extra too, which is nice. The salmon isnt the BEST I've had, but it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Great westside sushi spot. Tons of options, both modern and classic. Seaweed salad is on point, not too oily or sweet. Friendly staff and great prices. Def coming back with friends to try out the chefs specials, so many to choose from!"}
{"text":"Shared the New York combo, killer menu, killer service... must come back and try the other rolls."}
{"text":"im going to make this short and sweet.  I come here for the transformer sushi dish. Sushi Tower also offers brown rice sushi and a hand full of rolls without rice which I appreciate.  it is average priced, friendly and fresh.  Trust me.. anyone who tries to eat on the cleaner/healthier side.. try the TRANSFORMER."}
{"text":"Review is just for take out! This time I've waited half an hour to get my food... they left out the spoon for the miso and no ginger or wasabi :(. But over all still good value"}
{"text":"Sushi places are so hard to rate since they are all so different. This one doesn't suck. The Monica and the Gaga are the go to rolls. The monkey is great! I always have fresh and great food here. The service is funny tho  never ignored but they all come by over and over and ask what you want or if you want more rolls or drinks the staff is confused . I go here often because of the great rolls."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. I've been meaning to review it since it opened. Better late than never!  My best friend and I have been going since they first opened. We call the owner Uncle Bruce -- he's a great sushi chef and all of his guys are good at what they do (and absolutely hilarious). If you go, try to sit in front of Bruce, MJ, or Sexy Kenny. They will make custom rolls for you if you like, and the ones on the menu are incredible. I've never had a bad experience. Everything is fresh, the place is nicely decorated and feels comfortable, and there's plenty of options for everyone (cooked, raw, vegetarian, pork-loving maniac, etc.)  Oh yes, and decent prices. Some things are a little pricey, like the tuna martini, which is about $16. We can usually get out of there for $80 for two of us."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place I have ever been to where I have countless favorite rolls. Each roll is truly better than the last. Jeff #2, Monica, Juicy Juicy and Dr. Cash are to die for to name a few. LOVE this place so much. It is a must try if you are a true fan of sushi."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i went in on our lunch break to get some sushi , we were then greeted by a gentlemen who was probaly the best waitor there!! Anywho we orderd edamame, baked muscles, and a tiger roll, i noticed there was a hair on the plate next to the muscles i figured it came off of my clothing so really dident think to much of it then my girlfriends plate had a short curly hair on one of her rolls and then i noticed another one on mine now it wasent our hair becuase last time i checked we both have our hair pinned up for work . I looked at the sushi chefs and they have nothing covering there hair except a head band they had somewhat curly wavy long hair which im sure was the hair that was on our plates.... im not one to write bad reviews for any establishment but when i pay money to eat somewhere just to find hair in it its a problem the bill came out to be 22 dollars i feel like i shouldent have been charged ,if your workers cant follow proper hygiene and sanitation then why should i pay for that? Anyway i will not be returning."}
{"text":"If I could give them 4.5 stars I would.   It's Korean owned Japanese restaurant, which for a lot of people it doesn't bother them, but for me being someone who grew up in Japan and have seen a lot of Korean owned Japanese restaurant fail it did at the beginning but after my first time this is not one of those failures.  The location is too far for me personally but if I'm going out there because of friends and such I would. Everything is a la carte so don't come here expecting AYCE. They really don't need to provide it since everything I've had is super fresh, probably one of the freshest places in town.   Once in a while they'll have fresh Sweet Shrimp - just ask and they'll let you know along with market price.   I usually get several different nigiri sushi along with sashimi and call it a night. My favorites are always otoro and ama ebi which area always at market price but totally worth it.   I haven't really tried other dishes and I don't really like rolls but my friends with me liked them. So we were happy overall.   They offer cork service for like $7-9 to uncork a bottle of wine, but make sure you call and ask before bringing a bottle of wine in since one of my friends knows the staff pretty well (he's a regular customer) he might have gotten a special deal with it.   The overall service is mediocre at best, some times the wait staff doesn't exactly pay attention and are just standing around talking."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sushi Restaurant in town. Always fresh, and always treated very nicely. Have been to many Sushi places here in Vegas and California but nothing compares. I keep coming back. A+"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner. Sushi chefs were drunk and loud. A lot of the rolls were fried and had cream cheese. I was disappointed that there weren't a lot of fresh fish varieties. The server was nice and the place looked nice inside. Overall, it was just okay."}
{"text":"It wasn't awful. It wasn't AWESOME. It was, just good. We sat at the sushi bar and the BEST part of the experience was sitting at the Sushi bar drinking beer while the owner rolled and chopped, diced and carved then interacted with us. The food was good. It was fresh and it was tasty. Sadly, when it comes to Sushi, I get really fickle about places. Would I return? Sure! Would I go out of my way for this place? Not really."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the staff. The sushi was amazing. Great date night spot. Definitely a must go to."}
{"text":"Don't ever order take out or you'll be waiting for over half an hour...even during their slowest time."}
{"text":"Sushi was \"ok \" nothing special.   The imitation crab was very chewy. The service was mediocre. We came in at 9:45 on a Friday night- only table in here and poor service. Very sad because we wanted to find a really good sushi place in the area."}
{"text":"First time here...usually eat at the Vietnamese restaurant...anyway got seated at a booth that was designed for twiggy....I mean I am a big guy and this is very uncomfortable....  Ordered the las vegas special 5 rolls $25   First impression looks clean but the table feels like it has a film on it, might be the toe of surface though...   The waitress seems friendly enough she has explained what is on the menus  While waiting for my sushi to arrive I noticed that everything above 5 feet has some form of dust all over it...a little picky but this is dust that has been on here for 6 months or more...they need a cleaning crew to do the details for then....foods here  Ok after eating I found the fish and other ingredients to be fantastically fresh......two thumbs up  A ton of food on the special to much for one person   You will love the food here"}
{"text":"The food at Sushi Tower is great! The food is always fresh and the staff are very nice and accommodating. My favorite is the Yellowtail jalape√±o. If you are ever in the area during lunch this is a great place to go. I like how they open early, unlike other sushi places... Eat up and have fun guys!!!"}
{"text":"I know this place has high reviews... but this doesn't cut it if you're Asian. looking around, I was thru only Asian costume and now i know why... but if u like American style sushi... then this is your thing. Plus their rolls are waaaaay overpriced."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My family and I have been coming here for 6/7 years now and the staff there feel like family and always remember us which is just the sweetest. To be honest, I'd go there just for them BUT, it is a sushi place and... the sushi is AWESOME. Fresh and delicious rolls at a super fair price. Just go, you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such good ratings.  Maybe we went on an off day but the food was terrible.  The rolls were loose and falling apart.  The spicy mayo was separating, it was like eating curdled clumps of mayo!  Yuck! We went quietly though, the servers were super sweet so I didn't want to raise a fuss.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always satisfied and even my Togo orders are amazing when I get home! Fresh and creative! Chefs are funny and pleasant. Heart attack roll and spicy garlic edamame is my favorite. The hibachi is good and my boyfriend like the chicken katsu. I've never been disappointed except once the hibachi took too long. They only had 1 chef and he had to finish the other table before getting to us."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service, friendly staff, and sushi is great! Fresh fish and decent prices. No AYCE, but the better places usually aren't. 'Order to go' is a great option too. Really glad they are one of the spots close to me!"}
{"text":"3 star is really just for the kindness of the staff. But we came here for teppanyaki. The kids was so excited to see a show and well. It didn't really happen. There was no eggs cracked by the spatula , shrimp tales in the hat trick. Not even a volcano. My daughter really wanted the volcano and even requested it. But again no volcano. Not sure why. The food was umm... pretty bland. Over all I prob will not be back since the price is a bit more than other teppanyaki places and no show."}
{"text":"Always consistently good..... 5/5 no complaints.... sake is good... Fave rolls... Monica, Tiger, Ultimate shrimp...."}
{"text":"Feel very disappointed coming here. I wanted Teppanyaki and I understand I am by myself so they cooked it at the back. Everything was less than ok. Miso soup had bad seaweed cuz been sitting all day. Salad was not fresh. Worst of all the food came put so fast & was just so bad. Not fresh. You can tell its been sitting there. I mean if im going to pay the regular price why should the quality be that much less. I recommend if going for teppanyaki have them cook it in front of u. After all its the same price. I gave 2 stars cuz the server, a young korean guy, was very accommodating & genuinely apologetic. I honestly dont think ill be back unfortunately. There is a place Ohjah nearby that i go to and recommend over this place. In the end, I dont even get a thank you from cashier after paying."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 or 6 times and it's always pretty legit. The fish is fresh, the rolls are decent sized and it's not too pricey. The menu is packed with specialty rolls, if you're into that sort of thing...The poke salad left something to be desired- not lacking in quality, but flavor. I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This was our first time and it was great! Definitely will be back... Sushi was great, fresh and service delightful ! Also a great place for post work out meal when done with the workout!  Close to LVAC!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really good.  No all-you-can-eat, but that didn't matter as the sushi chefs delivered with some delicious rolls and nigiri.  Prices weren't too bad.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it won't be my last.  I wish I would have ordered one roll at a time because, although delicious, the rolls were very large compared to what I'm used to.   Everything was nice and fresh which is obviously very important with any food, especiallyyyy sushi   I had either the something sexy or something wrong #7 I can't remember the name exactly but only one with that type of name and night recommend   The have lots of rolls to choose from which is a little overbearing but I would rather have more choices than be limited"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:15pm at night and it was empty which initially alarmed me. Yellowtail & jalape√±o good, not excellent. The tuna nigiri better. My daughter thought there was something off with her California roll (she is 8)....they were very apologetic and sent ice cream. The service super but the place just does not \"feel\" clean and the sushi did not appear excellent quality. Their garlic edamame was the best part of the night. Won't return. There are too many amazing sushi spots in town."}
{"text":"Great sushi. The combo menu ( chicago ) are very affordable. My favorite roll are monkey roll / tommy lee / monica roll."}
{"text":"Always love this place. Service is wonderful and friendly not to mention great sushi!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch last Friday based on recommendations from co-workers.  I had the screaming orgasm, shrimp tempura, grand canyon, boston, and cucumber rolls.  I always take the breading off of fried shrimp to see how clean the shrimp are.  The shrimp we had were not properly deveined.  I did not eat most of them; I am not into eating fried shrimp poo.  The screaming orgasm and cucumber roll were okay.  The grand canyon and boston rolls were pretty good.  This place will not join the regular rotation, but I would be okay going back and ordering certain rolls."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, the price is amazing for everything you get. I always bring a friend and we get the Las Vegas Special which is $25 and you get five plates of sushi with eight rolls on each plate! The staff is very welcoming when you walk in and treats everyone very well! I love coming here and I hope to never stop."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars because the sushi here is incredible and easily one of my favorite spots in Vegas. I had to drop two stars based on the service. I had to ask for water 3 different times before I got any. The guys behind the sushi bar took forever to get our initial order and then never asked again if we wanted anything else after that. When I go out to eat I look for not only good food but good service and I just didn't get that when I came here today."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I eat here. Very generous lunch special. Delicious too. Friendly service! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great, energetic staff! Fish is very fresh and the rice is delicate and is the perfect accompaniment to the fish. The yakitori appetizer at $4 is an absolute steal, reminded me of the many yakitori joints I visited in Tokyo."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of waiting. If you are busy and tell me so, that is one thing. But don't agree to take a group photo (right away)and disappear for 10 minutes while I stop eating so I can have food on the table for whenever you feel like coming back.   Teppan Yaki - The Chef seemed HIGHLY entertaining but if you weren't having Teppen Yaki yourself, then its just outright annoying. You are at your table trying to enjoy sushi when every 5 min, a 20 second burst of loud music blares on. So I'm torn here - on one hand, the show is very entertaining and the chef is obviously very talented. On the otherhand, do you have to play music every 5 min and blast it so the whole parking lot can hear?  Sushi wise, it was ok. I feel Jjangas is world's better. So is Makino, Sumo and Yama. Here, although some rolls were good, the majority just tasted the same. Udon was tasty.   I will most likely stick with my favorite: Jjangas"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi meal I've ever had. Quality of fish was excellent. Best part of meal were the Sushi Chefs...they're excellent!!! Great food, sushi, people. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and by far the worst service tonight. Idk if they were short staffed, but the service was terrible. There were dirty dishes left behind from other customers on the bar next to us the whole time we ate. Once we got seated no one came around to get our drink order. We had to ask someone for drinks and to refill. The only person attentive to us was the sushi maker guy behind the bar. This place wasn't my favorite to begin with but I was starving and in the area. Total disappointment. I wouldn't come here again. I'd rather drive to Kobe sushi 20min away from me then go here again that's just up the street from where I live. If the owners are reading these reviews, I suggest hiring more people for your weekend dinner rush. Seems like you need the help."}
{"text":"The sake (salmon) nigiri, edamame, chicken teriyaki, and miso was really good, they have gluten free soy sauce, the waitress was SOO cute, the service was excellent. The bulgogi and albacore was meh."}
{"text":"...I'm a fan of Americanized sushi (fried stuff/cream cheese/etc.) so I really love this place.   The fish is fresh and well prepared. I usually order the screaming orgasm.  The service is good too. Everyone is really friendly.  It's a pretty popular place so it's busy, but it's never jam packed which is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 5 years now. The sushi is consistently good and the service is great. Their rolls are creative and fun. The atmosphere is rather cozy for a sushi joint. I'm always welcomed when I walk through the door by the staff and they're are always in uniform. Great place to dine for sushi. Make sure you get the waitress by the name of Song. She is SOOOOOO sweet, so friendly and is a fantastic server."}
{"text":"First time sitting at a table here instead of the sushi bar. Service was awful! The waitress had to have walked by my empty glass (that was conveniently sitting on the edge of the table) at least 10 times, I had to wave her down to get a refill; I don't know if she would have ever asked if I wanted more. Also, I asked for a non-spicy version of one of their chef's special rolls and the waitress suggested I try another roll, I agreed and instead of getting just the suggestrd roll she also ordered me the original roll(spicy). I ordered edamame, that never came... we asked for the check and the waitress asked if we would like dessert or a sliced orange, asked for the Orange, the check came... the orange was missing...Very disappointed as they are one of the few places with fresh sushi in town."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch great service fast service everyone is friendly the food is great best sushi place I have ever been to in the five years of living in Vegas definitely recommend this place their sushi lasagna is amazing and all of their sushi is super delicious"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi, and this was top 3. Had oysters for an appetizer and they tasted very fresh. Our favorite roll was the transformer roll, it was clean and refreshing. Also had the 90%, ganman roll, angela's roll, caterpillar roll, they were all great! I would recommend this place in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Great teppen style cuisine. What's great about this place is its open for lunch. Most spots like this aren't.  Try the New York steak and shrimp with an extra side order of shrimp. It's fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place from a hard recommendation of fellow coworkers. We ordered carry out and the person of the phone was friendly, when we picked up the food they were very friendly the restaurant was very clean! However when we got home we noticed we did not receive napkins, chop sticks or even utensils.   Now to the food, we ordered the Monica, ultimate tuna, spicy ramen. The food was mediocre, was not bad however the tuna seemed to be a little Blan. The spices seemed to be similar with all the rolls. The ramen noodles were very spicy; but it was probably the best dish we ordered. For the price I was expecting much better."}
{"text":"So yummy! This place is amazing. Super happy with the service. We sat at the sushi bar. Tried the Gangnam style roll which had the most amazing spice!! Hot but not stupid hot. Fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the teriyaki beef. Lunch combo was hella cheap. Tried the bulgogi combo, meat was a little salty. Hamachi sashimi and tako nigiri were fresh, so I was happy."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service coupled with delightful seaweed salad! I was in heaven! Great place for date night, too. Keep your eyes peeled when your arrive-it's tucked away in a shopping center and you might miss it the first time around, as we did."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for sushi! The food is always great and the place is always clean. Staff is friendly and professional. The tv's in the booths are awesome and the bar area is large enough to seat almost 20 people. We come twice or so a month and have never had a bad experience. Highly recommend coming here for a wonderful sushi experience. Ask for Alan as your server. He's the man!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant I have ever eaten at and I am a sushi snob!  I have tried many other sushi houses  and nothing comes close to this place.  Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and the food is to die for.  The sushi here is always fresh and they serve liquor in addition to the traditional beer, wine and sake."}
{"text":"Sushi was good! Happy to see teppan  tables.  Sushi was good! Happy to see teppan  tables."}
{"text":"This place is dank. The best sushi for miles! Great atmosphere. Fresh delicious food cooked right in front of you. I love the Dr Cash and Lady Gaga."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for our anniversary.  It was delicious!   The service is outstanding, very friendly staff.  Restaurant is clean and comfortable.  Love the Lady Gaga and Monica rolls!  We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I saw this sushi place when I was headed to Target, I popped in and I placed a to go order. I ordered the Hell Roll, ultimate Tuna roll, and Sex on the Beach and I must say.. WOW! They were all amazing!!! I am so going back to this sushi place! I highly recommend the Hell Roll!!"}
{"text":"We're here because pictures on yelp looked amazing but going in person was a whole other experience. Service was bad and fish was not fresh. would never go again"}
{"text":"love this place! the entire staff from the hostess, servers to sushi chefs are very nice and friendly. Our favorite sushi, and a MUST TRY in our opinion is THE MONICA --- yummmm-oh! :)"}
{"text":"Stellar sushi here along with other offerings. I LOVE sushi and the Nigiri at Sushi Tower is rockin! Nothing but praises from me about this restaurant. The staff is super cool. Not only do they work at a sushi restaurant but I meet up with them at other sushi places so you know they love the food. I tried a few things that are new to me here but my brand new favorite is the Mango Salmon. I love that stuff. Light and fresh with the right pairing of ingredients, you have to try this if you haven't already. If you haven't been here then I reccomend you give it a try."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping. Sushi was in order. Great recommendation from the ladies at Dillard's.  Fish is fresh & the sushi chefs are very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi spot in Vegas! Whenever I come to town I have to stop here. They have the most variety of sushi, it's so good, and everyone is so friendly. They are the only sushi restaurant that I know of that serves fresh wasabi! Tonight I had the Crazy Horse, Heart Attack and Poker Face. The poker face was my favorite. And the Screaming Orgasm sauce is to die for. If you are in Vegas and don't mind driving off strip, I would suggest you come here!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! A lot of people may be scared away from the \"steakhouse\" title of Sushi Tower but the prices are super reasonable and the staff is extremely friendly. A little pushy when it comes to ordering specials or specific menu items, but really tasty items.   Highlights of the menu: The Crazy Horse and the OMG Roll."}
{"text":"Sushi is great here! Try Just for the halibut and Dale Earnheart rolls."}
{"text":"Sushi Tower is outstanding! They have this great special you can get anytime with a choice of 2 or 3 items. I always get the salmon teriyaki and the shrimp tempura. It comes with this little salmon cake (like a fried crab cake), a small salad, rice, miso soup and a cucumber salad appetizer. It's only $19.99 which is a steal. Their sushi is fantastic, too. I'm new to sushi so I lean toward the 'cooked American version of sushi.' I love the Ultimate Shrimp & Japanese Lasagna. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Fun vibe from the sushi chefs!"}
{"text":"I used to visit Sushi Tower ALL the time when I lived in the neighborhood but we moved away and hadn't been year in about a year and a half. Happy to report it's just as awesome as ever. Picked up to go this time and the manager (or perhaps owner) was the same woman who used to be there, she's always very friendly and accommodating. The sushi rolls were perfect size and tasted fresh and delicious. I thoroughly enjoy the 90% roll. Worth the drive to eat here or pick up to go for your sushi fix."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in town! Everything is fresh, love the roll of the day specials, and the staff is amazing! I'm here at least once a week...and sometimes more. Try them all you'll be hooked too!"}
{"text":"You got to try the screaming orgasm, the lollipop roll and the Monica. They are the best."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and delicious food. Several options, huge menu and great prices. By far the best sushi in Vegas! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Don't bother coming. We were standing in the lobby for 5 minutes without even being acknowledged, whatsoever! Finally one of the sushi chef asked if we needed help? I replied and asked if we were suppose to sit ourselves? He stated \"no,\" and he called one of the host and she told us that she did not see us?! Wow, what poor customer service! We decided to leave! Why stay when the service from the beginning sucked and I'm sure it'll be that way throughout our dining experience. No thank you! Plus, we thought the place was closed because there were only 3 couples throughout the entire place and this is on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Are you serious, people?  First of all, this place is now called Sushi Tower, which makes no sense to me at all.  We didn't end up eating here.  The place just lacked any sense of atmosphere and they tried seating us next to a family with a kid who was jumping up and down in the booth.  We politely excused ourselves and headed out the door."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here & it was a good experience. The staff was friendly as I came in & sat me down right away. Their service was very fast and very helpful with going over the menu. I ordered the ultimate shrimp roll & it was fantastic.  Our server was Song and we were pleased with her service. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't too bad and service was fine. However, I was a little disappointed because my hubby and I ordered the dinner combo special. We did tempura and kalbi BBQ. When we got our food imagine our surprise when we had a hamburger patty and not the traditional short ribs. The table next to us then receives a plate full of kalbi BBQ ribs. So we asked our server what the difference was and were told the ribs were only on their a la carte menu. She apologized it wasn't explained or specified on menu that the kalbi BBQ is different on each menu. It was misleading."}
{"text":"Great service, Great food, Prices are excellent.  Quality is excellent.  Sonny the waitress is awesome.  You will want to make this place a favorite."}
{"text":"We love this place. The Screaming Orgasm is YUMMY! I love the sushi and the service too! It is a great place and has fantastic food - great value! We found this place one night lost when we first moved to the area and it is now one of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi spot with reasonable prices and excellent service for a local spot. I have been coming here for years and they never disappoint. Excellent variety of different roles!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in town!!! The sauces that they use are out of this world! Try the stuffed tomatoes- don't let the name fool you. It's off the menu but if you love salmon you will dream about this dish! The fish is always so fresh and the staff is amazing"}
{"text":"Pretty gross to be honest. We ordered hot tea that was salty? And watery, and just... strange. Following the far from helpful waitress' rude and unimpressive help our food was cold, took foreverrrrr and in all honesty I was almost worried it was a bad choice to eat it! In addition the appetizers were never brought out, and you had to flag someone down every 20 minutes to ask for water, another 25 minutes for the bill. The sushi was fairly good but I certainly wouldn't return for it after everything being so poorly presented. Woke up this morning with a sick belly and can't help but think I'd have been better off skipping this place last night."}
{"text":"This place is great. I have been several times and the food is always fresh. I like the good service and price is average for sushi."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dining experience at tower sushi. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Jose made delicious sushi includding a special one designed by us that we called the Aprajita. Loved it and we will come back again next time we come to Vegas. What a lucky night all around= cubs beat indians too lol!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi with a fun group of sushi chefs. I will never go back to sushi fever after eating here. The atmosphere is chiller, and less pretentious. Furthermore, the rolls are similar to Fever's-but tastier.   Just love: the jalapeno shooters, the jay roll-90% and ponzu, their wine list, the mexican roll and  grilled calamari steaks available upon request.  We truly never tasted anything that didn't please the palate.   Our four year old loves the chicken teriyaki and the kid friendly atmosphere in the dining area.   After trying almost every other sushi joint around, I am officially making this our go-to place when we want fresh sushi.   Kung Pai, Sushi Tower!!!"}
{"text":"Just went here again today. This is my second review of this place - that sould tell you how great the sushi is! Screaming Orgasm is one of the yummiest sushi dishes I have EVER had. I'm craving it all over again!"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi addict and I tell everyone about Sushi Tower, cause it's just that damn good!!!"}
{"text":"I would have to rate Sushi Tower average.  Service was good.  Too bad the sushi didn't match."}
{"text":"Can't beat their lunch special, great value and lots of food.   I had their sushi years ago, when it was called Sushi Avenue (I think).  I  haven't had their sushi  since then so I can't vouch for it.  Totally a great cheap lunch spot with their special if you need a quick fix!  The ladies that work there are really nice, but it seems like they do get a bit overwhelemd during the busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"Asked the Sushi Chef for the most popular roll to start, a few minutes later, I was presented with the \"Monica\" roll, COMPLEX roll with a lot going on BUT blended so well together! RECOMMEND! Then decided on the \"Mango Salmon\" (no rice), it was Light, Flavorful, with a light cream sauce, 2 for 2 so far! Impressed!  Only 'down' side are the prices are a little high, BUT your portions are larger than normal."}
{"text":"They cheat in pricing. 1 sashimi is $15. For 5 pieces while u can get 12 pieces of sashimi  for $12 with \"City special\". Absolute swindlers here. Terrible value. Terribly mean, nasty management."}
{"text":"I never do this but this was so unique that I had to make a yelp account to share my experience.   Everything went well at first. Staff was attentive and prompt which is a plus, however, the problem was right around the corner.  One of the staff comes out from the kitchen, looked dirty, sweaty,  smelled so terrible and he clearly didn't want to be there. Now would I still eat if I saw that? I understand it couldve been a bad day but everyone can tell he gave zero shits.   Screw it, I gave it a chance cause I'm so hungry plus I'm already here. Food was okay, not bd at all. there's alot to choose from. From raw to cooked, there's something for eveyone. Price would have been reasonable if service was better.  So I was able to forget about the smelly dude but then (queue Jaw's theme music) he comes to our table. As he grabs the clears the plates, I glanced at his hands. And omg, It scared the shitaki mushrooms outta me. From all the bandaids, dry/dead skin and blood. I couldn't help but to think to myself if I ate some of his dead skin.  All in all, I could have left with a good image of this restaurant in my head but instead all i can remmeber was the smell of body odor, sweat dripping, omg his breath was deadly too!! Theres no way i eat there after seeing that.   Presentations really puts the food into perspective. If u don't take care of yourself, how can I trust that u handled my food with care?"}
{"text":"It was a last min date night. No wait to be seated. Asked for a booth but got a table. So we asked to be reseated to the area that is half booth half chairs. Husband was hungry so he ordered filet mignon steak hitachi dinner. Asked for pink steak, so they say it would be medium. I got a 18 pc New York Sashimi dinner.   filet mignon steak hitachi dinner was embarrassing small. $23 dinner plate looks like something you get at Panda Express except smaller portion. Half of the plate was squash and onions and sorry portion of steak and 2 tiny shrimps. Steak was not pink and it was tough. Husband finished the dinner and we waited 10 more mins before my sashimi was served.  It was a Thursday night. My sashimi was good and pieces were fat. Green tea ice cream was a good 2 scoops.   Service was good. Atmosphere was okay.. Oh by the way they didn't even cook the hibachi at the grill, they made it in the back, so no entertainment. Feel like the $23 dinner plate really only worth like $6.99. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Great service, beautiful and friendly staff. Sushi was good and affordable. Kid friendly and great for a date."}
{"text":"Place was pretty decent. Not top notch but good enough for me to want to come back. I've tried better I can tell you that. Came here late night, and usually late night sushi doesn't taste as fresh as lunch sushi, but I can tell you that the sushi tasted as fresh as can be. Ordered the lasagna roll and the spicy crab. Both were good, but the lasagna roll was awesome."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Las Vegas!! I have tried many places and they are a Fantastic family owned restaurant. I would recommend to everyone. Food is fresh and super good. Ken"}
{"text":"Pretty good but not really my style. Fish quality was good. Service was good.....but....this is definitely American style sushi. They will make the usual stuff but they have a 5 or 6 page menu of specialty rolls......the kind that have everything but the kitchen sink in them. We had basic sashimi to start just to test the fish quality . After that we did order two of the specialty rolls. They were both good but both had a lot going on. With a combination of sweet,savory,spicy,tempura fried and sauce...it's not that hard to make a good flavor bomb. The ingredients were of good quality though, just be aware of what their style is going in."}
{"text":"Usually come during the lunch hour for business meetings and have great lunch specials-service is always great and very attentive to our needs. I recommend the Dr. Cash roll-one of my favorites-"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite sushi places. Not only is it priced reasonably but it is also amazing food. Their spicy tuna is a bit more spicy than I can handle but I love it. My fiance orders the lunch special and it's always more food than he can eat. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  My favorite place used to be Sushi Fever, but the staff was always unpleasant and it was always crowded.  I am not sure if Sushi Tower has the same owners, but they have many of the same rolls and even more selection.   When you walk in you are always greeted by all the staff.  They are genuinely happy to see you.  Some booths have TVs which is great if you bring kids to keep them occupied.   Be sure to order the spicy edamame- available upon request. And if you like seeing pictures of the food like me, be sure to ask to see the picture menu which shows what every single roll will look like.   I have been here over 10 times and have never had a bad meal.  I would recommend: Agadashi Tofu, Chicken skewers, screaming orgasm, miso soup & mexican roll.  I would NOT recommend: the mango salmon rolls,  or just ask for them to go light on the mayo sauce.  I really have not had a bad roll here!  They are so friendly I am sure they would make any roll to order with changes and they offer great specials!  Definitely my new go to sushi restaurant in LV!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp and its map, we found this little jewel of a sushi place. We were heading back to the Flamingo after hiking at Red Rock (another jewel beyond price), and had decided on sushi off the strip where the prices would be more reasonable, and this restaurant kept popping up on my Yelp search, right on Flamingo Rd in an unassuming group of shops, kind of hidden on the side. The extensive menu and combo offerings took us  awhile to decide. In the meantime, free sake courtesy of my Yelp checkin arrived along with bottomless iced tea. Even though we tried to order less, we still got too much because the portion sizes are ample. CA rolls, shrimp roll, and tempura shrimp were all excellent, hot crispy tempura coating just the way I like it, and my husband's teriyaki beef platter was a deal with miso soup, rice, and tempura veggies too. The service was friendly, the interior is pleasant and open, and the food as good as I have had anywhere, including Japan, with prices more reasonable than on the strip."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 starts I would. I just went in with a girlfriend, there was one gentleman working the floor and 3 tables. We asked to order and he looked at us with a panicked look and ignored us and continued to walk around and fill waters. No \"ill be right with you\" \"I'm sorry\" nothing. Effing terrible service! Never going back."}
{"text":"Sushi was good and fresh. We got the special, and could not believe the amount of fresh sushi for the price.  Monkey roll was a delight!"}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers for over 4 years and Sushi Tower is always excellent service and excellent food! Friendly and warm service!"}
