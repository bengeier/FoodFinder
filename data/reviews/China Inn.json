{"text":"First place I've ever been to that uses REAL all white chicken!

Food is awesome!

We plan on ordering from here more often."}
{"text":"It is good American Chinese food. Very friendly people and a good price."}
{"text":"I dunno, it seems fine. They did a special order scallion pancake which was great. But they haven't got it on the menu. Really wish they'd add it!

Otherwise, the food is all pretty good. Haven't gone through the entire menu but I think it's all mostly fine. Maybe a bit oily? I dunno. One of the owner/chef is from New York. I figure he knows what's up with the scene, and my wife says it's pretty close to NY Chinese food. There you go!"}
{"text":"New owners !!! Fried rice was good so was the salt and pepper pork chops ( yes they serve it now ). I can't wait to try their Filipino and Thai dishes."}
{"text":"I moved to Nevada about 6 month ago. I took a friend there for dinner and ordered the most expensive family meal. I was trying to take my friend out for a nice dinner and she was in the mood for Chinese. I  wish we had gone  to Panda express as this was the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. If it had any taste it was of a dirty wash rag. The waitress was nice, but the food was terrible!!! Go some where else."}
{"text":"Recently started ordering take out from china inn, and so far my husband and i have been pleasantly surprised. Delivery time is prompt and food is good for take out. Shrimp egg rolls are delicious, have also tried the sesame chicken and house combination chow mein both really good.  Best chinese take out in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Have tried both eating in and take out, and the food was tasty, hot and well prepared.  Friendly staff and restaurant seemed well kept up inside (a bit cluttered but I think they do mostly take out and delivery so ambiance is not what you are looking for).  The lo mein noodles and dumplings were great.  Definitely recommended for a good basic American style chinese neighborhood place."}
{"text":"the worst Chinese take out place ever i kinda saw it coming seeing how nasty they are at the kitchen the way they handle food is horrid they are dirty and there attitude makes it even worst i am from new york and know these type of Chinese people they racist and don't care as long as they get that money don't go here go to somewhere you know there good people these are bad people don't give them your hard earned money."}
{"text":"I keep trying hoping that it will be decent but it never is. Order from Asian House up on Dempsey. I feel like the stuff from this place is always soggy, lids don't quite close, flavors extremely bland, and just a really greasy to over done experience every time."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area! Never had a bad experience. Food always looks and tastes fresh. Although minimal decor, the kitchen looks very clean!"}
{"text":"We read some good reviews here and decided to try it. The decor is from the 90's, the food is flavorless MSG glop and even the restrooms were dirty and depressing. We should have gone to Panda Express in Boulder City. No, REALLY."}
{"text":"Not  a good idea to eat here. 

Please be aware. 

this restaurant has been closed for Dirty Dining indefinitely."}
{"text":"This is really only a half-revue, because I never ended up eating here due to the following:

I got their menu in the mail and it looked good, so I went to see the place. The building exterior should have been a big red warning, it was grungy. Walking up to the front door you notice the absolutely filthy windows that are so dirty and smeared you cant really see through them. I went in and noticed all of the pealing wall paper and filthy floor corners and table feet, then there was the terrible smell permeating the place of rancid fishy frying grease, it almost made me sick--I had to leave.

 This place is dirty!  I have worked in food long enough to know that if the front of the house is this bad then the kitchen is going to be ten times worse. These people clearly have scraped this place together to try and make a buck and nothing else.

I find it mind blowing that this \"restaurant\" can even get a passing score from the Dane Co. Health Dept."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great staff! My favorite is the Mongolian beef and the potstickers. The sauces are all home made and really tasty. Super family friendly and they give great proportions for great prices! They also deliver which is awesome!"}
{"text":"I only wish I had read the reviews first. I got the flyer and thought I'd try it. Big mistake!  Bland unappealing food and they burnt the shrimp toast!  I wss so pissed off that I put the food back in the bag, put it in the refrigerator and took it back the next day.. Their response to the burnt black shrimp toast?  Well it's supposed to be that way. I pushed back and got a refund..I don't even want to give them one star but can't post without it."}
{"text":"Love the Sisig!! Nice Filipino menu of my faves!!! Friendly people and the food is always great!!!"}
{"text":"My husband went into the place. The man gave him the wrong order then argued with him he did not give my husband back all his money. The worst experience ever. We will never go back. There food has fell off anyway."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese. Its in Henderson, but its so close to my house. It servers chinese, Thai and Filipino dishes. And its affordable. Very well nicely decorated and the prices are very low. And its their Grand Opening so when this happens, have to try it out and so should you."}
{"text":"We have been to this place and,it has changed a lot!
New owners are very friendly  and helpful the food is amazing we will be back.
We tried the chow fun was yummy, the garlic filipino fried rice was great! Next time will have to try the Tai  menu. Price  is right without  all the fluff,you can't  go wrong,please don't  change  the menu and they will come guaranteed."}
{"text":"Great place, Great food, Nice staff. \"China Inn\" does Chinese right. Like being back at the \"Hong Kong Restaurant\" in Boston. Really good Beef Fried Rice, and the Best Fried Chicken Wings I've had in a long time.

But you have to look for it. By the Smith's, and O'Reilly Auto Parts at 894 S. Boulder Hwy."}
{"text":"Great place for take out, tried a few places around the area for Chinese food and this is by far the best and most consistent. Great food, good size portions, clean and quick."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner -  This is my mom and dad's favorite place for chinese food ...  So I met them here with my nephews. 
We had a nice meal ,  a good meal really - Not the same as Lotus which is where I prefer to go, but it is good.
They start the meal with some fried won ton crisps ... and with sweet and sour. 
I had the broccoli beef and lemon chicken , it came with curry puffs and egg roll and rice , I changed out the egg drop soup for won ton soup.
It was a good change."}
{"text":"I'm usually very picky when it comes to Chinese food but this place definitely met my expectations. Great food & great service. I had the sweetest server ever! I believe her name's Megan. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for local Chinese fair, compared to some of the others around. The Gov Tso's Chicken was okay, I have had better (not locally, so far this was the best I have had in Madison for the price), and I definitely have had worse.  It was crispy chicken. Fried rice was nice, not overly salty and had a good portion of veggies and pork.  The Pepper Steak was decent, too.  Crab rangoons were excellent as well as the pork egg roll and the veggie egg roll. I think its safe to say that I will be ordering from here more often when I have a craving for Chinese delivery.  Oh, and it was delivered in a mere 30 minutes, and still hot."}
{"text":"My familys go-to for good Chinese takeout. I love the egg phu yung and crabragoon here."}
{"text":"We're usually skeptical of dive-looking Chinese restaurants, but this China Inn was awesome. Everything came out really hot, with great flavor. Both the Mongolian beef and general's chicken were tasty! Their combo plate is a great deal- a large portion with fried rice, soup, egg roll and wonton for $8.99. This is our new place for Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice and was satisfied with the large proportions that they serve for the price! Great service, and food!"}
{"text":"Nasty ass kitchen, the owner is rude and dirty as well. Personal experience. No wonder why they close this place."}
{"text":"Where to start... the decor is atrocious, the place just looks like it's going to be bad. The service was mediocre and there was a waitress eating in front of me which I find tacky. The food was ok... just ok... barely ok."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this little hidden gem!!!!! Traditional food with some great twist. The building is a little shabby but they make up for it with great service and flavorful food. Skip the chain stores and try this local small restaurant."}
{"text":"I know I'm harping on the small stuff but I ordered two hot oils on the side. They told me that would be .75 each. No offense but we're talking about a teaspoon of soy sauce with pepper flakes in it which I made myself when the order arrived.

I won't be ordering again.

How about you don't nickel and dime your customers."}
{"text":"Ordered the dinner for two, $9.75. WAY too much food for two people! Won ton soup was great, BBQ spare ribs very flavorful. Loved the foil chicken. The sweet and sour chicken was kinda flavorless, but didn't have a huge breading so added sarachia sauce so an easy fix. Lo-mien was good with lots of meat and onions. Fried rice was also good.
Only complaint was some dishes needed more seasoning, but staff was very friendly and food was well worth the price."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with friends,the eggplant with chicken is yummy ,,,it comes with the white rice ,,,very deliouse....I will definitely come back again ..."}
{"text":"Finally! A delicious Chinese Restaurant! This place has a new owner and cook and it is so yummy with big portions!!"}
{"text":"Used to be very good but seriously sucks now. Food has went way downhill since new owners took over. Nasty overcooked food."}
{"text":"I came here because I read that they had a lunch buffet.  When I inquired about it, I was told that they didn't have it anymore.  So I settled for one of their lunch specials...  I got the sweet and sour chicken.  It was pretty lousy."}
{"text":"We order in from these guys all the time and we love the food and service. We have never had any issue with anything we've ever ordered and the delivery time is reasonable as well. You really get your monies worth. Your wallet and stomach will be full!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese place since it's right up the road. It's simple and mostly carryout (not much of a dining area). We've honestly never had a bad meal here. The food isn't amazing, but it's definitely good! Prices are very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Don't.  Variety is not good. Quality is not good. Weird guy started talking to me and wouldn't leave me alone (a customer). I ate here like fourteen years ago when I used to live by.  Now I have more ambitions for myself. The parking lot is not good. The bathroom is not the best. Service was fine and they have pretty good dumplings. But otherwise not worth coming to over another comparable place."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch at 11:45. It's almost 1 and I have the start of food poisoning. Never again. In case it matters I had pork fried rice and an egg roll. The rest is going in the trash. Miserable."}
{"text":"The only place that reminds me of Chinese food from NY... And I prefer there egg rolls better then then the ones from other places out here... Always get their General Taos and it it always great..."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch day.  We  just moved to the general area and are on the hunt for a Chinese restaurant that we love... we are still searching.  We were there for lunch and tried a couple of the specials.  I had the lemon chicken and my girlfriend had cashew chicken.  The portions were on the smaller side even for a lunch special.  Mine was good but there just wasn't enough of it.  6 pieces of lemon chicken on the plate just left me wanting more.  The cashew chicken had good flavor but was not very appealing to the eye.  The chicken looked like it was boiled.  It came out looking gray, kind or mystery-meatish feel to it.  The best part of the meal was our server.  She was a very sweet older woman whom was very nice and made sure we were well taken care of!  I just don't think we will be returning..."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. We always order takeout and if you choose a combo option, you get soup, egg roll, rangoon, entree, and rice/noodles for super cheap. The girls who take our order every time we go are very nice. Nothing fancy here but always satisfies our cravings for Chinese food."}
{"text":"First visit to China Inn; picked up Dinner. The food was excellent. The order was ready when we arrived and it was still hot by the time we returned home. Fast Friendly service. You need to try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I would of gave a 5 star, but I ordered and waited for an hour and 17 minutes!!!! Honestly, I was expecting bad and bland food, but nope! Everything I got was good, even the damn fortune cookie!
I will definitely still be ordering from this place. I just won't have them deliver because it's ridiculous how long it takes."}
{"text":"Classic carry-out Chinese - friendly staff, generous portions, this restaurant was exactly what I hoped it would be. Will be back!

Just read down the list of reviews here - yikes, guys! This place has an entree that averages like $5. Chill out! If you want a fancier meal, pony up and pay for it at Umami or something. For classic carry-out, China Inn is a great pick, solid food and great people!"}
{"text":"Maybe the blandest and most unappetizing Mom and Pop Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.

I had the displeasure of trying this place once during lunch for work, and once for dinner before a Suns game. Both times they offered cheap combination platters that ran about 7 dollars for an entree, soup, fried rice, and egg roll. Everything from there I would probably rank a step or two below what you even get at a Panda Express.

The Ma po tofu dish I picked last time for dinner was particularly awful and bland. Some cheap store bought tofu lightly fried with some soy sauce. If it wasn't enough, I got somewhat sick off of it too. How do you poison someone with a tofu dish? I guess this place is good at sucking every way possible.

At least its cheap."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. If i didnt have to give it a star, i wouldnt. I got egg flower soup and it was so thick it was like snot. Couldnt eat it. Got the kung pao shrimp lunch special. Tried one bite of the fried rice and had to spit it out. It tasted like a dirty diaper would smell. It was just nasty. The hostess asked how it was and i let her know that there was no way i would be able to eat it. I ended up leaving and will NEVER go back. If youre looking for chinese food, dont go here. I dont know what or how they cook their food but its not worth even trying."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here!  The food at this place is absolutely disgusting!  The soup was so salty and tasted like muddy water.  The rib appetizer wasn't even edible!  It was like it had been made a week earlier.  The foil wrap chicken app was some mysterious pieces of chicken stuffed in foil with salt!  Disgusting!  The sweet & sour pork was seriously like chewing on shoe leather! It had no flavor whatsoever....like it had been boiled to death.  The lo-mein wasn't any better.  It was so salty that you couldn't even eat it!  I hadn't been to this place for about 10 years, due to the last experience I had here.  Made a huge mistake thinking it got better after 10 years.  Not even a little bit better!  Save your money!  Panda Express blows this place away!  And I'm not a big fan of that place either....but at least the food is fresh!  I don't know how China Inn even keeps it's doors open!  Very strange cause there is rarely cars there...hmmm."}
{"text":"I do not know what is happening to China Inn lately, but this is the second time that they messed up our order.  The first time we received one dish entirely different than what was ordered.  This evening, we specifically ordered a combination plate, but received a quart of the order instead.  The combination plate includes an egg roll.  When we called to inform them that the order was wrong the female person on the line proceeded to tell us that we received more of the item because we received the quart size. Really?  We did not want to order the quart size.  We had the order written down, with the number of the item on the menu and also informed them of the name of the dish.  How can you mess that up? To top it off, we were charged slightly highly for the quart size.  We ordered the combination plate purposely for the egg roll.  We are definitely going to find another Chinese restaurant in the area the next time we want to order Chinese food.  I never thought this Chinese restaurant was that great, coming from the Chicago area, but I am looking forward to finding something more authentic in Madison."}
{"text":"We stopped in here one day to get lunch to go. It is really the kind of place you get take out, they have a couple of tables but it's mainly pick up orders. We sampled their spring rolls, vegetable lo mein, broccoli w/ garlic sauce  & Szechuan been curd all of which were delicious. It's just basic Chinese food nothing fancy. Pretty standard menu. They made our food pretty fast too."}
{"text":"Just your standard Chinese take out. I feel this place is better than the other few near it whether it be price or food quality."}
{"text":"We get take out from here probably once a month.  Our orders are always perfect.  I really love the hot and sour soup, and the curry puffs.  We've never eaten in so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"NEW OWNER! NEW COOK! NEW RESTAURANT! Having been to the old China Inn twice and both times vowing to never, ever go back again (not sure how I ended up there on the second visit), I was skeptical when someone told me China Inn was the best Chinese food they'd ever eaten in Henderson. Upon further investigation (cause a claim that ridiculous most certainly warranted an investigation) I discovered that sometime in June the restaurant was sold to a new owner, the menu was overhauled and the cook and staff were replaced. 

I ventured in on Friday night and was pleasantly surprised that there were actually about 5 or 6 cars in the parking lot. This was a good sign as anyone who lives or drives near this place can attest, it normally looks like a ghost town. We walked in and were greeted by the sweetest young girl (that sounds  pervy, totally not my intention) who immediately told us that we could sit wherever we wanted. The decor is pretty much the same as before - cheap and old but someway, somehow it adds to the entire experience. 

I was with 2 other people; 2 of us got the orange chicken dinner special and one the sweet and sour pork dinner special (a real venturesome bunch we are!). The special consists of the usuals-soup (choice of egg drop or hot & spicy), an egg roll, a crab rangoon and rice (white or fried). The food took longer than what we would expect but we chalked it up to being a new restaurant and the fact that there was (surprisingly and awesomely) a pretty full dining room. 

The food itself was really good - nary a complaint in sight. The fried rice was great but I wish it had more veggies in it, although the pieces of barbecued pork were a nice and unexpected addition. The orange chicken and sweet & sour pork were great. The egg roll was decent - the crab rangoon amazing ( of course how could it be anything otherwise? It's crab, cream cheese and fried pastry, people!) Portions were huge - I easily took home half my dinner and ate most of that for lunch the next day. 

The server was attentive and very kind. The orange chicken came out well before the sweet & sour pork and while it otherwise would have been annoying (it was so late coming out that my dinner mate who was waiting for her food insisted that we go ahead and start eating without her) we again chalked it up to the staff being new and not yet having got the hang of things. They were very apologetic and it really wasn't a big deal. 

Bottom line is that this is NOT the old China Inn. It's new in all the right ways and we will definitely be back. Be prepared for a bit of awkward but kind and professional service. Please give this place a try- you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Great Food.  The menu needs updating as it has no pictures of what your getting.  The prices are good.  THE FOOD was GREAT and that is what we went there for after all.  It had only one other couple getting food to go and they talked to us outside as they were not sure if they wanted to eat here as the menu had no pictures and they were not sure.  We talked them into getting some dinner to go but the location had no other customers. It was Friday night so maybe they will have to close if they do not get more customers.  Hard to tell as the economy is hard on everyone right now.  If you have 4 to 6 people they have a great offer on the back page.  The style is like the old China... a older couple cook and serve.  I hope them the best they were kind and gave me the feeling they did care how we felt about everything.  The spicy mustard was great.  The first time I and had it as my friend ordered it.  I will return and hope they do stay open."}
{"text":"This is our go to for take-out. Even our children enjoy the food which is saying a lot for my picky eaters. Great family run business."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times now and it is always delicious!  Our order is always correct, hot, delivered in a timely fashion, and the staff is always super nice.  I would highly recommend this place over any of the other chinese food places in the area (we've tried them all).  If you're from the east coast looking for chinese food like back home, this is as close as you're going to get!"}
{"text":"I grew up here, and visited this place frequently during high school days. That was 20 years ago. And this place was a favorite back then. Came back and tried out for first time in 20 years. Nothing like it used to be. Was there middle of afternoon on a Saturday. Was the only customer in there the whole time. Seemed like the whole staff, along with family members were eating on their lunch time. Anyways to the food. I ordered a lunch special of orange chicken. Came with an egg roll, egg drop soup and fried rice. Soup was decent. Same with the egg roll, nothing out of ordinary. The orange chicken was ok, little watery. Biggest complaint was the fried rice...I think there were 2 green peas in it, with soy sauce...literally that was it. Dont remember any meat, and definitely no scrambled egg. Was really disappointed to see the food quality of one of my fav chinese childhood joints, go so far down hill. 
Maybe was just a bad day for them, not sure. Dont plan on going back anytime in near future . Atmosphere was more reminiscent of a cafe than a chinese restaurant. But, the service was  great, and the young lady who served me had top notch service skills, and was always smiling and starting up small chat with me, and I did like that alot. She was also very cute..asian girl with dyed blonde hair. I have been thinking about returning, just to see her smile again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.
I was very disappointed. 
My lunch was super sweet, just terrible tasting.

My wife ate her's which was a just meat and a little better. They never asked if everything was alright with the food even though I literally took 2 bites. Service was poor and if someone doesn't even get past a couple bites of their food you'd think it'd be common practice to see if it was ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite carry out Chinese food by my house, and there is quite a few. Always hot and delicious! I always get the chicken and broccoli with white rice and fried dumplings (lightly fried)."}
{"text":"It recently opened serving the elusive Chinese lunch buffet in old Henderson.  So good and good price. Went today and its been closed by SNHD.  This has me wondering what the heck happened.  I will decide if I'm going back by what SNHD has in their report. New menu and new owners don't always equal good stuff."}
{"text":"We tried China Inn randomly for delivery and it was decent run of the mill Chinese food- much better than Chang Jiang, which I always find so greasy and has upset my stomach. Delivery time was pretty fast, around 35 minutes. Don't expect a gourmet meal, but if this is what you're in the mood for, it's a safe bet."}
{"text":"Since writing my original review, I have returned several times, and always left a happy customer. The food is great, for what it is. Americanized Chinese takeout. Don't expect anything more, or less. They do what they do very well.
On our last visit my wife phoned in the order and there was a slight miscommunication, once we got there to pick it up, and realized the mistake, they as well as us apologized as it was due to a slight language barrier. They got us what we wanted and on our way very quickly! 
We even left a few dollars tip, which I usually don't do for pick-up service, but the way everything was handled warranted it. 
This is now my go-to for quick Chinese take-out. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review.
General Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.
The lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. 
If I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!

There saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!

I'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week. 

So yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and have tried several chinese places in both the north and south,  and always go back to China Inn in Indian Land!   Best egg rolls,  sesame chicken,  and almost everything.   Place is clean and people are nice.   Prices and portions good.  Service is always fast."}
{"text":"Good food for a great price!! True definition of value. And with food lion next door, I can grab my home needs pretty quick. I love their sesame chicken wings. It's not just a nugget covered in sauce. And their vegetable fried rice is a meal by itself. Today my 5 year old even asked for them by name lol"}
{"text":"The food is good Chinese takeout, but they seem to be consistently inconsistent in getting meals out the door. During busy times they will tell you 20 min and an hour later you might be out the door with your order.  This comes from multiple visits. Looks like only one cook manning the woks so they can't keep up with a dinner rush.   Better to be truthful that they are 60 min or more instead of turning people off by not getting the food as promised.  Too much time wasted waiting here for food. Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Still eating, but this is really disappointing so I'm typing this now. The general tso's IS terrible like the others say. There's just no flavor. The shrimp isn't very good, but not as bad as the chicken. The crab Rangoon is terrible. Incredibly sweet and little flavor. The vegetables are pretty above average as far as Chinesr take out goes. So there's that. Whoever said this is better than Chang Jiang needs to go to a different Chang Jiang because this is far better. Hell, Asian Kitchen is better than this place."}
{"text":"Dirty Dining closed for health violations.  This place was nasty which reflects there dirty food.  Undercooked shrimp fried rice and sweet & sour chicken.  Painted over the old place to cover rotten infested interior won't make the food any better.  If you love dining dirty this is the place for you. Life is way too good to risk and waste time on this place.  Good job NVHD keep an eye on these dirty diners."}
{"text":"I ordered the House Lo Mein dish for my meal (I had to pay a bit extra for the beef to be added since its not included in the dish but thats no biggie for me). The dish turned out pretty good, not greasy, and the proteins were cooked perfectly nothing over done or under cooked, a selling point for me. The sauce was a bit thin and some what lacking in flavor but that didnt affect the dish majorly. Overall my experience was pleasant and I will be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I were getting tired of pizza so we chose to order Chinese. China Inn is close so we decided to try it. My husband ordered sweet and sour chicken with brown rice which was a $1 up charge and did not receive, he got white. I ordered the Seafood Delight- Lobster, shrimp, scallops, and crab meat sauteed with mixed vegetables in white sauce (copy and pasted off of their  online menu). The scallops were not there, the \"crab meat\" was imitation crab meat and very soggy and slimy. If I had known it was imitation crab meat I would never had ordered it, I can't stand the stuff.  We will never order from this place again. The only reason we tried it was because there was flier in our mailbox and thought we would try a new place."}
{"text":"This place is soooo great with food, servers, and the environment of the place is so nice too. (:
I always get their chicken chow fun with egg rolls and oh my goodness! I love it! 
Totally would recommend to EVERYONE"}
{"text":"Run of the mill Americanized Chinese food. Friendly family run joint that pumps out a lightening lunch. They have a tiny lunch buffet if you want to try various menu choices and you can even pay by the pound and take it to go. The General Tso's chicken lunch specual was a bang for the buck and very quickly made ready for carry out. I will be back when in a pinch for time."}
{"text":"China Inn had been a mental bookmark dating back to June 7, 2013 that I recently erased with two dining experiences. I will never forget June 7, 2013 when I attended the Frostbites Unofficial Yelp Event. This was the summer of Frostbites when Yelpers throughout Las Vegas drove to the Frostbites truck at the Smith's anchored shopping center off Boulder Highway in what locals in jest knickname Hendertucky (Henderson). Throughout the event my eyes would wander away from the Frostbites truck toward a cozy looking Chinese restaurant named China Inn. It reminded me of the stand alone Chinese restaurants up in Long Island, NY. After finishing my Frostbites, I went on my Galaxy 3 to check out the Yelp reviews. They were discouraging. This mental bookmark remained for close to three years. 

   Fast forward to nearly three years later and things have changed. The Frostbites truck is long gone. I rarely hear the term Hendertucky. And China Inn is still standing in a new incarnation with new ownership turning it into a top tier Chinese restaurant. Momo B's tips would cause the mental bookmark to open the pages of a new chapter of my Chinese Restaurant dining experiences. 

   My two visits were during the Christmas season at the time of the lunch special which runs to 4 PM. The prices range from $6.99 to $7.99. In similar fashion to the majority of Chinese restaurants, the higher priced lunches are shrimp based. They include soup, fried rice, an egg roll, fortune cookie, and friendly service. For an additional $1 I ordered a pot of tea to compliment the food. And this is the food I ordered. On my first visit, I ordered the lo mein lunch special then on the second the pepper steak. Both times I started the meal off with hot and sour soup. Before the tip each visit came out to around $8. That is less money than Panda Express. 

   China Inn is what Frostbites is to shaved ice: commendable food. The hot and sour soup tasted freshly made and was served nice and hot. I give a thumbs up to the lo mein and pepper steak. The pepper steak was interspersed with the pepper, meat, and onions. The fried rice and egg roll were also thumb up worthy. The slight disappointment was that the hot tea was Lipton. 

   Both times the waitress was welcoming and friendly throughout the meal. She'd check up on me throughout the meal with a smile. 

   China Inn is just as cozy inside as it looks from the outside. This is more of a casual dining environment than takeout. It is a commodious space with the right amount of lighting and seating. During the Christmas and Holidays season, the Christmas tree adds to the cozy ambience of China Inn. 

   The new incarnation of China Inn is a welcoming addition to Boulder Highway in Henderson. The lunch special really is a spectacular deal when you take into consideration that it is parallel priced to fast food restaurants. The quality of the food is at the upper tier. The service and environment is friendly. I give China Inn my four star stamp of approval."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap, Americanized Chinese food this is it.  Tasty and quick.  Can't go wrong.  I recommend Szechuan Bean Curd with fried rice."}
{"text":"Anyone who orders from here is too lazy to get on yelp and look for a better place. Normally I think crappy Chinese food is good. This is below my standards..yuck"}
{"text":"This is standard Chinese fare which is to say low quality substandard food. It gets three stars because it was exactly what I expected: corn starch, food coloring and battered batter(little chicken.) why do I do this to myself? I don't know. China Inn is gross - like every Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.

Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon."}
{"text":"Broad selection of Thai, Filipino and Chinese foods.
Fast and delicious!
Interior looks nicely decorated, cannot comment on table service since I have only done takeout 

Pros:
Price is right.
Large portions of good food.
$4 meal maker adds enough food to feed another couple people
Plenty of vegetables in their vegetable dishes
Friendly staff

Cons:
MSG, if you don't want it tell them. I asked because the no MSG sign was crossed off manually on all the menus and I figured they must have gotten a batch of soy sauce with MSG, but no, they add it)
pad thai was a little dry."}
{"text":"This place just reopened a few months ago following a long-overdue remodel. It's a good place, no questions asked. Not the best Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten in, but a worthy one nonetheless.

As far as atmosphere goes, the interior here is a bit more \"casual\" than most Chinese restaurants. Most of this interior decor feels more like something that belongs at Denny's or IHOP. Fortunately, there isn't a whole lot of excess noise either. During my last visit, a TV behind the counter was showing Seinfeld - not complaining or anything, but if you want an authentic Chinese experience, atmosphere and all, this isn't the place for you.

But the food is what counts, and each time I have been here, I have had no complaints with it. They have a large, diverse menu - quite possibly one of the largest of its kind. Regardless of your tastes in Chinese food, I'm sure you'll find something you like here. 

China Inn doesn't really do anything to stand out amongst the other Chinese restaurants in town, but with food items this solid I could care less. Definitely worth stopping by if you're a fan of Chinese food and are in the \"Old Henderson\" area."}
{"text":"China Inn seems to have improved since I last reviewed. We used Grub Hub to order, which is a pretty good bet if you want it fast without getting hung up on. 

They have also expanded their menu--sesame tofu, General Tso's tofu, etc. We ordered the Bean Curd with garlic and it was fresh and flavorful, lots of fresh veggies. It was not hot as advertised, but more subtly sweet.  

I am pretty pleased with their progress. They even offer edamame and I hope to try the cold sesame noodles soon."}
{"text":"This place has a big turn around from the old owners. I tried it and created a monster as family wants egg foo young all the time now.
 Really great food, comfortable seating. Quick service and friendly staff. It is fairly cheap for the most part. Check out the lunch specials and make up your own mind."}
{"text":"This place food reminds me of the Chinese food back in New York.  So every time I have a taste for Chinese I come here.   But lately the owner son is there and he has no customer service skills.  And he is the reason why I won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"We visited this establishment under the old ownership and was very disappointed.  The new owners are working hard to please their clients and we will be going back.  The food is not as good as you can get in China Town, but is definintely an upgrade from before.  Tables were spotless, the service was good and the food was served in a respectable time.

I just made my second visit to this establishment.  This time I was flying solo, no family along.  Sometimes the service is slower in other restaurants for some reason.  I already knew what I wanted and gave my order to the hostess as I was being seated.  In 10-minutes I was being served great lettuce wraps, and Kung Po Chicken.  We usually have a weekly restaurant rotation and this one I am keeping even if the fam is wanting something besides Asian."}
{"text":"Holy crap this food is bad. 

I'll not give it one star because the people are friendly, the menu is inexpensive, and they serve combonation plates during dinner times. Most of the time it is hard for me to get Chinese because everything is a la carte after lunchtime, and when you are dining alone, that sucks. 

They close at 8PM nightly, and don't have much foot traffic after about 4pm. The food sucks and it seems like everyone knows it."}
{"text":"There is no way this place is a 4 star restaurant.... We came in at dinner 5pm.... Ordered the Pepper Steak meal and I had the General Tso chicken meal. By the way, despite the 6 cars in the parking lot, there was only one other couple in the place. Anyways, the egg drop soup was good. But that's it. The crab Rangoon was beyond fishy, and then they had these fried balls that I cut open and didn't know what it was so I didn't eat it. The egg roll was similar to the ones you get at the mall. The fried rice had some kind of meat in it and every bite had something hard in it. The meat was sloppy with sauce. The general chicken was literally fried skin and no meat. We took 2 bites of our food and asked for the check. 40 bucks down the drain. Please don't waste your money on this place!"}
{"text":"I get takeout from China Inn a couple times a month on average. So far everything I've had has been pretty good.

I'm a big fan of their Mongolian Beef.  The beef and chicken fried rice is good as well. The only complaint I have is sometimes the Mongolian beef is more onions than beef. Maybe that's because I go there later in the evening shortly before closing time and I get what's left of the beef.

I don't eat in, but I can describe the restaurant decor as your typical tacky Chinese restaurant decorations like the ceramic Fat Buddhas and ceramic lucky cats on the counters. The dining room is pretty much the same- Chinese fans on the wall, etc.

I'd visit China Inn more often if the prices were a bit lower. Combo meals like the Mongolian beef with an eggroll, cream cheese wontons, and fried rice for one runs $10 with no drink. A bit pricey compared to something like Panda Express."}
{"text":"Tasteless wonton soup in which the wontons were not cooked correctly(hard),  and it was way too hot. Ouch! 
The girl at the counter had them remake the soup, but it was still tasteless, so I tasted and left it on the table. Rice was good, not sticky or too greasy. Egg roll was of the pre packaged variety and was unremarkable to  that kind of product.
I got the terriaki  chicken sticks that were unlike any id ever experienced in a negative way. Yellowish  in color, not sure how they were seasoned, but they are overcooked and had a mystery about them.
Cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Used to be great food,everything is bland now,taste has gone down hill fast,inside restaurant old and and in appealing,tried take out,messed that up had coupon for free gen Tao chicken,charged me anyway"}
{"text":"The lomain here is superb!!!! The rest of the food was okay, the staff was very friendly and on top of it. The atmosphere in the restarting isn't all that great it's really divey but overall it was good and a little big proved for dinner will have to come for lunch time special"}
{"text":"I have been getting carry out from the China Inn for over twenty years. It has always been my go to place for Chinese carry out. Went last week to pick up some fried rice and was devestated to see a sign announcing that they were now CLOSED. Place just reopened under new owners. Haven't been able to give it a try yet."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here, definitely would recommend this place to eat remind. I only go to this spot because they have great shrimp egg foo young and shrimp and broccoli the best in Charlotte hands down"}
{"text":"Do not request Thai food to be made by the staff here because they are Chinese (even though they offer it on the menu). The lettuce (not cabbage mind you) was probably 3 inches in diameter and wilted brown. All three of the limes that were given when squeezed had absolutely no juice in them. The chicken was only chopped up and was not ground into a fine texture and mixed with rice powder like it should have been.  Very nice service here as for their food, I will only come back to see if their Chinese food is good. I'm scared to see how they will cook the Filipino food on their menu!!"}
{"text":"Lemme tell ya something.  Just because a Chinese restaurant has Mapo Tofu on the menu, doesn't mean they actually HAVE Mapo Tofu.  Yuck.  After having it at Ichiban Sichuan, and making it at home, I truly do not know what I just had.  It was NOT Mapo Tofu.  Maybe that's why I only had three bites.
The hot & sour soup is, however very good, and my husband likes their Singapore Mei Fun.
Awesome delivery time.  Quoted 30 minutes, was here in 10."}
