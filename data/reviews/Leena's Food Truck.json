{"text":"Love that they are keeping Leenas going.  Oakland misses it.  Got a gyro platter and it was great.  Two pitas, gyro and fries mixed, salad, and tahini.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"The best falafel and hummus in Pittsburgh. Perfect seasoning and crispy falafel that crumbles in your mouth.  I can't get enough of those loaded fries they have on the menu.  #1 palestinian food.  Price is perfect too!!"}
{"text":"Got to try them at the Pittsburgh VegFest 2016 today. I had the 
Veggie Pita wrap- hummus, salad, garlic pickles, onions, hot peppers. It was nom noms, next time asking for more peppers I like it spicy!"}
{"text":"Their food truck was parked in front of soldiers and sailors for election day. They were giving out any of their wraps and a side. I ordered the gyro with hot peppers and the side of hummus. I was so thankful that despite it being free, they gave the normal amount. 

The hummus side was a decent sized container of fresh hummus and olive oil with a warmed pita. The hummus was a nice change from all the processed hummus I am used to. Then, the gyro came out and I could not wait to dive in. The gyro was perfect in every way! There was copious amounts of juicy meat. There also was enough sauce that I got the creamy cucumber sauce in every bite. I think why I enjoyed this gyro more than the usual was that it was on a thin pita not a fat thick pita bread. It was also wrapped well and did not fall apart while I was eating. 

Would totally come back to have a gyro from them!"}
{"text":"So this food truck is a spin off of the amazing restaurant we knew and loved in Oakland. I am giving low star ratings because the food while still good just hasn't been the sensational experience I have enjoyed other times. Also, they were at a food truck round up that ran from 2-10 pm and they ran out of food. I don't mean just a couple of things but nearly everything on their menu! How are you not prepared for such an event? Super nice girls and usually spectacular food don't excuse the lack of being prepared for something that is literally their bread and butter."}
