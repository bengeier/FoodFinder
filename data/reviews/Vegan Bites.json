{"text":"For someone who's lactose intolerant and recently diagnosed to be gluten sensitive my goal is to list all my new favorite food joints ...I'm super excited to find this gem tucked in the Collindale theatre square in Henderson (off 215/Eastern). Friendly encounter with owner Frank he took his time to introduce all the items... 1) they use all organic and while some places use corn flour and misc others I'm allergic to ..they stick to Oat flour and organic coconut sugar  2) those GF items are on the green shelves  3) still tons of selections on GF sections - I can't wait try their whole cakes 4) I had key lime cheesecake..oh so yummy, it's vegan so it's creatively crafted with different ingredients to taste and feel like cheesecake - success  5) they also do coffee and smoothies to come soon .. See my other pictures ..I'm gonna pig out here LOL"}
{"text":"I ordered an Oreo cake. I called same day so I wasn't able to get any customizations however the cake was delicious. My family couldn't tell the difference. I also got a slice of cheese cake for the road and it is bomb!!"}
{"text":"I vegan bites..  Even, I'm a paleo eater..  Perfect place for me to go and get some sweets.."}
{"text":"Awesome little vegan bakery shop! I had the walnut brownies OMG sooooo moist and chewy and the almond truffle, which was chocolate x10 sooo good! Highly reccommend,  lets support the little guys!! :)"}
{"text":"went into the store and was greeted kindly by the owner. Came here at 6:00 and at first i thought it was closed but ti turns out that they were open from 10;00 to 8:00. so don't be fooled by the sign on the door. Everything looked good, bought a vanilla caramel cupcake, the red velvet cupcake, and the chocolate cupcake. We also bought a chocolate cake pop with coconut sprinkles on the bottom. The cupcakes were dense, however they were very flavorful. I enjoyed the rich dark chocolate flavor in the chocolate frosting of the cake pop and cupcake It was so delicious and i highly recommend it for dark chocolate lovers. The vanilla caramel cupcake was also very good, i enjoyed the vanilla frosting and caramel drizzle on top, the cupcake wasn't very sweet, but the frosting was so it balanced out. I was also surprised to find a nice caramel filling in the cupcake. And the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake, OMG! i loved these cupcakes, i know i will buy a birthday cake from this store in the future when it's my birthday.I can't wait to visit this bakery again.    If you are around the area you should definitely check it out, may be a little pricey but remember no animals are being harmed, it's all plant based, gluten free, no refined sugar, peanut free, and 100% delicious."}
{"text":"After a movie, we discovered your cute cafe at the end of the sidewalk. I had a mocha latte with almond milk (awesome!!) and we left with several slices of carrot cake. Not every slice made it home!!! Thank you for the quick reply to my message - and the gal at the front was very polite and friendly. Amazing prices for healthy food options!  Wish I could grab a coffee there every morning. Any plans for a drive-thru?  Highly recommend the carrot cake. Perfect spice level and the icing is super smooth."}
{"text":"Lemon blueberry cake was good, moist and with real blueberries not just blueberry flavor.  However it's a really small store with no tables to sit and enjoy the food.  There are 2 benches outside, but thats not really an option if you want to have a conversation with a friend.  Would have ordered coffee but the coffee creamers are definately NOT vegan, why not have a carton of soy or coconut creamer available?"}
{"text":"I Found this place while searching for vegan treats on Yelp. The staff was very friendly. I Loved the  vegan gluten free brownies and German chocolate cake."}
{"text":"On rare occasion since going vegan I will ear a dessert since I don't crave sugar much these days. I will drive across town to pick up some treats. I eat one treat and the rest I give away or put in the freezer.  clean organic treats :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, everything is so moist, yummy and anything they make can also be ordered gluten free. Thank you and Yahushua (Jesus) loves you!"}
{"text":"I've been here three or four times and they're vegan blueberry cake is wonderful! I tried a gluten-free brownie and next time I will try a vegan brownie. The organic coffee was really good and it all proved to be a great treat for the movies (which is next door)!"}
{"text":"The brownie and vanilla cupcake were delicious!! I also love the Orange Cinnamon Date Bites they sell that are all packaged up, they are great for when I go on my runs."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have good food and stuff! I recommend that you consume products from this establishment because my opinion matters! I bought a carrot cake cupcake that was amazing! I also bought a banana nut loaf that was pretty good, and some gluten free chocolate chip cookies that were mediocre. I think the problem with the gluten free cookies was the gluten free part. They didn't have an option to not get gluten free cookies so I had no choice. I would eat the cupcake and the loaf again. I will pass on the chocolate chip cookies though."}
{"text":"My mom loved her GF Vegan mother's day bouquet delivered to her work for FREE on Mother's Day :) It really made her day and she said everything tasted AMAZING. She sent me a picture and it looked exactly how they said it would even with all my necessary substitutions to accommodate her diet. She is gluten free and vegan not by choice,  but due to many health problems. So seeing her happy and enjoying some treats is just great. Thank you so much, Veganbites."}
{"text":"Prior to the opening I had the pleasure of trying their chocolate cake, which I must say was amazing. The cake itself was a perfect balance for a rich frosting. After enjoying the cake I was looking forward to the opening and was not disappointed. The cookies and banana-chocolate bread were both great. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This cute little bakery is an absolute gem. They offer an assortment of vegan treats with some gluten free options. I had stopped by to pick up a dessert for an event, and decided on a carrot cake. It was phenomenal! Nathalie and this other gentleman were extremely sweet and welcoming. If you're craving a delightful treat served with a smile I highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! I've basically tried everything here so far and the almond cake pops are by far my favorite.."}
{"text":"They had quite the assortment of goodies when I went a couple of weeks ago. After much deliberation I decided to get the gluten-free, vegan carrot cake and it did not disappoint--it was so delicious! My dad(who isn't vegan) got it and loved it, as well! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came from Phoenix to Vegas for the grand opening and I was not disappointed!! Vegan, no refined sugar, gluten free.. I could go on and on about how out of the norm and awesome this place is. I have been vegan for several months now and have struggled to find snacks for my busy day to day, but I've officially found lots of delicious options! My favorite would have to be the garlic seed crackers, YUM. But everything is delicious here. Cupcakes, cake pops, chocolates, breads, granola, etc. The owner Doreen is very involved and you can tell she is very passionate about what she does. Very helpful and accommodating. If you are vegan, gluten free, or just looking for a healthy alternative in the Vegas area, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Veganbites for 3 months and and I LOVED it. ( I go once a week)  3 weeks ago I went in to get some Carmel Corn and they were out of the regular white paper bags it usually comes in. So I got it in the plastic bag , but noticed the amount was a tad bit smaller.  2 week ago I went in and noticed the same thing , there was a little less .  This week my husband went in and came home with my pop corn .. OMG the bag was SO SMALL it would of covered just the bottom of the white bag and FOR the. SAME PRICE and even worse it tasted STALE.  I was also disppointed because the ONLY cookies I like are the oatmeal ones and for 3 weeks they have been out.  We spend quite a bit of money in there for vegan treats , because I am vegam and picky what I eat.  But if this is how it is going to be there , I will be finding another place to go.   I tried to call and talk to them , (becauae I don't want to be one of those people bitching about stuff online),  But no one answered the phone ."}
{"text":"So I recently had to change my diet due to some thyroid issues. My doctor highly recommended that I eliminate dairy and gluten from my diet.  At first it was extremely difficult but it got easier as time went on and I found this place!  They have the most delicious gluten-free vegan desserts.  Carrot cake, German chocolate cake, double chocolate cookies, and coconut ganache are just a few of the fresh mouth watering treats that they carry.  I would highly recommend this place to everybody but even more so to vegans and people with a gluten/dairy sensitivity."}
{"text":"Fell upon this place and so happy I landed there!! I have been back several times for their pumpkin spice and blueberry lemon loaves for the quick bite out the door on a workday morning and I now have a bag of their granola or trail mix in the car for the hungry, stress headache and the drive home. If they had a cafe for me to park with my laptop, I would be writing this from there!!! With a son who is a diabetic and for me who said a tearful goodbye to dairy and refined sugars, I have found a safe zone to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"This place is proof that vegan desserts are amazing !  The carrot cake was so incredibly moist and the icing was delicious - not too sweet. I also picked up a carton of vanilla cream cookies that I scarfed down driving back to home to CA. It's a shame I couldn't sample more from this vegan bakery but I'll be sure to go back for more when I head out to Vegas in the future.  Very clean, tons of parking, and excellent customer service from the employees. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"OK, so yes, I was an hour early picking up a birthday cake that I ordered 3 days prior. No, it was not ready, and no, I didn't want to wait.  Thankfully they had the same cake already made and just had to personalize it.  They even adding some extra icing that I requested!  Now...let's get to the taste.  First off, I AM NOT A VEGAN.  My wife is, and it was her birthday, so i wanted to get something special.  I could not stop eating this cake!  It was so fricken' delicious, and I would have never guessed it was vegan.  Moist, chocolaty, coconutty, yummy....now I want more!  The pictures don't give it justice, but let me tell you...after trying the German Chocolate Cake, I can't wait to try the Oreo cake that was steering at me the whole time!"}
{"text":"So amazing! Usually when treats are vegan or gluten free they sacrifice on taste, but vegan bites are scrumptious!"}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas I saw this place had a Groupon deal. Given I'm eating vegan but still wanted to feel indulgent in Vegas I thought I'd give it a try. It is fantastic! Really nice people working there. The yummies are so good even non vegans will be happy with the treats.   The prices were on par with most bakeries which was surprising given most specialty places charge more. But not this place. They also had a few GF options. Definitely suggest giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I have been here several times to satisfy my rare sweet tooth. Across town I'm not here as often as I would like (even though my waistline thanks me) but when I get here I'm always excited to try something new.  I have tried the GF brownies, about four kinds of cake pops, those yummy for my tummy double chocolate cookies, chocolate dipped strawberries, chocolate dipped cherries, and cupcakes.  This month for hubbies bday my parents who live in Indiana (and snowbird Florida) surprised him with a huge fabulous edible arrangement from here! I didn't even know they did such and thing and how did my mom find them?!?! She is a support local business queen so I'm not surprised. I sent her pics right away and she was very impressed with the order!!!!! The delivery guy was super nice at our door too!   Please check out my pics of the beauty, hubby had a heyday with all his chocolate love!!!!!! I highly suggest a decadent delivery."}
{"text":"This place is mouthwatering! Usually vegan bakery items don't taste as well as regular bakery items, but Vegan Bites is an exception. I came to Vegan Bites because I was going to a dinner and one of my friends is completely allergic to dairy. I decided to give this vegan bakery a shot and I wasn't disappointed.   Recommendation: Buy the coupon which is $15 for $25 worth of items.   With the coupon, I was able to buy a dozen of truffles and 8 of the mini cupcakes. All of the items were decorated so beautifully, especially the cupcakes! They had many bakery items from cake pops to baklava. Vegan Bites is very accommodating, not only do they have vegan items but they also have a large range of gluten free items!   Truffles: 5/5  I got a dozen truffles for $11.99 and I got a various combination of Coconut, Cacao, and Oreo. Each truffle is made with coconut oil and other natural ingredients, but it still manages to taste like a normal truffle. My favorite was the Oreo! You can taste a little bit of the coconut oil, but it's still delicious!  Cookies: 3/5 Although the cookies looked delicious and were only $1, I didn't really care for the taste. They were okay, but I've definitely tasted better vegan cookies.   Cupcakes: N/A I did buy the mini cupcakes the dinner I was going to, but I didn't get to try any. The cupcakes were $11.99 for 8 mini cupcakes and they were meticulously decorated. They have many flavors including red velvet, carrot cake, cinnamon, chocolate, and vanilla.   Staff: 5/5  I wasn't really sure what to get because there are so many options! But the staff was very helpful with suggesting popular items and the best flavors."}
{"text":"I just found out I am allergic to milk and eggs. As I deal with the change in lifestyle I am searching for options.  I am so happy I found Veganbites! I totally recommend this place for everybody; there is no change in flavor from what I was used . And these are absolutely more healthy dessert options."}
{"text":"Had the strawberry cheesecake and its delicious! I had my wedding cake done by them and it was yummy. Great quality and no one could tell it was vegan. This place is great."}
{"text":"When I first read about this place I was really excited to be trying out a bakery that touted itself on being vegan. I have tried some store bought products in the past that were pretty good (cookies and such) and was hoping this bakery would give me a pleasant experience with more options. It did.   I decided to try the oatmeal pecan cookie, coconut truffle, and the almond truffle.   The  cookie was huge, moist and delicious. I asked the lady what was in it and she said pecans and oatmeal. However, she neglected to mention the golden raisins. I like raisins but admittedly there were too many for my taste. I ended up picking half of them out. In total I had about 30 raisins and maybe 1 whole pecan. My suggestion is they add a few more pecans.  I still enjoyed the cookie and if you like raisins you will too!  Now for the truffles, they were awesome. 5 out of 5 stars. They were moist and super fudgy. A definite must try item!"}
{"text":"Great customer service with amazing desserts. I have enjoyed everything I got here. My favorite is the pumpkin loaf! The perfect amount of sweetness, not too sweet."}
{"text":"Cinnamon burst cupcake. OMG. Literally the best cupcake I have ever had. Not to mention it was vegan and gluten-free!!! The employees there were warm and helpful. My husband and I had a lot of questions about what they had to offer and they were patient with everything. I walked out with an amazing cake pop covered in crushed almonds and the cinnamon burst cupcake. I actually think I'm going back today because it was so good."}
{"text":"We ordered gluten free vanilla and chocolate cupcakes with vanilla buttercream for our wedding reception and they were amazing! We also had a small two tier vanilla cake with strawberries inside and that was even better!  Everyone loved everything even though they're used to eating junk food. I was so happy to find an organic, vegan, gluten free bakery to cater our event. They were helpful throughout the process, the price was great and we were able to sample whatever we wanted to before we decided to move forward. I would definitely visit them again whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I recently started vegan about a week ago.. I was craving for sweets.. I came across veganbites and decided to check it out.. I asked for sample just to try.. Because i've never had vegan pastries before.. They gave me the chocolate cupcake ... Organic- gluten free. And i must say.... It was HEAVEN!!!! BEST chocolate cupcake i've ever tasted in my life!!! They also let me try the chocolate cookie! I thought it would taste weird or there might be an after taste.. But it was not!!! I highly recommend this place and i would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Recently i was diagnosed with Hashimoto syndrome. So I need to stop soy, dairy and gluten. Not by choice, believe me! So i was looking for a chocolate fix to save my life!  I had a vegan brownie! My first vegan brownie that didn't taste sad! Really good! The truffle was excellent ! And the date bites were soo good. The girl that helped is was so friendly and helpful! She was great!  I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Just WOW!! I am soooo amazingly surprised of how delicious everything I tried was!! Seriously when they say you can't even tell that it's vegan they weren't lying! This is definitely going to be my go to for any sweet cravings I have. Might even order my daughters birthday cake from here...shh the kids won't know it's vegan! Yay!   What I tried: Variety of 4 mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla, lemon and red velvet Baklava Truffles: Oreo, almond and coconut Mini Cookies: double chocolate and oatmeal raisin Oreo cake  All were so very delicious!! The Oreo cake was my least favorite"}
{"text":"Ordered a 6\" round chocolate cake with buttercream frosting. All vegan. First time having vegan cake and it was delightful!  Moist, fluffy, you would never know it's vegan. Whole party enjoyed the cake vegan and non vegans. Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a friends birthday and she does not eat eggs so I looked up Yelp and ordered an Vegan chocolate cake for her. I was fast asleep (yes, partying happened the night before) when they called to deliver the cake. The owners who were delivering the cake were on their way back to the store when I called. However, they were very accomodating and patiently headed back to us. The cake by the way was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best & only vegan bakery in town. Is a little far from our house but worth the drive. We gone there a couple times, we gotten cupcakes, a cake, brownies & cakepops. You also get a free dozen cookies with every $50 you spend."}
{"text":"Picked up a cake for my partner's birthday, which was eh. Nothing like my expectations. I was excited to try something as a vegan, but the cake was a miss. We got the chocolate cake with cherry filling. Wouldn't order it again, but maybe i'll try something another time. Service was horrible though. The lady who helped us was rude and just awkward, so that sucked especially for a first time visit."}
{"text":"This will be my go to sweet tooth place! Don't be biased and not give it a try because its vegan, try it out!"}
{"text":"My wife ordered a vegan carrot cake for my birthday... Needless to say it was amazing. This decadent cake was priced really well and really blew me away in terms of texture and taste. Made with great wholesome ingredients and enjoyed by my entire family. Thanks a lot we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. I ordered a cake for my daughter's 7th bday. Through a miscommunication it was made chocolate instead of strawberry shortcake. I e-mailed them right away and they made me a 2nd, smaller cake to make up for their mistake. Bravo! The bakers and staff are super nice and when i called to pick up the replacement cake they finished it for me to pick up that day even though through another mix up it wasnt scheduled to be picked up til the next day.  A few missteps but overall still great service. Plus the flavor??!!?! Both cakes were fabulous. If u want a tasty cake that everyone will remember then try vegan bites. They are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe mid-week is not the time to go. Although service was friendly, stock seemed limited: mostly cupcakes and (dry-looking) cookies during my visit, with only a single flavor cake pop available. I've had some incredible vegan desserts in my time, would consider their protein bars on a future visit.  Quality is fair, but only a place I'd recommend if your diet requires you to see out vegan or gluten-free options. Cake pop was rolled in granola, which was fun... but outer layer was hard to bite through, and interior flavor was incredibly moist, but in that dense, straight-chocolate way that I associate more with a fudge than a cake.  Bonus points for offering a Yelp deal; $15 for $30! Some of the prices are a bit steep, which is to be expected for a specialty bake shop: cupcakes and cake pops both just under $4, mini-cookies 75cents/each.   I also appreciate that coffee is available, saving me an additional stop. Note that they offer brownie edges by the register, for all you freaks who don't understand that the middle, gooey center is the best part!"}
{"text":"Small bakery with offerings in vegan and gluten free! Using only the best ingredients and making them decadent! Our first trip we had the giant brownie (v&gf) red velvet cupcakes (v&gf) blueberry lemon loaf(v&gf) everything was fabulous! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place.   I found them last year, around this time, while searching for a birthday cake that my co-worker could eat and enjoy without fear of bodily retaliation. I was excited to find VeganBites - allergy-free, vegan, gluten-free, AND organic. I ordered a 10\" round double layer chocolate cake and requested it be gluten-free..   The cake was a hit in the office. Even a couple co-workers who, to that point, made every effort to avoid and discredit the taste and validity of anything gluten-free or vegan, devoured their slices. You can taste the quality of ingredients, too. I knew then that, at the very least, I'd be back again for my coworker's next birthday.   Fast forward to now and custom birthday cake for the co-worker #2...  Remembering her love of peanut butter cups, I sent an email inquiring whether or not a \"PB cup\"-inspired cake was possible. I forgot that peanuts are not allergy-friendly. However, the team offered an almond butter alternative. They took the time to outline options and provide feedback that would get as close as possible to the end goal. At the end of the day, my co-worker chose the oreo crumble flavor from the regular menu. I placed the order online and included a note that someone else from the office would pick up the cake. Everything was so easy. I can't say enough how much I appreciated the team's responsiveness, patience, and willingness to help.   As expected, this year's cake - this time, with gluten - was again a hit.   My only complaint is that I live on the other side of town. But that's a ME problem. YOU? You should pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"In every town i want to find great Vegan food. And in Henderson i found VeganBites! Its amazing!  100% Vegan and so delicious! chocolate chip cookies is my favorite! And price is very good!  Also one time i bought cake for my best friend birthday party! It was HUGE"}
{"text":"Great new vegan bakery!! They have amazing desserts - such a good feeling knowing I can literally eat everything they offer!!  I will absolutely be back and recommend to friends - vegan or not"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now.. The first time I got a few coconut balls and cookies. All of the items seemed good quality, but they tasted days old. Nothing was fresh, cookies were hard in that old sat -out-too long kind of way. The second time we got a half dozen cupcakes and a lemon Berry loaf. Actually my BF got these items and the cupcakes were for my bday . I'm a HUGE fan of vegan cupcakes so imagine my excitement!  The loaf wasn't  good, and as for the cupcakes -half were delicious  and the other half were kind of hard/old tasting. Frosting was a bit gritty. Not amazing by any means. And I know an amazing cupcake when I eat one!  I'm also a member of a Vegan page on FB and reviews on there all say this place is hit or miss.  Just stick w whole foods for vegan desserts where you know the quality is always good. But if you want a strictly vegan bakery then try this place."}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't know vegan and gluten free cookies could be so good!  Glad we stopped in this local bakery to grab some dessert to take to a friends place.  Loved the selection and prices were reasonable.  We decided to try the yo-yo's which is cream between 2 cookies and a topping.  We tried 4 different ones which we all shared.  They were good, but I personally would have been more than happy just having the cookies as the cream was a little sweet for me.  However, 5 stars all the way because the cookies were soft, moist, delicious and you would never know they are both vegan and gluten free.  Thank goodness I don't live in the area otherwise, i'd be here more often than I should.  But, when I am in Vegas I just may stop in for a sweet fix."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  There is an abundance of choices, the products are fantastic and the employees are outstanding.   I recommend Veganbites to everyone.  Tom Waters"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pastries and desserts I have  ever had in my whole life! I don't know how they do it, but they have perfected it."}
{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake and it was too dry and hard as a rock!!  Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"really great sweets place! everything is vegan and they have some gluten free items too!  they don't used any refined sugar so that's a plus.  i got some brownies and cookies when i came here the first time and it tasted like i was eating a regular brownie... just with better ingredients!  i definitely recommend!! i can't wait to go back, it's right down the street from my house too :)"}
{"text":"Wow!!! It's gluten free?? Are you sure???  This place fills a niche for the area with its large selection of vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and peanut -free bakery and snack products. The service is outstanding as the counter help is  super knowledgeable, patient, and friendly. I really tasted the quality in the bakery (brownies, cookies, cakes) and bagged snacks (cocoa covered dates, granola) I have tried. Veganbites totally rocks the house!"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing!  We used it for every special occasion our family had. The manager was delightful. They knew my son by name and knew his allergies. They would always greet anyone who walked in with a smile but since the ownership has changed they are rude, like you are disturbing them to place an order. They never know what they have or how to make it. I have been given the wrong item several times. The pastries are nasty, it's like eating solid dough bricks. There is no heart to this business anymore.  Sad that the new owner doesnt take more pride in this store or the employees. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I was very excited about trying Veganbites as they have received rave reviews. I purchased a bag of the date bites, one vanilla cupcake and carrot cupcake.  Everything was yummy, but instead of giving me a vanilla cupcake I received a pumpkin one instead.  A little late to call or bring it back as I didn't return home until 9:00 p.m.  So I was a bit disappointed about that, not much of a pumpkin fan and it was a little on the dry side."}
{"text":"Everything I've had so far was really delicious! My faves are the Oreo truffles and the walnut brownies! I'm not vegan but I will definitely be coming back and I'd like to also try their macarons. Franz was the one at the counter when I stopped by yesterday. He was awesome! He provided excellent customer service! A very satisfied customer here :)"}
{"text":"The name is misleading. I wasn't expecting really good baked treats, but that is exactly what they offer.  I had a sample of their four truffle offerings. Not too sweet, high quality slightly bitter dark chocolate, creamy & delicious. Perfect. My wife had a slice of their key lime pie. I'm not a fan, but I would come back just for this! It's was that good. Again, sweet but not too sweet. Tangy but not too much, and a crisp - not soggy- graham cracker crust."}
{"text":"2 stars removed, because cheesecakes were frozen Daiya straight from the box.  Cupcakes were pretty good, except no vanilla cupcakes were available in the variety 4pack, only orange, which had a yummy cake but frosting tasted like orange EmergenC vitamin packets. Strawberry & chocolate ones were great, and the red velvet could be better.  Cookie was really really sweet."}
{"text":"They have variety of baked good and wholesale! We got a lot of cookies and a pumpkin loaf!!! All vegan !! My favorite was the plain chocolate chip, coconut chip and the pumpkin loaf!! Omg so delicious I even gave it to my non vegan family and they devour them without hesitation"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and they have not disappointed. I've bought the Oreo chocolate cake and it's delicious. Even my mom vegan family liked it. Definitely recommend this bakery."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would . I ordered an customized Carrot cake for my mother birthday. Very simple all the cake had to say was Happy birthday Mom!  With dogs decorations meaning where their was open space on the cake surface. I later received a call from a lady saying she couldn't do the dog decorations on the cake . Simple she couldn't do it and it would cost an extra $10 to add an graphic design .  If you can't do it then that's totally fine but I'm more disappointed in the customer service she came out very rude and unresponsive on the phone (long awkward silent pauses) when ask why she couldn't do it and what other options there was besides an extra $10 charge . I didn't receive no apologies either. It doesn't make sense to me that a 9 inch cake can't not support words saying happy birthday and other decorations . She could have at least reasoned with me and did one decoration of a paw print where their was open space available on the cake surface . Furthermore, being a vegan options are some what limited in food places and I love supporting any local vegan places out there but if customer service is lacking, it's not worth going to .  I doubt if management reads this review they will not coach to this lady or probability defend her actions with excuses. Save your money and time when ordering customized cake here."}
{"text":"Update: We went back in search of the chocolate bread. They had it. My boyfriend couldn't contain his excitement and indirectly made it very clear that we were the ones from this review. Embarrassing and awkward. The owner was nice. They had already messaged me offering free bread, but I'm not looking for handouts (nice of them though). They insisted that we take the rest of the loaf that they had (about half a loaf) whilst only paying for 1 or 2 pieces. We tried to refuse and failed. The owner explained that this bread is difficult to get right as it is gluten free and chocolate and apparently those two characteristics don't play well together. Overall, a pleasant experience. I've been going to Vegan Bites for a long time and I must admit, we stopped going for awhile as the quality deteriorated (I believe this was under previous owners but I'm not certain). As of recently, the quality has definitely improved and there are lots of new items available. We tried the apple streusel as well. It was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I purchased 2 bday cakes here and they both tasted amazing my goodness...I will be getting all my bday cakes here from now on."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Vegan dessert palace.  The place is simple, the staff is friendly, and the food is exquisite.  We ordered a Vegan Cake in a Forrest theme. With vegan cupcakes adorning it.  All different flavors, all Vegan and all delicious! Please visit this great bakery."}
{"text":"Omg! I just had the best chocolate chip cookie of my life! And it's vegan, organic, no refined sugars! Is this place for real???  I'm in love!  I bought a cake from them and will review that later. Hoping it will taste as good as the cookie."}
{"text":"Super cute. Friendly. And best of all- their stuff tastes so good. Almond butter cookies are amazeballs."}
{"text":"Everything in here is vegan! Chocolate chip cookies were chewy and moist. LOVE. I'm picky with choc chip cookies. Got a cake for myself. Quality was up there, soft and moist. DISCOUNT also given for checking in on yelp. I love this spot. Will come back for more goodies. Owners are from Germany --- the vegan capital of the world !"}
{"text":"Very satisfied overall with my experience with Vegan Bites. I called Freeds originally and they referred me to them, because I was looking for a vegan cake. I called on Wednesday night (the night before Thanksgiving ) and I explained what I wanted. The guy over the phone seemed super busy but he continued asking what I wanted and what not. Then he asked when I needed the cake and I told him Monday and he apoligized , but said he will call me back Thursday or Friday for the cake to be done on Monday. So Friday morning I get a phone call and its Vegan Cakes, I was super shocked that they remembered to call me back, because I was eventually going to get to it. haha Anyway the process was super simple, I paid over the phone for a 1/4 sheet, single layer, vegan cake with chocolate on the inside and buttercream . However, i should of said no frosting for the decorative side, it was a little too sweet. Picked up the cake 10am. NO issues at all! It was a pleasure doing business with them! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of baked goods! Their granola was awesome as well! The gf brownie was DELICIOUS!!! Can't wait to treat myself to it again!"}
{"text":"Went for the grand opening and was not let down. This place is amazing. I am trying to be more healthy and when I found that I could have a sweet snack that is dairy and gluten free I just had to try it. The carrot cake cupcake was amazing. The chocolate pieces are just perfect too. I really have to say everything I tried was just sooooooo good, definitely going to keep going!!!!!"}
{"text":"No words to describe how grateful we were to have Vegan Bites step up and help us make our 10th anniversary so special! As always Vegan Bites delivered with a fantastic cake that was the absolute best we have had since we moved here 20 years ago. Everything always tastes fresh and has that \"home made\" taste and whether if you are vegan or gluten free or not. This bakery does NOT DISAPPOINT. Truly a gem in our community and I hope they are around forever. Their cakes and cookies are that good! Thank you Vegan Bites! Photos to follow!"}
{"text":"Moist vegan cupcakes? They do exist. Very cute store with tons of goodies. Prices are great, in fact I think they should increase their pricing a tad. Fantastic deals for us tho!"}
{"text":"Oh my chocolate heaven...  Used the 15 for 30 deal and got my bday cake, it looked small but went a really long way. I did the chocolate with chocolate ganache. Probably the best dang piece of chocolate cake I've ever eaten. I'm ruined for all other chocolate cakes!   Even my family members who werent vegan, fell in love with it. It was very dense, and not dry at all. Very very rich. My favorite part? No refined sugars... Organic... And I didn't feel bad after having a small piece. I would highly highly recommend buying your cake here. Prices might seem a little steep, but a little went a very long way."}
{"text":"Had to get a cake for my son's graduation and was grateful to find this vegan bakery. The owners (seemed like owners) were so nice and (I think her name is Natalie) so willing to do anything when it comes to design. I was a little skeptical because a few reviews but I felt it's vegan and it will taste good so what the hell? Lol. And it was BEAUTIFUL and delicious. Their coffee is yummy as well. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Awesome little vegan bakery  I've order cupcakes & a custom cake from here. The cupcakes were amazing. Im not big on sweet so they were a bit too sweet for me, but all the other non vegan people didn't even know they were vegan they love them. The cake we ordered was good (I feel the same as the cupcakes too sweet for me, but everyone else loved it) the cake was a bit larger than what I had envision so next time I'll get a smaller size. If you are vegan or have dairy, eggs, gluten allergies look no further!"}
{"text":"this place is freakin awesome, the employees are nice but most importantly their cupcakes, cookies, breads, chocolates & cakes are amazing, you would never know they're vegan & organic, and it's better than most bakeries, they even have some gluten free options. everything I've had from here is so good that I end up stuffing my face like a fat a$$."}
{"text":"Vegan Bites made my husband and I our dream wedding cake back in early September. It was the cake I've always dreamed of - and then some. One layer was their AMAZING carrot cake (omg, you must try it, life changing) and the second was a vanilla with raspberry filling (my childhood favorite). Aside from being the best tasting cake I have ever had - look at how stunning it is. She added purple and yellow roses and SPARKLES because I love sparkles. I think I might have cried as hard when I saw the cake as when we said our \"I do's\". Thank you SO much for this beautiful cake. 11/10. Oh, and all of our non-vegan guests (everyone) absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Great cKes but make sure the bakery Mgr person makes sure he put the correct name on the bday cake .."}
{"text":"They had me sold when I saw organic, gmo free, and vegan. I'm not vegan nor anyone for my daughter party but i like less preservatives and more natural products. I came with pictures and specific details from my daughter for the cake and they did an amazing job! Nobody could tell it was vegan..."}
{"text":"I have two family members who are vegan so I have to compromise when it comes to food now! Walked in for a birthday cake. Customer service was great. And I took a almond cookie to go which was amazing and moist! And got a chocolate cake for my brothers birthday! The whole family enjoyed it. I will be back here for my next vegan pastry needs!!"}
{"text":"For an Organic and Gluten Free family, it's a bit hard to find accommodating bakeries. Super excited to had stumbled across this place. We have tried the cookies, cupcakes, cake pops and carrot cake/ German chocolate cake bars. Simply amazing!!! Delicious! Could not have asked for better! I cannot wait until we need a cake for an event, this will be the first place we call! Thank you Vegan Bites for providing an Organic option to our community!"}
{"text":"In no way is their treats low carb or keto OK. Vegan yes. Cupcakes were OK I guess. They were better than I imagined they'd be. Too bad they are ultra carb packed"}
{"text":"Recently checked out this bakery as I am always looking for good vegan places or places with vegan options since it's healthier, I am lactose intolerant, & it's a huge plus that it's better for the animals! ^_^  I was originally hoping to get a cake but they only make to order (which is reasonable). The lady working was very nice & explained that 48 hours is standard but when they have a slow season they can do 24 hours as well. Very cool.  Since I had never been here I just opted to get a couple of cupcakes & some other random baked goods just to try things out. They were having a 2 for 1 special on brownies (sweet!) so I got 2 walnut brownies & a chocolate chip cookie just cuz.  For the cupcakes I got red velvet & oreo. Both were yummy but I liked the sponge for the oreo best. Loved the frosting! Brownies were yummy, a little harder then I'd like but still tasty. That's mostly a personal preference & not a diss to the brownies lol, I just prefer them a little softer. Cookie was perfection!!!   I definitely see myself coming here again especially if I needed cake/cupcakes for an occasion & to try out some of their other goodies. Would definitely like to try some vegan macarons I noticed someone posted a pic of them, would like to try some of those sometime, since they are hard to come by!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Best vegan red velvet cake I've ever had!!! Staff was super nice and very helpful with my order!"}
{"text":"Started my vegan journey a few months ago for health reasons, but recently had an experience that converted me into an ethical vegan. That meant transitioning my three kids very recently... The journey hasn't been easy, but my kids (especially my oldest) were terrified that things wouldn't be as delicious as our conventional lifestyle. I might have gotten them on the wrong foot with my homemade desserts made with dates, dates, and more dates. Glad to find a bakery that is in complete alignment with my values, and tastes better than my homemade treats. My kiddos are glad too!  Every staff member was incredible... Happy to support this compassionate business!"}
{"text":"It was love at first sight with Veganbites.   My cousin and I have been planning a fun Labor Day vacation in Vegas, and after a hiccup with our airbnb place putting a downer on our vacation, we immediately stopped here to take our minds off of everything.     So glad we did.  We ordered almost everything that was available!  Cookies, cupcakes, cake slices, truffles, you name it!  We appreciate that everything is made with in house, vegan ingredients.  We don't have dedicated vegan bakeries in The OC region in Cali, too.    Everything is absolutely delicious.  Just the right amount of sweetness and amazing texture (even with the gluten free options!).    I will make sure to return here to grab some road snacks before we leave back to California.  From one vegan brother to another, you *must* try this place!  10/10!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I buy their vegan granola and use it as my morning cereal instead of oatmeal! So YUM! Satisfies sweet cravings and is delish!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb me and my gf go in here everytime we go to the movies I love this place and I'm not even vegan their desserts are amazing support this local business give it a try !!!!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place!!! So friendly and welcoming. They are so kind with questions and confusion and explain everything best to their knowledge.  10/10 amazing treats. And they always try to come up with new things they can make vegan! And they have a good assortment of GF stuff too!"}
{"text":"Needed a vegan birthday cake for my sister and we found Vegan Bites on Yelp. The carrot cake is fantastic, I'm not a vegan and have no dietary restrictions, I would absolutely get this cake again. SO good."}
{"text":"WOW! I went crazy in this bakery. Everything is vegan, so of course I tried every single cupcake and cookie. They were all INCREDIBLE. Cake pops were my favorite. I got some very tasty homemade blueberry sunflower-seed granola too, just amazing."}
{"text":"Veganbites is awesome! I recently had them make my Fiancé a Birthday Cake, she has a Dairy allergy and they made her an amazing Vegan Chocolate Cake with Cookie crumbles, and a Vegan Buttercream Frosting. My Fiancé cried of joy as she hadn't had cake in a few years due to her allergy and now she can. I also picked up 2 dozen cookies, they were awesome as well! Thanks Veganbites, you guys rock! Good job!"}
{"text":"My first foray into a vegan bakery, and it was good. I had a Groupon, so I got one of each of the cupcakes, a brownie, chocolate chip cookie and banana walnut bread.  I tried the red velvet cupcake first...and it was really dense. The frosting helped balance the flavor...the frosting is absolutely delicious! However, the cake is just too heavy for a cupcake.  The brownie was good...not to die for omg, this is heaven...but good. In fact, I wouldn't even guess it was a vegan brownie.  I will take the rest home and see how the family rates the goodies...  Update: Kids loved the goodies.  DH said cupcakes were too crumbly, but \"alright.\" The cookie and banana bread was also alright according to DH.  But, I LOVED the banana bread...the lady (sorry I don't remember her name) gave me the tip of warming it up in the microwave.  That was amazing.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I heard about this business from a vegan friend and made was on this side of town so it worked out that I was able to try the delectable bites offered here. The cashier was very well versed in the products that they offered and made. She answered all the questions I had about how they were made. The cashier was very friendly and conveyed a great attitude despite my questions.   I ended up ordering some of their brownies both with and without walnuts since the twins have different outlooks on any nuts in there food. By the way the brownies, I prefer mine with the walnuts were so moist. I love the cake pops that they sell here too with glitter too. All the cake pops needs is coffee on the side. There cake pops here are moist and the chocolate and sprinkles are good too. I took home a white chocolate Oreo filled treat and besides it being too rich it is so decadent."}
{"text":"My wife got me a Vanilla Strawberry Marble cake, I have been on a diet but she wanted me to celebrate my birthday so she got me a vegan cake. Hands down best cake ever. Texture was good and flavor was amazing. Would definitely go there."}
{"text":"If the brownies and cupcakes are representative, then it's not great...but I  applaud the fact that vegans are becoming better represented. I'm all for plant based, but it's got to taste good."}
{"text":"Love this bakery! They're my go to for birthdays and holidays and the baked goods never disappoint! The non vegans in the family can't tell the difference and they have a huge selection of flavors to choose from so everyone can satisfy their sweet tooth."}
{"text":"We forgot our prepaid, loaf of pumpkin bread on Thanksgiving :( Believe it or not, they gave us a delicious, fresh, loaf, a week late and never charged a penny extra!! This place is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"This place is totally my guilty pleasure.  They are always making new goodies, they are always welcoming with my dumb questions or if I don't know what something's is called.  Everyone who works there has been super friendly to me!  But let me tell you, the treats are freaking phenomenal, the cookies are to die for, the cakes are mouth watering, and they even make baklava I can eat because they are walnut free ???  The best part is a lot of the treats are gluten free too so I can eat them with my besties cause a lot of them are celiac :( BUT they make us easy for all of us to share the same treats."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! As good as it gets, I am totally and completely addicted. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is Vegan and they have gluten free options. The only negative is that they don't have one on my side of town. Actually, that  might be a positive because I'd be there every day. They're always friendly when I go in and some of their desserts are beyond delicious! The chocolate cupcakes , carrot cakes and the \"cheese\" cake omg heaven in your mouth"}
{"text":"Everything is refined sugar, gluten, dairy, peanut free (did I miss anything?)!!! This is heaven because I am allergic to peanut AND trying to be dairy and gluten free!!! Their date energy balls (with various protein packed seeds) r so yummy as well as their almond butter cookie (gooey and chewy!). I think they would be a good post-workout snack because of the high protein as well as the awesome taste!!   I hear their carrot cake and chocolate cake are to die for. I am going to try a slice next time I visit. Woohoo!!! They have pumpkin loaves, truffles (coconut was my fave), and other goodies such as oatmeal mix for snacking. I am so happy and excited to have found this place. I hope their business continues on!!! Woohoo!!!  Price was surprisingly good too. I bought 5 truffles and an almond butter cookie (big) for $6.50! I was pleasantly surprised! Warning tho, the truffles r very dark. I love dark chocolate but I have to be careful due to the caffeine content within the chocolate. I had three in a row (hard to stop) and had a hard time sleeping. However, I am very sensitive to caffeine because I do zero caffeine. Do try everything there!!! So far, everything has been good!!"}
{"text":"So after my review lamenting dry cupcakes, the owner contacted me asking for a second chance as seen below.  I was offered a free cupcake and a refund, so I finally made my way back.  The store manager was in and she was so nice! She knew who I was, and my name before I even said it .  So she didn't give me 1 free cupcake....she gave me 5! One of each of their non gluten free selection.  She said they had just been finished two hours ago,  and they were red velvet, chocolate, vanilla, carrot cake, and coconut. After filling up my cupcake container, she then was like, do you want cookies to? She gave me their chocolate chip cookie and their walnut fudge brownie. Then she was even was going to give me a refund still. I told her no need, she gave me so much already.  So I headed home with my hoard of baked goods.  Now after waiting about an hour they were still pretty cold from refrigeration and a bit dense but not necessarily dry, so after giving an initial taste test, I wrapped up the container in a plastic bag and let them sit over night.  This proved to help greatly, waiting at least until the reached fully room temp, it melted the coconut topping a bit, but it helped make the texture great on all the cakes....except the vanilla that was still very dry.  I did appreciate no raisens in the carrot cake though ! Also the texture of the coconut was great in that it was filled with coconut pieces. It was my favorite.  Now the icing on everything was a bit sweeter than I prefer still, especially the vanilla.  However the texture was nice and creamy.  I hope as they are open longer they get more creative with fillings and flavor profiles, maybe add some fresher components like a refreshing fruit compote or curd in the center to add acid and counteract the sweetness....and just lessen the sugar except in the chocolate that seemed to be a good sweetness level.  I know they do have what seems to be a cupcake of the week, which was the coconut in this time around.  While it was my favorite, it and everything could use an extra punch to set them apart and really make the flavors sing.    Now the brownie was hands down awesome! No need to alter anything, it truly was a fudgy peice of happiness.  The cookie was decent, almost brownie like as well, I could taste they use coconut oil.   Not sure if the intent is for it to be in the flavor, but over all I liked it.  Neither of these tasted overly sweet either.  So basically customer service 5, cake base 4.5, icing 4, originality 2.5, baked goods 4."}
{"text":"You guys- the truffles! I wanted to try something different for a coffee shop and I am so glad I did. My soy Vanilla Latte was delightful! I will definitely be back and purchasing some of these sweets for my next social gathering!"}
{"text":"Super cool staff. The food is even better. This will be my goto place for vegan baked goods."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Love the gluten free, vegan cupcakes. I will always order from here."}
{"text":"Their cakes are beautifully decorated. I bought a cake from here for my friends birthday and it was an all white rosette cake with edible glitter! She loved it!"}
{"text":"This is a must go for any vegan seeking a quick sweet snack and a caffeine pick me up! They have lots of non dairy milk options and flavor add ins for lattes. I tried a plain iced soy latte and it was a great price for the size and delicious! I also really appreciated that EVERYTHING was vegan rather than being pushed to one corner of the baking display with only two or three vegan options. Anything you point to in the pastry case is delicious and cruelty free! They also had some gluten free options and many items with no nuts as well. I was delighted to find out they do specialty cakes, for birthdays and weddings as well. I've always made my own desserts for birthdays but that option would save me a lot of time. Definitely keep this place in mind!"}
{"text":"This little bakery is really awesome! Everything I get from there is amazing and the staff is really nice. Ive had a few cookies and cupcakes, all of which were amazing. The carrot cake is my absolute favorite. This place is great!!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give 10 stars! Every time  I 'am in Vegas I fit it in my schedule to stop and get a sweet treat my favorites are the almond butter cookies.. So yum, crunchy with a chewy middle and as big as your hand, and the red velvet cupcake!! They gave samples too ... the staff is awesome and super friendly"}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have an impressive variety of cookies, cakes, and cupcakes! Their staff is always super friendly and helpful and their loyalty card is a plus.  Go try this place!!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered a vegan cake for my birthday. He said it was easy to do online. He ordered it same day with delivery, which Im impressed they were able to do. The cake was pretty and super delicious! We loved the coconut outer layer. I can't wait to go to the bakery and get more vegan goodies!"}
{"text":"I am so pleased with VeganBites! I ordered a double layer red velvet birthday cake with buttercream frosting inside and chocolate ganache outside. It was superb and so beautiful! Our omni friends couldn't get enough of it.  The red velvet was moist and lovely, the buttercream was light and perfectly salty, and the chocolate ganache tasted like a high-end fudge.  The woman who helped me (presumably the owner) was a delight. And since I spent over $50, I was given a dozen delicious assorted cookies for free. That was really nice.   Truly impressed by the taste as well as the service here. This was exactly what I requested and more. I will absolutely be returning next time I want something sweet!"}
{"text":"Went in to get a treat for my daughter after our movie. I'd say you should change a couple of things. The nat or flying bug you have in your cookie display case. Might be a good idea to get that out. Also, don't display Christmas cookie as you could purchase and then tell us we can't unless you buy a dozen. Broke my kid's heart having to take away a cookie she wanted. You get two stars, because the cookies we did get were good. Customer service, not so much."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: it's an organic, vegan,extremely Allergan friendly local bakery.  That alone gives it 1 star.   The truffles are AMAZING.  I wish id ordered more of these! (I got the almond truffle)  The apple puff pastry pie was also AMAZING!!!    The chocolate coins were good as well.  Now for the bad:  The \"cheesecake\" I tried was very disappointing.  I tried both the strawberry and the Keylime and didn't finish either of them...they were very salty for some reason and just didn't resemble cheesecake at all.  I know cheesecake is not the easiest thing to make vegan but it can be done. Veganbites does not seem to have it down though.   I don't like leaving bad reviews but I feel like anyone who orders this expecting cheesecake is going to be extremely disappointed.  I know I was.    All in all I will return because they do have some really good product.   My advice to them would be to pull the cheesecakes from the menu until they can perfect the recipe or at the very minimum re-name them because they taste nothing like cheesecake.  I say this with nothing but good intentions, because I want to see them succeed, and I don't want anyone else to walk away dissapointed like I did.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but either way I was shocked that anyone could actually put those out to sell...they simply weren't edible to me.  Try the puff pastry pies and try the truffles.  Worth going just for those items :)"}
{"text":"If 0 stars was an option I surely would select 0 stars. They for one advertise themselves as a vegan bakery but vegans BEWARE they are NOT. If you are going to get coffee here they carry dairy creamers that the non-vegan staff have no clue aren't vegan. They will tell you that all the creamers there are 100% vegan, non dairy creamers because they are clueless. When I made the owner aware of the situation he not only was the most condescending jerk I have ever talked to, He said, and I quote, \"as a customer you should investigate any and all places that you choose to shop if 100% vegan compliance is important to you.\" I think that if you are entering a vegan establishment you shouldn't have to investigate. It should simply be vegan.  And shouldn't 100% vegan compliance be important to a vegan establishment? If you can't trust that the coffee is vegan or not I wouldn't touch anything from the kitchen. They obviously have no clue what is important to vegans. They would rather cater to the surrounding businesses than to the vegan customer base. another quote from him, \"Although we aim to please every customer and value your opinion. In the spirit of giving all customers the option to choose the type of creamer they like in there coffee, we chose to carry dairy creamer. Many customers in the surrounding businesses have asked for this choice\" I feel those customers that want dairy creamer should go to mad house coffee right across the street if they want dairy, But if they are going to a vegan establishment they should espect VEGAN. The poor choices being made in this establishment are appalling. I will never return to vegan bites again, and I recommend you not either.  They are obviously more influenced by money than actually trying to make the vegan society here better. Pathetic!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great and has some of the best vegan cupcakes I have ever had. Would definitely recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Lady at the counter was supper friendly. Vegan GF oatmeal cookies so good . Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We chose this place to buy a birthday cake for my mother. We saw that they are open at convenient times which is a plus! This bakery is the from the opposite side of town from where I live so it takes quite a bit to get here. In the end it was worth coming here! First off the cake is moist and delicious, we ordered a two layer 9\" cake and it can serve a lot of people since the portions are large. The flavor was strawberry shortcake with chocolate ganache frosting. The frosting wasn't too sweet and was just right for me and the cake was vanilla flavor, I like the texture and the unique flavor it had. It's hard to describe, but it was great nonetheless. The fresh strawberries were all sweet and juicy. I think that was the best part of it all. I would recommend their cakes if you are looking for something different! The cookies were great and tasted just right with the right amount of sweetness. I also tried their coconut macaroons and they were great! You have to eat them quick because they will get hard after a couple of hours of opening the package. I will definitely come back again. Thank you for making the birthday cake in time as well!"}
{"text":"Veganbits Bakery  Veganbits Bakery is going to be my go to Bakery for cakes for now on. I just picked up a birthday cake today and it's one of the best cakes I ever had. I hope this place stays around for a long time and surprisingly am nowhere close to being a Vegan but still really enjoy the cakes. I think there up their with The Cheesecake Factory. And one of the best Organic and Non-GMO cakes around. You definitely should give them a try."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had is delicious. My favorite is the chocolates with ganache. Their drinks are good as well. The staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"The icing on the Cupcakes taste like the real deal! I can't believe it's Vegan lol this place is definitely worth trying forsure."}
{"text":"Great tasting allergy free food!!!!! So excited to finally find a bakery that not only has vegan options for my kiddo but also wheat/soy/corn/dairy free!"}
{"text":"Came for the grand opening with my mom and sister after our hot pilates class. This place is so cute. They had a bunch of samples for people to try. My mom loved the vanilla date bites and the blueberry quinoa granola was super good too... Definitely going to buy some and mix with some vanilla yogurt!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and it was the best accident ever. Amazing food! They have a mix of everything from vegan to gluten free. The brownies are great! The cookies are amazing! Nothing but great things to say about this gem."}
{"text":"I am really into eating better but it's so hard to give up sweets!! So when I find a healthier version of sweets, I definitely try it! I no longer eat anything with corn syrups and artificial sweeteners because they make my body feel awful. When I found this place, and saw they make nothing with artificial sugar, I had to go for it.   I got two chocolate chip cookies. A day old one packaged and one in the cooler/display.  I really enjoyed the packaged day old cookie so much better. I also bought a slice of New York Style Cheesecake and a wrapped peanut butter cup. I absolutely loved that cheesecake and still wonder how you made it taste like that, without animal products. Amazing.   I will love to come back and try your cakes next. Thank you for your delicious treats!"}
{"text":"Popped in while I waited for my haircut appt next door.  Got baklava and a mini double choc cookie.   Baklava was great, cookie was extremely dry and customer service left plenty to be desired.    Prices seem average.  Would be curious to try one of the cakes still, but they don't seem to care much about return business."}
{"text":"Let me put this out there: I'm not vegan.   I have friends who are, and I wanted to make sure that they had something sweet to eat at my wedding reception.  I chose this place based on its Yelp reviews, and I stopped in two weeks ago to find something to serve.  They had a double chocolate chip cookie that was ENORMOUS, and I bought one of those to try.   It. Was. Delicious.    So I called last week, and ordered a dozen.    When I picked up, we tried one of their brownies with walnuts:  to die for!!!    Service was great, and super nice.  They made the whole process so easy!!  The cookies were a huge hit, and I had NONE left to take home.    Excellent job, Veganbites!  Thank you so much for helping to take care of my guests!"}
{"text":"While we were in Vegas last week we we're celebrating a birthday so I ordered a chocolate cake from this location. We have never tried vegan pastries before but we will definitely try them again. The cake was great!  The chocolate brownie without wheat was also great. I snacked on it the whole week as a late night treat.   Thank you for making our birthday celebration complete! We will stop in again next year when we return for vacation."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The truffles and mini cupcakes are amazing. I love the vanilla flavor. Employees are very nice. And they answered all of my questions. Will definitely head back there again soon for another treat."}
{"text":"We were visiting for my boyfriend's birthday. I dealt with the bakery over emails. They were so helpful with recommendations and my custom designs. The final product looked and tasted amazing!! I highly recommend this place. I cannot wait to visit the actual location for more treats."}
{"text":"I love Vegan Bites cakes and desserts! I ordered a birthday cake for my best friend and it was perfect! The only reason for a 4-star rating is because my boss's birthday cake was not ready as promised this morning. Our team was a bit disappointed because we had to take a premade cake instead. Other than that, very lovely & tasty desserts! Makes me love being a vegan"}
{"text":"So happy I found out about this place . I got the chocolate cup cake, the cake pop with almond crunch and three different flavor cookies . They were all deeeeelicious . I will be going back . I will support any small business any day that uses all organic and non GMO ingredients !! I'm glad people are trying to make a difference !"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so delicious and the owners are really nice. I had their cupcakes and I think they're better than traditional dairy cupcakes. Also, they offer gluten free. Go give them a visit."}
{"text":"Love this place every time we are there to get our dairy free gluten free dessert!  Anybody with vegan options, gluten free option or dietary options check them out for your dessert treats... They do take order for any occasions cakes!   New items weekly.  I can't wait to go back there.  I love there chocolate truffles too!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic all around! Sells mostly desserts with a few snacks. I ordered cake pops, a few cookies and \"cheese\" popcorn. They also serve coffee and you can custom order cakes. All vegan! Amazing for people with food allergies. The lady who served us was very friendly and greeted us right away, she was delightful the whole time.  The cookies and cake pops were very moist and delicious. The popcorn was a little stale but the flavor of the cheese was still great so it didn't take away from the awesomeness of a vegan being able to have cheesy popcorn. My mother in law visited a few days later and she is not vegan and tried the truffles and claimed they are the best she has ever had and shared them with everyone she could find!  Vegans and non vegans alike can appreciate this wonderful bakery! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Bought an 8 pack cupcake sampler for some vegan employees and a slice of the banana nut bread with chocolate chips. Both were a big hit!"}
{"text":"I honestly did not care for the cupcakes or the cookies. Both had a grainy/ earthy taste that I did not like. However, the blueberry loaf that I got was delicious! It was full of blueberries and topped with a lemon glaze. They were selling them by the slice or you could get a whole loaf. It was my first time and I wasn't sure if I'd like it so I only got a slice, but I wish I'd gotten an entire loaf instead.  It's located in a strip mall. I'd go back to try more bread/loaf flavors."}
{"text":"Just had the best red velvet cake for my B-Day.  Vegan bites made a custom cake that blew my socks off.  Stopped in at VegeNation and shared it around.  It was a huge hit.  Thank you Vegan bites for making my 30th special."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is amazing, this is the second time I order a custom cake from here. And they have went out of their way to give it that special touch and accommodate a a last minute request. My mom loved the cake so much she didn't want to cut the cake. It was a double layer marble cake with chocolate butter cream filling and lavender with white roses all over the cake. OMG the taste was smoothing lightly sweet taste. It's a must even if your not vegan you will enjoy the taste. Love this place and they are super nice people. Highly recommend! You made my mom 70th Birthday Special"}
{"text":"I've only visited once, but I gotta say I will definitely be back! Even though I live across town, the yummy vegan treats and friendly service are totally worth the drive.   For my co-worker's birthday, I ordered a 9 inch single layer chocolate cake with oreos, bak lava (has honey), and  truffles (almond, coconut, cacao, and oreo).  They misspelled my coworker's name (not faulting them too much...his name is unique) and were able to re-do the the top of the cake in a few minutes.   I wasn't sure how my non-vegan co-workers were going to feel about the treats, but they all loved it and said the cake tasted better than other cakes."}
{"text":"This little gem has me totally enamored with their delicious vegan, gluten-free treats. The entire menu is vegan (aside from the baklava, which is made with honey and clearly labeled as such), and nearly everything can be made gluten-free. There truly is something for everyone; there are cookies, cupcakes, cheesecakes, pies, cake bites, and more.  I have been quite a few times and find myself repeatedly ordering the red velvet cupcake with \"sundae\" topping: frosting topped with rainbow sprinkles, chocolate syrup, and a maraschino cherry, a.k.a. pure happiness. I also am a huge fan of the \"yo-yo\": two cookies with frosting sandwiched between, and coated with your choice of rainbow sprinkles, Oreos, or nuts.   If you're fortunate enough to drop in around Thanksgiving, Vegan Bites has the most amazing pumpkin pie. Seriously, their heavenly pies will totally make your holiday season complete. In addition, there also is an option to pre-order apple or pecan pie.   I could go on and on about the amazingness of Vegan Bites, but instead, I highly suggest you try it yourself; you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Key points that compelled me to drive across town: 1) wheat-free and gluten-free recipes. 2) organic. Let me say this again, ORGANIC! Ok, I was shouting with glee. 3) homemade almond butter here and used in the recipes.   What I happily discovered: *Free coffee days *Almond butter cookies are a great texture and delicious  *Friendly staff, thank you Courtney *Fresh from the oven. We boxed up a fresh batch of cookies and a glazed lemon blueberry cake loaf  *Check-in and there's a Yelp coupon for a discount on a cake  Wish List: Come to Summerlin, please."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have an egg allergy and had never had a brownie until now. What a blessing to have this bakery. Will be back many times over."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious!! The chocolate cupcake. Carrot cupcake.

The brownie was pretty good too but the cupcakes were definitely the star!! Will definitely come back again!! Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"This an embarrassment of a cake. This looks like it was designed by a blind drunk toddler. Was it their first day using the piping tool? Look at the photo. I was promised a high end cake. This cost me over $100.   I could have gotten a nicer cake at a grocery store.   THEN when I called. I was able to talk to one of the workers just fine, then when the worker handed the phone over to the  owner/manager. She pretended that she couldn't hear me over the phone.   Finally, she calls me back and says that they can't use fondant and that the designs have to be hand piped.  There's still 0 excuse for it looking the way it does using any technique.   If you screw up, own up to it, fix it. Stop making excuses.   Stay away. Place like this don't deserve high ratings."}
{"text":"Incredible customer service and delicious vegan goodies. My husbands vegan chocolate cake was so good! Our non vegan family members kept raving about it."}
{"text":"I ordered a vanilla cake with fresh strawberry filling! It was so delicious and moist! No one expected it to be vegan! Thank you so much for the delicious and beautiful cake! In addition, I received 1 dozen of cookies. I tried the double chocolate, oatmeal, and chocolate chip. They all taste delicious and are so moist! Thank you so much for the services!"}
{"text":"Amazing to walk into a bakery and be able to eat everything in it as a vegan! The non vegan part of my group loves the Treats too. Key lime cheesecake my favorite!"}
{"text":"Just purchased a fudge cake and it was delicious! Also tried their key lime cheesecake and my only regret is not getting the whole pie! I will be back, cannot wait to explore their varieties on their menu!"}
{"text":"I am not a Vegan and they're desserts are amazing to be made of natural ingredients. Purchased a variety of items and all good!"}
