{"text":"I love this place. They only opened this week and I've already been in twice, once for dinner and then another for lunch. Both times, the service was impeccable. Their staff  are beautiful and friendly. I loved the Venus 75 but then again I'm partial to Hendricks gin. They also have a pretty good bottle of cava. The tapas selection was amazing but I suggest leaving room for dessert. The churros are divine!"}
{"text":"Please don't eat here. I had to send a very oily appetizer back and I am now concerned about throwing up all night over dodgy mussels. Lots of good restaurants in Calgary but this is not one of them. Can I do negative stars?!"}
{"text":"We had a disappointing experience.   We had a reservation for 1045pm on a Friday night, but this did not stipulate that the kitchen would be closed.   The front staff was not helpful in suggesting other local options, and was not at all apologetic.   If you think this is a reasonable late night eating option, as it is outlined in Avenue magazine.    It isn't."}
{"text":"A nice place for cocktails and tapas, with a large open space, modern decoration. The various fresh fruit + herb bevvies were inspired (e.g. Sage & Grapefruit, or Basil & Strawberry), and they have red, white, and cava sangrias that are on special in the weekends. The paella was really well made, and the short rib empanadas weren't skimpy for the price. Touches like a menu item for buying the kitchen a 6-pack of beers, and an accommodating hostess mean we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time 2wks ago for lunch with a friend. Only 2 tables were taken, front girl asked where I wanted to sit... WOW... when 2 women usually walk in one of these places on 8th Ave for lunch, they are seated in the worst place possible.  5/5 stars for service  Waitress: Very friendly and informative.  5/5 stars for the waitress.  Food:  Shared the Lobster Ravioli as an appetizer and the short rib dip as a main. To die for...  5/5 stars for food."}
{"text":"I'm glad we finally got to try out Barcelona Tavern last Friday. Our teens, who love tapas and paella were thrilled that they could enjoy the experience with us (until 10 pm anyway!) Our server was very busy but managed to serve our group quite well, with the exception of water refills... The dishes that we ordered arrived within a short amount of time and they were all amazing! I particularly loved the 'Bomba', Veal meatballs, and the Paprika Prawns. The Paella was good too, though we did find it a tad greasy.  I love that they have a Gin bar and hubby and I were both very happy with our cocktails. It is a fairly loud spot because of the acoustics of the restaurant but it has a fun, late night vibe. Oh, and the churros were pretty darn good too!"}
{"text":"Waited at the door with no hostess until we sat ourselves. Waited more for the waitress... finally ordered a margarita, but it came with no crushed ice (at $10 it should I think). Ordered the steak, but they don't sell steaks any more. How can a restaurant in Calgary not sell steak? We waited some more for the waitress again then we paid for the drinks and left to go to the keg, which was awesome. The menu here does not suite to the downtown crowd i think, maybe hipsters but not the business after work. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We tried Barcelona Tavern this weekend, as reading their Big Taste Calgary menu had a similar effect to Pavlov's bell.  Only upon arriving to the restaurant did we realize that Barcelona is the new Belgo.  The decor changed a little, for the better - it felt brighter and a bit more inviting than the prior eatery.  The service started off pretty slow.  We were seated for around 10 minutes before we had our drink order taken.  Our first tapa arrived before our bottle of wine, so the kitchen was on its game.  The food was pretty tasty - of the 5 tapas on the set Big Taste menu, only one (the veal cheek) was a miss.  The little potato bomba balls were delicious, crispy on the outside and warm and soft in the middle, and were only outshone by the cannoli and kahlua ice cream.  Had the food portions been a bit bigger, I would have awarded another star.  However, after a 5 course tapa meal (with a bonus bomba ball thrown in by the chef), we were still left somewhat hungry.  I would still recommend this restaurant for drinks and appetizers, though (and would suggest that the men check out the washrooms for an interesting and mildly disturbing surprise... don't ask me how I know)!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place so far. Brand new reinvention of the Belgo that was there before.   Been there three times the week it opened and can say that most everything I tried was tasty and the beer selection was great. It feels a little crammed with the tables the way they are situated. Particularly when you first come in and have to navigate through highly packed tables to get to the back.   But I will most certainly be back. Love the tapas idea when you can order your own meal and the salads were great. Although the tapas were $$ for what you actually got. Skip the pork belly. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The service here deserves zero stars since there really was no service.  I made a reservation for two for Thursday night dinner and drinks.  When we got to the restaurant, the hostess said that she didn't have a reservation under my name.  This is after I received a confirmation email and a reminder email asking me to confirm my reservation.  We weren't too annoyed because we were eventually given a table at the back of the restaurant.  The waitress in charge of our section was INCOMPETENT.  Even someone who has never worked in the service industry knows that by serving alcohol the bill increases significantly.  So the first thing you should ask is if the table would like alcohol...especially on a game night.  After about fifteen minutes of watching our waitress take orders from tables with guests who arrived after us, she finally gets to our table to drop off two napkins and leaves without saying a word.  We called her back, but she ignored us and kept on walking.  Another ten minutes go by and she stops by our table again, but the table behind us calls to her and she leaves our table to serve them.  That was it.  We got up and left.    Save your money and go elsewhere.  There is nothing special about Barcelona except for the horrible service.    I am truly disappointed in this restaurant in the Downtown Core."}
{"text":"Honestly wasn't sure what to expect from Barcelona, another Spanish tapas restaurant in Calgary? Alright, let's do this!  I don't think you can go any more Spanish than paella (which is what I ordered) and for the life of me, I can't remember what my friend got (not a good sign, food should be memorable!)  Presentation was great, bright yellow rice and a plethora of seafood. Sadly, it was pretty lackluster. I think I ate all the seafood and didn't eat much of bland rice.  We did get dessert though! The churros were everything I expected them to be - delicious deep fried goodness sprinkled with icing sugar and side of dulce de leche.  Would I be back? For dessert yes (they have raspberry cheesecake and smore churros) but probably not for anything else."}
{"text":"An improvement over the previous Belgo concept. Newer, fresher look, good menu and service is definitely more attentive and professional.   I brought my small but mighty work team here for a goodbye luncheon. They were quick to take our drink order without making us feel rushed. They returned in a reasonable amount of time for our lunch orders. I had the chicken prosciutto club and it was very well made with a great presentation. The side salad was tasty with a perfect balance of lettuce and fixings with a tangy house dressing. The sandwich had a tomato type dipping sauce that also was quite good with a lot of flavour. Another coworker had a burger and he said it was tasty, albeit large. Service remained spot on throughout the meal.  Its a larger space and therefor can fit a lot of tables but the noise levels were still comfortable - we could still converse. Things were quite clean and fresh looking to in terms of layout and design. The menu had a great range of options from share items to more traditional sandwiches, entrees etc. There are a few other things I'd like to try next time I go (always a good sign if you are thinking of a next time).  You can reserve online which also always gets points with me!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed 2 good meals there.  Looking forward to trying the brunch.  Very friendly and accommodating staff.  Also, this restaurant is committed to community service and will be supporting Robin Hood Army - a volunteer organization formed to feed the homeless - for which we are very grateful."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for brunch on a Saturday afternoon at this place. It wasn't very busy at all, lots of empty space. We placed our order for our food and waited about 40 mins before we got it. That being said the food was all very tasteful and you could tell it was prepared fresh, so if you're wanting to go here you should be prepared for a wait even if it's fairly empty. I had the grilled cheese with the tomato bisque (so good) and a couple other friends got the Huevos Rancheros (was delicious with sausage but if you have a big appetite, the portion is a bit small) and the Chorizo Poppers (also very good). Our waitress was a bit rude, at one point a friend asked for a water glass as she didn't get one. Instead of a standard apology and offering to get another glass the waitress responded with \"you should have gotten one, but I guess I'll get you another one\" as if we had stashed a glass in our purse or something  One person had severe dietary restrictions due to medical issues and specifically requested no cheese on her omelette, but when it arrived it was full of cheese. Rather than say something and wait another 40 minutes for another omelette she ended up eating it and feeling pretty sick. It's a shame because the food was good, but that's not enough to bring me back to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here for a work lunch..... they seemed to either misplace our reservation or just not log it, which I don't see how since a co-worker used opentable. Eight of us ended up getting placed on a round table made for 5, which didn't leave much elbow room.   The space? Looks pretty good, the service - could do much better. We all ordered our own dishes except we shared the Parmesan Truffle Frites & Lobster Ravioli... both delicious! I ordered the House salad with dressing on the side and it came as asked... a co-worker ordered the same as me but without the pumpkin seeds and got both the seeds and dressing.. people seemed confused with our table in general,  The wine list looked promising and I want to go back and try out some more tapas..."}
{"text":"When you're at a private event and the waitresses are more drunk than the customers How are the waitresses allowed to drink shooters on the job?"}
{"text":"I booked an online reservation for this place, and had called the day before the reservation date to ensure that we would have a rooftop seat. I was told that my table was confirmed to be upstairs by the host. However when we arrived, we were told the upstairs was completely full. They gave us a table on the bottom floor telling us the wait for upstairs would be too long. Fine. After we ordered our food I went upstairs to take a look because my boyfriend was raving about how cute their upstairs was. To my disappointment there was plenty of empty tables upstairs, and four seats at the bar. As I looked before my eyes they gave the four bar seats to two walk-in couples! We were not informed that we could sit at these bar seats so I was very unhappy by their oversight. We also asked to be resat downstairs because it was too windy and they did not help us moves our plates and cutlery which is standard etiquette. My chair was also dirty with crumbs from the previous customer.   The patates bravas had way too much skin, did not enjoy. Seafood paella was okay, tomates Barcelona was good, fried manchego was good. Rioja sangria was fine but maybe actual fruits in it would've been tasty instead of strained.   Will not be returning. Waitress was nice but poorly managed by hostess."}
{"text":"Great new place in downtown Calgary!  We went for drinks and some late night snacks and really enjoyed it. Tried the little fondue with baguette crisps, drizzled with a spicy oil. Really good! The patatas bravas were okay. The churros though! Oh, the churros!! They knocked it out of the park with that one!  I tried a Strawberry and basil gin and tonic. Amazingly refreshing with real strawberry slices and tons of basil leaves, then topped off with freshly cracked black pepper.  Perfectly balanced drink!   Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Hosted a Farewell party there last night and had a blast!! I worked with Molly, their event coordinator, to set up the event and she was amazzzzing and so patient even when I was flip flopping ideas. The interior has great ambiance, the food was perfect and all the staff were super friendly and on the ball! Very pleased and will keep on returning there, and you should too!"}
{"text":"Went there to watch a World Cup match on Saturday. Knowing that it was still within Brunch-o-clock made us nervous about getting seating however we were seated on the patio and near to the screens just fine. All food we ate was honestly divine. The truffle fries were extremely crunchy, the lobster ravioli creamy and delicious, and the star was the paella. This is after coming back from Barcelona two months ago. So well seasoned and the seafood was extremely fresh and tender. Overall yum! The only disadvantage to this experience was that the patio was extremely hot because of the blaring hot sun and so we were sweating in our chairs. Could have used a couple patio umbrellas for shade."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  The management kept everyone happy and made sure everyone was having a good time.  I would recommend this place and I would go back."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The waitress was lazy and uninterested. She forgot to bring items out and our table of 4 ate all at different times. The manager was so unprofessional to the point of complaining about the waitress himself.  Food was average but over priced for the portion size."}
{"text":"So some friends and I decided to visit my friend Courtney who's working at Barcelona Tavern in liberty village. I had passed by a couple of times and it didn't seem busy but if you glance upstairs you'll see where all the action is. Nice decor and fantastic staff that will make you feel welcomed. We decided to try a few items on the menu. It's tapas but the portions didn't seem small. Between the three of us we had the Patatas Braves, Veal Bomba, Chorizo Poppers, Lobster Ravioli....and an order of Brioche Bread. We we're all beyond full by the time we put down out utensils. I have to say the food was fantastic.....beyond my expectations. Now normally I would take pics of each plate before digging in but as you can see from the pics.....this didn't happen. The food was too good to pause and take pics. Maybe next time because I plan to be a regular here. Cheers and ask for Courtney to be your server she's the best!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get together and enjoy a wide selection of bevvies and tapas. The servers are friendly and attentive, the drink selection very good quality, and the food is maybe not exactly what you'd find in Spain, but a great take on it at least.  I was there during the Champions League final, and it was a packed house since FC Barcelona was in it! A great vibe. I didn't have a reservation, and was just a singleton from out of town, but they had set aside a room for randoms like us to get together and create our own party. ;-)  The whole tavern worked hard to make sure people had what they wanted during the entire crush. A difficult feat but they seemed to manage well.  There was an extra long wait for my Bombas (potato chorizo croquettes) to come out, so they were gracious enough to supply me with an order of paprika prawns on polenta. Which just so happened to be the next thing I was going to order!  Both the bombas and the prawns were very well made. The croquettes were crispy on the outside, succulent smooth inside, and topped with a very rich tomato sauce and manchego cheese. The prawns themselves were standard tail-on frozen prawns, but the polenta made the dish delicious, lots of depth of flavour in the grits themselves, and then some great seasoning and lardons overtop"}
{"text":"We went to Barcelona Tavern with 8 of us and not a single one left without being completely satisfied. We all shared tapas, the favorites were by far the Bamba, followed by the veal meatballs, and the parmesan truffle fries. A friend had the Messi burger and all you could hear through his bites was \"this is possibly the best burger I've ever had.\" The service was fantastic, Tamara was amazing and very friendly and attentive. Dessert. Oh my gosh dessert. We had the pistachio creme brulee,  Spanish sticky toffee and the churros,  none of us know which was the best! We ate almost everything and would have eaten everything except we were going to explode.  Can't say it enough, unbelievable job on the food. Amazing decor and fantastic friendly service!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch.  Both times have experienced good food and good service.  One of my friends is on a gluten-free diet, and there several dishes are gluten free, though the server stumbled a little and had to check it out before coming back and pointing them out.  She did it cheerfully so still full marks.  I had the paella, and it was delish.  Very nicely made and the seafood was very good.  One of my friends had burger and fries and the fries (which were tested by the table) was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (yes!).   Overall, good noise level, high ceilings.  One small minus - unless you get a table on the mezzanine up front or a booth, you will be seated at a table with high bar stool chairs,  If you are uncomfortable with those, make sure you point it out or ask / reserve something else.  I didn't like it, my legs dangled.  Otherwise god place, fast service."}
{"text":"This a very interesting, albeit a little bit confused, upscale-ish pub downtown. Here's a few things it does really well: drinks (particularly gin-based), food quality, restaurant layout. On the other hand, here's what it doesn't do so well: atmosphere, service, some food prices.  Best bet here is to come on Monday night to take advantage of their pizza specials. We had the mushroom pizza and the veal one. Very high quality with fresh ingredients. These will run your $10 each and are a sizable portion. Sangria is on special that night as well for $17 a pitcher and is of very high quality and comes in three varieties. The tomatoes Barcelona was delicious as well.  Things to avoid are the lobster ravioli ($12 for two pieces... not exactly a share plate) and the manchego fondue (which is 8 pieces of bread a very tiny cheese-based dip).   Barcelona has a number of gin-based drinks. I tried the lemon-ginger, strawberry-basil, and grapefruit-sage. All were excellent. I do not recommend the $3 tonic upgrade, however, as it isn't particularly noticeable.  The restaurant was completely dead; roughly 8 or 9 tables of 2-4 people, yet service was surprisingly slow. We had to flag down our server to order food, and he seemed a bit surprised. Plenty of staff, mainly hostesses, roaming around. Seems to me that there are some kinks to work out but it's nothing that can't be fixed."}
{"text":"We'd been passing by the \"Opening Soon\" notices on the outside of this place for a long time and recently place opened up. We decided to give it a try on a chilly night mainly because it's close by. The skinny: you'll eat and drink just fine here and you'll enjoy the open space upstairs. Solid 3.5 Just don't expect a Barcelona vibe.   We were seated upstairs - it's a selling feature. It was about half full on a Tuesday night around 8:30. The roof and walls retract to make this a patio on warm days, so at first I was surprised to see that there were tons of TV screens affixed to any available surface. Seven screens, all tuned to sports. I was more surprised to see some of the Spanish fare in the menu emerging in the form of burgers, pizzas, cheese sticks, and wings. Mind you, we didn't have the paella, which is their main Spanish-style offering. The tapas list is not too long, and we chose veal bombas (meatballs with tomato sauce), calamari (fried) and patatas bravas. We had a Barça G & T to start, which was delivered in elegant wine glass and tasted good - with orange essence, just like a negroni.  All three dishes delivered well, if on the lukewarm side, as if they'd just been warmed and prepped, but not actually prepared. The three were tasty, but there was nothing stand-outish about the taste or texture any of them. The meatballs (3 of them for $16) were both a touch overdone, and not hot enough. The tomato sauce they were served with tasted somewhat canned / commercial. The sauces with the calamari ($14) were much fresher. The potatoes ($10) are interesting, smashed new-ish potatoes (new-ish since quite thick-ish skins) served with a fried egg on top and in an orangey tomato sauce that might have had cheese (feta) in it? This is a decent twist on bravas, if you're in the mood for a plate of fried potatoes."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. My guest ordered a Steak and Frittes. It was served practically raw. She was waiting for the server to come by and check to see how everything was, however the server didn't show up until much later when everyone else had just about finished their meal. Now it was too late to send it back. the server then took the meal back to the kitchen and returned to say that chef agreed with her that her steak was under cooked. My guest left without having any lunch."}
{"text":"Barcelona Tavern is a totally funky space with bright coloured, graffiti art, large glass vases and plenty of space. Spread out over two levels with plenty of booths and a large floor that could be opened - you could throw one heck of a party here! And this very well may be the case during a Friday or Saturday night, but on a mellow Monday, we had quite the different experience with some incredible moments and some not so note worthy. How you play your card at Barcelona will depend whether you have an ok experience or a great one. For the sake of positivity and if you know what to expect, I'm going with 4-stars in this review.:)  Here's what to do:  What to do: 1. Go here on a Monday night for their 10 pizza special. Our group of yelpers went with the Truffled Mushroom one and the Cow Pie and fell head over heels for the mushroom one. For $10, this is a steal of a deal and the perfect item to wash down their delicious and creative Gin & Tonics.  2. Get their delicious and creative Gin & Tonics! I had the Strawberry Basil and the Saskatoon berry ones. Both were incredible. Fresh fruit and herbs and so many Saskatoon berries muddled in their it was almost difficult to drink. This is a great choice for an after work or after dinner drink.  3. Monday Sangria special - These were right up their with the Gin & Tonics and if you come in on a Monday, they're cheap too! A jug of Sangria and a Mushroom Truffle pizza for $27? Such a great offer!  4. The Churros are out of this world. I may have finished the chocolate sauce on a spoon and dipped in the leftover sugar.  What not to do: I'm not too fully versed in the world of tapas, and while I know they are small bar snacks, I've always ordered a variety to share among the table, the end result being a decently balanced multi-course meal that everyone gets to share into at one time.   At Barcelona Tavern, the tapas seemed a little more like an appetizer section on a pub menu. Great as a snack, but any combination of them isn't really going to add up into what you would call a full dinner.   Certain items were plated really strangely for sharing, like the Tomatoes Barcelona on two large pieces of bread (which we then awkwardly tried to rip apart with our butter knifes so we could share with the group) or the Lobster Ravioli, while freaking delicious, is only two raviolis. Really hard to share between multiple people.  I think some friendly advice or suggestions from the servers to order a good tapas meal with the right amount of food would go a long way here. On such a slow night, it seemed there was plenty of room to be wowed by great service, but it was pretty much non-existent.  I'd love to come back to continue working my way through that delicious cocktail list and to order that Mushroom pizza on a Monday again. But for a seated meal with table service, as of right now, I think I'd give it a miss.  Seriously though.. Those gins! Go now!  Huge thanks to Sarah W. for throwing an Unnoficial Yelp Event here so we could check it out! If you don't already follow her reviews, you definitely should! - https://www.yelp.ca/user_details?userid=h1Vsz24g7TLA9ZfIDiFjbw"}
{"text":"Every place has their off nights but this place was practically empty on a Saturday night and I think I know why.   The service was not about the new customer, it was about the friends at the bar and the pretty people.   Rarely will I give a yelp of despair but Barcelona Tavern gets my saddest regrets.  It looks like it could be a very great place to party.   The menu offers intriguing choices, like breaded Manchego Cheese, which is a very elegant and tasty appetizer and pairs well with beer,  if it's cooked correctly and not overly salted.    Parmesan fries also pair well with beer, unless they are terrible. And we were hungry, we'd been on a street photo shoot and needed something to eat before continuing.  Hint to the wise,  if the fry is not good in a restaurant or bar,  then the rest of the food probably isn't that good either.  I loved the bull above the bar.  I loved that the high tables and modern décor were open and clean and simple. I'm sorry that this place was so dead on a Saturday night but it may not just be due to an economy downturn,  it may well be because of the service and the food."}
{"text":"Opening weekend gives it two stars, but I recommend waiting for them to get their act together, if you really need to try them.  Food that is not properly prepared, service that is amateur, and a menu that is way over priced and has paper napkins, an atmosphere that lacks inspiration, I don't see them staying open for longer than 6 months.  Maybe good for lunch but with the time it took to serve us, it might be dinner time before you are served.  If you want Tapas, there are much better places in town to go to that will cost less, allow you to hear each other, have better service, and much better food.   The upside is that the patrons get to know each other as the compare how bad the experience is."}
{"text":"Saturday night at 7pm and the manager is upstairs on his laptop, he acted like we were interrupting him. And good restaurant manager knows that at 7pm on a Saturday your ass better be on the floor.  Place was empty, it will be closed in 6 months, only reason we went there is it was the only place on the block without a wait.  Hostest was extremely rude which is why we needed the manager in the first place. Stay away.  I hope the owner reads this and re-evaluates management."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out so I convince my friend to join me. The place is interesting with 2 floors with patio space in both. We went upstairs and sat at the bar. I especially liked the retractable roof and the staff were friendly.  However, the food and drinks did not do it for me. We ordered a small paella and a pitcher of sangria. The paella was disappointing in terms of the size even though it was a small. I remember the taste from my Ibiza trip and wanted to see how their take was. There was lots of seafood like mussels, clams, calamari and shrimp that complemented the rice. I was hoping for a bigger size but the taste was just ok.  In terms of the sangria, it was created on the spot and poured in the pitcher.  The fruit and juice was at the bottom and then wine at the top. I asked if it should be mixed while the bartender poured it out. So you can see my glass be red with mostly wine while my friend had a very light orange colour with mostly juice. There was a lot of ice as well. I wished it was pre-mixed like in Ibiza where they let the fruit sit in the wine for at least a day.  I'll likely wait for a while before returning again."}
{"text":"We came to Calgary for a weekend getaway and stayed at a hotel in downtown area. The restaurant is on a very busy street with a lot of bars and other restaurants. We went in because we like tapas. There you can find a good variety of drinks. They have a good selection of gin tonic , beer and Spanish wine. Regarding food, they had tapas (small portions) and also some main courses dishes. We really enjoyed the place and if we are back in Calgary again, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've visited Barcelona Tavern twice so far. Both times I was blown away by how delicious the food were. I had the lobster ravioli twice (with complimentary brioche) and it was absolutely divine! The tapas were by no means tiny. You can definitely get full from just two dishes if you're here by yourself. Service was really friendly and accommodating. Decor was really cheery inviting. Definitely going to bring people over with me and eat upstairs at the patio for a change. Would definitely recommend coming here for a visit!"}
{"text":"Barcelona is OK.  The food is OK, the service is OK.  If it's close by and location is a premium consideration go for it.  Not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"I guess it's exactly what the name says....a Barcelonian Tavern. It appears to be a great watering hole for groups of office mates. The food is acceptable. The menu isn't overly inspiring but ok so that's it. Passably alright."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat hidden and from now one if I'm going to a Toronto FC match I'll be sure to have an Estrella Damm beer prior to.  Coming to Barcelona Tavern, its got a great chic and contemporary ambiance/ surreal decor almost reminding me of Salvador Dali the famous Spaniard (Or Catalonian) artist.   Upon entering they've got a nice open kitchen, almost tapa/ bar style seating. However due to the hustle and bustle of this place my buddy and I took a chance at the bar and to our luck there were two seats free.  After immediately taking our seats we order our drinks, me with the Estrella and Jacob with the ....umm local brew :)  The seat up of the glass covered rooftop patio is pretty cool, open, airy and great bar seating area and design.  As for food we kept it light, tapas style;  ***Patata Bravas: The worst I've ever had.  I've been to many tapas during my time in Spain predominantly in Communitat de Valencia y Andalusia and these were not the best, perhaps its the unpeeled potatoes (not even partially). Lack of aioli, paprika, garlic, etc...not sure if there was any.   ***Mediterranean wings: The wings were great, sweet with spice, however presentation was not good at all, poor wings looked so lonely on that large white plate. Garnish garnish, people eat with their eyes. Food can be delicious but put a little love in the overall presentation for this dish. Customer service was excellent, hostess and servers were friendl and pleasant. Ambiance 5/5 Food 2.5/5 Service 5/5  I'd come back here for one last time...see you Friday."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Ordered the short rib dip and it was very good. Short rib meat with cheese and crispy onions. All served open faced. Also had the tomato soup and it was just ok. My companion had the Mediterranean grilled sandwich. The sandwich comes with Chorizo sausage in it. She said it was very tasty. She had the fries with her sandwich and the fries were much better than the soup. The service was good."}
{"text":"Went here for a Canada Day dinner to escape from the downpour, and I'm honestly so surprised at some of these negative reviews because my experience was stellar!  It was understandably busy when we walked in, however the wait for a table was under 10 minutes. Our server was really personable and professional, someone who I could tell actually takes pride in her job and providing customers with a great experience, I wish I could remember her name.  I had the flat iron steak sandwich with the parmesan truffle frites and everything was delicious, very different (in a good way) from your typical steak sandwich that's usually just piled with mushrooms. Great flavors. Everyone else at my table devoured their meals as well.   This place looks awesome for a date night or a get together with friends. I noticed they also had a separate private room for functions that looked pretty decent.   I will absolutely 100% return."}
{"text":"Great location. Spacious & modern. Professional servers and good service. Good alcohol selection and interesting menu.  However... Bad food!  We ordered burgers, pizza, and 2 other items. all were greasy and bad. the pizza was wet and soggy.  They need a kitchen to match the other parts. I will give them a 4-5 stars when that happens."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today for lunch and I really enjoyed it. The inside is huge with a lot of seating available, which was perfect as we were a group from work and it can sometimes be hard finding a group table during the lunch hour in the core. I had the Blueberry and Lentil spinach salad with paprika prawns and it was very good."}
{"text":"Came here with colleague and got the Barca Burger (Wagyu beef). WOW high quality meat. Beef was thick. The first bite was ok but it gets better as you bite further in. I am guessing its where they put the sauce. Over flavorful burger. It came with the tomatoes bisque soup. I loved the soup.   I heard their paella are the best. Will have to try that next time.  The atmosphere/ décor is nice.   If you come here with a bigger group, its better to do tapas and just share that."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing slice of heaven. The waitress was simply divine and so helpful. The ambiance was brunch chic with a little splash of sports bar! Most importantly the food was absolutely amazing! Bella was simply amazing and so sweet! I would definitely recommend this place when I return to Canada. They have a lovely option for brunch and a wide array of options for the brunch drinks. The drinks were potent and yummy and the food was to die for!!!! Long live Canada!!!!"}
{"text":"After Gord and I left the Toronto Wolfpack game, we headed to Barcelona Tavern for supper.  They just opened in March ... we'd planned on going a couple times in April but it didn't happen.  They have a large area upstairs that opens onto a patio that was busy ... we sat downstairs.  We ordered some tapas.  We both got Greek Pork Ribs.  They were good.  Crispy and spicy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I'd get these again.  Gord ordered Lobster Ravioli.  He said it was really good and he'd get it again.  I ordered Mediterranean Wings.  They were good ... kind of earthy.  I'd get them again.  James was our server.  He was friendly and helpful and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Friday lunch with my girl Deb...seated quickly by a window at the front of the resto. We arrived at 11:30am but by 12:15 it was completely full and loud. Our server was very helpful and attentive and answered questions we had about the menu.   Since it's a tapas style resto, we shared Greek ribs, patatas bravas, fried machego and split a med pits with string fries.   Manchego was perfectly crusted with salt flakes and not greasy. Patatas were roasted with a half fried egg on top to smear around also yummy. Ribs were my fave! Tender fall off the bone with a good blend of seasoning. We were quite full but had committed to the pita that the kitchen cut in half for us and also left out the tzatziki on mine due to my lactose intolerance. This pita had smoky chicken, tomatoes, arugula, a few unique sauces and a falafel with fries on the side. We were happily stuffed. Would have lived up try the churros but had no room!!!  I really enjoyed it here and will definitely return to try other dishes. Be aware that these small plates aren't that small. Count the number of ribs in the pic and look at the potatoes. Better suited for 3-4 to share but was a lot for the 2 of us. I absolutely could make a meal out of the ribs alone!  With a glass of wine and tea, we split the bill which cane to $35/pp taxes included.   For the service, quality and ambiance, I'd take hubby here for date night or for an upscale client meal."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this spot. The food was the delicious but the service and wait staff were off to say the least ...  Regarding food I order the lobster ravioli and the caesar salad. My friend order the tomato and mozzarella appetizer with the large grain salad. Everything was delicious, and for dessert we had the churros which were \"okay.\"  We shared a pitcher of the popular blood orange sangria which ended up being too sweet and sour for our liking.   It seemed like the restaurant was new and still working out their flow but it felt like the staff was trying to get us to leave @ 9:30pm, even though there was no closing time ... In general it felt like we were an inconvenience to the wait staff who would have rather but hanging out with each other and setting silverware"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the tapas here. We had the chicken empanadas prawn tostadas for starters and they were very good, flavorful but not too spicy. I followed up the tapas with the seafood and chorizo paella. Although the paella was very good I thought it was a little over priced. But I would definitely recommend the tapas and the paella.   Now for the not so good part, our server was not very attentive. It took longer than usual to get our drinks ordered and our food. I had to call her over to take our dinner order. I wouldn't let that discourage anyone from not trying this restaurant but unfortunately our service was not very good."}
{"text":"It was alright . Service wasn't the greatest. Took a while for us to order and even longer to get our bill. It's not even that busy. It's a Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"With some many great spots to go to in Downtown, don't waste your time here.  It wasn't horrible but just not great. Same drinks where different and odd every time your ordered, service was ok but slow as apparently the server staff was understaffed and the food was expensive for what you get.  Spend a week checking out all the great places in Calgary and this came in last in experience and first in expenses.  Hope they improve."}
{"text":"Just getting on its feet.  Brunch - though advertised on the menu - is not actually on offer until some undetermined date. We ordered some tapas with ham but were given bruschetta bread instead as they didn't yet have the Serrano available. The fried cheese is barely distinguishable as Manchego because it's so heavily breaded. The kale and beet salad was ok.   It's at a great location if you're situated in Liberty Village but that's the extent of the appeal."}
{"text":"Considering we are big fans of small plates and flavours, Barcelona Tavern seemed to be an ideal adventure. The place is expansive and very open. No crowded feeling here. The food is simply outstanding and there is a variety of drink choices. Wine list is very good with some great values across the spectrum of the new world in both red and white.   The menu theme is - Mediterranean Inspired and locally infused The menu has some amazing treats like the Veal Bomba and the Greek Ribs, both outstanding in presentation and flavour. Add that to excellent service and this place is a winner. Great social spot to meet up with friends and those looking for a intimate date night with a good vibe."}
{"text":"This place will be one of my favorites in Calgary!!.. Excellent ambience, delicious food, great drinks and good service!.. What else you can ask for??... The sangria was incredible!.. Probably one of the bests in downtown... The food was just amazing.. The octopus was awesome!.. The prawns delicious, the Parmesan potatoes were great!.. The ahi tuna was good was well... Why not 5 stars? .. Because if the manchego  fondue... That was the only thing that was not good... Even when the service was great and they returned it.. I cannot recommend this dish... But everything else was just delicious!!.. I definitely would like to go back to try more things!!..."}
{"text":"Came here for buck a shuck night and it was great.  The after work crowd filled most of the tables which was a good sign.  I prefer the east coast oysters and they came with 3 different mignonettes, which were all tasty.  We also had the pulled pork slammers, veals bombas, and roasted cauliflower.  The slammers were very good.  Nothing outrageous but still really good.   I don't go downtown to eat that often but Barcelona was a great choice!"}
{"text":"Love this place for their gin and tapas. Tried a couple of their gins and the lemon and ginger was a favorite of mine. Tried a couple of their tapas, the bomba was really good as well as their scallop and pork belly. Going to be my go-to place when you want to enjoy a glass of really good gin. Definitely coming back again here soon!!!"}
{"text":"Decided on the Short Rib Dip with Kale Salad today.  Really good dish!  The Short Rib sat on top of a bun.  The meat was so tender with that melted cheese on a bun.  At the bottom of the bun, there was some white and creamy horseradish sauce.  On top of the bun, you have a good heaping of thinly sliced deep-fried onions.  Cut a chunk of your SRD and then dip into the au jus.  Delicious!  The Kale Salad was very fresh; there was pieces of cauliflower, quinoa, thin slice of cucumber, fresh, green kale and a nice creamy salad dressing.   My friend had the same sandwich but with matchstick fries; comes with ketchup.  She liked her dish, too!  Well put together dish!  The only little problem was the green tea.  The water was not hot enough for my tea.  The waitress changed it out and it was all good!"}
{"text":"Brunch in Liberty Village is always a mission if you don't have any reservations. So after wandering around, we were drawn into Barcelona Tavern with it's delicious aromas & 2-floored airy space!  //BRUNCH// Eggs Benedict - It had prosciutto on 2 PERFECTLY poached eggs drizzled with creamy hollandaise sauce, which was all on top of Chorizo sausages. They were so lovely for allowing me to substitute the tater tots for a kale beet salad (no extra cost) and have the Eggs Benny on top of a bed of arugula instead of an English Muffin.   It looks like they're still coming up with their full menu so we had a fairly limited selection for their brunch dishes. They said their FULL brunch menu (which looks SO enticing) will be available by the end of June.   //SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE// 5 out of 5. The staff are very friendly, attentive, and I believe it was a male manager who took our brunch orders and he was super accommodating to my salad substitutions on my Eggs Benedict.  The art work along the stairs was also very fun and I loved the tall window ceilings on the 2nd floor!  I'll definitely come back later in the summer to brunch at Barcelona again!"}
{"text":"In my last review I commented on the service, how it was on the slower side and could use improvement. Unfortunately, service was as inconsistent as my first visit. As friendly as our server was, she left us for 30 minutes before taking our order. However food did come out pretty fast. But then when we were finished eating, our plates never got cleared and stayed there on our table, which was awhile as we stayed and chatted catching up with each other. Server never came back to check on us or ask us if we wanted more drinks after our meal. It wasn't until we were ready to leave when a few of us had to ask if some of our food could get packed up. So again, lovely venue, tasty food (ordered the calamari, truffle fries, and grilled cheese) but so-so service. The prices are on the higher side, so being on point with service would make the dining experience all the more worth while."}
{"text":"Meh, coffee.the snacks are clearly not made in house and  the service is walk up. I stopped in looking for a quick bite to eat sort of turned around almost immediately. I understand lunch and Dinner to be a better choice here I will have to revisit this locale."}
{"text":"Came here after a loud and busy evening down the street at another bar.   This place is swanky and has great decor - love the mismatched chairs.   We came just before the kitchen was closing, but luckily our server snuck in our order of churros just in time.   I loved their selection of gin and tonics - I went with the strawberry mint and it was spectacular both visually and taste-wise.   The churros came out nice and warm with two dips - a dulce de leche and chocolate.   They were amazingly delicious, I definitely will be back again to try their tapas."}
