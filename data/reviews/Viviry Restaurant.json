{"text":"The food is very good. Perfect for just a casual night out with family or friends. This place serves pastas, pizza, fish and chips, grilled meats etc... The service is very fast and the staff is very friendly as well. This place is perfect for a quick night out to eat. Nothing fancy. But good for what it is."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were looking for something late night and I will tell you we couldn't have lucked out more. The food was all delicious. We had french onion soup and split a viviry special. Everything was hot and fresh and really quick. I also had a cosmo, which I was reluctant to do since it was a restaurant not a bar, but it was delicious as well and perfectly mixed. More important than the food, all the staff was very attentive and friendly, especially considering that it was late on a friday night. You should be prepared for the fact that there is no parking, and also the place is a little run down and outdated on the inside but definitely worth the short walk for such great service and delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant médiocre. Nous étions huit, et six se sont plaints. Mon épouse n'a pas été capable de terminer son plat de manicotti avec épinards, la sauce était trop sucrée et la pasta était cuit inégalement. Mon spaghetti avait la même sauce sucrée."}
{"text":"The pizza feels and tastes cheap. Apparently they use sauce from a can.  It's not terrible but there are better options in the area"}
