{"text":"Un bon apportez votre vin. Leur bibimbap est délicieux! La version végétarienne tout comme celle au buf. Le viande est excellente, tendre et goûteuse. Lorsqu'ils servent le tout, le plat frétille comme une assiette de fajitas et reste chaud tout au long de la dégustation. La sauce piquante relève vraiment bien le tout. N'hésitez pas à en redemander! Vous pouvez demander l'uf cru si vous désirez plutôt en faire une sauce en le mélangeant à votre plat!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! The atmosphere is great, the restaurant is small but well decorated. And the washooms have the neatest sinks! The food here is AMAZING! Be ready for some well seasoned and somtimes pretty spicy dishes! When I went I had thier  chicken wings as an appetizer, they have ruined all other wings for me because I do not think there are better wings out there! I also had the spicy chicken stir fry which was noting short of absolutely delicious! The food also came with some sides of Kim chi, some sort of pickle and bean sprouts in a sesame oil, all very delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Server was very friendly and helpful . The food is reasonable priced , I would recommend getting one of the prefix options , caution it is a lot of food . The food was tasty and close to authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday and I was the only person in the restaurant which is surprising since other times I've passed by the place was packed.  Possibly the pedestrian street next to the restaurant is taking away from their business... anyhow regardless, I was here to eat and I was hungry! The restaurant itself has a bit of modern feel to it and tastefully decorated. Above all it seemed to be very clean and organized including the kitchen, which we could see right into at the back of the space.  Asides from other meal choices, this resto offers the option to build your own bibimbap by choosing the type of rice, protein, vegetables and sauce (spicy please!)... but since my focus was the bibimbap that will be all I will cover in this review.  Since this was my first time at this Korean resto I went for a classic version of the beef bibimbap, to allow me to compare to my previous experiences in other restaurants. Holy cow! This was heaven on a plate or should I say bowl. Everything was so fresh and tasty, the beef was perfectly seasoned, the kimchee had an amazing flavour profile. All in all, I was totally blown away as this instantly became my fave Korean in town! The lunch deal cost around 10 bucks for a soup, the bibimbap and kimchee, nice ! Good value and good times. Service was also very quick and friendly so I'll be back for sure.... probably soon as I am already lusting for another bowl of goodness."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Left the place pleasantly satiated!"}
{"text":"Arrivés là par hasard, on a tous trouvé ça très bon et très original! Ne loupez pas les crêpes à l'oignon vert en entrée!"}
{"text":"Excellent petit restaurant \"apportez votre vin\"!  Des plats qui sont généreux et orginaux.  Le bibimbap, notamment, est absolument délicieux: la viande est tendre, le riz est succulent, les légumes cuits à la perfection,  les saveurs variés et riches.  Seuls bémols, qui lui coûtent sa 5e étoile: L'ambiance musicale, composée de musique pop à la mode, gâte un peu le plaisir.  Ça et les baguettes en plastique..."}
