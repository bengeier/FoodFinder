{"text":"Wow very surprised to see a great quality food in a food court , very tasty Barbacoa and guacamole !!!!! Wow"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sonoran Combo with the bacon wrapped hot dog and corn on the cob. The staff clearly doesn't care about quality control. The bun was as hard as a rock. How the employee was able to grab that bun, feel how hard it was and then continue to pass it off to a customer is beyond me. The dog tasted like it had been sitting there all day, same goes for the corn. Absolutely the worst mall food I've ever had which is saying something."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Quesadilla. The chicken was great! Good seasoning. I had sour cream & salsa as toppings. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Warning! Dangerous food safety. Had the three chicken combo. They just opened for the day. Beans and rice are literally cold. Which means they take them from the refrigerator and put them in the steam table to heat. It is not a safe practice and the food just grows bacteria instead of reaching safe heat temperatures.  Going in the trash #unsafefoodhandling"}
{"text":"The Sonoran hot dog attracted me....until I saw how it was prepared. The server bounced between preparing the food and taking the money at the register. Yes, she had gloves on, but it defeats the purpose to touch filthy, germ-infested money only to turn around and touch the food. What's amazing to me is that people in line saw this, yet said nothing! Gross factor = 10+."}
{"text":"My experience here was not very good I ordered a sonoran hot dog and the bread was extremely hard. I also got an elote and it was cold. My friend got a burrito and he said that was really good."}
{"text":"I loved the carnitas bowl. Their salsa is quite flavourful. Nice seating area in mall."}
{"text":"The build your own burrito is fresh, tasty and big enough to share. The staff is great."}
{"text":"I was really apprehensive to try this place, especially since this restaurant is owed by the same Villa Franchise that owns most of the other restaurants in the food court ( I haven't had much luck with the other Villa restaurants, especially that disappointingly tiny Mo' Burger 20 steps away but that's another review). Anyway, back to Tinta the service here is a little on the slower side but the food is worth the wait. I had the shredded pork tacos and they were the BOMB! I topped the tacos with about half of the topping bar and was in heaven. I will say, I wish they doubled up on the tortillas because corn tortillas split easily. The pork was so moist and tender and the hot salsa lended itself nicely to the mix. My sister had the tacos and the Elote (she blasted through it in all in less than 10 minutes). I can't wait to come back to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Wow! Honestly walking up I was expecting meh mall food like many of the reviews but I was completely wrong.  The burrito I had may just have been the best burrito I've had at any restaurant on any level.  Very impressed!  I most certainly will be a returning guest here!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the girls were more worried about cleaning the sauce bar than serve our tacos, never again go there!!! Dont waste your money!! The customer service and the food HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Today I made a venture into the newly renovated food court of Arizona Mills. Of course I bypassed the salad bar and  shocking to even myself the Froyo place and went straight for what I was hoping to be the spicy selection at Tinta Mexicana. I quickly checked over their list of items, tacos, burritos, and bowls a bit limited but hey it's mall food. Upon first glance I was thinking this is just another Chipotle in disguise, but Tinta Mexicana has something they do not, Bacon wrapped Hot Dogs! Need I say anymore? I got the Sonoran, but did it my way. I just could not see a tasty bacon dog smothered in mayo, ketchup and mustard as the menu suggested. You have your choice of brown or black beans, and onion mixed with cilantro. I skipped the onion cilantro mix, as to spare others upon my return to the office. Now if they had cilantro alone, I would have gone for it. I asked to replace my condiments with their spicy salsa, of which was not spicy at all but still flavorful. The service was a bit slow on the uptake, but they are fairly new and perhaps still working the kinks out. All in all for around $4.50, a pretty good deal. I'll be back, I mean c'mon they've got Bacon!"}
{"text":"Short story: I wasn't impressed with Tinta Mexicana.
I came here when I saw they had Sonoran hot dogs. They advertise that it comes with certain ingedients, like a normal Sonoran dog would. They needed to cook a new dog so I waited away from the counter until she called my husband over to customize the dog. I realized after he came back that she didn't make the dog as advertised, just put on the beans and salsa I preferred. No ketchup, mustard or mayo. Whatever, I'll get over it. I took a bite and it was gross. The bun, which was soggy from the beans, was stale and the beans were old. I ended up taking it apart and eating it like a salad."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The service guy taking the order serving the food used a scale that was previously dirty and used the chicken I asked for to measure the chicken. I approached him and I said. Are you going to wash that scale ? He replied do you want me to. Of course, so he rinsed the scale and dumped the cold chicken. His approach was that he was too busy. I replied, it's a health safety hazard. This place should have their restaurant grade re-evaluated. Talk about contamination.
Horrible food and service"}
{"text":"Good ingredients and great flavor. Considering this is mall food it definitely beats other something-bertos around the area. I had the marinated chicken and added also grilled onions and guacamole. I was not disappointed. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I truly don't know what was worse the food or the service. They young girls serving seemed completely annoyed that you were there and were unfriendly for every part of the transaction. Food was terrible. Beef was tough and flavorless. Rice was cold and lacked even salt. Tasted like wet cold cardboard. Everything was very mediocre. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"If you are in the Arizona Mills mall food area and craving Mexican cuisine this would be the place to check out! The menu has street tacos, burritos, elote, rice , beans, etc. For lunchtime I had the three chicken street tacos, rice and black beans special . The tacos with a drink included under 10 bucks ! I was thoroughly impressed with the fresh flavors that didn't feel heavy and just lean enough to go on with my work day!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see they offered a Sonoran style hot dog. Tasted okay but definitely not even close to what a Sonoran style is supposed to be. Avoid it if you have had the real thing. For example, they just use a large regular hot dog bun. Couldn't even bother to get the bread right.

Okay in a pinch."}
{"text":"They're  just rude and the food is overpriced for what it is.. there was this lady that was tatted on the arm and she was skinny just talking shit as she was walking away and when I asked what she was saying she gonna act like she didn't hear me. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Ok tried this place for first time.... it was edible, nothing spectacular.  Employees didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Will not come back again"}
{"text":"For a fast Mexican food, this place was really good. I had the pollo asado bowl. With advacado, pineapple pico, rice and beans, cilantro.  I thought it was better than Chipotle. They had crema and Mexican queso.  And they cook right there on the grill. It was a bit over priced hence the 4 stars.  But I liked it."}
{"text":"Talk about terrible. Goodness. I came here because my co-workers kept raving about it so I finally decided to try it. Well it's extremely hard to order when the person behind the counter doesn't speak English. She understood Carnitas quesadilla, aaaand that was about it. While pointing and using exaggerated words I got the lady to understand \"sour cream\". Then I tried to tell her \"mild salsa\". Omg, what a headache. After saying \"mild\" eight times she then started pointing to the different salsas and I said, \"I don't know which one is the mild.\" Not sure why I said it, she didn't understand it. She then said, \"Hot?\" I gestured with my fingers and said, \"little hot.\" It was enough to get some salsa into a little to-go cup. Holy hell. This wouldn't have bothered me as much if I were in some hole in the wall Mexican joint where I know the food is amazing because the recipes are being passed down the generations. But that wasn't the case, I was in a mall for crying out loud! 

So I get back to work and open my food. It's dripping, literally, with grease. In fact, it was so greasy that the aluminum paper stuff holding it together tore when I tried to pick it up. I couldn't even stomach eating the last piece. They barely put any Carnitas or cheese in the quesadilla, and they didn't put any of the grilled onions that should have been there either. I paid $7 for this awful Carnitas quesadilla and it didn't come with a drink or sides. 

So overall this was truly terrible. I will not be going back. Take your money to a Chipotle since that's who they're trying to copy, or try a different eatery in Az Mills."}
{"text":"Expected better. Bland flavors for Mexican food. Weak service."}
{"text":"I had the pork tacos with pineapple tomato salsa.  Pleasantly surprised for mall food.  The man in front of me got a burrito the size of a small  automobile for $6.99"}
{"text":"I was just looking for a snack to eat while walking around the mall and thank God I found this place!! I picked up the guac and chips. This was 3 weeks ago and I've been thinking about it ever since. I'm looking forward to trying more from this place on my next trip to the mall. I hope they stick around, they are yummy and the customer service was warm and friendly. I think the guac and chips was around $3. 

Good work guys, I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I was dissatisfied coming here because, there was no welcome or greeting the first words I heard while in line was what do you want. Although no line behind me employees were impolite and in a rush to get my order taken and out of the way. Food quality was poor due to lack or preparation and proper cooking times and after repeatedly saying what I did not want on my order I was charged for extra sides of items and when I explained I didn't want nor did I receive the items I was charged for they refused to refund me because my order had already been rang up and they also charges me $2 for a small water cup.2 stars because the elote was delicious!"}
{"text":"In theory, it's kind of like Chipotle, but it's in a mall food court. You pick a burrito or a bowl and they fill it with your toppings of choice. They even have an extended selection of toppings that Chipotle is lacking, like pickled cabbage.

My experience was less than spectacular though. Rice was crunchy, chicken was cold and veggies were likely sitting on that steam table all day. Super disappointed. Maybe if you go in at the beginning of the lunch rush you'll get fresh food. I was stuck with the leftovers I guess. 

Bleh."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the many negative reviews of Tinta. I went here for lunch and thought it was fairly good and the amount of food I got was substantial for the price. I got a bowl with rice and beans, the pulled pork and beef, hot salsa, cilantro, grilled jalapeno, cheese.... it was spicy and tasty. The bowl cost around 7$. It was certainly better than most food court meals. If I were in Arizona Mills, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"The food here was awful, I noticed that their seasoning is loaded with tenderizer and that had me in a state of distress all night.... lets just say i couldnt leave the bathroom. I am hispanic and enjoy my Mexican, but this joint sucked. I had cramps and stomach pains all night. Do not give children this food.... have mercy."}
