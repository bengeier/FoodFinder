{"text":"Tasty gyro. Cheep and cheerful.

Messini's is right next door.  2x we didn't get a table at Messini's because they were packed.  Decided to give this place a try even though they weren't busy at all and the place looked like a dive.  

I was surprised by the food.  Decent quality and huge portion.  My chicken was a little dry but it was the end of the day so maybe it wasn't necessarily the best time to go.  It was still tasty and for $5 you can't really go wrong.  Portion was huge.  I was quite full.  

Owner was friendly enough.  Not very talkative but really nice to us.  

I would definitely go back if I was in the neighborhood.  I would go to Messini's for a real sit down but if you're looking for a quick place to eat this place is just fine."}
{"text":"This place is a little sketchy-looking but they make a mean gyro and for good value ($5)."}
{"text":"Opted to wander in here with my discerning hole in the wall conisseur boyfriend for lunch before doing some touristy stuff around toronto.  He loves passing up stuff that looks good in favor of an excellent meal.  

He nailed it.  

We split a large Greek salad and had a lamb and beef gryo on pita each, and if this isn't food that will change your life, you are dead inside.  The meat had this delicious, thick herb crust, and the French fries and tzatziki thrown in the pita were the perfect accompaniments.  It's obvious the owner has spent many years perfecting this.  So do yourself and your gullet a favor and stop here, eat the food, and be glad a man like this exists.  I'm tempted to stop and buy his bulk food before we head back to Rochester in a few days, because this doesn't exist there.

Thank you Louis!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  This is my kind of place; laid back, not overpriced and full of flavour. 

Very friendly staff and I will gladly go back."}
{"text":"I live in the area. I've had gyros from nearly every Greektown restaurant that has them. This is my favourite gyro spot. The meat is absolutely perfect(though 1/10 of the time it's really salty) and the serving is very generous (only other place that gave more meat was folia back in its heyday). It also happens to be the cheapest gyro you can find around here. Pork, chicken, lamb, beef - you can't go wrong. The other great part of this place is the hard-working cook, Mary. She has her bad days but usually is just a star and treats you like you're her own baby. Skip the dry, bland, over-hyped gyros at messini's and hit up Louis - you will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place is soooo delicious!!  Louis is our favourite spot for a low-key dinner on the Danforth.  I don't eat pork, lamb, and beef, so it's great that they have chicken gyros - amazing!!  The greek fries are also d-lish!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite finds in Toronto!  Not fancy at all, even feels a little old school, but the food is damn good.

Pros:
Good food - the gyros, chicken souvlaki, tzatziki, and especially the Greek Fries
Great prices - you leave feeling full for an awesome price
Great location on the Danforth

Cons:
If you don't have patience when ordering, than this might not be the place for you (but I suggest having patience, because it is worth it)
The decor might deter you if you are a fancy person
If you need to use the washroom, going to the back in the tiny bathroom might freak you out 

I've been here many times and will be back.  I love the odd personality of the place and I just can't stay away from the Greek Fries (so good!).  Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Straight up nothing fancy about this place but who needs that anyways. I want good food. I've walked by many times especially in the summer time and it smelled so good. Finally, one day I tried it.

Boom. Its good. Its tasty. Its a good price. I'm referring to the Gyros of course. Heck just writing this makes me want to go back to eat more. You guys should try it for yourselves

Later folks."}
{"text":"My go-to spot when I head to Danforth Music Hall for a show. I wondered in here once and can't stop coming back. Mari, the lady who seems to run the place (she's there every time I'm in), is high-energy, generous, kind, eccentric and attentive. I always go for the beef & lamb gyro and am never disappointed with the quality of the food or the portion size. Admittedly I don't know a lot about Greek food or know how authentic this is, but the atmosphere, generous portions and tasty eats are enough to earn repeat visits. If I'm ever running late to a show and can't make it here first, I actually get bummed to break tradition and not be able to indulge. Loui's forever!"}
{"text":"If only the hungry hordes cramming into Messini next-door would stop and give the lil' guy a shot. They would not be disappointed.

I have tried both, back-to-back, and Louis is the undeniable winner here. Funny enough, as I was doing this with my partner, a young couple with baby had done the same, and also agreed that Louis knocked the socks off his bigtime next-door neighbour. Not only is this place the real deal - take one look at the guy making your gyro and you can tell this is his god-given craft - but everything from the light fluffy pita, to the juicy meats, to the crisp dressings, and that certain 'je ne sais quoi' (but in Greek), all for incredible value. 

Pick one up to go and eat it in the nearby square, and by Zeus, you're as good as gold."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been going here for quite a while. The food is generally amazing, they give huge portions and it tastes delicious. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because every once and awhile I've had bad luck where the meat has tasted off (only happened once and I didn't get food poisoning or anything). Also it is incredibly creasy, sometimes too much so. Get the beef and lamb, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going to this place thinking it *might* be anywhere near as good as Messini, and was horribly wrong. Got a pork gyro and the meat was under cooked, and barely seasoned. The tzatziki tasted like yogurt with a slightly garlic hint. Bottom line: don't go  here for a gyro, especially when Messini is literally right next door!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite gyro spots.  I usually get the lamb gyro.  Will try a couple meat sticks next time.  Although they are right beside Messini's I alternate between the two.  Really nice staff."}
{"text":"The gyros are delicious and the staffs character adds quality flavor to every bite of the succulent juicy pork and chicken that lies within the flourly love blanket that is the pita."}
{"text":"I have only come here to buy meat, which is okay. The thing about this place is that if you don't know what you're doing they will try to give you the worst cuts of meat, which are shockingly full of fat, and overcharge you. So if you go there, know what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Great Great Great Gyro in a little hole in the wall kinda place, right next to another even more famous Gyro place (Messini). Well Louis is just as good and even more authentic. You get a huge amount of fries in the Gyro and they do a great cut of both Beef and Lamb. The Greek fries were also great and served as  thin fried chips rather than traditional fries. Yum Yum Yum.

The best part was my buddies who dragged me there had already had their dinner there and one was hungry enough to eat yet another massive Gyro when we returned. !"}
{"text":"Never had their gyros here but we come here often to buy the souvlaki for BBQs.  Both the pork and the chicken are amazing!  2.50 per skewer and there is a LOT of meat on every skewer.  Buy 11 get 1 free!  I also LOVE their tzatziki!"}
{"text":"Louis' Meat Market is yet another childhood favorite of mine. I've been coming here for quite some time now and my week is never really complete unless I stop by and say hi to Mary.

The place itself is not the most modern-looking establishment on the Danforth, but it almost gives you that comforting feeling of a mom-and-pop shop. Everything is here is pretty cheap and very fresh. I usually come by to pick up a dozen sticks of the chicken souvlaki. They're very tender and so flavorful. I take them home and grill them since it's good for when you have company over. If you buy a dozen, you get one free! You can also buy tzatziki there (they make amazing tzatziki), pitas, as well as lamb, pork, and beek souvlaki. 

When I'm feeling a little lazy, I usually come by for dinner and just pick up a heap of greek fries. Tell Mary to make them extra crispy! It's super yummy that way. She loves to load the feta cheese on top as well. 

I love coming by and Mary is just the sweetest old lady on earth (next to my great grandma). The old man might scare you at times, but he doesn't bite haha."}
{"text":"Mmmm.  They have some greasy flavourful gyros and greek fries.  I mean when we're talking fatty and sinful glutinous, this is a good place to get that fix after partying.  I know their neighbours tend to get a lot of business cause its a sit down, and well better presentation and more presence in terms of branding, but I've come to Louis many times when I used to work in the area, and its a legit craving place.  Sometimes Ive gone to other gyro places, and though they are branded better, louis is more flavourful gyros.  Also, they have this potato dish that one of the guys cooks there all the time on the side, and its incredible."}
{"text":"Fantastic gyros. Best in Toronto for sure. If you go in and are polite and know what you want the woman there is the nicest person in the world but if you rub her the wrong way she's basically the soup nazi. Adds to some of the charm of the place though."}
{"text":"If you don't mind getting called \"my darling\" by a lady with the most gravelly voice I've ever heard who gives her 110% in terms of service in a delightfully casual way while serving fresh Greek food in a grungy diner-esque setting, this is the place for you. I read the yelp reviews and knew I should get gyros, but I only wanted a snack, and I didn't want to pay $6+ so I could just get a box of gyros and tzatziki.

I ended up ordering the pork souvlaki for $3.99. Or it could have been $3.50. I forget. Oh well. When it was ready, I wanted it on the stick to take a picture. She insisted on taking it out for me and she told me she'd make it real nice for me. She didn't know I was trying to take a picture. I think she just thought I was really hungry. My $3.99 ish snack ended up being a fairly generous portion of tender pork souvlaki, a handful of fries, a few slices of tomato, and a small container of tzatziki. Can you beat that price? I can't think of another time I've had Greek food this cheap. I'm tickled pink."}
{"text":"If you want a quality Gyros straight from Greece with the fries included, this is the place.

$4.75 for Pork/chicken/beef and lamb gyros!

This is a take out joint.  I will go back."}
{"text":"These are the kind of food finds I live for.... the small, unassuming ,  unattractive  looking hole in the wall type of place, I cannot claim I found this on my own, my Greek friend gave me the insider scoop.

You go inside this place and by sight you may initially want to leave , but stop.....smell.... stare at the large spinning log of pork cooking in the open kitchen area  at the front. Then do yourself a favor, order a pork gyro.

Yes the lady working there seems slightly crazy, but know what else is crazy ,  that pork gyro you are about to eat. One bite into this thing and if my review brought you to this place your mind will literally say....\"thank you Adam W\"

I'm not even giving you more detailed information ,  you need to do this for your own good, then thank me later.....

Ps. You're welcome"}
{"text":"Pita burnt, fatty meat, interior dirty, cook very pushy. 
Stomach hurts... Would not return"}
{"text":"OMG, the greek fries are so so so so good!

they are thinly sliced and fried, also to a consistency of chips, and topped with a generous amount of feta and some tangy (vinegar) I think.  

I had them once, then I had them again, and I've been dreaming of them all week.  I'm going back.  Soon.

It's delicious."}
{"text":"Louis' is a restaurant that offers fast-food style Greek sandwiches/pitas.  I have no idea if the bathroom is accessible because I've never stayed long enough to use it.  I normally go to Louis' when I want a take-out chicken souvlaki on a pita.  I prefer Louis' to its neighbour, Messini.  I don't think there are ANY vegetarian or vegan options other than maybe french fries?  

If you're on the Danforth and looking for a quick, cheap, souvlaki pita that has meat, try Louis; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has the best and the cheapest Greek food you will ever have, no contest.

The portions are MASSIVE compared to messini and Alexandros as well as cheaper, I can't remember exactly but gyros are between $4-$5 depending on the meat you choose (my favorite and personal recommendation is pork) and the Greek salad as well as Greek fries are $4 or less. The Gyros are huge and the meat is fresh, not that sausage blend gyro crap that some places serve, this is fresh, real meat on a spit that you can see rotating behind the counter. The gyros are stuffed with massive amounts of meat, onion, lettuce and even french fries. Its warm and everything and delicious beyond description.

The greek fries are similar in size and in quality.

I have been to Alexandros and messini and they don't even come close to the food at Louis meat market, by far the best gyros on the danforth.

Edit: I was in here, stayed after closing time to watch the president's address live right after they shot Bin laden. History happens here."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of gyros, however I was in the neighbourhood and heard good things about this place.  It didn't disappoint!  I ordered the gyro dinner, and was pleasantly surprised at the HUGE serving, and reasonable price.  The lady who served me was a hoot, and the food was efficiently prepared.  I would definitely return to this place if looking for an inexpensive take-out meal. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent souvlaki and gyros prepared in store by Louis for over 40 years.   Tziki home made and salads always fresh and plentiful.   The main reason I go to Louis is Marianthi who is always happy and loves to make customers feel welcome with a smile or even a little dance.  The restaurant is small and could have a makeover  but the service and food make up for the decor."}
{"text":"Pork gyro on a pita. Pita bread and tatziki were the best part. Pork was cooked well done a bit dry but fatty, wasn't that good. Didn't really sit well after I ate it.  I wanted to like it, I love little hole in the wall places. I don't recommend it. It might have been a bad day."}
{"text":"This place was very sketchy from it's looks. But as they say never judge a book by it's cover. This is the most authentic tasting gyro restaurant I've been to. It reminded me of being back home in Greece. Portion size, flavour, preparation, it had it all. Highly highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a gyros dinner with double meat and a large order of Greek fries. They actually offered to replace the rice and potatoes that come with the dinner with the Greek fries to save me money. It was a great idea and very much appreciated as I didn't really need all that food. I had to order the Greek fries as so many people on yelp said how tasty they were which is absolutely true! The Greek fries are actually more like homemade potato chips than fries which makes them even better. food is delicious and great value. I already knew the lady at the counter's name was Mary as she was mentioned by a number of other reviewers. She is very friendly, helpful, has a lot of character and is entertaining while you wait for your food. she suggested I have a seat while I waited and I explained that she was too entertaining to sit down."}
{"text":"We went here because the Greek place next door was packed. Glad we did! The food was really yummy and the portions were huge. The service was great, too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has me coming back every time I'm up on the Danforth and looking for a cheap and delicious meal. On occasion I have even found myself taking the subway up here just for the gyro! I love how cheap this place is, and I love how great the food is here. 

This is such a tiny little place, that doesn't look like much from the outside, and once inside you know you're not at a fine dining restaurant, but I think they put more effort into their food than they do into the upkeep of their restaurant, and I'm okay with that. There are so many places to grab a gyro on this strip, including a much fancier (and a bit more expensive) place next door, but this one is by and far your better option. 

The people here are very nice and pleasant to deal with. They serve beer, which comes as a bit of a surprise, based on the type of place it is. I will continue to go back to this place over and over because I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"You can read all the other reviews and know that the owner is great, friendly and cares about you. I agree entirely, all her customers are very comfortable and enjoy their time here. She even gets cool drinks left for her by people passing by. 40 years I think it was?

The food was good. The souvlaki is juicy and great, as well as the tzatziki sauce but what is especially great was the price - $10.50 compared to the usual $13-$15 charged at other restaurants. What's the catch? Well it's a really small place and it might take you a while depending on how many people are in line ahead of you (it's a one-person show!).

The potato and rice ended up swimming and the rice ended up mushy. The take-out container had no divisions, so the sauce the potatoes were in ended up coating the salad as well. Lots of feta cheese on the salad though, gotta love that!

Next time I come, I'd like to try gyros (with double meat). I watched enviously as other customers ordered it, sometimes two, sometimes with double meat and they all definitely looked good. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Was craving a Gyro and wanted something authentic. This place is a must if you want quality and quantity. Everything is made to order and flavoured perfectly. They accept debit but prefer cash. Best gyro I've ever had."}
{"text":"My co-worker is Greek and lives in the Danforth, I asked for her favorite gyro spot and she said Louise Meat Market is the place to eat. I couldn't agree more! Good food, good size portions and reasonable price. I had the gyro combo with lamb, my husband had the chicken we ate every last bite. I'll definitely be back and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants some excellent Greek food and isn't preoccupied with ambiance."}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged by its hole-in-the-wall appearance. We had the pork gyros on a pita and they were fantastic. There were  a few fatty chunks throughout the gyros, however, they were easy to eat around and trust me, the portion is HUGE so even with picking you will struggle to finish your gyros! 

Price was great - less than $6 for the magnificent monstrosity."}
{"text":"The nine of us very hungry Food Appreciation Team members (FAT) stampeded into the Louis Meat Market. The owner warms your heart. She is kind, generous, and somehow managed to run the place on her own the night we visited. She even gave us a plate of free Greek fries to share. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Louis Meat's Greek Fries, it is freshly fried chips topped with feta cheese. Highly addictive! Not good for weight management related new year resolutions. 

My partner in crime and I shared a chicken souvlaki wrap ($4.75), complete with yogurt sauce, grilled chicken souvlaki, lettuces and tomato. Massive portion! I struggled to finish my 1/2 of the wrap. The chicken unfortunately was slightly dry. Our friends enjoyed their gyros thoroughly. Most says they will visit again! 

Great value, friendly environment, full belly, warm soul - good times!"}
{"text":"They are lying about their prices salad 6.5 on the board, when I ordered it they tell me 10 dollars and then charged me 14 dollars. For medium salad with bad veggies and 4 small scews they are charging 32 dollars."}
