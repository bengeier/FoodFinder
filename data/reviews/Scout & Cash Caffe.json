{"text":"Excellent Eggs Benedict with sides of hashbrowns and a salad. Great tasting coffee and a friendly attentive staff in a relaxed atmosphere. One of the hidden gems of the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Scout and Cash took a reservation for our rather large party, despite occupying half the venue, and were very gracious and responsive when communicating with them. The prices were average for the type of meal but the potion was large and presentation was very classy. The servers were attentive given our party size as well, so overall our party very  much enjoyed our meal there. The coffee cups were a bit small for my taste but of course refills were available."}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfasts I've had in the city---my over cooked omelette was accompanied with under cooked potatoes, a sprig of poorly washed salad and meagre side of cheap bacon all for the sum $13."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this little neighbourhood/local cafe, but my latte was not made well. In a few seconds, all the milk froth was gone and I was left with a really awful tasting liquid that I didn't even finish it. The Nutella croissants that everyone raves about - flies flying all around. No cake plate cover to cover them up! I think the barista needs more training too. Takes 6-7 minutes to make a drink. Two stars for the nice decor but damn, worst first impression."}
{"text":"Scout & Cash is a tiny cafe that is a friendly neighborhood place to grab a latte!
It's popular for those in the area.  The owner was super cool and he knew most of his customers that stopped by.

With only a few tables, he was very nice about letting us hang out at the cafe one afternoon to study.  

There are some brunch items such as Italian Toast (It's like French toast but well, made by an Italian).   I had the home-made vegetable soup with pita chips that really hit the spot!

This is a cute coffee shop and they are hoping to have a small patio where they can serve alcohol. 

If you are in the area, this is a great place to stop by for your espresso fix!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food and amazing panini sandwiches. And omg please try the mimosas they will change your life. I am coming back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing coffee, great brunch and great service. You can't go wrong if you just need a cup of brew or want a full out meal. Try one of the Kale Smoothies by Owl & Goose, they are great before or after a workout!"}
{"text":"Such a perfect spot for a casual coffee or cozy chat w friends. Pricing is great for the quality of the products. My Americano had a wonderful  flavour and perfect bite. Owner is very chill and welcoming. The music playing throughout day is a great selection of the owners iPod playlist which is super mellow. Lovely neighbourhood spot to check out. It's one of a kind these days."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Stopped in after Wychwood Market for a coffee to go but their friendly and welcoming vibe had me chilling here for an hour. 
Service is personable and friendly and their Americano Misto is the best I've had in months. If I may say, it's the best in the area. 
Tables around me ordered brunch and it all looks delicious. 
Check it out!"}
{"text":"You have your coffee, beer, brunch, TV, Dad jams, but the real star of the show is the terrific owner. He is genuinely warm with all of his customers; he's also charming and handsome. What more could you want from a neighbourhood spot?"}
{"text":"Wow! I rate this joint. As someone who is quite fussy and particular about her coffee I was pleasantly surprised how this place served it bang on. FYI I'm a soy flat white kinda gal and my perfect cup is just the right combination of nearly-too-strong and nearly-too-hot and a totally smooth finish. Bang on. Positioned on a cute little corner swing by this gem on the way to Fiesta Farms!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with fresh pastries and really friendly staff. Would have liked to see some more breakfast items on offer but for a casual drop in coffee shop, Scout is Cash."}
{"text":"Excellent lattes, delicious food and friendly service. Such a great little coffee shop. A neighborhood gem."}
