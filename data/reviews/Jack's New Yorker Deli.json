{"text":"Finding lunch uptown on a Sunday can be tough - but this is a delicious oasis that I plan on returning to.   I'm from NY so I take delis very seriously - and obviously, so does the (incredibly nice) owner. Every sandwich comes with a side (fresh cut fries, vinegar-based pasta salad, etc - and can upgrade to soup or salad) and a fountain drink. It's almost all less than $10.   The white bean chicken chili, topped with Fritos, was incredibly good. I went with a chicken Reuben for my sandwich and was pleasantly surprised at how great it was. French fries are fresh and - my fave - they have malt vinegar on the tables.   The space is beautiful. Tons of windows and TVs. Would be a good space to bring work (as some people were today). Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My sandwich was perfect and crew was awesome.  I think I have found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Finally a great place on the north end of Tryon!  This place has a huge menu with excellent food at reasonable prices - and everything comes with a side and a drink.  The homemade soup is particularly delicious.  The service is excellent - incredible for a quick service restaurant.    The space has been renovated and has plenty of comfortable nooks, large windows, and big TVs.   I couldn't recommend it more."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Staff working was nice.  We were the only people in the restaurant at 5:30 pm.   We used a Go Play and Save coupon........sandwiches come with a side unless you use a coupon.  If you use a coupon you are charged extra for the side. Staff called someone,  the owner or manager and she stated the additional charge applied although the side is included with the sandwich.  What a ripoff!!! Did not seem to care if we complain..... so here is your complaint Jack's New Yorker Deli, for all to see..  No worries we will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is on point. I'll be back again and again. It's finally open after many weeks of renovations (used to be Therapy Cafe). Usually a new restaurant has many kinks to work out but I must say they seem to have their act together. Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Met the owner - nice guy! I've had the Meatball Sub and the Rachael (like a Ruben but with turkey instead of corned beef). Both were EXCELLENT. All sandwiches come with a side and a fountain drink for under $10."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time.  I was craving a Ruben... hard to find a good one in uptown.  It was FANTASTIC!  Given the fact that the food was on point, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was comfy I will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast panini. The food was good and the service was great. I'm new to the area and the staff were super welcoming and gave me recommendations of places to go. This is a great spot to just chill during down time."}
{"text":"Looking for a place in Charlotte that has delicious deli food? Well, keep looking ...  I went into Jack's New Yorker Deli on a Saturday at 1:30 in the afternoon. I was the only customer. I ordered the New York Reuben with a side of fries. Here are the plusses and minuses;  Plus: the sauerkraut was cooked before it went on the sandwich and had a pleasant mild flavor  Plus: the fries were fried when I placed my order, so nice and hot! The seasoning is salt, pepper, touch of garlic powder ... really nothing to rave about  Minus: the rye bread was \"seeded\". The caraway flavor was overpowering  Minus: the bread was toasted not grilled. The sandwich was DRY because of this  Minus: The Russian dressing was flavorless. I asked for extra on the side so I could overcome the dryness. It was just orange colored oily stuff that had no particular taste. In a blind taste test there is no one who would guess that this was Russian dressing  Minus: the meats were far too lean. This tasted like over-processed lunch meat. They say \"cut the fat; cut the flavor\"  Minus: the cheese never had a chance against the caraway. No flavor contribution here  All things considered, this was a well below average deli experience. I won't be back at Jack's New Yorker Deli. I can't recommend this subpar over-priced restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday afternoon.   Lady that took our order had a horrible and bored attitude, as if we were causing her an inconvenience.  Note the hours posted on Yelp state open until 7:00. After I ordered I was informed they closed at 3:00 and \"we can't leave until you are finished\". Clearly the attitudes overall was hurry up and get out.   Food was fine but nothing special.  Once 3:00 rolled around we were pestered to leave rather unsubtly. No need to open your doors if you don't want to serve your customers."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food. Fast and friendly service. Clean environment. beer on tap and bottled available. Linden Club is a must try!"}
{"text":"I stumbled in here at 7am after a long night of drinking.  The food came out quick, was the right price for downtown, and from what I could tell it was pretty tasty.  I'll keep this one short.  I had the salmon 3 egg omelet.  For being downtown and less than $9, I can't complain.  It wasn't amazing but did the job.  I'm sure this place is slammed on weekdays.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"As soon as I stepped in I was greeted by the cashier. She was very friendly and informative about the menu. The restaurant offered casual food but had a trendy atmosphere. They gave you a lot of food and had the best potato fries I have ever eaten. No tip is required unless you want to put something in the tip jar at the register."}
{"text":"In a hurry? Looking for a big salad? No frills, No problem.  We work in the same building as this Deli and when I am crunched between meetings, I run down here and get the Greek Salad with Chicken on top. It's really fresh and the dressing is a balsamic that is yumtastic.  The serving is huge too - no skimpy salad.  It is super fast service, you can be in and out of there in 15 minutes including sitting down and eating. If you just want to pick up and go, that is even faster.  Good range of soups, sandwiches and salads - items come with a side and a fountain drink. They have fries, coleslaw, chips etc.  I always have the salad and dine in or take out - it's always fresh and fast and about 10 bucks total including a tip.  If you work in town - this is a good spot - parking here might not be possible - it's a foot traffic location really.  I just saw on someone else's review that they serve breakfast all day - I do low carb, so an omelet mid-day, Yup.. i will do that on my next visit.  Lots of booths and tables too - so finding a seat is not a problem. They have TV's running and I should mention that they do discounts for Military, Police and Firefighters - so that is great too!"}
{"text":"My first time ordering and overall was pleased with the quality of the food.  We ordered an Al's Big Ass Roast Beef sandwich and a Ryan's Wiseguy both with chips.  Apparently, they were busy as it took about 20 minutes to complete our order (ordered on the phone for p/u).   We realized later that we never got our chips, so a little bummed about that, too.  However, the \"brownie\" made up for our concerns.  It really is a wonderful hunk of fudge masquerading as a brownie--awesome!  I really liked the Wiseguy with the salty Italian meats taking center stage.  My only criticism is the Russian dressing on the roast beef sandwich was too thin and too sweet.  It did not pair well with the beef IMO.  Next time I'll request horseradish on the side and dress it myself.  The good news is there will definitely be a next time.  Jack's has caught my attention!"}
{"text":"I have a new job for which I travel to Charlotte on business once or twice a month. This deli is right next to the office building I am working in. One of the first days I had to get lunch on my own, I popped in here and I am glad I did. I've been here 4 or 5 times since. The service is quick and friendly. I've had a couple of different sandwiches and usually get the side salad for a $1.99 more. The Caesar and the Greek salad are both good and plentiful. You can also order a full-size salad and add protein. I've also had the fries as a side and they are very good - crispy with a little bit of seasoning. I also love that they play alternative music over the speaker system. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to my fellow Yelp users and they were awesome. Colleagues and I greatly enjoyed eating here with their variety of breakfast and lunch sandwiches. The homemade fries and breakfast potatoes were awesome. A little too much pepper but still great. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the downtown Charlotte area. I had the breakfast panini with bacon, cheese and egg omelette. Yummy!!!   Friendly staff and option of outside or indoors seating. Beautiful area."}
{"text":"Was not a good New York Reuben. Probably New York prices though. Very thin hot sandwich, not very fresh kraut, and a small pickle was $9.75. Drink I passed on would have been another $2.  I have been to a lot better Deli's, paid better prices for bigger sandwich. Jack's New Yorker Deli is one I can do without."}
{"text":"Very yummy!!!! The staff was super friendly and very accommodating! I will return when I'm in Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a slow Tuesday with a friend. The wait wasn't long but I was confused about how to order or if we should sit and wait for a waitress (it's the former, no waitresses).   The menu has variety but it's a bit pricey but what can you expect in uptown CLT? I had the burger which was a good portion but lacked seasoning. The fries are fresh and look cut in house but I must have gotten the bottom of the basket b/c they were inconsistent in size (lots of small burnt ones).   The place is clean but small so if it was a busy day I doubt we would have stayed to eat in."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were pretty good. My Philly could have used mayo and the meatball sub was lacking marinara. Both sandwiches were packed with flavor and the cheese was plentiful. The potato salad and fries were great, as was the service. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The sandwich gets 2 stars, the extra star is for the service.   The Hubs and I stopped in today for a bite and ordered the special, which was a BBQ roast beef sandwich with onions, mushrooms and bacon. It was quite underwhelming, especially for the price. We enjoyed the Zapp's voodoo chips way more than the sandwich. :("}
{"text":"Thank you for being across the street from McGlohon Theater and filling our Northeastern food desires while in Charlotte. You were super helpful taking my order over the phone and filling it for my hungry band in a jiffy. Sandwiches were delish and hit the spot. xo"}
{"text":"So I finally got to try this place that has opened right where the old Therapy Cafe was.  It's a true Deli style place with fresh meats and philly sandwiches, etc.  My favorite part is the fact that they serve breakfast all day.  For someone that likes to eat low carb, this is fantastic!  I had a tenderloin omelette, side of ham and side of bacon.  It was delicious and the servings were plentiful.    The parking is pretty much non existent so if you're not working or living uptown then this is going to be a tough place to visit.   The interiors are very simple but they have huge TV's that will make this place a good sports bar once they get their permits in order.  I'll be back for sure to check out their beer selections at that point."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to eat! If you live in Charlotte or are just visiting you have to try JND's!"}
{"text":"Great to finally have another place on North Tryon! Love it here. Big menu, great food, friendly service. My faves are their breakfast sandwiches and the Reubens. Comfortable seating inside, nice patio seating with a good view of Tryon. I've lived next door for almost ten years, this is a great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened up in my office building and I thought I would give it a shot. Its about time something takes over the old Therapy Cafe! They have a large variety of sandwiches which is nice. I am a vegetarian and have ordered 2 of the vegetarian sandwiches, and while they were both pretty good, the bread was soggy both times. The pasta salad I got as a side was great though! I will definitely return since it is a very convenient option for me, but I wouldn't say its the best sandwich I've ever had in the world."}
{"text":"Had the Matt concoction.  Very tasty has a little kick to it little spicy but blends well with this sandwich.  Would for sure order again.  Reasonable in price overall quick service."}
{"text":"Great simple lunch spot. Nothing crazy just great sandwiches at good prices. I assume if you brought a New Yorker here they would complain that \"you call thatttt a NY deli?\" Just ignore them and enjoy your tasty sandwich and fries. Perfect for a big group getting lunch you can all order separately up front and there is a ton of seating inside and out. I had the mad Italian and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went to Discovery Place and was hungry so we spotted this place down the street.  Easy ordering just inside the door. Standard deli items with sandwiches being the featured selections.  My dad got the Big Ass Roast Beef Sandwich. My wife got the standard Reuben. My daughters got the chix fingers and chili dog respectively. I got the NY Reuben with spicy mustard.  All the sandwiches came with fresh homecut French fries.  A nice touch is malt vinegar is on each table.  The sandwiches we stuffed to satisfaction.  The meats were tender and delicious.  The fries were hot and equally enjoyable.   Two things kept this from being a 4-star rating.  For whatever reason, our Reubens were only grilled on one side.  The other side had the mustard on it and it turned the bread quite soggy.  Secondly, the mustard they used was quite intense and they used way too much of it.  That was all you could taste in the Reubens was the mustard.  I love spicy food but the mustard should have been a background flavor and not the main event.  The bill came to $47 for three adults and two children.  That included drinks.    I will try this place again without the mustard."}
{"text":"They have pork roll. Really all you need to know.  Passed by this place many times and didn't really think much about it. It will definitely be a staple on the walk to breakfast list. The staff was so friendly and they have an awesome patio too.   I got the heart attack (minus L,T, mayo) and it was delish. Loved the breakfast potatoes too. The seasoning really is addictive. Boyfriend got the breakfast panini. It was good but nothing special.   The condiment situation on the tables is everything you could want. Horseradish mustard. yum. Jack's Deli Dust. yum. Texas Pete and Ketchup. Gotta have em."}
{"text":"From kids meals to the adult meal. This place was a hit with my family. We will be back. Try the Matt Concoction and the fries don't think you will be disapointed."}
{"text":"If you love a good, loaded sandwich and amazing fries, this place is for you.  They put this special seasoning on their fries. And it works perfectly. They sell the seasoning, I guess cuz people love it so.  A huge selection of sandwiches. If you can dream it with meat, they likely have it. I like Corned Beef and Cole Slaw. Yep, they have it.  Parking is tricky at lunch. I go around 12:50ish and can usually find a spot.   Give it a try. I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Happiness is a well put together corned beef Reuben and very well seasoned (and fresh!) French fries!!! Loving my visit to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome chicken parm sandwich. Took a little longer wait but at least they warned me about it on the menu.  Taste was great. Only complaint is sandwich \"sloppiness\"--meat and inside didn't fill the hoagie so got plain bread at finish and was unevenly toasted...burnt edge and uncooked bottom.  Now understand, I am being picky...it still tasted awesome. Good marinara, melted cheese, grated parm. Just wish it was a little more stuffed. Will definitely return though."}
{"text":"One of the best sammich places I have EVER eaten at.  The Reuben is amazing but the Roddie's off the Books is probably the best sandwich I have ever in my life eaten."}
{"text":"Jack's is a solid lunch choice in terms of the food and I appreciate that it's 7-8 blocks from my office so at least I can feel good about taking a longish walk after ordering a delicious but probably less than health conscious lunch.   It's a chain and despite the New Yorker in the name, don't go expecting Carnegie Deli mountains of pastrami on a sandwich. Instead, you'll get a reasonable portion of good lean pastrami that's been nicely grilled and served with spicy mustard.   My go to sandwich is Jack's Outlaw which us a sub roll stuffed with beef strip steak, pepperoni, salami and banana peppers all grilled along with hot sauce and covered in melted provolone. It's got good heat but not in a too painful way and I love to get cole slaw as the side and just dump it all over the sandwich. Yum!"}
