{"text":"I know this location is new, but it is not as good as seton or any of the others. My meatball sub was so bad I tossed half of it in the garbage. The \"sandwich artist\" slapped so much sauce on the bread it was falling apart, the meatballs were also broken in pieces."}
{"text":"One word. Sucks. Subway is just gross, hence, declining sales and better sandwich/sub places elsewhere. Their saving grace is their cookies but only when it's fresh. Funny how their subs aren't very fresh tasting, isn't that their motto?"}
{"text":"Super new subway in SE Calgary and in new community of Mahogany. 

Newer look inside and service is fantastic. Staff are friendly and as usual you can see how they make your subs. 

Very modern decor did I mention? Pricing is same as other subways and if you enjoy subs this is it!

Overall good marks for consistent service and food. Bring back the stamps please!"}
{"text":"New Subway in Mahogany is clean and bright (as it should be, it just opened) the new branding is fun and definitely modern. I stopped by to try a wrap because they had mailed out a coupon, I'll stick to my standard sandwich though for future visits. The staff could be a bit friendlier they didn't seem very engaged or active when I was there."}
