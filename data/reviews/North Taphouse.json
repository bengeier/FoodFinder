{"text":"This must be a money laundering outfit because I can't imagine any business owner being okay with their restaurant being THIS horrible in every imaginable way. The soup is canned Campbell's,  I swear it. The servers treat you like gum on the bottom of your shoe, the floors sticky and clearly very very dirty,  the booth seat full of crumbs. Avoid at all costs -  macs across the parking lot has decent smokies."}
{"text":"This pub is very uninviting and does not have food that is of quality that you would expect from the prices. The place is under new ownership and they have changed the menu to be very much Indian cusine as they advertise on their menu. Waitress seems lifeless and bored with life so don't expect a good experience.  My fianc√©e and I have tried the place 3 times giving it one more chance and this is the third strike. Never again.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"A newish neighbourhood pub run by Indians, which yields a curious menu of items like pulled pork sandwiches, poutine, and butter chicken. While the standard pub fare is as expected, the butter chicken was really rich, tasty and generous. Served with rice and great fresh naan cooked onsite in a tandoor oven (not something you see in every pub). My only complaint was that I asked for it to be spicy, but it was only medium at best. The main thing that dragged my opinion of this place down is the very slow service. There were only two tables with food during the lunch hour we visited, yet it took 40+ minutes to get our food with no drink refills while we waited. Indian food: 4, pub food: 3.5, service: 2."}
{"text":"Recently changed management, we really liked this place in the past. I really tried to give this place a fair chance because its so close to my house. I got sick from the pizza last time i was here, which didnt taste that bad... So i came back and the next time i ordered a Hawaiin burger with a cesar salad. The burger was cheap, and had little good taste, and the cesar salad was so small and sauce was not cesar at all.. My wife ordered a grilled cheese and even that wasnt cooked fully, it was like half melted tex mex on some white bread.... Also the appy we ordered, which we loved before, spinach and artichoke dip, which was amazing before, consisted of cream cheese with cheddar melted on top. Big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Mixed review. This was our first visit. We enjoyed the friendly prompt service from our waitress. The coctails were well mixed. We picked a lounge to watch the Flames game and there are plenty of TV's to do that but no sound. The food was disappointing - we ordered the Nachos with chilli meat (upsell) and it looked good but disappointing - \"chili meat\" was 80% canned chilli with only traces of meat and some of the cheese appeared to be processed like cheese slices (taste and consistancy) this combo meant many chips in lower layer being soggy. Worst nachos i can ever remember having in a resteraunt. We planned to have nachos before the game and order something later during the game but nachos were so disappointing we skipped and had something to eat at home. If it was to just have a couple of coctails I might go back but not to eat. I would give it a chance if I saw reviews that the kitchen had significantly improved. Made the mistake of going without checking Yelp. Start putting out some good food and they would do much better."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. The atmosphere kinda Sucks. Food is average. Service is non consistent."}
{"text":"Greatest butter chicken I have ever had! I dream about its so good.  The restaurant is now called Aujla. They have an excellent selection of beers as well. And I always enjoy their staff, they are very friendly and attentive :)"}
{"text":"Ordered their 'most popular dish' on the menu - fish and chips. It was mostly chips, the haddock was very small and the side coleslaw was tiny as well. I told the waitress that it was misleading from the menu description and she said that the new owners have changed everything so the menu isn't accurate - that specials are posted on social media that are not communicated to the staff. Please step up your game management!!! We'd love to be regulars but can't because of the decreasing quality of the menu items. Also - the American satellite radio station you use plays four advertisements to every TWO songs! This makes it challenging to enjoy yourself and the company you are with - making it really worth the effort to drive into Calgary or hey! Check out Browns Social house!!!"}
{"text":"We have come back here a few times now and have enjoyed it each time. The daily specials on food and drinks and friendly staff makes it a great local place to meet up with friends and family after work or on the weekend."}
{"text":"Pub looked nice inside and is now called Ajula. The food to be honest was terrible. Except the naan bread which was good.  My wife got the asian style soup which is a ripoff for 13 dollars. Frozen veggies mixed with some super salty stock and some bland noodles. I got butter chicken(no rice) Just chicken drowning in sauce like soup. I hate to be mean but for the 34 dollars it cost, never again, no way. They were nice people but they need to 1)Review their prices (the soup was worth about 6.95 not 12.95 and they need to eat the food they serve. Which I am pretty sure they don.t. Cant say anything about the beer or service this is just a heads up for avoiding a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Last chance tonight.  3 x and out.  Smoked meat on rye with fried and coleslaw arrived without coleslaw and on a white roll.  When asked the waitress took the plate to the kitchen and return to explain that they were between menus (2nd time this was a reason for us) and there was no rye but she could bring out some coleslaw if it was wanted (well of course it was what was ordered)!  The special was a fried chicken sandwich, which was quite small (more a slider) with lots of bread.   The Caesar salad arrived with can only be decribed as \"watered down\" dressing resulting in over dressed salad with what was soupy bottom and soggy croutons.  Only saving grace in our meal for 4 was the nachos, while over priced and not overly dressed (other than cheese) for $18.95 they were crisp and filled the void.   The waitress apologized at the end and seemed sincere.  However the owner (we presume) was in the restaurant and never came over.   I suspect the wait staff are used to making apologies for the food given the sincerity in which the plea to return is delivered.   Paid full price for what was a lacklustre meal, without even an offer since the smoked meat only closely resembled the menu description.   Won't be back again.  Lots of choice within a short drive now."}
{"text":"Saw this place was under new management and decided to give it another try. Way better experience. Food was good, service was good. Glad to see they are turning this place around because it has great potential considering the location. Docking a star because it still has a crazy menu. But huge improvement overall."}
{"text":"A affordable, upscale neighborhood pub with a great lunch menu and an enormous beer list, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner over Christmas holidays while visiting family. The place was fairly quiet and our server was very attentive and pleasant. A great selection of cocktails and beers it was tough to choose just one! the food was also great. I had the BLT sandwhich with yam fries that was excellent. the only low point was the fish and chips. Others had found them to be hit and miss with one being delicious and the other soggy and not well cooked. The atmosphere is nice open concept with lots of TV's to watch the game. They had the game sound off and then on and we weren't sure what that was about but as we didn't want the noise on so we could visit it didn't bother me at all. though I imagine those wanting to focus on the game would be a little frustrated."}
{"text":"Hmm. I've been here a few times now, and my experience has been average. Nothing spectacular or horrible enough to drive me to write a review...until the last time we were in.   It was around 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday night and myself and eight or so others came in to the North Taphouse for drinks and appetizers. Our server, who seemed young and maybe a bit overwhelmed, very loudly stated to another server (right in front of our table) that she \"Doesn't fucking want them (us)\" because she was too busy and \"wished other people would do their fucking jobs.\"  Umm...unprofessional much? We were seriously shocked and turned off, and had we not been freaking starving, would have left. My sister did mention it to a manager on duty, who seemed surprised by it, and assigned a different, more cheerful waitress to our table for the rest of the evening. I appreciated the new server with a better attitude, but would have appreciated an apology from the manager or even the rude server herself. Needless to say, we all left with a pretty bad taste in our mouths (and not even from the food, I can't even remember how the food was because of how rude the server was!).  I'll likely take my business elsewhere from here on out."}
{"text":"The North Taphouse is tucked away from the \"downtown\" area of Chestermere and is definitely more of a place that is frequented by local Chestermerians, but it is definitely an adequate place to hang out, have some drinks and grab a bite.   The food is decent. It does seem a little inconsistent in preparation, but overall, it's still tasty. And as far as I am concerned, they are fantastic at cooking a lamb chop! Yummo.   The servers we've had have given great service. They were attentive and always made sure we had a full drink.   Hey, maybe not a place to specifically seek out but it is definitely a great consideration when you are out in Chestermere and looking for a place to go."}
