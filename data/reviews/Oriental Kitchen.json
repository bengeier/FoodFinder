{"text":"Looove this place. My favorite Chinese restaurant by far! Prices are good for the portion provided."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based on a recommend from a coworker and was disappointed. The young boy taking our order started by asking for my credit card number, I insisted on giving it to him at the end. He placed me on hold to calculate the total and I could hear him cursing at his coworker- very unprofessional. Order arrived 20 minutes late. Fried rice was bland a greasy. Black pepper beef contained a very runny sauce that was flavourless. There was a  good portion of lemon chicken but the sauce tasted like lemon jello mix. Hot and sour soup was way too spicy to be enjoyable and I can take heat. Wonton soup was filled with Bok choy and the broth came from a box. All in all it was a disappointing meal considering the price point is higher than other places in Markham."}
{"text":"By far the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Very bland, under cooked. They used spaghetti noodles for their chow main. Egg rolls were like rubber and flavourless."}
