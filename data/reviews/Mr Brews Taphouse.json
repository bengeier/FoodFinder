{"text":"I've only gotten takeout from this place so I'm not really going to speak to the service and the atmosphere.  After visiting Mr. Brews on the west side we started ordering from this location because it is much closer to our house.  We've been here 3-4 times already.  Why takeout?  Well, aside from the fact that we often like to order takeout, it is very difficult to find parking close to this location, especially free parking.    I've placed orders here and it consistently takes them less than 10 minutes to get everything together.  The quality of the food is pretty  much identical to the Mr. Brews on the west side (as far as I can tell).  The Kentucky Bourbon burger is a favorite, in my opinion with a delicious bourbon mayo and a few delicious strips of crispy bacon.  My husband has tried the California burger as well and thought it tasty as well.  We usually order the pub chips as well which come topped with bacon, scallions and their homemade beer cheese sauce.  This is an excellent place to get a hamburger and fries."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The GM is so friendly and the staff is amazing.  Great beer selection for those looking to explore new options. PS. Get the bruschetta burger!!!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service and delicious food.   The chicken sandwich is consistently perfect, and the seasoning on the fries is worth the price of admission.   Love Mr. Brew's!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back.  Service was excellent, food was great, beautiful venue and if I were a beer drinker, huge selection!  Although the appetizers they have are great, would like to see more, something to go with the AWESOME beer cheese...like soft pretzels!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and were SO impressed with the beer list. And, the burger and cheese curds alone are with coming for. I'm so impressed that Madison has this amazing restaurant/bar. Also, the bartender was so knowledgeable. Family friendly or just for happy hour, it's a great place...and, I'm picky"}
{"text":"We were back in town for the Ironman in Madison, after living here for UW   While cheering and waiting for our runner to make another loop,  we looked around for a place to grab a bite..... for 8 of us -  Found this right around the corner from our spot on State - so went in - it was mostly empty.  Our server seemed like a weird guy from the 60's - headband and all -  finally took drink order - for 8 of us - brought out 2 at a time, so took awhile. Then took our meal order, and we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited -  and this was for just your normal burgers. Finally he brings the food out - said there is only 1 guy in the kitchen... but place is empty !! We eat, relax, and enjoy our time - BUT then have to pay and rush out to catch our runner since we waited so long for our dinners......"}
{"text":"The service is less than good.  My server is blan, no personality and quite frankly,  if I wasn't waiting on my food I would leave... I hope the food is better than the waitstaff...I work in hospitality, so I get customer service or the lack there of...."}
{"text":"Less crowded than Hopcat but still with a great beer selection.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  I really like the homemade chips.  You can choose plain or with a seasoning of your choice.  A solid edition to the downtown bar scene."}
{"text":"I have never left a restaurant so angry.  My waitress was wonderful, the beer was good, and the food was good. Well what the heck, why so angry? When we first sat down for dinner there were others eating around us. They began to leave then the band showed up. Great music, I like music. I began think I would stay have another beer and enjoy the music. Then my food arrives just as the the band began to setup, moving all the tables around me, setting up speakers and stands all around me. I was surrounded with now where to go. I hate when someone invades my space and I was unable to enjoy my night. They were standing over top of me were I couldn't even lay back in my chair. They ruined my dinner for me and I will never go back.   If the manager knew there was a band playing they should have blocked off the table I was at, or at least notified me when I first sat down."}
{"text":"Good assortment of beers, Celeste was a great server! If you go on your birthday you get a free brew. They do not have any wine or spirits here, only beer. We didn't realize that when planning a happy hour here."}
{"text":"This location is preferred over the Verona location as the tap list is more diverse and bigger.  Being a chain, the food was relatively the same as the other locations I've been to.  As for the staff, they are much more pleasant and well trained than their Verona counterpart. Polite and attentive, their knowledge on their beers is much better. Oh and they take coupons without stink-eyeing you or asserting that you are some kind of criminal."}
{"text":"I went to Mr. Brew's Taphouse about 3 times now. It's clean, it's new and it has a pretty solid atmosphere. My only complaint is the food. Last time I went there, a server named Nikki didn't show up and a bartender had to step on over. Even though the bar wasn't that full (maybe 10-12 people) the bartender got flustered and couldn't keep up... I totally understand since that's not the bartender's fault. I was patient with him and felt really sorry for him. However, when I ordered my burger he did not ask me what I wanted for toppings, and did not inform me that the fries are not included. I also ordered a small coleslaw as a side, which turned out to be the worst coleslaw I have ever seen. I could not get myself to even try the coleslaw because it was extremely watery. The coleslaw was definitely a few days old and anyone could tell it lost its freshness. So I ended up paying $9 for a TINY cup of coleslaw and a burger with cheap buns, a mediocre patty, and some sauce. I would recommend going there to drink and chill but definitely stay away from their food... Some of my friends enjoy the food there but you really shouldn't have to pay $8-9 for a burger that's McDonald's quality."}
{"text":"The beer was good and the bartender was very friendly, but the decor was like \"when your brother who is living in your parents basement for too long decides to open a restaurants and isn't sure what do to with the space besides take design tips from Chipotle and then designs a logo/sign for the outside of the store using Microsoft Word clip art from 2003 and then brings his \"man cave\" leather chairs.\""}
{"text":"Burger week to try their Kentucky Burbon Classic. Very good and juicy, the sauce seem to be a mayo base. The string onion were a good crunch. The place is bright and open, friendly staff and great selection of beer. Overall I'd come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Ok place but nothing spectacular. We had the Kentucky Bourbon burger and Bacon Mac n Cheese burger. Both were just ok. The fresh-cut fries were good. They come ala carte. Thought things were priced a bit high considering  This place serves only beer and wine -NO liquor.  Atmosphere is sterile. Not a place I'd feel compelled to return to but it was convenient while my car was getting serviced across the street.   Staff were super nice and personable."}
{"text":"Surely a beer that is called \"Aggressive \" seemed like like a logical place for me to start. A nice IPA from Surly. From there i moved to heavy ABV stouts, and i remember less and less....lol. As with other Mr. Brew locations, you should be able to find a beer to enjoy. I have zero idea about the food...."}
{"text":"A burger joint that won't cook a burger under med well shouldnt be calling itself a burger joint. There's phenomenal food and a bigger tap list across the street at HopCat. If you appreciate a good burger avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"First of all, love the look of this location!  I would much rather buy local and come to Mr. Brews than go to some national chain.  The beer selection is awesome, the food is good, and the atmosphere is energetic."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night for a burger and fries and left neither disappointed nor delighted. The \"Ragin' Cajun\" burger was pretty tasty but regrettably plain; the Cajun lime sauce, applied quite sparingly, was somewhat tangy as described but didn't have a lick of the spicy cajun ragin' I had anticipated. The pepperjack cheese and fried onions added texture but minor flavor. The brioche bun, however, was on point. They did offer a spicier option which substitutes in habanero cheese and adds jalape√±os, but it costs extra...only 39 cents but I was under the false impression that it would be spicy enough without the extras (and slightly morally opposed to the idea that they weren't already included in the price).   As a side, I ordered the parmesan garlic fries but you wouldn't have known by the look or taste of them. The fries themselves were alright--thin and long and a bit stale, but tasty enough to curb my fry craving. The parmesan garlic seasoning, however, was nowhere to be found or tasted. I thought about asking if our waiter forgot it altogether but I figured it wasn't worth the bother (it was also his first day and I didn't want to embarrass him).   Even though I would give the food a 2, I'm giving Mr. Brews 3 stars because we didn't even look at the selection of beers on tap (due to the residual hangover from a ragin' (not cajun) night before) but I'm sure the selection is stellar. It didn't seem like a bar that gets too hoppin on a weekend night but I'm sure the bar experience is better than the restaurant one."}
{"text":"Super chill bar! They have a really big selection of different crafts on tap, I was pretty impressed. The prices seem lower compared to normal downtown prices for good beer!  Unfortunately, it sounds like this location is closing. Planned to frequent here in the future, but it looks like we'll have to find a new spot!"}
{"text":"Struggling to give them a 3.  Read the very first review.  Deja vu. Servers standing behind the bar not doing much.  Finally the bar keep noticed me sitting at a table without a beer and sent a girl over.  Sat for 5 or 10 minutes before the pretty blond waitress came over.  She brought my beer dropped a menu then left, another 5 or 10 minutes before she returned to get my order.  Food selection very limited, but good flavor.  Awesome beer selection.  Very clean.  Wish the service was better."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Menu is limited but perfect for being paired with beer. Only complaint was that our appetizer came at the same time as our meal."}
{"text":"I got my car serviced at the Honda dealership nearby and they suggested Mr. Brews Taphouse.   Lindsey (Lindsay?) was our bartender and she's super affable and knowledgeable with beer. She let us try a few samples and steered us in the right direction for the types of beers we enjoy.  I've heard from the Honda dealership to try the burgers. We only had the shoestring fries but it was delicious! We will definitely be back to try more food and beer!"}
{"text":"Was welcomed by an employee sitting at the bar. Sit wherever you want. Wow thanks for getting off your can to greet us. The beer we wanted to order was not tapped. Ordered two burgers, one with a chicken breast. Well they both came as burgers. Girl took off and didn't confirm it was reordered. Had to get our own silverware from the service station.  Wow. It was one mess up after another. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love sweet potato fries and these were some of the best! Crispy, hot, well seasoned. Yum! I also got the Kentucky bourbon burger- best burger I have had in months. A great place right off the highway made for an easy stop on our way up to the twin cities."}
{"text":"Love the close to home bar and the tap selection the waitstaff is amazing. All new front of the house staff since the opening and it couldn't be better !!"}
{"text":"Went in with my wife after the Badger game around 3pm.  Started off well with the pub grub appetizer.  The appetizer was excellent and the beer selection appears impressive.  Ordered the Nitro from Founders and after finishing decided to sample a another of my favorites, Shorts Soft Parade.  Unfortunately they were out.  So I ordered another selection and they were out of that one too.  So a bit surprised on a football Saturday they were out of two of their beers.  Burgers were good, nothing special, service was average as well.  Overall a bit disappointed with the beer as I was looking forward to trying a couple different ones as that is their supposed specialty.  I give it a two because they missed on the beer.  Food and service would rate a solid three."}
{"text":"Only come here if you're prepared to drink great beer, enjoy it, and celebrate America. If you aren't here to do 1 of these things, maybe your parents basement is the correct bar for you."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Madison. They hand pack all their patties and all their sauces are in house signature. I had the Kentucky Bourbon Classic and I recommend it. Their chips are cooked in sunflower oil which makes for better health and a great flavor. Oh yeah, they have 64 beers on tap."}
{"text":"They are not open to 1:00am on Saturday night. In fact the staff want to go home because they are short staffed and tired so the bar last call was 9:30 and started the table chair thing shortly there after. I will not try this place again on the weekend! Good Beer choice though..."}
{"text":"Just entering this place feels like your interrupting 3 servers just look at us I had to ask \"Do we sit anywhere\"? then waited for the little blonde server to finish her laughing conversation with the bearded server (also behind the bar) before she strolled in our direction , burgers were Meh nothing special and the fries were cold, the cheese curds were frozen and chewy the beer selection not accurate at the table menu so you spend another 10 minutes finding something else. With the amount of burger joints and bars in and around Sun Prairie with atmosphere and good food I have no reason to return to Mr. Brews Taphouse."}
{"text":"The Beer is good (one barrels commuter) but the food was not as good as the Monona location. Will drive to Monona next time"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Friendly staff. Burgers are cheap and delicious. I would highly recommend this bar."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, delicious beers, good burgers and BBQ, clean, and friendly staff. Lacking in speedy service and my fries tasted like they were from the previous day that had been reheated in the microwave. :("}
{"text":"Great beer selection! There is also explanations of the different types of beer and categorizations of beer on their menu (Ale vs. Stout vs. Lager.) I'm a large beer fan, but it's always interesting to learn more about which beers fall into each category.   There isn't a large food menu, which is one downside. They have cheese curds (highly rated) and fries as well as a large variety of burgers. If you're not really into burgers (can substitute turkey, bean, or chicken patty) it's probably better off as a place to get some drinks.  I had the jalapeno popper burger, which had fresh jalapenos, fried onions, and a tangy barbecue sauce. I added bacon and a fried egg (why not) and I was impressed with how good it was.  I had good service while we were there. Our server checked up on us multiple times was very friendly.  Overall, I would recommend it as a place to watch a game (lots of tvs) grab a couple beers and get a burger. If you're looking for a more diverse menu, it may not be the best place for you."}
{"text":"Gotta love the location if your a car guy. Views of East Madison Toyota are stunningly beautiful. A little tight and loud at times but it gives you time to figure out the menu of 100 beers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I picked this place at random and it was the perfect choice; this place was absolutely fantastic. They have 72 beers on tap, which were all great options. The menu is made up of just burgers, but they are all funky and sound amazing. I have the brews-chetta burger, which was absolutely phenomenal. My boyfriend moaned through his whole bacon mac n cheese burger. The waitstaff was super friendly and more than willing to bring over samples of any beers you wanted to try. I highly recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Limited variety on the menu and general more of a pub/bar feel than a restaurant so probably not ideal for small children.  We had a very friendly and helpful waitress.  She recommended the pulled pork sandwich which hubby had.  Besides the pulled pork and one salad, everything else is burgers.  I didn't notice immediately but you can substitute a chicken or bean patty on the sandwiches so that increases the options.  I opted for chicken on my Kentucky Bourbon sandwich.  It was okay --  a standard chicken patty with bacon, cheese, onion and bbq sauce.  Kind of messy, I should have requested a fork.  Hubby wasn't thrilled with his pulled pork sandwich saying it was a bit fattier than he preferred and it was more chunks than pulled pork strings so the whole thing didn't hold together well for him.  Also sandwiches don't include a side though they seemed priced like a \"basket meal\".  We weren't too excited about fries or chips so we got the cheese curd appetizer to share.  At $6.50 it seemed like a small portion, but I suppose that kept us honest about our caloric intake.  I don't see us rushing back here anytime soon though nothing really would prevent us from going if it was something that would work for us in the moment."}
{"text":"I'd highly recommend Mr. Brews for happy hour! Running from 3-6pm on Monday-Friday, their generous timeframe coupled with the $3.50/pint deal makes you feel like you've hit the jackpot!   As far as selection of brews go, there are plenty to choose on the multi-page drink menu! However their drink menu does not provide location information (city/state/country) for the brewing companies which I enjoy using as part of the decision-making process. As of late August, they were featuring Fulton Brewing Company beers, and The Randonneur is a top pick for those who like summer seasonals and saisons.  The cheese curds at Mr. Brews were very standard. With more breading than cheese, I was not impressed but satisfied because hey, they are still cheese curds!  Overall the feel was industrial with a small pocket of nice couches/chairs if you wish to partake. Several wall-mounted televisions will likely make Mr. Brews a great place to a catch a game come football season."}
{"text":"Overall probably wouldn't go back. Luckily I had a coupon because I would not want to pay full price. The fries were extremely salty, slightly cold, and very chewy. The burger was pretty good and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The waitress wasn't very attentive and not a very large menu selection."}
{"text":"I came with friends to this bar because we wanted to watch a football game. There was another bar we wanted to go to but it was toooooo busy for us and we couldn't get a table.   Drinks | My friend got a Here Gose the Grapefruit and I ordered the Raspberry Kombucha. They were both delicious and only $5 each. Really reasonable.  Atmosphere | Lots of high-tops and TVs which was greatly appreciated, but the sound only worked for one of the TVs at the bar that was not playing our game which was disappointing.   Food | We also ordered a family size fresh cut fries. My friend wanted to try out two different seasonings: cajun and Parmesan garlic. They were able to give us a basket of each and we also requested a side of the beer cheese sauce.   I am definitely coming back again. Parking was not that bad. I got a spot right outside of the bar."}
{"text":"Cranberry Inn, Mercer WI.    Lovely rustic small motel style inn.  Very clean, nice size & newly appointed rooms.  Parking directly in front of your room.  Very Quiet.  Very nice owners and Mercer is a cute little northwoods town."}
{"text":"The service was a little lacking. The burger was pretty good, nothing special. Would give it another shot."}
{"text":"Very new and clean bar. Do they watch bar rescue ? I'm not sure if they sell liquor, maybe just beer, but lots of beer. Food looked above average but we didn't eat there. So many beers to choose from. Nice place, would stop back to check out some new unique beer."}
{"text":"This place was a little strange to me but I liked it. They have a huge beer selection! Even for Wisconsin standards it was pretty big. The staff was extremely friendly!   We were all shocked at how small the place was for such a huge beer selection. I guess I just expected a larger dining area. It was fine though.   The food menu is VERY small! It's basically burgers and fries. If you aren't in the mood for that I would skip this place. We all enjoyed our burgers though! I can't say enough about how sweet the staff was! If I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely at least stop in for a few beers!"}
{"text":"If you're needing a quick burger while you're passing through Wisconsin, this place is great. Quick service, good food, lots of beer. My traveling companion and I each got burgers - I got a burger but with beer cheese sauce on the side, and your regular lettuce, onion, tomato and pickles. I was disappointed they don't cook the burgers to order, and I think the burger patty could have been a little bigger - the raw onion rings on top were thicker than the patty. But it was all still good, and that beer cheese is fantastic - dark, indulgent, thick and cheesy. My companion got their house-made kettle chips which were plentiful and crunchy.  Our server actively rolled her eyes at us a few times, which was rude and we couldn't figure out why; we didn't know what we wanted within two minutes of sitting down but it's not like we hemmed and hawed or anything? And they weren't that busy, even for a Friday night. It's also super cold in there! Make sure you check if you've got an air vent above you, because if you do, you'll need to wear your zipped up coat. On a better note, they have the cutest little bulldog on the back patio who lets you pet him while he \"guards\" the place."}
{"text":"I should first mention that it seems the new downtown Madison branch of this restaurant is still in it's growing pains phase, and shows promise. Truly. But the smell of paint is still fresh, the staff is still getting used to their surroundings and figuring out how their menu works.   Now, the food was good. We had a couple of burgers and while I was sad they could not cook burgers to requested temperatures (I'm a medium rare kind of girl) everything was juicy, fast, and tasty. One was a peanut-butter burger and the other a jalapeno popper burger, which was the better of the two in my opinion. However we ordered some things that never arrived (we asked for the sweet potato fries and cajun fries as our sides for our respective burgers, and instead received 1 large basket of cajun fries to share) even though we were literally the only other non-staff at the bar that day, so it's not like we got someone else's food by accident.   The bar staff were nice and attentive if a little... quirky. They definitely told us some things about themselves that seemed odd to share with random first-time customers, but hey I can cope. I'm not here to judge you.   The beer list, as promised, was very extensive and descriptive. It was a little oddly presented though, as a set of white standard printer-paper sheets stapled in the top corner like a highschool book report. But if you don't mind the presentation, the list was well organized and clear.  The chalk-board wall list on the other hand looked like a giant wall of confusion to me. It seemed like more of a photo-op wall than an actual useful list. I'm sure it's there just to have your photo taken in front of 50 beers.  Anyway I will be back to try it again, as I think this chain might do well despite the nearly oppressive number of brewhouses in downtown Madison these days. There's no shortage of 22 year old college kids just discovering that there's more to beer than Budweiser, and downtown is always hopping so even with the new Hop Cat that opened nearly simultaneously, I think they can make a go of it.   By the way, I read a pair of reviews where someone faulted their service and attitude for not serving their red wine chilled. Red wine should be room temp and so it will always be stored at room temp. But if someone is being weird about it, just throw some icecubes in their red wine or give them a chilled glass or whatever, and leave them to their weirdness instead of making them feel bad about it. That's how you lose tips. And if they should be ordering their drinks from their server (agreed) then just tell them their server will be right with them to take their order and bring the drinks to their table. That's just the nature of the service industry beast, you just have to suck it up and be nice about it, and coach the guest into correct behavior. Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and I'd say it was a solid experience. I really enjoyed the beers I tried and the beer menu was quite extensive with lots of options for each different type of beer. I'd say it ranks better than HopCat for the \"happy hour\" specials because they have several more that qualify for the cheaper prices than HopCat does.  The food menu did not impress me. They only had a couple of \"sides\" and the one I got (sweet potato fries) was way too salty. The entire entree menu was made up of burgers, and even though they could be substituted for black bean patties, it did not satisfy my vegetarian self.  Our server seemed to forget we were there. It took her much longer than usual to deal with the check and she would say she'd be back in a minute to take our order, when in reality it took more like 5-8 minutes. All of this would be okay if the place was packed, but we were one of only four or five tables. She also forgot to bring us water, which I asked for twice. Not sure if this was a fluke or not since everyone else seems to have been impressed with the service.  Overall, great place for beer but not a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Whether it's the best burger west of the Rockies or the chicken sandwich with Mr. Brew's signature bourbon-barrel sauce (served with Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale), head to this Mr. Brews location for the friendly service of the world's most magnanimous bartender, Lucious!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Mr Brews and it was just ok. The place is wide and open and doesn't feel that cozy. When I sat down service was quick with 2 samples and my beverage. I asked for a menu and it took the bar tender a few mins to find one. The menu is very limited with just burgers. I then sat there for 15 minutes with the menu in a position like I was about to order and nothing. They were too busy doing there other things to serve me.My beverage was done so I just asked for the check and left. My first visit was so lame lame it maybe my last."}
{"text":"When opened it seem like a hit.  Good staff - food selection limited but good, beer selection super. Outdoor space nice.  Since open bummed to say this place is a mess.  Service really weak, new staff every time in.  Staff knows nothing about craft beers.  Really loud.  Last time in younger staff complaining about customers while I was sitting at bar.  Live nearby was hoping this would be my go to stop, but people I know are already avoiding the place.  Even the great fries are coming out lame! Monona location is an upgrade."}
{"text":"Really great service! Food was good too. Honestly i didn't expect very much. I would recommend the sweet potato fries, best I've ever had! I liked the atmosphere in a beautiful building."}
{"text":"As the name says... it's a true Taphouse!! Love the selection.  Food was not a strong point but appetizers with your taps would be recommended. I tried the mushroom Swiss burger and fries. The burger was pretty good but there was like a brown packaged gravy mix that the mushrooms were in...not the usual mushrooms wine flavored sauce I'm used to. The fries were great though.  Service was stellar; and that's appreciated more than the food.  Will come again for thirsty Thursday maybe."}
{"text":"First time there.  Not impressed.  Waitress didn't tell us they were out of chives that were supposed to come on our chips.  I had to ask why there weren't any.  Appetizer came and food came too soon after.  Didn't ask me how I wanted my burger and I didn't think about it.  It came and was overcooked for my liking.  My husband's fries were cold.  We did tell her but i had to get up and find her while she was standing there doing nothing.  They did give fresh fries.  Waitress never came to ask how food was or if we needed more soda.  The cooks would just crudely and loudly shout out the waitress names when their order was ready.  Wanted to use the restroom.  Now mind you, I make no assumptions that public restrooms are'clean', however out of sight out of mind. NOT here.  The toilets were BLACK.  And you could see every bit of bodily fluid on the seats. No thank you. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cranberry Salad with chicken. It came with cranberry dressing. The salad was so fresh and delicious. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. He never comments on his food or restaurants. He said his food was very good.  The beer selection was outstanding. ALOT of choices. Wish we had time for a beer, next time we are passing through.  Mr. Brew is very clean and we'll organized. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a chain bar/restaurant but probably in the best sense of the term.  It is a sports bar with high top tables, a few standard tables, a long bar, and a comfy looking lounge area.  The menu consists of burgers, fries, and not much else.  But if you do the burgers well...no one is going to miss the other stuff.  The Burger I ordered was juicy, delicious, and seasoned well.  It was topped with a creamy mac and cheese with chopped bacon bits in it.  The roll the burger came on was one of the best I have ever had.  It was my first time here so I didn't know fries didn't come with the burger, which was okay as I don't eat them half the time anyway.  The burger was so filling that I didn't need anything extra.  My server did neglect to ask if I wanted any of the lettuce, tomato, onions on the side or on my burger.  But the burger was so good, I didn't miss them after the first few bites.  My server was also the bartender.  I arrived during a quiet \"Happy Hour\".  There were very few people in the joint.  For Happy Hour, I got a pint of Stout for $3.50.  My server was attentive for having to do double duty.    I will be willing to come back for another burger in the near future."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely no atmosphere or ambience. Food selection is very limited and nothing to write home about. Although the beer selection is very numerous it is over priced compared to some other establishments with the same kind of selection. Try the Side Door downtown instead."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but exceptional service at the downtown Mr. Brews. I love to try new beers and the staff is great about offering recommendations and personalized attention. This is my favorite place to bring friends for a beer. The flights are a bargain!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much! Such great choice of beers, good vibes and atmosphere, and decent location!.... Unfortunately on a Saturday afternoon there was only two people working and it took 20 minutes to even get waited on. 3 stars because of the service but enticed enough by the variety of beer to give it another go next time I'm back in Madison."}
{"text":"Service abd beer was good but the food was not good. Fries were very salty. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Totally fun afternoon. A friend and I went in for one drink and you know the rest of the story. The bartender was super funny. Great selection of beers."}
{"text":"RUDE! LIARS! CALLOUS!  Called earlier in the day, and was told food was served until 11p. Went in at 10:45p after returning from an all evening event, and they said the kitchen was closed. Understand if you close early on a Tuesday (and you provide that notice during the enquiring call), but this was Saturday.  We had a big group wanting take out food, and they virtually spit in our face. All of us used to have a favorable view of Mr. Brews, but now all dozen of us are never visiting any of their locations again. You not only lost $200 in business that night, but literally thousands over the next few, short years."}
{"text":"Not quite ready for prime time.  While the waitress was very nice, service was unbelievably slow.  They don't have the full menu that the other locations have.  We ordered a couple orders of family fries with seasoning.  Neither had the requested seasoning.  One person ordered a burger w/o the bun.  It came out w/o the bun and w/o half the fixings.  Another ordered the bacon Mac & Cheese burger.  The Mac & Cheese was cold.  We asked for separate checks.  3 of the 5 checks were wrong.  We just paid so we could escape.  The place is quite bare.  This was emphasized with the two high pitched screaming children that came with their parents that just kept laughing and shushing them.  We won't be back anytime soon.  If we want to go to Mr. Brews we'll be going to Monona."}
{"text":"Came in to this location last night for an appetizer and a couple drinks. I really like the spot! The building itself is nice, new, seemed very cleaned. Parking was limited for the immediate lot, however the large furniture store next door has a ton of parking so I doubt it would ever be an issue.   Our server was very attentive and speedy. Beer selection was great. The beer list was delivered on an iPad. Not really sure how I feel about this. The server dropped off the iPad and after ordering he took it back. I would have liked to have a paper copy that I could casually browse at my own pace instead of feeling rushed. Other locations I've been in have had paper copies. I get it that it's much easier to update the iPad list as new beers come and go, but I still think paper is the way to go.   Ordered the french fries with beer cheese and bacon crumbles appetizer. It was good, but man on man did they slather on the cheese. It might sound odd, but really there was just too much of the beer cheese on top. We ended up only getting through about half because the cheese was just too overpowering. I felt like I was eating mush (the fries had of course gotten soggy with all the cheese covering them). The flavor was good, and the crispy fries were wonderful. Just need to ease up on that cheese.   Overall, not a super amazing experience, but not a bad one either. I will go back again in the future."}
{"text":"I just came for a beer so I can't comment on the food (though it looked and smelled good from others at the bar). I enjoyed this place because of its convenient location adjacent to my hotel - perfect for getting \"home\" safely even after having one or two too many to drink! Also, the bar staff was quite friendly. They gave me all kinds of recommendations of places to go and things to see. Too bad I was stuck in a board room for the majority of my stay. Even so, I'm glad I visited Mr Brews. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Attentive service and reasonable prices. Chicken sandwich and seasoned fries came out perfect. They also have a great selection of beer."}
{"text":"Great selection, staff knowledge of brews good. FAIL on customer service. The patron should not be an after thought. When a bartender looks at you and does not understand if a customer has not a drink in front of them, or an empty glass, how that is not a call to action; why is that person is still employed? An empty glass, or no glass at all, is lost revenue. BTW, not sure how a brew pub can be out of wings."}
