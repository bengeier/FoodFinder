{"text":"We ordered from the skip the dishes (and their service was great). Unfortunately, the dishes looked as though they were thrown together. We recognize it's difficult to achieve great presentation when delivering food, but they really made no effort. My dish (veal rolls) came with a side, and I chose pasta. The main dish and pasta both came with different types of sauce, but rather than package them separately, they were packaged together in the same container.

The worst was the antipasto plate. For $12, we got three olives, six pieces of Italian luncheon meat, one pickled cauliflower, and four pieces of processed mozarella. Extremely disappointing and vastly overpriced. 

My wife ordered the carbonara, which she described as \"typical,\" so that part at least was okay."}
{"text":"A great new restaurant in the Calgary area. Service was quick and friendly, we didn't need to wait to be seated. We ordered a variety of things, including appetizers and soups. Everything tasted fresh and delicious, and while the main course did take longer then usual to come out, it was wonderful tasting when it did. We were happy that there were halal options on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Me and my husband visited this Italian restaurant on a Sunday night. The ambiance was really nice and comfortable. The staffs were friendly and checked on our needs frequently. I had ordered Veal Chops and my husband ordered grilled salmon. Both of the dishes were really taste. I finished my dinner with the crème caramel. It's a must try if you visit there. And guess what...they have got halal options as well :) 

Definitely going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Love it!!The food was great,we tried 3 different chicken dishes including d \"melanzane alla pampigiana\",delicious!!
The staff is amazing,very welcoming and friendly.It's a family friendly  restaurant,good for groups too. There is a very relaxing and joyous ambiance in the restaurant with a very Italian feel with special paintings and decor from Italy.  This is a must try restaurant for all ages because the food, staff, and ambiance are sure to please."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stumbled upon this place last Friday as we stayed at the hotel nearby. (Not knowing it was their opening night!)

It's a clean/brand new Italian restaurant that serves your usual pizza, pasta to main. The menu is not huge but has something for everyone. At first we thought the service was a bit awkward as our server did not seem to know the wine list well (again, we did not know it was opening day) but overall was very attentive. One item caught our eye is the veal chop special that came with sides you can choose so at $20, it was a no brainer.

Then...the dish is served...it's not just your regular veal..it's a bone-in veal chop marinated overnight and chargrilled to perfection with perfect seasoning...I almost swallowed the bone too if I could.

Anyhow...two days later, guess what..we went back again expecting to be disappointed (as it's the tendency when you eat something good, usually not as good the next time)... Nope, not here...just as delicious..I was debating between the veal masala or the bone-in chop....well..the chop still won and just as great as ever.

The manager and staff are extremely friendly and this time, no glitch at all with the wine selection etc. we will definitely come back for other dishes (that if I can resist not ordering the chop again)"}
{"text":"This is the best meal that I have ever had in Canada. 

Excellent little Italian eatery within walking distance of my hotel.

Excellent service the servers really care about wether or not you enjoyed your meal.

I will come here again next time I am in Calgary"}
{"text":"I was with some colleagues this evening and they chose this place. I eat a ketogenic diet and was trying to figure out what was the best option on the menu to order. The waitress was so polite and a accommodating and helped me make the choice of a chicken dish with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes, as she said that it didn't have wheat. Then she came back and told me that typically it does have a bit of flour to thicken the sauce but they were making me a special one without the flour. Talk about going above and beyond. And the dish was delicious."}
{"text":"Just amazing!!! We've been here 4x and it's the perfect fix every time! Great menu and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Reviews looked inviting so decided to give it a try.  I think I ordered the wrong thing.  I got the meat lovers pizza.  It had a lot of meat,but was very dry."}
{"text":"Great staff and good food.  Waitress was very nice, and a cozy environment.  Not in your face with decorations or music up to notch 11 on the volume control.  Fresh braked bread before the meal, and it was different than other fresh bread I've had at other Italian restaurants.  For my entree I had a pepperoni pizza and it was excellent.  Fresh made, crust was crispy, just awesome.  It's a little off the beaten path and not around other restaurants, but I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I give the seafood platter five stars. For $35, I got a huge platter of high quality seafood - scampi, mussels, clams, basa, salmon, calamari, scallops and shrimp. Perfectly cooked, each and every piece. Huge fat mussels. The calamari was my favourite - just so tender and toothsome. Clams were super fresh. And that sauce - white wine tomato was so good I wanted to mop up every last bit of it. 

The house pinot gris was nice and good value at $10. The bruschetta was really tasty, toasty bread with minced garlic, tomatoes, basil and olive oil. I would order this again and it's an inexpensive starter at $4 for two pieces. 

The portion of the seafood pasta is HUGE. The other pastas like the gnocchi and shrimp fettucine are smaller. So if you are a big eater, get the seafood pasta.

I saw Nenshi tweet about the Garden of Italy before and his picture is on their Facebook page. I asked the owner what Nenshi orders and she told me that lasagna, vegetarian penne, and pizza. I want to return for the seafood platter and lasagna. 

Service was great. Sam is a hoot. Great place for lunch if you want something quick and way better tasting than the nearby restaurants in the same price range."}
{"text":"Coming from an Italian person, this place is fantastic!!!! Caprese salad the best in yyc, excellent bolognese sauce, can also accommodate gluten free!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! 

This place is nestled in a quiet area...talk about a diamond in the rough...the atmosphere is clean, quiet, and very welcoming!

Ask for Lisa to wait on you...she has it together.

Now the food HOLY HOLY SMOKES!!!! DELISH!!!!

I ordered the spaghetti carbonara it says spicy but it's spicy flavor and not spicy hot...I loved it...

The Cesar drink same thing just enough heat in the undertones...If you love Italian food take the time and come eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal dinner we had here! I caught my friend closing her eyes with bliss at the ribeye, which was the special. We also had the lemon shrimp cocktail. The portions are hearty. I don't ever remember a more delicious meal, and trust me, I've had my share and then some. The hours are  5 pm to 10 pm, plus lunch from 11-2:30 on weekdays. 
The waitstaff are delightful, attentive without hovering, and the beverage selections eclectic. We were too full to have dessert, but the cake looked fabulous!
I know this says it's an Italian restaurant, but it's so much more than that!  This is one of those places you don't forget."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants period. I've been to several Italian restaurants across the US and Canada, and this place beats all of them for a fraction of the price. Very nice owners, we felt at home for our dinner.  Everything was so good that we ordered almost everything from the menu as you can tell by the pictures. You can also request a halal meal, so all the meat was humanely treated, you can taste the difference when you try their steaks."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food, friendly staff, good serving portion!! One of my new favorite!!I love the seafood pasta!!"}
{"text":"I had a very lonely time at Garden of Italy.

It's tucked away in a strip mall off Barlow and on Sunridge Way. It doesn't seem like much on the outside but the food is the bomb.

The servers are super friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. We started with the calamari and bruschetta. The $13 calamari wasn't breaded, but was cooked in a delicious marinara sauce. The sauce was so good, I wanted to lick the plate. The bruschetta was $2 for a 3x3 piece of toast loaded with tomato/basil/onion mixture.

I had the chicken frangelico ($24), but the sauce was made to be too sweet and tasted like condensed milk. The sever was totally understanding and they made something else for me while removing the overly sweet chicken from the bill. It came with two large pieces of grilled chicken breast and a side of penne pasta in marinara sauce. The rest of our group enjoyed their dishes and we were all impressed with the quality of both the food and service.

Although there are tons of Italian restaurants 10 km west of this area, Garden of Italy makes its mark as a premiere place for quality, inexpensive Italian food. It's perfect for a low key date night, and also a great place to enjoy great food with friends and family."}
{"text":"Great food  great decor great service and great portion size!!!  But found out it was \"halal\" after we were done. We do not support halal it should have been posted or warned to the patrons."}
{"text":"The food here is some of the best I have ever had! Plus very friendly staff. The chicken dishes are great and so are the pasta dishes. I'm not someone who usually likes desserts but if you some how manage to save enough room they are pretty good. Well worth a trip to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner with a 15% off coupon that turned out to be expired (oops I can't read). But, the food and service were so good that I can't really complain. The place is a lot bigger than it looks like from the outside. Walking in, I was surprised by how nice it looked.

We shared the bruschetta which was pretty good, although I think it was a little oily. It also only came with two pieces - one for each of us

I had the garden penne with rose sauce and my friend had the carbonara. She said her dish was very good and very filling. Mine was also quite filling - especially because the rose sauce was so decadent. The penne was cooked well and there were no mushy vegetables in there. 

Despite all the rich pasta, we still had dessert in the form of the custard-y thing (I think it was called the creme caramel). It was quite good and reminded me of flan but a little thicker and with a strong egg/custard taste. 

When I went (September 30 2016) they were having a special where you get 15% off two medium pizzas. From what I saw coming out of the kitchen, the pizzas looked very good. I'll have to come back for that!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Seated quickly. Price was decent but could be cheaper. There shouldn't be an additional cost for meat with the pasta for the price, it should have been included.
A simple \"H\" beside the orders should indicate which ones are halal rather than memorizing what the server tells us.

Service was good, a bit slow if you ask for separate receipts they need to be quicker! Other than that the decor is nice and the place is classy!! If you are craving Italian food this is the place to be!!"}
{"text":"Wow, best Italian food I've had in a LONG time. Everything from the fresh bread to the amazing bruschetta, to the wonderful entrees, and dessert was fantastic. Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"As an Italian woman myself, I find it difficult to enjoy \"restaurant quality\" Italian food. This was not the case tonight! The food blew me away! Everything was unbelievably fresh and homemade! The inside of the restaurant was very cute and all the employees were personable and helpful! The employees had great customer service and made our dinner quite pleasurable. We had ordered the pasta fagioli, pasta carbonara, chicken parmigiana, and tiramisu. The food was piping hot and authentic! Everything was delicious! Even their iced tea was good! Highly recommend this restaurant for a date night!"}
{"text":"Finally a great halal restaurant in town! I give this place a 5 star rating. I loved the ambiance with the quiet classical music in the background. The staff was extremely friendly and provided excellent service. The food was delicious. So far I've tried the cheese and meat lover pizzas, the baked lasagna, Alfredo pasta, and garden chicken. I loved every single of those dishes. I can't wait to go back and try more from the menu. I'm from Los Angeles and we have tons of great halal food there. However I feel like one thing that Calgary had been lacking is a good halal restaurant. I was so excited when I heard of the opening of this place and decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did! I think this is my favourite halal restaurant in town so far! Love love looove their food!"}
{"text":"During our 2 week long stay  in Calgary, my husband and me visited this restaurant for the love of italian food. Garden of italy was located just opposite to our hotel four points on Sunridge way.

We were warmly welcomed by the staff. Our server Lisa was amazing and despite having her second shift of the day, Lisa's energy was infectious.

Coming to order, we ordered:

Baked Lasagne: Layered homemade pasta with beef, parmesan, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce was utterly delicious.

Chicken Pizza: Thin crust 12\" pizza topped with sautéed chicken, mushroom and sun dried tomatoes. However the pizza disappointed me a little bit as i was looking for the authentic italian taste in that.

Overall i would go with 4.5/5 for Garden of italy and i would definitely love to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and this place was recommended by our hotel.  What an excellent recommendation.  I had the linguini with clams and it was awesome.  The red gravy /  sauce was to die for.  One of the best I have had since visiting Italy.  I would highly recommend"}
