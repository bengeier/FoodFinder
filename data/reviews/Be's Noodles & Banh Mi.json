{"text":"Best banh mi and pho !! Love this place it's soooo good and it's the real deal! Affordable super tasty Vietnamese food!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled there is a Vietnamese restaurant in Ballantyne. I lived in Uptown for the last 10 years and was used to the variety of restaurants in and nearby. I didn't realize that the selection of ethnic food here was limited. The service is excellent with the sweetest and most helpful staff. The pho is average compared to the restaurants on Central Ave and South Blvd. I have yet to try their other menu items but I'm sure I will with time. Nonetheless, service is quick and I'm happy to have one in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Superb eats!!!   We were in Charlotte from Atlanta to babysit our granddaughters for New Year's Eve and our daughter recommended Be's. It really was wonderful - huge portions, exceptionally fresh ingredients, great pho (beef), lemongrass chicken with noodles and spring rolls - the perfect takeout for football and granddaughter watching!!  Back in Charlotte for granddaughter watching in early June, and eats at Be's was mandatory ... still wonderfully fresh & delicious ... Can I give em 10 stars for the great eats (lemongrass chicken with noodles & sauce, and spring rolls) tonight that we took in while our daughter and son-in-law went to a concert ... What's wrong with this picture? ... NOTHING! ... Be's plus babes, PERFECT!!"}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding.  I have been several times and this place does not disappoint.  The Fresh spring rolls, Pho and Vermicelli Noodles are the best in Charlotte.  Can't wait to try the Banh mi next visit."}
{"text":"I tried Be's Noodles and Banh Mi based just off of reviews online.  These reviews lead you to believe this place is quite the gem.  While I can agree that the service was great, I will say that the food is not great.  We order the combination pho To Go.  When we opened our to go box, they had pho toppings with half cooked meat and half RAW MEAT.  We asked them why the meat is raw and they said so that we can cook it when we got home. I've never heard of a restaurant putting raw meat in with your cooked ingredients so you can finish cooking it at home. I just want to reiderate that this RAW MEAT was placed ontop of our cooked noodles. The rest of the food we got was OK- but not even close to the hype of the reviews on this page.  Sorry- but this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"The bahn mi here is better than my previous go to shops for bahn mi (Le's Sandwiches and Crispy Bahn Mi). Try the Lemongrass Grilled Pork bahn mi and you shouldn't be disappointed! There's also pho, bun, and rice dishes on the menu, but those might have to wait until I get tired of the bahn mi, which might not be anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Great fast food Asian restaurant with great portions, great taste, for a great price!"}
{"text":"Best pho in charlotte! Coming from Seattle I am often disappointed with the pho offered around the charlotte area until Be's noodles & banh mi opened up. Their pho is absolutely delicious and broth is extra savory. It is very authentic. The prices can't be beat either. Their banh mi sandwiches are excellent and the bread they use is so good. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. All appetizers are great, vermicelli bowls are nice and big. Good sized portions with a nice price tag. Their cashiers and wait staff always do a stellar job. There has never been a time where I have walked out with a frown. If you live in the area it's an excellent quick bite and even if you live a little further away it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"By far the best pho I've ever had. The broth is so flavorful and they give you more beef than any other place I've been to. Everyone is nice and helpful and overall has a good environment."}
{"text":"Most delicious Pho I've ever had.  Most delicious broth I've ever had.  So fresh and flavorful.  Huge bowl with tender filet and fall-apart brisket.  Cilantro was fresh...bean sprouts crisp.  What a lunch.  So good!  Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I had given up hope of finding good pho here--every shop I've tried in Charlotte has been watery, tasteless soup. But Be's is hearty rich broth like I've had in Saigon, stewed for days with all the fat skimmed off. The meat is super tender and the noodles are just right--chewy, not too thick and not too thin. The accompaniments are fresh, the lemongrass chicken sandwich is amazing, but the best item on the menu is the pork belly skewers. They don't serve you huge hunks riddled with fat. Instead, you have delicious ribbon curls heated over high flames and covered in the most tasty sweet and salty seasoning. The texture is like chewy bacon, but so much better. A definite must-have. The cashier who recommended this to me said she had eaten two orders plus a pork belly sandwich--and it was barely 11am!"}
{"text":"I was a fan until today. I went in for the lemongrass chicken bahn mi and pork belly skewers, they no longer serve the pork belly which I was ok with but they are on the menu in the restaurant so should be removed. I opted for the bahn mi and a coffee. I was told it would be about ten minutes, not a problem. At about 15+ minutes I started to wonder how long it would take to make a sandwich and had finished my coffee. I noticed someone behind the counter look over and ask another employee where my order was and then they started rushing around. A young man came out and said \"Um, we forgot to make the sandwich but are making it now\" This was one sandwich, not a huge order and they were not busy. Finally my sandwich was out and the girl did apologize but offered no refund, nothing. I noticed when I got to the car that they threw in some spring rolls which appear to have pork in them which had spilled out of the box. I appreciate the gesture but all around bad experience, sloppy. Sandwich was not cut in half like it typically is. I am not super picky but this was very unlike this place, hoping they aren't getting too comfortable and just becoming sloppy. I will not likely be back."}
{"text":"Welcome to Ballantyne Be!  Absolutely delicious. Ordered some of everything and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho broth out there. Authentic bone marrow base broth... perfect balance of richness and spices. So savory! And the staff is so extremely friendly. Excellent customer service. Can't wait to try the Banh Mi next!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The lemongrass grilled pork over vermicelli noodles are to die for! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesomely warm and delicious authentic pho.  We loved it. First time.  Friendly and helpful.  Beef was super tasting"}
{"text":"The Pho was great! Loved it! The owner and staff are very friendly. They stopped by couple times to check on us, ask about the food etc. Happy to find a great Vietnamese place in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I'm a Pho lover, and found theirs to be really good. The broth was very flavorful and the meat portions generous. Also had spring rolls which were tasty and huge. Everything tasted very fresh.   Service was also great, with the food being delivered quickly and several people coming to check on me.   I'm in Charlotte on an extended project and will likely make a weekly visit to Be's."}
{"text":"Very good pho and spring rolls. The menu is small and simple but they do everything really well!"}
{"text":"Great service! Finally a Viet place in Ballantyne...The staff is very nice. A must visit"}
{"text":"They were really great when they opened, about a year ago. It seems like they've really scaled back in quantity and quality. For example, they no longer serve their lemongrass pork belly, and have cut back on the amount of sprouts, basil, and lime they serve with their pho. And their diet coke always has a slightly moldy after taste. I was so excited when they first opened, because they were really GOOD then, but I probably will not go back now."}
{"text":"So happy to have a restaurant in Ballantyne that serves Pho at such a good price! Everything I tried off the menu was delicious. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I just returned from a trip to Be's Noodles and Banh Mi. I eat here probably three times a month as I work across the street. Unfortunately, today was my last visit. I sat at the counter and ordered the grilled pork rice plate  as I always do, which is quite flavorful.      What happened next is enough for me to never return. I watched the cook remove a pork chop from the grill (presumably mine) in order to plate it and witnessed it fall on the floor. The cook then picked it up off the floor with the tongs he was cooking with and proceeded to place it back on the grill! I managed to make eye contact with him and he knew immediately that I was horrified. He then moved it off the grill, with the still dirty tongs and placed it in the drip tray of the grill. I brought this to the attention of my server, who sent over another employee to talk to me. She stated she was the \"foodsafe\" employee for the restaurant. She advised me that she feels she \"isn't in the restaurant often enough\".       Throughout this ordeal, no one had moved the previously fallen pork chop from the drip tray. I am completely convinced that someone else will receive this pork chop on their plate at some point today. I am no expert on food safety, but I would think the appropriate way to handle this would have been to pick up the fallen pork chop (with a napkin or other disposable item) as not to contaminate anything else and then throw it out. Instead, the tongs touched the floor and were continued to be used even after I voiced concern about this.      After having witnessed this, I took note of the personnel working in the kitchen and noticed, none were wearing hairnets. I may be nit-picky, but after having seen what I saw, this gave me an even more uneasy feeling, yet for some reason I wound up staying.      I am not one to bash a restaurant intentionally, but I feel that in this situation, no attempt was made to conserve me as a customer or apologize for the behavior. It seems more like they were sorry they got caught than sorry for breaking food safety protocol. No apology was issued on behalf of anyone at the restaurant. It was more like they thanked me for bringing it to their attention."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I start. The Pho is perfect every time (try them all) and the grilled pork belly app with the barbecue sauce keeps me wanting more. did I mention the barbecue sauce?! If you get chance ask for Sean, he will make you feel right at home and will recommend the perfect meal.  My son brought me home the best tasting  Bahn Mi sandwich - lemongrass pork. The depth of flavor in the meat was incredible."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp, I \"discovered\" this place yesterday.  Yelp suggested four new places in my neighborhood and this was one of them.  A pho and banh mi  fix in Ballantyne?  Really, are you sure?  Yes, it's true.  After a trip to the movies, we hustled to the car and headed over to check it out.  I longed to not be disappointed because since moving here from the DC area, I've been longing for more diversity in the food choices and here we are.  I ordered an original banh mi sandwich ($7.00), some spicy beef noodle soup($11.00) and some fried egg rolls($5.00) which were more crispy spring rolls.  Prices do seem to be a bit higher than I'm used to but the banh mi is easily shareable, and the size of the pho along with the amount of meat is good.  Plus, you have to consider that their rent is a bit higher because of the location.      My two teens didn't order anything but I told them they could try my stuff and decide.  They have jobs, they can pay for their own food. LOL!  The rolls came out right away with the accompanying dipping sauce, followed shortly by the banh mi and boy was it good. Not soon after my steaming bowl of soup came out and mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmm, good!!!  The broth was no nice!  I put my accoutrements in after getting extra mint and jalapeños and dove right in.  Both daughters got up and placed their own orders.  One got the mignon pho and an original banh mi and the other got the crispy egg rolls and the mignon pho.  Very enjoyable and my only complaint is that the jalapeños in my banh mi all seemed to be quite mild and I love the kick of spicy in my sandwich so next time I'll ask that they put extra in with seeds and all.  I have zero complaints about the soup.  I actually ran out of noodles before running out of the tender meat that was swimming in the rich broth.  That has never happened to me before.  I've been eating pho before it was a thing. Twenty plus years ago, I had a Vietnamese roomie and she introduced me to pho and banh mi when they were hard to find and not too many Americans even knew what they were.  I've even made it myself but the beef bone broth is an arduous and long event that entails skill and exacting spice knowledge.  I decided it was easier to just buy it even though mine was quite delicious.    This is the second place i've had pho since moving to Charlotte just over a year ago and it certainly is my go to spot now for banh mi and pho.  And it's in my hood!! Woohoo!  I really hope this place succeeds and I hope to see more authentic places like this opening up around town.  Charlotte needs some diversity in her food scene.  Check this place out and lets keep it busy.  I hope that they never compromise the quality of the food that they are putting out now.  Oftentimes you see over time, that the quality diminishes along with the portion sizes and then it's no longer the place you fell in love with. Let's hope this doesn't happen with this place.    Oh, and the service was great. Very friendly, very efficient and we were even given a complimentary grilled chicken banh mi to try.  We left stuffed with our leftovers in hand to enjoy just a few hours later. Yes, I took my broth home because who in their right mind would throw that stuff away?  Add some noodles to it and enjoy another round and if you don't have pho noodles in your cabinet just heat it up and enjoy some tasty hot broth and a sandwich.  Now get in your car and give it a try.  That is all!"}
{"text":"I have been eating Vietnamese food for almost 30 years and this place is the real deal!!  The Pho broth is outstanding and the bowls are huge! The Banh Mi sandwiches are my favorite--the meat is delicious, the vegetables are perfectly marinated, and the bread is fresh and divine!! I have always had to go to Central Avenue to have good, authentic food so it is nice to have a place in Ballantyne that is so good. Their menu is not as large as most restaurants but that is ok because they have perfected what they serve!!!!"}
{"text":"Only place I go to. Great tasting food. Comes out quick at a reasonable price. The sandwiches will definitely get the job done. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is always tasty. The combo pho is robust and perfect on the rare day it dips below 50* Service is warm and inviting without being cloying or hovering. The place itself is clean and organized. Being newish to the area I have no idea if it's big by CLT standards but it's big for NYC Chinatown. You order at the counter and pick a seat with the numbered flag and the staff brings your food out to you. My family and I had the good fortune of having the owner and chef bring it out a couple of times and chat with us. She's super chill with a wealth of experience, tradition and a longtime CLT restaurant pedigree to back up her pho. In the month that they've been operating they've started reaching capacity for lunch service. Go here soon before they start turning people away at the door."}
{"text":"Soooo good. Got the pho Thai and loved it. The service was excellent. This will definitely be my go to spot for pho now!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just visited Be's Noodles about two hours ago. I had high expectations based on the ~4.8 stars... and let me tell you, they more than lived up to the rating.   The food here is simply phenomenal. We just moved to Fort Mill from Greenville, SC, where he had a VERY solid Vietnamese option that we visited almost every week. We've tried a few places in and around Fort Mill, and none of them came close to that spot.   Well, we have found our new spot. We both went in with the idea that we were going to get Pho, but their Bun dishes looked awesome so we both changed our minds when we arrived - but don't worry, we'll be back to try to the Pho as well.   Our bowls were filled with rice vermicelli noodles over a bed of lettuce and mint. The other traditional items were also there as well, and the sauce was on point. I got the combination Bun, while the wife got the chicken. All the proteins were flavorful, tender and plentiful.   Honestly, this is some of the best Bun I've had. Period.   On top of everything else, the prices were reasonable to boot!   We WILL be back to this place!  FYI - you'll place your order at the counter and take a number, they do not offer full table service as far as I can tell."}
{"text":"Awesome place and so close to home. I had the combination pho which was delicious. The egg rolls are what I refer to as Vietnamese spring rolls and were also very good. The manager, I believe, greeted us and made us feel very welcomed there. He also packaged up leftovers to take home. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Ballantine. Well priced and delicious food. It's hard to choose between the pork banh mi and the pho combination. Can't go wrong with either.   I've been 3 times now and will be back!"}
{"text":"The pork banh me sand which is amazing! Pork is tender and perfectly seasoned! Can't go wrong with it. Can get very busy at  lunch so go early"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch place in Ballentynes area.  Love their Banh Mi and Pho."}
{"text":"combination vermicelli is delicious. had my wife meet me there halfway through my meal so she could order one as well. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  After 6 visits in 5 weeks I am hooked.  Though I have had the pho ga each time, I tried my wife's beef and the chicken sandwich twice.  Perfect food and wonderful service on each visit. I will keep going back!  ------------- If I could give it a 6 star review I would in a heartbeat.  We had a beef pho, a chicken pho, and a chicken sandwich among a family of four and barely finished it all.  The portions are great.  Let me just say I wanted to try this place for a few weeks and it exceeded my expectations.  Great service comfy seating and AMAZING food!  The chicken pho was phenomenal.  The broth had an incredible amount of flavor.  When I added jalepenos, sprouts, and a small amount of basil everything meshed well.  I could hardly stop eating.  The chicken sandwich was very good and my normally picky son loved it.  In fact both kids were blown away by all of the food.  The chicken pho was the hands down winner for everyone.  A fantastic meal and great place to have a meal.  My kids were asking if we could go back for lunch tomorrow.  What else needs to be said?"}
{"text":"Lemongrass pork over vermicelli noodles entree was phenomenal!! I love the flavor of the lean pork and the sauce was sweet & savory. The portion is huge and I made the leftovers for lunch.  My fiancé had the ban mi pork sandwich and he enjoyed it! I am excited to try more entrees. We had take-out and it was fast and delicious. I want to go back for another experience in house! They are as good as Lang Van and this is my highest compliment!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we are so happy to have a Vietnamese restaurant move in so close!  Spring rolls were great and Pho was so good!  We eat Vietnamese often and this is definitely going to be our new place!! HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!"}
{"text":"Horrible staff. Worst service and non authentic Vietnamese food.    I will not come back. Central ave has better options and choice of Vietnamese food.   Staff did not wash their hands."}
{"text":"Words can't describe!  Best Pho I've had in Charlotte!  So happy Be's is open near our home.  We used to drove all over CLT for good Pho!  In LOVE!  Crispy Egg Rolls taste like homemade.  Pho Ga is downright healing on this cold, rainy day.  The Lemongrass Grilled Pork knocks it out of the park. YES!  SO HAPPY!  Can't wait to try the Banh Mi and Vermicelli Noodles!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pho to go and it was easily packaged to \"make myself\", which was fun! My husband loved his noodle dish as well so you can't go wrong with what you choose. Having a place like this in Ballantyne in great and just adds to the diversity of food in the area. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their pho, bahn mis, and vermicelli. This place has really yummy food! The quality of the food is great."}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, we were really excited to try a good Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. I had the bun bo Hue (spicy noodle soup), and my boyfriend had the bun thit nuong (grilled pork noodle dish).   Business was slow for a Friday night, but the owners seemed friendly.   The spicy noodle soup was disappointingly not spicy at all. The broth is not authentic-slight tomato-flavoured broth but tasted extremely diluted. Usually this kind of soup from Hue has an explosion of flavours. My boyfriend thought it tasted like a ketchup soup. However, he did enjoy his grilled pork noodles. They give a generous portion for a decent price.   Overall, we found the place a bit underwhelming. For the 35 min drive we took to get here, we wouldn't make the effort to come back."}
{"text":"They have a lot to choose from. Not bad Pho but I have had better on Central. Because it is close to home I will go again."}
{"text":"Been to Be's several times now for the Pho and Bahn Mi. The key to good Pho is the broth and Be does not disappoint with a savory broth that is infused with plenty of flavor. The accompanying toppings including the beef, which I always get, were plentiful and were a good combination of crunchy vegetables and herbs. The bahn mi with the pork is my go to dish. The thinly sliced pork is infused with so much flavor I could eat it all day. The rolls are crispy and fresh and the accompanying vegetables complement the protein but do not overpower it. Be's is a hidden gem located in the back of a strip mall. For those that have found it, they are experiencing some of the best Vietnamese food in the Queen City."}
{"text":"I love vietnamese food.  It was a chilly with and a good pho was what I needed. We entered the restaurant, and nobody to greet us. finally a woman pointed to a table and we sat down. Then she asked  \"how can I help you?\". I told her it would be nice if we had menus. She brought us one.. I asked for another. Then another woman came over who was obviously the hostess. She asked if she could make suggestions.  I asked if they had any seafood pho and she said no. Well, I don't eat red meat so that was a deal breaker We said thanks and left."}
{"text":"Excellent had the combination vermicelli. Service is fast and polite. Nice cozy feel."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great Vietnamese food fast. The Bun, Banh Mi and Pho are all on point. Ballantyne has needed this place for a very long time and now it is here. Check it out as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time eating here and it's been hit or miss.  The pho broth is good but not the bestest; just had the pork bahn mi, nothing to write about and my appetizer spring roll were served after I got my entree.  Service and staff very friendly and helpful but need some Serv Safe sanitation lessons."}
{"text":"The lemongrass pork bahn mi was excellent. The pork had an amazing smoky flavor and was seasoned so well."}
{"text":"First time visiting here and could not be more pleased. I was greeted quickly and pleasantly.  Ordered the fresh spring rolls for starters and the Pho Ga. Wow!  Both surpassed my expectations. Spring rolls were very fresh, filled with shrimp and of a generous size.  Noodle bowl was huge!  Ate at other Vietnamese places and walked out disappointed but this place is a keeper. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Ate at Be's for the first time last night. Had the combo noodles, and it was ridiculously fantastic. The salad with the dressing along with the steak/Shrimp and noodles was great. Will go back for the Pho."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Vietnamese food in the area and have to say that this is by far my favorite place. I've been here many times and it never disappoints. If you are looking for good Vietnamese food at a reasonable price, I would definitely check this out. It's going down PHO real at Be's Noodles & Bahn Mi."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. First of all this place has amazing crispy spring rolls. Their fresh rolls were also yummy, altho a leaf of mint or basil would have been perfect. I had the combo BUN and like another reviewer said, probably the best BUN I've had. My hubs had the curry chicken which was loaded with chicken. The sauce was a slightly Spicey and smooth. They even give you some Bread if you want to dip it into the Curry. The staff is attentive and friendly. If there was a downside, I would say the menu is a bit limited. But we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. The pork belly skewers were delicious! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely impeccable. I've been here 6 times since they've opened and can't get enough. Is always fresh and the main thing that I appreciate is the consistency of the food. It's always been absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I've had bahn mi and pho tai here. The bahn mi is the best I've had in this city. The pho is just meh! I have yet to have any better pho than at Viet thai but if bahn mi is what you're looking for, this is the place."}
{"text":"A good intro into Vietnamese food but strays from being truly authentic.  The concept is very intriguing. It's almost like fast food Vietnamese cuisine. You have to go up to the counter to order your food. We got the pork banh mi ($7) and the combination vermicelli bowl ($11). A couple of things caught me off guard:  -Where are the greens in the vermicelli bowl? (Yes there's a bit underneath everything but it was unbalanced) -The pork tastes straight up like chinese restaurant pork (the ones that give free samples on a toothpick). Yes it's good but it shouldn't taste like that.  -The bread in the banh mi was pretty bland and mediocre.  Having said that the BBH and the pho looked pretty good. Will have to go back to try those next time.  It seems like this restaurant has a locational advantage with not much competition nearby, but I really recommend to those that enjoy this restaurant to try other places such as Flaming Kitchen Pho or Banh Mi Bros. If you're ever on the west coast Lee's Sandwhiches will blow you away.  Taste: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Value: 3/5"}
{"text":"Just tried it for Sunday dinner from a recommendation from my brother. Ordered takeout and everything was excellent. Pho was hot and delicious. Bahnmi sandwiches and spring rolls are also excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time visiting and the food was excellent. Spring rolls were excellent and the vernicelli was excellent. The customer service is outstanding"}
{"text":"Amazing Pho! I ordered the combination and it was wonderful! It was full of meat and the broth was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here looking to try something new for Thai. Ordered stir fry lemongrass chicken. Flavors were pretty good, however chicken and rice were both dry. Very much a chain/non-authentic feel. Was a bit disappointed with how high of ratings this place has."}
{"text":"By far the best Vietnamese food in Charlotte. My favorite is the lemongrass pork banh mi - it's amazing! Also, spring rolls, pho and vermicelli bowls are too die for!"}
{"text":"when we discovered this place.  We came back a couple of times in the same week even running into a regular that eats there 3-4x a week.  The ingredients are natural & the food is truly authentic.  The staff is friendly.  The decor isn't much but that's ok because the food itself is delicious.    We've had all the phos & the chicken vermicelli.  All have been on point.   This is a go to spot!!"}
{"text":"Only can speak to the pho which always seems fresh and flavorful. The interior appears relatively clean as well. The wait can be a bit long and I recommend you don't go too close to closing time because they may refuse your orders. They package the to go pho well and the herbs and add on's are always washes very well and clean!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great service and an awesome staff. I would definitely refer them..."}
{"text":"I had the vermicelli combo platter. The bottom layer was lettuce then vermicelli which I didn't realize would be cold but was good.  It was topped with flavorful steak and a shrimp skewer, and an egg roll.  The amount of meat and the quality were superb! Instead of the fish sauce I had peanut sauce which was very tasty. Last next to us had pho which looked great, I will def try that next time! Yummy!!!! I was scared to try Vietnamese but this was a hit!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant concept is easy and simple, and the food is good.  The reason I rate it a 2 star is because of food prep. I ordered the bha me in which had the shrimp in it. As I was eating a shrimp fell out and I was disgusted as i investigated, to find that it wasn't cleaned. Clean your shrimp."}
{"text":"Absolutely the very BEST Pho Ga and Bun Bo Hue that I have ever eaten!! I have yet to figure out all the spices that Be uses in her broth, but these combinations are so good..... Excellent sandwiches as well. My favorite is the Dac Biet"}
{"text":"\"Get the pho outta here, this place can't be all that it's cracked up to be\", I thought as I placed my order at this relatively new south Charlotte Vietnamese joint, but let me jump right to the punch line... when it comes to the food, it is! The menu is simple and clearly displayed above as you order. The restaurant is small and a little dark but neat and new. There were service and sanitation issues however on both of our visits that have dampened my enthusiasm.   Let's talk about the food first... We ordered the filet mignon pho and chicken bahn mi. As reported in prior Yelp reviews, both were exceptional. At $11, the pho was a bit pricey but easily serves two. The filet mignon was tender and perfectly cooked. The accoutrements we're fresh and full of flavor.  The Chicken Banh Mi at $7 was the real star however. The chicken is sliced thin and has a wonderful savory and slightly sweet sauce. The crusty bread, from which the sandwich gets its name, is fabulous and arrives fresh from a local bakery daily. The spring rolls were crisp and refreshing but a little boring tastewise.  As is the case with many new restaurants, there are a few kinks that need to be worked out. The sanitation score was a 93 the late morning that we went for an early lunch. On that visit, our table had not been cleaned the night before, as we were the first ones in when it opened at 11. We didn't find out until after we tried to fill our fountain drinks, that the ice machine was out and the Coke mix itself was horrible. They refunded our money and we bought our drinks from the Which Wich several doors down.   Our second visit took place on a Friday during peak lunch hours. It took 20 minutes for our food to arrive, and even then I had to go to the counter and and about it, and this was after a Banh Mi maker had already dropped by our table and inquired about my order. Servers looked lost while circling the dining room with orders, many times returning it to the kitchen with a puzzled look on their face. I also have serious sanitation concerns as I witnessed them handling food immediately after cleaning and not washing their hands.  Foodwise, this place could easily be a Gotta Try but such poor service and low sanitation grades are hard to forget. It'll be a while before I return, if at all."}
{"text":"The chicken Banh Mi sandwich is ginormous! I could only eat about a 3rd if it. Glad I opt'd for no mayo as it had leftovers that were not as soggy.   The combo plate was okay. I guess the noodles aren't supposed to be flavorful and the meat and condiments are the stars. Next time I'll opt for the rice plate. Meat was so good (lemon grass chicken, pork and shrimp). Egg rolls are full of meat but again if this is your first go at Vietnamese food, these are not like gringo Chinese rolls. They are better!   Enjoy"}
{"text":"What a great spot that offers a diverse option for lunch and dinner.  I work in the same business center and am grateful I can get my Vietnamese cravings satisfied with a little Bun, vermicelli noodles.  Order it with BBQ pork and you will be one happy patron."}
{"text":"Cute little spot in a Ballantyne shopping/business park area. The decor feels very \"corporate\", reminiscent of chain restaurants, but the service is attentive and friendly. They really seem to care that you are enjoying your meal. The Phò was good, but the meatballs tasted very bland. I'll definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Small menu and don't have boba tea etc. I ordered a pork sandwich which was about 10-12 inches for $7.00. It was alright, not the best for $7."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  The roll to fillings ratio is not great, and the roll was definitely stale. Not a great experience, sadly."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on the number of positive reviews.   I was concerned about eating Vietnamese in Ballantyne as (a) typically things are overpriced in this area and (b) there are not many native Vietnamese in this area.  Given that I was craving Vietnamese flavor, I ordered vermicelli with pork.   Yes, this dish was overpriced.   Once the dish arrived, there was no complimentary plate of basil, mint, bamboo sprouts, or jalapenos.   As typical, there was a meager amount of sauce served on the side.    I was given more sauce when I asked which is a positive.   While the meat had a charcoal charred flavor, it was a bit salty and tougher than expected.   I was extremely disappointed with the percentage of TOUGH MEAT.   I suspect the saltiness had to do with a lower quality of meat.   The vermicelli were good.   Flavor overall was good.   It appears that herbs - mint, basil, etc - were premixed into the dish which was fine but NOT traditional.   Overall, I think this restaurant is fairly typical of Asian flare in Charlotte - overpriced, relatively good, but certainly NOT comparable to what one might find in Atlanta, Washington or NYC."}
{"text":"Best vermacelli that I have ever had. Nice clean place, nice staff, great lunch spot. I gave it 4 stars because it is not very kid friendly at all. Other than that, it's great."}
{"text":"So we love Pho and try it anywhere we can.. this is extremely high ranking pho and since it's close to home it's even better. I have never had such a large quantity of steak in the pho, easily double what you normally see. The broth was light and clean, perfect basil and bean sprouts and lime on the side, and wonderful noodles. Love the overall taste and presentation."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I just ate there tonight and like the other reviewers, had a wonderful pho dinner and lemongrass pork belly appetizer. We couldn't decide between the spicy beef pho or the filet mignon pho but both of us decided on the spicy beef which was definitely the best we've had in Charlotte...even enjoyed it more than Viet Thai, which we love.   The service was so friendly and attentive and the lady who owns the place was sweet enough to give us a sample of the filet mignon pho since we had such a hard time choosing between that and the spicy beef. That too was delicious but a bit less on the savory /richness side (probably because of the beef shank in the spicy beef pho) but was delicious as well... Either tasted wonderful, just more of a personal preference on which one to get.   We will definitely be back to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Good food, great people, only place to get banh mi in the area. Best of luck. We will be here often."}
{"text":"I had never eaten Vietnamese and I tell you, this is my favorite type of cuisine now! Especially at Be's when you have over 80 years worth of experience in the back preparing the dishes. Shawn and John made it much more of an experience at Be's, rather than just dinner. As well as we're so kind to explain each item and what it was prepared with. My husband and now have since brought our family and will continue to go often! We couldn't recommend this place anymore if you like Vietnamese, which if you have never had it like me I highly recommend you giving it a try!"}
{"text":"This place would normally get 5 stars. The food here is great, I've always LOVED it here, but tonight I came in and I was really disappointed. They only have one size pho and all with meat in them. Really big. I typically get the kids size bc it's plenty of food and doesn't have meat. The young lady behind the register informed me they will no longer be selling kids bowls to adults. Ok, that's fine but maybe give an option of no meat and different sizes???"}
{"text":"We stopped in here unexpectedly when passing through. What a wonderful surprise!  My wife got the grilled chicked vermicelli bowl, and I got the roast pork vermicelli bowl. We also got spring rolls and egg rolls.   The food was delicious! Fresh and flavorful. The sauces were excellent as well. Huge portions that we just had to finish because they were so delicious but we were stuffed after. (it was worth it!)  So good, inexpensive and fresh. Highly recommended the next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"Oh hallelujah! Ballantyne finally has a pho joint. This means on those cold and rainy winter nights, there is solace to be found. Just saddle up to a bowl of warm beef broth, filled to the brim with meats, noodles and accoutrements, thanks to a bonafide Vietnamese chef who just gets it. The getting it being that properly made pho is all about that broth, bout that broth, no shi#.   We tried the combo pho, bahn mi pork sandwich, combination vermicelli plate, and spring rolls. All were tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in Charlotte.  Just love this place and the employees are so nice.  All of the food is good.  The only probably will be deciding what to get."}
{"text":"I saw an article in the Charlotte observer last month on this restaraunt.  I thought we'd try.  Was very surprised how delicious!!!!  You order at the counter, get your drinks and they bring food to you.  I had the combo vermicelli....was delicious!!! Spring rolls were perfectly done and well presented with dipping sauce.  Also got the crispy spring rolls...fried a bit to long but still tasty.  Ordered the iced coffee...very strong and needed more water...was VERY sweet!  Will let ice melt and add water at home and sip all day!!! My daughter got the chicken Pho...was a delicious broth with lots of chicken and noodles.  My other daughter got the chicken curry...spicy and tasty with rice.  My grand daughter got the grilled pork rice plate. It was good but was a bitover salted.  It could have used a bit more daikon and pickled carrots to help with flavor. All in all I think a solid 4 1/2 stars...I gave 5 as the waitstaff was amazing!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: After coming back here multiple times, this has probably become one of my favorite (if not my favorite) restaurants in Ballantyne.  My favorite dish? The lemongrass grilled pork vermicelli bowl. The pork is sooo tender yet flavorful and I love the ample pickled veggies and lettuce that it comes with. The fish sauce adds just the right amount of flavor so that the entire bowl comes together flawlessly.  Along those lines, the grilled pork bahn mi is also very good. Very flavorful from the pork and the cilantro / pickled veggies / sauce come together very well.  I also tried the grilled chicken vermicelli and was disappointed since the chicken was a tad bit too dry. Stick with the pork. You won't be disappointed.  PSA: If you get the pho to go, make sure you have a big bowl at home, less than 5 min away. The beef fillet is provided to you in its raw form, meant to get cooked in the broth right before you eat, but if you let the broth cool down, you'll have to heat it back up to fully cook through the beef. Also you won't be able to eat all the contents unless you have a massive bowl to dump everything in. So maybe just don't get it to go and eat in the restaurant. Or get the pork.  ----  4 stars for the pho.   Specifically the broth, which is full bodied and rich and delicious. Apparently, Be starts stewing the broth a day in advance with real bones, which is what gives the broth its rich flavor. Whatever magic they are doing, the broth is delicious. The rice noodles are fine and the meat in the combination pho was good (although not the best I've had), but the real winner is the broth. Also the prices are super reasonable given the large portion sizes (I had difficulty finishing my bowl).   Still have to come back and try the banh mi!"}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time & I loved it! I ordered the Pho Ga to go and it was delicious. I wasn't sure how it would come packaged to go but it was all set up perfectly with all of the toppings separate that you add yourself. It was the perfect set up and so tasty. Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend after helping her move to the area. Being half Vietnamese I was excited about the prospect of a bowl of pho or bûn.  But this place certainly wasn't what I expected.  I haven't been to an American style Vietnamese restaurant. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since I'm used to areas with larger Vietnamese communities (Seattle, SF, ATL, etc).  The menu was quite limited.  The broth didn't have much nuance, but at least it didn't seem to be bullion based. I think the others who I ate with were happy with theirs (one had bun and another pho) but I was left quite wanting... and ready to go home for good pho!"}
{"text":"Always on the look out for great Vietnamese food, I was shocked that such a small restraint can boast such a great food.  Mind you the menu is small but what was available was outstanding.  The Ph... any Vietnamese restaurant can call itself Vietnamese if the Ph is not good.  The Ph here is amazing.. almost as good as my mum's.  But personally the best soup on the menu is the Bún bò Hu. It is a spicy beef soup that is to die for.  AMAZING! a must if you want to try to authentic Vietnamese soup.  There Gi cun or Fresh rolls are great to.    I am a total fan."}
{"text":"Awesome place  it's cold out and wanted a good noodle soup and now this is one of my favorite places delicious is an understatement. The staff was wonderful and nice especially Gabe."}
{"text":"Was happy to find great banh mi in South Charlotte. The BBQ pork is delicious, but I wish they weren't out of pate because that would have set it off. The spring rolls were light and fresh too."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Vietnamese food. Not one bad thing to say about the food. The soups were above average.The Banh mi were very good. I was hoping for some home made sauces for the sandwiches. I would definetly go back for the food. Great place."}
{"text":"The sweet owner welcomes you, and all of the employees seem to carry her wonderful attitude through your entire visit to this small, but incredible, restaurant!  My husband loves the Pho (noodle soup cooked with fresh veggies and served with herbs and more veggies on the side, like fresh, crispy bean sprouts, jalapeños, basil leaves still on the stem and more...) We were so impressed with the food and service on our first visit, that we couldn't wait to return. Second visit; same fresh food, happy young woman/owner greeting us and happy servers!  I love the lemongrass chicken rice plate! You can actually taste the lemon oil in the lemon grass, and the fresh snow peas crunch in your mouth, followed by the most amazing white rice I've ever tasted. Some hoisin and siracha sauces on the side only add to the scrumptious flavors. This is a very casual, \"order at the counter\" restaurant, but every table has fresh roses! They seem to reflect the whole experience of this cute place that is fresh, pleasant, lovely and delicious"}
{"text":"Great fresh authentic flavorful !!!Best Pho I've had in Charlotte.  Not a lot of frills  serve yourself atmosphere is part of the charm.  The place was packed for lunch!!!   Must must go!!!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect little lunch spot! Every meal is under $12 and there is more than enough to take home!   The inside is clean and welcoming, simple decor, and friendly staff. They checked on us at least five times after getting our food.   I had the combination pho, and it was phenomenal. Fresh, hot, delicious, everything came out very quickly. We also got the egg rolls, Darla C had told me that they were little - and she was exactly right. They are full of meat though. I will definitely be back to try the sandwiches as well."}
{"text":"Seeing as how this is my 7th visit in a month, I figured it was time for a review. Let me preface this by saying I love pho. I've been eating it since I was in my teens, grew up in a city with a large Vietnamese population. My 4 stars are for the pho.  On to the review.... I discovered Be's via yelp a month ago, turns out it's 4 blocks from my house. I was a bit skeptical, as pho is not popular in Ballantyne. I usually drive down South blvd to Doan's or Saigon Palace for my pho fix. The restaurant used to be a sushi place (terrible), so I was happy to see this take its place.   Ambiance: Small, very clean, usually quiet spot. It can get VERY busy at lunch. There are a few booths, tables and a couple counter chairs.  Food: I usually get the pho ga, which is wonderful (5 stars). Great broth, flavorful. I mean, really good, it can stand on it's own without the accompaniments. Tons of shredded chicken breast as well. They do not skimp on the quantity. The pho comes with the usual add ins, basil, lime, peppers, sprouts.  I tried the lemongrass banh mi and was disappointed. The bread was stale and tough, too much mayo/sauce and flavorless chicken. Iill pass.  On my last visit I was craving lemongrass chicken (stir fry), yeah, no. It was worse than the sandwich. Rubbery chicken, watery sauce, the flavor was off.  Service: Usually good service. Order at the counter, get a number, pick a seat. The only issue I had was when I told them I didn't like the lemongrass stir fry, after one bite. They apologized, but still made me pay for my pho. No offer to fix/refund my dish.  All in all, a pretty good spot for pho in the burbs!"}
{"text":"My go to Pho place in Ballantyne!  The broth is amazing and the food is delicious.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"At this point, I've had the entire menu. Everything is stellar though the following are the best:  Pork vermicelli: add two over easy eggs Spicy noodle Combination noodle."}
{"text":"I just finished my enormous lunch from Be's Noodles & Banh Mi and it more than fulfilled my craving for Vietnamese food! I ordered the combo vermicelli (subbed lemongrass chicken for the pork) and spring rolls. It is a plenty for me to nosh on for at least another meal. Everything was absolutely delicious. The chicken in particular was incredibly flavorful and moist (I hate that word but that is the best way to describe it). The customer service was welcoming and not over the top. I called ahead of time and my order was ready within about 2 minutes of me walking in the door.   The price was a bit hefty ($12 for the vermicelli, $5 for the spring rolls) but again, the portions were extremely generous. I can't wait to come back to this place to try out the sandwiches and pho. Highly recommend if you're in the south Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Wow! Who Woulda thought in Ballantyne you could find such exceptional Pho.  I've had it in several different places in the country including Chinatown in Oakland California and this one matches or beats the best I've had. The filet Pho is fresh with paper thin sliced rare filet and probably the best broth I've had."}
{"text":"South Charlotte/ Ballantyne, no need to drive to the ghetto to finally get good pho and Banh mi!  The store is owned by a adorable local lady name Ms. Be, she's there early morning hustling in preparation of quality food.  Pho- no MSG is used and the broth is very clean, clear, and flavorful. When you get your pho before you jazz it up with Siracha, look and taste the broth and you will see how she has a very clear and flavorful broth! She sources her beef from never frozen meat and bones and you can really taste it in her food. The pieces of beef is so good I just wish it came with more!   Banh Mi- I use to drive all the way to Le's bakery but the flavor in her meat is incredible!  The pork was VERY juicy and Smokey as they grill to order. The bread is sourced locally and very crispy and airy on the inside!   When your hungover, cold, or just a PHOking pho lover like me, come herE! Being it down the road from my house I can come straight out of bed to Be's!"}
{"text":"The best beef noodle in Charlotte! The service is really great! I love this place, I will back definitely."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. The pho is AWESOME as is the pork sandwich.  We always get take out. Yes, we always bring the pho home and it's fabulous. Heat the broth, onions and Cilantro in pot for a few minutes. Then, add the meat and finally the noodles. Pour into two bowls with bean sprouts and add the basil. It's really wonderful and it stores well in the fridge (uncooked) for 24 hours. The pork sandwich has fresh Cilantro and Cucumbers, which sounded strange at first but one taste and you will love it. The staff is always super friendly.  We go her at least once every 10 days."}
{"text":"The sandwich has the freshest items you could imagine! Even the bread, which is like Cuban bread was soft yet slightly crunchy..The soup was very good as well.. Can't wait to go back..  The owner was very helpful and personable since we said it was our first time there."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened up. I have tried Vietnamese food at other places around Charlotte and no one came close to the flavors or texture of the dishes. Here all went well! The pho and vermicelli are such a delight! Everyone was very friendly. Seating is limited, but they do have take out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to get Pho in the Ballantyne area. My husband and I have visited twice already and loved it both times! Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Me and my boyfriend went here on a Friday night and we were served right away. The broth base for the pho tastes incredibly authentic and it was a huge portion. My boyfriend (who has insatiable hunger) got the vermicelli noodles and could barely finish. The service was great and the owner was very friendly - stop by and check this place out! :)"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is my new favorite place for Pho. Went tonight for dinner after the girls next door shared with me their menu during my pedicure.  The girl at the counter was super friendly and helped us decide what to order after we went back and forth with which Pho to try. We got the lemongrass pork belly skewers which were delicious and a perfect appetizer.  For dinner we both ordered the #11, meat Pho in a spicy beef broth.  It was out of this world! So flavorful and hearty.  The owner was so nice and brought out a complimentary bowl of the #9 (Pho with sliced filet mignon) after hearing us at the counter trying to decide which one sounded better. This one was delicious too, and how thoughtful to let us try it.  I'm so glad this is just up the street from my house, I will definitely be back, if not become a regular.  I suggest you take the advice of the other Yellpers and get over here soon! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Another example of following my YELP connections!   I keep seeing people checking into this restaurant on YELP.  Finally decided that I needed to check it out.  It became clear really quickly why everyone loves this place.  Simple ambiance, excellent PHO and curry dishes.  I had the pho with chicken broth and grilled chicken.  Very yummy, especially with the fresh lime and jalapeño on top.   One of the employees kept checking on us to make sure we were okay and had what we needed.  The place is intimate and filled with customers.  I wish they had a bigger space and a few more tables, but that was not a big issue.  I waited for five minutes to get a table, so it wasn't bad.  You seat yourself, so it's like first come first serve with the seating.  Overall, It was the bomb, pho sure."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say I'm not a pho connoisseur but this is the best I've had in Charlotte. It's pretty close to my office so I like to go when I'm feeling sick or it's really cold/gloomy outside. Something about this soup is really comforting! I have only tried the chicken pho (pho ga) and it's amazing. They give you all the accoutrements on the side so you can add as much or as little as you want. There's also Sriracha and hoisin sauce available if you need some more spice or flavor. The people who work here are so nice and were very patient with me the first time I went. The restaurant itself is pretty small but that adds to the charm in my opinion. Definitely check this place out if you're in the mood for pho!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my wive's inlaws and looks for something near by for luncha and saw this place on yelp with great reviews so I knew I had to try it.    The place This place is pretty small however very clean which is a plus! It was also very busy when I went in on a weekday for lunch also a good sign. There are only are a few booths, tables and a couple counter chairs.  The staff I actually talked to 3 people in there and all were very friendly and helpful kudos to the staff  The food I do not consider myself a Vietnamese expert by any means but I have had my share of Pho and wow was this good!!   Great broth, the filet was cooked medium just as I asked. They do not skimp on the quantity which I loved!!! The pho comes with the usual things found in pho all the stuff tasted fresh.  The verdict  I am a fan great service, prices and food what else could you want????"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Ballantyne!! My favorite spicy noodle is best out of all! I like it with extra spicy sauce on the side, and the flavor of soup is awesome! The soup goes well with cold weather and keep me warm and comfortable. The service and atmosphere of this restaurant are beyond any of the Vietnamese restaurant in charlotte! Highly recommend people bring their friend to try this spicy noodle soup!"}
{"text":"I and the spicy noodle bowl and it was so good! I even had enough to eat later for dinner. My friend had one of the sandwiches and she let me have a bite and that was equally good. It's a small place, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Closed on Tuesdays. How random. I found out the hard way. Food is still pretty good. Sanitation score could stand to be a little higher."}
{"text":"After seeing all the glowing recommendations I had to try it on a rainy day, mid week where I felt like nothing would do except for a steaming hot bowl of pho.    Sweetie, not being an enjoyer of pho and a vegetarian came with.  She had the tofu with veggies.  She loved the veggies, the tofu not so much.  It seemed like it was fermented or something and didn't like the taste.  No matter, we said something to the young lady working and her Mom gave us a nice to go box of more veggies which was very nice of them.  Well played Be's!  I had the Chicken Pho which was amazing.  Just what I needed.  Flavorful broth, chicken and everything else just went together.  They gave me extra bean sprouts and a nice sprig of basil to add on my own.  I stayed away from the jalapenos but they looked fresh.  I really liked it here.  Very nice and accommodating.  This place is a welcome addition to the area and I hope they're able to keep the word out so they stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Concord and would do it again. Sandwiches awesome.,Combination bun and egg rolls to die for. Fresh and crispy bread.Please open one in Concord."}
{"text":"So - they worked out the few, minimal, new restaurant kinks.  One of our favorite spots in CLT regardless of price...AND one of the best bargains in town!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This was a nice accidental find.  Very fresh and delicious!  Fast and causal dining, with a super friendly and nice staff.  We ordered the combo noodles and it was amazing. Wished they had bubble tea but I hold it against them."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp!!! WOW!! What a find...The filet Pho is out of this world! I love spicy and when the nicest little guy offered to bring me chili peppers, that his mom grows in the back yard, I was all over it! Boy were they tasty and quite spicy!! The place is spotless, which is very important to me! The menu is simple and not overwhelming. I can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food. We went in for lunch on a Friday and had the vermicelli combo bowls.  The pork was well seasoned and the spring roll in the dish was seasoned exceptionally. We will definitely come back.  Great service and multiple people came by to ask us if our food was ok.  A+"}
{"text":"This place is ON POINT! We normally frequent  Viet Thai in Pineville but they are closed on Monday's. So we found this new place to try. I was really worried because Viet Thai is THE BEST. It's seriously my fave. It's a little chilly out today & I was craving this so I was hoping they didn't disappoint. THEY DIDN'T!!!   Not gonna lie I actually like this a little bit better. The chicken in my pho had better flavor. You walk in & order at the counter. Seat yourself & it comes out fast. It's a little better pricing too!  So I've found a new favorite pho place & I'm loyal so that's saying A LOT for me to convert.   Try them out.... you won't be disappointed!  P.S. Try the coffee! #amazing"}
{"text":"Great Pho. Nice people. Wish their Bahn Mi was better, had it twice hoping it was me, but it's not."}
{"text":"I tried Pho for the first time here & also the chicken banh mi & they were both phenomenal! I highly recommend this place. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and will definitely come back! We got the Tofu Curry (spicy) and Filet Mignon Pho which were both fantastic. The people working there are soooo nice too. On our way out we noticed them eating some exotic fruit and asked about it. They have is some to try and while I'm not sure what they are called... again so yummy! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Family owned and best pho you will find in south Charlotte! I usually venture out to Central Ave for the best Vietnamese restaurants in town but Be's is the only great one in the Ballantyne area! Super clean and modern. Love the pho and Banh mi's - everything was very clean tasting and not greasy at all. Very casual atmosphere and gets busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say.  Beautiful light and flavorful beef broth.  Have had the pho 3 times now.  It is amazing and portions, even of the beef, are very generous.  Take out was just as good as in restaurant.  Hope they can maintain the quality.  Had the pork belly skewers.  They were not my favorite but I just think I don't really like pork belly.  My problem, not theirs.  Will be a regular customer for sure."}
{"text":"So glad that this place has opened, and so close to my place!  The interior was really clean and comfortable.  Staff were super nice.  The fellow at the cash register took his time explaining everything on the menu.  I like the concept of ordering at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  Food was excellent.  Had the lemongrass pork belly appetizer.  It was delicious. It was the main \"meal\" for my young daughter.  The staff were nice enough to bring out not only the spicy sauce it is usually served with, but also a special peanut sauce and fish sauce that were not spicy.  She loved the peanut sauce.  Pho was amazing.  Among the best I have had anywhere.  Broth was clear and very rich. Lots of meat, more than other places will serve.  Brisket was great, meatballs very nice, and the filet was really tender.  I wish they offered tendon as an option for the Pho, and that they included jalapeños with the accompaniments for the Pho.  Maybe they just ran out.  Happy to see a steady stream of customers when I was there.  Hopefully this place sticks around, as I really want to get back there soon and try other menu items.  Bun and Banh Mi for sure."}
{"text":"First, I'm not a pho connoisseur (I'm a LI pizza snob) however, the spicy beef pho was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  ONLY because I don't eat pork, I ordered the chicken banh mi, delicious.   I've tried Viet Thai & Le's Sandwiches because I find the cuisine intriguing, Be's surpassed both.  The newly opened restaurant was spotless, (and sadly empty at 5pm) the manager was attentive, genuinely pleasant and explained how to assemble the pho at home.  I was even introduced to Be herself.   Another employee insisted on carrying my order out to my car.  This place is a gem!!!  I will be back.  Best of luck, amazing service!"}
{"text":"I've given this restaurant 3 chances and tried 3 different dishes. I don't get the high rating. The food is decent, but it's not very flavorful in my opinion. They use fresh ingredients, so that's a plus, but they need to punch up the spices or something. Very clean place and the staff are friendly enough."}
{"text":"On the one hand, this is not your typical Vietnamese place, because it's tucked into a corner of a strip mall, and it's also relatively new, where many similar locations are, well, less than new. On the other hand, plenty of similar shops are in locations that are just about the same, but they've been there for what seems to be years, only they are in - shall we say - a bit more disrepair.   In this case, it's an unexpected, though refreshing, change. You almost expect to be utterly disappointed because a tasty meal could not come from such a well-kept and shiny place. Luckily the staff is friendly and patient as you order from nicely arranged menu boards, and happily bring you fresh plates (or bowls) out, with dishes that compare well to compatriots in other establishments, and the prices are in line as well, making it an excellent place to visit."}
{"text":"Yum! The hubs was craving pho and we decided to stop by here. It's an excellent addition to ballantyne. The staff was friendly and gave great options. The restaurant is small but it's perfect. We started off with the spring rolls. They were good but lukewarm. I ordered the spicy beef pho. The meat was very tender. The broth was savory and had just the right amount of spice. My husband also liked his pho. We were both pleased and it was the perfect time to get pho with the weather and all. Overall, this place is great and we would definitely hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had in Charlotte! On a cold January night, it's exactly what I needed to warm up. I got the Pho Tai and my friend got the Pho Combo, it was so good! The herbs they give were fresh and abundant. The restaurant was busy but service was quick and friendly. I will definitely return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Decent spot to get pho if you're near the area. I got my pho to go it was pretty good but I think it be better if I ate it there. I will update my review when I go back. I haven't tried to banh mi here but my Vietnamese friend said it's no good (they don't have pickled veggies). It's quite pricy than other places I've been too for better food so unless I'm too lazy to do the drive to another I wouldn't order here. I gave it three stars because the pho was pretty good to go, staff was very friendly, and technology was more updated than other Viet places I've been to."}
{"text":"Maybe a 3.50 really but went 4 because of the value. My kids had the sliced filet mignon Pho and it was really good and a ton of broth with lots of fixin's to dress it up how you like it. They both ate all of the meat and a bunch of noodles and still a good lunch the next day.   Wife and I both had the curry rice. She went Tofu and I went chicken.Loved the flavor on the curry. I mixed in nearly all of the rice eventually to make sure I ate all of the sauce. The chicken was pretty dry which would be my only complaint with the whole place. Nearly every dish is about $10 so again a good value. Clean, new and very good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here back in March for my birthday.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  I am from California and was looking for some yummy Vietnamese food.  We had combination pho, combination vermicilli, and summer rolls. We shared everything. We really liked the meatballs in the pho a lot.  Everything was very tasty."}
{"text":"Good Banh Mi. Little much on the mayo.  And I'm not a Pho or Banh Mi expert or anything so...but I'm sorry, I just still have a special place in my heart for Le's in the Plaza Midwood Noda area. Nobody throws down on those sandwiches like his Banh Mi joint. But, this place is good. I went back to try the Pho. Was ok. Will do."}
{"text":"Super tasty pho!! Quick service and large portions (like most pho places). My mom who usually doesn't care for it, LOVED it! We will be going back (: ...after we get through pur leftovers."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to get Pho now. The Pho is full of flavor and they give you a huge portion. I definitely will recommend this place to all my friends it is delicious . We also had the lemongrass chicken Bahn mi as well as the pork rice bowl. Nothing we had was nasty. The staff was very helpful and friendly being that it was our first time in. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was busy, which was a good sign to me. The banh mi was amazing and the pho tai that I ordered didn't disappoint! The prices were very reasonable as well. I plan on going back again very soon because I'm craving more"}
{"text":"Read about this place on the new recommended Yelp newsletter. I am a big fan of Vietnamese food and I prefer the authentic kind. This places promises good quality.  The owner is very friendly and the staff is attentive and kind. The place is modern, fresh and clean. And the staff really cares about their customers and the place. Bathrooms are clean. Ample parking in front of the place.  Now to the food. There are options between Vietnamese sandwiches, pho, rice plates and appetizers. I love good summer rolls. Here they call them spring rolls. The summer rolls come with fresh big shrimp pieces! Wow! Generally this is where many places save on the fish not here. The spring rolls come with a peanut sauce. I then ordered a spicy noodle pho for $11. And when she brought the bowl to the table, I was surprised and happy. It was so large and so worth the money. It comes with a plate of fresh cabbage, basil and lime. Sauces are available on each table too. I ended up taking the rest of the soup home. I also had the egg rolls with pork with a very interesting and yummy side sauce. Sooo good.   I had a wonderful experience and since I don't frequent in this area much, I will come here when I am in the area or if I crave some good Vietnamese food. But it is definitely worth the drive for me. A new location will be opening around May close to uptown, this will be much closer for me."}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since my last review so I guess it's time for another one.   I ordered takeout the other day for my mom and I. We wanted a little variety so she ordered the Pho Ga & I ordered the Tofu Vermicelli. We also decided to split a Tofu Banh Mi.   I was the only customer in the restaurant besides someone who was finishing up their food. My order took about 15 minutes to get prepared but I guess it was because they had a few call-in orders. The girl at the counter was friendly & patient with me asking questions and leaving stuff out (no cilantro, no mayo, no onions). Everything was packed up nicely.   My mom enjoyed her Pho Ga. There was plenty of chicken in the soup and she said the broth didn't have any msg flavor. The pho condiments were very fresh and I added a few basil leaves to my vermicelli dish.   Tofu Vermicelli was super tasty but different. The tofu had a lemongrass flavor to it and it wasn't just the standard lettuce, pickled carrots and daikon, bean sprouts, & cucumbers in it. It also had broccoli, string beans, and snow peas- vegetables that don't normally come with this dish, making it seem less authentic. I forgot to tell them to leave out the mint, but it was a good thing I forgot because the flavor was not overpowering & very refreshing. Fish sauce was great too.   Now the not so good. I ordered the Tofu Banh Mi without the mayo or cilantro but the pickled carrots and daikon (my favorite part!) were sadly left out. The baguette was a little soggy but that may have been due to the tofu in it. The tofu was the best part. It has the same lemongrass flavor that my vermicelli noodles had. The worst part (for me) was that when I was almost done eating my half of the banh mi, I noticed some meat-like thing at the bottom of the sandwich. My mom and I had no idea what it was (I was thinking pork/pate but she thought it was kind of fishy) but it totally ruined it for me. I guess in all fairness the menu did not say VEGETARIAN Tofu Banh Mi, but you just don't expect there to be meat in a tofu banh mi.   Overall food was pretty good, besides the banh mi. If I'm craving vermicelli noodles but I don't want to drive too far out, I'd be happy to come here again. I would just ask for the standard vegetables though. If I want a banh mi, I'll just stick with Crispy Banh Mi on South Blvd."}
{"text":"These noodles in Bon Mi is a great place to go for fresh Vietnamese food. The vermicelli with the pork Saturday and the shrimp was delicious. All ingredients appeared to be very fresh and tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"My son and I went here when he was home from college after reading the reviews. It's not a very large place and we were glad we got there early since it filled up fast. You order at the counter and take a seat and your food is brought to your table. The good is really good and there's plenty of it!"}
{"text":"This area has lacked really good ethnic food. This is a great start, and the food is killa."}
{"text":"Wow what a great spot. Food is great and so is the service. Try the lemongrass grilled pork sandwich it's amazing."}
{"text":"The tofu sandwich is one of the best things I have ever eaten.  From the outside this place doesn't look like much but don't let that fool you.  The staff is friendly and the inside is clean.  I also highly recommend the tofu and rice.  There are so many flavors going on in each bite.  We will be back for sure.  So glad we have found real authentic Vietnamese food with staff that understands what customer service is really all about."}
{"text":"In August, I moved to Charlotte from Newport Beach, CA and immediately began searching for the things that I love back at home. Since then, I had gotten used to disappointment as I tried many of the top rated Vietnamese restaurants in the area and nothing tasted as good as home. Today, that changed when I tried Be's Noodles in Ballantyne which just opened 2 days ago. The pho at Be's is delicious and flavorful and reminds me of home. The broth is prepared from beef bones, not powders or pastes. I also had the spring rolls which are excellent and made with care. The thai basil, jalepeno and bean sprout condiments at Be's are plentiful and fresh. The interior of this brand new restaurant is bright and welcoming. I look forward to many hot bowls of pho coming out of Be's kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is great and its still fairly new. I ordered the filet mignon and highly recommend you to try it as well. I I brought some left overs to work and my coworkers loved it. So much so that they went there for lunch the next day. It's a nice and very clean place.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. It looks good, it was busy and I was there at an off time. Definitely good signs. I order the lemongrass pork banh mi. I asked to add pate and they were out. The pork was burnt tasting. I'll give them another shot but it wasn't the wow I was hoping for."}
{"text":"The banh mi sandwich is delicious (chicken.) I got it without mayo and extra hot sauce..... Soooooo good. We did get the spring rolls, unfortunately, the vein was not removed which is very off putting. We got the food take out, else would have sent it back."}
{"text":"Fast, great good, affordable! What more can you ask for!! We take family here twice a month. Simply. Great. Food."}
{"text":"I ordered the egg rolls and lemongrass pork Banh mi. Ugh, so so good! I'm only here for two more days, but am considering going back again for lunch and trying some noodles it was that good!   Also the owner is very nice, she spoke to everyone of her customers and asked how their meal was. I loved it all."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I have been craving some pho, but really good, soothe my soul pho. This place is bright, clean and the employees and so nice and helpful. You have to order some of their pork belly. I actually recommend getting 2 orders of it, it's so good! Two skewers of pork belly come in an order. I just wish that they were a bit bigger in portion, hence asking for 2 orders. The pho, oh the pho! Very simple, and delicious. We both ordered the combination and it did not disappoint! Delicious broth that doesn't middle the flavors of the meats in the soup. They gave me extra meatballs in mine since I didn't want the brisket. The portions are very generous and next time we will share a bowl of pho so that we can order a bahn mi and a bun bowl which looked delicious. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious vermicelli bowls, crispy, flavorful spring rolls, and service with a smile. Best basic Vietnamese I've found in Charlotte so far after relocating from Washington, DC."}
{"text":"Omg sooo delish! We ordered the crispy egg rolls ... sooo good they were stuffed with a lot of meat and super crispy!!! Lemongrass bahnmi sandwich .. this on was just ok .. I have had better but still was good I just wouldn't order it again... we ordered 3 diff types of pho .. meatball, filet minon, and the chicken omg the portion is huge they give you plenty of noodles and the broth ... omg the broth is soooooo good I felt like I was eating pho from VA of was perfect!!! Last but not least we had the grilled pork chop with rice and the flavor was awesome!!!!!! The meat was tender and marinated perfectly!!!! It seems like the the owner does the cooking so it tastes like grandmas cooking!! Anyway everything was great and we will def be back very soon!!! I just they would add in some viet specialty drinks on the menu but not that serious I guess lol can't wait to go back ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Ballantyne. The service was fast and very friendly. Food was fantastic. We will definitely be back.  Spring rolls, pho ga and banh mi were fresh, flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Be's!  The owner is super friendly and talks to us every time she is there.  The food is amazing, authentic, and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and went straight for the \"classic\" Bahn Mi, making only one customization and that was to skip the jalapenos. A few minutes later, my sandwich was brought to me at the table, fresh.  It was perfect. The bread was crunchy and crumbly on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The meat, the cheese and the veggies were fresh tasting and loaded with flavor. The veggies were especially crispy and crunchy. It was an EXCELLENT sandwich.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good pho. Grilled pork is also very good. It's a walk up to Order and they bring to food to you place with good seating."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  I love the filet mignon Pho.  The steak is thinly sliced and so good in the broth.  Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  My wife loves the Chicken Pho which I agree is good but not as flavorful as the beef broth.  The service here is what really sets this place apart.  They always make you feel so welcome and check on you throughout to make sure everything is good.  We invited my mother and sister to try it and the manager brought us out a tray of Bahn Mi sandwiches to try which were delicious and really meant a lot!  My family and I are now customers for life!"}
{"text":"AH-MAZIng Pho Ga (chicken Pho), excellent customer service, friendly multicultural staff. I will be back with my husband!"}
{"text":"Easy in and out and the food that shows up in the middle is fantastic! I love watching the fire roar under my perfect Bahn Mi sandwich and the anticipation builds as it's brought to the table. The PERFECT combination of flavors, Be's has one of the best Bahn Mi sandwiches in Charlotte. Don't let all the other reviews from various restaurants fool you. Try the Bahn Mi at Be's Noodles and let that one be the benchmark for all the others."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not bad, but not impressive either. Kind of slow. Does not have too much variety. Will come here when I'm in the area and happen to crave for pho. Won't drive all the way for the food. Pho Hua, Pho Real, even Sigon Palace are all way better options."}
