{"text":"I came across this place while I was hungry looking for anything to eat really. I hadn't had fried chicken in a while so my craving kicked in. I ordered the original fried chicken with no spices. The food did take longer to prepare compared to other fast food places like McDonalds, but that was understandable because they're preparing the food on the spot instead of letting it sit in the air. However, when I finally took a bite into the fried chicken, I slowly began to lose my appetite. I found that I was eating more fried batter than chicken and that overall, it was far too seasoned for me to enjoy.  For future improvements, I would definitely suggest having different options for the intensity of their seasoning as I typically prefer my food lightly seasoned."}
{"text":"We ordered the popcorn chicken for $6.99 in medium spicy level. While the order took a little long (only a few patrons), the flavour made up for it. They make the chicken fresh.   I would describe the seasoning as eating instant noodles on fried chicken. Portion size was good for the price.   This is comparable to the ones I had in Taiwan. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Bones bones and more bones. Definitely not chicken breast they used despite their huge ad/poster clearly says \"use only chicken breast\".   We ordered one mild spicy and one original. Guess what both tastes exactly same. Kinda sweet and salty and I taste no other flavours.   Will not likely going back."}
{"text":"Went to this location for a late lunch over the weekend and ordered the chicken combo with salt and pepper, and a strawberry soda.    The chicken was super soft and juicy with amazing flavour.  It tastes like popcorn chicken from bubble tea places but is much larger in size and maybe healthier (don't quote me on that).  The strawberry soda was really good as well.  I like this place but only gave it 4 stars because I probably can't eat this every day as it is fried.  With that being said I really enjoyed it and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love fried chicken?!?  Hot star does a pretty good rendition of fried chicken. Each order is made fresh so you can be sure that your chicken will come out piping hot. There are a variety of flavours (I have tried both the salt and pepper and the spicy which were both good - you can pick the level of spiciness). The coating is where most of the flavour lives and it is thicker than other fried chicken you may have tried. While the coating is still crispy there is also a chewy quality to it. I suppose it's a matter of preference whether you like this type of coating or not.   The chicken comes as a flattened piece which makes it easy to consume with your hands, but as others have noted, there will be some bones to contend with which can be a bit of a nuisance.   The location isn't all that large, but I have had no trouble finding a seat to consume my chicken the two times I have gone to this location. The staff have always been friendly.  There seems to be a good mix of both take-out and eat-in customers. Overall, I would characterize the experience as a snack vs. a proper meal.   The prices are reasonable for what you get and overall, if you are craving some hot and flavourful fried chicken (and who doesn't absolutely crave fried chicken every now and again), I would recommend Hot Star."}
{"text":"Ok we are talking about fried chicken but this chain has its own way to make it and it's nothing like the others chains we have in GTA. First of all this is a Taiwanese chain. The main dish here is a large fried chicken, crispy in a very original way. The entire recipe is something different and sure the results is a success. Another good thing about this place is that your dish is served pretty quickly about 6-7 min and served hot in a small bag, because of that it is fresh and juicy. Definitely worth a visit if you are a chicken lover."}
{"text":"Got their regular spiced chicken and the crispy fried chicken and it was really good up until the point you take a bite and discover all the bones were still in it. It would've been much better if they made some effort to remove the bones as it got difficult to enjoy when we had to remove the bones off the HOT piece of chicken..   Both crispy and regular chicken was well seasoned. I preferred the regular fried chicken- the crispy chicken was quite greasy."}
{"text":"I do LOVE this place and whenever I don't know what to snack on, this is my go to.  Having said that, this review is mainly based on the \"Extra Spicy\" flavour which is mainly just heavily doused paprika/cayenne.  I don't know what cayenne they used, because it was not spicy at all, but completely red.   Definitely tasted more like paprika, and it took away from the great original seasoning.  Even tho theres a bone at the bottom (which IS disappointing, the chicken is juicy and the skin just tastes so good (as long as u don't get extra spicy)."}
{"text":"Visited Hot Star on a weekday night for some delicious fried chicken. It is located on the second floor of Pacific Mall's food court.   I ordered the XXL Large Fried Chicken with plum seasoning along with a Green Apple Yogurt drink. My order was ready shortly after I ordered and I could tell it was freshly made since the chicken was piping hot and needed to cool down before I could start eating.  I loved the plum flavour as it tastes great with the chicken and was pretty flavourful. The chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The Green Apple Yogurt drink was refreshing and complemented nicely with the chicken. I know I will surely be back the next time I'm craving for some crispy fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Pretty large chicken... very crispy and tasty... medium spicy with curry, was not spicy at all... and piece came with a pretty large bone.. if your $10 came with fries or a bun i would have recommend it more..  place is clean, takes about 5-7 minutes to get your order Maybe I will come back.. I want to try their drink and fried mushrooms"}
{"text":"Glad to know it's open in uptown at the first moment, since I was quite enjoying their fried chicken in Yonge/Dundas location. I have tried their fried chicken in Pmall location for 3 times since they are open.  First time, it tasted just same as ones I bought in downtown location. Second time, it was overlooked, not juicy at all, chicken wasn't fresh, I asked for very little spicy, but it turned out to be very spicy, I can see lots of red pepper powder in my fried chicken but barely pepper&salt. I went to order one this afternoon again, and they disappointed me again, chicken wasn't fresh, and this time, I asked for mild, when I opened the bag, there is barely any pepper&salt in my fried chicken, it tastes just plain.  $9.99 before tax for a piece of chicken is quite pricy compared to restaurants in GTA area, and their inconsistent quality isn't worth it. Won't purchase their fried chicken in this location any more."}
{"text":"First time trying Hot-Star now that they opened their new location in North York. Ordered their original fried chicken with medium spice. Shell was crispy, some areas were too doughy, chicken was juicy and full of flavours. It wasn't spicy at all even though I ordered medium spice, and near the end there was a piece of bone which I didnt know until I bit into it.   After you put in your order, it's a little bit of a wait till you get your food, and inside has limited seats to sit down.   It's a little overpriced (9.99+tax) for the chicken that doesn't come with a drink or a side.   There are a few selected flavours you can choose from for the chicken, and other food options on the menu. Drinks are also available.   Overall, it was a good experience, and service was good.   Would I go back?  - maybe once in a while to try other things on the menu  Would I recommend this place to other people? - yes"}
{"text":"XXL for sure!!  Probably the most fast food chain themed food stand found in Pacific Mall food court upstairs. With large baby blue and white signs- it is hard to miss compared to the more authentic noodle booths surrounding it. If anybody know's that food court is extremely packed and hard to find seating- so it is convenient that these GINORMOUS fried chicken come in a bag that you could just walk and munch along.  It was $9.99 and i guess the price is justified for what basically is almost a whole chicken. I read some reviews beforehand and knew to ask for the \"hot\" spices on both sides. It was really good- my only qualm was I wish there was some garnish or hot sauce or ketchup that I could compliment my chicken with. As it was delicious to eat at first but after going thru half of it- mouth was getting a bit dry. Also it was a bit of a surprise to find out that when you get to the end - that there is still bone in. Found out the hard way- didnt mind. Marinated very well- crispy and lots of meat. It was nice.  It was definitely worth the try and everyone on my snap chat was going crazy about it. However- it is a once in a while kind of item (list of novelty trends to try). I will be back at popeye's for my regular dosage of fried chicken and be back at Hot Star in maybe 6 months or so."}
{"text":"Fried chicken never disappoints! Hot Star is a large chain across Asia, and I first had it on Yonge Street near Church. This North York location was much larger but the aesthetics were clean and modern. The store itself can seat maybe up to 10 people, but I guess they're taking on the 'Asia feel' where you order and head out.  Their fried chicken was quite good and not overly oily. It was also freshly made to order and super hot. I had combo 1 for the large hot star chicken and \"medium\" spicy. It wasn't that spicy, and honestly I would've called it more mild. At the very bottom of the chicken, there is a bone, which gets somewhat messy, so I suggest getting extra napkins for that part!  Combo 1 came with a drink, which I ordered the Sunrise drink. The drink itself was like strawberry soda and actually mixed quite well. The drink itself would've been $4.49 +tax, but the total cost of the combo was $13.99.  I've heard that they now serve deep fried chicken with cheese centres. I wish I had waited a couple of days to go into this hot star to get to try it!  I would definitely come back for it.. or maybe a popcorn chicken order if I'm not too hungry!"}
{"text":"This was definitely a large piece of chicken. It was fried fresh so there a bit of a wait when receiving the chicken. I would say it has good flavours. The seasonings made it taste like a giant piece of popcorn chicken. Tender but super oily.  This is good to share between 2 people because you get tired of the flavour after a while.   Good if you're looking for protein and is craving popcorn chicken. Beware of the massive oiliness"}
{"text":"Similar to seeing featured films on the walls at Cineplex, you'll see large, low-resolution photos of their chicken and drinks lining the walls in a tiny space with a few plastic tables and chairs.  There is really nothing special about this take out restaurant's decor. The 10 minute wait for your food to be prepared is also a suffocating thought.    However, their portable chicken items are better than many of the products from the other fried chicken contenders.  The skin is crispy, the wrapper is easy to maneuver, and you can actually taste a spicy kick unlike what you would find at places like Cheers Cut, where the chicken is thin, bland, and desolate of crispiness.  There are several flavours to choose from, including plum and spicy, so you can find a taste for every chicken lover.  Just be careful: the chicken is made fresh, so you can easily get burned if you touch the large slab of chicken too much while eating it on the go. Bring wetnaps as well!"}
{"text":"It is good in Asia, but not in Canada. Expensive, and low quality. You can have a whole meal in other restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to try here because I'd seen the long queues at their Downtown location.  There wasn't a queue here but it was a Monday afternoon.  We went for the original XXL fried chicken breast.  I asked the lady what the difference was between original and crispy.  She said that crispy had no panko.  We also ordered it medium spicy.(spice level is determined by how much they shake on, after it's fried).  The chicken itself is ok(for white meat).  But I'm a dark meat fan and it's impossible to eat this by yourself.  I ate it with 2 of my kids.  The chicken breast is huge, I wonder if the chickens are on steroids?!  I'm glad that I got to try it but it's not something i'd crave very often.  After a few bites you don't really want to eat much more."}
{"text":"Typical food chain but I enjoyed everything that we ordered. Parking can be a pain though! And oh, they only have limited seats inside."}
{"text":"Hot Star Large Fried Chicken is more of an order and sit place, service at the counter was average, the insides looked modern and was very clean with several tables and high chairs. Might be hard to eat with large groups here but this isn't really a place to have a nice dinner hangout with, this is better treated as a quick eat and go  Food *** I ordered their original large large fried chicken and while the taste was great and crispy, it's a bit hard to justify the $10 charge it comes with, especially since at the end there's a lot of bones. Even with a combo there are a lot of options around Finch for fried chicken where you can get more a bang for your buck. However, if you're craving Taiwanese style, this is a good go to for a pick up and quick eat.   Service *** You order and sit so not much to write regarding service, it was just ok  Ambiance ***** Store was new and looked super high tech, was very clean. Had a lot of high top chairs on the counter if you want to eat alone and some tables with 2-3 seats, felt very welcoming.   Tips/Closing comments - Good place to eat for a grab and go - Try their original large fried chicken! - Only cash for less than $5 - Only cash & debit between $5 and $10 - Cash, credit, or debit any purchase above $10"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We went in at 5 PM on a Saturday and they decided to do a changeover of the cashier till at that time, causing a huge line up to build. Nobody could order for a whole 15 minutes while they took their sweet time counting cash. Have heard decent things about their fried chicken but service is terrible and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a must try. Honestly, after trying their chicken, I crave it almost everyday! Talk about tasty, tender, juicy and addictive! The chicken is yay HUGE, but its too good to share. They use chicken breast but be careful, as closer to the end, you will find the bone. And even though they use chicken breast, the meat was still juicy and flavourful. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered the xxl chicken to share with my bf. The chicken is very moist and perfectly seasoned. Each order is made fresh so every order is HOT. Like others have said, it's a little bit hard to eat because of how big the chicken is and that it's bone in.   While the chicken did taste good, I didn't like that we were standing there for 20mins waiting for our order and the workers there just put our order into a bag and left it on the side with other orders. They didn't call out any number to let us know the order was ready. It wasn't until my bf went up to the counter and asked if our order was ready and showed the receipt that the guy looked through the chicken orders and handed him our order."}
{"text":"I always pass by the hot star large fried chicken in downtown Toronto, but I never felt too hungry to try it out. I'm glad this hot star large fried chicken opened up in non other than the very famous Pacific Mall.  My friend really wanted to try out their popcorn chicken, which was $7.90. Their options were pepper salt and spicy. It was ready in about 2 minutes and there were about 20 pieces that came in a paper bag placed in a bag. I was able to tap visa with this, which was nice and convenient.   We got the salt and spicy one, it wasn't super oily, but I must say, it was more soggy than most popcorn chicken I've had. So, Kristy, it was sort of soggy, why still four stars? Cause this popcorn chicken ACTUALLY had a large piece of chicken in it. It was lightly coated with the outside shell, but there was actually a solid, large piece of chicken in there.  The taste was slightly salty for me, but it was really tasty and delicious."}
{"text":"Was quite interested to see what all the hype was about.  Pure noms were anticipated with high expectations.    Ordered the original fried chicken with sweet potato fries.  (The left overs tasted quite decent after.. )   Choose the spiciest seasoning they had and was a little disappointed as it seemed to be nothing short of Spanish paprika and some sort of mix of cayenne pepper. No idea but it wasn't that special an was sprinkled heavily on one side only didn't have any sort of authentic taste.    The sweet potato fries were the first to go..  That plum flavour somehow is greatly paired and savory.    It's fried chicken prepared in a different way but it wasn't anything I would be to have again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly. Breast.   Yeah. That about sums it up. Brownie points to whoever figures out why I put those two words up top..  This was my second time at this Hot Star location. I went about a month ago with two friends of mine. I'd known about Hot Star since they first opened in Toronto, but I didn't want to go downtown to try it. Then, when they opened up at Pacific Mall, I was going to try it, but at about $10 per large chicken cutlet, I was skeptical. I thought it would be mostly breading and a thin piece of chicken in the middle. The lines didn't encourage me to go either. I really don't like lining up for things. Then, this North York location came up and we went on a food crawl, so I figured we might as well. When our order came, I picked up one of the pieces of chicken and it was by far the heaviest cutlet I'd ever picked up. This thing is CHUNKY. I mean that in the best possible way. The breading was nice and crisp, and there was a very large piece of chicken inside. They use chicken breast, but it's the juiciest chicken breast I've ever had. I usually don't like chicken breast, but this is good stuff. It comes bone-in, so be careful. Oh. And they don't cut the chicken for you so that it's as hot and fresh as it can be when you eat it. If you want to cut it, they have knives.   We got one in seaweed flavor and one in plum flavor. It's not plum sauce. It's plum powder. We liked both, but all preferred the plum. It's nice to have some sweet with your savory chicken. The three of us had all of one and about a third of the second. I saved the rest for home. Defeated by large chicken cutlet.   Today, I went again with two more friends. They just got the cheese filled chicken cutlet at this location. We got two as well as both their blue curacao yogurt drink and their green apple drink, and an order of fries. The fries were wonderfully crispy on the outside, but could have done with a tad more seasoning. The drinks were tasty, in an artificially flavored kinda way. Think bubble tea yogurt drinks. The chicken still has the breast bones in it. It's not quite completely cheese filled. There's a pocket in one side of the cutlet that's filled with cheese. HOT. MOLTEN. CHEESE. We tried to take pictures of it. A two-person cheese pull. Fun stuff.  It'd be nice if these things were just a little bit cheaper, but given that it took two of us to finish two pieces of chicken and an order of fries, it isn't horrible on cost either.   All in all, good times and good chicken. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that Hot Star was in the food court of Pac Mall when I needed to get something on a Friday afternoon. The line was a bit long given that it was during the lunch hour. I ordered a salt & pepper original large fried chicken and a drink.   The chicken took 10 minutes to make so I knew it was fresh. Good thing there was a paper wrapping and plastic bag or else it would be messy. The chicken was nice and you know that it was real chicken instead of processed meat. The drink was just ok.  In the end, it was filling. The owner / cook was very accommodating as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"hot cheese fried chicken\" 20 minute wait for one order. After receiving the order, I cut into the chicken and the middle part was raw.   I brought it back to the counter, they made me another one.   Second time around, it was even more raw in the center and the cheese was not melted at all.   The guy at the counter explained that he \"usually leaves the chicken on top rack above the stove to keep it warm after being cooked, but this time he didn't\"; therefore it was more \"fresh\".   One star for good customer service at the least... and Got refund back... too bad didn't get my appetite back.   The hot cheese chicken is a fail because the chicken isn't really same thickness throughout.. which is why it probably isn't cooked thoroughly.   They should invest in a meat thermometer to ensure the meat is cooked thoroughly"}
{"text":"Mine and my boyfriend's first time having this! It is definitely something I can say, is worth it - and has good taste. We started the visit off by walking from our parking spot (thank god) and into this heavenly joint that hit us with a whaff of deep fried oily goodness. If the smell doesn't get you, I don't know what will. This isn't something you can have every day (kudos if you do)   He got the crispy fried cutlet with seaweed seasoning while I got the original cutlet with medium spiciness and S&P seasoning. I will say that the crispy fried chicken was much better tasting than the original, something him and I both thoroughly enjoyed. The chicken cutlet itself is enough for a meal, leaving us both full and grease filled with guilt. The original reminded me of Taiwanese popcorn chicken!   Total with 2 cans of coke to combat the 'hot air' was $28 and change. Wifi password is plastered on the walls and they have about 8 seats along the bar, 5 two seater tables.   I passed out from itis when we got home, so I'll be having salad for lunch tomorrow. Glad they opened all the way up at Yonge & Sheppard."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, polished space right at Yonge/Finch. Fits around 12 people with a good amount extra space to spare unlike other restaurants in the area.  I've wanted to try this place for awhile and glad I did! I didn't realize there was more than just the original & spicy flavour. Unfortunately couldn't do a half half combination (wanted to try half original and half seaweed) but went with the cashier's recommendation of getting the original. I guess they fry it fresh b/c I had to wait 5 min for my order.  Original Large Fried Chicken (~$9.99)  It states salt and pepper but it smells like a light version of Five Spice. The chicken portion was humongous. It's a thin piece but  has a huge surface area with an equal ratio of breading and meat. The meat was juicy, FRESH, and not super oily! Expected the bag to be drenched in oil but it wasn't. Perfectly seasoned breading; not too salty. Bonus cartilage too! (1/5 of the chicken was bone)  Green Apple Yogurt (~$4.49) Got this as recommended by Yelp. I usually don't like Yogurt drinks b/c it's overpowering in flavour and leaves an unpleasant tacky sweetness but this was diff; I would order this again. Has a delicious smoothness  TL;DR nothing bad to say. I'd get this over Taiwanese popcorn chicken from other places in the area since the portion is bigger and tastes so much better since they use legit chicken breast meat"}
{"text":"Loved coming here for a Hot-Star Fried Chicken fix. I think the original flavour and the spicy flavours taste the best, but not so much the seaweed which is a little bland. There are inconsistency issues. First time it was great (Chicken was juicy), second time it was too dry, but the seasoning and the fried batter was still excellent!"}
{"text":"Come here for the chicken, not for the service or ambience. It's a fast food joint kind of vibe with blinding bright lights and the staff is quite slow and expressionless. I came around 10.30pm on a Friday night and we were the only ones there. The staff didn't seem to quite explain the process well and there might have been a slight language barrier.   I got the large deep fried chicken filet. and yes it does take 15-20 mins to make. but when it comes out it is HOT! Crispy on the outside so very juicy on the inside. The thing is the size of my face and the grease seeps into the paper bag. Its not glamorous because you're literally eating chicken out of a plastic bag. The bone is at the very bottom but its 1 big bone so its not hard to eat, its basically all meat till the bottom. Eat it all at once, because its not going to be crispy anymore after you re-heat it. But yeah if you are craving dirty greasy fried food this is it. Yes its overpriced, overrated but hits all the spots when you need something like this!"}
{"text":"I came here last night because my friend had cravings for Hot Star. I have never been myself but have received conflicting reviews of how amazing it is. I found myself somewhere in the middle of the OMG IT IS AMAZING and the OMG IT IS SO OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED scale.  I ordered the crunchy version since my friend ordered the original. I asked for extra spicy because I like unlocking my superpower of spitting fire when fed sufficient spice. The extra spicy option tasted more paprika-y than it did cayenne spicy. The spice was so mild I downed the whole thing without drinking anything while sitting at Hot Star. Be careful when eating it, they fry it fresh to order so even though it's not spicy, it's definitely hot!  Eating the chicken was a bit messy to me  because the chicken is fried bone-in. I know they can debone the chicken to make it much more convenient to eat but I guess that would increase the cost of the chicken since deboning will take more time vs their current method. Had the chicken been fried boneless, I think I would've given this a 4.  I do enjoy the crunchy skin more so than the original, but I found myself bored of eating it once I was done 1/2 of i. I also think $10 for a Taiwanese style chicken schnitzel is a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Purchased chicken from here several times and it has been consistently too salty. Would not recommend. A disaapointment"}
{"text":"I was at pmall today and I had to eat at their food court. For some reason, I JUST noticed this place today. I was actually here on Saturday so yeah I have no idea why I didn't see this place. There was even a giant picture of fried chicken behind the counter (hard to miss but surprisingly I did LOOOL) Anyways I was a little skeptical to try this place because one, I was worried their fried chicken was gonna be dry (i ain't up for that) and two, it's only one big piece of fried chicken for like what $10 which to me is hubba hubba....no rice? no drink? That's pretty fucking expensive. (in my non-existent book)  I didn't end up getting the chicken. However, I did get their fries which were $2.99 (some boys next to me were eating them and it looked glorious) and this green apple yogurt drink (L for around $5). The fries were actually pretty good. They ALMOST taste like the fries at Costco. NICE AND CRISPY OUTSIDE. MMM Definitely freshly fried and made to almost perfection. I just wished the inside was more umm..fleshy? IS THT THE RIGHT WORD IDK BUT IDC. The drink was meh. Personally a lil too sweet for me BUT YEAH   Generally an okay place for some good fries. Fried chicken? I have no idea. LOL"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed at this trendy deep fried chicken. If you plan on trying it out, make sure that you have time to wait for the chicken to be cooked (~15 minutes). I ordered the cheese stuffed fried chicken and although super cheesy, the entire thing was super salty. I was dehydrated pretty much 1/4 of the way through. The batter has an unusual flavor if you haven't had taiwanese food before - it's pretty sweet in comparison to American fried chicken like KFC or popeyes. It has plum salt on it, which is sweet and tangy and honestly, ruined it for me. I'm not sure if they had mistakenly added it on since there is an option to order chicken seasoned with plum powder.  Seating is limited so be sure to come during off hours. And do not order the fries - costco style fries for triple the price and bitter. For the price, it's definitely not worth it. This is more of a one time purchase - buy into the fad, try it out, and be done with it."}
{"text":"Is it suppose to be sweet?  I got the curry and the spicy chicken. It's my first time trying it, So I don't know what to expect.  The curry taste like sweet doughnut. While the spicy one is a bit spicy from the outside but sweet from the inside. (The taste is confusing me). Both chicken has bones in it too.    If it taste sweet then they're doing it right.  If not then I'm not sure what else to say.  Its good to try though.  Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from someone who knows his food.  This is a great concept.  What could be better than having Popeyes takeout?  Having it in a bag and eating it in your car!!  Love this concept.  Bagged fried chicken!!  How can you go wrong right?  Well let me tell you how you can go wrong.  When you order something that says \"salt and pepper\" you expect plain salt and pepper right?  Not here.  You get that asian 5 spice.  If I wanted my bagged chicken to taste like the air down Spadina I would order it that way.  But salt and pepper means salt and Pepper.   Change that salt and pepper to asian 5 spice and I will give you 4 stars.  Dum dums.  Also the bones in the meat need to screw off."}
{"text":"They have Costco style fries. Yes that's the key point. These fries go perfect with the giant fried chicken. The chicken taste has a sweet under taste, so keep that in mind when ordering flavours like seaweed - which was actually strangely sweet. Otherwise it's such a satisfying experience. It's like endless bites of fried chicken - What's not to love? I recommend the salt and pepper original flavour if it's your first time."}
{"text":"The chicken was good although it was a little pricey and took around 20 minutes to receive our order. We had ordered the cheese-stuffed fried chicken and while the meat was good, the cheese was all contained in one end of the chicken in a giant glob and not spread throughout. I was also surprised by the large number of bones in the chicken. Probably won't get the cheese-stuffed chicken again but I definitely want to try out some of the other menu options."}
{"text":"Their chicken is delicious but I feel the price is not really justified.. also, the bones left inside near the end kinda ruins the experience, to be honest. But like I said, the chicken is indeed tender and juicy. Sometimes there were parts of the chicken, especially near the end, that was just pure batter, and no meat, so that is also a concern. I would suggest people to try it but it's not a must-eat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got food poisoning from this place!!!  Ontop of that, It was mostly a big hunk of bone, little cheese, and the medium spicy option was not spicy at all! The chicken was oddly extremely sweet. Too expensive as well. Two \"cheese-filled\" deep fried chickens came to $29.00, with no sides or drinks.   Sorry, but this place is extremely over-hyped, expensive, and un-sanitary. Wish we never went here!!"}
{"text":"The chicken breast is good, but not as good as the one I ate in China. There are not many tables in the store so I assume people usually take out. The price is fine and for sure I will try it again."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE! Seriously, I'm in love win their chicken. At first I was a little skeptic b ecause I've never paid $10 for a piece of chicken but honestly, worth every penny  I recommend getting the original fried chicken, medium hot (if you can handle the heat, but I don't think it's to spicy). The chicken was so crispy and juicy and every order is made FRESH. you can really taste it when you bite into it.   Personally, it is pretty heavy on the stomach so I recommend this as a snack between two people if your craving something hearty. They also do combos if your looking for a chicken item + drink.   4 stars because the mojito drink wasn't great. It was so plain and just tasted like carbonated soda with nothing else.   I'm coming back to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I read up on yelp before visiting so I was prepared to wait a bit for the chicken. The wait actually wasn't that long, maybe 15 min? It's freshly fried so the large fried chicken came out piping hot. The seasoning (original) is very similar to Taiwanese salt and pepper chicken with a bit spiciness to it. All this is to say....it was freaking BOMB. My friend and I shared one (only because we were planning to eat somewhere after too, but I could have definitely finished one whole one). I don't really see why people have issues with the fact that there's a bone in the chicken...the wall has a picture of the \"anatomy\" of the fried chicken and it clearly indicates that there is a bone at the bottom. Plus, that's what makes this chicken unique--each section is supposed to taste somewhat different. Isn't that better than a homogenous chicken nugget type thing??   Anyway...the chicken is piping hot, juicy beyond words, and perfect seasoning. Takes me back to Taiwanese night market chicken."}
{"text":"Small place with only 10 seats. Cashier is nice, the service is average and place is really clean. The Large Fried Chicken with cheese is filled with love until you get to the bottom half where it's just bones.. On the bright side it's not your typical chicken dumped in oil. It will definitely fill you up. Chicken is soft and fresh. The popcorn chicken is pretty good. You have the option of getting it with salt & pepper or spicy. I got about 10-12 pcs. They only offer ketchup as the sauce. My suggestion is to offer a variety of sauces. Spicy mayo would be a lovely pair. Good luck trying to find parking. We were lucky to park literally in front of the place. Street parking is free after 10pm on weekdays!"}
{"text":"3.5 star. Probably one of my favourite places for fried chicken. It's quite expensive at first if you haven't tried it... but that piece of original XXL chicken breast ($10) coated with pepper salt is to die for.  its very crispy on the outside but the meat is super tender, juicy and moist. You can definitely taste the chicken and not frozen meat. The seasoning is just the right amount and not over done to the point where it's super salty.  You usually have to wait around 5-10 minutes for your chicken even if there's no line because they dip the chicken into the batter and fry it for you on the spot so it's hot and fresh. Probably my go to place at pacific mall if i'm craving for some junk food."}
{"text":"Taiwanese large fried chicken franchise just recently opened at Yonge/Finch! This small, primarily takeout joint (with a few seats) serves primarily their 'famous' large friend chicken--similar to a schnitzel, but completely different in flavour. It's a bit sweet like typical Taiwanese fried chicken and it's got a thick crispy coating. The staff will tell you that it takes about 10 minutes to make the large fried chicken. You can call ahead and pick it up so you can save time.   The chicken piece is quite large but beware of the bones...reviews here are accurate--one third of the large fried chicken breast is bone, but the piece of chicken is quite large and the batter/coating is quite thick that you would feel satiated.  The batter is crispy and they cook it fresh to order as it advertises; however, the batter, IMO is a bit too thick and glutinous. You can get different toppings, such as BBQ, and various levels of spice powders.  It's $9.99 for the large fried chicken.   They have other menu items such as fried oyster (never tried), popcorn chicken (not worth the quantity), and sweet mocktail drinks."}
{"text":"The serving size of their regular chicken menu is more than filling. They're nicely flavoured too. I think the cheese filled version is over priced tho considering the serving size is smaller and actually only a third of it is filled with cheese. I never risk with the appetizers too cuz they look a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is the living embodiment of a failed franchise store that is so far from the original brand, you KNOW they aren't remotely trying. (If you've had any of the original ones in Asia, you feel me) White meat chicken cutlet that is the size of a persons face done in Taiwanese seasoning, sounds awesome...how can you muck this up?  First, chicken is thin and not particularly juicy. It wasn't extremely dry, but you can definitely tell it's white meat at first bite. The batter completely came off of the meat on both sides and you are left with this part crunchy, part soggy hot mess. Flavouring was lacking so it tasted bland compared to traditional Taiwanese popcorn chicken. Another thing I found so odd is their lack of boneless option (if there was, this was not clearly advertised). Every time I had it in Asia, it either came boneless or had a boneless option. This location served up boney parts that made up 1/3 of the actual chicken. It was hard to eat and took out any leftover satisfaction you got out of it. And the price, damn it was expensive for something this underwhelming..."}
{"text":"Hot Star Large Fried Chicken prides itself on serving you big ass pieces of Taiwanese style large fried chicken and refuses to cut them for you or give you utensils!  Heard a lot about this Taiwanese franchise and noticed this location open up at Pacific Mall and gave it a try.  They had several choices but ended up just getting the original chicken in extra spicy.   To be honest the piece is freaking huge!  Many chickens must have sacrificed there lives for our enjoyment here!  Made to order, its a whole chicken breast lightly battered, deep fried and then sprinkled with chili powder mix.  Its basically like some one was making Taiwanese popcorn chicken but was too lazy to cut it up and decided to fry it whole.  The chicken itself was very tender and the outside was crisp but I found the middle to be a little too oily for me and couldn't finish it after awhile.  The chicken comes straight out of the fryer so let it cool a bit.  The extra spicy wasn't really that spicy for me but then again I'm a serious chili head so my taste buds are pretty numb to heat.  At $9.99 plus tax its on the high side but considering the size its actually reasonable.   Overall it's okay but I don't see myself ordering this often.  Hot Star Large Fried Chicken, I give you 2.5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Indeed a very large piece of fried chicken, but 1/3 of it were bones...the taste is average as in not really much flavour...it is more of a try once for the wow look at the size of this thing place..."}
{"text":"I only give this place a two star.    I ordered the large fried chicken with a little spicy.  The chicken costed ($9.99) before taxes.   The wait for the chicken was about 10 minutes or more because it was freshly fried.   I have to say, the price of chicken is huge. But when I bit into it, the meat was really thin, like extremely thin and most of it was dough. This was a little disappointing. As I ate further into the chicken. I ended up eating some bone... it was stated that the chicken is supposed to be chicken breast. I didn't expect bone to be in it.   Overall comments: probably will not purchase again. It's difficult to eat because it's such a big piece. Next time I might try the chicken bites instead."}
{"text":"Cheese stuffed chicken tastes really good. It takes 15-20 minutes to make. They do warn you when ordering. The batter for it is different from their original chicken. It's a harder shell, much crunchier. It's very oily however. The chicken itself is much juicier. The cheese is only in the one half because the other half, like their original, is bone. The spice is good."}
{"text":"Chicken was hot and fresh and the size of a persons face.  Definitely easier to eat than the chicken pieces at like Popeyes for example because its boneless and easy to handle while walking around.  A great treat for yourself when you want some protein goodness."}
{"text":"Staff here got hired to stand around, wear the uniform and sadly misinformed about customer service etiquette and trained to address complaints in the poorest form of a monotonous tone whispering \"whatever\" under their breath.  Chicken was burnt and had tiny bone pieces that I can probably let slide but after a few more pieces getting stuck in between and no possible remorse from these young workers when informed iced the cake with bitterness and a drum roll finale of \"why choose the most non asian place at Pacific Mall anyways??!!!\" It said the best in Taiwan!!!!!   Maybe it was an off day, but even the fries were cold and soggy I wanted to literally head to the nearest grocery store, chop and fry and then showcase the real expectation of fries!!!!!!! What can go wrong with frying fries??!   So lesson learned, adventurous eats within asia central should be limited to asian eats, unless approved by others to be exceptionally outstanding, then and only should I stray."}
{"text":"Meh !!! Ordered their spicy chicken, fried king mushroom, and a drink. Sadly the best part was the drink. The chicken/batter was very bland and the mushroom was very greasy. Their concept is new but they can do much better with taste."}
{"text":"This is the place for authentic Taiwanese style large fried chicken! I've visited Hot Star frequently ever since they first opened their downtown Toronto location and now their Finch location. It is my go-to spot to satisfy my fried chicken cravings. There's other newer Taiwanese chicken places that have opened since then that I've tried, like Monga, but in my opinion Hot Star is still superior.   I think they've got fried chicken down  to a science, not just the science of tasting good, but also eating enjoyment. Here's why:  - Each piece of chicken is huge, bigger than my hand. They've flattened the meat so it looks like a chicken steak, and this increases surface area for breading and thus the seasoning too. This is far better than thicker fried chicken pieces where the meat inside is not seasoned and tasteless - Interestingly all of Hot Star's chicken has a  few pieces of chicken bone left at about the bottom third of  the meat. And they seem to always serve/bag the chicken in sich a way that the bones are  towards the bottom 1/3. Some have commented how the small bones towards the bottom of each piece of chicken makes it less enjoyable. I think it actually enhances my eating experience. Starting from the top of this chicken steak you can take large satisfying bites into the chicken, and and the small bones towards 2/3 point forces you to slow down and pick out the bones. The bones are fun to pick out in my opinion, not too small as to make the experience frustrating but just enough for me to enjoying picking the meat off and licking my fingers like a little kid. Then toward the very end, the chicken is boneless again and I can finish my fried chicken with a few more bites of easy satisfaction. Hot Star's chicken have created the perfect fried chicken for me, changing my pace of eating and making my eating experience dynamically enjoyable.  Maybe I'm the only one that appreciates their fried chicken to this degree, but I definitely think they left the bone in their chicken for a reason.   I've tried all of the flavors of their original chicken, as well as the BBQ version, and cheese stuffed version. The original salt and pepper, and spicy flavors are the best, so try them based on your level of spicy tolerance. The seaweed, plum, and curry flavors are interesting but they don't give off as much of a strong taste as I've expected. They're just powdered flavoring that gets shaken with the fried chicken right before serving, so the taste has always been artificial to me. The plum flavor is especially weird, the sweetness doesn't really work with their chicken in my opinion.   BBQ fried chicken is average, as the hard shell of this particular batter tends to come off of the chicken during eating so you end up eating the batter and the pale piece of chicken separately. I have never bought it again after trying it the first time.   Cheese stuffed fried chicken is recent and I did enjoy it. Not much to say. Anything cheese stuffed deserves at least a try!  Drinks wise their Blue Curacao Yogurt drink is definitely very refreshing and unique. Highly recommend. Brings me back to my childhood in China.  If you have never tried Hot Star's fried chicken yet you definitely should! If you have before and you found my theory of eating dynamics with their chicken interesting (or weird), try their chicken again and see if you agree with me!"}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken! They make it fresh to order so a little patient is required! So happy they opened one uptown! Can choose level of spicy or even other flavours! Delicious!! Hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Portion sizes here are smaller than the downtown and pacific mall location.   I always get the large fried chicken with curry seasoning, blue curaçao yogurt drink, and fried oyster mushrooms. The total for the meal is around $20, but you'll be stuffed.  The large fried chicken tastes like your typical Taiwanese fried chicken, except as a huge large piece. Additionally, if you're going to get it with seasoning, I recommend asking for extra. It's hard to taste the curry powder flavour if you don't pack it on.  The blue curaçao yogurt drink is my favourite yogurt drink - can't go wrong with this order! Always ask for less ice.  The fried oyster mushrooms taste amazing, but the price for the portion size turns me off too much. It's $4.99 for approximately 10 small pieces. That comes up to nearly 50 cents + tax per piece.   Overall, it's an expensive meal and I'll only come here if I get the urge to take my food home and gorge on some fried chicken."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week. Seemed like Costco French fries. Chicken was just ok. Nothing special. 2 chicken orders 2 fries 2 drinks $38. Very mediocre, service wasn't very friendly and to be honest my son and I had upset stomachs for 2 days. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Not really a fan. I mean it's not bad, but for the price, I could get a box of pop eyes, which would be delicious and feed 2-3 people. Still would like to try the one with cheese, though, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe this location doesn't offer that"}
{"text":"Original XXL Fried Chicken Breast Medium Spicy ($9.99) was pretty good! Quite sizable and great to share with a friend if you choose to. The meat was surprisingly moist and juicy even though I usually prefer dark meat!  We were there on a Friday afternoon and there was no line. The wait was around 10-15 minute for the food to be ready as it does takes that long for the chicken to be cooked probably!  Will I be back? Not a bad value if you want some good fried chicken!  Funny thing is I have been to Taipei Night Market a few times but never bother ordering one (half the price over there) since there are so many other more interesting food to eat there instead of a mega piece of friend chicken that just way too filling!"}
{"text":"I first tried this joint at a media tasting and out of all the Taiwanese large fried chicken places I've tried this one is my favourite! I've tried the original, seaweed, spicy, and curry chickens. I've also tried the deep fried king mushroom appetizer (yum). For drinks, I tried the blue curaçao yogurt, green apple yogurt, and lime mojito. The lime mojito is a winner. The yogurt drinks were also really good but is too sweet.  The curry, seaweed, and spicy chickens were all really tasty and savoury and you really can't go wrong with choosing any of them.   My only complaint is that it doesn't come with rice!! This meal would be soooo much better as a dish served with rice so that it can balance out the savoury-ness and saltiness of the chicken."}
{"text":"I had their cheese stuffed fried chicken. And let me tell you, it tastes good. That's the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars.. good food.  The seating area wasn't super clean. On October the 11th, when I went, they said they were hiring, so it's likely they're simply understaffed.  The main issues I had was the wait, cost, and portion. Their cheese stuffed chicken is 11.99 plus tax, so 15 really. It's a 20 minute wait for it. When it comes to you, it looks big, but it's a regular sized breast with maybe an ounce and a half of cheese, with the breast and backbones included. It really was meagre at best, for a long wait and high price.  With a side, it would be more valuable."}
{"text":"Wow!  Hot fried chicken done in popcorn style or a huge piece of chicken looking more like a schnitzel.  They have a few different flavours but we always order the spicy one.  Spicy can also be medium it sure hot!  It's deep fried so it's also super crispy.  I just love the idea of eating the chicken like a pretzel.  You can order the chicken with a combo with their signature drinks as well.  No bubble tea though, sad to say.  Bbt goes well with anything!  Haha  Each piece of XXL chicken is typically around $10.  With combo depending if you want fries with it, then around $15.    The popcorn chicken is also spiced well and very crunchy.  You can also ask for their special hot sauce to go with it.    You do have to allow for a wait time of at least 15-20 mins.  That's the only downside.  There is also no parking on the roadside, mainly street parking but is always full so good to go with someone where one of you can hop out and order and grab the chicken.  We are now nuts over this fried chicken and always stop by whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm from Taiwan so typically is very picky on Taiwanese snacks. This fried chicken taste just like back home! (Those ones that you can get from night market), perfect for night cravings"}
{"text":"Wow it is a large piece of chicken. Tasty too! Good thing because it's a bit more expensive than what you might be used to.   Location: Hop skip and jump south of Finch Station   Parking: Didn't you read it's a hop skip And jump from Finch Station-you don't need to drive. Fine. There's street parking. It's free on Sunday morning until 1 pm afterwards it's Green P prices.   Decor: There's a lot of little shops in this strip of Yonge street. It's the blue facade.  Inside it's brand spanking new and shiny. There are a couple of tables and some barstool seating. It seems like most people grab and go. I stayed both times.  Food: the chicken is huge. I liked how it tasted. Ive tried the salt and pepper regular and crispy. Both were great choices  I also tried the sweet potato fries. Plum flavoured. I could have eaten a platter of them. They were good, so good.    I liked it here.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I came early and it didn't take too long. Juicy and tasty but it did have bones in it so that was a bit of a pain. We put ours on an order of ball waffles and made our own chicken and waffles and it was super yummy. The sweet potatoes were interesting, not in a bad way. Sweet and savoury in a unique way."}
