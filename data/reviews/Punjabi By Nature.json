{"text":"The worst place to go. The ladies behind the counter don't speak a word of English. They are dirty and the owner Rupinder  prefers serving only the men and ignores female customers. I was appalled at how she was flirting with the men in the restaurant. I purposely asked her name just so I can write this. I asked her 2 times for my order and I was told to wait while she was chatting with a guy. The food is not worth the embarrassment . Go to Brars !"}
{"text":"I found the food ok compared to other Indian restaurants in Brampton. The service is not great; I found the servers very slow and lazy even though there wasnt alot of people to serve the 3+ times Ive been there. The location on Gore Rd and Ebenezar is much better however."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a very reasonable price. Cannot complain!   The servers are extremely polite. Two people come to my mind every time my family and I visit, both young servers who go out of their way to ensure we're happy.  The only downfall are the ladies behind the counters, I understand it's busy but boy oh boy, it can be slow at times, especially when people (customers) decide their order is more important than everyone else's and become Godzillas thanks to the long wait times."}
{"text":"Good food at great price. have visited this place twice and would love it visit again with my family. The quality of food is good and loved their service too.. Will surely like to recommend this place to friends and everyone."}
{"text":"Being a foodie and a fanatic at that this restaurant deserves A++ as the young staff is visibly trying their best. Food and service is always great."}
{"text":"We catered their food for our sons birthday party and everyone really enjoyed from their appetizers to the dinner items.  My personal favourite was the jumbo shrimp that was grilled and made in their tandoor.  It's was an off menu item but a definite party favourite!! Compliments to the chef!!"}
{"text":"Delicious sweets! I've yet to try the food but I'll definitely have to go back when I'm in Brampton next!"}
{"text":"We opted for takeout, as it was really busy. We ordered samosas, naan and mixed vegetables. Was a bit confusing about where to order, but there's ample friendly staff to help. We didn't wait longer than 10 min. for our food. Was delicious! Samosas were not too spicy, naans were soft and mix vegetables were excellent:) want to try their chaat station next time!"}
{"text":"Food is yummy and staff is good too, a bit slow but well behaved. We really loved Amritsari Kulcha. Tikki chaat is ok. In Veg thali we liked Matar Mushroom curry a lot."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family on a Wednesday night. It was fairly busy despite the fact that it was a weekday! This place is definitely a family favorite of ours due to its laid back and casual atmosphere. It has a decent amount of seating and you usually don't have to wait too long for a place to sit.  We ordered 3 thalis - 3 curries, 1 raita, rice, and a dessert item. The thali comes with 1 Naan or 2 rotis. I personally enjoy the Naan better. The food was delicious and the Naan was decent enough. My thali included Shahi Paneer, khadhi Paneer, saag, and gulab jamun. I liked how the food was full of flavor but not excessively oily.  One area of improvement that I can suggest is that the wait staff make less mistakes with the order. We had to wait close to 20 minutes because they didn't get our order for the roti correctly and we had to wait for a long time. Additionally, they consistently forgot a thing or two from our order and had to go back to get it. They were very nice but not very good unfortunately.  Additionally, the restrooms need to be cleaned better - they don't smell too great.  Overall - would return because the food is just that good."}
{"text":"This location is very close to my place. I have gone there 3-4 times. Indian sweets and samosas are really delicious. I think they also have buffet, will try it soon, as whenever you enter this location, it smells so good. Sometimes when it's busy, lines are long and can take time to order, but staff is friendly. Overall a good family restaurant."}
{"text":"I found out about this restaurant at a family wedding. They had provided appetizers as well as dinner. After trying the food, we were amazed on how delicious the food was. We have been continuously using this restaurant for all of our family functions.   I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"4 star for food and 1 star for service. The people at the front have a very low knowledge about customer service. The quality of the food isn't bad at all and pretty authentic as well, but the way they deal with the customers take all the zeal away. Very average experience"}
{"text":"As a business traveler, I never know what I'll find when I get to a city. Punjabi By Nature really hit it out of the park. The dining room was clean, the staff super friendly, and accommodating, and the food was excellent.  I started with the Chana Samosa, and could had made an evening out of just that. But then, my chicken biryani and cucumber raita arrived.  I love biryani with raita, and have enjoyed it all over the world, including in Banglaru: this was top flight cooking. Craving a great Indian meal? Do yourself a favor and visit."}
{"text":"The food is good. Its the service which is a big letdown. The servers and people behind counter does not know how to interact with customers. Sometimes a blank reaction, sometimes rude. It is the food for which i give 3 stars otherwise customer service alone does not deserve any star."}
{"text":"Should I listen to yelp? Yes Should I listen to reviews? Yes  Ordered first and then stood waiting for 25 mins for a goat biryani.  No warning it was going to be that long of a wait. I would have ordered a curry if I knew it was going to be that long.   Was on the way to visit my uncle at the hospital and just \"jumped\" in to get a meal.   To give them credit the biryani was brought out 30 seconds after I asked why I wasn't told it was going to be so long of a wait.   The biryani was delicious and the yogurt was great, which is expected since it's a thali place!  My uncle and I had our dinner and I still have a full take out container!   So for the food it's 3 stars but for service it's a 1 star! If you have time then go in and enjoy cheap good food but if you're in a hurry skip it and go to another place in that area!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best indian buffet places in the GTA. Very good food, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike. The saag, butter chicken, chana, aloo gobi are all very delicious. The naan is always freshly prepared. If your not a fan of the buffet you still have additional options like the naan plate or kulcha. A must try if you like indian food."}
{"text":"I really do like the food however, the service is awful. If you do not speak the language spoken behind the counter you will generally not be served in order of arrival. (Based on three experiences) Secondly, the location is not entirely \"clean\" the floors and counter tops are filthy every time we have visited.   The price is very fair and the naan bread is fantastic but I really wish you didn't feel so stigmatized trying to order your food.   The food does sit out for a very long time and the pastry that comes with the thali is simply disgusting.  Owner seems very friendly and tries to build conversation but the women is simply rude and will not even bother asking you what you would prefer.   You know that seen in most children movies with the lunch lady who serves awful food in slow motion..... Something similar to that."}
{"text":"The restaurant isn't very fancy but the food is delicious. We tried malai kofta, kadhai paneer, naan and rabri faluda. The curries were flavourful and rabri faluda was one of the best we have had in GTA. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food but service is a little slow especially during the busy hours"}
{"text":"I came here for take-out and seeing the variety of curries set out on the steam table gave me hope that I would be out of there in 15 minutes tops. 15 minutes in I was still waiting to be served with only one person in front me of in line when I walked in. The servers were working in slow motion, even scooping rice into a container seem like a chore. I felt like all the customers that were walking in were an annoyance to the servers. I don't expect much service whenever I got to an Asian restaurant. I've been to Chinese restaurants where you have to send up flares to get any attention, but still I felt more welcome than I did here. The food was decent, but with not even a hint of a smile or any kind of efficiency I won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Good place Taste is awesome Always crowded Price is decent Servers are really nice people, but the people who actually food in the buffet counter are not friendly at all."}
{"text":"A very spacious restaurant with an elaborate culinary selection both in print and as part of the buffet. The indian bread was very soft and chewy and a great supplement to the dish selection; Finger-licking good. Service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"This fast-food/ takeout joint was just what I expected; A quicke mart for Indian food; Be it a tray, or thali, of Indian curries or spicy tandoori chicken and roti; The latter being my chosen entree, a dry,  boring and unspicy rendition of tandoori chicken; Not enough \"masaala\" for my taste buds! Otherwise, service was good but the food was not that fresh and a little re-heated."}
{"text":"Best indian buffet restaurant from all the ones that I have tried till date. Pani Puri here is to die for. They have good enough options to eat from starters to deserts. Best things first pani Puri and papadi chat are really good to start with. They also have soup but will not waste much time on that as we have many more interesting things to try. They have samosas, paneer pakoda, khacori and many more to relish on. In veggies paneer one is really good and they serve hot roti with it. Dal makhani is really good too. In deserts is hot gulabh jamun which is yummy( don't miss out) and gajar halwa with six to sever flavours of ice creams. Hope after reading this your stomach is full."}
{"text":"Punjabi by Nature has great, delicious food! The spices are just right and the food is not overly spicy or bland.   With that being said, I have problems with the service at this location. The staff is just so slow, lazy and rude. So they lose one star there.   The food temperature is warm and that's where they lose the second star. How can you serve food that's not hot in a buffet?! When I pointed it out, the server didn't even care.   Quicker service, respect for customers and hot food would make this a 5 star place."}
{"text":"I had the veg thali. The food was very flavourful but it was cold. I would expect to have hot food but wasn't really happy with it. I like the gajrela but it was also cold. The food would taste amazing if it was hot!"}
