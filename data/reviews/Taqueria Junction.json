{"text":"The worst Mexican food I have eaten. Tasted like frozen enchiladas,over cooked and dry.  We were a party of 5 and will never go again!  Charging for salsa and chips that are served in a paper bag is unacceptable.  Plastic  yellow imitation cheese.  As new residents of Olmsted falls I was so disappointed.  Only thing halfway worth eating was the burger."}
{"text":"Dios Mio, I have a problem.  I have an addiction to Mexican food.  I was so excited to try this place.  The location is really great, such a cute little area.  When I read that you have to pay for chips and salsa at first I was a little put off.  BUT then I ordered the salsa and guacamole.  The guac was so good I almost screamed when I tasted it.  Ohh. Emm. God, I would pay $5 for a little bowl of this green goodness.  I ordered the California burrito with chicken.  I like the set up of the menu because you can pick your vessel and then choose whatever you want to fill it with.  The burrito was big enough to feed a family of four and it was literally bursting with meat.  I also tried the queso dip and the Cuban sliders.  Margaritas are great, they have $3 sangria on Thursdays, and the tequila selection is HUGE.  This place is my new favorite, I want to move in upstairs."}
{"text":"Barbacoa tacos and Margaritas were incredible!!! If you leave without getting the caramel apple empanadas for desert that would be an error in judgement. We had a larger group, but the service was definitely attentive even though it was dinner rush."}
{"text":"After being a regular, weekly customer here since they opened a year ago, the TERRIBLE experience from last weekend convinced us to NEVER RETURN.  Sad thing is that it was the manager who ruined the night (tall guy with balding head, he wouldn't even tell us his name).  The servers were doing an excellent job on a very busy weekend night.  Unfortunately the manager had a rude, negative attitude that ruined everything.   When I privately spoke to him on the side and said he was being rather rude to our group it was like a light switch flipped and so did he!  He immediately said we were \"done for the evening\", had to leave immediately and never come back.  He removed drinks that we had just been served then threatened multiple times to call the police.  We tried to reason with him to get him to calm down. We told him we were regulars who came in every week and everyone had always been so nice.  He didn't want to hear it.  All of this over privately pointing out that he was being rude to customers. We are all professionals in our 40's and 50's and out for a night with friends.  We will NEVER return.  The servers told us privately that this manager always has a rude approach to them and the customers.  There are too many other places to enjoy ourselves without the need to be threatened.  And we strongly suggest that you consider other options for your night out too."}
{"text":"Had the queso and salsa for my appetizer. The chips tasted fresh, and the queso was delicious, just enough of a spicy kick. Salsa came in a plastic take-out container, which I wasn't a fan of, because it was hard to get the chips in there.  I had the trio with a hard chicken taco, shredded beef enchilada, and shredded beef taquito. The black beans were great too, but the rice that came on the side was a little undercooked. Everything came with a side of red and green sauce. Super spicy, so good! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best mod mex, short of momocho. Fun atmosphere, quick service. Love their guacamole."}
{"text":"TJ's in Olmsted Falls isn't the best place I've ever eaten, but don't get me wrong, the food was outstanding. Yeah, you gotta pay for the chips and salsa, but with the amount of food you get with your entree, you won't even need them. To the reviewer who complained about unfriendly service, you must have been there on an off day. Go sit and the bar and ask for Animal, and I guarantee you'll experience some of the best service you'll ever see. I had the carnitas empanadas. Three huge servings I could barely finish. All made in house, and made by guys who know what they're doing. Don't be afraid to try something new because their house made chorizo is amazing. I, personally, am a trained chef so I judge food harshly, and I was not disappointed at all. Try it. Ask for Animal."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly consistent and unfriendly service not even one single goodbye as our six party group leaves."}
{"text":"I like to give restaurants a fair shot and I really looked forward to trying this place out. Queso was Mexican cheese whiz, salsa tasted like it was from a can, guacamole was thin, grouper was fishy, and the drinks had no discernible alcohol (or effect)."}
{"text":"As usual great atmosphere and great food!! Perfect escaped on a gloomy Thursday night with rain outside. If you haven't been to Taqueria Junction you need to check it out, the chorizo empanadas or trio are great!"}
{"text":"Getting straight to the point, taqueria junction always shows up with great food and drinks. The staff is always helpful and I personally love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The first bad review I've ever given. Daughter, Dad date night. Daughter 12 years old and savvy goes to unisex restroom and the lock won't open for her to get out. She has to pound on door, and yells to get attention, no one can hear her. Customer hears and helps her get out. She is in tears and really upset.   I try the lock and and it sticks and is hard to open. Bring it to attention of head chef. He said sorry and will get some WD-40 and spray.    Go to check out and waitress says it's happened before. I asked the chef if he sprayed the lock and told him it happened before. He get cocky, raises his voice, is insolent and tells me. \"What do u want me to do shut the restaurant down?  This place is over 100 years old.  What do u want me to do\". I said a 12 year old girl came back to table in tears and u said you were going to spray it.   I told him I would not return and he said good.   Not good and totally rude and insensitive for a first time visitor. Btw I came because I saw a great food review in the paper.   The food was good and other's reviews are accurate insolence was sickening."}
{"text":"Met friends for some appetizers and drinks at 8:30pm. Sat on the front patio as it was a beautiful night. Waitress bungled our drink orders, but the patio was crowded so we let it go. At 9pm we were told it was last call. We ordered drinks and the orders were again wrong. At 9:15 the waitress started to clear our plates without asking if we were done. Five minutes later she turned off the lights and told us to drink up because the bartender wanted to go home. We shared our frustrations about the poor service. The waitress then brought the manager out who told us we were jerks and asked us to leave & never return. While we were critical of the poor service, we were polite; in return we were sworn at and berated. We will never eat here again. Recommend Matteos or the Moosehead if you are eating in Olmsted Falls."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this restaurant opened. It started out great. Food was good and reasonable. Made sure to support it for the first few years. Met friends for apps and margaritas for Summer Solstice. Live music in the adjacent parking lot, our town trying to celebrate. One would think this would also be a business oppty for a struggling restaurant.  They run this restaurant like a tax loss. The manager was so aggressive and nasty. After having mixed up orders, really bad service and horrible appetizers he,instead of coming out to apologize for a horrible dining experience, came out screaming and name calling. Name calling..a business owner in a customer service industry. He was a man out of control. This person also worked for Agave..I'm assuming the same investors looking for another tax write off.  We support our small community of Olmsted Falls. Please don't let this person or food represent our neighborhood restaurant district. Matteos is excellent, The Olde Wine Cellar will soon begin serving small plates..two business owners with class smiles and great food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! Best Mexican I ever had, thanks taqueria. 7 years running and I get why."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing!  Not much value for the price.  The chips and salsa are not complimentary which isn't the end of the world but we purchased them and they came served in plastic cups and paper bag- really??  The chips were cold, as an fyi.  The house margarita was mainly ice - I guess that is what made it so \"special\".  I ordered the fish sliders, they were very tasty.  They come with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries but unfortunately they arrived cold and the waitress didn't check back soon enough to fix that.  The rest of the table had crab sliders, fish tacos, flautas and the quesadilla.  All were about the same quality - good but not great.  We were out to celebrate a birthday and let the waitress know.  They have one dessert, apple empanadas.  Not gratis for the birthday girl (who was turning 17), as we found it later on the bill.  No candle not even happy birthday wishes when she brought it to the table.  The waitress seemed more obsessed with cleaning the fancy plastic cups up.  No manager stopped over to ask about our meal.  Save your money and try another restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally! Amazing tex-mex. Many of the Mexican options in CLE (west side) are all operated by one owner and everything is sooo bland. So, needless to say my husband and I were so happy to have loved our meal at TJ! I got the shredded braised brisket chimichanga! Yum! It was full of flavor and cheesy :) The crema drizzled on top was also delish. We got queso (perfect) and salsa for an app. Salsa was so-so, decent flavor but really liquid-y. Dessert! We shared the apple pie empanadas. They were good, awesome flavor with caramel whipped cream but I feel like the apples could have been cooked longer. I didn't try it, but my husband got the braised brisket wet burrito and he LOVED it. Lastly....I should have started with this... We had homemade (from scratch) watermelon-mint margaritas! They were outstanding. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Kind of overpriced for what it is and for the location. $9 for an \"ok\" margarita is a little bit much. And it's never acceptable for a restaurant with these prices to charge me for chips and salsa and then bring out the salsa in a plastic take-out cup. Queso and quac were good. But unfortunately due to the prices and portion sizes we saw on other customers' plates, we decided not to order entrees. Staff seemed friendly, and this is a cool concept though. Unfortunately I probably wouldn't go back. There are just better Mexican spots in the Cleveland neighborhoods for the same kind of prices (or less)."}
{"text":"For me, travel and tasty have been partners this spring/summer.   Traveled to Olmsted Falls to see Mom and she and assorted family took me to a local Ohio/mex place.   Not a combo you would necessary put together.. Olmsted Falls and Mexican, but wait a minute.. hold on mr. quick to judge, make assumption dude..It's there, it's real and it is good.  Had a late lunch on a hotter than usual day so started out with a pineapple mojito.. muddled, fruity, fresh goodness and cooled to day with the first sip.   Got some chips and salsa/queso -- very nice, ended up getting a number of orders.   Salsa is pico di gioish, queso is creamy smooth and has a nice kick.   Chips are served fresh in a bag and easily passed around.    For lunch I had a neatly fried, just crunchy chimichanga with shredded braised beef.. nice texture, excellently spiced and seasoned --  Did not see the cook, but some skill going on here, training, skill and experience..yum.     Had a great family visit, the waitress was perfect, friendly and relaxed.  The building is in historic Olmsted Falls Grand Pacific Junction.(thats a mouthful). is in the old Grangers club building and they used to have charity pancake breakfasts here.. if I recall.. This is a nice change up.. Go here.. eat well, travel if you must! Worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I only recently visited here for the first time and was extremely happy with my experience. My waitress was prompt and was nice. She answered all questions with a great attitude as well.   I ordered the Shredded Beef Chimichanga and my friend ordered the Chorizo Empanadas. YUM to both! The Crema that they served on my chimichanga was so delicious I could have licked my plate, if it was socially acceptable. I also thought the classic margarita had the perfect amount parts tequila to flavor. I will definitely be back to visit and soon!  Wednesdays they have a $3.99 Margarita Special and Thursdays they have $3.99 Sangria's"}
{"text":"I can't really provide any input on a regular dine-in experience, since we came here for a rehearsal dinner. We had a buffet-DIY-burrito-taco-salsa set up, so things were a little different, I imagine, from ordering from the menu and being served.  That said, I really liked the place. The atmosphere was great and the servers were nice and on top of things, despite the inevitable confusion and chaos that comes with a group larger than 10. The salsa and guacamole were both fantastic. If you know anything about me, I judge Mex establishments on their salsa and Taqueria Junction definitely passed. The chips were also pretty good and came in cute little lunch-bag-like pouches for the table. The buffet food we had was also really good. It was less greasy and processed than most Mexican restaurants, which means a lot. I stuffed myself silly and wasn't even THAT mad about it!   I have sworn off tequila for a NYResolution, so I didn't get the \"tequila bar\" experience, though there was nothing wrong with my draft! Overall, this place is great, but the likelihood of coming back soon is pretty low since it's a bit out of the way."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Staff is kind and responsive.   Great menu selection and the drink menu is large!!  Food came out in about ten minutes.   I had the Mexican burger and fries.  Outstanding!! Fries are not homemade only disappointment; nonetheless they were seasoned well and tasted good.  Just wish they were fresh cut not frozen.   The empanadas were tasty and filling also.   It would be nice if you could substitute sides for example rice to fries but you can not. NO SUBSTITUTIONS.   I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Ate on a Saturday night after 8 and it wasn't crowded. The guacamole was very good; some of the best I have had in a while. I had the fish tacos and they were pretty good but nothing to get excited about. My wife had the trio and said the same. Didn't try the tequila this visit but will on the next. The server was Katie and she was very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love, love!  I'm so happy that \"Agave\" is back in action as the newly revamped Taqueria Junction.  The menu has shrunk - but the food quality has improved a LOT! On this trip we ordered the Chips, Salsa, Queso, and Guacamole as an appetizer (the chips come in a cute little white bag labeled \"munchies\" - we were amused), to eat we ordered a Chicken Quesadilla (chicken, pico, black beans, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream), Carnitas Enchiladas (corn tortillas, carnitas, melted cheese, green mole sauce), and Shredded Beef Enchiladas (corn tortillas, shredded beef, melted cheese, green mole sauce). Everything was delicious.  Taqueria Junction seems to be marketed more as a restaurant than a bar and garners a little bit of an older scene than its Crocker Park predecessor. That isn't a bad thing. The alcohol is still there and my personal fave - the mojitos - are definitely still on the menu. Not to mention the place is technically a TEQUILA bar - there is no shortage of choices when it comes to the Mexican spirit. Plus, there's nothing like starting the night off right with a shot of Patron.  If you were a fan of the old Agave you'll be happy to see familiar faces behind the bar. If you're new to this \"Modern Mexican and Tequila Bar\" - you are likely to fall in love.  As far as the interior goes it's a weird mix of country meets Mexican but comes across as somewhat chic and trendy. There is limited outdoor seating (about six tables maybe) and the inside seats about 73 (or so I was told). Parking is limited (there is a small lot in the back) but we parked by the Drug Mart across the street.  TJ could have gotten a 5 star rating from me - but would-be patrons be warned - their air conditioning is basically nonexistent. They're aware of the problem and fingers crossed it will soon be remedied.  My last suggestion for TJ - please get some t-shirts made! I'd love to purchase one."}
{"text":"cute, good service, nice patio, bring lots of money"}
{"text":"When it comes to Mexican food, you can't beat this place anywhere in or near Cleveland. Everything tastes and feels fresher than even homemade meals, and the textures and flavor pairings are spot on.   Even their hot sauces are bursting with flavors instead of just tasting like hot. You'll keep eating after you feel full but you won't feel like you need a nap. Good daily specials, too!"}
{"text":"Okay, I know it's probably a Yelp staple to say this, but I really WANTED to like this place. I live in the same city, and my family loves Mexican, from high end stuff like Momocho all the way down to the occasional Chipotle or Moe's. We visited TJ about 2 years ago, and all I recall was that the kids were \"ehh\" and my partner and I were sort of neutral. So I decided it deserved another chance.  I took my 2 sons and we were all extremely disappointed. I found the menu to be quite overpriced (I paid $49 before tip--crazy, given what we had.) We were the only people, save for one other table and a guy at the bar, at 6:30 p.m. on a Wednesday night. Should have taken that as a bad, bad sign.  My cucumber margarita was decent, but not anywhere near worth $9. No chips are served unless you pay for them. I ordered chips and guacamole. My younger son LOVES guac, as do I, but he took one bite and gave the thumbs down sign, refusing to eat any more. This guac was brownish green, and looked as if it had been sitting in the refrigerator for at least a day ... just like my homemade guac looks after a day or two. (It also came out almost immediately, which pretty much confirms that it was not made fresh.) My fish tacos were below average and mostly tasteless. The rice on my plate was stone cold. I mentioned this to our waitress and she said, \"That's odd, they're supposed to be served room temperature.\" Huh? Room temperature?  My older son had wings and ate maybe 1/3 of them. My younger son had the cheese quesadilla and ate half his order before saying that his tummy hurt. None of us enjoyed the experience at all.  I'm very bummed to write this review, as I would treasure having a more reasonably priced Mexican restaurant right down the street from us. Sigh."}
{"text":"This place was a must stop.... Started with the stuffed peppers... Good place to start... Had the chicken tacos they were super.... I'm gonna for sure be back"}
{"text":"We had a family dinner with 10 orders - all of them different with unique specifications.  Everyone in the family loved their meal - even the one Grandpa who doesn't like Mexican."}
{"text":"I live on Ohio city but I will drive here for three reasons : 1. Atmosphere. 2.  Service. 3.  The FOOD.   I'm a semi regular at this gem of a restaurant.   This is just what Olmsted falls needs. A FUN, non-chain, laid back but energetic spot to get together and have a great time. The atmosphere is welcoming and bright.   The service is dynamite. All of the servers are fantastic and accommodating. There's never an empty glass or a wait for what you need. They're fast, friendly and treat you like you're royalty. .   At this point I think I've tried everything on the menu, and the me I never disappoints.  The food is fresh. With a special kind of care that goes into every plate that you can see &  you can taste.    LOVE THIS PLACE. bravo Katie Ellis (owner)."}
{"text":"We live in Olmsted Falls and have been here several times hoping it will get better but never does!  The waitresses we've had are rude and the food is mediocre at best!  The last time we were there our food came to the table so fast we didn't understand how they even had time to prepare it!  Well, after one bite we understood!  The burritos had meat that was hard and overcooked probably from days ago inside of them!  I think they literally pulled them out of the refrigerator and microwave them and brought them to our table!  To top it all off the waitress was rude and unapologetic like a previous waitress we had had there!  We like to eat at local businesses however this one we won't be going back to!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for dinner on a slow weekday night.  The two gentlemen behind the bar were super friendly and gave us a great recommendation.   We wanted something to split and were told to try the wet burrito with half green sauce and half red.  We ordered it with the shredded chicken.  Amazing!  So delicious!  The chips and guac were pretty tasty too. They also had a good selection of IPAs for those into that, such as my friend."}
{"text":"Went to Taqueria Junction last night with some friends and everything was great.  I was a little worried after reading several bad reviews, however I thought the place was great.  The staff was awesome, they were very friendly and attentive, the $3 margaritas were almost too good and everyone really liked their meals as well.  A lot of the comments I saw were people complaining about the chips that come in a bag - why I don't know because it was no big deal at all and such a silly thing to complain about - a bag or a bowl what's the difference?    Really liked the place and will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Went on Monday for fajita night.  Guacamole was awesome, but fajitas were just ok.  We had good service and enjoyed walking around Grand Pacific Junction afterward."}
{"text":"Food is good but very over priced. $12.99 for 3 tacos. Very small scoop of rice and beans come with it. There is an extra charge for chips and salsa!! Reminded me very much of Chipotle but twice the price. I'll go to Chipotle and save some money."}
{"text":"Long story short :  this place is formally known as Agave which was located in Crocker Park. I was so sad when they left Crocker, and grieved their loss and the loss of my sweet, sweet burrito mojado for years until I found out that the place relocated and switched names...kinda like the theory of Elvis faking his death, only this was for real.   Anyway, I got the wet burrito with vegetables and mole sauce and enjoyed it all over again.   Dad got fajitas and enjoyed them as well.   The margarita list is extensive, featuring various different flavors and $3.99 house margaritas on wednesday.  Overall simply good, healthy, fresh food."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years. We order the same thing every time. The new owner says it now takes too long to make the item, but make it for us this time. The menu states there is a $1 up charge for the order, but upon placing the order with the server, the owner came to the table and stated it would now be a $2 charge for the same exact item we have been ordering from day one. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always have good food, made fresh. Great margaritas (try the cucumber) and good service. It gets super busy, and the place is small. Need to go early. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered a happy hour margarita for $3.99 It had little to no tequila in it , ordered another and asked to have a shot of bottom shelf tequila added. A small shot was added.  When a got the bill there was a $9.00 charge for the bottom shelf tequila so my happy hour drink was $12.99 and it still had a small amount of tequila!  Extremely over priced for what you get.  Same for the food."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant first visit here this Friday evening. We were immediately welcomed as we walked into the patio by a very friendly gentleman. He sat us at the corner table by the window with a nice view of the patio for people watching. Our waitress was very friendly (Lyndsey, I think). She provided quick and very welcoming service throughout our visit. The food was ok. We had the salsa and queso appetizer. The queso had a film on top, as if it had been sitting for a while. The salsa seemed fresh and had a kick to it, which we liked! I had the wet burrito which was pretty good. My husband had steak tacos which he really enjoyed. I had a cucumber margarita....this was the best part of my dinner. So good-fresh, light and very refreshing. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been to TJ many many times. We live close and it's a frequent Friday night spot. Recent changes in staffing have caused us to stop going.  First off the owner/manager, no matter how many times we have been there has been consistently rude and off putting. I have never liked the fact that they charge for chips and salsa and on their high end tequila's ($45 per shot and up) you get a strict 1 oz. measured pour. Our last straw came with the new bartender. He could not pour a beer, slopped it on the glasses each time AND wiped the rims off with his fingers!! Utterly disgusting. We will never go back. Two stars because we enjoyed the food though completely overpriced."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, this place is a hidden gem with delicious Mexican food.  Taco Tuesday is a great deal, but it is the guacamole that brings me back.  Simply amazing!  The wait staff is friendly, attentive, and not intrusive."}
{"text":"Huge portion and prices were comparable. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. It came with black beans and rice that were ok. Definitely try their green sauce and their habanero sauce both are spicy but the habanero is really spicy!  The queso, guacamole and salsa trio app is worth it to share for the table. Also tried the berry mojito- not sweet but still made with fresh ingredients.  Friends ordered the Cali burrito- it's massive. If I'm ever in the neighborhood I will probably get that since it comes with guacamole and other goodness."}
{"text":"Taqueria Junction is a hidden gem for those who love to taste great Tequila.  Their expansive menu is impressive however what more impressive is the quality of Tequila they offer. The Gold, Silver, Anejo and Reposado type of Tequila can be had at Taqueria Junction.   The food mostly Tapas style are great accompaniments.  During my last visit I had the Patron flight - three types of Patron served 3oz. each with Sangrita, Salt, and Lime.  This is a great starter drink.  You get to try three different types of Patron - Anejo, Reposado, Silver  stronger to lighter respectively.  They were served at the perfect temperature and went down smoothly and relatively quickly.  See the picture to get a visual of these are served on a wooden plank and quite attractively I must say.  This was followed by a Patron silver.    I was in a party of 5 and we shared,  a Junction Pizza (Crispy Flour Tortilla's/ Cheese/ Pintos/ Lettuce/ Tomato/ Red Sauce/ Crema), Cuban Sliders (pulled pork, chipotle bbq, cheese, pickle, slaw, aioli, mustard, fries), and Taquitos (Crispy Corn/ Cheese/ Guacamole/ Mexican Crema/ Pico De Gallo/ Shredded Lettuce).   Each of these items tasted quite well with our drinks and the portions were larget enough that we had left overs.  I did  not find any of the items to be too oily or stale.   We arrived around 4:30 and give the clear line of sight into the kitchen,  I notices each item were prepared after we placed the order.  To be honest,  I can't think of anything I would change about these dishes as in pairing with with drinks.  I don't think I will ever go to Taqueria Junction and not have Tequila and thus, the food review to me, will be always in conjunction with the drinks.  I think Taqueria Junction has done a good job in keeping their menu limited but with items that pair well with their drink offerings.  The service quality was good,  there was nothing bad to be said but at the same time there isn't anything out of ordinary be said either.   The food came relatively quickly to our table as did the drinks.  The ambiance is cozy and open.  Given the limited space of the establishment,  I feel they have done a good job in maximizing the seating as well as the bar area.   Taqueria Junction is a must go place for after-work drinks as well as groups or casual dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give a zero star rating, I would, but the app requires a star.  The staff, including the manager/owner (tall bald man) is incredibly rude.  It is clear they do not want return business, and they will certainly never receive another penny from our family.  If you are in Olmsted Falls and are in the mood for Mexican food, for your own good I urge you to drive a couple of miles into Berea and patronize Maya.  The service and food at Maya are far superior!"}
{"text":"Other than the awkward parking, this place was a nice find. Very clean and modern feel on the inside, yet you still know you're at a Mexican restaurant. Nice patio in the front (although it looked like rain, so we ate inside). The chips and guacamole were excellent (the salsa was okay) and the muscles had a delicious garlic/cilantro sauce. For my main dinner, I had chorizo hard shell tacos. The chorizo had a nice subtle flavor to it. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm floored by the negative reviews of Taqueria Junction. I've been more or less a \"regular\" there for the better part of three years, and in the interest of full disclosure, I have become quite friendly with the owner and some of the staff.   With that said, I have always had a great time at TJ and my girlfriend and I have always enjoyed our meals, drinks and service there. The ingredients have always seemed fresh, and their mole and sauce toppings are some of the best I've found on  Cleveland's West side.   Things like charging for chips and salsa, may seem out of the norm, but at the end of the day this is an independently-owned restaurant trying to make a buck, as they should. I know from experience that what they charge for some of their high-end tequilas (I'm a bit of a conisseure) is considerably lower than many other Taquerias in and around Cleveland.   While I've never witnessed a negative encounter between the owner and a customer, I've read about many here in the reviews. I have always found the owner to treat me with a mutual respect. He cares very much for his business and the investments he's made over the years, and I respect that, in return he appreciates my patronage and rewards me with fine service and quality food and drinks."}
{"text":"If you're a tequila connoisseur, this is the place.  The place is in Olmsted Falls but you'll feel like you're in a hip bar in Tremont.    A bit on the pricey side, especially for the food, but judging from the crowd, it's going to do well."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because the food is really good but recently they took an item off the menu (barbacoa chimichanga) and sizes seem to be getting smaller but prices keep going up and up.  Great place and great atmosphere just wish they wouldn't keep upping the prices and ruining a good thing.  Charging $5-8 for chips and salsa:no thanks."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with the wifey. Ambience was good, staff was friendly and attentive and the drinks were decent.  The food served was barely average for Mexican food. I just relocated from California where great Mexican food is aplenty and doesn't cost nearly as much for what we paid here. The molé sauce was not flavorful and the fact that the restaurant doesn't serve Tapatio hot sauce (a staple for Mexican food) definitely makes me question the food choices by the management.  Hopefully another experience in the future might change my mind.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh My \"Frickin\" God! where do I begin.  First of all we got yelled at for moving two tables together on the patio. The tall, bald manager in a stern voice told us all of our margaritas would fall off the table because all of the tables are uneven. So after he threw his hissy fit we decided to eat inside in a 88 degree restaurant. The food was a step above Taco Bell but the service was good. Do NOT come here."}
{"text":"Good food, very expensive though. Unfortunately not worth the prices. My family and I had a very awkward visit due to our server and someone that seemed like a manager. Uneventful, but awkward. Might come back, but will have to watch what we order because of the extreme prices."}
{"text":"Popped in to check the place out after hearing about it.   My, my sleepy little Olmsted is vibing vibrant these days...   It appears that Taqueria is geared toward serving food and drink that is fresh and tasty.    Margarita was very good ($3.00 on Wednesdays)...did I detect fresh lime juice....guacamole and chips....don't care if the chips came in a bag or not...they were tasty...     Yes...I can picture myself on the back porch sipping chilly  Mojito this summer...."}
{"text":"If you think this is authentic Mexican, than you must think Spaghetttos is real Italian. Seriously, you're not only charged for chips and salsa, but they come in a pre-packaged bag and a little plastic cup of salsa.  There isn't a Mexican or even Texan within a10mi radius of this joint."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not all that great... the location and vibe is good, but the food is average and expensive.  Much better Mexican places not far from this one...."}
{"text":"If you want some cold, not Mexican food, come here. Everything is cold, even the meat. The tortillas aren't heated, and aren't good, the chips are cold.... I would've rather had Taco Bell. This is Ohio Mexican food at its worst. I would never come here again, avoid at all costs. Seriously below sub par food, and extremely over priced."}
{"text":"Much of what has already been written is very true. This is a tequila shop with Mexican food.  Yes, you can taste a wide variety of tequila in an antique setting (Grand Pacific Junction - Olmsted Falls).   AMBIANCE: The best feature of this place is the building, but it's also a limiting factor. You can get the feeling you're back in the late 1800's while here, but it's small seating area is not an asset. Do not go on a Friday or Saturday and expect relaxation or comfort, but on a lazy mid-week,  you will find quaint ambiance. Visually it's an appealing experience too - antique hardwood floors and decroative tequila display behind the bar are pleasing as are TV's with sports shows.  ACCESSIBILITIY: This is an old building among other old buildings so parking - is limited to 3 spots. The main entrance is in the rear and you  can walk a short distance from from an alley, or you can park in a strip mall parking lot - across a busy street and enter. There is a Front door - but it is often closed - which is confusing.  FOOD: It's Mexican food, and overpriced - probably to support the artistic display showcasing the tequila behind the bar. It's average and not worth a trip on it's own. Maya (see my other review) is more reasonably priced and better quality - just down the street.  DRINK: It's already been said - they specialize in Tequila. Yes, it's a varied selection. mostly $6.00/shot. OK.   KID FRIENDLY: NO. This is s a TEQUILA BAR - NOT Applebees. Should kids drink Tequila or know the difference between reposado and anejo? NO. No kids menus... Take your kids to Taco Bell or Friday's. This is NOT kid friendly, and should be 21/over.  WAIT STAFF: The waitresses are welcoming and prompt, although a little quiet.  SERVICE: There is no host station and no reservations. This makes it a challenge to enjoy an evening on a Saturday night - unless you enjoy over-crowding and wait-times. (makes me wonder if the mgt is experienced restaurantours  or just Agave-heads with more attitude than business sense.  OVERALL: Thumbs DOWN. There's just too many other BETTER options in the area to recommend this place.  I'm not impressed with the management - or their vision they rolled out. Good in theory but in practice they are out of place - I think this crew has visions of E.4 street or W.6th hip with without the budget to rent there.  Olmsted needs less attitude and more laid-back.  See Tony K's, Moose Head, Maya, Fat Little Buddies, Oriole Cafe, Zach's, Upper Deck to name just a few alternatives in 1mile."}
{"text":"Wow - I was really impressed by this place.  I didn't even know they existed until today but I will certainly be back now that I am in the know!  The decor is cute and as another reviewer said, you feel like you are in a hip Tremont restaurant.  The service was very good - not so quick that you feel rushed but not too slow.  My husband and I ordered the queso dip for an appetizer and it was amazing.  Very flavorful and just enough heat but not overly spicy.  I had to resist licking the bowl with a finger.   I had the chicken empanadas which were perfectly done.  I love the fact that you can choose your dish (emanadas, burrito, taco...) and then choose the filling.  My husband got the trio platter which was a burrito, taco and enchilada.  He said they were all excellent and very flavorful.   You could definitely tell that everything was freshly made.  No sauce from a can here.  Presentation of everything was very well done.  All our dishes were very attractive.  And the margarita.... YUM! I hate going to a place and getting a margarita that is made from a mix.  Once you have a \"real\" one, you never want the mix again. Real is exactly what you get here.  They are flavorful and expertly made.  I love the fact they have such a large variety of tequila here and that you can chose what tequila you want your margarita made with.  I will recommend Taqueria Junction to everyone and I will definitely be back!  As for price, I think they are reasonable.  You are getting fresh food freshly made.  Don't expect the super cheap prices of some mexican restaurants in the area because the quality of  food here is far superior to most of the local mexican restaurants in town.  The $8 and change I paid for my emanadas was well worth it.  I got three, huge emanadas for the money and I felt it was worth it.  Margaritas start at $6.95 (I believe) and they are worth it."}
{"text":"About our 3rd time here after not really having any ideas where to go.  Bottom line,  should have kept looking for another spot.  We came in the front doors and as always this place has a modern neat vibe.  It appeared at first glance that most tables had just been sat.  we opted for 2 chairs at the bar.  Not ideal but was Ok.  A apparent hostess came up to us and asked if we wanted the bar or a table.  I thought that was pretty clear as we were pulling out chairs.  However, I did ask how long it would be for a table.  With that her response was \"I really have no idea\"  Really, my reply and asked how they can have no idea as to wait times.  She was rescued by a veteran who explained that it would be about a half hour.  We stuck with the bar.  YELP TIP.....Do not start reading bad reviews upon being seated.  My wife who has a sensitive but not sophisticated palette inquired about the white wine.  The bartender Katie knew very little about wine.  And yes I get that its a mexican joint.  Upon my wife asking to try the wine she was told no sampling as it was law.  She was correct its law.  However, the manager came over and explained how they had a liquor board violation and complaint.  My wife simply agreed and asked if she did not like the wine could she return it.  THe Tall bald manager referenced in other reviews rudley said.....\"If I think your going to return it im not going to sell it to you.  At $8 dollars a glass that a bit harsh.   Really?  Now I can not return a drink if its not liked?  WOW.  We opted for the Jamaican Mussels (again I know its mexican)   Even proving to be more curious was how, when and why Curry is their secret mexican spice. They were pretty good with plenty of garlic.  However, I'm not sure they were $12 good. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos which were grilled and good sized.  However, very saucy and ratio of fish to cabbage was way off.  But I say again good sized.     I had the chicken Fajitas.  Pretty solid portion.  However, it appears that the chicken is portioned, pre cut and par cooked.  Again we encounter the secret spice, curry.  Really?  One of the yelp reviews complained that the food temp was a notch above taco bell.  I have to say this was spot on.  Both dishes were brought out luke warm.  Plates themselves were not even close to warm.  Someone needs to learn \"hot food Hot.  Cold Food Cold\"  The Fajitas also came with a dollop of quac.  Nothing special, and not sure its even made on site.  No diced tomatoes, Sour Cream or cheese.  Did I mention they cook with curry?  The best part of the dish was the habanero hot sauce.  This was not too hot and quite good.  Rice was plain white rice.  Come on guys.  Even Chipotle uses cilantro and lime.  I am shocked that they charge for chips and salsa.  Small bullet of salsa.  The fajitas as I said was a good portion.  So much so that I had enough left over for 1 more but the dish only came with 3 tortillas.  I asked the bartender for 1 more tortilla and was told that I would not be able to get just 1.  They are sold in 3's.  Really?  Im $15 into a dish that's not that good to begin with and $75 into the entire dinner.  Now I just cant get 1 more tortilla?  Shocked I plead my case that I just needed 1 more.  The Bartender told me I can just buy the 3 and through out the other 2.  Really.  So I just went old school and used the fork.  While doing so I had to ask \"Just exactly how much are 3 tortillas?  She said she was not exactly sure and thought they were $1.  Are we really fighting over $1 on a $75 check for 2 people?  Yes apparently we are.  The overall food quality and price is not in line and the poor customer service, which based on other Yelp reviews will be the demise of this place.  So long my Jamaican, Indian wanna be Mexican friends.  While you find your true Identity and nickle and time customers.  Ill be finding a new place to dine where  Im a valued guest and not an intrusion to your lack luster establishment. Bye Mon, alavida, Goodbye!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past few weeks and I generally really like this place. The food is good - a step up from most Mexican restaurants. The menu is also different with some upscale options. There are 3 things that I don't understand though: 1. Why they don't give out free chips. Come on it's a Mexican restaurant. Also, if you want more chips after you've paid for your little bag, it's an extra $1. 2. Taco Tuesdays - $5 off tacos is awesome EXCEPT  you can't get shrimp or grouper. Those are regular price plus $2. Why? 3. Rice - it seems to always be undercooked"}
{"text":"Spicy cucumber Margarita is on point! Try the Caribbean wings.  Katie is an awesome and super attentive bartender! You can't find great places like this in the burbs! Go taqueria!!!"}
{"text":"I spent my college years in Arizona and gained a fond love for authentic Taquerias - so when I saw Taqueria Junction in nearby Olmsted Falls soon after moving to Cleveland, I got really excited.  That excitement however turned to 'meh' after two visits to the joint.        The restaurant is located in a really cute main street flanked by wonderful boutiques and upscale restaurants.  Inside, Taqueria Junction has a really great relaxed yet fun vibe and the way the bar and front tables are laid out make it a great spot to grab a few drinks at.            However, my meals both times here were very average and 'just okay'. Great Mexican or TexMex food should be very flavorful with spices but the taquitos I ordered were very bland and had no spice but what threw me off more was the fact that I couldn't change out the beef in the taquitos with another meat - which indicates that they're cooked from frozen and not fresh and thus customizable. Very disappointing.  The sides I had with my main course also seemed like they were frozen - and any meal at a restaurant that's not fresh is unacceptable.  The margaritas I had here were also 'just okay' and could've tasted like they came from a pre-made mix from the grocery store...which i believe could be the case.        In a country where one can find amazing and flavorful Mexican food fit for a true fiesta, Taqueria Junction feels like a mere imitation and the chill vibe of the place isn't enough to warrant repeat visits."}
{"text":"First timers here and it was a nice Friday night happy hour pleaser.  Margs first and foremost! They had all different types of tequila to choose from and they didn't fall short of selection if you want to be picky.  We had pineapple, house, modern, and golden. The modern and pineapple were our favorites. We got the chips trio platter to start, (guacamole queso salsa). Salsa was good but average, however, the queso and guacamole were for sure flavorful and delicious. The guacamole had a nice tangy lime flavor and was very fresh. We ordered two different chimichangas (shredded chicken & braised brisket) both on point but the brisket was for sure the favorite. And holy homemade cilantro lime sour cream! They top the chimi with it but after trying a dollop, we got some on the side.  This place will be a monthly stop for us!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Olmsted Falls for 8 years and when this place opened, I was quite excited. We don't have a slew of dining options in this town, and Taqueria Junction is within walking distance. So, it was somewhere I'd patronize every so often.   Never again. At least, not while the current manager/owner is a part of this business. Like many others here, I was witness to his ridiculous aggressive demeanor toward his customers. In late June, my girl arranged for my folks, our kids, and some coworkers to meet there to celebrate my birthday. There were a dozen of us there and not many were able to relate a dining experience where we felt less welcome. Here's a quick rundown:  1. I wanted to order a side of french fries for my son. He's four and eats like he's four. The waitress was polite enough, but told me that I couldn't order just fries as they were all \"portioned out to be sold with burgers\". I understand that some food is preprepared so things can be hustled out when it's busy, but exceptions can be made with fries. They're potatoes. I asked her to make an exception for a small child and she looked pretty hesitant because, according to her, the manager gets upset when asked to make those sorts of accommodations. I asked to speak with him, but she did on my behalf. He acceded my request, but it shouldn't even have been a discussion. Restaurants shouldn't operate with that level of rigidity.   2. As I mentioned, it was my birthday and partway through the meal, my father brought in two gifts. The manager (or owner - again, I don't know his official position there) snapped at my old man; telling him that they didn't have room in the restaurant for gifts to be opened. He mentioned something about the place filling up to capacity, but the place was a bit over half-empty. We opened our gifts anyway before hustling them back out to the car. Happy birthday.   3. There is a long bench that runs along one wall of the restaurant. There was a younger couple seated next to our table who had a baby. The gal placed the baby seat on the bench between her and my mother who was sitting on the other side of the small gap between our tables. The manager told her that she couldn't put the seat there because the place was going to fill up soon. What sense does that make? She sheepishly removed the baby seat. If that was my girl he snapped at, things would have gotten nasty.   And his general demeanor was a huge turnoff. As we ate, we could hear him loudmouthing his way through his job. Listen, there is plenty of room for some general eccentricity in small businesses. Some of my favorite places to patronize have employees that don't follow the sort of strict personality model enforced by a lot of chain restaurants. But this place, while good, isn't nearly so indispensable as to be able to get away with him being such a jerk. There are plenty of other dining options in the larger area."}
{"text":"There were 6 in our party and every one of us were very pleased with our choices. The guacamole is excellent. Staff was friendly and attentive. I had the empanadas but can't wait to go back to try the fish tacos"}
