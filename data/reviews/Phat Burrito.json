{"text":"Best place to grab a bite for lunch. Gets busy around lunch time and parking can be hard to find but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I know... it's Mexican food.  I love me some Mexican.  But I was not real impressed with this place.  I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  I had the chicken tacos.  They were OK.  I liked the salsa bar.  Overall, it was an \"OK\" experience."}
{"text":"The place was a ghost town when we walked in at noon on a weekday.

Now I know why...

The food - at least the part of our orders that we actually got - was unremarkable.

The counter folks were clueless.  We tried to tell them they hadn't brought our entire order but they shrugged it off and did nothing.

We decided we didn't really want it after all, so we gave up and left.

I give this place 6 months tops.  

Then after the current tenants vacate this will make a great location for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Cool place. Got the BBQ chicken burrito. Really good and salsa bar is good too. Was disappointed that they don't make their own tortilla chips. They came out of a bag. Overall pretty good and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"It's 8:45pm on Thursday Jan 5 2017 and the doors are locked. Young man comes to the door and says they are closed. I say \"aren't you supposed to be open until 9?\"  With a smile he says yes and \"sorry bro\". Unprofessional. Hope the owner reads this."}
{"text":"Simple and unpretentious.  Good burritos and better tacos.  I'm a fan of their fish tacos with the mango salsa.  Can get really crowded at lunch."}
{"text":"Put simply... these are the only burritos my better half will eat. I can't add much to that.

It's definitely not fancy but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place has good food, no ifs ands or buts about it.  It's simple, not ellegant but the atmosphere is not lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"I have stopped here a couple of times. I really would like to give it a 4 star rating, however it is honestly a 3. The burritos are pretty good however the place could use some fixing up. The seating is not that great and the dining room is not always clean.

Their burritos are indeed Phat. To eat a whole one takes some time. The ingredients are par at best. Some times the rice is a little hard. The veggie burrito contains squash and peppers, which sounds a bit odd, but is a rather tasty addition.

Finally, I must mention the \"salsa bar\". It's more of a salsa cart with some mediocore sauces. The salsa verde is lacking. The plain salsas have ok flavor but even the \"hot\" one is quite mild. The pico de gallo if pretty decent."}
{"text":"I have started going here for lunch on the regular. The ingredients used are better made and kept then at the other Phat Burrito (PB). The beans and rice are always warm and delicious, not dry or hard. The salsa bar is well kept. The menu options are the same as the other PB and they even have the same sweet/unsweet tea.

The service is pretty similar to the PB but the inside and seating are a little different. This location has more of an open dining area and a good deal more seating. I also love the fact that it's right next to Independence and Hawthorne park. On a nice day why eat inside Get your burrito and head to the park!"}
{"text":"Good place. Never judge a book by it's cover. I judged it because it was empty when we went in, but later reminded myself that it was because it was pouring heavily outside!
They have honor medals going back to 2005 and the place also looks great. The atmosphere gives you a kind of homie feeling and I liked that very much."}
{"text":"This is the best place for burritos in Charlotte.  Particularly recommend the vegetarian burrito.  Great atmosphere, cool staff and music, easily accessible from downtown, Dilworth, and South End.  As good as any burritos I've had in cities known for their burrito- like food, including LA."}
{"text":"i had quite an interesting experience on my first visit to phat burrito.  one soggy monday night, we decided to grab takeout from someplace nearby.  since it was getting very close to 9pm, we knew our decision needed to be made swiftly.  i'd heard from several people about how great phat burrito's food was, so i decided to place an order around 8:30pm that night.

the dude who answered the phone was definitely a character.  i ordered a chicken quesadilla, a steak burrito, a steak tortilla salad, and some extra guac.  he asked multiple times if i would make it there by 9, OR ELSE.  amused, i assured him we would be there right away.

phat burrito is located quite close to another southend staple - price's chicken coop.  it's situated on a corner across from price's with an incredibly small parking lot and an even smaller footprint.  inside are all the conforming trappings of a nonconformist establishment: revolutionary posters, indie rock band bumper stickers, pierced and dyed cooks, mismatched tables/chairs, and multicolored walls with appropriately peeling/scuffed edges.  it's definitely charming, and i loved how the clientele was a bit atypical - of course, you had your artsy crowd, but there were definitely some \"jocks\" and \"plastics\" mixed in (and who doubted i could make a mean girls reference on my blog!?  yep, that's what i thought!).  an array of patrons from differing backgrounds can only mean one thing in an establishment this kitsch . . . some darn good food.

i waited awhile for my eats, and when i made an inquiry to the neo-hippie manning the register, he informed me, with a bemused laugh, of the fact that the paper with my order had been \"lost,\" so would i mind giving it again.  i didn't mind, so i resubmitted my requests and waited for only a few minutes more before the aforementioned cook tossed it all together.  he handed me my bag of grub and i walked back over to the register . . . to wait again.  when neo-hippie noticed me a second time, he asked if anything was missing.  i told him, \"well, i haven't paid, yet.\"  he was actually shocked that i waited around to pay.

oh well.  maybe i should have bolted.

the food was great: cheap (less than $7 per item) and satisfying.  my favorite of the selections we made was definitely the salad.  the steak was well-marinated and didn't sport the texture of shoe leather (a welcome change).  the guac was a bit bland, but the avocados were fresh, so i tossed on some salt and dealt with it.  the runner-up was the burrito . . . i omitted the beans and loved how hearty and filling it was.  the quesadilla was probably the weakest link, but even then, it was still damn good.

phat burrito is definitely a joint for the mellow.  the people were very nice, if a bit scatterbrained, and the food took awhile, but was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Looking for a fun, creative atmosphere with amazing food? Anyone that visits Charlotte, NC or recently moved here needs to visit Phat Burrito. Hands down the coolest, yummiest place that sells literally \"PHAT\" burritos, quesadillas, salad bowls, and tacos. I consider this whole in the wall restaurant a land mark in Charlotte, NC. 
I enjoy eating any of the BBQ Steak entrees and plus they have a salsa bar where you can choose salsa flavor from mild to hotness. The burritos are big enough to share, but why not get your own because leftovers are a must. Not sure if their company makes their own bread, but its the freshest burrito I have ever eaten. Have a sweet tooth? The deserts are worth a purchase from cupcakes to brownies this place does no wrong. The atmosphere is relaxed with textured walls and art. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and laid back. I at least come here once a week for my BBQ steak fix and the prices are decent, but worth the money! Best Tex Mex in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good - #1 - Not a chain although a 2nd one is getting ready to open - bummer.
Food was good - stayed away from the meat - veggie burrito and salsa bar were both good.   I actually work right across the street - need to remind myself to go to Phat Burrito more often. Its  really quite good.  Oh and by the way - veggie burriot was HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"You'll LOVE anything you get at Phat Burrito. The atmosphere is great and the music is awesome, the staff is very friendly, and they have the BEST salsa and queso. You won't regret eating here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!"}
{"text":"Totally average food at this place.  Bland veggie burrito, couldn't find the steak in the steak burrito. Flies and gnats circled the restaurant. Looks dirty but had a 93 on cleanliness. Guacamole looked brown and had a date on the container that was 3 days ago."}
{"text":"Used to be much, much better. Last time we went the food was mediocre at best. Ambiance was never a strong suit, so when you're eating at a dirty burrito joint but your tacos are not good you know something is wrong with this spot."}
{"text":"I'll start of by saying that Phat Burrito's food is nothing to write home about.  I'm not saying that it's bad; I'm just saying that it's not exceptional. I'm always happy with the food and like to grab a couple fish tacos or a black bean quesadilla when I'm in the mood for one of those things.  So why do I give Phat 4 stars?  

I can't help but love this place.  I loved it when it was half the size and the area was a slight bit shadier than it is now.  I love the skater punks and the hemp hippies that work there.  Sometimes they miss an order and sometimes you have to wait while they make up for their mistake, but you just keep on loving it.  And while you're sitting and waiting for the missed order to be made you think \"damn, I wish I didn't work for Wells Fargo and could get stoned and ride a skateboard to work.\"  And that's why Phat Burrito gets 4 stars.  They are what the rest of us wish we could be:  cool."}
{"text":"Won't be back.  I was excited to see them in this location, I used to frequent the Southend PB.  After 2 bad experiences at this location I decided I wasn't going to try for a 3rd.  It's a little pricey for this type of food, waited one day a ridiculously long time for a veggie burrito to go.  The guy who ordered 2 orders after me even got  his order before I did.  What?  I got home and had a meat burrito, not cool... especially since I don't like red meat.  They seem disorganized and some of the staff completely clueless."}
{"text":"They have the best burritos I've had in a long time! I can't believe how huge they are. They live up to the name most definitely. I just wish there wasn't an upcharge for EVERYTHING... but other than that i have no complaints..great food great service"}
{"text":"After hearing all they hype I finally decided to check this place out and was not disappointed.  The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was very laid back.  I ordered the chicken burrito which was the side of my head, and also better than most of the ones you will find in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We used to love it here and I don't know what changed, but today it was awful and we won't be returning. Everyone in our group who was asked if they wanted guacamole or sour cream did not receive either. I ordered refried beans in my burrito and got black beans, the salsa bar is gone now, so you can't get as much as you need for a burrito because when you ask for salsa you are given one cup that contains two spoonfuls. This place used to be great, but it doesn't seem so anymore. $25 for two disappointing burritos. Had three bites and I'm done."}
{"text":"My son and I are huge fans of Phat Burrito! We would eat there twice a week probably if I was comfortable allowing us to eat out that often. We particularly love riding our bikes up on a nice day and enjoying our food on the patio. 

I typically order two black bean tacos with everything and my son orders both cheese quesadillas and steak quesadillas. My tacos are always so full that they really could have been made into three. I like to top them with the delicious tomatillo salsa and the hot salsa, which admittedly could be a little hotter. But, luckily they offer fresh (not pickled) jalapenos! 

I have seen that some other reviewers felt that they received poor or unfriendly service and I hate to see that. In my experience, the employees have always been extremely nice and helpful, it is one of the draws for us. Not to mention, they always get our food to us quickly! The prices are very reasonable and they are locally owned! 

And to top it all off, they grow some of the items on location, definitely the cabbage for the fish tacos and maybe other things (it was cold weather when I noticed.) Now that the weather is warming up, I can update this if I see that they grow other veggies."}
{"text":"Great cheap spot to eat with huge portions. I am big dude and I couldn't put down all of my steak burrito. Service was fast and friendly and there is a pretty good variety of items to add to your burrito or whatever it is that you order. I prefer this spot much more than Moe's. Midday there may not be enough seating so be prepared to eat in your car."}
{"text":"I've had just about everything on their menu.......everything is good, though I'm not sure there is anything worth raving about.  Portions are as you would expect, the price is on par with similar establishments, and the service is OK (interpret:  order at the counter, have a seat, then pick up when they call your name).

Typical menu options:  burritos, quesadillas, salads, tacos, etc.  Similar to a Qdoba, Chipotle, or Moes but less of a chain restaurant feel.  Recently I noticed a BBQ chicken burrito/taco on their menu that sounded like a nice change of pace.  Next time.

Other reviewers have referred to this place as \"quirky.\"  That's probably a good word.  I think Charlotte needs more places like this..... Charlotte is just too squeaky clean.

Oh - the outdoor patio, while small, is a fun space to drink a few Coronas during nice weather.  

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this little jem.

The burritos are the best thing here.

Prices are cheap, cheap, cheap.

Ingredients are fresh.

The staff is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Very simple restaurant methodology.. Order, prep and serve. The restaurant decor is a hodgepodge of latter year Phat taco memorabilia, with aged booths that add character, 6 bar stools and nice selection of tables. If your arriving with a group greater than ten be prepared to wait. Very relaxing atmosphere and Great staff. 

Foodie time.. I ordered a fish, bbq steak/chicken, steak taco searching for a quick variety. The fish taco is awesome  (carries much of the weight for the 3star review) everything else left much to be desired. Steak taco was less than moist and lacked seasoning (personal palette). Requesting BBQ tacos means just that a tangy flavored sauce that knocks your socks off, however does not over power the protein selected. These left much to be desired, not one to bash, I will return for the fish taco times 3."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, casual place for a great burrito.  I have been going here for over 10 years and I've always had a great meal.  It is a little bit of a hike for me to get there but well worth it!  The chicken & beef burritos are very tasty and the salsa is awesome (they have many to choose from). I recently tried the fish tacos for the first time and they were also very good.  I highly recommend this place - the food is great!"}
{"text":"I got excited the first time i saw this place when i moved to charlotte from wilmington, nc. i wanted to love it and thought it would be a good substitute since flaming amy's burrito barn was no longer right around the corner. I was a little disappointed. It wasn't a bad burrito, but it was a very basic burrito. Salsa was pretty good. i'll probably be back, but won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Best burritos in CLT, and cool staff and vibe.  I worked near South End until recently, and the main thing I miss about not working there is being able to grab the awesome lunch at this place.  Sanitary, it does not appear to be.  Delicious, it is."}
{"text":"Best burritos in town! They are the size of your arm!"}
{"text":"LOVE Phat Burrito. They have fantastic food here... I almost always get a quesadilla and chips w/ queso. They have, hands down, the BEST queso I can remember eating. I don't care that their chips are bagged, although I do wish there were a few more in the bag.

Their soup is great, too. I'm also a sweet tea snob and they have great sweet tea!

This is a place I frequent for lunch, and I'm never disappointed. Not a long wait, staff is friendly... oh! And they have really good brownies!"}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ steak burrito & found it pretty bland and lacked some variety.  I've had better burritos.  Won't be going there anytime soon. :-("}
{"text":"I have enjoyed eating at fat burrito for years. Every time I go, they deliver with the same great quality and yesterday was no exception. 

There are so many great things on the menu from the burritos to the quesadillas. I particularly love the chicken soft tacos. 

Their variety of fresh-made salsas are among the best. Do yourself a favor and get a side of case so dip with whatever you get. That stuff is awesome."}
{"text":"A very good burrito establishment with very poor parking.
Another place close to the light rail and worth the stop off the train riding into town or leaving town."}
{"text":"The beef burrito was okay.  The portion was great (really big).  I didn't really like the beef, it's more of the braised cheaper beef.  I would go back; but, I think I will try something else."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with food. Service was great for a take out order. Very nice people to few customers strolling in. I like the bbq steak taco (size & General flavor) more than the chicken burrito. Chicken has no flavor and rice was dry brittle not cooked right.

Expected better than Moe's but less than actual Mexican place and it fell short."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito. Did the job. Slightly pricier then Qdoba. Didn't include guac. But fat(phat), filling, and pretty good. Only pet peeve was when someone started sweeping around my table while eating. I hate it when people do that.

{"text":"Best burrito in Charlotte? I was visiting from out of town. So if that's true, charlotte must lacking in the burrito department. It was ok, by no means great. Staff was friendly. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Wow - this restaurant USED to be an asset to the Southend area - but not anymore!  It's hard to believe people still eat here???  The food is total bland central - no flavor, or if you happen to get some flavor they way over do it - for example their bbq tacos which used to be great, except the last time I ordered them they were so HOT filled with jalapenos I couldn't even eat them.  The refried beans are straight from the can - I don't think they even take the time to heat them if you have a to go order. AND the staff - seriously need a few lessons in customer service and common courtesy.  The owner/manager or whomeven hired these people clearly is ready for their restaurant to close - permanently.  I will recommend to everyone I know to never EVER go to a place that has no clue on how to make a good burrito and no clue how to ensure a pleasurable dining experience for anyone who mistakingly chooses to eat there. 

Don't waste your money people - Salsaritas or Chipotle or even a burrito that was throw on the ground and stepped on are all way better choices."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted something quick for lunch. I've heard about PB, and was expecting a long wait time but I was pleasantly surprised by the movement of the line. Chicken burrito was good and filling and the staff was pleasant. Nice experience overall and will return."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  Prices are pretty high in my opinion.  Staff is really friendly and food comes out quick.  If it wasn't overpriced, I'd be more inclined to give 4 stars."}
{"text":"The burritos definitely live up to the name.  This thing was huge and not just full of rice and toppings but, more than enough steak.  The steak was very tender with nice spicy BBQ flavor.  I was thinking I'll never be able to finish this thing but, it was so delicious I couldn't stop eating.  Hats off to the folks at Phat Burrito.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good employees me and a friend got 2 tacos but when we tried to order more stuff the employee hooked us up with free food"}
{"text":"Decent burrito shop. 4 stars for inviting atmosphere,  and for being one of the only burrito shops around. Order your food then pick your sauce on the side. The music they played was solid gold oldies. That's a plus. The chef is very enthusiastic about getting the food out. Some of the tables do have business card under them, so bring yours. It's also a couple minutes from the lite rail station.
-1 star for  average tasting burritos. 
Also the parking lot is small and crammed."}
{"text":"This is one place that doesn't care... In a good way. They do what they do GREAT! This isn't chipotle so get that out of your head. Great food every time I visit. Pretty much weekly."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a business trip to Charlotte.   Great outdoor seating area that gives nice views of downtown.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The food is of normal bar food quality, but the price matches well with the quality.   Overall a great place to stop of you want lower priced, average but tasty food, and prompt efficient service."}
{"text":"I do not live in the area so when I found myself getting my hair done right up the road, I was unsure where to go. One of the girls at the salon suggested Phat Burrito and being the burrito lover that I am, was really excited. I walked in and was not too impressed. The menu was poorly displayed and I really didn't like the fact that I couldn't see what came on each burrito. I ordered the fish burrito with tallapia. I got my burrito, which was huge and took a bite. I was starving so I was excited to eat something that I usually get a lot of satisfaction out of. I immediately tasted this disgusting sweet mango salsa. I was really confused because when the person who took my order went through the toppings, he never mentioned this concoction. I really do not like mangos and tried to open the burrito up and eat it with a fork, that didn't help. Overall, I was not satisfied with my $10 purchase. I was really disappointed and my lunch date who ordered a chicken burrito shared my sentiments. I might go back and try something else but probably not by choice."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful, Phat Burrito's food is a really tasty example of California burritos. The giant burritos and quesadillas are worth a drive across town. The barbecue steak and chicken are stand-outs on the menu, but a simple bean burrito with red beans is just as satisfying. And the veggie burrito is full of squash and zucchini as well as the standard sauteed peppers and onions. Stop at the salsa bar, but skip the chips--they're obviously out of a bag (and not that good of one, either)."}
{"text":"Man these sure are some good burrito's amigo's. Wish there was one next door but then I would gain thousands of pounds. LOL"}
{"text":"Large portions- sometimes staff is rude but the steak burritto with guac and sour cream - prepared with the hot sauce - YUMMMM"}
{"text":"I went here with a small group for a birthday lunch. I usually just walk to eat but this a little too long for a lunch time walk from downtown. I am glad we got there at 11:30 or we would not have been able to sit together. 
The food was pretty good (better than Cabo fish taco, don't shoot me). I had a bean burrito that was about 3 lbs (half is in the work fridge) and super delicious! The others at the table got BBQ steak and BBQ chicken quesadillas, they also enjoyed their lunch. 
The food was made fresh to order, subway style. It was definitely good enough to throw it into my lunch rotation, when I am willing to drive."}
{"text":"I've been eating burritos and salads here for years, but the last couple of times have been terrible. When I bought the most recent steak burrito, I saw that one of the cooks shook a lot of black pepper (excessive) on food. I didn't realize until I got home that it was my steak burrito! I don't think I'll ever return no matter how hungry I am."}
{"text":"Fast and awesome. I like the local culture and laid back vibe. The queso is delicious!  One of my favorite parts is the salsa bar - make sure you check it out.

I always choose Phat Burrito over the nearby Chipotle.  You can't beat the feel of the place and the diverse menu offerings."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is named appropriately because the burritos are HUUUUGE!

I haven't been out here in years, but last night a burrito craving hit while we were in South End, so we swung on by. This place is a small place located right near the light rail. There is some seating indoors and an outdoor patio.

We ordered the fish burrito to split, chips and queso, and two Modelos.....$16! What a steal! We sung by the salsa bar next....who doesnt love a salsa bar!

The burrito came out and it was the size of my face. Literally. More than enough food for the two of us! The burrito was excellent and the mango in it was a great touch. The queso was an excellent portion. We sat outside and enjoyed our beers and food. I definitely won't be letting another year go by before we come back again!"}
{"text":"I love the Fish Tacos or Fish Quesadilla, that mango salsa and red cabbage have me addicted! I've been a big fan of this place for more than 10 years, I've witnessed some crazy things happen here that could have easily sent me running for the hills - but the food is too good to not come back! The Steak tacos are my next favorite item.. the burritos have always been a little lacking in my opinion though.. and occasionally the service is less than accommodating, but its a small price to pay when you're hungry for the best fish tacos EVER!"}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos I've ever eaten. 

Also a bit random for a burrito place, but their cupcakes they keep by the register are AMAZING. Seriously. Try the \"key lime pie\", it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"I love this funky, eclectic little hole in the wall. When I lived in Charlotte I'd drop in for lunch or dinner. It's not necessarily 'Mexican', but it is amazingly delicious! Portions are large and prices are reasonable for the area.

I usually just order the tacos so I can get a few different flavors, but the burritos and quesadillas are well worth your time, too. You can personalize all the items(eg: you hate beans with a passion surpassing reason, rice reminds you of larvae...whatever your deal is) and then pick your order up at the counter and meander over to the salsa bar and pick up some salsa verde or extra hot...or even mild, if you like. It's fresh and ready to drown your food in a flavor explosion.

If you're heading downtown to go to a concert, I'd recommend eating here and then taking the lightrail to avoid a parking mess. If it's a nice night, there are tables out on the patio/corner to enjoy."}
{"text":"we had a bbq steak burrito yesterday. all rice and beans no steak.and a bbq chicken burrito.
bland ,boring and the chicken was way to dry.the guacamole and chips please chips in a bag
for $4.disgraceful.definitely will not be back"}
{"text":"Good old stand by lunch-  quesadilla with chips!  Quick and tasty.  Parking is a little challenging but doesn't ruin the experience.

Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Between the laid back people and atmosphere and the bomb-diggity fish burrito I had, this will definitely be my go to joint for any type of fish tacos/burritos. The mango salsa on top was awesome and the fish within my burrito was super fresh. There was a place in NoDa that was my go to fish taco place which I will not name but this place beats the heck out of them. It's been around in Charlotte for awhile and now I know why. Will definitely come back!  If you are in the South End area of Charlotte check it out yo! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Favorite burritos in Charlotte! They're a good size and definitely enough for a meal in its own. They make them fresh right in front of you. Staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"When you walk into an establishment and George Clinton is playing, you know it's going to be an interesting experience. After four years in this city I finally decided to give it a shot thanks to a coupon for a free entree + drink. I've always been curious about this place with it's eccentric outside decor, bars on the windows plus I like with things starting with F but are spelled out PH (however I hate when things that start with C are spelled out with a K but that's besides the point). I went right after work and there were only two other people in there....unheard of! Part of the reason I've never been is because the parking lot is full and I can't find anywhere to park so I was pleased to know I would finally get my Phat on. Even though the smell of Price's was in the air, I was still ready to try PB.

I got a chicken burrito to go and it was ready in less than 5 mins. It seemed like there were two people working that shift so I was surprised with the turn around time. When I got home and sat down to eat, I unwrapped the foil around the burrito and holy crap---it was bigger than my dogs head (see pics)! Boo ya! Super tasty and I didn't have to add any salsa or hot sauce. It was perfect just the way it was. It wasn't too dry but at the same time wasn't sopping wet and falling apart. For Mexican in a pinch, this will be my new go to spot....but only if I can find a parking spot."}
{"text":"When you first see the outside of Phat Burrito, you immediately think of a hippie burrito joint you might see if you're in Santa Cruz or Berkeley. You know you're not in for a traditional Mexican experience, but more of a phunky, philling meal fit for a hungry, money-starved college student.

The quesadillas, tacos and burritos are all big. The variety is awesome. I'm usually satisfied going on the healthier side with the veggie (which I gladly ruin with cheese, guac and sour cream options), but I've also enjoyed going for the BBQ chicken and fish. I love the choice of beans as well.

The chips aren't special. I get them for a crunch on the side, although half the time I don't really need them because I get so full fast (and I'm a pretty big dude). 

They're also an excuse to keep hitting the fresh salsa bar. I can get enough of mixing the mild and hot in different combinations. The smokey chipotle-style flavor is awesome.

All the ingredients they put in the burritos taste fresh. An unusual twist that works is Indian-style Basmati rice. They also have expanded and opened up the dining area, and now have easier parking around them.

I kind of strayed away from this place to check out other Mexican places in the area, and of course, the Chipotle not too far on South Blvd. I had this a lot when I first moved here two years ago, when I lived and worked just down the street.

I have rediscovered it, and although I can't eat here more than once a month or so, it's always a worthy trip."}
{"text":"Ok, I think we all know that phat burrito is not authentic mexican but neither is taco bell.Lol But their food is pretty good and the people are awsome. The ingredences are very fresh and  the food is tastie. The atmospher is really chill, and you have a choice of eating in or out which both are great. I would tell anyone to go there"}
{"text":"Customer service is top notch! You can tell each employee is genuine & wants to help! The food is delicious and location is convenient."}
{"text":"2 things every good burrito place has; Queso Dip & Chips. Unfortunately, PB falls short in these categories. I'd consider this establishment a poor man's Sabor. 

I ordered the quesadilla based on other Yelpers reviews. The quesadilla alone would have gotten 4 out of 5 stars. The blackened chicken was tasty, right amount of cheese and big! It was served with sour cream. The taste wasn't incredibly unique. 

The salsa was just meh. Tasted like something I've bought at the store. 

I really wanted to dig this place cause the vibe is cool, staff was crazy friendly and feels like a hidden local spot but the food falls short."}
{"text":"If you've ever had a good burrito, you won't like this place. Food is boring. It's fine, but just blahhhh ya know 
No sauces, no spices, no seasoning. Just food shoved into a tortilla"}
{"text":"The manager at phat burrito is a racist, she has called numerous black employees n****** and has said and I quote \"you have to put black people and Mexicans in the box otherwise they will steal from you and slack off\". DO NOT GO HERE. The food is not properly handled and is reheated and cooled down at least 10 times before it is served on the line. I am a former employee who was forced to quit because the manager was giving me and my partners medical information to other employees."}
{"text":"I like a burrito...but at this point am bored of black and pinto beans.  Phat burrito comes to the rescue with unexpected red beans. Yay!  My veggie burrito was big, messy, and delicious!"}
{"text":"2 stars because of their salsa bar. That's about it.... Their food lacks some serious flavor/taste. The rice in the burrito is so bland. Bathroom smells like a porto-potty.I'm sure this place has potential, but I'll let someone else experience that."}
{"text":"It has been several years since I have eaten here because I moved to a different part of the city. 
Overall I am very disappointed, especially given that we drove so far to get here. This place was once my go-to burrito restaurant and I visited often in its early years. 
Now it's just another burrito place. The food isn't especially good and certainly not memorable. It borders on bland. 
Customer service was abysmal. The guy at the register seemed to have chip on his shoulder. 
The restaurant, while never known for cleanliness, was even worse today. Lots of debris on the floor and the tables weren't clean.  This was once a hip alternative place, but now it has just a ghetto vibe. 
It is sad that one of my old favs has degraded so far;  I will likely never return."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos! I like the bbq chicken tacos & the fish tacos. The simple food is always tasty & delicious. I also like the bbq chicken burrito. The chips are good too. The outdoor patio is nice in the fall & right by the light rail.  They have a tiny parking lot so park on the street if you can."}
{"text":"Went in for a burrito and ordered the bbq steak burrito. The large menu right behind the counter clearly lists this item for $7.78. I did not order anything else (not even water cup). The cashier typed in the order and it came up as 8 something which then brought my total to $9 after tax. I asked the cashier what the price was and he mumbled $8 thirty something. I informed him that the menu says that it should only be $7.78 and he did not reply. I said it again and he then rudely said \"well, there's nothing I can do\" without looking at me and in a way that made it seem like he though that it was my problem not his. I told him that he should tell somebody else then because it's not right to list a price as one thing and charge another price without any explanation, to which he did not reply and continued to not make eye contact with me as he did the whole time I was in the restaurant. 
So either the company lies about their prices or their employees ring up the wrong prices and do not care whatsoever if the customer gets screwed. Either way I am not returning to the terrible and unwelcoming environment created by the cashier. Lastly, the bbq steak burrito was nothing special and the salsa bar was gone. Absolutely do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is as good as a Burrito place can get. I've had a lot of burritos in my day and I think the one thing that sets this place apart is the freshness of the ingredients. Also, the salsa bar is a huge plus with its serve yourself style. It's not the largest or classiest place in charlotte by any stretch of the imagination but it for sure has a local following with people who have eaten there. The pricing delivers a good value for the amount of food you get and you never seem to leave feeling hungry. The staff seems to have about zero turnover which also says something about a place that has been in business for several years. Happy employees seem to make for good food and service. Another plus is that it use to be a \"cash only\" establishment but they have recently added debit cards so its easier to pay for your Phat Burrito"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Love it! Minus one star because the place is a tad bit dirty. Staff is nice overall and pleasant. Parking is tricky though. Luckily, the Bland St light rail stop is a short distance away. A must go spot!"}
{"text":"I love this new addition to the Elizabeth neighborhood! The decor is perfect for the area, and the food is to die for. My personal favorite is the BBQ steak burrito with some chips and queso. The salsa bar features fresh pico de gallo(my favorite). Quick service and great food; what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Love anyplace that has amazing vegan options!  The tofu burrito was soooo good!  And their house made hot sauces were pretty amazing, too!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I bought two  BBQ steak soft tacos and they were very spicy hot!  I Had to pay for another plain cheese wrap, though I only took one bite. Disappointing.  The
Burritos are big.  Would be nice to have more details on menu. I can see it being a favorite if you like hot and spicy burritos and food! The staff never broke a smile. : ("}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and for all the people who say \"don't let the outside scare you\" - that's after a renovation, haha. it used to be MUCH scarier. The owner put in decent patio furniture, lights, music, flowers, and fresh paint. If you sit at just the right spot on the patio you have a great view of downtown and the wonderfully ugly pink building. The inside isn't much to look at but at least now they have central heat/air and not a window unit that leaks on you. And the art you see on the walls is up for grabs, normally.
As for the food - not authentic mexican - not meant to be. They're burritos, quesadillas, nachos, tacos.... and the most delicious salsa EVER! I don't like quesadillas but I like them here. But whenever I come back to town I get a chicken burrito, black beans, rice, hold the cheese, lettuce, tomatos, sour cream and guac.... lots of guac :-) I eat half there and visit with the staff (V & Kelly are AMAZING) and take the rest for the trip home. 
It's within walking distance of some other kewl shops and even Amos' so hit up Phat Burriito before going to a show or out for drinks! 
Oh! And the brownies they buy from local bakers are out of this world!"}
{"text":"WTF!!!! The burritos used to be large!, I have ordered the block for 2 days and received 4 different sizes of burritos, I complained to staff and they said the owner said to reduce the size.  The price or name did not change.  The place is called PHAT burrito, not medium burrito, or skinny burrito.  Get this fixed!!!!! The taste is the same but the standards in the place are degrading, floors dirty, bugs, general unkempt appearance.  Whimsical is cool but it is looking a bit neglected.

Fix this Shit!!!!"}
{"text":"First time - the person who took my order gave me a great run-down of the place and how to order.  I got a chicken quesadilla and my boyfriend got different tacos (fish, beef and chicken).... needless to say everything was amazing!  The hot salsa in the salsa bar was actually HOT salsa unlike everywhere else where you get subpar warm salsa.... it was a great experience and I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Just okay. I debated between 2 and 3 stars. 3 was probably overly generous. I remembered this place being better. There are a lot of better places in the South End area. My beer wasn't even that cold and my quesadilla was mediocre at best. The last time I got a burrito it was better than the quesadilla but I returned to work only to find that they had left the cheese off of it. What is a burrito without cheese?:("}
{"text":"If you like burrito's this is as good as it gets! Move over Moe's, Qdoba, Tijuana Flats and Sulsaritas you have nothing to compare to Phat burrito. I wish I was closer to Phat Burrito and could go there more because it is super tasty. I prefer the fish burrito with there lovely mango salsa that they put on it but you really cant go wrong with anything there. Its not the fanciest place by all means but they have a real relaxed atmosphere and the staff really seems to enjoy working there."}
{"text":"Food was okay, had the steak burrito and it was not too tasty. Food wasn't too fresh and it meat was a little dry. Could see where it's a cool place to hang in the spring and summer months!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner and was really pumped when I saw this Phat Burrito open up.  It ended up being a very average burrito joint, more like below average.  Very inconsistent, felt dirty, pass.

**Update**  This place is now closed, thank God.  Check out the new place though, Sabor.  They're cooking up some great Latin street food."}
{"text":"Really good tex mex joint in South End. This place is REALLY small! Lunch time on weekdays is a challenge, so long as you don't mind saying \"excuse me, can you pass me a salsa cup and a straw?\" It's advisable to get your order to go, unless you can get a seat at one of their 3 tables outside. The bbq chicken quesadilla is really good. Better than Moe's , better than Salsarita's."}
{"text":"Searching for decent Mexican food in Charlotte is like looking for Big Foot.  Just when you think you spotted him, he disappears.  

Phat's is a burrito \"get it and go\" type place.  Not an authentic Mexican restaurant.  I'll get the major downer out of the way first, their chips and guacamole is pretty disappointing.  I've had better chips from Tostitos.  As a matter of fact, I think they were tricolor Tostitos.  The burritos are fair.  Not good or great - fair.  

They \"almost\" have a dining room but that's beside the point.  If the food warranted it, I would come here every week.  It's a decent neighborhood spot that I will probably try again if I'm in the area but there's absolutely no reason to go out of my way to trek here on a regular basis.  I really don't understand five stars for a mediocre burrito and brown guacamole.  But if you come here with low expectations you just might like it."}
{"text":"Tasty and reasonably priced. Their burritos really hit the spot, and once you've been...you're addicted. They serve up some of the best burritos...and yes, they definitely are phat."}
{"text":"So much yes. I judge Mexican restaurants on their cheese dip & Phat Burrito's passed. Their burritos are legitimately pretty hot and tempting. Heard it's like a Chipotle, but I personally think this place is better. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Phatty Phatty Two by Four, this is what you chant after eating their humongous burritos!  Great little spot to sit outside, drink a beer and support local business!  Yay, everything I love.  What I like best is their chalkboard that reads:  Be nice or leave.  This should be everywhere."}
{"text":"YES! Just YES!!! Finally, after much disappointment in Charlotte,  this west-coast girl found a good hand-held burrito. Not only that, but it's a \"fast-food\" burrito that knows how to cook tofu! I ordered just a basic bean, cheese, and rice. My husband ordered the tofu burrito with red beans. They were both amazing. Full of flavor, and unique. The tofu was cooked well, firm, with lots of flavor. The rice was well cooked with a light cilantro flavor. The beans and rice are all vegetarian friendly. The tortillas were soft and flakey. Overall this place was amazing. Definitely comparable to some burrito places I've been to in San-Diego. 

My only complaint is the fact that none of the salsas in the salsa bar are spicy. However; they were each amazingly unique and added a great flavor to the already amazing burritos."}
{"text":"I can see what's awesome about Phat Burrito. Burritos come in seven varieties and look like an awesome alternative to the commandeering Chipotle. The location is also pretty sweet: a yellowy concrete block with a nice patio that's right off of the Lynx. It'd be nice on sunny Saturdays (which Charlotte has been having a burrito-sized amount of). With all of this, I was pretty excited to try out this joint.

When I went, the inside just didn't seem very welcoming. There was a little bit of natural daylight, but without a whole lot of other lighting. Add some metal fixtures and low ceilings, and the place didn't feel \"phunky,\" it felt \"phfeeling-less.\"

As far as the massive (7\"x3\") burritos. Ever notice how burrito fillings seem to be compartmentalized, where one bite is just a glob of sour cream, where the next is beans, and the next is a bit of guacamole with a spare bean? This is not the case at PB, where the fillings are incorporated well. The sour cream is the base, not a section of the burrito, which I thought was great. The flavor itself is all right: a bean-rich San Fran-style burrito, but not something I'd pack my bags for. Add that chips aren't included (did John Locke include \"free chips\" in his list of basic human rights?), making for a satisfactory experience, but not one for repeats.

While I'm curious if it's any different a night-time, I'm not sure if I'd go back to find out. It wasn't a bad time, just an A-OK time."}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a week. Great food and super cool people! BBQ tacos are my favorite. Always fresh pico and sauces. Parking is adequate even mid-day."}
{"text":"I'm OK with Phat Burrito. 

I've had their shrimp tacos & they were just OK. Shrimp were very tiny & chewy.  Now I've had their steak tacos & they're much better.  
The chips are my favorite. Ooooh & the salsa bar! THAT is something to brag about! So many flavors & temperatures of salsa.

It really is a hole in the wall, it's kinda dark & not much ambiance.  The staff there is always nice & friendly. Service is pretty quick. They serve beer there, so for beer drinkers, that should make you happy. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Phat Burrito several times over the years and have always loved the location. It attracts all types of people in the Southend area. Hipsters, skaters, local biz owners, and Uptown bankers alike.

 There's something on the menu for everyone. Burritos, salad, quesadillas and all of the different toppings/fillings you could imagine. Upon our last visit, I decided to try out a quesadilla after getting a burrito each previous visit. Can't say that I was blown away, but it was reliable. If you're hungry and craving meat and cheese between two tortillas, you can't go wrong. 

There was something really odd about the salsas that day, too. The medium variety seemed to have a very \"astringent\" sensation/flavor that was very unpleasant. Typically, the salsa bar is the best party, but must have been an off day. No biggy, though. My wife tried the salad which was great. Huge torta next to a generous piling of lettuce, beans and all of the fixins'. It was a winner. 

A great little spot with great outdoor seating and mediocre seating inside. It can be a little crammed around lunchtime, so taking it to go or even eating out of your car may be in the cards. I think for the price (close to $19 for the both of us with only water to drink) in conjunction with the lack of splendor, it's not a top priority on my list to pilgrimage for lunch/dinner, but always love to stop in when on business/pleasure/errands in Southend."}
{"text":"I really want to like this Phat Burrito location. I'll even admit that I wish I could like it more than the Southend location, but this one has some serious ground to cover before I'll head back in. 

In the location where Snoops used to be, and not much aesthetically has changed since the inception of PB, a great spot for a quick lunch or sustenance from an afternoon in Independence Park. The interior definitely isn't inviting. There are some seriously creepy decor items that look like they were plucked hastily from the garbage. The booths are re-purposed from who knows where and have some noticeable wear to them. 

I had asked about how they prepare their fish and I received several stares as if I had grown three heads. I asked if it were prepared with butter as opposed to oil. Their response: \"It's grilled.\" Well, thanks for that beautiful diatribe of information, but didn't get me very far. I had to repeat the question for an answer. I just laughed. I mean, come on. That's just hilarious. 

My biggest guff is with the service. Shocker. The kid at the counter was one of the strangest people I've had the obligatory need to work with. He was wearing a pair of headphones around his neck, barely seemed to care that I was ordering with my friend, and did some things that were just a little too strange to comprehend. I needed my receipt and upon asking for it, he grabbed it from the trash and un-crumpled it in front of me and handed back....No words, brosef. 

The food, per usual, was passable. Decent flavor, salsas are mediocre, and the price is a little steep. I do really dig their grilled veggies, though. 

Can't say that I'm looking to head back in any time soon to this location, but I'm glad Southend still holds it down. I really hope this location improves. I love where it's located in Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I'm going to say....Good..but not impressed. Went for breakfast. I'm used to SoCal burritos. BIG! These were your typical burritos you can easily make at home. It didn't fill me up, in would of had to buy 2 to feel fulfilled. Price isn't made but I wouldn't mind pay double for a nice big fat long burrito. 
Would recommend this for a quick SNACK but not a meal."}
{"text":"It's 2 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon and I'm wondering how I got from planning a light scone-centric lunch to sitting in South End polishing off a burrito the size of my head. Now matter how, I suppose, the point is that I was having Phat Burrito for lunch. A chicken buritto with black beans (you get your choice of black, red or refried), rice, sour cream and onto which I was forking heaps of hot salsa from the salsa bar.

It was good. Fairly similar to your standard massive burrito chain, say Qdoba or Chipotle, but with that good feeling you get from eating at a local joint. The counter staff looks like a flashback from my days of frequenting skater punk and ska concerts but they were friendly and handled my corny humor well enough. I like that they had counter space that I could park my lone wolf self at because nothing makes me feel more alone than a 4 person booth to myself. The salsa...it said hot, and maybe to someone else it would be, but i feel like if you are going to offer a range of heat levels one of them should actually live up to the name hot. No dice. I must admit I was a little bummed that there was no pork option. Chicken, beef, spinach, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken or veggie, sure. Pork, no. Dang.

All in all, if i were down in south end and really hungry I might head to Phat Burrito again, but you probably wont hear me raving about it at the next UYE."}
{"text":"A solid effort. Food-wise this location tastes about the same as the original South End location. I still recommend you get the delicious salsa from the salsa bar. Atmosphere-wise something is just missing. It was impossible for me to walk into this more orderly location and not yearn for the funkiness that is Phat Burrito South End.

If you are hungry for the tortilla foods and in the neighborhood it certainly beats hitting up the Chipotle,  Seriously, PB is still my favorite burrito joint in Charlotte. But if you are craving Phat Burrito for Phat Burrito's sake, then go the extra few minutes to hit up the original."}
{"text":"Great place for burritos, quesadillas or salad. Go here instead of Chipotle. Staff is always very friendly and hard working. I eat here at least once per week. My only beef is paying $7 for a cheese quesadillas but it is delicious so worth the price."}
{"text":"Update!  I tried it again last night because I WANT it to work.  There have been some improvements:  the small claustrophobic space has expanded to include a new and improved seating area.  The chips still look like tostitos but they are no longer tri-colored and the guac (which I did not try) looked much better this time around.  The steak was still a bit dry but in a pinch I would go here again.

This is what goes for authentic Mexican around here?  Sorry, but coming from Chicago I've had my share of tacos, sometimes eating them three or four times a week.  Love 'em.  The burrito I got at Phat Burrito is the only reason there are three stars.  That and the staff seemed pretty nice.  However, no way are tri-colored tostitos real nacho chips.  And I've never had more watery guacamole.  Really not very good and definitely disappointing.  I may try this place again, but it's not at the top of my list.  I'd rather spend the extra $$ and get great tacos at Cantina."}
{"text":"I've heard legends and tall tales about Phat Burrito for years now.  I feel like every time someone brings up Johnny Burrito or Chipotle in Best Burrito Conversations, someone inevitably chimes in with a vote for Phat Burrito.  But just like the talk of legends such as Big Foot and the Loch Nest Monster, I thought Phat Burrito was just that;  talk. 

With that being said, I went to Phat Burrito (PB) this afternoon for lunch.  This was my first and only time going to Phat Burrito and beyond what was contained in the menu online (http://www.phatburrito.com/home/phatburrito-menu.php), I really didn't know what to expect.  First thing that stood out to me was the tricky parking situation at PB.  Just like the mafia, its easy to get in, but hard to get out.  

Upon parking, and going inside, I noticed the inside felt tight and and bit cramped.  There were plenty of people already sitting at tables and a few peeps standing in line placing orders.  My friend ordered the steak burrito (w/black beans, sour cream, but no guac).  I ordered the BBQ Steak burrito (w/ refried beans and both sour cream and guac).  While we waited for our burritos to be made, we went to the little salsa bar in the back and fixed ourselves a few cups of the different salsas.  I heard someone yell, \"TREY!\" from behind the counter and I knew our burritos were ready to be devoured.  

The BBQ STEAK Burrito I ordered was splendid.  There seemed to be plenty of steak (they didn't short me on the meats as others have stated).  The BBQ flavor was slow to hit me, but after a few moments of chewing...THERE it is!  That sweet BBQ sauce amalgamated well with the guac, cheese, sour cream, refried beans and the freshly made salsa.  Just like a colony of ants, all of the ingredients worked as one.  It was unlike any other taste I've ever experienced, and instantly had me wanting to come back again!  I tasted my friend's steak burrito and can say it was not nearly as good as the BBQ STEAK burrito.  I also think you have to add both GUAC and SOUR CREAM to maximize your taste experience.  Nonetheless, it was still well above par.  

The service was great.  The bro who took our order was cool, and very personable.  I can concur with other reviews which mentioned that the inside was a little grimy.  While I appreciated that aspect of PB, my date was a bit turned off by it.  

Today, Phat Burrito made me a believer.  Today I found out that legends of magical burritos aren't the stuff of legends at all - they are indeed real...Real good and tasty, that is...and just like Arnold, \"I'll BE BACK.\""}
{"text":"This place has everything I could want in a rad burrito joint, but good burritos: hard beans (with watery bean juice); mushy flavorless rice; skimpy on the meat innards. Get anything but...      (the burrito)

I do like the other menu items, but a burrito joint MUST have good burritos."}
{"text":"Whats not to like?

This latest incarnation of Phat Burrito packs all the flavor, vibe, and service as the original Phat, and maybe even a touch more... 

I usually run the BBQ Steak Burrito with sour cream and guac (they are extra, but are well worth it).  Usually the food arrives within 3-4 mins of ordering.  In this case, my BBQ steak burrito arrived in a brown paper bag.  I made sure to grab three to four cups of the salsa from the salsa bar before lugging my brick of a burrito home to devour it.  

The burrito was real and spectacular!  It was huge and looked bigger once I unwrapped it (that's what she said) from the foil.  They really create a unique flavor as the BBQ steak and grilled onions commingle in the warm confines of the burrito with refried beans, cheese, rice, etc.  I like their burrito because they are big enough so that one could satiate your hunger for a loooong time.  The guac was decent however I didn't like that it was not evenly distributed throughout my burrito - instead in was all gobbed in the back of the burrito and I ate it all in one bite.  Otherwise the burrito was awesome and perhaps a touch bigger than the burritos at the South End location.  I would highly recommend it to any burrito fan.  

As far as the service was concerned - no complaints.  As always, every employee was chill and friendly.  I've been here three times now, and the service has been exemplary every time.  There was also plenty of parking in a well lit area.  Parking at this location is also preferable to the original one.   

Enviably the question arises - Where can the best burrito be found in Charlotte?  Well you're in luck.  Here is my Official Best Burrito in Charlotte List:  For me Phat Burrito, especially this new location is a slight notch above Chipotle, followed by Johnny Burrito, Qdoba and Salsaritas (Moe's doesn't even make the list)."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place forever.  Being from CA was hoping to find a good burrito place.  This was not it..sadly...salad was small, my DH went back and asked for more, it was a child's portion.  Crazy for $8.  Burrito was boring...guess I will have to keep my burrito search going!"}
{"text":"The food is about what you'd find at any burrito place. I didn't think the food was head and shoulders above Moe's or Chipotle. I'm going with 4 stars for a few reasons. First is that it's a local establishment, and I enjoy supporting those. The service was quick and friendly. The \"Hot Mama\" salsa is better than the regular hot sauce found at most. Lastly, on a warm day, I enjoyed sitting out on the patio with the Lynx gliding by and people watching in South End. That is more enjoyable than overlooking a strip mall parking lot at the chain burrito places. Overall, I recommend Phat Burrito and would go here more often if I didn't live so far from South End."}
{"text":"We just moved here from California.  My husband is a native California boy and I lived in the Bay Area for seven years.  We know a good burrito when we see one.  While I doubt I will ever find anything as delicious as our beloved taco truck in Petaluma (we actually composed a song about them once), Phat Burrito is extraordinary.   Super fresh ingredients, great spice blends, yummy beans and some terrific handmade salsas set Phat Burrito apart and put it ahead of the other joints we've tried both here and in California.  Way to go, Carolina!!"}
{"text":"this is a review for my take out order.
I ordered 2 chicken tacos,2 steak tacos and 2 fish tacos.
they have a salsa bar but I guess I was not aware that they are NOT a Mexican taco place, because all the salsas they offer were like tomato based salsas for chips.
I was expecting salsas like the one you get from authentic Mexican taquerias,oh well.
alright ,both the chicken and steak tacos were okay,not bad but just ok.
however the fish tacos were great ! i like the mango salsa they put on top,it has a hint of sweet from the mango and a kick from the jalapeno! yum!!"}
{"text":"Phat burrito never fails to deliver!! The burrito is huge, service is great and place is clean. They have daily specials that are a good deal.  I love the fish tacos (Tilapia) and Mango/red cabbage slaw is off the chart!  Not a big fan of the queso but it is ok."}
{"text":"Was looking for a local fish taco joint.  This place had great food and the ambiance was perfect for a casual spot.  If I lived here it would be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out the new location, made sure to check the yelp app for their hours before venturing out too.  My friends and I walked over and we were greeted by their staff who were outside for a smoke break.  They made no effort to talk to us, just said \"we are closed\".  I said \"oh darn, even checked your hours prior to coming\" and they responded with \"you were probably looking at the other location, not us\".  We still had 40 minutes until closing time according the yelp app and their website.   

Ho hum.  Was really hankering for a burrito that evening... I may give it another shot later on, but was really bummed to find them so unfriendly especially in this neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Me and My Boyfriend love this place! We secretly asked if they had a Challenge of any sort, but they haven't made one yet. We will be waiting and Damn the burritos are huge! I am down 1/2 of the burrito and im already full. There nachos are amazing as well. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I mean the folks there are pretty cool as well as the atmosphere. I ordered a steak burrito with all the trimmings and honestly it lacked flavor. I'm used to that Mexican flavor or some sort of seasoning. I had to add a little salt to it. So it was aight. Location is dope as I was people watching with all the peoples gallivanting around the food trucks."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last ate here.  Not much has changed and that's a good thing.  Shows they're on their game if the crowds keep showing up.  I give 4 stars for vibe and attitude, but only 3 stars on food for taste and presentation (let's call it 3-ish).  I was surprised at the heft of the steak burrito, but was disappointed it was mostly rice and beans.  Where's the beef?  At $12 for a steak burrito, a bag of Tostito's, and a cup of water, I expected higher quality.  

I'm sure I'll be back and try something different.  I know there has to be a better experience than today."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish taco, it comes with the mango salsa. Which was ok for me. What I realized is I like the battered fish tacos not grilled. So I will go back and try something else. I also had the steaks soft tacos which I like a lot. Overall, staffs were friendly. A good clean place. Will do a 2nd visit and update my review."}
{"text":"This is definitely not my go-to mexican restaurant. The chips are straight out of a bag and burritos are very mediocre. Definitely better options out there."}
{"text":"Came here and got a chicken taco and a steak taco, my family got a chicken burrito and a chicken quesadilla and a side of queso with chips. Food was okay. Felt like the food needed more flavor. I'd only choose this place as a last option."}
{"text":"Our burritos were huge, stuffed, and made to order. On a sunny Sunday at lunch, we had our food within minutes, which was great. The only complaint I have is the chips for the queso- they're the cheap and gross yellow circle chips that you get at a movie theater or a carnival. I wish they had regular chips. Queso was great and the service was fantastic. We will be back!"}
{"text":"From the outside appearance I was hesitant to try this place; however, from the reviews I was encouraged to go in. Like many of the previous reviews, the portion sizes of the burrito and quesadilla were large. I ordered a veggie burrito and it was really good. The sour cream and guacamole were delicious additions. We also ordered a caramel brownie. My husband and I both ate under $15. This is a great place for lunch or non-fancy dinner. The interior was colorful and very casual. And the impressive part was when it was slow, the employees were cleaning. I appreciate a clean kitchen."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is a cool place to go to right next to Common Market.  The staff is always very friendly and the decor is perfect for this establishment.  Unfortunately, I find their food mediocre.  There just isn't a seasoning or anything special.  The queso is pretty good and has a little heat to it which I like. If you are in a rush and just want an ok burrito this is your place."}
{"text":"I've loved Phat Burrito for a big, philling (see what I did there?!) lunch for years now. I typically get a chicken burrito with the fruity salsa they put in the fish burrito with chips and queso. That cheese is heaven and really black peppery. Love it. 
They offer quesadillas and beer too. Don't forget the salsa bar in the side area. 
This past weekend my husband and I wanted to grab a bite of breakfast outside with our pup. Phat Burrito it was. They are open for breakfast until 1030, at least on Saturday. They offer smaller versions of their burrito and they are filled with meat, potatoes, eggs, veggies, you name it. There are a few to choose from and we also shared the grits and cheese with chorizo on top. Man, the flavor a were right in. A but runny to eat with a fork but still yummy. 
It's a great, fast and satisfying meal. We didn't get hungry again until about 4 pm."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is my favorite burrito in Charlotte. I really enjoy the funky decor and vibe. The salsa bar is a huge plus; I'm particularly a fan on the hot and green salsas. And, sometimes, they have a habanero salsa that's the bomb."}
{"text":"Get a tofu burrito! You won't regret it!  They have some of the best tofu I've ever tasted. Marinated and has a delicious lime flavor to it. I'm about 30 minutes away and still make a special trip for a takeout burrito.

They've got beer, King of Pops, baked items like cookies or brownies available and a tiny salsa bar. I'm a vegetarian, but I've heard awesome things about their BBQ burritos. There's a nice, little outdoor seating area and the location is perfect in South End. I always like the music they play (usually pop punk or ska reggae type stuff) This is my go-to for a fast, hearty meal.

Extra items can run your total up pretty quick, so keep an eye out. But they offer so many awesome things, it's hard to not want to devour it all! Nom Nom Nom"}
{"text":"..........Annnndddd it's closing. People are saying it's because of the parking but REALLY? So the other businesses in that area, that are still open, have the same problem? Nope. It was the food. It's cool to be hipster but be a hipster who cares about the food, how your restaurant looks, cleaning (ugh, a bummer I know), and just overall respect to customers. Dude."}
{"text":"The space needs to be pressure washed.  The cleanliness not to mention the cashier who was more consumed w/his cell phone than taking our order in addition to the portions being small for the price earned this place 1 star. The food was greasy & eating while looking at the dangerous electrical & the fans that had dirt as thick as carpet - we ate half & w/the calories saved treated ourselves to dessert.  Divey is 1 thing but health hazard quite another."}
{"text":"My boyfriend says, \"Phat Burrito is just a local Chipotle.\"

1. There is nothing wrong with that

2. It's better than that because,
 A. They have a salsa bar
 B. They also serve refried beans. I really like refried beans.
 C. Their salads come with a toasted tortilla, seriously the salads are great here
 D. They serve fish
 E. I'm sure other reasons too but this list should have sold you by now."}
{"text":"Saw so many awesome reviews, so while I was in Charlotte I had to stop because I love tacos!! I ordered a chicken taco which was ok and a steak taco which was dry. The chips and guac were good. My friend ordered a quesadilla which was dry as well. Guess it just wasnt our day for a great taco :("}
{"text":"First time at this nice local stop. Got a steak burrito. It was very large and delicious. I wish they had better chips and salsa (chips are just a bag of tostitos), but all in all a decent place. Better than chipotle in the area."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is Snoops with some red paint slapped on the walls. I look forward to giving them another chance and maybe I misordered. I loved the fresh made salsa bar (in the exact same place at Snoops former topping bar). I didn't love the BBQ steak flavor I would try just steak next time. Burritos come with protein, cheese, rice and choice of beans (red, black or refried) with upcharges for everything else (guac, sour cream). There isn't a list of toppings anywhere: lettuce, tomato, cilantro, jalapeno etc. and my mind went blank when it was time to order. They do have a kids menu and daily specials like a $6 quesadilla on Fridays. Super location  - if a tricky shared parking lot. Try to walk or bike there if possible."}
{"text":"Been a awhile but I needed a quick pit stop to fuel up. Greeted warmly upon entering. :)
They've stayed phunky over the years & today, 2 days before Christmas, they're busy too: Good!

Tacos today - 2 of 'em: One barbecue chicken upon recommendation one and one grilled tilapia. 
I'm Digging the fish w/ mango salsa. 

Salsa bar is self-serve; freshly made; several choices. 

Go!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was pretty pleased. 
I had 2 of the veggie tacos which I thought were good, they come with lettuce, tomato and cheese standard and then the veggies vary. My husband had one fish and one veggie taco and was also pretty happy. We got the chips and queso to split. The chips are pretty standard and I don't think made in house but the queso was good, different than regular. 
Only bummer is that I didn't see any draft beer, only bottles."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy recent experience. Waitress confused my addition of \"chorizo\" as \"chips and salsa\" despite multiple corrections. Ended up with no chorizo and a bag of bland tortilla chips."}
{"text":"My go to for a burrito fix. Love the options on the salsa bar also. The hot salsa is amazing"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever eaten!!!!! They don't need to be modified in any way at all. The slaw is crunchy, the fish is perfectly cooked and seasoned and the mango salsa gives it a nice touch of sweet and citrus to round out everything. 

My dining partner said the tacos were small but I felt like two tacos were plenty for lunch. A little pricey but I get it, they are paying trendy south end rents which have gone up b/c of the blue which they sit right on. 

The only fail I identified at Phat B were the tortilla chips. They were actually Tostitos in a bag. A place like this should at least man-Joan's make their own chips. how Hard is that? Especially if you are serving queso that was pretty good."}
{"text":"VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY!

Finally a burrito place in Charlotte that makes tofu burritos. Their staff is super friendly, they make the burrito as you like it and then have salsa that is great. The staff even gave me some special hot sauce that blew my mindhole. 

Highly recommend this place! And its right across from the common market!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of phat burrito since i moved here about four years ago.  the first thing i'll say is don't let the outside scare you. the funky paint and the bars on the windows are from when the southend was more run down. 
    the second would be to try the bbq chicken tacos.  i know it sounds strange, but they are very addictive. i used to call in just to make sure they had enough as they make it fresh and once they're out, they're out.  i've never really been there when the place was packed. so, the atmosphere is very laid back and if you have a business card, feel free to slide one under the glass on their tables. this place is great when checking out the shops and galleries of the south end. so, give it a try and have a few tacos on their patio."}
{"text":"Yummm!!!  This is the best place in town to go for burritos as big as your face.  The food here is pretty basic, so don't expect any crazy combinations, but the veggie burrito is the best in town (fresh sauteed portabellos, zucchini, onions, and peppers) and the quesadillas are awesome.  Very busy during lunch, but it usually isn't too difficult to get a seat."}
{"text":"Decided to go down to Phat Burrito to enjoy one of their signature burritos, about half way through my burrito I started chewing down onto a tough end of grilled chicken? Well apparently I was way off and if I kept chewing and swallowed then this plastic bag would have easily clogged my throat and most likely ended my life... Continue to eat here and risk this!!! Or join me as I eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've always liked the South End location so was expecting good things from this location that is more convenient. I was terribly mistaken. I agree with the other reviewer who said the employees lacked supervision. We left without ever getting half of our order. We tried to ask about it but couldn't seem to get the person beyond the counter to understand what we were saying. The tacos were pitiful. The chicken taco consisted of lettuce, tomato, and about ten tiny cubes of grilled chicken. I can't review the fish taco because I never got it. I've never given such a bad review, but I don't know when I've seen such poor service or disappointing food. I hope they fix the problems, but I won't be back to see whether they do."}
{"text":"Folks, this used to be a really great place with a salsa bar and attentive staff and delicious food.  It clearly changed management and now is going down like the Titanic.  It makes me very sad, because I used to frequent this place many years ago and still got excited when I had a chance to go back.  The burritos were so freakin' good!  Were!  I wish them luck and hope that they look at Yelp sometimes.  Check it before you wreck it, guys/gal."}
{"text":"Love this classic hole in the wall.. Awesome outside with great murals. Little joint feel inside. We really liked the burritos, flavor, large size. Not spicy at all, so what I'm saying is we don't like spicy so we enjoyed it, if that's a turn off for you, you should know. I enjoyed the fish taco with mango salsa. very generous size on the taco, you might need just one!"}
{"text":"I'll admit I'm a sucker for a cozy environment and friendly staff that seem to actually enjoi their job. Been eating there for years and have yet to ever be disapointed. Always plenty of food and I've never experienced anyone skimping on the fillings like some heave said. Never had a problem with parking either, it's not in some big strip mall, ya didn't catch that pulling up??"}
{"text":"This was our second trip to this location. The first trip was nothing special, followed up by another nothing special eating experience. The burrito is nice and big, however both the tofu and veggie burrito didn't seem too impressive in the flavor department. Even the hot-salsa-liquid water-like substance didn't add anything other than making it a wet, dripping burrito. Also, unfortunately on the first visit, despite the no-cheese order, cheese made its way on to my burrito. No bueno. 

i will say i thought the service was pretty friendly on this trip. 

It's close to the wife's work, so it's easy lunch, but not a go-to for us."}
{"text":"The \"tornado\" (as I'm affectionately using to reference my 11 and 13 year old nieces) \"hit\" here first!  Today is my first time to eat here!

1:05 pm and there is still a lunch crowd!  Half are about ready to leave the other half ordering and waiting!  Staff is very friendly!  The guy taking my order made sure he knew, I knew what I wanted!  One Burrito, Steak and Cilantro!  He asked, and I confirmed: No beans, No rice, No guac, No cheese, nothing but Steak, cilantro wrapped in a Tortilla, wisely wrapped in foil!  Lil' Ricky and I drove all the Burrito Bars Crazy ordering like this \"just Steak\" - \"OK what would you like\" _ Next person \"JUST Steak!\"  He got it right, the kitchen got it right - It was very good!  I had a couple of bites of my nieces Chicken Burrito with everything, just so I could tell you... It was also good.  I did not get the spicey Steak (they may call it Barbecue Steak?) mine was the plain steak!

For the volume of lunch business they are doing they are FAST!!!"}
{"text":"Eh. This place is alright. The food doesn't seem very fresh, and the restaurant itself isn't terribly clean either. 

I got the BBQ Chicken Salad, and the meat was good, but the lettuce was turning brown and was not crisp. 

My friends ordered a burrito and tacos, and they had the same consensus. 

I probably won't return, but try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! I've been up all night sick. 
The decor was cool, food was bland, the steak tasted like pot roast and the beans were sort of runny I normally am a mom and popper but in this case stick with chipotle or go to any authentic place down S.blvd. Didn't seem to clean 
I repeat up all night sick!!!!!! But enjoy if you are daring."}
{"text":"Very bohemian with awesome mexican food!!!  Burritos, tacos, whatever...it's definitely the best in town and worth the struggle for both a parking spot and a seat.  Their salsa bar is a huge win for me...love the tangy green chilli.  I've been a loyal follower for about six years now and can honestly say, this is the place is where I take anyone new or visiting Charlotte every time."}
{"text":"Great Nachos, even if there not on the menu.  Order the chicken nachos with cheese, pico and caso.  They are Great!"}
{"text":"I went to Phat Burrito and ordered the steak quesadillas.  They were delicious!!  There was plenty of steak and yummy cheese.  It came with a side of sour cream and there is a little salsa bar near the food window where I filled up on fresh pico de gallo.  I was seriously in heaven.  My friend ordered the BBQ Chicken burrito and let me tell you kids, it was indeed a PHAT burrito.  Not only did it taste good but it was huge!  The burrito is stuffed with your choice of refried or black beans.  I sampled a bite of hers (with the black beans) and I was in love.  My only disappointment was the guacamole.  It was mediocre and the only ingredient I could really taste was lime.  The chips that came with it were great but for some they may be too salty.  Instead of eating the guac, I marched back up to the salsa bar and experimented with a variety of salsas.  It was pretty fun!  

The atmosphere is very casual.  It has a funky, laidback, almost carribbean feel.  The staff greeted me when I walked in and took my order right away.  I decided to order a beer with my quesadilla (another added bonus) but I had to use the restroom before we sat down.  As soon as I came out, the cashier called my name and had my beer opened and waiting.  Good service!

My meal costs around $9 with the beer and I was fully satisfied.  I will definitely go back and would consider swinging by for pick up!"}
{"text":"A friend raved about this place on my last trip to Charlotte.  We stopped in for a late lunch on NYE. Now that the scene is set, onto the review...

I'm just going to say it... it's a hipster burrito restaurant. The food was fine. Nothing to call my mama about, nothing I wouldn't eat again, but just fine.  I've eaten at several of these burrito places lately and they're all just kinda the same to me as far as taste and quality.  Everything seemed fresh, the salsa was unique, the seating adequate.

If I lived in the area, I'd probably stop in on occasion. It's definitely better and healthier than the chains."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, and both times the burritos were just... bland, really. I mean, they literally tasted like NOTHING, as if they were filled with Styrofoam. It tastes like what I'd imagine hospital burritos would taste like. I really WANT to like this place, but it's kind of hard when Taco Bell runs circles around you in the spice department!"}
{"text":"Small Price, Phat Burrito

 Learning the streets in and around uptown Charlotte I finally got the nerve to go and eat at a restaurant I passed almost every day on the way to school. The old Aztec looking building on Camden Road sure has caught my eye more than once. In a place where skateboarders do their thing, paper is blowing on the ground, and a two lane road without a car in sight makes me wonder why anyone would eat here.

Pulling into a parking lot of no more than six spaces with everyone of them being occupied made me rethink that this trip could be one I'd remember. Parking on the street was no big deal assuming you live uptown and you do it every day anyways. When I walked through the door a screen of fog and heat hit me in the face like when your girlfriend slaps you because you changed her reality TV show to Sports Center. 

The craving for something in my tummy grew faster and faster as I was deciding what to eat. The BBQ Steak Burrito with a side of Chips and Salsa. Never in my mind would I have thought to put BBQ and Mexican together until I tried it. Playing on words, this burrito brought me joy of an unheard of quantity. The burrito was as life-size as my head and it was gone in minutes.
                      
$7.95 to fill me up is abnormal. When I am hungry, I eat and man can I eat. I had to flex my stomach muscles just to get is all down. Being a college student this is definitely quality food for a cheap price."}
{"text":"The food is good but I was having dinner with some friends out and them turn the lights off 30 minutes before it closes. I think that was rude."}
{"text":"Three words: BBQ Chicken burrito.  This bad boy is a monster packed with flavor.  I always rate my burrito experience as compared to Chipotle.  This is  the baseline to which everyone can understand.  Their prices are marginally higher than Chipotle, but their burritos are slightly bigger as well.  They had wheat tortillas which I think is a plus.  Their salsa bar had a bunch of different options, but it wasn't fully stocked.  It could have used a little service.  
 
I ordered a beer to keep me company, but I was turned off by the fact that it was served just colder than lukewarm.  That was disappointing.  I also noticed that their back half of the restaurant was closed for seating as one of the employees was cleaning up.  This forced me into sitting right by the front door, which would have been real frustrating had it been busier.  They have tacos, quesadillas, and vegetarian options as well.  Phat burrito was a welcome surprise when I took a stab in the dark at a local joint in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best burrito in town. None of the big chains compare to the freshly grilled chicken and steak, toasted (not steamed) tortillas and moist, sticky (not dry) rice. Everything about the flavors are perfect.

Fresh salsas, made on-site are the finishing touch. 

I've been eating at Phat Burrito almost every week since they opened, years ago. Consistently better than all the other chains.

We are so lucky to have this landmark right here in Southend."}
{"text":"I've been a phat burrito customer since the restaurant first opened. It was incredible the management was really great, and the staff were awesome. Today when I went, things have changed. The self-serve salsa bar is gone. You have to request small cups of salsa from behind the counter. The size of the quesadillas and burritos have shrunk, nothing was pH a T. When you're paying a premium, you expect quality, quantity, and easy access to condiments, in this case salsas. What happened? Can you put it back the way it was?"}
{"text":"What can I say?  Mexican food is my weakness.  I have walked by this place about 100 times but never at the right time for a meal.

The other day it was around dinner so we stopped in, it's not fancy and the menu is written on a chalkboard.  I decided on a chicken taco salad and my better? half decided on a chicken burrito.  I LOVED that guacamole and sour cream didn't cost extra cause avocados are another weakness of mine.  The salad was delicious.  Lettuce was fresh, chicken was good and plentiful, cheese, and all other toppings were good.  It didn't come in one of the those pre fried taco bowls either, instead just with a tortilla they crisped up right before serving it.

There's a little bar of different flavors of salsa, I only tried the mildest one cause I'm a baby but they all looked fresh and homemade.  This will definitely be in the repetoire of places to walk to for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit and it's just okay to me... I'm just not sure what all the fuss is about here because there is a chipotle right down the street that will give you better taste and more bang for your buck.  I guess this place is more about tradition and being local, but in my experience being local doesn't automatically make you better.  I had the steak and tilapia tacos which were okay but kind of bland when it came down to it.  I also ordered chips and quac... The guac was good but the chips came in a bag which reminded me of gas station nachos ( I was thinking, \"Are you kidding me for $4\").  I don't know... maybe there is something they have thats very good but I won't be going back to find out.  Just like Southend in general, this place is very overrated!"}
{"text":"Best burrito in the city. Great staff, friendly and accommodating. Perfect participant among the thriving establishments of SouthEnd."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito, we can still be friends...

PB I really wanted to like you. Hell I wanted to love you to the deepest depths of my soul. However it isn't going to happen. I mean you have a bunch of great things going for you...your close to home, you got a cool name, you are cheap & easy and of course you have chosen the greatest food on the planet to make, Mexican. However you are like a hot chick...you don't notice the flaws until you are up close. That is when you see the wrinkles or botox injection marks. 

The bars on the windows add a ghetto charm, the hippies behind the counter are cool slackers but all your salsa's taste the same, your corn chips aren't homemade but tostitios and (GASP!) your Coke was flat! There are certain things I can overlook but flat Coke is not one of them. 

I have stopped by a few times so this isn't a vindictive thing. It isn't you it is me........ ;("}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for a breakfast burrito. I'd been here a few times for lunch but was craving a breakfast burrito and realized I was close by.

Unfortunately it was a disappointment - perhaps I've been spoiled by breakfast options in San Diego, but this was not great. The tortilla was too thick and chewy, the eggs tasteless, potatoes average, and the only flavor was chorizo. Worse, the salsa bar wasn't available so it was very dry.

On a related note the coffee was sub-par, really unacceptable given the great coffee available in CLT.

Phat burrito, I'm sorry but you let me down."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall burrito joint shows up any Moe's, Chipotle, etc. (and believe me, I love all of these places). Do not judge this book by its cover. You will not forget these big-as-your-face burritos, packed with fresh ingredients. I will be returning for one of these the next time I'm fortunate enough to visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Here, I'll save you the time and trouble. Go to Qdoba or Chipotle for a better burrito. At very least, their employees will kindly take your order and pack a burrito with quality ingredients.

Although the decor in this place is fun, I can't say the same for my time spent eating this burrito. Rice is over-cooked and is more similar to mashed potatoes, my first bite was nothing but a soggy mess of rice. The chicken is dry, un-seasoned, and lacked any flavor whatsoever. I had to cover my burrito in salsa (which is the only half decent item here) in order to actually find some flavor and not be completely upset about the $10 I just spent. The guacamole was being made as I walked, it was fresh - but just your run of the mill guacamole, nothing to look at here folks. 

I'd also like to add that a couple employees seemed to hate their job and didn't really want to take my order. Another guy was much friendlier to the patrons behind me. I should have told them to turn back.

If you are into flour tortillas stuffed with flavorless ingredients, mushy rice, dry meat and prepared by just as bland employees - - this is the place to be!

I'll review their sweet tea separately. I'd give it four stars. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"I wondered into this place on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and fell in love. I ordered the veggie taco topped with guacamole and it was phenomenal!  The prices are very reasonable and I love the laid back atmosphere with the cool music. If you want to sit outdoors they have a beautiful patio where you can sit outside!"}
{"text":"Best pico da gallo  in town!! Very fresh burritos! Friendly staff, good atmosphere. Large amount of food for the price! Much better than Moe's and Chipotle."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is a great little place.  The burritos are extra large, reasonably priced, and unique.  The seating is ample, with an outdoor patio for nice nights.  There is even a parking lot!  Extra perks include Coke products (fountain) and a salsa bar.  Finally, the staff couldn't be friendlier.  We'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is an awesome burrito joint on the Camden Road hipster corridor of South End. Definitely try the burritos and quesadillas. I typically get a chicken burrito, which is packed with shredded chicken, black beans, rice, guac and sour cream. 

The food is cheap and filling. As for all the reviews that claim this isn't authentic mexican...duh. Phat Burrito never claimed to be authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for real Mexican food, head east on Central Avenue to La Unica or Casa de Las Enchiladas."}
{"text":"Absolutely, the BEST veggie burrito known to man! I'm a lover of Qdoba (Chipotle and Moe's don't even compare in my book) but Phat Burrito puts them to shame. What's even more amazing is that the burritos travel well. No soggy mess when you get home. The ingredients taste really fresh, are full of flavor and who doesn't love the fact that the place is yellow? Definitely a local fave."}
{"text":"Phat burrito is a staple in SouthEnd. They have incredible hours! After drinking at local breweries, walk to Phat Burrito for the best queso in town and other late night sinful noshes. Early morning heading to work or awful hangover? Walk to Phat Burrito for the Ranchero burrito, with chorizo, and Enderly coffee. Whatever the reason or time of day, a visit to Phat Burrito is always the right choice."}
{"text":"Cashier was very friendly. The food tasted fresh. I had the BBQ Steak burrito (great choice) The bbq chicken and steak was the same price so I chose the beef, of course! The burrito size was similar to a Chipotle burrito. Burrito a little dry, but they provide unlimited salsa...Worth every cent to me!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and had a steak burrito with queso. The queso was awesome, but the burrito was good - not great. I prefer building my own burrito at a Chipotle, but the queso and the salsa bar make this place a legitimate alternative. 

Not bad, but also not enough for me to crown them king of the burrito places."}
{"text":"I said a happy hello to this joint today for lunch and look forward to going back real soon!  It's in the heart of southend with loud colors painting the exterior and an alternative atmosphere when you walk in.  I ordered a spinach quesadilla & the guy gladly said I could add black beans which I was happy about.  It was the size of a medium pie full of flavor.  Spinach was fresh and the ingredients were not like I have ever tasted in a quesadilla before but worked fantastic!!  Pricing is a little higher then most places of that sort but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and had the BBQ steak burrito. I ordered guac and queso on it which was extra and I'm completely cool with that but I ate half the burrito and couldn't see or taste any guac or queso so I went to the counter and asked the girl who made it if she put it on and she said yea and that I was in queso heaven with how much she put on. I go back unfold the entire burrito and definitely didn't see any queso. I couldn't even finish it because it was so dry and bland. Not impressed at all. Sub par burrito and if I'm paying $10 for a burrito I'd like to get the guac and queso that I paid for that was extra. I didn't bother saying anything else because they were so busy but I definitely wouldn't recommend this place and I won't be going back. The steak queso burrito at qdoba is 10 times better. And you actually see queso oozing from your burrito there you don't have to open it up and search for it. This place is incredibly overrated. I think people just think it's cool and give it the benefit of the doubt but in my book if your food isn't good then I don't care how cool your restaurant looks. I could have made a better burrito at home and saved $10. What a waste. Big thumbs down."}
{"text":"The bbq chicken burrito is hands down one of the best burritos in town! They have a salsa bar too with several varieties."}
{"text":"Great alternative to my usual burrito stops. Fun stop to take in the SouthEnd scene. The BBQ chicken burrito is my go-to. I would stick with the tacos or burritos as the quesadillas are a bit boring. Chips and queso are very reasonably priced, but the chips are just a bag of Tostitos. 

Be prepared for a long line any time of day for the next year as all the surrounding construction crews pack this place. 

Nice outdoor seating nestled between the light rail and Camden road."}
{"text":"Really cool little spot. Perfect for a quick and tasty bite. They have a really divey feel to them which is always a win in my book and the service is always friendly and fast. There literally always seems to be a long line but don't let that scare you off they take your order before you even get to the register and move with what seems like lightening speed considering all the food they are making. There's a self service salsa bar tomatillo salsa is normally my favorite but I actually didn't really like it here however the pico and the hot are delicious. Disappointed in the bagged chips they serve I think fresh made would really make a huge difference."}
{"text":"Not impressed. They messed up my order and had awful customer service(called to order ahead and they left me on hold then hung up on me, sadness).  My burrito was bland, and the fact that I paid extra for guacamole AND sour cream and received neither really grinds my gears. I'm sure I would've enjoyed my food much more had they not forgotten those key ingredients. That, and they messed up the two other items in my order as well.... , but I digress. I'm pretty sure they were upset about food truck Fridays knocking them out the park I'm going to give them another try, since I have always heard good things about the place, & I do so badly want to love them based solely on the name."}
{"text":"I really hate this place.  I live across the street, so I give this business way more of my money than they deserve.  Pretty  overpriced.  $18 for a burrito and quesadilla.  The service is slow, they rarely answer the phone when you call.  I think it's more of an issue of only having one person running the register and grill at the same time.

But the food they make is pretty good.  The service is awful, but I do keep coming back.  Salsa is awesome."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is one of those hole in the wall Gems! Located in the Southend of Charlotte NC across from the food truck Friday lot. When it comes to craving a quick, fresh, and fairly cheap burrito you're thinking Phat Burrito. Show some local love."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy burritos! I've done Phat Burrito mostly for lunch. One of the offices where I used to work would make it into a Friday lunch trip out now and then. The lines were always long, but we were on the clock, so the lines were kind of nice.

I love, love, love the salsa bar. The hot stuff is really hot, so watch out for it if you're a wuss. It's fun being able to determine for yourself if you've got enough salsa or not...I hate when Mexican places dole it out to you. End the salsa tyranny!

My favorite dish is the vegetarian quesadilla. It's loaded with stuff, and the vegetables are nicely cooked before they go into the quesadilla. There's some kind of juice that drips out, which is exciting because then you can sop it up with the outside of the tortilla. I have a whole technique...I should upload a video. Can we do that here?"}
{"text":"The service was awesome and the burrito is huge; however it was very poorly seasoned. More so, my order was completely wrong...asked for refried beans got black beans, asked for pico didn't get any, asked for guac didn't get any. It was my first experience with Phat Burrito and it was not a good one."}
{"text":"Yelp to the rescue.  Was on the way to the airport and had some time to kill....and needed some good grub.  Found this gem and glad I did.  How yummy and legit.  The finer points:

- No nachos on the menu (perhaps they'll make 'em if you ask...which I didn't).  I think nachos are the finest, most perfect food groupe on God's green earth
- Salsa bar!  And it's so, so, so yummy (careful with the \"spicy\"...bc it's actually spicy)
- Fish tacos use tilapia...which they break up - I think they should leave it whole
- So the BBQ steak -- it's YUM, actually BBQ flavor which is brilliant with the other flavors. 

Nice people and cool atmosphere.  WINNING."}
{"text":"So I ordered a black bean veggie burrito, chips, and a drink and paid extra for a side of sour cream.  I was told sour cream was on the burrito.  It was not.  Service was slow, it was lunch, and the table I sat at had not be bused.  The burrito and ingredients and cheese tasted great, but there was a lack of any veggies except for a couple of table spoons of sautéed veggies.  When I am paying $11.00 for a burrito combo I expect more.  Am I paying extra for the hipster atmosphere here? I can get a much better burrito at any of the mexican restaurants around.  Parking sucks here."}
{"text":"I love this place! We always come for Lunch and it's always packed, I enjoy the fish burrtio, but I'm not the biggest fan of fish, but I like it here bc it has pineapples and other things so I don't get the fish taste.. I also like  the self serve salsas. The service is always fast and I love to sit outside on a nice hot day to enjoy my phat burrito!!"}
{"text":"Good different place. Overpriced and yeah they have BBQ steak and chicken burritos but they aren't that special. The BBQ steak one is sweet like too sweet for BBQ but its spicy which is the only good thing. The BBQ chicken isn't sweet it's just Spicy and taste like good BBQ. The queso is really good best I've ever had and thank God for that cause I couldn't finish my BBQ steak burrito cause it was way too sweet. Also the guacamole was brown, disgusting and just looked like they threw it in the container, the chips are toastitos chips like the brand name so nothing special. Overall it's an okay place, I was excited to go because it looked different but eh...not in a rush to go again. I'd go to chipotle or Qdobas before next time."}
{"text":"What's going on with Phat?  New ownership?  This place used to have the best burritos in town - not anymore.  I literally used to come here every week; I loved the place.  However, the last 5 or 6 times, the burritos have gotten progressively worse.  The last burrito I got was almost inedible.  And the queso has been awful... did they change the recipe or is someone in the kitchen messing it up?  Sad to see what this South End staple has become.  Today was my last meal there."}
{"text":"Awesome quesadillas. Been coming since the 90s. Still best burritos and quesadillas in town. Nomnom"}
{"text":"This place use to be the shizzzzzzz but I just ordered a naked burrito and I got 2 tinyyyyy pieces of chicken and and a tablespoon of beans, salsa, and like 4 pieces of lettuce..... needless to say I got about 1/5 of what you would get at chipotle. No lie. and I'm a small girl. I left there really hungry still. Actually I heated up a frozen burrito when I got home. and I feel bad about this review because this use to be my favorite place to eat. But I think the obvious \"changes\" is really really dumb for the business because I promise that you guys are loosing customers as we speak and I hope you realize it before it's too late."}
{"text":"Huge burritos at this joint, they have plenty of vegetarian options as well.  The naked chicken and rice burrito was delicious and it had an organic flavor.  The graffiti outside the place reminds me of that soulful Philly graffiti that I love.  This little corner restaurant is fun, go out on the patio and enjoy a burrito."}
{"text":"Fast fun neighborhood food. Great location near the light rail line makes this a great place to stop at on the way to uptown while riding the line."}
{"text":"When I lived in Brooklyn near Court St. there was this little spot that sold the best burritos this side of heaven. 

I've been to several restaurants in my 8 years here in Charlotte looking for a burrito that would bring me close to that Brooklyn hole in the wall. 

Finally after snubbing my nose to this place for years I gave them a try and I was not disappointed! The best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"These white boys can make some banging burritos! I'll be back this Saturday for lunch. A must go while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A Negra Modelo, a giant steak burrito, a lovely patio, and I rolled out feeling like a python that had swallowed a goat.  All win, and for only $11."}
{"text":"Went for a casual business lunch and had the BBQ chicken taco as well as the fish taco....both incredible!  Fast, fresh, and fun!  Will be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"I lived in South End for an embarrassingly long time before I ate at Phat Burrito, but now, I can't stay away. It's far too easy to hop off the light rail and swing by for dinner on my way home. 

I've probably had a quesadilla here once or twice, but mostly, I go for the burritos. They are giant, and filling without being overwhelming. If you're in the mood for dessert, I can personally attest to those brownies being well worth the $1.25 or whatever they cost. I'm not sure if they make them in-house but I've debated going to PB for the brownies alone.

Unfortunately, in the Noms At Night category, I'm going to have to give them a solid C. Closing at 9 does not match up with my dinnertime. I understand that small businesses can't always run the hours that larger chains do, and I won't take off a star for it, but they would get so much more of my money if they were open even just an hour later. 

Here's a tip, folks: if you're going to use their parking lot, be careful, especially at night. During my burrito stop a few nights ago, I walked out to view the aftermath of a pickup truck VS Volvo backing-up accident. I'll let you guess which car won. Maybe park across the street?"}
{"text":"Hanging in Charlotte for the weekend and this was the first place we ate.  Well...ain't we lucky?!  We ordered a BBQ chicken burrito and a steak burrito.  Both were great.  Fun atmosphere and quirky hipster crowd.  We ate there on a warm spring night when the food trucks were across the way and had smiles all around.

Pre-conceived ideal burrito folk:  This place is not Chipotle.  Not worse or better...just a totally different meal and (especially) experience.  Enjoy a phatty burrito and spend your money locally."}
{"text":"I had the fish taco. It was good. Next time I will ask
For extra mango salsa. I didn't realize it even had any on it til the last 2 bites."}
{"text":"Listen, this place has mediocre burritos and \"okay\" mexican food.

How did this place get such a high rating and how has it been voted as \"best Mexican in Charlotte\"...I SURE DON'T KNOW.  

Honestly great food.  But I don't feel it qualifies for authentic Mexican in the least.  Mexican food is one of my few passions and I can whip up a better burrito than PHAT Burrito in about 5 minutes in my own kitchen.  Some spices would have been nice.  The salsa that they have is very good and if you asked them to put it inside the burrito you might have a pretty close match to something halfway tasty.  

But quite honestly, it tasted like something from a college campus.  Yuck."}
{"text":"I really like this place for a quick, delicious, and yes, PHAT burrito. They are extremely large, which is great when you're famished, and the quality and price are right. I've also always found the people who work here to be nice and helpful and everything also seems fresh and clean, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Nifty little hipster burrito joint. Food is decent, service is mediocre. Don't expect anyone to be too friendly or accommodating. Burritos are large, steak could use a little more seasoning. Apparently there is a salsa bar, but it's well hidden. I guess in a rush, with not too many options around, it would do the trick. But it wasn't really worth the hunt."}
{"text":"Love this place. Inexpensive, hearty and generous meal. I had fish burrito and fish tacos at different occasions. I think this is my favorite place to enjoy good Mexican food for less. It's well located and in a very nice hood.

If I am in Charlotte and close this hood, I definitely go here and eat. The staff is friendly. They outside seating which is great in a good weather. This place is close to a train station that makes it easy connection to the downtown area. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"On the light rail tracks half way between Bland and East/West stations, Phat Burrito is a small cinder block building that doesn't look like much from the outside. Inside is where it counts and actually, the inside is quite the eclectic collection of furniture and decoration as well. A menu of burritos and tacos and such is mounted clearly and there's a soda fountain ready to go, plus a few bottled beers available.

I opted for the barbecue chicken burrito and when my name was called, a very large burrito double wrapped in foil was on a tray ready for me. Inside, a very tasty filling of chicken and sour cream and rice and beans and guacamole. The only improvement I can offer is that it would have been nice if it was a bit better mixed up. I ended up with the last five bites being all rice and burrito shell.

They do have a small parking lot and there is metered parking nearby."}
{"text":"I was walking around Romare Bearden park and decided to take the 20 minute walk to this place for some good Mexican food.  I hadn't been here before and decided to give it a shot.  I ordered the tofu quesadilla and some chips and salsa; the quesadilla was delicious but I'm REALLY disappointed that they served bagged tortilla chips.  WEAK.  The salsa was at least flavorful so that made up for it a bit, but you guys need to do away with the bagged chips and make them homemade."}
{"text":"A real hole in the wall place but that adds to the charm. BBQ burrito is amazing and the service is always great. There is no better place for Mexican in charlotte"}
{"text":"Nommmm! The burritos here are huge! Not a big selection of add-ons but the ingredients they do have are pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Phat Burrito's burritos are just that: Phat. And, depending on how you order them, they're Fat too. And really, there's no reason to order anything else. 

Choose from BBQ Chicken, Steak, Chicken, Fish and Grilled Veggies (the girlfriend's pick every time). Surprisingly, the fish is excellent--and at a really good value. It's like a blackened Tilapia and comes with a pineapple-y salsa. Extremely tasty. Everything else is good as well--and you can add beans (black, spicy red or refried) for no additional cost. Go with the spicy red; you won't be disappointed. The guacamole isnt anything special, but it's fresh and tasty, so throw that on your burrito as well. 

Grab a Modelo as your cerveza and you're all set to enjoy the funky decor of the spare inside. Outside seating is perfect for a warm evening, and there's often a mellow hipster crowd out there enjoying itself. 

Life is Phat."}
{"text":"The place had a very funky.  I had the steak burrito that was just okay I have had better. It was alil dry and had no seasoning on it. 
No sure if i would go back"}
{"text":"I don't understand how people can eat at a place like Qdoba or Chipotle after eating at Phat.  Everything is just so much more fresh and made in house.  

The price is still very low for the food here too.  There is a nice patio to eat outside and a small amount of parking.

One thing that tends to throw people off is you have to order everything you want inside the burrito and there isn't an easy list of things to see and review.  Also, if you like a little spice make sure to ask for \"Slap\" sauce which is home made and really turns it up a notch."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito, you have my heart! We have been talking about coming here since forever and we finally ventured out tonight in the cold to try it out! The menu is simple, but delicious. They have burritos, tacos, salads, and quesadillas, each on offered with the same fillings (beans, chicken, steak, veggie, fish). My favorite part was that they had BBQ chicken or steak, I mean you can never go wrong with anything BBQ flavor! 

I got the BBQ chicken burrito with sour cream and guacamole....I'm already ready for a second round! It was sooo good, the BBQ chicken gave it a sweet kick that went so well with the rice and cheese. I passed on the beans, not my favorite ingredient to put in burritos. My boyfriend got the BBQ steaks salad which he said was also really good. Your typical taco salad except for the \"shell.\" It looked like it was a toasted flour wrap which was a smart idea. He ate some of the salad that wasn't completely in the shell and then the leftovers he folded into the shell and ate it like a taco- he got a two in one meal! Yum! 

There was a salsa bar, all of the salsas were good. I stayed away from the super hot one, but the rest were great! I can't wait to go back and try more, especially the BBQ chicken quesadilla and the queso!"}
{"text":"Wow... I reviewed this place 5 years ago... But the great thing is that Phat Burrito still deserves its 5 stars (and some).  Now that I live, literally, next door to it, I could not be happier since I don't have a 30min drive to get my burrito fix.  But for those of you that don't live next door, it's worth a trip.

In southend, parking is becoming a rarity with all the apartment buildings shooting up everywhere, but Phat Burrito has its own little parking lot.  They made the most of the small lot and can fit about 8 cars depending on their sizes.  There is also street parking too.  The best thing is that you can also take the light rail!  It's located on the Bland Street Station stop so park at the park and ride and have a leisurely Lynx ride to burrito haven.

Once you walk in, your senses are inundated with quickly action figures in the window, the hard-working and welcoming staff, and the exciting smells of the food that is put out here.  Walk up to the counter and order from an array of choices: burritos, quesadillas, tortilla salads, and soft tacos.  Sides: beans, rice, spinach, chips, quest, guac, and sometimes they have soup.  Don't forget the salsa bar around the order counter!!!!

You really can't go wrong with any choice here.  They also wrap their burritos in a way that you can take the top half wrapper off and leave the bottom to help hold all the goodness in your hands.

Beers and soft drinks are here... And there is also a King of Pops cooler if you want to get something sweet after enjoying your meal."}
{"text":"I finally made it to phat burrito!! I have been dying to try this place out. My rating is more of a 3.5 star. 
Some things you should know, extremely nice lady who takes your order. 
Most burrito and quesadillas are around $7-8. 
Tacos are super cheap, around $3...but they only give you ONE. So it will not be enough if you are trying to have a meal. I recommend the taco with mango sauce!!! Chunks of mangos in it, to die for and super refreshing!!
My tofu burrito was definitely different, the tofu did not even taste like tofu. The lady who took my order was not lying when she said the tofu are well seasoned! She even packed in grilled veggie and lettuce, tomato and cucumber in there for me! Well hello, definitely get the tofu over veggie since it's the same price but you can have extra!
This place even has a salsa bar, which I uploaded a picture of, check it out! They got your salsa from mild to extremely hot.
The outdoor seating is nicer than the inside of the restaurant, in my opinion. The umbrellas outdoor can be adjusted!!
The only complaint I have about this place is I am not sure if the sanitation could be a tad better? Well I guess I am particularly speaking about the bathroom. The female barbie is the girls bathroom and the male barbie is guys, I did not know this until I was looking really hard for the sign for women and men haha which does not exist. The bathroom inside I guess is a bit old, the faucet doesnt have much water coming out and the turn knobs are a bit weird and loose. There is also some hair on the sink...
Anyway, the food is pretty good, I'd say like 4/5. 
Come give them a try!"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ chicken burrito, and it was surprisingly good.  The BBQ sauce goes really well with the chicken, and the chicken is cooked with a nice char on the edges.

I tried some of my friend's steak burrito, and they also make the steak really well - it's almost like pulled meat - fall-off-the-bone tender.  

I'm imagining that the BBQ steak burrito would be a home run for me.  I want that next.

Portion size is HUGE, which somewhat justifies its pricey menu.  And the salsa bar has a great selection with some serious flavor.

Good option for something quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Since Phat Burrito isn't too far from campus I've been here a few times. I've tried the steak, chicken and fish burritos there. While I like the area that it's in on Camden and since I frequent BlackSheep a lot, I can't say that I love it. 

The location is really cool and it's not a bad hang out spot if you want to sit outside. It's actually preferable to sit outside, since it's either super crowded or just rather uncomfortable. 

The food wasn't bad. I'm not an especially picky person, but it's not something that I would be very openly recommend. I just wasn't blown away. It was also a bit pricey for what it was, in my opinion. For a little less you could get a comparable burrito at Chipotle or Moe's

I wouldn't rule out coming by again. My experiences weren't bad, but I do hope that it gets better."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  New favorite quick-Mexican food place in Southend for sure! It's got a cool hippy-esque vibe and bangin' food.  The crew were wearing mostly tie-dye and shades and the music was funky. Quick service, huge portions and delicious quesadillas. I got the chicken quesadilla and my date got the cheese and, let me tell you, they do NOT skimp on the cheese.  I'm dying to try the BBQ Chicken quesadilla! Next time Phat Burrito..next time. But let me elaborate on the cheese a little:  Stringy, gooey goodness in every bite -- ask for extra napkins. If you know what I mean...  I'll definitely be back. Next time I'll probably eat there to enjoy the laid-back ambiance and local artwork on the walls. You've won me over Phat Burrito!"}
{"text":"Phat Burrito doesn't look like much from the outside, just a rundown, brightly colored cinder block building. But this place has some of the best burritos in Charlotte.

These burritos are not only massive, but filled with fresh ingredients you can't get at the franchise burrito joints. There are several options of burritos, but their menu isn't that extensive. Don't go here looking for a Mexican restaurant, go here only if you want burritos or quesadillas. From black to pinto, chicken to beef to fish, & several other options, Phat Burrito provides enough of an option for the whole group to enjoy the kind of burrito each person likes. The salsa bar also has some different options to top your burrito with, & you can try as many as you wish.

This place is pretty tiny, with not much room for indoor eating. When the weather is nice, the patio is a good option & is right next to the light rail. The lunch crowd is always huge & most people take their food as takeout, so expect to wait a good while to order, & wait for seating as well if you plan to stay. The parking lot can sometimes be a hassle as well.

Phat Burrito is so much better than your normal Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. types. Phat Burrito gives you a much better tasting burrito, without a high price, & will have you going back again & again to this unique little joint."}
{"text":"I've never had the burritos but what a great spot for a couple tacos. I stroll over from a neighboring residential building weekly for a fish taco and/or one of the others on the menu. It is quick and delicious. 

As for the parking people mention, I walk, but there is the small lot connected to the building, a lot across the street with plenty of space (I think it is shared with Common Market) and plenty of street parking within a block or two in either direction. You can even park in the South BLVD street spots and walk across the light rail tracks and be here in no time."}
{"text":"We love it!  Great bang for your buck and tastes better than the chain stores around town."}
{"text":"I do not understand how people give this anything more than 3 stars.  It is awful.  there is no flavor to any of the ingredients.  It is as if you boiled rice, cooked chicken, and bought a flour tortilla from wal mart and call it Phat burrito. Their website offers franchising opportunities..are you kidding me?... there is no process, flavor, or recipe to franchise.... any place boil rice and chop lettuce and wrap it in a flour tortilla and call it a good burrtio... please do not for one second think that this place has anything on moes, chipotle, qdoba, vida, or taco bell.... I am dumbfounded at people who can rate this at 5-stars, it makes no sense to me at all.  Oh the somewhat talked about queso?!! .. let me just say that I held it upside down for an extended period of time and nothing got on the floor, it essentially broke the horribly stale awful chips as you tried to dip it.  I had half the burrito 5 chips and gave the rest to the dog (true story), and felt bad letting him eat it."}
{"text":"Normally I try a local restaurant than a chain restaurant which serve similar food. My friend wanted to go Chipotle as he was not sure abt the food at this place but I stick to \"Phat Burrito\" after reading the good reviews. Glad I did. I ordered Fish burrito and Steak taco. I asked for everything in my burrito and oh boy it was the best fish burrito I had so far. I hate smelly fish burrito but this fish has no smell and had a very unique taste. Steak taco was ok and can be skipped.

Bottom line: I will return for my Fish burrito, if I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went a month or two ago. 

1. It's way out of our way but we went because we love burritos, we were in the neighborhood, and the place has some pretty good reviews here on Yelp.

2. I got a chicken burrito and she had a bean or veggie burrito. The burritos were good but not fantastic. (Maybe it's why I forgot to Yelp about it until now...)

3. Neighborhood parking was hit or miss. I drove around the block a few times before we spied a space in the lot near the outdoor seating area. The parking lot is fairly small and maneuvering in it gave me the jitters. 

4. The place didn't appear to be the cleanest. We had to wipe our table and seats before sitting. Several tables had trash and food strewn on them..."}
{"text":"The building is funky and I loved the blue and yellow color scheme. The person who took our order was super friendly. Since this was our first visit and there was no line we did the usual staring at the menu saying \"uhhhhh\" while he patiently waited for us to make our choices. We both got the chicken burrito and I added guac to mine and the man ordered chips and queso. 
 
The wait for the burritos was a little long considering we came at an off time and the restaurant was empty. No problem, that gave me plenty of time to check out the salsa bar. I loaded up on a few flavors to try. When we received our order the burritos were a medium size and the chips that came with our queso were in a sealed plastic bag. I don't think I have ever had bagged chips before and there weren't that many considering we were splitting the queso and I had hopes of going crazy sampling the salsas. The queso was yummy and I ended up dipping my burrito in it when we ran out of chips. 

The real let down unfortunately was the burrito, which was pretty bland. Mexican food doesn't have to be spicy to be well seasoned and I felt there was no seasoning on the meat, beans or rice in the burrito. They do get points for the generosity of cheese and guac! 

I would go again but I would definitely try something other than the chicken burrito."}
{"text":"This place used to awesome!! Just not feeling it now. They took away condiment station and now you have to ask. Condiments are in the small solo containers and it's never enough...for me anyway. New employees as well that just don't seem to give a damn. Is this place under new ownership? That might be it....hmmm???"}
{"text":"I assumed that the BBQ chicken would be some sort of grilled chicken, not just chicken with BBQ sauce (at $1 extra!!!) that sadly just does not taste good in a burrito. 

I am disappoint."}
{"text":"Ive been to Phat Burrito several times now and I guess each time I just hope I was wrong the last...or maybe I just forget how unimpressed I am.  

The venue itself is in a great location (yay Southend!). The place itself is very low-key artsy/boho-esque...basically just what you should expect of Southend. 

The service is where things start going downhill slightly- It's never been good. The staff aren't friendly neighborhood joint workers (unlike CM across the street)- in fact they don't really even answer their phones with polite faux-enthusiasm. Ive paid extra for Guacamole - and never received it...when I politely told them this I wasn't even offered an apology-or even some free Guac the next time. Oh well.  All of this I could let go if they had kick-butt Southwestern fare but I am sorry to say they do not. 

The salsa's and Guacamole (sadly) are very bland. I worry about the freshness factor since they are basically left out all day (salsa's only). I ordered some Quesadillas- what no sour cream, lettuce, tomato, salsa, anything?! What is southwestern and/or mexican food without all the scrumptious sides? 

 I still haven't found a good take out Mexican with take-out prices...."}
{"text":"Cool place in Charlotte's Southside (in my gangsta voice). Went in and they were playing Prince so they had me at hello! Was really interested in trying the bbq burrito so that's I did. Interesting mix of flavors there...burrito was HUGE so I had to save some for later. Had plenty of parking across the street. Was a little disappointed in the salsa bar...looked like it needed to be refreshed a little so I passed on that. Overall it was ok...I'd go back again but it's not on my crave list."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I lived in Los Angeles for 10 years and I know MEXICAN food. This place should be ashamed to call itself \"Phat Burrito\". We ordered 4 Chicken Phat Burritos for the office. Everyone had the same reaction...BLAND BLAND BLAND. This rice was so sticky and tasteless that you could use it for wallpaper glue.The sauces were bland and marginal at best. I may have to re-think going to Chipotle, even though I am not a huge fan!! VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives in DC and comes down to visit and the first place he hits is Phat Burrito.  I think he dreams of this place in his sleep.  And he was a former Chipotle lover.  I would never turn down Phat Burrito, but it's not the world's best burrito. But, since that's not in Charlotte, I'm going to say this is the best place.  I do love their chips and salsa though.  The medium salsa and pico is yummy!  It's quick, the servings are big, the ingredients are fresh, and the decor is cool.  The employees are a little blah though.  Slow and on the unfriendly side.  And kind of creepy looking if you ask me....
I wish they weren't such a pain on using their Groupon.  Most stores just let me use it off my Iphone app with the confirmation number.  Not them.  I have to print it and bring it in. Pain in the ass because I always forget.  By the time I get to a printer, I'm pretty sure it'll be expired."}
{"text":"Sitting outside and watching the new light rail go by was a highlight but the food is nice too. HUGE burritos."}
{"text":"Great spot for a cheap meal with delicious burritos. Excellent choice for a quick and cheap meal. Used to live right across the street and wish I had frequented more often than I did. Much better than the chain burrito spots."}
{"text":"This funky little eatery in the South End has grown quite a bit (not in size, but in appeal) over the last few years.  What started as not much more than a rather ugly yellow cinder block building on an oddly-shaped lot is now that and more - they've added some landscaping, a paved lot instead of the gravel parking and a nice outdoor eating area too.  Inside the food is the same great, simple combinations you're used to getting.

The cramped quarters also haven't changed much, but that's just part of the appeal.  As strange as it may sound, the sheer volume that moves through this place makes it possible to place your order and get a table by the time the order is ready - provided everyone cooperates and doesn't hog their table out of their place in line.  When you're done, get up and let someone else have the table, and everything keeps moving as it should.

Table tops still contain business cards from around town, and there is plenty of artwork to see as well, and the atmosphere is worth coming for, but it's the food that should keep you coming back.  While the burrito is the namesake of the place, make sure you try the quesadilla too.  They are excellent."}
{"text":"Oh, Phat Burrito, there was so much hype about you from the other reviewers and we had so much hope from you... Sorry to say that I was utterly disappointed.

To begin with, I don't like not having the option to choose how my burrito is made. I like looking over the bar, picking out things I want and leaving out things I don't want. Instead, here they just take your order at the counter and ask if you want any extras, guac / sour cream or if you are okay with lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. This isn't a burger place, no burrito place asks if you want lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. Also, they don't have any pico-de-gallo or salsa to add to the burrito by the kitchen. When I asked, they said I could pick it up from the salsa bar. Sure I can, for the chips. But if I want it in my burrito, am I supposed to unroll the whole burrito, add salsa and then roll it back up?

I had the steak burrito with guac, my boyfriend ordered chicken. The steak wasn't flavorful at all. It tasted like it was never marinated, nor grilled, just boiled. Also, the rice was overcooked with too much water, making it close to mushy and my burrito lacked flavor, spice, and tang and honestly, I didn't enjoy a single bite of it. The chicken was alright.

The last thing that ticked me off was that they had my boyfriend's burrito (part wrapped in foil, part naked) sitting on the serving counter, tortilla touching the counter top, while they picked out two plates to put the burritos on. 

Both of us left the place unhappy with our lunch and had to head to Central Coffee to get some consolation chai. Sorry Phat, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here was very poor.  The service was good and the servers were very nice.   The fish for the two tacos and the salad was dry, overcooked and bland at 6:00pm in the evening.  The toppings for the food was overcooked and under processed.  The cabbage was not chopped or tasty.  The cilantro in the mango salsa was old and tasted sour.  We will not return."}
{"text":"I give the food here 3 stars but what keeps me coming back is the welcoming, down to earth staff! They're so personable and really good at communicating when your order is coming up.

I usually order the steak taco salad w refried beans and guacamole. The food here is always fresh, but a little on the bland side so make sure to stop by the salsa bar! Very easy to order, and you're in and out fairly quickly!"}
{"text":"Oh Phat Burrito...where do I even start?  Well, being a southern California native and a Blatina (that's black Latina for those of you who don't know lol,,,it's okay, you can use it too), I have pretty high expectations for burritos. I've been running all over Charlotte looking for Mexican food that is at least comparable to the restaurants and taco shops posted on every corner of San Diego, and I'm sad to say that Phat Burrito fell short of my expectations. Funny thing is, I decided to check it out based on a good review posted by another former California resident. Now that you know a little bit about my background allow me to detail my experience at this place for you.

The Food: If my review were based solely on the food, I probably would have given Phat Burrito 3 stars. The burritos are served on really big tortillas that are stuffed to the max (if you need a comparison, think Chipotle). I ordered a chicken burrito which came packed with black beans, rice, chicken, cheese, and sour cream. Sounds really yummy right!? It was Aight. The rice was kind of undercooked and although there was plenty to nibble at, it was seriously lacking in flavor. The one plus was the fresh salsa bar (which usually comes standard at taco shops in Cali). I tried the green tomatillo salsa and it saved my burrito's life! It was mild and had an awesome combination of lime and cilantro that excited me. 

The Place: Please be warned that if you read any further and you are a fan of Phat Burrito, your feelings may be hurt because I am about to be brutally honest. 
The parking lot was cramped (already been said), but there was plenty of parking when I went so I had no problem with that. The guy at the counter is responsible for the second star. He was super friendly and enthusiastic. Gave me a minute to explore the menu before asking if I needed help and offering his suggestions which I appreciated. I sat down to indulge in what I expected to be a mind-blowing burrito, and two women sat in the booth next to mine. Halfway through my PB, one of the ladies started making a discrete fuss about something. That's when I saw it! The roach crawling up the side of the counter! The awesome guy at the register was able to SPLAT it before it got too far, but I was still in shock. If there is one thing I abhor more than bad customer service when dining out, it's bug eyed bugs! C'mon now, even if you have a bug or two here and there (let's be real ppl, it happens more often than you'd think), at least keep it concealed while I'm eating lol. It did appear to be running in from the front door area so I  gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided he came from outside and that he was the only one. Needless to say, I was full. But THEN, on my way to my car I ran into a cockroach of a different sort. The old kind that likes to pick up and hit on seemingly innocent young ladies in the parking lot. Ironically he said he knew the owner and that he knew my experience had to have been top notch...I didn't have the heart (or the time) to tell him about what had just taken place. 

I realize that this is long, but I imagine it will help someone somewhere make an informed decision. I hate doing reviews like this because I know this place has a faithful customer base and a lot of potential, but until someone can assure me that they are pest free I don't think I can make my way back to give the burrito a second chance :("}
{"text":"They have a salsa bar. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A SALSA BAR!

I took my roomie to lunch here Friday because she was kind enough to help me setup for a festival. She's the best. 

I ordered my usual: one veggie taco, one fish taco, chips and queso. I love the mango on the fish tacos. Roomie said wanna share queso? The answer is always no. I need my own. File this under fat girl review.

The roomie went with a burrito. She thought it was a little bland, so she loaded it up with salsas and hot sauce. Problem solved.

What else do you need to know? Phat Burrito is small and can get packed during lunchtime. I try to go after the lunch rush. Workers are super nice. Beer available. Tofu options on the menu."}
{"text":"had a great tilapia salad here. everything was so fresh and the presentation was wonderful. it doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside everyone is very friendly and helpful and there is a large variety of food to choose from."}
{"text":"I work within walking distance, and those fish tacos call my name every day around lunch time.  My coworker's say the rest of the menu is awesome, too but I have always stuck to the fish tacos and burritos because they are so good.  One thing to note is that the indoor seating is limited so there is sort of an unspoken rule about not lingering too long after you finish your food if there is a crowd waiting to sit down."}
{"text":"I love Phat Burrito.  I eat here frequently.  However, the service is incredibly inconsistent.  I rarely receive what I order."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is a home-grown answer to places like Moe's and Chipotle. It's a fun \"fast-casual\" option in South End with great salads, quesadillas, and burritos. (I haven't tried the tacos yet.) 

Their queso is so damn good I'm willing to overlook the chip issue (bagged Tostitos instead of house-made chips). 

Go before 10:30am for fantastic breakfast burritos and good coffee."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of places like Chiptole/Moes etc.  I went to Phat Burrito a few years ago, and I don't get burritos anywhere else!  They always use great fresh veggies and you can get whatever you like, however you like- I'm pretty picky and only like certain things on my burrito, and they will make it that way- no problem!  Their veggie burrito is fantastic, and they now offer tofu- which i recently tried, and is also very good!  The fish burrito (which I didn't try for a while) was FANTASTIC!  It comes with a mango salsa that is just amazing with the fish flavors (you can get it on the side if you aren't sure)
Some of the other reviews are true, rice can be harder at time, sometimes it isn't the cleanest of places...but this isn't Flemming's Steak House- this is a great local establishment- the guys who work behind the counter remember your face when you have been there a few times...and it is 99% of the time a fantastic burrito (or quesadilla, or taco salad- I have tried them all!)
*just note at lunch the line is OUT THE DOOR- and the wait is longer than dinner times!"}
{"text":"The end of an era.  We've been coming here for almost 20 years, and I think it has hit the lowest point ever.  Salsa bar has disappeared behind the counter.  Even worse, it tasted like rotten tomatoes, I literally spit it out.  Chicken was cold.  Cheese dip is a solid mass.  So disappointing.  We will not be back. :-("}
{"text":"Best veggie burrito I have ever eaten! I have only eaten their once, but I am definitely going to be a regular customer! This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't really see what the rage is about. I recently moved to South End and had heard a lot of hype about the place so I decided to stop in and pick some food up for dinner. I got chicken tacos and a side of rice and beans. First off, the chicken didn't really have any taste, second the sides were way over priced and also had no flavor. The black beans tasted like they were from a can. I will give kudos for the fresh lettuce and tomato on my tacos (it was actually fresh) and the service was nice. I just wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The burritos are usually good... In the service is pretty fast. I would definitely recommend going here and sitting outside by the light rail"}
{"text":"Burrito snobs beware - this place is not for you. The tortilla's gonna break, one bite'll be nothing but Guac, next, rice, you won't find your Add Jalapenos until the very end and fry your tongue on them and leftover, burrito-bottom Tortilla.

But you gotta love PB for their Classic status - like Lupie's nachos, like Dish's meatloaf, no matter how cool Burritos have become, they've made 'em this way, it's staying this way. Kind of a bummer, because I want more than just peppers and zucc in my 'rito - but kinda awesome, because beans, rice, tomatoes, cheese, various veggies, lettuce, sour cream and guac, should be enough for my Belly. Just cuz there's 6 options for meaters up there and all I get is squash, well, so be it.

Why is the rice white, why is the sky blue. These questions have no answers. So get what you can and eat it quick before it explodes all over your face/lap/shoes."}
{"text":"I hit up Phat Burrito on the regular after the gym at the South End Sport&Fitness.  Good stuff and great quantity.  Seriously - the first time I tried this place I got a to-go order... my shoulder literally dropped when the dude handed me my burrito.  The \"Phat Burrito\" name does not lie.

Tasty salsas and quality ingredients.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Tried it for breakfast and it was just ok, nothing special.  I got the veggie and it was so small.  I was still hungry afterwards.  My husband got the steak burrito and he said the meat is good but it was too small as well.  The grits are just ok too.  We've tasted a few other breakfast burritos in Charlotte and this one is definitely on the bottom of our list.  We might one day try it for lunch, but highly doubtful.  It was just very bland!"}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite place to grab dinner. Great steak tacos, guac and queso...only negative is that they haven't hade the homemade chips lately but have had bagged tostitos instead..."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review I've done from the toilet, but it's important I tell the world of this horror story.  I made my first visit to Phat Burrito yesterday in order to satisfy my  taste for Mexican food and boy did I make a mistake of coming here. I was better off just visiting a local Taco Bell; at least I know there gonna put a little meat in my burrito. Basically The burrito I received should have been called a rice burrito since that's all that was in it. And the quesadilla was just tortilla with a piece of American cheese in it. The most surprising thing of all is you think after eating just rice and tortillas  your stomach would be fine....wrong. The one little piece of meat in the burrito gave me the runs so bad I think even Mexican water couldn't compare to this.

To add to the pathetic food, the service was horrible. Not only did it take what seemed like hours for my food, the people working there wore BLM pins and treated me and my friend with complete disrespect. 

I know the world we live has learned to accept division and social hate for one another but at least if I'm paying for a service can I receive a product I am paying for? And if it's not to much to ask, with a little  respect?"}
{"text":"Great location and really good burritos. Love eating here when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment. I ordered a chicken burrito and it was incredibly bland and dry, the only flavor was from the grilled onions which tasted burnt. I ordered the queso and it was so salty I couldn't eat it- it tasted like the lid to the salt shaker fell off when they made the queso! I would not ever think of going back here."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to get my Mexican food fix when I was living out in Charlotte back in 07-08. My roomie and I loved their tacos and salsa bar. I always got chicken and steak tacos...yummers.
I remember it being kinda dark inside so I always opted for the cute little patio tables outside to sit and enjoy the fresh air and nice weather.
I think about this place whenever I get nostalgia for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Started as a fan of their burritos.. Now I go straight for the quesadillas. Phat Burrito is a hard to miss place because it is painted yellow and says \"eat here\" right on the side of the building. There are lots of places to eat in SouthEnd but Phat Burrito is a must stop if you have never tried it. Those who have will kindly agree that they've got the best burritos. 

The vibe there is very chill. You order your food and in 5 minutes or less they call your name to pick it up. They have a few beer choices and a soda fountain. They also have a salsa bar which is great because who doesn't like choosing their own salsa?!? 

They play good music and have plenty of seating inside and also a patio outside right by the rail trail. Plenty of options for protein, I will always splurge the extra cents and get bbq chicken. This place makes every other burrito joint exactly what they are.. A chain. So let go of the ball and chain and go somewhere unique."}
{"text":"The sadness of a great place going downhill. My wife and I have been eating at phat burrito since it opened, since before we were dating, and we've always loved it. Our last three visits, the salsa bar is gone, the person taking our order was not nice, the prices are higher than what is on the menu board, and the food is not nearly what it used to be. The love is gone. When we left last night, there was a guy inside waiting to order, but both of the employees were out in the parking lot, smoking weed in their car. But don't blame the weed. The love is gone and it's sad to see such a great spot go down the shitter. On the other hand, this is a great opportunity for someone to open a burrito shop just like phat burrito used to be. Bye bye phat burrito."}
{"text":"Food was delicous and filling. Got the taco salad, ordered online and was ready when I got there. Unique kind of salad and I enjoyed it very much. Had lots of flavor to it. Line was a little long for the cashier but it was lunch rush. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through yelp and when we saw it during a night of art we had to try it. It looks like a dive but the food was really good. Portions are so big we could have shared and seating was easy. The staff is super friendly and I enjoyed the whole experience. Taste is key and they did not disappoint"}
{"text":"After a half-dozen visits to this restaurants, I must sadly write this review. As vegan eaters, we tried Phat Burrito's Tofu Burrito on every visit, hoping that it would get better each time. It didn't. There are numerous reasons for our disappointment. 

1) our order was prepared incorrectly on EVERY visit. Yep, every time we came here, they got the order wrong. Wrong beans, no guac, wrong cheese (they actually put dairy-based cheese on our clearly marked \"VEGAN\" order once), NO cheese (they couldn't find the Daiya Cheese that day), etc.

2) the person at the register just wasn't paying attention on several occasions. As soon as the receipt was printed, we discovered problems. Simply REPEATING the order back to the customer would SOLVE this problem! (This is Restaurant Management 101, guys! And it works to improve order accuracy!)

3) there never seems to be anyone in charge present. No management is ever apparent; nobody seems to be overseeing the process, ensuring that things are done correctly and that problems (which are inevitable) are resolved. 

4) the tofu is literally soaked in salty brine! Way too salty!! It should be called \"pickled tofu\"!

5) the entire meal is way too salty! (Does anyone actually taste the food they serve??)

6) there seems to be no effort by anyone to understand your order, or why you're unhappy. They just seem unconcerned about whether your meal is satisfactory. 

7) the restaurant is rarely clean. How do they pass the health inspection??

Overall, the people who work there are really nice, friendly people. I actually enjoy visiting. It's a very pleasant, fun place. But, as an establishment that serves food -- food that people consume -- its a total failure!

Surely non-vegan eaters are experiencing some of the same issues here? Anyone??

This is all very sad to us, as vegans, because we are eager to find good sources of vegan friendly eats. 

This place should be doing a better, more consistent job. I hope they improve and I will gladly upgrade my review when that occurs. But until I hear a good report from a fellow vegan eater, we will avoid this place!"}
{"text":"me at phat burrito: ill have 1 fish taco and 1 .... crap I still can't decide but I know he really wants the rest of my order right now .... and 1 fountain drink... and 1.. (enter random yet always delicious second taco)

my sister and I were shopping in the area when lunch time arrived. I knew I had thrown my pb groupon into my purse before we left in case we were still nearby, and she reaally wanted a salad. luckily, we could both be happy. 

I ordered two tacos, yes the fish was amazing, but what was interesting was the salad. They have a good \"selection\", okay pretty much the same base with whatever protein you want thrown on top (and maybe a bean choice), but the way it's presented had many people in line asking and ordering what she was eating (we were in the booths between the register and the restrooms) I personally would have smothered the thing in pico and hot salsa from the lovely bar, but she was more than content with her chicken, beans, cheese, and lettuce. (there may have been a few more ingredients, but I was focused on my tacos. the pointing from the register did catch me off guard though) 

My main rule (that I have to admit I've been breaking lately as I've come to love my knife-point decisions) for phat is, if you don't know what you want, step to the side. Not that everyone is in a hurry, but everyone there is efficient. If you need more time reading the board, no biggie, just let the people behind you go. There seems to be some perfectly oiled machine of order/create/name calling that even on my first visit I caught onto and was extremely nervous to upset. I have realized those who are unaware of this are probably the same people who wait 20 minutes in line at starbucks and still don't know what they want when they get to the counter, and I understand the employee's occasional frustration. Just order with your gut and move on- it's all good."}
{"text":"Was NOT disappointed. This is not your cookie cutter burrito joint. Authentic food, great authentic staff. When I walked in I was greeted by everyone. Let's just say I'll be back very soon..... With friends!"}
{"text":"Basic fast and reasonable  take out Mexican.  The issue is this is that place without the actual Mexican cook in the back who knows how to really season things and layer Mexican flavors.  Go here for a big serving of well prepared but under seasoned Mexican that still beats Moe's any day."}
{"text":"The best burrito place ever!!  I have been coming to Phat Burrito for the past 9 years religiously!  The BBQ chicken burrito and tacos are amazing, as well as the chips and queso.  Now that I live in Raleigh, there are times when I have heavy withdrawls.  So every time I am in Charlotte, there is no doubt I have to make a stop here, even if its to get it to-go with some extra to take home with me!  You will not be disappointed, the atmosphere is fantastic and so is the crew."}
{"text":"Eight years ago I frequented Phat Burrito. The last time I was there, my daughter was 6 years old. She is now 14 and about to turn 15. We were in NC visiting her great-grandmother who is now passed and her Aunt Jennifer was with us. Jennifer now lives in Dubai. We sat outside on the patio at Phat and took pictures, but I never took a picture of the sign. One of those pictures sits in my daughters room, so I often reminiscence about your burritos. 

Much has changed in that time and we have made many more trips to Charlotte were I have tried to figure out what burrito place that was.

I didn't travel to Charlotte for a year then and lost sight of Phat. I didn't use yelp then; it took me til today to figure it out again. I won't forget this time. You were a strong memory to me and I have driven all over town on various trips to figure out where you were. My daughter said she wanted a burrito so yelp helped me find you today. 

She had the Phat Steak Burrito and I had the Veggie. Huge. Delicious. And we took half away with us. The queso and beer were and added bonus and my daughter is rocking the shirt she bought! 

Sooooo glad we found you again. I have not had a burrito quite like this since way back in the day off a food truck in Athens, OH.

Keep rockin' it. The store looks great and quite bigger! 

Five stars to me."}
{"text":"Good Breakfast burrito

Only been here for breakfast and it hit the Spot.   I got the \"southend western?\" or something along those lines, and it hit all my requirements.  

Big
Good meat Flavor
Nice done Eggs.
Spicy 
messy ending bite.

I would get a breakfast burrito again from them."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated and \"cool\" just because people say it is (and because, yeah, it is a funny name)

It's incredibly overpriced-- $9 for a damn burrito-- with no chips, no guac, no sour cream, NO CHEESE-- all those cost extra?

plus, handful of times i've been here (because my friends insisted they liked it... until i brought them to reality), they salsa containers have been empty, and stayed empty even after I notified the staff. By they time they refilled them, everyone else in my group had eaten so I felt I needed to eat anyway, even without the salsa (which i desperately needed because bland meat, rice, and beans in a plain tortilla wrap just isn't that yummy)

the food is seriously bland unless you get all sorts of add-ons, which is unreasonable because it costs so dang much to begin with!"}
{"text":"This Phat burrito visit was beyond disappointment. Maybe I'm spoiled as a California native... But, I don't think so. After a night of brewery hopping, I was in dire need of a breakfast burrito and was so excited to find Phat burritos breakfast menu.. The poblano gravy got me. We walked in an ordered two Camden blocks with smoked sausage. The staff was nice and helpful but, that couldn't off set the crap breakfast burritos. 

When I was handed my order, I thought back to my last visit. Bland and small burritos. Again, our burritos were extremely tiny, I couldn't justify the $13 I just spent on this \"taquito\" looking burritos. Phat burrito, first, I'm disappointed in your size. Phat Burrito is a misnomer, y'all should be named Tiny Ass Burrito. Number two, Phat burrito discontinued their salsa bar. Who does that?! Bad idea. We come home to even more disappointment! The burritos were so tasteless even Tabasco couldn't save them. The filling was so dry, I almost broke a tooth on a nuked potato piece. And of course, no poblano gravy anywhere! The burrito was more tortilla than anything. Overall, just ... Crap! 

We ended up throwing these burritos out and going to Blaze Pizza for edible food. Phat Burrito, I will never come back."}
{"text":"The bbq quesadilla wasn't bad, but was a little pricey considering it didn't come with sour cream or guac. I thought the atmosphere was really cool, and the people were friendly. Next time I'll try a burrito."}
{"text":"Wow what a let down... still shaking me head. The beans tasted old and with filler... they were horrible! And the steak... where was that? I think I got two or three pieces... the cheese was all clumped at the bottom... and the salsa bland as hell. 

The beer was the only thing I finished. Ugh what a true let down. I was waiting five hours to get there and try them ( I was at Aveda getting my hair did)... ack and then the return... heartburn city. 

I will give them one more try, but hold the beans--those were disgusting. Beans should be WHOLE damn it. Not a mashed up mess of crap. 

Maybe a taco next time... but never again with the beans."}
{"text":"I had high expectations because I was told that it is better than chipotle and moes. The queso was good but the burrito itself was average. It had way more rice and beans then chicken. I ended up taking half of the rice out."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty monster sized burritos.  The queso dip was really good,too.

Slightly pricier and no real separation from what you get at Chiptole, so I may or may not go back."}
{"text":"Mehh... not the best, not even in the top 10. 

Phat Burrito?? It should be called Rice Burrito. I got the chicken and it was at least 75% rice - they totally skimped on the chicken and added hardly any veggies. 

I will give them props for having various salsas... but lets be honest, what mexican burrito place wouldn't??

*Best tip about this place: the atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Phat Burrito. The food was delish, the vibe was chill and the customer service was amazing. It's definitely a cool low key spot if you want a quick meal full of real ingredients."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after living in the area for a few months, but I was unfortunately left disappointed. 

The pros: friendly staff, flavorful salsas (ask to try the habanero sauce!) and the queso was delish. 

The cons: the burrito was incredibly bland. It seemed like most of it was rice and beans, which would be ok if they had actually put the time into seasoning those components. The best part if the burrito was that I put salsa on it. Without that, it would've tasted of nothing."}
{"text":"Phat Burrito is a great local spot with a unique vibe.  It's the anti-Chipotle.  If you are a chain restaurant whore, you won't appreciate this place.  The service is fast and friendly but they don't wear uniforms and are likely to call you 'dude' or 'bro' vs 'sir'.  At first glance, it's a dive.  Stick it out and let the atmosphere grow on you.  Personally, I enjoy the originality of the decor vs. Subway, Chipotle, or every other restaurant that looks the exact same no matter where you are.  

The trick to maximizing your experience here is to ask for exactly what you want.  Use the menu as a guide but then specify your preferences.  You wouldn't go to Chipotle, order a chicken bowl, then cross your fingers that it comes out exactly how you like it.  If you want them to add cilantro or go heavy on the cheese- tell them so they can accommodate you.  I'm a big fan and make it a point to frequent this spot whenever I'm in town.  There's literally no where else like it."}
{"text":"This is another one of my favorite taco spots. I come here often for their fish tacos and bbq chicken burritos. There've been a couple times I came when the line got long and the staff seemed totally overwhelmed. Another perk to this place is their atm . . .  only a 50 cent usage charge."}
{"text":"It truly breaks my heart to write this review. I am squirming in my seat as I speak, or type I guess. I really really really want to love Phat Burrito, I mean, really. It just isn't the same anymore and I can't hold on any longer. 

I love the location, I love the decor, I love the murals, or \"pieces\" in urban terms, and the overall charm that emits from this place. The restaurant is super cool, hip, eclectic and is a spot where regulars don't need a menu (if you can find it). Phat Burrito brings me back to the days of b-boying and ya know, my ghetto youth. 

It's just, what's all that charm without good food? I'm not all superficial. I appreciate a little substance and I've given Phat Burrito enough chances to love me back. Each visit just seems to get worse, and today's lunch was a kick in the nuts. 

Now, the fish taco was good; grouper, charbroiled on an optional CORN tortilla (yay) and topped with a mango salsa. Yep pretty yumm. Tortillas are grilled rather than steamed, which I adore. The burrito though was another utter disappointment. 

The beans were al dente - hard. Rice was bland and soggy, thus making my burrito wet and causing it to crack in half. The chicken was bland and dry. Every other bite was hard with a few burnt pieces. While the portions are nice, the burrito as a whole was just lacking something; flavor. Mediocre IMO. 

I've practically tried everything on the menu (not hard to do), but my heart belongs to chicken. But when the chicken continually does you wrong, whats a fellow to do now but move on to the next one."}
{"text":"Can I say anything bad about phat burrito? No I can't. Nothing beats a bbq chicken burrito. The food is fresh and flavorful. The salsa bar has a great variety and the service is chill and laid back. Just found out they are serving breakfast now too. 
Only advice I have is try to avoid this place during peak hours. Other than that you're always in for a treat."}
{"text":"Order the bbq chicken taco's with mango salsa. 

Try not to hit them up right at noon, go a bit earlier or later."}
{"text":"The food here comes in large portions and everything tastes pretty good.  I wouldn't call it authentic, but I enjoy the eclectic look and feel of the place, the friendly staff and that the food is made to order.

I've  tried the chicken burrito and the chicken quesadilla.  Both were huge.  Each is enough for two girls to split as a meal.  I like that they give sour cream on the side with their quesadilla.  Mmmm, more fat to ladle onto my cheesy fat pie.  

Their salsa bar is pretty standard, not always the freshest looking pico de gallo, but a solid place to drop by, fill up and feel satisfied."}
{"text":"Had the steak burrito. Opted to add guacamole and sour cream. It was huge and only took half of one to fill me up and I'm a 230lb guy!"}
{"text":"Phat burrito is there every time you need it! great burritos!!! Love it here. Southend staple!"}
{"text":"This place is a quaint little spot. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and asked if I would be dining in or carrying out. Having never been here, I told the couple behind me to go ahead... Lol the simple menu was just so tempting. The inside decor was similar to that of Common Market, so no need for a suit and tie here. 

I ordered a chicken burrito with both sour cream and guacamole. I waited maybe 5 minutes before my order was called, so that was perfect. The burrito was packed and everything was so fresh. The burrito wasn't heavily seasoned with a bunch of sauce so all my ingredients provided a little melody with every bite. 

With the restaurant being a small spot, better air flow would help because it was warm inside even with the fans going (I'm sure it's perfect in the winter)."}
{"text":"Since Cabo's changed their menu features, I'd have to say Phat burritos offer the best fish tacos in town."}
