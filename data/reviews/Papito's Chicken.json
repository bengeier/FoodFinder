{"text":"Great grilled chicken, garnished with rich spices. It's also halal.  Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Just had the chicken wrap. Really well done wrap with exceptional flavours. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem, one of the best chicken places in town"}
{"text":"Wow! So good! What a hidden gem! :)  I only found out about it when somebody in my building came into the elevator with this takeout. It smelled so good, I had to ask where they got it!"}
{"text":"Visited this place after got several recommendations.  Ordered burgers for kids and their flame grilled chicken with rice and garlic sauce.  Chicken was absolute bliss - marinated to perfection, perfect tenderness, and most perfect spice level that we could ask for.  Initially planned to dine in - but seating did not suit us so we requested to change the order to-go.  While walking back to our vehicle, the aroma of the food made us change the decision of taking it to home - we ate (in very quick timeframe) in car and all of us agreed that it's very similar concept to Nando's but way better than Nando's first location in every aspect.  Definitely a place to go again - and again - and again!"}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN IN TOWN. I agree with other reviewers they are a Hidden Gem for sure.  The staff is very friendly and everyone is really nice.  HOWEVER, their Just Eat or Online request service is Terrible. 3 for 3 I ordered online and they for whatever reason did not get my order even though I was sent an email Confirmation for my order all 3 times. Each time when I called them they acted none the wiser and I ended up getting my order 2 hours later. This last time the man they had deliver my food was so awful. When I asked for the machine [because I specified on the online order form that I would pay via Credit Card]  he crassly told me that HE PAID for my food, \"that is how delivery works\" and also demanded a tip after such shitty service and again my order was actually delivered 2 hours later. I was totally offended. This establishment has not offered any sort of discount or compensation for their error and this is extremely frustrating especially when you get a confirmation that says your order will be out to you within 45mins.    I feel that if a business is going to offer online methods of service they need to be on top of that. I should not have to call an hour later and ask where my order is. In that case I could have ordered from a dozen more places in the area. I stay faithful because the chicken is amazing BUT they really need to brush up on their online order taking."}
{"text":"I went to try out this place on a Sunday night and the place was completely empty.  Could it be that all of these glowing reviews are accurate given that the place was empty?  We were discouraged by this sight and chose its nearest competitor instead and it was bustling with customers.  So it wasn't the day or the weather that was an issue.   I leave the review as a 3 star not knowing for sure what to think.   The posted reviews are extraordinary good but lacking in depth or numbers. Hope that I can try this on another day when the risk of being lulled into trying a place is not rewarded with an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"They are right next door to nova.  Incredible chicken at incredible prices. 19 dollars for a full chicken done better than nandos. And in 10 minutes. Come on. I dare you to find better for cheaper because I can't. 5 star."}
{"text":"I've been going to Papitos once monthly since moving here. I love their chicken as it's flavorful and moist. It is definitely oily and not something healthy to have all the time, but even ripping the skin off and eating the chicken with the hot sauce on the side is still really good. Their garlic pita side is so good!"}
{"text":"I am working in the area and was on my way to walk down to the Safeway or Subway when I passed this little place. There were a few people inside and the food looked good through the window. I ordered a chicken burger with fries and it was very good. They make their own mayo - aoli and there is a slight spice to the fresh chicken. One of the best chicken burgers I have ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing! The chicken is so tender and moist! We had a half chicken plate and a chicken kebab plate, both with the spicy sauce (which is to die for). The restaurant itself is very unassuming, but the service is wonderful and the food incredible. I am sad it has taken us this long to check this place out! We will definitely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"This place is brand new and a hidden gem. Not for long!   The chicken is the star here and it's all they serve alongside their absurdly amazing sides. That garlic sauce is so thick and amazing. The chicken meals are out of this world and HUGE. The owner is the sweetest man.  This place is the real deal. Mini begged me for weeks to come back. It's her favorite. In fact, I type this as we sit in Papitos and mini is silent. A rare feat. Why is she silent? The picture I posted with this is what she is eating, the half chicken meal. The plate is bigger than her!   I'm kind of hoping this place stays hidden so we can keep having the place to ourselves!  The wrap, burgers, and sides are stellar. Oh. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken in Calgary? Such a rarity. When a place offers a half chicken with fries and pita bread for only $12, it's hard to say no.  I came here late in the evening to grab some take-out. The 4 chicken pieces were pre-cooked but grilled on order, which I think that's what Nando's does as well; otherwise, it would take forever to cook the pieces from raw. The marinade that they used was incredible. Spicy and tangy, it's some of the best marinade I've ever had. The chicken pieces were a bit dry probably because it was getting close to closing time.  Fries were thick-cut but soggy. Could've been because I ordered take-out. I didn't know what to do with the pita bread 'cause the meal didn't come with a salad or anything moist other than the chicken marinade. Was I supposed to rip the meat out and stick it in the wrap? Yeah I'm a noob.  $12 at this place will definitely satisfy your hunger. I feel like the chicken could be really good depending on the time of day you show up because that marinade combined with tender and moist meat would be heaven. Unfortunately, I came at the wrong time so I fell back down to Earth."}
{"text":"We have been here twice so far since we found this amazing gem of a place. Second time we took friends with us as well. It's a family owned restaurant. The people who owns it and manage it are so nice. Service was great. The place is small so not suitable for huge crowds. I had called in and made a reservations for 7 people so it was nice they were able to do that even though I read on yelp they don't take reservations. Food was amazing. A full chicken is suitable for 2 people. Love their garlic sauce. All of their meat is halal FYI. I thought it was very affordable as well. You get 1 full chicken with 1 side for $19. And omg so delicious. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A meal well done!  I arrived during the dinner rush at 7:30pm. There are lots of take-outs coming in and out of the restaurant, but I chose to sit down as I want to try it when it's still hot and fresh from the grill.  I ordered a half chicken with a tabouli salad and a side of tikka. The food arrive at a reasonable time (it is from the grill so it does take time to cook). The chicken is SO juicy and tender! The meat falls off the bone with minimal and effortless chewing. The marinade is flavourful. This is truly a grill chicken I'm craving for!  The tabouli salad is very nice and decent portion. The tikka taste good. The meat was juicy and cook just right.  The meal left me satisfied and happy and I will come back for sure! Thanks for the fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is grilled with portugeuse inspired spices but the owner states his particular marinade is one of the best in the city. And I have to agree with him.  The chicken is very tender with super amazing flavors and it pairs well with the garlic sauce. This place is better than nandos chicken. Quick fast food with large portions, I'll definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"$19 for a whole chicken and a salad. But not just any chicken. This was perfectly spiced and served with a smile. Great deal and great food. So good."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! So tender and flavorful! One of the best I have had! Probably not a good sit in restaurant but would definitely recommend to anyone lookin for some great food! I had the meal with garlic pita and it was out of the world!"}
