{"text":"The food was very good.  A little disappointed in the service. I felt really bad for the one waitress that had to take care of the whole dinning room.  My recommendation is if you have time go here, but don't expect to get in and out quick."}
{"text":"First time to Martino's and it was very good.  Service was friendly, patient and glasses were always full!  I had the Sinatra Penne with Chicken and it was quite tasty, was an oversized portion but the sauce was on the heavy side for my tastes.  I had leftovers for the next day and they were just as good as the first time.    Nice atmosphere but a LOT of tvs, which seemed kind of odd for the overall smallish space, but great if you want to watch 10 things at once (I didn't) Good place for families, dates and small parties.  Cannolis were better than the last ones I had, without being overly sweet, but the outside pastry was quite good.  Would like to try a hoagie or wrap next time.  The menu had a pretty varied selection and everything was well priced.  I would definitely try it again!"}
{"text":"After battling a craving for a Steel City Sandwiches (similar to the Famous Primanti Bros) my sister told me about Martino's. She brought me take out from there (the steak sandwich) several months ago and it was incredible. While the bread isn't a sliced french bread like Primanti's it's still a great sandwich inspired by the original.   The pastrami is juicy and tender and smothered in provolone and the slaw is crisp and tangy. This sandwich is a monster and though I try my best, every time I'm left with half a sandwich and a mini mountain of fries. The fries are hand cut and fresh and the chips are house made both complimented with a sprinkling of Malt vinegar that resides on the table. We've also enjoyed the Caesar salad, appetizer sampler, chicken Marsala, Shrimp Scampi, pizza and spaghetti.     The restaurant is located in Afton Village towards the back and is tastefully decorated. The booths are comfortable and the tables covered with white butcher paper to doodle while you wait for your food. The wait would be the only thing preventing Martino's from receiving 5 stars. The several times we've been the service has been somewhat off. Avery got it right with nice friendly servers that just forget requests and are just not in a hurry. There is an unusually long wait for food if you don't order an app or salad to start with but when it finally comes its just delicious.   Hooray for Martino's! You deserve 5 stars and we'll keep going till you get it right!"}
{"text":"This was once was one of our weekly favorite places to grab a pizza. However over the past several months we have been let down. The pizza is either burned, not cooked all the way, or just does not taste good. Not sure what changed but I do know it is off our radar for a while. Please fix whatever you changed you all use to have the best pizza ever."}
