{"text":"This is a restaurant I go to because I am hungry, want good, healthy food, pleasant service and I try something new almost every time. May, the nice young lady who always has a smile and great suggestion is a 5 Star server. It's also a good idea to order some fried chicken to go once you finish your meal."}
{"text":"I think most Chinese foodies would agreed that, interior decorating have nothing to do with quality of food, especially when it comes to Chinese food. As the matter of fact, I find that the more run down some place looks, the more intriguing it becomes.  I dragged a couple Chinese friends with me to check out this place a couple days ago.  Verdict: Surprisingly good! Although some dishes may be a bit altered for american palate, but it still retains a good amount of authenticity.  Also, the salty fried pork chop is pretty damn amazing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for AUTHENTIC Chinese food, then this is the place! Obviously, you have to stay away from the lunch buffet, which is American style Chinese food. And, you may have to ask for the \"Chinese menu\" (lots of authentic Chinese restaurants have an American menu and a Chinese menu... I'm not sure if its the case here, but they always give us a menu stocked with authentic food).  Some of our favorites are the black fungus (mushroom) with beef, and the tofu with red chili peppers.  Seriously, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I initially had no intention to try this place ... drove by many time and though to myself it looks like another american-chinese place ....  But a friend recommended for dinner saying that they have authentic cantonese food .... I was sold when I was told they have \"winter melon soup\" , a place couldn't be all that bad if they offer this kind of specialty dish in general ... and it has to be pre-ordered a day in advance since it takes 3-4 hours to prepare . So we did .....   As I get there, I was very doubtful it could be any good judging by the deco. I do agree that it looks very out-dated and definitely need some work in both of the interior and exterior .... but the service was good and that I can see they offer a some specialty dishes on their chinese menu.  I am not sure about the buffet but if you were to order off the menu, it is actually very good. A lot of authentic cantonese dishes , I had the black pepper beef and the fish stomach with veggies. The beef was very tendered and it was very favorful with a lot of \"wok heh\"  and the fish stomach were very good as well, I haven't been able to found this dish in Phoenix till here. I was very impressed. And the pre-ordered winter melon soup was outstanding, it was huge and with plenty of soup and ingredient inside, and will feed 5-6 people easily.  I haven't had this for years and was very happy with the way the cook it, as if I were having it in Hong Kong.   Highly recommended this place if you know what to order or have a friend that do.  I have never been to their buffet and still have no intent to try it ... so I cannot speak for that.   Will go back and try some other dishes :)  The only thing of this place is the decor, but if that doesn't bother you and you are up for some authentic cantonese food, this is a good place to try and it may surprise you."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out since it's by my work and cheap (5.99 w/drink).  As the other stated its a basic place.  There are only a few food options.  What they had was good but they are missing alot.  The lady was very nice and the food was pretty fresh.  Basically what I remember was there was Sweet and Sour chicken, Pork in some black bean sauce, another chicken in some sauce (kung pao maybe), breaded drumstick, rice, chow main, teriyaki chicken and egg flour soup.  I don't do seafood so there may have been something that I'm forgetting.  Anyways you'll have about 6 or 7 things to choose from and its all decent.  Mainly going 3 stars for a very limited selection.  If your into \"hole in the wall\" places check it out.  If your a fan of the bigger chinese buffets you won't be satisfied."}
{"text":"Singapore Rice Noodles are fantastic, really! So ridiculously good that EVERY time I eat here I get them, and sometimes another dish just to say that I've tried other stuff. They will make the dish as large or spicy as you want (I often get an extra-large portion extra spicy - which is 1.5 times size of normal) but straight up off he menu is probably just as good. Most of their other dishes are good too, depends on what you like, but don't judge this place without trying the Singapore noodles.  Ps, yes the decor is old & cheesy but at least it's clean, the staff (actually the cooks granddaughter I think) is super friendly, and you can always order as takeout. Pss, the very small almost gimmicky lunch buffet is not their best feature so don't eat that & think the menus items are the same."}
{"text":"Read a review from the newspaper so I tried it. Not impressed. The atmosphere is about as dismal as the food. They need to make it a place people want to come in and eat instead of get out of there as soon as possible. Gross!"}
{"text":"One of the worst chinese food places I've been to. Had trouble finding a table to sit at that didn't need clearing from food. From the look of the floors, I wouldn't be surprised if they just wipe the tables off straight onto the floor. Food was incredibly mediocre.   I thought I would give the place a second shot a few days later, in case that they just had a bad day with the food, but it was just as bad, and the cashier yelled at me on my way out of the door that I had not paid. After showing her my receipt that I did in fact pay, she showed no remorse in her accusal. Fits the \"don't give a ***\" attitude I saw on my first visit. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I went in for the lunch buffet and I will never return.  There are better buffets with greater selections around the same price.  The selection here was limited compared to other chinese buffets I have been to, and what they did have was low quality and low on taste.  The pork was chewy and seemed old, I spit it out after taking a bite.  I don't know how one makes teriyaki chicken taste bad, but they were sure successful here because the sause was greasy and the chicken chewy (probably low quality meat).  The sweet and sour sauce tasted weird, and the hot mustard was not hot and seemed watery.  I only ate some of the chow mein and fried rice, both of which wasn't great either.    I am not quite sure how this place is in business, with the quality of the food.   I did not try any dinner menu items - so I will withhold judgment, though I will never return to find out for sure."}
{"text":"Oh nomnomnom I've finally found really, really good Chinese food in Phoenix!  I admit to both a. never realizing this place was even here and b. likely not having gone in when on a Friday evening there were only 3 cars in the lot outside. But a New Times article recommended it so we donned our intrepid explorer hats and went in. So glad we did!   First, there are two menus- one most Americans are probably used to, and another that's more traditional Chinese. Go for the latter and try some of the more popular dishes that are labeled \"recommended\". The wings are so crispy and tasty- wings!- and the West Lake soup was a good choice on a cooler evening. We also had a pan fried noodle dish of beef and tomatoes, which was pretty perfect.   They even have a few items you have to call a day in advance to order- a neighboring table had a large soup served in a gourd called Winter Melon Soup that looked and smelled divine.   Don't miss this place. Look for the vintage neon sign on the NWC of Indian School & 24th Street."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese, so I Love Chinese food! We just moved to Phoenix, drove by this place a few times, and couldn't really tell if it's good from the outside (never judge a book by its cover!). We like trying out new places. Today I was craving for a noodle soup dish after a busy week, so on the way back home, we decided to stop there and give it a try (even though the Yelp reviews weren't the best). Sooooo glad we did!!! It just became our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix!   We ordered beef with rice flat noodle and beef flank noodle soup. OMG! So delicious! It's totally authentic Cantonese style and the portion was huge!!! We didn't think we could finish everything, but it was so yummy that we cleaned out the dishes.   The owner was very friendly and her son helps her with all the English, so cute!   So happy we just found out go to Chinese place!"}
{"text":"I regret that this was one of the worst food experiences of my life. The meat was not recognizable. Would not consider another dinner here."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! They do not have buffet for dinner (bummer). Really long menus (lots of option). Super friendly service. Im coming back soon."}
{"text":"Really good, really authentic Chinese food.  They have a legit menu and a white people menu.  I generally get the black pepper beef, as it's fantastic.  Very tender beef.  Tonight girlfriend had the orange chicken.  The chicken was very tender and perfectly cooked.  She had nothing but nice things to say and she's super picky, judgmental, and hard to please when she dines out and takes Yelp-y instagram pictures of all of our food.  Like seriously, everywhere.  (Please don't read that babe, love you.)  Quick and friendly service also.  Never have been disappointed coming here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch since I drive past it near my new place. It was bad.. I had the fried chicken and it was pink. Rest was greasy and didn't taste good. 2 stars for how cheap it was but this place was full of large people who don't know good Chinese and this wasn't good."}
{"text":"The pot stickers were great!  We ordered off the American menu and it was \"ok..\"  I would rather eat \"American\" Chinese food somewhere else.  We definately want to come back to try the traditional menu.  Another table ordered the stuffed Duck and it looked amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place they have great food, always fresh and good prices for the family combos and they let you substitute which most Chinese places don't let you. The meat is not chewy either like I find most places are. Big size portions and they put a lot of meat instead of all vegetables, like most places who only put a few pieces of meat. I would definitely recommend this place and this comes from a picky eater."}
{"text":"From the outside you would definitely drive past. But we stopped in based on the recommendation of the new times and we're pleasantly surprised. Husband ordered Singapore rice noodles and I ordered salt and pepper steak from the Chinese menu. By the end of the meal we were switching dishes as I enjoyed his and he enjoyed mine more. Waitress with extra sweet and the food was delivered very quickly."}
{"text":"Its now February 2015 and New Hong Kong continues to be our go to Chinese restaurant.  We call a soon as we decide to go to see if we can reserve a roast duck.  We always get West Lake Soup.  We have tried many of the clay pots we love all the XO sauce dished, especially the XO fish.  We have tried a lot of the noodle dishes too.  Everything is wonderful!  Real Chinese food prepared wonderfully.  Relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"We had lunch today. Their food is very salty. Had their pork fried rice but the rice was overcooked.  Beef and broccoli  was salty . Beef was like jerky. The food had a lot of msg. I do like their  vegetables  as it is nice and chrisp. Best dish was the fried chicken.  Chowmein noodles were way too salty"}
{"text":"Nope, not for us. Kung pao chicken was waaay too spicy. Chicken on both dishes we ordered was mushy and fatty (kung pao and cashew). Potstickers were delicious but the sauce was weird - not the normal sauce that comes with potstickers. We ended up using soy sauce. Service was okay. Restaurant was dingy.  Do yourself a favor and go to China Village right down the street for a better meal."}
{"text":"Bottom line: this place is pretty gross.  We went for the $5.99 lunch buffet - well you can say: \"you got what you paid for\"; but in reality it was barely worth $0.99. First off, the buffet has 10 entrees, but when we went, only 3 entrees were replenished, the rest sat there empty the whole time! at 1pm! So basically I could try spring rolls, fried chicken, and rice... for the $5.99. And it was not good. At all. The entire place is pretty damn filthy. Last time I had lunch here was in 2000, and it doesn't look like they have cleaned since. Whatever you do, don't look under the table! The service was not good either. Not friendly or welcome, just point to a table and mutter some words. It's pretty obvious the owners also operate the place, so at least you save some money because tipping is inappropriate when the owners are also the staff (you are just giving them free money at that point).  We examined the buffet and asked, before deciding to stay, if it was going to be replenished soon. Our server just pointed at the buffet and nodded. ok? I guess that means yes. Well apparently it meant no. My friend asked her: \"What are the entrees?\"  she points, again, and just says \"5.99\".  Here is the convo: \"What are the entrees today?\" \"5.99\" \"Yes, but what will the food items be when you replenish them?\" \"buffet over there\" \"Yes, we see that, but what do we get for $5.99?\" \"Food at buffet\" \"Yes, but there is nothing there, so we don't know what we'll be eating when you bring out the food. What are you going to serve?\" \"5.99\" No joke. My friend just got up and left. My other friend and I made the poor decision of staying. Well needless to say, we never found out what the other food was going to be - though I assume based on what was left in the bottom of the pans it was going to be some brown slop. The spring roll tasted like a frozen one that was defrosted and served. The rice was so rock hard I had to spit it out. The fried chicken was just ok.  The MSG coma hit us about 20 mins after leaving. That food is really poor quality. So.... filthy restaurant, unfriendly service, empty buffet, bad food....  $5.99 all you can eat! lol I cannot recommend this place to anyone other than transients and trailer trash. Which brings up the next topic: the other patrons. We did get some entertainment value from the other crazy patrons. They must have some real characters wander off the street into this place. One guy came in and was yelling at himself, then yelled at the buffet food, then yelled at other patrons, then had a full meltdown and stormed out of the place. 10 mins later he comes and sits down, and apparently is friendly with the owners. LOL. and he had a mysterious animal in a kennel under his table. That was allowed. and nobody asked him to stop being weird with other customers and settle down. My assumption is that this is the norm for this place, the clientele isn't exactly.... top shelf.  Best part? they have a sign that says \"2012 Best of Phoenix - Best Chinese Restaurant\"..... I stared at it... it was incredulous. This must be a hoax. That made me laugh because it was just so ridiculous. You just walk into the place and you know for a fact that it is NOT best of anything. Ever.  UPDATE: within a few hours of dining there, I had horrible explosive diarrhea.  New Hong Kong is not for the faint of stomach."}
{"text":"This is a very good family-gathering type of restaurant. I am very pleased to be able to find sea cucumber and abalones here. Their sweet pork with sesame seeds was delicious. I always have to order this when I come."}
{"text":"The portions are really great, the value was good for the price and the quality was what I expected for Take Out Chinese Food.  The only negative comment I can make was that it took almost two hours for the delivery to arrive.  I don't know if that's because I ordered on New Years Day but it was a bit difficult to figure out where my order was after calling back about 1 1/2 hours after placing the order.  The person answering the phone couldn't figure out if my order was on it's way or not.  I'll give it another shot because the food was pretty good and satisfied my New Year's family tradition of Take Out Chinese."}
{"text":"To start off, this place is actually called \"New Hong Kong\" restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-hong-kong-phoenix  It was originally called Hong Kong Restaurant from the 1950's and they kept the 60 year old sign in the parking lot (kinda nostalgic).  If you look at the sign on the building, it says New Hong Kong (kind of confusing when you Yelp it)  If you ask any of the old school chinese who have lived in central phoenix for the past 50 years where to get authentic home style cooking, they know it's at NHK.  If you ask the buffet community where to eat, this place is probably not on the top 100 (disclaimer:  I've never eaten the lunch buffet)  Sadly, it seems that the old school chinese community that patronize this place don't give it the Yelp reviews that it deserves, hence the low ratings.  If you're looking for traditional Cantonese style food, here's a list of semi-authentic stuff I recommend:  1) Beef chow fun 2) Tomato beef over Hong Kong style noodles 3) Fish filet over Gai Lon (Chinese broccoli) 4) Salt/pepper chicken wings (not on the menu) 5) Peking pork chops 6) West lake beef soup 7) X.O. green beans  If you want to go hard core Toi-sahn hillbilly style home cooking like poh-poh and ngain-ngain used to make:  1) Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) 2) Foo-guah guy, Ow-see (Bitter melon chicken with black been sauce) 3) Gee-ngoke-beng (Steamed pork with preserved salty fish) 4) Hoh-yeow gai-lon (Steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce) 5) Bok-jom-guy (Boiled chicken with garlic and ginger sauce) 6) Muy-choi-kow-yuk (Fatty pork hot-pot with preserved vegetable) 7) Bok choy with black mushroom  Occasionally, they will bring out the compimentary house special Doang-guah gong (winter melon) or linh-gnaw gong (some sort of chinese turnip) soup.  This place is a well kept secret, spread the wealth I tell ya."}
{"text":"THANK YOU GUYS FOR A GREAT DINNER!!!!!! What a find! I have no idea why the low raters are giving this restaurant low points...shows how random people can be!!...This was a great break from the plastifyed chain restaurants and overpriced cocktail-driven bad food so abundant in this town. The looks of the place gave it away immediately as one of those real restaurants that gets its customers not by decor or attitude but by true to the heart excellent food. The food was delicious, well prepared, and passed the test of my family group of 12 picky people all of whom who have eaten Chinese food in great restaurants in New York, San Francisco, Vancouver, and even China.  Each one of us ordered a dish and we ate family style, two from the \"American\" menu and about 12 from the \"Authentic\"menu. All dishes were delicious and generous. We loved  the black mushrooms w/ back choi (mushrooms were stewed and the bak choi was crunchy and soft). The mutton hot pot was a hit, and so was the Monk- vegetables dish with pinon nuts and wood ear mushrooms. The sesame pork was a hit with my nephews who claimed it had been the crunchiest they had and the less cloying. The Peking duck was super crispy and served with the fluffy steamed rolls. The steamed chicken with ginger sauce (we call this dish Hainanese Chicken) was perfect. Noodle dishes such as Singapore Curry noodles were excellent too!!!  Prices were moderate and the service was top notch.    The staff was friendly, warm and super attentive. The waitress even humored my elderly Mom who is a stickler for every single detail of what goes into her food. The waitress should be canonized.   Bonus detail: the bathroom was impeccable!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with visitors from Hong Kong and China looking for a break from American food. We decided on this place based on reviews of having an American menu and a Chinese menu. The direct response from our expert visitors was the chicken was good, the vegetable was too sweet, noodle with beef needle a little more flavor. All in all difficult to compare to authentic Chinese food, but was a welcome treat for weary Chinese travelers missing home."}
{"text":"I got their spicy green beans, Singapore noodles, and claypot with pork and taro. I am beyond impressed how good it was. I can eat this until it kills me. A lot of flavors, very savory. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"I love this place -- it's no-frills, but friendly and always delicious.  If you follow their recommendations on the Cantonese Chinese style menu (some dishes are labeled \"Recommend\" or \"Highly Recommend\"), you can't lose. Some favorites: Singapore rice noodles, green beans with XO sauce, Spicy Ma-Po tofu, Salt & Pepper chicken wings, and an eggplant and black bean sauce dish (it's not on the menu but they make it for me).  Even the things on their American-style Chinese food menu are good."}
{"text":"I've literally driven by this place a trillion times and never once had the idea to stop in here for something delicious.   Sooo...Super Bowl Sunday, my friend says that we'll get some of the best wings in the Phoenix area. When he told me that these wings didn't have any of that \"sugary, BS sauce all over them\" I was both incredulous of his claim and sad. I really wanted some honey-hot wings!  Anyway, we pull up to this place and I'm like \"uhhh...when did we decide to get Chinese food?!\"   Blah, blah, blah...the wings are in the car and they smell DELICIOUS!! As soon as I had the opportunity, I tried one wing and it was over. I ate AT LEAST a dozen or 20 wings. They don't have any sauce on them; they are like salt and pepper chicken wings. Super, super delicious!!  I went back about a week later because I really wanted more of the wings. This time, I also ordered an orange chicken dinner plate (with the rice, spring rolls, crab puffs). I'm just going to stick with the chicken wings from this place. The orange chicken was dry and flavorless, had giant chunks of orange in it (no thank you) and the crab puffs tasted of old cream cheese with a hint of crab flavor? Not my idea of a crab puff.   Just order the chicken wings from this place! You'll fall in love!! Perhaps, the traditional menu has better offerings."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant many times and decided to stop by for lunch the other day. When my wonk and I went in, I was a bit surprised we were the only patrons. That didn't bother me though, I was just there to eat haha  Anyhow the lady at the counter/register is extremely nice and patient. Lord knows we take a while to make up our minds on what to eat, even when we exaggerate and say we're starving. So we ordered walnut shrimp and sweet and sour chicken.  The dish my wonk ordered was a bit tastier than the dish I'd ordered,  and his was recommended on the menu. I though the shrimp went very well with the walnuts. The dish I ordered had a good temperature and flavor but I started to feel sick the more I ate of my food. IT WAS NOT THE FOOD PREPARATION AT ALL. I didn't really like the way the chicken tasted. It tasted really poor quality, and it was mainly the bigger pieces.   Overall this place isn't horrible,  and it isn't the best, it's just a different type of food. Don't go here expecting Chinese or Thai because it's Honk Kong styled. That I know was my issue. I still feel the restaurant is a 3 star. The buffet was almost nonexistent,  and the menus could've used a few more photos to assist in ordering. Other than too high of expectations upon arrival I would say it wouldn't hurt to check them out, as for me and my stomach...were looking for something a bit different than what is offered here."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a bad restaurant in a resort city such as Phoenix. However, this place fills that niche. I went there with a date and had Westlake Beef Soup, Singapore Rice Noodle and Moo Goo Gai Pan. The soup was decent.The rice noodles were broken indicating that the cook did not know how to cook noodles without breaking them up. The meats did not seem fresh. The Moo Goo Gai Pan was very salty. We only took a couple fork fulls from the noodles, leaving the entire dish remaining on the table. When I complained to the waitress, she ignored me. She never offered a replacement dish and she charged me for a plate of disgusting, uneaten food. The Moo Goo Gai Pan was so salty that it was barely edible. I spent $32 on largely food that could not be eaten. On the way back to my date's apartment, she complained of a rumbling stomach. When I got home, I was immediately sitting down in the bathroom. Do yourself a favor. Avoid this place and head to the Desert Jade 4 blocks away at 32nd St and Indian School Road."}
{"text":"Local greasy spoon restaurant - buffet was great if you like chinese food. If you want a renovated restaurant this place is not for you. You don't pay for the chairs you sit on but rather good food."}
{"text":"This food was not amazing. I was fooling around on Postmates and accidentally hit the order button on my phone. Then I thought \"why not\" because I had wanted to try this place anyway. I usually order egg foo yong and sweet and sour pork to rate a new place. The efy gravy was flavorless. Efy was as weird as every other Phoenix Chinese restaurant. Sweet and sour pork sauce tasted like it was burned. I really should remove Postmates from my apps."}
{"text":"good spot to go to if u want down home chinese cooking. order from the menu. recently had tofu w/ pork and mixed seafood w/ noodles. they have a buffet that is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is low-key bad. The owner (staff) was rude, and unfriendly. I ordered Kung pao chicken, and it was the worst I've ever had..in my life. The chicken was questionably chicken, with some raw peanuts thrown on top of heaps of brown sweet sauce. There was no kind of spice to it, at all. Not even a singular microscopic piece of chili.  My husband had Shrimp fried rice, and the shrimp was practically raw, and the lady had an attitude when he requested white onion in his rice. The only saving grace was the chicken wings, cause they were pretty bomb. But not bomb enough for me to go back, cause they were kind of on the oily side too. The poor attitude of the owner (staff) solidified my choice to never go back there again."}
{"text":"Okay now, I love Chinese but this place made me question my love. First bad sign, the fish tank was dirty as can be and the fish looked dead (only fish I've ever seen gathered together in a pack in a corner). The serves was pretty terrible also, my friend and I came in and no hello no can I help you, had us waiting there and when we said excuse me, got a very face offish response . but we stuck in there, the place looked dirty and the people were rude but hey the food might be great. Wrong ! Let's say that again wrong! The food was terrible , and we bought food for a few people and they all hated it, matter of fact we had to go out and just grab panada instead so remember that. The chicken tasted uncooked and it was some cheap chicken, a friend actually got sick off it, shrimp was still frozen , they didn't even cook the shrimp for us. The noodles , rice , everything was sadly made with no care. I'm sorry but this place should be closed down , don't even try them. Now there are plenty of great Chinese food around better than this nasty place."}
{"text":"First off - for those using the iphone maps, this place is on the corner of 24th St. and Indian School Road - EAST of Jack in the Box.  Not west of it like the map shows.  As I read some of the low reviews, I have to laugh.  Umm...if you want to complain about the atmosphere, service, and hot and sour soup - go to PF Changs for expensive Chinese food.  Places like this are what usually are good indicators of authentic - I am Chinese so yes, I think I know what I am talking about.  What I got a big kick out of was the fact that they have a menu for those looking for americanized chinese food and then a separate one with the real stuff on it.  Hilarious!  Madi D seems to be spot on.  I ordered the Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) and Green Beans with XO sauce.  The rice is not your typical fried rice so don't expect anything else besides the salty fish (yum!) and chicken.  It was yummy and a comfort good.  The green beans were cooked with something that made them dif. so I suggest that again.  I spoke with the girl at the counter (mine was take-out) and she was really pleasant.  Overall, I'd need to try other things to be sure but so far, I am pretty sure this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything tastes delicious and portions were huge! This place has amazing quality, does not skimp on MEAT either. This is coming from someone from Toronto whom has HUGE options of chinese food downtown..... Lucky to have been passing by Whitby to Oshawa (to get my G license) and decided on some chinese food... Found one of the best spots. If I lived closer I would definitely eat here every day."}
{"text":"This was the most awful dining experience I have ever had. Low quality food.  First bite was disgusting. Couldn't bring myself to finish lunch."}
{"text":"New Hong Kong (as we call it) has been a family favorite for years.  Now we go often with our friends for our weekly Sunday night dinners.  It's a great family-run casual place that has authentic Chinese food at great prices.  When we go we have an order set that we like: the West Lake soup, Peking pork chops, beef chow fun (dry), claypot with tofu and BBQ pork, and the beef and broccoli which you can do with either American or Chinese broccoli.  They also have great chicken wings.  Other dishes that we like include the walnut shrimp and the salt and pepper pork."}
{"text":"Best wings I have ever had. Amazing orange chicken. Actually everything we have tried is great"}
{"text":"We have had take out from here 3 or 4 times and it is good and they do not skimp on meat or quality, but occasionally it has been a bit cold, which seems odd since I am sitting there waiting to take it home.  It is currently rated the number one restaurant in Whitby on Restaurantica which shows me more people need to do reviews in Whitby..LOL"}
{"text":"I would rather eat a diseased corpse than to set foot in here again. Dirty, scummy, sticky and a Chernobyl-worthy buffet of reheated, stale entrees. When the zombie Apocalypse comes, zombies will refuse this crap. County health department is getting a call."}
{"text":"Way old school. I did the lunch buffet, $6 and change including drink.  It was actually pretty good.  Yes there were a few times I asked myself \"exactly what part of a chicken is this from?\" but the flavors were good. I'm guessing about 15 different items on the buffet.  I'm guessing this place has been here for 10+ years, maybe double that.  Red cheesy Asian interior as you would expect in a place like this.  I like this place, so what are you going to do about it?"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my fiance after reading a New Times article about the best wings. The restaurant is old and dated, but I come to find places like this offer the best food. So we ordered the salt and pepper wings, let's just say these wings do not disappoint. They are deep fried to perfection with juicy white meat and the flavor was great. I will be back again for more!"}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit that tonight was my first time here, even though I've lived within walking distance for 5 years, because I assumed it would not be good. WRONG. Why is this place not more of a yelp gem?  (Actually, one reason I've never pursued it is because I think at one point the reviews were mixed up between this place the the place on McDowell. This review is for the restaurant on the NW corner of 24th St and Indian School.)  It was totally empty at 6pm on Saturday when I stopped in to get takeout. The woman helping me was very polite and helped me pick out a few things from the Chinese menu.   The Singapore noodles were scrumptious and I ate the whole order by myself.  The green beans with XO sauce were also tasty, although plan to use those more as a side than an entree (and as a heads up, I do not think they are vegetarian, though one might assume them to be; I think there is some diced dried fish in the sauce making it YUMMY but not veggie).  The soup of the day was described as \"rehydrated bok Choi soup\". I'm not sure what that means, exactly, since when is bok choi DEhydrated anyway? I don't think she thought I'd like it because it was more of a traditional Chinese soup, but I loved it. It was very brothy with ultra-boiled greens, some unfamiliar mushroom or possibly dried plum thing, and (I think) boiled peanuts. The broth had a slightly sweet quality to it, similar to Pho broth. I'm not making the soup sound that good, but it was. Just try it.   I had heard that the winter melon soup is great, but the woman told me that while occasionally they have it as a daily soup, usually you have to call a couple of days in advance to order it so they can prepare.  I'm so glad I finally found a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite among my family.  My parents and grandparents immigrated from southern China to the U.S. in the early 80s and they can be hard to impress with food.  They are particularly critical of Chinese food.   We've always met here for birthdays over the years, usually for my grandpa.  I've never come here by myself for anything else other than to have a big lunch or dinner from their traditional Chinese menu.  I know they have a buffet during the week and an Americanized menu but it's something neither myself or my family are interested in.   I'm kinda sad reading the poor reviews.  Looks like a lot of it relates to the Americanized menu.  If your feeling adventurous, try something from the traditional menu.  If my critical Chinese family likes it, I'm sure you will too."}
{"text":"Food is quite tasty.. Restaurant is pretty run down looking.   Had seafood (fish&shrimp) tofu soup. Good portion for about 5-6 people.  Fried tofu and BBQ pork clay pot. Very good.  Peking style pork. Nice and tangy.  Fish with bok choy. Lotta bok choy. Pretty oily, but ok. Monk pan fried noodle - oily but tasty."}
{"text":"The food was good however the place was a mess. Old and dingy, not the environment I want to be in to sit down and eat. The buffet looked sick, gross and old which is why I ordered al la carte. The general tso chicken was good, the sauce was flavorful and plenty of meat. The chicken was a little soggy tho."}
{"text":"New Hong Kong is our go-to for local Chinese take-out. The service is fast, prices are reasonable, and food is delicious. Don't be fooled by the interior; what the place lacks in ambience, it makes up for in flavor...so long as you're looking for something more than sweet and sour pork and sesame chicken. If you are, make sure you get the Chinese menu and avoid the lunch buffet and you won't be disappointed. The soups are delicious - the West Lake Beef, a blend of creamy beef broth, fresh cilantro, silky tofu, and slices of beef, is one of our favorites. Salt and pepper anything is a surefire hit and the clay pots, which come out popping and sizzling, are a fun divergence from the fare you find at every other Chinese food restaurant around. Skip the chow mein, which isn't much of a step up from the noodles at Panda Express, but the Singapore noodles are some of the best in town."}
{"text":"This is the best Cantonese restaurant in central Phoenix. Hands down. Just ask all the chinese families that eat here. I grew up in Vancouver Canada so I know a thing or two about chinese food. My Vancouverite mother, who thinks the chinese in Phoenix is mediocre, says \"this is pretty good!\" and decides that she will eat here whenever she comes to town. That says it all. We eat here at least twice a month. When I don't have time to cook we order takeout and it typically only takes 20 minutes from the time I call. It's delicious every time. It's nutritious. And it's cheap! I've never had the smorgasbord. We order family style, typically one dish per person, and share. Walnut shrimp. White fish and chinese veggies. Monk's veggies. The duck (half or whole) is meaty and moist! Vermicelli hot pot. Eggplant hot pot. Salt and pepper steak. House fried rice. These are just a few of our favorite dishes. If you can't overlook the worn out furniture, you're missing out because this small family run \"greasy spoon\" restaurant consistently serves authentic delicious Cantonese food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the filthiest I've ever visited in the entire world (and I travel frequently to third-world countries on business). During my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food, the steam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it, and the carpeting was full of stains from ground-in food particles. If that wasn't bad enough the buffet food was terrible, too.  It all appeared to come from frozen, restaurant supply entrees--very oily stuff with poor smell, taste and appearance.  During the 30 minutes I was there, someone at another table complained about an unidentified object in her noodles, while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.  This place isn't even worth the 5.99 +tax for lunch, even if it does include beverage.  YUCKERS to the core!"}
{"text":"Soup's not the same. Place kinda looks post-apocalyptic.   This neighborhood needs a good traditional Americanized Chinese restaurant. They used to be all over the place. Plenty of people -- now having gotten the pretensions of \"Asian Fusion\" out of their system-- would be willing to come back. They could do a steady lunch biz from the local office workers and be a destination for dinner, but they're going to need to spend more than $20 a month on maintenance.  First time I've seen a sign on a buffet line reminding people not to dish food up with their bare hands."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I have had dinner here many times and can say this is by far one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. I recommend going for dinner. Foods to try are west lake soup, the clay pots, XO fish, and of course the Peking duck. The staff is friendly and is happy to make recommendations and explain the menu. The inside of the restaurant is nothing extravagant but is clean and quiet. If you want good authentic food this is the place!"}
{"text":"First timers and this place was AMAZING. Would highly recommend, would drive across the valley just to go to this place."}
{"text":"..my original review was deleted due to violating Yelp's Content Guidelines or Terms of Services.  Not sure how, or why. I think you all should know how bad the food was here, and how dirty the establishment was inside before you waste the trip. I also made a point to note that being of a specific ethnic origin does not automatically grant you a superior palate which can taste food from that origin better than the next person.  Bottom line: The kitchen was a disgusting wreck when I was able to peek back in there. The food gave me food poisoning, and was hands down the worst I've had. It is hard for me to respect a business who doesn't respect their customers enough to sweep the floor-"}
{"text":"I couldn't leave the house as I had a teething, grumpy one year old and decided to get take out instead of cooking. I desperately looked at yelp for any Chinese take-out around the areas and came across New Hong Kong. The menu looked decent and decided to order the Chicken Balls, Chicken Fried Rice and Beef with Ginger and Green Onion. The girl taking my order over the phone was nice and took my order stating that it would be about 45 minutes. The food was delivered in about 30 minutes and was piping hot.  On to the food review. The Chicken Balls were fluffy and crispy with the chicken tender (they did not skimp on the chicken inside). The Chicken Fried Rice was good and piping hot. I really liked the Beef with Ginger and Green Onion as it had a lot of beef and the sauce was tasty as heck. The fried rice and the Beef with Ginger and Green Onion was a good combo.   I will definitely order from New Hong Kong again."}
{"text":"This was a great novel thing back in the day A Chinese restaurant that offered boofay Oh but the times they have a-change-ed And Hong Kong has not arrange-ed To keep up with their competition Or to make any change or addition To the way they've always done it So despite the fire that tried to run it  To the ground a few years back Hong Kong lingers, although quite whack, The ghosts of americhino lovers' past forays Will haunt this MSG pit 'till its dying days."}
{"text":"I went here on Christmas Eve for lunch because I was always curious about it. Plus, the Chinese food choices in central Phoenix are pretty sparse. I would actually give this place more like 2-1/2 stars. I liked the tofu and pork clay pot we ordered. But the pork and kabocha squash dish was waaaay too salty. I feel like it was a spice, not MSG, that was the culprit. Either way, I had to scarf down a lot of water every time I ate some. We also had fried green beans with XO sauce, which is pretty simple to make. I know they have a buffet too and judging by what I saw during my stroll, the food seemed like nothing special. I did crack up at the using a tortilla container for the steamed rice.   I could see myself going here if I was really craving Chinese food for dinner or lunch. But I'd get it to go rather than eat it there. The inside is the usual old-school Chinese restaurant decor with booths and tables. As someone from the Bay Area and who grew up in a Chinese household, I could definitely say I've had better. I know the owner is supposedly a chef with 30 years experience so who knows, maybe I went during an off day."}
{"text":"Average take out spot in whitby. Some dishes are decent and some fall short. They are open decent hours so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"They have an authentic Chinese food menu that is on point. If you're feeling adventurous try it out! The hot clay pots are delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband discovered this little treasure about 8 months ago through the food critic in the Arizona Republic, and this has been our all in all for traditional Chinese cuisine ever since. We have tried a lot of different dishes from the traditional menu and have not had ONE we didn't like yet. If you prefer more of a traditional menu, they have one for you. Soooo many delicious items so i won't name one....but do try the crispy wings. YUM! It doesn't look like much on the outside but the food and the customer service makes up for that. One of our favorite dinner spots for sure."}
{"text":"Small family owned restaurant that puts out some awesome authentic Cantonese Chinese Style Food.  We have been here so many times that we have lost count. Over 100x times maybe on the low side.  Our favorite dish is the salt and pepper chicken wings, these are the of the best dishes around. You will not have anything like this at any other place.  One of our other dishes is the salt and pepper pork chops, not spicy but great flavor.   The house special fried rice and the house special chow mein are also winners. The family also loves the Hong Kong Style Peking Pork Chops and Pepper Steak.  Their soups are also very good where we like the sizzling rice soup and Westlake Soup.  Great food, good size portions and good prices sets this place above most restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow let me start with the good things... The ice was good and the fortune cookie wasn't stale. Now the negatives...the cashew chicken was flavorless. the restaurant wasn't very clean and you could tell it needs work. Overall it was very disappointing and I will not be returning :("}
