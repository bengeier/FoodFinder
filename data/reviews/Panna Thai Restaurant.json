{"text":"Thai food is just delicious but Panna Thai makes it irresistible.   Food is scrumptious with good portions.   Ambiance is very private, mellow yet warm & friendly.   Prices are very reasonable (almost like Thai BBQ).  Overall ~ will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for good thai food, stop by. They  have a great Tom Yum Chicken soup, and my daughter loves the skewers. My favorite is the beef salad xtra spicy. The staff is VERY friendly and you get served rather quickly. They even deliver if you do not feel like going out.. This is our favorite place after soccer practice. I highly encourage you to give em a try"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I think the food is better than any of my other Thai food places...problem is it is far from me...probably a good thing because I would go there all of the time!  I think there dishes are very well done, tasty and to the point.  Servers are all very gracious and conscientious.  A nice place to go when you have a craving for Thai food!"}
{"text":"I was there a few days ago with a group of mostly asian friends, myself i would have never chosen to go here because I hate spicy food. The restaurant was very cute , nice atmosphere, the servers were efficien,but  to me the food was boring ( I guess because I had requested my food to be the least spicy as possible), however everyone in my group loved everything they had...."}
{"text":"After a long weekend in Vegas, we ordered take out from here and brought it to my friend's house.  The BBQ ribs were perfectly seasoned and tender. The wonton soup we had was chalk full of veggies.  Our only knock was the calamari - by the time we got home - wasn't crispy anymore.  Otherwise, it was fast, tasty and we will visit again."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Thai food and Panna has the best Thai I food in Vegas (I think its even better than Lotus of Siam (which I thought was good but not great).   I had their tom yum soup which was delicious.   The restaurant itself has a great ambiance and it looks very clean.  The service is also great."}
{"text":"Delish! Coconut soup medium and garlic short ribs at least 1x/week! They are great for take-out and dining in. Always friendly - always good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for Thai food. Their menu is huge! I love their crispy duck and summer rolls. The prices are reasonable and everything that I have tried so far was delicious. I also love that you can order online and then just go pick it up. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"I don't review much, but since we eat here a lot and we're crazy about their Crispy Soft Shell Crab, the Seared Scallops, Yum Tuna, Minced Chicken & Shrimp with Curry and Crispy Duck Salad, (among other dishes), I felt it was time to say something nice. The dishes are original and super delicious, with no added MSG, and the service is exceptional. Every meal we've had has been off the charts good.  My wife and I used to eat at a lot of different Thai restaurants, in search for the best in town. And although it's a bit of a drive for me and there are dozens of other Thai restaurants closer to home (some pretty good), we can't eat anywhere else anymore."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around the southwest area. The satay beef or chicken is to died for. Also, larb with sticky rice is my all time fav."}
{"text":"This is the worst thai restaurant I've ever been! we were there today for lunch and ordered lunch special , which is the mango chicken and it comes with a vegetable soup. I should say it was a mistake of mine not to pay attention from the very start, i thought it was a big piece of napa cabbage in my soup,  i did not really care about it, just sipping the hot soup and at the end, i found out that it wasn't  a napa cabbage but a big piece of TISSUE!I called the waiter and showed him whats in my soup, and his response was did you drop your tissue!!??????he thinks that I am a scammer trying to have a free lunch!!!!!##@#@@#@he does not seem to be apologetic and said i will come back and when he  returned he asked me, would you like another soup??#$@##@# The mango chicken was a disgrace. Please people, save your money and don't even try this restaurant at all! there are other much better Thais Restaurant in Vegas.!"}
{"text":"Easily best Thai food in Vegas. We had the bang bang shrimp (perfectly spicy), the duck noodle soup (wonderful tender meat), and the massaman curry (stewed beef is amazing). I've eaten their pad Thai and several other dishes and I LOVE all of it!"}
{"text":"Someone referred this place to me while I was in Vegas this trip so I had to try it. I was not disappointed! It was so good and so fresh! I had the ahi tuna salad (good amount of tuna, good amount of dressing, good to split between 4 people if you plan on sharing all your food selections) and sa te meal with beef (perfect flavor and perfectly tender, peanut sauce was perfect, egg fried rice was tasty). Other people in my party ordered the fish cake and red chicken curry. Didn't try the fish cake but they said it was good and I wasn't too fond of the curry personally but it may be be caused I'm biased towards the homemade one my grandma makes. Anyway, this place is must try for Thai food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really mixed reviews on this place,so I decided to check it out for myself. My wife was craving something spicy,so Thai seemed the perfect choice.  We ordered some pad Thai noodles with shrimp and a plate of medium spice curry with chicken."}
{"text":"The chicken pad thai was soooo good, with a side of sticky rice!! Def will go back to this place. Live 2min from this place"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there and the staff was quite welcoming ... We went there during the weekday in the evening after a long day of work. The place was clean, well decorated and thier presentation of the food was nice. Thing i didn't like was ... the wait on the food was a bit long. My friend brough her daughter so of course the little one was getting a bit ancy ... after the wait ... the food wasn't that bad ... i enjoy their salads!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place on that side of town. I really enjoy the atmosphere with high ceilings and a quiet ambiance. Try the desert - it's great."}
{"text":"I alway order delivery. This place is awesome. The food is always hot and fresh. I haven't had anything yet that I don't like. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes and were not greeted so we got up to leave and all they did was wave us goodbye"}
{"text":"Nice little shop, decent decor and ambiance. Yellow curry was creamy and tasty, one of the few places I have been too where you get more chicken than potatoes. Rib soup is tangy and tasty. Basil chicken is decent, pad Thai a little on the sweet side but still palatable. Giant glass of Thai ice tea. We will be back."}
{"text":"It's not too often I'm in this area of town, but when my nerdy husband wanted to make a stop at Maximum Comics one night I figured it was a good time to try a new restaurant.  So we made the stop at Panna Thai for dinner.  The interior is beautiful and would make a great date spot.  Great art on the walls, comfortable seating, an overall lovely atmosphere for enjoying your dinner.  I started with the veggie soup after being told that it was ok for vegetarians.  It was good- a light soup full of veggies- but I have the sinking suspicion that it wasn't veg-friendly.  Well, on to the next...  We had the summer rolls as an appetizer and I really enjoyed them.  Lots of veggies packed into the roll and the peanut sauce helped round the out the dish.  This might have been my favorite thing we ordered.  For our dinner, we ordered yellow curry tofu, tofu basil noodles, and the asparagus with shitake mushrooms.  The yellow curry was good but a little bland and really only consisted of giant chunks of tofu with a few potatoes.  I still enjoyed it- I just thought it could have used a little more oomph.    We asked our waitress which noodle dish she recommended and she suggested the basil noodles.  This dish was really good and I'm a big fan of Thai basil.  However, I think it could be a great dish if there were more noodles to match the amount of tofu and veggies.    I'm not quite sure what I was thinking ordering the asparagus since I'm not too fond of shitake mushrooms...  I guess I was just assuming there wouldn't be a lot of them on the plate.  Well there were a lot but I did my best to be a big girl and eat them.  The asparagus and mushrooms were fresh and this dish had a lot of flavor, but it was another thing I had that left me questioning if it was vegetarian or not.  Overall, I think this is a nice spot for dinner.  The atmosphere was great and our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Some of the dishes needed a little love (and please more rice!) but I still enjoyed my time here.  I don't think I'd make the trip from North Las Vegas just for the restaurant, but if I were in the area would come back again.  Heads up to vegetarians, they say they can leave the fish sauce out of what you order (whether you believe a restaurant or not is up to you).  Don't forget your coupon from restaurant.com!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal, bang bang shrimp was our fav. Date night ended with fried bananas and coconut sticky rice ice cream. Yum!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant but I am little reluctant to go back now. My friend was craving for thai food and I recommended to go this place.We had Tom yum soup , beef salad and Choo Chee soft shell crab. Tom yom soup, we added shrimp, tasted little salter than usual. beef salad , it was good but there was too much dressing which made the salad very salty. Finally Choo Chee soft shell crab came, it was fired soft shell crab with coconut curry and very very salty!! The curry on top was so salty that I felt like I was eating curry concentrate and my tongue was feeling numb from trying to eat  that stuff. I am not sure if they changed their chef, but food has been inconsistent from last few visits"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews to small businesses,  especially restaurants.   But this place consistently has the worst service I've experienced.   Have been several times but the most recent experience is what now leads me to say something.   The wait staff is horrible.   I walked in to place a to go order.  It was not busy at all.   No one at the host stand.   I looked at the menu (which i grabbed myself) and when ready to place order,  was waiting forever for one of the staff to take my order.  No one came over.   I finally just walked out and drove over to nearby Thai restaurant.    I've dined in a few times as well and the service is just as bad then too.  I hope they see this review and make some changes.  I'm sure I'm not the only one to have experienced this."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Its my to go thai joint. Food is yummy and service is an A+. Lunch prices are such a good deal and good sized portions. One of my fave's!"}
{"text":"Completely rude and terrible staff. Food is way overpriced for the amount that you get. I'd probably smile if I drove by and saw this place went out of business. Never spending another red cent with these complete idiots!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this restaurant on a Tuesday night. The ambience was very nice. We ordered the Pad See-ew with beef, Sweety Duck, yellow curry with pork, and coconut ice-cream. My favorite is the sweety duck, although it's a little fatty, but very delicious. the other dishes were tasty as well. We really liked their home-made coconut ice-cream. It has coconut shave and mango chunks in it, very creamy and coconutty. They also take the gift certificate from restaurant.com."}
{"text":"Though their food is flavorful, it is not fresh.  I was there 2 weeks ago and ordered a pad thai with shrimp and they served me rotten shrimp.  The manager was gracious and offered to change my dish but I felt sick after eating rotten shrimp so I wasn't up for another dish at that point.  They took the dish off my bill so there was no issue there.   I went back to the restaurant thinking if I don't order shrimp I would be good. Boy was I wrong, instead of rotten shrimp, they served me a young coconut that was not so young.  The coconut turned pink on the outside as well as the inside and the juice tastes bitter.  I didn't say anything as the waitress was giving dirty looks like I shouldn't have come back.  They served me rotten shrimp and had the audacity to give me dirty looks like it was my fault.  Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"FREE refills on the thai tea!!!!! They have a lunch special everyday I believe. Between 11-3! I always get the Ginger Ginger Ginger dish! Also comes with a light vegetable soup, small eggroll, and a salad (salad is just shredded lettuce...no dressing or anything!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Having lived in this area for almost 3 years & just now discovered this amazing Thai restaurant wants me to make me slap my forehead! Why do I keep on going to Thai BBQ all these years, ugh! I love Panna Thai! This is now my only & favorite Thai go to place. Restaurant is so clean & fresh, wait staff are so welcoming, attentive & friendly, big portions of food, very nice (food) presentation that they always served hot  & refillable thai iced tea! Woot-woot!!! I have seen Thai BBQ food & service quality go down the drain. One time, I got served with re-cooked chicken that looked & tasted nasty. They even get stingy with the thai iced tea refill so I stopped going there & with YELP's help - I discovered this place. My whole family eat here twice a week. Hopefully, they will try to excel more & keep everything consistent."}
{"text":"Delicious food; lovely, fast service; pretty decor; ice cold Singha!  I love Thai food and this is the best I've had in all my trips to Las Vegas. Will certainly return!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef salad meet was chewy the crab in the crab fried rice was imitation and clearly not fresh also rice has chunks of something hard in it prob shell from the can crab, now let's rewind the ordering process was very hard the lady could barley understand me not from her lack of English but because of her talking in the background to other staff she said it was busy out when I came yo pick up my order it was only a small birthday party needless to say I'm NEVER going back"}
{"text":"The fried rice was nothing special. The vegetable garden is sloppy like they just used the left over vegetables from every other dish and the crab wontons were the worse disappointment. The fried shell was soggy and the filling didn't have that wonderful cream cheese flavor they usually have. I don't think I can even give this place another chance. Such an unsatisfactory meal."}
{"text":"The dishes here are the closest I've seen so far to the original Thai food flavors. Lots of well seasoned flavorful food. Many of the options available on the menu are not present in other Thai restaurants in town. The service is very good. Our waitress made a small mistake on our order, but immediately apologized and gave us a complimentary dessert to compensate for that, which was nice and very professional.  Will recommend this place as the best Thai in town so far."}
{"text":"I love this place because not only does it have amazing authentic thai cuisine but it's not some hole in the wall with dirty bathrooms and horrible customer service. Which is all I seem to find when looking for a Thai food restaurant. The prices are fair and during the season they have delicious  sticky rice with mango. So worth the drive from the north side of town of which I live."}
{"text":"I LOVE SPICY FOOD.....They have the best BEEF SALAD and the CHICKEN YELLOW CURRY I ever tasted in Thai Restaurants... Awesome place...I work in the same plaza, so we order there all the time for lunch... I'm always leave happy when I order from there...=)"}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order, called the restaurant 10 mins after I placed it to switch something minor. She told me my order had already been picked up and on the way. 45 mins later my order showed up not fixed (we live 10 mins away). We usually eat here once a week and this will be our last due to terrible customer service."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to go every Sunday. People will ask me what Im doing for lunch and my response, \"I've got a date with Panna.\" Seriously though, customer service is absolutely great. Last time I was there, the lady had forgotten I had said no onions and was utterly apologetic for it, which was unnecessary as accidents do happen, but then proceeded to extend the hospitality by bringing out a dessert as an apology. I mean, even though it was unnecessary and very generous, you just dont get customer service like that anymore.  Oh and fellas, this little restaurant is hiding some of the most beautiful women I have seen in the desert to date.    Enjoy, XO"}
{"text":"I have had delivery from them around 10 times and they are perfect every time. I'm originally from San Francisco with the best Thai restaurants is the U.S., so I'm very picky about Thai food. They are always so nice and everything I order from them is spot on. This is my favorite restaurant in the Southwest. Good clean food."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and amazing food, I've enjoyed their chicken satay like 3 times and I will be going back for more!!! I work in the same shopping center so it's awesome to have them as an option"}
{"text":"I usually like this place. I put an order in online and it didn't go through so I called at 6pm and they said 20 min.  50+ min after ordering our order comes through the door, they sent it out for delivery. We asked for a new order, they checked it for temp and said it still felt hot. It wasn't good when it got home. Be honest with your customers... we'd be more patient and understanding."}
{"text":"We bumped into this place on a date night when we were going to play mini golf next door, and what a pleasant suprise. The food staff and service were amazing. We ordered a bottle of reisling which complimented our dishes very well. The food did take a little longer than expected but it was worth the wait. We will be back for seconds...and thirds...and so on"}
{"text":"Really yummy I would have the calamari and the the soup was delicious. The music is very relaxing and the bathrooms are really clean.  Also love the mango salad."}
{"text":"We went to Panna last week. We had dinner and ordered some take out. I love all of their food. The restaurant is clean, awesome owner and staff. I'm so glad my house is only 5 minutes away from this place. Yummy yummy yummy happy tummy!!!!"}
{"text":"BEST THAI PLACE I HAVE TRIED SO FAR.... amazing service from are server apple just great food most difficultly I will come back"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 4 stars it's because they are extremely understaffed. The waiters and waitresses work extremely hard and were very polite despite of the circumstances. Customers kept coming for take out and dine in and they lost some business as people walked out and cancelled their orders. I feel bad for the workers but they have great service and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here tonight for the first time because I had a restaurant.com certificate and was feeling like the comfort food goodness that is Thai cuisine.  When I walked in, the atmosphere was pleasant and quiet and the server was friendly.  I ordered the egg rolls, the tom yum goong, the pad see ew, and the red curry.  Everything was really tasty.  While it wasn't THE best Thai food I've ever had, it was easily one of the best places I've been to outside of China Town (though this place is sort of on the cusp).  My only (minor) complaint is that they didn't have the type of egg rolls I liked.  Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. This place is one of my fav Thai restaurant in town. The people are always friendly. They have a more modern decoration with a touch of Asia, very soothing. We love the curry fried rice and the panang beef. The egg rolls were good not great, Pad kee maow was delicious (even though I've had better). They put good servings on your plate. Overall they have good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and attentive. The chicken larb is one of the best larb dishes I've had in town. Pad see ew was good as well. Refillable thai tea is a nice bonus. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Traveled here for dinner with a group of friends.  Restaurant has a nice, upscale interior.  Service was prompt and relatively attentive.  The table ordered chicken pad thai, chicken and beef sate, chicken panang curry and pork larb.  Although I did not taste it personally, the pad thai was described as \"okay\".  The pork larb was pretty tasty, although the requested \"thai hot\" it was not.  Sate was above average, with the beef outshining the chicken.  The panang curry was unremarkable.  Overall, a pleasant enough experience, but there are many other Thai restaurants that I would recommend ahead of Panna Thai."}
{"text":"This IS our local neighborhood Thai restaurant.  We've been coming here since they opened years ago.  I'm surprised I didn't write a review as soon as I opened my yelp account. The summer rolls with peanut sauce are a great way to get your veggies in without thinking you're eating too healthy.  My favorite dish was the Thom Kha Ga soup, but now the Golden Cups appetizer takes that spot. The service is good & the food is prepared fresh and fairly quickly.  The atmosphere is great for a family gathering or meeting of friends. They are also great for take out. The best thing about this place is that they are willing to modify dishes to meet my husband's dietary restrictions due to allergies. Not many places will do that williningly."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my last visit to Vegas and was very satisfied. The food is delicious and the customer service excellent. You can order anything from typical Thai dishes to original creations, and can't go wrong. We had a large group so I was able to sample a lot of it, and loved it all.   Try the ribs for sure. The scallop appetizer is great, as well as the fried spring rolls with mango salsa. And don't forget to order their fried banana with coconut ice cream! It's not the typical fried banana dish. They chop it up and roll them into coconut covered balls, and the ice cream is something special too.  Overall a highly recommended place."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE!  The only reason I decided to eat here was because I received a special coupon from Restaurant.com -- it was not a coupon I purchased but a promotion Walgreens was running and I got a $25.00 gift certificate. During my lunch break, I met my boyfriend here and immediately saw an unprofessional sign which said they are no longer accepting the Restaurant.com coupon. I was instantly disappointed and I spoke to the waittress and said I had no idea it was no longer accepted and no where on the certificate does it say management may refuse to accept. Her manager cut in and told me she was no longer accepting the coupon. I said I didn't realize that but is there anything you can honor? She replied in a snooty attitude that she can't accept the coupon and it is not her fault and I can receive my money back from Restaurant.com. I told her I didn't purchase the coupon and so there's no money to be redeemed except for at this restaurant. I asked for her manager and she said the owner was not working today and I asked for his card so I can email him and she said she wasn't allowed to give out his contact information. I asked when he would be in so I can ask him about the coupon and she said he doesn't come in everyday and she has no idea when he'll be here. Throughout the whole time she was be very rude and pointing in my face and I told her that because of her lack of resourcefulness and inability to be polite, I could not eat here so she right away told me she can give me a coupon for $15 and I decided to take it and order some food. However, the coupon was $15 off a purchase of $50 and my boyfriend and I could not order enough food to equal $50. The food was good but I have had better thai food with definitely better service. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"When I first get into this restaurant, I like the way they design the set up and it looks very nice for the atmosphere as a whole. And the server greeted us very friendly. There is no doubt that the service is excellent in this restaurant. It is a restaurant that truly cares about the guest's satisfaction. And at the end, the boss gave us two tasty fried banana balls as a gift for our first time trying in this restaurant. Yummy yummy"}
{"text":"If you are in the area, stop by for lunch or dinner.  The food and service is surprisingly good.  There is always room for improvement, but they are still new - so, keep an open mind.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated - modern, clean with authentic Thai touches.  Check it out.  Also, they are open to your suggestions.  Asked to speak to the owners if they are available.  I had their lunch special, Stir-Fried Basil and Chili with Ground Pork.  It was good.  Also, I had their Thai Beef Jerky - that too was good.  I look forward to visiting them again and trying their other specialty dishes."}
{"text":"So far I've tried the ginger fish which is amazballs! Pad Thai, can't ever go wrong with that. BBQ spare ribs was good but nothing too special. Drunken noodles was kind of like pad Thai but a bit spicer. Spicy crab noodles was good. When I'm in the mood for Thai food I'll def will be back."}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible. Walked out of the restaurant after being sat at a table, and no one taking our food or drink order for 10 mins. The employees themselves were all sitting at another table talking to each other, barely making any eye contact at all. We were the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Their dishes are delicious and they give you a good amount of serving. They give you refills on Thai Tea as well.  Panna Thai also have a great crew."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times recently with my boyfriend. I've had the chicken pad thai each time; he's had the curry chicken and cashew chicken. We've both enjoyed everything we've had there.   The restaurant has always been rather quiet, which makes it a pleasant place for conversation, and is pleasantly decorated.   Not 5 stars because the service is a bit slow and the spiciness levels seem to vary drastically (\"medium' has meant both \"just a hint of spiciness\" and \"so spicy it burns.\"  Overall, a solid restaurant and one that I'll probably return to regularly."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family here on Friday night. Have to say I was impressed. We had a restaurant.com certificate so ordered a few dishes. Had the Thai egg-rolls, which were delicious. Lighter and flakier than a Chinese egg-roll. Had the calamari appetizer and it was really good. Little salty but I like salty, plus the sweet chili sauce with it was yum.   For dinner we had the Pad See Ew, Green Curry, and the Asparagus vegetable stir fry with Tofu. All 3 were amazing, especially the asparagus and tofu, it had shitake mushrooms in a brown sauce, that was just a great combo.   Now Pad See Ew and Green Curry are a staple for me when I eat Thai, so I can use them to compare other places and I have to say this is one of the best places in town. Beats Archies hands down for sure. Proportions were big leaving plenty of left overs.   To top it off it was really nice inside the place. Subtle lighting with dark woods and stone work, make for an excellent atmosphere. Could definitely bring a date here to impress at a cheap price."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here last week.  They seemed really slow. Out of the group of 6, I received my food last for some reason. After reasonable times for appetizers, they served 2 people their meals, after a few minutes another person, then another few minutes 2 more people... then after a LONG time, they came out with my food.  I'm not a vegetarian or anything, but after eating In-N-Out all week, I decided to eat a \"healthy\" meal. So I ordered broccoli mushroom with tofu. That could be why my food took a long time. I found it odd since most places try to serve a group's meal within a few minutes of each other.  The food wasn't too impressive."}
{"text":"Got to try this spot out over the weekend, and I am bewildered WHY we didn't try it sooner!  We have been going to Benjaroong since it was so close to our house.  However after trying Panna Thai we have officially met satisfaction.  Not only are the prices great, but the flavors were amazing and FRESH!"}
{"text":"Really great Thai food. High quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Very impressed by not only the food but the vegan options! Ordered the pineapple curry with fried tofu, no fish sauce added vegetables and the yellow curry which were both very flavorful and delicious! We also got the first actually good pad Thai since going vegan that didn't end up showing up with egg and fish sauce in it! Everything was very delicious and extremely pleased our order came at the established time and exactly how we ordered it! Will definitely only be ordering from this Thai place from now on!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for both lunch and dinner.  The prices are very reasonable.  The food is good and is a good value.  The service staff is very friendly and I have found this a good place to take kids, at least kids that know how to behave in public."}
{"text":"Great food. Good atmosphere.   I got the yellow curry with chicken and it was great. Lots of chicken."}
{"text":"This is me and my wife's go to place.  We love this place and order out all the time.  We get everything from the soups to the beef salads to Pad Thai, garlic short ribs.  The service for us is always great and the food is always good, we have never had an issue there and we've been going for at least the last 5 or 6 years since we discovered it.  Highly recommend.  They have great and affordable lunch special as well."}
{"text":"Surprised this place has 4 stars! The food wasn't terrible but being next door to such amazing Thai places that set the bar so high (Surangs & Corner Thai), you've got a lot to live up to. We got   Pork Pad Thai- spice level 4 no complaints here, was good !  Papaya salad - spice level 4 but papaya was really soggy with the sauce and wasn't sliced the authentic way, which really changes the texture.  Vietnamese egg rolls - the neon orange sauce was way too sweet, no spice at all. Not home made  Sticky rice - even though it's only a $2 item it's what I look forward to almost the most. This seemed to be really old. The second we took it out of the bag it hardened up and was inedible. ;("}
{"text":"THE BEST THAI FOOD EVER......... Wife brought me here I never thought I would love it some much if it wasn't so far from home I would eat here every day. Their ribs are AMAZING and there spicy chicken chowmain is the BOMB."}
{"text":"I think without Panna and their lunch specials -- awesome food if I may add, half of the nurses at work would starve. Just saying. :D  So thank you Panna for delivering your delicious, inexpensive, and convenient food to us!"}
{"text":"its ok.  visited on a tuesday night.  had the chicken fried rice... chicken dry.  egg rolls were good with the right amount of spice but the rest of the family's meal which was a bit of everything was all in all nothing different or unique than any Thai take out joints.  just ok.  service just ok.  price average.  lets just say not memorable."}
{"text":"I am so glad I decided to try a new Thai place after going down the street for 2 years. I wanted to find something that was better than \"just ok\" and dare I hope for even friendly service? Well I found that at Panna Thai and I not only highly recommend it but will return. Most amazing Garlic Beef, which has been hard to find out here in Vegas. I used to live in Thai Town L/A for quite a few years so it's really hard to impress me when it comes to Thai Cuisine. This place not only has great food, but what really stood out was the friendly waitress/cashier. She was running around doing everything herself and never broke stride, all with a fantastic attitude. The place was clean, comfortable and you know it's a good sign when you walk in and the place is filled with patrons native to the food's country of origin :)"}
{"text":"As always, food was great and on time! Pad Thai and sweet basil are always a must. And their Thai iced coffee too!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, good ambience, Best Thai place around this area. So many items to choose from, their lunch special BBQ Ribs is amazing...their crab fries rice is delicious, they serve fast, awesome service. Would recommend this restaurant any day."}
{"text":"We visited this place to day for the first time.  We were really expecting to like this place based on all the reviews we have seen, but we were very disappointed. The place has a nice interior and were greeted immediately and seated.  No one explained the menu, but we asked many questions.  We ordered the lunch special of Pad Thai, salad, soup and egg rolls.  Items came out rather quickly.  The soup first and it was probably the most tasty thing we had.  The main orders came next and they had forgotten my egg roll, but they showed up with them in just a minute or so after advising them.  They stuck an extra in there for the mistake.  The egg rolls were fairly tasty.  Our main entrees however were basically bland, no spice, no taste at all.  I could tell I was chewing something, but you really could not tell what. My wife also agreed that it was tasteless."}
{"text":"Like using Ketchup on spaghetti.  After much consideration, and a coin flip, we decided on coming to Panna Thai for dinner last night.  The interior was clean and inviting.  I loved the giant golden elephant paintings on the wall and their Christmas tree made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.    The service was fine as well.  The food is what deems Panna a 2 star joint.  We ordered the fried calamari and the pad thai with tofu.  Fried Calamari - Large rings of calamari were a bit tough and quite dry.  The breading had an interesting flavor that wasn't offensive, just not something I was eager to eat.  It was served on a plate of shredded lettuce, but much of the breading fell off, creating a swamp like pile of dusty breading, very unpleasing to the eye.  Pad Thai w/ tofu - The Pad Thai here uses a tamarind sauce, which tasted like Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and not much else.  This was like boiling spaghetti noodles, adding ketchup and calling it Italian.  The sauce was heavy, and slumped on my palate long after dinner.  Panna falls short of being good Americanized Thai food.  I prefer the authentic flavors found at other restaurants (where's the kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, galanga, etc...??)   Bottom Line: Panna Thai is clean and inviting with good service, but the food leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"First time writing a review. Here goes nothing.. I ended up ordering the Pad See-Ew (Medium Spiciness) and my friends ordered the Sweet N Sour Beef, Choo-Chee Shrimp (Hot spiciness) and Calamari for starters with a couple Thai Iced Teas. It was pretty slow in there so we got our food pretty quick. The Choo-Chee shrimp was really spicy. I would not recommend the Sweet N Sour BEEF, Stick with PORK! Pad See-Ew was a little on the sweeter side even when I ordered medium spiciness. Calamari was one of the highlights though, it just melted in your mouth and the breading was perfect on it. Overall, The inside of the restaurant was very clean and the service was great! With all that food it came out to $50, which is a little on the high side but well worth it.   Until next time.. Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is has been my thai food craving go too. My husband and I enjoy their lunch specials. They have a big variety of creative appetizers as well. The thai tea is unlimited (seriously? Amazing) I have yet to try the thai coffee but I will next time! So far my favorite dishes are; soft shell crab, yellow and green curry, my husbands fave is noodle that has real crabmeat but I forget the name. I looooove ordering their fresh young coconut juice served straight from the coconut. All of their fried rice is really good. This place is clean with good service. Authentic thai food. I'm glad this place is close to home :)"}
{"text":"I go here often with my family, usually on sundays after church. Service and food is always great every time we go. Never had a bad experience. One of my fav thai places!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the chicken fried rice or chicken skewers. Very quick and delicious!"}
{"text":"Not your typical Thai Restaurant. We tried the Bang Bang Shrimp and the Scallops for dinner and they were amazing. The shrimp was in a curry sauce. For my entree, I had the yellow curry with Scallops. I was actually pretty amazing by the quality of Scallops. They were not the small ones, they were the bigger - good quality ones. It was a bit spicy but it was perfect and complimented the side of rice that came with our order. I also tried their skewers and they were also really good. The place is really clean and modern unlike a lot of Thai places that I've been to. I honestly thought that this was just going to be \"another Thai restaurant\" but it definitely went beyond my expectations. Try this if you're craving for good and authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I am definitely give 10 stars if I can.. Everything sooooo delicious. Fun dining experience..  will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Picked up food to go for an evening in.  When I arrived, the food was ready and warm.  The Yellow Curry is by far the best I've had in Las Vegas.  The beef Sa-te is also delicious.  I'll have to come back to try out their other dishes and service!"}
{"text":"We're waiting 15mins for the table,but inside have a lot table was empty?we order water with lemon,but no lemon,soup is too sour and put a lot cream,taste notgood?high chair was shake?it's not safe for the baby"}
{"text":"Panna Thai has a really delicious menu, although we usually end up ordering the same things. Two of the best items are the seared ahi tuna and eggplant/shrimp. The service is good and we never have to wait long. The ambiance is also very modern and pleasant. So why only 2 stars? Unfortunately, last time that we ate here, my girlfriend paid for the bill with her credit card and left a generous cash tip. The staff then decided to take an additional tip from her credit card. This is straight-up theft. Unauthorized charges on an individual's credit card is a crime. Furthermore, it shows that the staff is not communicating. We still may go back for the food, but we will definitely be paying our entire bill in cash."}
{"text":"Ordered phad thai (extra spicy)/shrimp & spider crab/coconut curry. It was soooo delicious n tasty.  Shrimps on phad thai were huge and spicy was perfect.  Wish give us little bit bigger portions."}
{"text":"A good Thai place that is open on Sundays! I ordered take out and my food was ready exactly when they said it would be. Although I did not dine in, i did check out the dining room and it seemed very clean. The staff was very friendly and quick. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai lunch special it was about $8, this pad thai was made with a little bit of thicker noodle than I have normally had on Pad Thai. It could have had a little more flavor for my taste, but it was still really good. It comes with an egg roll, and a small salad. I had a thai iced tea as well which was PERFECT! I really liked this place! I will definitely come back again and try some of their curry."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the staff was accommodating and friendly, and when our waitress wrapped our food -- portions are large and we couldn't finish -- she slipped an order of saté in.  Icing on the cake, free refills on the Thai iced tea.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Will never go back to this place again.  My mother and I used to love this place. We would go all the time. We just went today for the first time in months and i don't know if they changed owners because it is not the same.  The waiters and waitresses are so slow!! The food is not as good as it used to be. The ice has a very bad taste to it.  We went with my 4, all under the age of 9, nieces. When they brought the bill we were all ready surprised because the bill was so high. We checked the bill and saw that they already charged us 20%tip!!!! We asked the waiter why and he said cause it's 4 people or more. That is so ridiculous I have never heard of that!!! Especially charging for children.  Which makes perfect sense why we had such bad service.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Every single time I have eaten here, I have only ordered the Beef Salad & the Monster (Shrimp Salad) every time!  I'm addicted to the sauce & the vegetables in the salad are fresh!  The fried tofu is the only appetizer I get cause it to comes w/ an amazing & addicting sauce.    One day I may or may not ever try something new cause for me, it's just that type of restaurant.  I love these two salads... strange, but a must-try!  Especially if you want to eat alil healthy.!"}
{"text":"Good price lunch specials with nice matching portions, ordered the yellow curry, pad Thai, and beef with basil.  Delivery took a bit of time but I assume that as average for southwest area. Around 30-40 minutes. But when they arrived super nice and food was nicely packed and hot.  Beef and basil was very flavorful and that was my favorite out of all three.   Pad Thai was decent, it was good but wish it had better noodles or maybe a richer sauce. But it's by no means bad at all.  Yellow curry I have had better and wish that it was less watery a bit more flavor lacked a lot of spice and the curry wasn't very thick.  Overall, I enjoyed their food and would order again. Great that they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money unless you like food like Panda Express. The satay chicken was hard and plastic like. You get what you pay for. Lesson learned"}
{"text":"Great Customer Service. Fast. Inexpensive. Delicious. Clean. Did I mention the customer service!"}
{"text":"A great place to go to. Stopped here for dinner by chance as I was passing by and tried beef/curry and it was delicious. The portions size are large enough to fill me, price is decent. I can't comment on delivery or anything but in terms of dining in it is worth trying."}
{"text":"So this is the 2nd time we have been here and I have to write how great our experience was this time!! Our waitress was apple she showed great hospitality and really made us feel welcome. Great part about it was that she used to work at arawan one of our favorite places before so we remembered each other. Ok so onto the food. Me and the wife started off our appetizers with the divine scallops man was it good!! Very well harmonized taste. It was a little spicy with an herbal Thai kind of taste to it. But wow we really enjoyed ourselves!! We also had the steamed dumplings mmm it was delicious. I thought it would have just been a basic dumpling taste but boy was I wrong it had so many delicious taste to it. So onto our entrees my wife got the seafood eggplant. The seafood eggplant was such a well portioned delicious meal. Came with eggplant, shrimp, fish, squid, muscles, bell peppers, & onions. I got the bbq spare ribs. Bbq spare ribs was fall off the bone good! Literally the meat was so tender!! Overall my experience has made me very happy with our dinner tonight. So please come here it's great and such a chill place to eat at!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered pretty much everything on the menu and it has all been delicious!  I do get sad when they run out of the mango sticky rice though, it is my addiction.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is very polite and accommodating.  The presentation of their food is nicely plated, even when I order for delivery.  You can't go wrong with the spare ribs, larb, pad thai, and mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great dining experience.  One of the better in the southwest!  I frequent the many Thai establishments in this area...and there are several.  Of the choices around, I give this place top marks.  Even before I look at the menu, Panna merits high marks for a great dining room and customer service.  The food is always good and they put a little extra into presentation.  Not that I care much about that at Thai restaurants if the food is good, but it's a nice change.    This is a good spot for a business lunch, or if you fancy Thai on a social outing but are looking for a little bit more upscale setting."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Nice and clean inside with AMAZING food and customer service. I had the yellow curry... amazing. My husband had the pad Thai, amazing. A couple starters both amazing and the desert was just too goood. Would recommend to anyone! Must try! And again the customer service was great, huge plus on top of the food being great!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai restaurant I've been to. Been here a few times & nothing has changed.  Interior is exquisite, classy ambiance, super clean, friendly servers, good relaxing music & most importantly, delicious food!  My favorites are Yellow Curry, Chicken Sa-Te, Garlic Short Ribs, Pepper Steak & of course, Pad Thai!  The best part? THAI TEA is fresh, authentic & REFILLABLE. I know, I know. It's crazy. They were even so nice to pour me a to-go Thai Tea for the road.  I LOVE PANNA THAI!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and got invited to a birthday celebration there. There were about 20 of us and yet the service was excellent! We ordered a plethora of appetizers and dishes as well as various drinks and honestly nothing was left out.  What was really shocking was that they gave out free refills for the Thai iced teas! We asked if this was complimentary but they informed us that they usually only do it for regular customers like us. Talk about getting on their good side!  Overall this was a great place to go for both food and service, the restaurant itself was very clean and tidy and even had a flat screen tv so we could watch the NBA finals. How did we end the night? Fried coconut covered bananas. YUM :D"}
{"text":"My first time ordering delivery from Panna Thai was exceptional! My sister and I ordered Thai Beef Jerky, Summer Rolls, Papaya Salad, and the Pineapple Fried Rice. I was shocked that even with take-out, our food was presented beautifully. As far as the taste, everything was phenomenal.   I am half Laotian, so I grew up eating the same cuisine and this has blown me away with both taste and service. It stays true to authenticity yet remains unique with a modern flavor profile. Definitely will be a return customer!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. We usually order take out but when we do dine in the service is always great. Our favorites are the Tom-Kha soup, the Asparagus, Chili Cashew and all the curries."}
{"text":"I took the family here for lunch today since we were in the area. I normally eat Thai once a week (at least) and I'm pretty picky Thai eater. I have my favorite Thai restaurant in town (Lucki Thai) but I decided to give Panna Thai a try. Let me tell you that we were glad we did since the food and service were excellent!! We had Beef Sa-Te (Satay), Chicken Tom Kha, Thai beef salad, and sweet basil chili chicken. I like spicy so they made it extra spicy for me and the sweet basil dish was outstanding!! Rich sauce and bold flavors and best of all, they used fresh red Thai chilies! Enough to say that It was spicy enough!! The soup was great as well, one of the best we have had in town and/or out of state. Our server (Apple) was cordial, attentive, and checked on us throughout the meal. We got to try also their fried banana dessert (on the house!) and it was delicious! I would definitely make the drive again to enjoy other dishes from their menu. I highly recommend this place to anybody looking for affordable, yet high quality Thai food. Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. This time I ordered delivery and I'm a vegetarian. I get pineapple in place of meat and they charged extra??? So ridiculous. Then the delivery girl shows up with no chopsticks. The meal had a pretty strong plastic flavor. And I FOUND CHICKEN in my vegetarian entree. A small piece of really old chicken. So gross I had to throw it away. Makes me wonder how sanitary their kitchen is if old meat is laying around. I would call to complain but they wouldn't understand me  hard time just taking the order."}
{"text":"Since we moved to this area almost 2 mos ago, every place we try here seems to be amazing! Honestly, Panna Thai might be the best Thai food that I have ever had! I lived in LA and San Fran as well, so I know my Asian cuisine! :) And they participate in the Yelp Order Online feature?!?!? I am so happy to live less than 1 mi from this restaurant n other tasty spots!!!!"}
{"text":"I work at the salon next to Panni Thai so I have had them for lunch for myself and for catering lunch for the salon many times. They have delious food (love the Thai pepper steak!) and the golden cup appetizer.   They are very sweet and always take great care of us! I highly suggest giving this place a shot, you will be very happy you did!"}
{"text":"I love Panna. We order take out from here at least 2-3 times a week. Great price for the quality, always consistent. Good service too, I recommend the half chicken half beef satay dinner. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BF regularly orders from here when he's at work. I get leftovers when he overorders- which isn't all that often, actually. The thai jerky and the crab fried rice are consistently good options, but I especially like combining the two. The dipping sauce for the jerky is awesome! They do have a $20 minimum for delivery."}
{"text":"Terrible place for Thai food all frozen our Appetizers we're cold we sent them back 2nd the Shrimp  pad Thai was cold and shrimp tasted fishy we decided to pass on them remaking our original  Appetizers the server insisted that they'll be better even after we told her we'd pass on it we were ok with just the chicken satee but she brought them back out  told us the chef made them all over again we didn't want to argue with the server so we said fine snd again tasted freezer burnt dry nasty bland We just wanted the check she kept asking if we wanted desert we replied No. Thank you just the check ! Very irritating  once again we Won't be back The whole experience was so bad from the beginning when the server kept coming back every 2 seconds we hadn't even looked through the menu we'd let her know 3 different times that alone should of been the first sign to the end !"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it did not go well. The service was friendly but when I got my take out home I found there was hardly any sauce on the pad se ew so it had no flavor. I had to make my own sauce and add it. Then I was enjoying my fresh spring rolls when I found a bug smashed on the piece of lettuce that was under them. Not very appetizing to say the least. I probably won't be back since both dishes I received had issues."}
{"text":"Ordered through door dash and estimated time of 30 minutes. Placed order and it said an hour - ok. Got a message saying it would be 20 minutes past that. So delivery was completely disappointing. we ordered pad see ew, massaman and fried rice - all level 8. They must have completely ignored that request as everything was zero spice. The three entrees we ordered came with a tiny serving of rice too... normally you get rice per entree. The massaman curry was the most pathetic thing I have ever seen - maybe three pieces of chicken and one potato chunk. All of the to go items were in different packaging and unorganized. So disappointed for the price definitely not worth it !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. Especially the curries they serve.. I love em all though, from spicy basil chicken to the spicy/ garlic eggplant. Hmm! The best thai food in town. I think.Will recommend. Staff is so Nice and courteous!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like or prefer Thai food but I really enjoyed the pepper steak! Cooked perfectly and packed with flavor. It was pretty spicy but to me it was perfect. My family was also happy with their meals. The Thai tea was delicious as well. The best part for me was the service. Our server was super attentive and friendly. Will definitely be back :)!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in Vegas!!! Make sure you order the pad Thai. Friendly service will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We came in at 9:45, they close at 10:00. I know, I know. The last customers...rude They were very welcoming and politely reminded us that they were closing soon. I ordered the Panang, as it's my standard Thai food order. It's how I rank a place. The best Panang I've had in Vegas  so far. Husband ordered basil noodle, which is their rendition of Drunken Noodle, or Pad Ke Mao. His standard Thai order. Best he's had. This is our new Thai Fave."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years and it's consistently good. The service can be slow during busy hours but the ambiance makes it tolerable. We love the Prig King, Red Curry with fried tofu and the vegan spring roll appetizer is great. Servers are always super nice and they deliver too! Bathrooms are always spotless which we live. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I generally always stick with Pin Kaow 2 as my go-to spot for thai craving in Summerlin....but Panna Thai has given PK2 a run for its money!  This restaurant is very clean and the decor looks brand new. Our waitress was new, a trainee, but she was very pleasant, conscientious, and a lead server or manager was basically over her shoulder the entire time making sure she was on point. Excellent service.  We ordered: -Riesling -Cucumber salad -Summer rolls (non fried) -Chicken pad thai -Masaman curry  The cucumber salad was my favorite of everything, and all of it was delicious. The vegetables were so fresh and the dressing was very light (rice wine vinegar and something else I can't quite put my finger on). I was in crunchy, cucumber heaven.  I will definitely be back to Panna Thai!"}
{"text":"My second time visiting here was last night.  Always order my favorite:  Chicken Satay $7.95 - These are HUGE. Feels like you almost get a full chicken breast with every piece and the peanut sauce is good!  Crab Wonton $5.95 - Not something I always order when out eating thai but I did here and they were cooked perfectly. I know they are fairly easy to make but I think everyone's had some pretty horribly cooked (burned, no filling, ect.. I know you're thinking of those bad one's right now) CW's and these are not the case here.  Pad Thai $8.50 - 5 spice & tastes like 5 spice. Comes with sprouts, carrot shreds, lime & peanuts on the side for flavoring as desired.  All three of these are plenty of food for two people (this evening it was me -starving & my preggo buddy & there were leftovers!).  The restaurant itself is beautiful. Large in size compared to most others & with a modern decor. I'd say pretty good choice if you're looking to impress someone & not break the bank here. Not to mention service is awesome.  Overall my favorite Thai place right now with service, price & food added up makes it well worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for dinner tonight thanks to a restaurant.com gift certificate.   Restaurant was clean and spacious. I'm used to the \"hole in the wall\" settings. This one has a nice laid back interior.   We ordered shrimp pad thai, sweet chili basil with chicken, and crab fried rice. Portion of pad thai was a bit small but the size of shrimp was rather big. Spicy chili basil with chicken was good, but didn't taste anything out of the ordinary.  Same with crab fried rice.  This order was huge.  The latter 2 orders we took home to go since both portions were more than enough for 2 people.  I would come back to this place if I were in the area, but I think I still prefer my usual go-to Thai place Noodle House."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The food is good but with service like pana provide their paying costumers even the best food in the world will taste like s**t. To the grumpy waiter - carma ia a..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and delivery was 15 minutes earlier than original quoted time! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch menu, everything was reasonably price and well prepared. My wife loves the wonton soup and summer rolls for carry out."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service & good food. Ordered the chicken curry fettuccine and shrimp panang curry. I felt our meal was just average, didn't really stand out to me. I was pretty disappointed because the curry was like soup! I like mine a little bit thicker consistency so i thought maybe this is just how they make theirs? But the flavor was definitely there. I like that their menu is very presentable and has many of the common Thai dishes i enjoy, that i would like to try next time. Probably pass on the curry. As for the thai tea, i saw on a \"tip\" for Panna Thai that it is unlimited thai tea and thai coffee..which sold me because no place ever does refill on thai tea. It has been a few yrs since that was posted but they may want to change that. Instead it is limited to 2 refills, still better than none!"}
{"text":"This place is great! the atmosphere and decor makes you feel very comfortable. When I first walked in, they greeted me and sat me right away. The waitress was very attentive and outgoing. She tried to spark a conversation as well as made sure our drinks were always full. I was very pleased with the service of this staff.   I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and was craving rice but did not want to order another entree since I wouldn't be able to finish it. A convenient feature they have on their menu is that you can order a single serving of rice which was what I was craving for! I ordered the egg fried rice single serving. My boyfriend ordered the pepper steak. We both ordered the crab rangoon for a appetizer.  The appetizer came out very shortly after we ordered and tasted very fresh. There wasn't a lot of stuffing in the crab rangoons, which didn't bother us since we ordered so much food. The only thing I thought was weird was they didn't ask for the spice level I wanted for my Pad Thai which came out not spicy at all. I would compare it to a 0 spice level from 1-10 scale. I prefer mine to have some spice but it didn't bother me because I could make it as spicy as I wanted.  The pepper steak came out with a generous amount of steak. We couldn't finish everything! We had plenty of left overs to take home!  They took our dirty plates as well as replace each dirty plate with a clean plate after each entree. I loved that they took that into detail in their customer service/server training because I feel, it makes me feel more catered to. The service made my first time experience here fantastic and I will be back again. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hand's down the BEST Chicken Pad Thai I have ever eaten.  Ever.  Clean dining area.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Great close thai place close to home. And they deliver! Can't wait to try again so i can try the papaya fries!"}
{"text":"Been there many times and Love this place !!!!   Everytime I go there I will order the panang curry (medium) with beef. The beef is so soft and the panang curry is always good !!!! Medium spicy is not super spicy but still spicy. Good :D  I will also order the Wanton with cream crab meat. It's so good !!!! Last time I went there with my bf's family and we had 2 orders of this. 1 order come with 6 pieces.  Their thai tea has refill which is really good !!!!  Service is good too !!!   can't think of anything to write now since most of the time i just have the panang curry and wanton with cream crab meat lol !!  aww, ok, the interior design and environment are very nice too. And since their food's price are not expensive at all. Why not treat yourself with good food and nice environment?"}
{"text":"Got the tofu pad Thai, good and fast service the food was good not something extra ordinary but tasty I asked for spicy but in my standards it wasn't really spicy, I will come back to check the lunch time special next visit"}
{"text":"Food and service at this restaurant was excellent! I will definitely be returning here very soon!! One of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas!!! Hands down"}
{"text":"After my perinatal visit I decided I was really hungry. I wasn't sure what I was craving, but I knew this side of town had a vast amount of restaurants that I had been wanting to try. I consulted with Yelp and settled on Thai food.   The restaurant was very spacious and clean and the host was welcoming. There was only one other table occupied as I came in at a weird \"limbo\" time of about 4pm. I ordered Thai coffee and Basil Noodles with seafood ($13.25) spicy level medium. I gotta say, pregnancy seems to have made me into a wuss when it comes to spicy food. Either that, or subconsciously I was not looking forward to the punishment that is severe heartburn. The portion was extremely generous, I would say enough for two people to share. I had them box up about half of it and had it for dinner little bit later. It may appear pricey to some, but it was an entree big enough to share. My total with tip was a little over $20..so not exactly cheap for one person, but as I said before, the portion and the quality justify the price. They did not skimp on the variety of seafood either.   Their menu has a tapas section with many appetizing options. I am only giving them a four star because I want to try more of their menu before I decide it is emergerd the best thai food eva!  There are enough items on their menu that I still want to try, so I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The ckn larb gia was fantastic. Nice and spicy. Full of flavor. It came out quick and hot.  The Thai tea was delicious.  The chicken pad thai was a little dry. Their jasmine rice is very fresh. Great atmosphere for a business meeting or an intimate dinner.  Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"We really don't try fancy Thai food places but this is right up the street and always catches our eyes. We gave it a shot and it was a fancier Thai restaurant. The items were over priced and the garlic spare ribs were hard and didn't have much flavor. The best part of the meal was the Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Great food & service! Scrumptious and delicious food. We will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to get Thai food! Usually delicious without a doubt but the service sometimes is hit or miss. I've had dining occasions where everything came out perfectly timed and had a flawless experience. I've also had experienced where the boyfriends entree came out before the appetizer. Then his pre dinner soup 5 min later then the appetizer 5 min later. THEN 10 min later MY entree showed up and my boyfriend was already done eating. They gave a 10% discount off the whole bill which was a nice recovery. She was also extremely apologetic which helped. Hopefully she learns from this mistake because this is a huge no no in food and bev."}
{"text":"Just great food.  The curry dishes are to die for!  Good service and attentive staff.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Celebrated the DH's birthday here. Tasteful decor, attentive wait staff, and most importantly, delectable food."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place and found this place!  It was the best Pad See Ewe with fried tofu I have ever had.  The egg rolls were great too.  My new go to place when I want Thai food.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stay away from here if you're on your lunch break, sat and waited 40 damn minutes for our food that  never came and was never started. Terrible service"}
{"text":"That jasmine rice alone is something special!! I love the ribs, chicken on a stick & the cucumber salad!!!! The food is always presented so neat & beautiful.  I'm convinced this place just might be addicting..."}
{"text":"This place is really good! When we go here we usually get their delightful noodles, crab wanton and chicken panang.  Their delightful noodles are so amazing it has thin rice noodles with tomatoes, green onions and amazingness. It is perfect if your looking for something light and not something very spicy. There crab wanton are one of my ultimate favorites. They are so crisp and always made to perfection. There chicken panang is good too but I sometimes feel it is a bit watery and should be a little thicker.  Every time we go here we always get the best service and the people that work there are very nice and take very good care of you.  If you like Thai food try this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like the decor, I like the people, I like the food.... but i wonder why no one ever visits it. Every time i go to the restaurant, My wife and I are the only ones there. SO I encourage everyone to try this place out. Its worth the money. If not, so the restaurant.com for a discount."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have a slightly unnatural Thai food obsession. And now..on to the good stuff  Came in with a party of four on a Friday around 5:30. Place was full I open tables. We ordered bang bang shrimp and spring rolls as appetizers. My fellow dinner mates said the shrimp was on point and the summer rolls were fresh. We also had the wonton soup and tom kha with chicken. I do not eat meat but I tasted both broths and they were so so so YUMMYYY..tangy and lemony. As an entree I had the green curry with tofu, which I asked for \"spicy.\" Seriously, they are not playing here, the curry definitely was spicy. My one complaint about the curry is that it was really lacking in the liquid department, which made it more like a tofu entree than a curry for me...still delicious though.   Service was just ok, the waitress seemed to be in a rush any time she came to our table.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally! Some descent Thai food. Been a few years since I was satisfied with descent Thai. Ordered deliverd. Will be back for some more serious dishes. All was good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dine in occasionally, but most of the time we take advantage of their delivery service. Sure, it's just a couple of minutes down the road, but you know how it is when you get lazy.  Our few experiences at the restaurant have been pleasant. We've never had to wait for seating. The service is always prompt. We've had the same waitress during each visit and she always has a smile on her face.  We've come to like their Chicken Pad See-Ew with Chinese broccoli and their Beef Satay dinner. It's more than enough for the two of us. The satay is always tender and well seasoned and the fried rice that accompanies it is quite flavorful. The Pad See-Ew, though it is one of our favorites, can be off sometimes. Most of the time it's spot on (the chicken is tender and the noodles are al dente), but there have been a couple of occasions where it has been bland or too peppery. But again, it's not all the time and that's why we continue to get it.   We have, also, tried their Garlic Short Ribs, Wings of Angel, Shrimp Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and Tom Yum Soup. Everything has been good, so far, so we'll continue to enjoy our friendly neighborhood Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"We got recommended by a friend so we gave it a shot  It is a bit further from Vegas Strips but it's worth driving and try. The interior is clean and chic. Service is warm welcome. Price is reasonable compared to the portion and the quality of food. Most importantly the taste is very good and considered authentic. I love the Beef sa-te, Spicy Crab noodle, fried banana. We definitely will go back and try more dishes. Sooooo yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Don't really leave reviews. This is actually my third and the first two were only because they were sooooooooo bad. But this place is absolutely terrific.  Ordered too much for 2 people but finished everything, because it was so good. The scallops were very tender and the sauce had a nice kick. The duck rolls were absolutely fantastic. Best I've ever had. Lots of duck, tender wrap, and the Julianne veges in it.. The chicken satay was cooked perfectly and sauce was nice. Had a squid basil noodles that was very very good. The squid was tender and the dish has a lot of basil. Finally had a chicken mushrooms and asparagus dish that again was fabulous. And a special shout out to Apple who served us. Friendly attentive and overall great service. Wish she didn't give us dessert on the house, which of course I finished.. Argh..  Can't say enough about this place, will be back again and again. 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Pumpkin Curry Shrimp.   Loved It!   Best Thai Restaurant I have been to with excellent service, great atmosphere, great prices and absolutely delicious food.  Pad Thai was awesome too.   Going back again."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food and a great atmosphere!  Family owned and operated! The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Great food and price :) thanks to nana our waitress, look for her.."}
{"text":"After several lunches, I have found this place has grown on me.  The flavors, the service, the ambience, and yes, even the price, are always on point.  Even the simple cup of soup served with the lunch special is delicious and comforting.  How does one make broth with vegetables taste like that? The next time I'm sick, I'm going to call in an order just for the soup.  The chili basil chicken with brown rice is my go-to menu item for lunch.  I like that brown rice is an option.  I also like the free refills on Thai iced tea.  I leave feeling satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Hi chose chicken fried rice, which was very good enjoyed the nice portion that they offered and the large pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place especially for dinner. Nice ambience, good food and presentation of the platters. The ladies are very nice, very polite and attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"Food is great and staff have always been friendly. The Pepper steak is delicious and they have it on their lunch menu which is great. The crab wontons are really good too. Pad thai / pad see ew is good too. Restaurant is clean with quality ingredients"}
{"text":"My experience here last week was mediocre. I split the beef skewers and shrimp appetizer with the table and both were well done. For my main meal I had typical chicken pad thai, which was nothing special. The thai iced tea, on the other hand, was amazing! This place has very slow and inattentive staff, and not the most comfortable atmosphere. All in all, I would order in from here next time."}
{"text":"Valentine is my fave and the BEST server!! This place has great food-ALL OF THE FOOD IS TASTY! I'm here for lunch... and dinner a lot!"}
{"text":"Easily the best quality Thai food in Vegas. The servers are very welcoming and attentive. The price may be a little up there but their creative food selections are worth it. I love the fish salad, beef pad see eu, crab fried rice, pad Thai, and Thai iced tea. Be careful with the spice level (as with most Thai places I suppose). What's nice is that the flavors can stand alone with or without spice."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai food restaurants in Las Vegas. We saw the reviews and had to try it out for ourselves to see what everyone was raving about. Now we know how good this place is! We were amazed from start to end with the service, quality, and easy to read menu with lots of pictures illustrations for those that never had Thai food could easily understand. I ordered the basil mint noodle combination and my wife ordered the Coconut  Thai shrimp soup which both were delicious and amazing. Our friends ordered the pumpkin curry which she said was really good and our other friend ordered the crying tiger beef which he said was no crying matter...lol  This place is a true gem and one of our new favorite places to eat at. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Restaurant is clean. They have great dish presentations. The staff is welcoming and friendly. Their prices are reasonable as well. We have dined here twice and enjoyed it both occasions. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Mongolian Beef is where it's at. Best Thai food we have ever had. Probably the only restaurant we will ever rate 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have tried panna thai a few times and I've never been blown away by anything I have ordered. I normally do pick up and they are pretty quick (ready in about 10-15 minutes)  The chicken pad Thai ($8.50) is pretty bland flavor wise but the spice level is pretty spot on (I typically order a 4 or 5 spice level). I have also tried the yellow chicken curry ($8.95) which is just OK. All of the items range from about $5-$18 apps to chef specialities and the portion size is pretty good especially for the price point.  I'm not in any big rush to come back but overall food was decent at a good price."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very elegant decor.  Had a craving for Thai after studying for finals so i went during dinner time on a Monday night. Not exactly \"A\" material.  Pad Thai (Chicken) 7.50 For a togo order it was a bit...small. Other places fill the whole box up but one section was left empty for a wedge of lime and ground peanuts, that section could have had a few extra strands of rice noodle! Taste wise it was...sub standard. It was missing a lot of spicy and strong flavors associated with Thai food. Sugar must have been on sale, bit into a large piece of scrambled egg and tasted more sweet then egg, or sauce, or spicy for that matter.  Yellow Curry (Chicken) 8.75 Piggybacking on the Pad Thai, yeah sugar was on sale cause there was more sweetness then anything else in this curry. Had slices of chili but no heat. Very weak curry essence. Strong coconut milk presence.  If this place was an authentic Thai restaurant it would get Zero stars. But they advertise as an Americanized Thai restaurant so for that they get the job done."}
{"text":"Food Is pretty good for Thai in the Western region of Vegas"}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinarily bad or good with this place. It tastes like what it supposed to taste like. My wife and I both got curries and we enjoyed them both, they also give a nice side helping of white rice with it as well, being that some restaurants will not offer free side of rice with curry. All in all, if we are feeling some thai, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, Tom Kha chicken soup beyond amazing!  Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"Always delicious,  good food, good service! Love the sate and all the appetizers. They have great lunch specials and oh the thai tea!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bang bang shrimp and soft shell crab and those are wonderful!! Love it. Little suggestion, should have some noodle with a bang bang shrimp. It would be awesome."}
{"text":"I go easily twice a month and am in love with most of the food, it's close to home as well, adding convenience to it's charm!  I always order the monster which is a grilled shrimp salad, one that puts me in withdrawal after a week of not having it..     Stay away from the scallop tamarind dish and the steamed dumplings, two that I can recall that aren't stars on the menu..  Soo my issues come from the service, and yes I know that service may be lacking in a Thai restaurant.. 5 years ago!  I think it's an area that definitely needs attention and if their food wasn't as amazing as it is I wouldn't set foot in there again.      Tonight the server didn't greet us just walked up with a miserable expression saying \"something to drink?\", when did we give up on saying welcome, or how are you this evening or nice to see you again..  He took our order by pulling a piece of register paper out of his pocket, unwrinkled it and asked what we would like, leading to a deep sigh once I ordered two courses.  Mind you it's 8:45pm and the door says open until 10pm.     We finish eating our amazing dinner minus the steamed dumplings, not that they knew of us not liking them since no one asked us if our meal was good at any point.  Then that wonderful server came over dropped the check and reluctantly offered to box up some left over pineapple curry and rice.  I never asked for the check so when he came back I said \"can we not get dessert?\"  He said \"the kitchen closed at 9:45\" and I followed with \"the door says you close at 10\" it was 9:48.. his response \"that's what time the restaurant closes\"..     I was annoyed at this point and suggested they adjust their sign, or at least give their guests the option to order at 9:45..  Why let sales walk out the door?  I spent $50 on Thai food and undoubtably would have purchased two desserts!  Unfortunately we will probably skip this restaurant next time I crave Thai food and start a search for my next favorite.  It's a shame because the food really is delicious."}
{"text":"So yummy.  this is my second time ordering from here on Eat 24. Everything is delicious. My favorites are the tom yum soup with shrimp and the sweet basil with tofu. Quick and friendly delivery girl."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan until today. First of all I know what chicken tastes like.  what I was served today was not chicken.  The server today no comments. My order was all jacked up."}
{"text":"The food was passably good. I would say not as flavorful as some other options in the valley and the delivery took almost 2 hours. But overall, not a bad choice for middle of the road Thai."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in town, Panna Thai always has great food. I don't think I've tried anything from their menu that I don't love."}
{"text":"I love the food, I love the service, and I love the prices. I use Restaurant.com to get a discount to this place. The Pad Thai is decent, The Panang is Awesome! The Pad See Ewe is good too. That is pretty much all I ever order, so I have no opinion on other dishes. It is not the best I ever had, but it is darn good and with the friendly and fast service, and great price, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great customer service! And if you want to experience authentic thai food this is the place to go, oh and the price is fair!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my friend here last night. Haven't really been a big fan of Thai food but really did like this place. Its a small, quaint place. We were welcomed right away and seated. They were not super busy but the place was adequately filled.    I had the duck salad very tasty. I love duck and had never seen it served as a salad so had to try it. It was served over a bed of spinach, not sure I loved that but the dressing was delicious.   I will have to try this place again!"}
{"text":"Everything was great! We ordered grilled chicken skewers YUMMY, BBQ beef salad BOMB, Tom yum soup Spicy sour and good! Pad Thai with shrimp, spicy eggplant wasn't too spicy it was ok!  Def will be our new Thai spot since it's close to home!"}
{"text":"The crab noodles are amazing!  The house wine is quite good.  Have had the pleasure of eating here several times and the service is great and all items on the menu so far were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai restaurant. Amazing service and an amazing staff. Located on Patrick and forte pache it is like a hidden gem. I would recommend trying the tom kha soup."}
{"text":"Ordered today and wasn't a big fan of what I got. The egg rolls were the highlight of the meal but the duck was very dry and didn't taste good at all. This was a carry out order so dining in could be much better but I probably won't try to find out."}
{"text":"It's not the best Thai I've ever had but it is fantastic for the price. I love when places like this have pictures of almost every dish in the menu so you can see what you're ordering even if you don't know how to pronounce it. The crab Rangoon is a great app shared among friends. I've tried a few of the interesting soups and the Chicken Pad Thai.  The staff is always friendly though their English isn't the best. I haven't taken advantage of their delivery services yet but it's nice to know they deliver since they're only a couple of minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Great selection on the menu. The food is consistently good. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I had the ahi tuna salad.. It was very good.. The dressing was a wasabi/soy sauce flavor.. I usually don't eat wasabi but it went beautifully with my salad. Nom nom nommm"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try and I was pleasantly surprised.  I've been back several times since.  I love the pineapple curry chicken and my friend loves pad thai.  His favorite part is that they bring you a tray with fresh peppers, red pepper flakes, and other fixings so you can adjust the heat of the dish to your taste.  We also mentioned on our first visit that we would have like some cilantro and they've remembered that request every time we've visited since.  Great staff, friendly service, wonderful food!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food but they literally mess up your order EVERY SINGLE TIME    Doesn't matter if you give your order in person or detailed instructions via online ordering, they can't figure it out."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots for awesome Thai food.  They are located near my old house and we frequented it at least 2 times a month. I am a huge fan of all of their appetizers, but their entrees make this place shine. I have tried many Thai restaurants in town, but this one still beats them all by food quality and price.  I love their pad see ew, it's hard for me to stray from that, but all of the other dishes I have tried are amazing as well. Ranging from their beef/chicken satey, crab noodle, fried rices, and soups, I can't find a single negative thing to say.  Definitely recommend if you're in the neighborhood, and if you're not, make the drive and see for yourself. Also need to mention, their prices are unbeatable.  Most plates are all under $10, you can't find that quality of food at that price anywhere in town!"}
{"text":"Went here after a friend recommended it and we loved it.  Took a restaurant.com certificate, which really saved some cash as well.  We were 3 of us, and ordered chicken satay and 4 entrees, and with tip the bill was $29.  The portions are larger than most other That restaurants in town, and the food was generally as good as Pin Kaow.  The chicken satay was excellent.  The pineapple curry was very good, as it had strips of shredded chicken, and a nice spicy bite to it.  The pad se ew was good, although to be honest, I think Pin Kaows is better.  That being said, it was still good.  We also had a glass noodle dish called Beautiful Noodle, or something like that, which my wife really enjoyed.  Overall, the service was good and friendly, the food was very good, and the price was phenomenal.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Fast, cheap, and the best Thai food I have ever eaten!  Can get busy at lunch time but it is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Panna Thai is a cozy restaurant in the corner of a strip mall. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is above average for a restaurant of this size and popularity.  The wait staff was fairly attentive and friendly.  I had the beef salad, which they do a little differently than most Thai places... the beef is done barbeque style, so it has a smokey flavor. Overall I prefer the more traditional pan-seared marinaded steak for this dish."}
{"text":"I just ordered 5 dishes. All were supposed to be extra spicy and only 1 is spicy. All the rest are \"mild\". It even says it on the receipt. It's really annoying when a restaurant can't get an order right. I live 39 min away and am not coming all the way back to have them fix it. Just wasted $60 on bland thai food."}
{"text":"So I am 6 1/2 months pregnant and have been craving Thai food. I was SO excited to try this place. I called and ordered A LOT of food. I ordered  Pepper steak Spicy pad Thai  Golden cups  Royal duck Bang bang shrimp Pad se ew beef Thai tea  When I called to order I had my husband there reading off that I wanted and he texted me what I told him I wanted because I wanted to make sure NOT to forget.  When I ordered the pad Thai the male and I discussed how hot I wanted it.  The food took an hour to come and it was cold, but I was STARVING so I didn't really care. My husband pointed out that there was food missing so we checked and it was the Spicy Pad Thai. I wasn't upset, shit happens so I just called and the guy I spoke to apologized and said they will make it and bring it right over.  Soon after I get another call and it was the guy that I originally spoke and who took my order and he said I didn't place the order. I reminded him that he and I spoke about the hotness of the pad Thai and he said yeah, but it wasn't ordered so I need your credit card number again. He said I will leave a note when you order again to give you something free and I said no thanks, I won't be ordering again.  The food is really good, but it took an hour to be delivered and then they accuse me of lying and won't fix what they messed up. I will have this resolved tomorrow during business hours... Guaranteed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So this is the 3rd restaurant we hit for my birthday dinner marathon.  =)  The food really deserved the 5 star rating, and I'd take 0.5 star off for the waitress failing to refill our water/tea.  Since I had to round it, 4 star it is.  The three of us ordered one appetizer, one salad, and two entrees.  Satay Combo - two beef and two chicken skewers grilled to perfection!  I'd say that Panna Thai delivered the juiciest beef Satay in town!  Yum-wun-sen (the silver noodle salad) - there were only 4 shrimps in this salad and no any other seafood.  I'd say this is seasoned to appeal to the locals since it did taste kind of  \"americanized.\"  BBQ Spare Rib - Fork tender and falls right off the bone!  The sweet BBQ sauce wasn't just poured on, it was completely absorbed by the meat itself.  Sweety Duck -  I have to give this two thumbs up.  I'd say we eat duck pretty often since we visit the Cantonese restaurants in town all the time.  The Sweety Duck is up there with the tops, if not, even better!   The decor and atmosphere are WAY better than the Noodle House 2 that's only one block away.  We'd definitely come back again!  **special thanks to Julie C. who recommended this hidden gem that's very close to where I live**"}
{"text":"The customer service was good.... But that's it... The foods were so tasteless I wasn't sure what I ordered. The fried rice was the only one that had any taste to it, the noodle didn't taste like much.... The tofu green curry... It didn't taste like anything and for the price I paid the portion was small barely any curry in it. And the Thai tea was way to sweet... I original came here because it had such good reviews so my expectations were high, but come on... Did these people pay you to write good reviews??? Did you actually eat the food????"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Yelp and it was prompt and the portions were generous! They also gave me a free Thai iced tea. I ordered the crab fried rice, pad Thai, and BBQ spare ribs. The meat on the ribs was fall off the bone delicious. The crab fried rice was LOADED with crab. Like there was more rice than crab which I think is great. Pad Thai was good, I'm not raving about it but overall I'd order again!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai & Massaman Curry both we're good. Delivery arrived when expected.  Left special instructions to call when arrive, which they did.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Wow what a incredible find I have been here a lot the food is fantastic I mean you can close your eyes and pick anything on the menu and it is 100% yummy and delicious I am telling you it's carzy this is the only place I have been to in vegas batting 100% all day everyday do you know the dedication that takes... I met the owner Joe he is absolutely an incredible guy if you don't eat here at least once when you visit Vegas you half wasted your trip ... yes the food is that good... .yummy"}
{"text":"Panna Thai is just up the road from my office and is a convenient lunch spot.   The food here is good - very good - and the service is always friendly.   I'm not an overly adventurous eater of Thai food, so I stick with pad thai, pad see ew or curry dishes.   All of those dishes are well made and flavorful at Panna Thai.   The wait time for food can be a little longer than I would expect at times, depending on busy they are, but nothing too terrible."}
{"text":"The good... This is the best Thai food in Vegas, period. Price. Decor.  The bad... They should cover\hide the storage area so customers don't see it.  I don't give 5 star ratings unless the food is really excellent."}
{"text":"What a gem I've found over on the west side! They have got the best pad Thai noodles around and an awesome lunch special! It's over at 3pm so if you can make it, try this place out! You won't be disappointed! Valentine has been my lunch time waitress the last few times and she is a sweetheart! All the staff is amazing though, very attentive and kind. I am a Loyal customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Every time I call they look up my number by my phone number and they have a history of my order. So easy and efficient. They're super friendly and they offer great customer service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Was amazing until they got a new chef (Feb '17).  I had 2 or 3 very unsatisfactory deliveries and insisted the next time we go for dine in.  Last night we ordered a couple simple dishes and the were all terrible.  Soft shell crab wasn't crispy, the batter tasted like a mouth full of pepper and was soggy.  The flautas used to be my girlfriends favorite; now she won't even finish half an order.  The pork jerky was undercooked (I'm at a loss for how this is even possible).  We ordered the combo basil noodle last night and it was horrific. The thing with this type of dish is because there are so many components with different cooking temperature you really have to know what you're doing...this chef obviously doesn't. The pork component was well overcooked while the shrimp were half translucent still.  I don't mean to be harsh here but this was one of the best Thai restaurants in the US for a long time and now it's just....pesh."}
{"text":"i dont even know where to start. THE SERVICE OR THE FOOD!!! OMG, service sucked and the food was disgusting. I walked through the front door and the chef and servers were just staring at me for 2 minutes before i even got greeted with a hello or how may i help you? Then we get seated and it was another 5 minutes before someone came and asked for our drink order. NOT TO MENTION..... this was during SLOW HOURS... it was 4:30pm in the afternoon.... the only customers at the restaurant besides us was another table of 2 sitting 3 tables down from me. We finally got a chance to order after 8-10 minutes. I ordered the chicken satay & green curry with beef and vegetables. The chicken satay lacked flavor and marinate but the peanut dipping sauce that came with it was actually decent... but they only gave you a tablespoon amount for 4 skewers of chicken. The beef green curry arrived and i was disappointed by the flavor. It was watery and it lacked curry flavor... and the veggies weren't even cooked completely.  ....anyways... i wont be coming back. the food was too pricey for the crappy service and poor quality food. I'll rather go to Archi's or Thai noodle house down the street!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out which was ready promptly at the promised time. We had pad see ew & egg rolls, noodles were alright, a big mushy & didn't have a ton of flavor. My husband & I both commented that it was \"just ok.\" The egg rolls fell into that same category. Had very high hopes due to the positive reviews but this just fell a bit flat for us. Maybe it's better when it's eaten in the restaurant?"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times so thought I should give a review. The food is very good and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"The decor was nice and exotic... food was decent. But the SERVICE OMG. We waited forever... and I had to go ask if someone could come and get our order.  They did not even give us anything to drink after we sat down.  I think the place is new, but seriously, if you wanna open a restaurant, train your servers. The whole experience would have been at least four stars if we did not have to starve."}
{"text":"Just ate a paper towel that was in my soup! I thought it was cabbage. I just walked out without paying of course. The waitress chased me down to apologize, but I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a staple of mine but not anymore. I have been coming here for approximately 3 years and the quality has steadily declined.  It used to be so good I would frequently drive 30+ minutes just to get it. The beef Pad Thai used to be the absolute best in the city--tender beef, perfectly cooked noodles and full of flavor. For about the last year I have been getting anything but that. I kept coming back thinking that the flavor and dish that I loved so much would be revived. Well, after receiving these extremely dry, bland noodles and beef today I will never come back here. Please don't waste your time and money eating here. Find some place other than Panna if you are craving really delicious Pad Thai because I'm sure you will be as disappointed as I have been over this last year."}
{"text":"This review is going to sound harsh, so let me preface by saying that I tend to review Thai restaurants based on my own opinion of the flavors in the food.  This means that quality of service, atmosphere, etc. are not necessarily going to sway my review much.  With that said, this place had GREAT service.  Even though I came in with a coupon for $25, I felt like a regular customer within minutes!  The atmosphere is very upscale, and easy jazz music fills the dining area.  Oh, and they do have good Thai tea.  Now on to the food!  I ordered the tom kha soup with chicken (khi), the papaya salad, and the green curry with beef.  None of these were very memorable or impressive, unfortunately.  I also think that they Americanize a few dishes to some degree, but not as much as some other Thai restaurants.  The Tom kha was sweet with no lemongrass or galanga root.  The over all flavor was quite Americanized, in my opinion, and there wasn't anything that really stood out here.  The papaya salad was vinegary in flavor, and otherwise not notable.  The papaya was very crunchy though.  The green curry was suggested by my waitress as her favorite curry, although she didn't seem very enthusiastic about her own choice.  The green curry was a bit thicker than a lot other places, however it was rather light in the flavor department.  It seemed more like a stew with coconut juice mixed in.  On the plus side, it wasn't overly sweet.  The beef was a little tough though. I asked the waitress if the sweet sticky rice with custard was extremely sweet, or just a little sweet... she said that it was too sweet for her, so I passed on the dessert.    Overall, I would say that it would be very easy to fall in love with this place if I lived in the area, and I didn't have a particular taste when it comes to Thai food.  However, I can't say that I can squeeze in that extra star for Panna Thai due to my picky, snobby opinions.  Sorry, Panna!"}
{"text":"All you can drink Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee?!? You can't get that kind of hookup nowadays. This is my spot!   My Thai iced coffee was strong and sweet, just the way I like my men -and- coffee. Ha. I swear they topped off my large glass about 4 times while I was there. I even left with a large cup to-go! You bet I was wired off my ass by the end of the night. No regrets!   Polite and helpful service with generous portions of flavorful Thai food - and the price is fair?! I'm seriously loving this place. Here's what we tried:  * Chicken pad Thai ($8.95) - extremely moist chicken with juicy noodles! It was super flavorful and a heaping size! 5/5  * Beef pad see ew ($8.95) - fat, phat, noodles done right! Everything was moist, seasoned well and the beef was also super tender. 5/5  * Chicken and beef satay with peanut sauce, egg fried rice and cucumber salad ($12.95) - we were able to get a mix of 3 beef & 3 chicken tender skewers. Great flavor. I also loved the peanut dipping sauce!  Get extra. So good. 5/5  * Bang bang shrimp appetizer ($8.95) - this was my least favorite dish. The curry sauce was a little lackluster, watered down and the shrimp flavor was off. My party enjoyed this appetizer, but then again they aren't as critical as I am. 3/5  * Coconut sticky rice with mango (mango sticky rice)($6.95) - a perfect end to an amazing dinner! I always feel like you need a special occasion to eat this, but man, I'll make an exception to have this every time I dine here! They make it exceptionally yummy! 5/5  I love the fact that they offer free refills on the drinks! That alone made me a strong believer. It's just a huge bonus that their food is also tasty and juicy! Panna Thai, put that on your radar. ;)"}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be amazing after seeing these reviews. I have ordered twice from here and both times it's super disappointing not good at all!! How is Thai food bland. Tom Ka soup tasted like sugar water w boiled chicken w raw button mushrooms (didn't know those were Thai) papaya salad is pretty hard to mess up but it's horrible. Waste of money so sick and was looking forward to this. Such a let down. Don't believe the hype!!"}
{"text":"The food is great the service was fast and friendly. I came at 11am no crowd, but what impressed me the most was seeing the entire staff sit together for a meal I'm assuming family ties. It's always nice to see the employees enjoying the food they serve speaks volumes"}
{"text":"Found this place through a buddy of mine..decided I would try it out and ordered delivery that took 2.5 hours to get my food..by the time the food reached my door it was cold and I had no interest in eating it..if you're lookin for Thai food go with Basil and Lime. They are much better and tend to take their job seriously as well as care about the consumer."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find a Thai restaurant with bad food, but to find one that is also cool and modern is just what we needed.  Plus: The food, the services and the location is amazing. Plenty of easy parking space available as well.  Cons: None that I could find so far other that they asked me like 25 times I wanted more Chai tea."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and each time it has been great! I food is always fresh, the customer service is always great. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is very clean. I usually go to thai spice or pho kim long but moving forward I will be going to Panna. I had the monster salad w/ shrimp, spring rolls and iced tea. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant on the Southwest side. My family and I eat here almost weekly and are never disappointed. Every time we come we have excellent customer service and food. Their Pad Thai is the best and vegan friendly!! Very consistent + yummy."}
{"text":"I like this place! I get the yellow curry (spicy!) which isn't as thick as I like it but it's still really good and flavorful. My husband is more adventurous then I am and he's never been unhappy with his order. The staff is friendly and very accommodating when it comes to special requests. The portions are also just the right size."}
{"text":"They have lunch specials here every single day, not just on weekdays. My go to here is the sate chicken skewers. Their peanut sauce is to die for! I wish they would sell it bottled so I could hoard it.   I went with a group and everyone was satisfied with their meals. The lunch specials were served with a good amount of food, not too much or too little. Sunday around noon was not busy and we got great service.   For dessert, I had the Thai sweet sticky rice topped with homemade coconut ice cream inside of a shaved coconut. Yes, you read that right. It sounds as good as it tastes too! Yummy!!!! It's not on the menu in the exact way I got it, but the waitress told us about it and we couldn't resist.   I need to go back here to try more items on the menu. I liked it a lot!"}
{"text":"I've been to many thai restaurants in Vegas, but this one is my favorite. Why? Because they have the best sticky rice and pork jerky! I can't get enough of that stuff. Reminds me of eating on the streets of Thailand. They also have a great beef sate, its hard to find good sate, a lot of times you'll end up with a rough, dried piece of meat on a stick but not here, its tender and delicious! But if you're in the mood for something simple, try the pad see-ew, really good, the noodles are cooked so perfectly. I love it when I eat pad see-ew and there's that frangrant smell of the stir-fried noodles, can't really explain it, but it smells soooo good!"}
{"text":"the best thai food in vegas hands down!!! their pineapple fried rice is to die for!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! I've seen this place a few times and finally decided to stop in for dinner, I'm glad I did. The food is great and all of the staff and servers were super friendly! I had the crab wontons to start, the shrimp pad thai, boyfriend had the Bbq pork soup everything was delicious, can't wait to come back again and try more food!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here...  I would always come here on a weekly basis because I used to live a couple of blocks away... It has a nice ambiance... Servers are very nice and attentive... I always order the Garlic Short Ribs, Beef Panang, Shrimp Pad Thai, Fish Herb Salad, Beef Sate and Thai Iced Tea to wash it all down with...  I recently visited this place over the weekend and the menu is updated with a larger selection with photos.  Over the years the place has gotten better and better."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his brother and I all ordered take out we waited a long time to get our food! The waitress was sooo rude she was getting impatient when we were ordering. Then we asked if she can bag in two bags and she gave us so much attitude. By the time we got our food we decided to eat there. We asked for water the guy ignored us then I asked and didn't even acknowledge us. Then he gave us our water finally they never checked up on us none of that. Then we wanted a refill and he told us to hold on with hella attitude. Then he goes to his coworkers and proceeds to talk shit and points at us. It was completely noticeable. And keep in mind there was no one else there we were the only ones. So it wasn't like it was super busy. When we were done eating the guy came up to us and said \"are you going to get your fucking food?\" And my boyfriend said \"we're done eating thank you.\" Then the guy said \"pick up your trash don't leave it here.\" Then I butted in and said \"it's your fucking job to clean up the mess if you don't like your occupation then quit.\" Then we walk out and he started pacing the window like he was going to come out and get us. Overall the food was great. But the customer service was shit! I recommend not to go there."}
{"text":"We like coming here as it is close to the house.  Whenever I crave Pad Thai and Papaya salad this is where I need to be.  They know we're regulars so they alway serve us well and give us complimentary desserts.  Sometimes they already know what we want to order. LOL!"}
{"text":"First of all, after waiting almost 20 minutes, I had to leave my table to ask for a glass of water. I ordered crab fried rice with no egg extra garlic. I also explained, I have a allergy to egg. When the plate arrived, it had lots of egg. I explained to Ann, the order was incorrect. Ann was so unbelievably rude. She tried to convince me that the egg needed to be in the plate even after I explained for the second time, I have an allergy to egg. Even after correcting my order, I waited  20 minutes after I was done eating for  the check  to arrive to my table.  Not once did they come by to pick up my plates so I just put it in the table next to me. Jump is the name of another employee there and honestly he was very professional and apologized then tried to encourage  me to come back. Unfortunately, first time impressions last forever and I will never come back.   Becomes of the nice guy named Jump I  gave a two star instead of one."}
{"text":"food awful, very spicy, waitress didnt speak english. ordered dish made me choke. they made me pay for it.  stay away dont go here. i will tell many, many people.  bad food, bad service,  may 22, 2015."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai place in town. Everything I have ordered tastes great and their lunch special is a great deal."}
{"text":"Food was satisfying, service was good, and dessert was delightful!   I have to say though... I've had same dessert twice, Sweet Sticky Rice w/ Homemade Coconut Ice Cream & the quality/ taste the 2nd time was not as great.  My Favorites: Fried Calamari - Parmesan cheese?! Yup & it was goood. Chili Basil (Beef) - Savory Pad See-Ew - Good Yellow Curry - Full of Flavor & Spices"}
{"text":"This place has finally won me over again! Despite of my last review I wanted to give this place another chance because it was one of my favorite places to get Thai food.   This time around I came to dine in during my lunch break. It wasn't busy which I appreciated because I was having a short lunch today. They had recently changed their menu so when I had ordered the \"monster salad\" the waiter looked at me clueless. It's now called the \"grilled shrimp salad\".  My salad came out as quick as I devoured it!  It was so delicious. It had just the right amount of spiciness where you can still eat it and not kill your taste buds. They were not cheap with the shrimp either. They put so much shrimp I finished the veggies and I still had shrimp left over. Writing this review makes my mouth water.. I want more! I want more! Lol"}
{"text":"Made a stop here for lunch today after checking out the reviews.  Lunch hour wasn't that busy and I was seated rather promptly.  The server was polite and provided the lunch specials as well as the full menu.    Their menu has the classics along with some unique dishes  (ie. Salmon nuggets, Chicken curry fettuccine).  After some delay I ordered the cucumber salad as a starter and the Sweet Basil Chicken with steamed broccoli (they offer sliced or ground chicken options which is nice.  Overall assessment was that the staff was attentive, flavors of the main dish needed some work (ie. Soggy and cold egg roll, watered down sauce for the Sweet Basil Chicken - some \"sliced\" pieces were stringy and varied in size, and the veggie soup that comes with the special is mainly cabbage while still bland). Thai restaurants run rampant here in the city, so I was hoping it would compete well amongst Gata Thai, Naga Thai, Weera and even Pin Kaow. A 3-star rating is a fair grade. I'll continue to save my Thai cravings for the Henderson area."}
{"text":"I've been to several Thai restaurants in our area and stumbled on to Panna. One word...amazing!! The Bang Bang shrimp with crab curry is out of this world! The garlic beef was filled with unlimited flavor. Best of all, our server Apple was so hospitable and gave us a complimentary dessert. The ambience is chill and the restaurant is very well kept. We plan on being regulars at Panna. Till next time!"}
{"text":"First time here and the pics looked great but as one reviewer states the food was kinda bland. Wife and I had 3 items: panang (beef) garlic shrimp and diver scallops. Presentation was nice but I really don't go to restaurants for pretty food ... I wanna fill my belly!!! I decided that this is not my go to place for Thai food but I wanted to try bc the pics looked so appetizing.... like I always say ... try it ... you might like it!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean place and food is delicious the only thing to work on would be service because it is pretty slow but I will go back for more"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food.... Absolutely amazing..  I've only tried a few dishes but I can assure you the Pad Thai..  And BBQ spare ribs are worth every calorie in every bite..  The meat LITERALLY falls right off the bone..  Also really enjoy the summer spring rolls with peanut sauce without mint...  The only thing that is a turn off is the estimated wait time for delivery...  I was told over an hr but called back to cancel and they ended up delivering within 45 minutes... I popped my car tire and hadn't grocery shopped so I was seriously starving..  Overall love this place...  If I wasn't so hungry I'd wait the hr  with no problem!"}
{"text":"I got a certificate off of restaurant.com for this place, so I decided to use it last night with my boyfriend and my brother.  We were greeted and seated when we came in. I handed the man the certificate and he looked at it and said okay. We got our water and looked over the menus.  We ordered chicken panang curry, bbq spare ribs, beef pad see ew, and beef pad Thai. Each dish was a medium in spicyness.   When we ordered, my boyfriend asked the waitress if it all comes with rice and she said that the ribs and curry did, so he asked her if it was enough for all of us or if we should order more rice. She said that we don't need more rice because we have the pad thai and the pad see ew and that's what you eat with the dishes. EXCUSE ME!? Who are you to tell us what we eat with our dishes? We're Filipino, we eat EVERYTHING with rice, even noodles! So of course we were a little embarrassed to even order anymore rice.   The food came after about 10 minutes. My favorite dish was the panang, sooo good! The ribs were really good also, so soft and soo flavorful. The pad see ew and pad thai were average.  The reason why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because of their service. No one EVER smiled, asked us how we were doing, or initiated any type of conversation. I saw some other customers come in after us and the servers started talking to them, smiling, and even laughing, so they're obviously capable of doing so, they just didn't with us. I guess it's just one of those places that already have their favorite customers and don't do anything to try and get people to come back.   Good food, poor attitudes = 3 stars"}
{"text":"I love me some Thai and this strip mall wonder is a thunder from down under, spicey as you want it, with a nice kick.   We had the beef jerky appetizer and it was perfectly done.   We also had a duck soup, mmmmm...so good, and the wifey had drunken noodles, she loves getting drunken and having noodles too...lol.   Really, this place is pretty hot.  Not 5 star for vegas, but a solid date night no less.   Off the beaten path, so quite quite for the romantic evening.  Staff as stellar on service!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery.  Food showed up 30 min late, was cold and they refused to address the problem and then blamed us and told us they said they were going to be late.  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Let me put it like this... if i was caught in the middle of the ocean on a deserted island and the only place to eat at was this restaurant.... i would most likely starve! :) simply put I've had better... Now! don't get me wrong; the restaurant as a whole is nice and the music that they play is very soothing an great!!! but the food not so much :("}
{"text":"Nice ambience! Location is convenient! Food is tasty! Very quiet and the prices are pretty fair! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This is a great resturant, the food is good and so are the prices. I ordered the garlic ribs and pad thai or whatever it's called and it came out to be under $25, so it's a cheap dinner place for 2. Friendly staff aswell."}
{"text":"We decided to come here since it was close to home and ordered the basil chicken and basil noodle both very good dishes.  Thai ice tea was my delicious. This will be added to my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the better Thai places I have eaten.  I like going here for lunch because they are fast, cheap, and the food is good.  Service is polite and fast.  I have been here four times and have never had a problem.  Every time I tried a different dish and have liked them all."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with some friends and... I totally love this place! The ambiance has more of a business casual vibe... Could be great for a date night... Or a business lunch :)    The servers were all very sweet and on top of the table. They made great suggestions for food and beverages. Our waters were always full and I never had to ask for another glass of wine :) (They only offer beer and wine).   They offer a large menu with lots of different veggie dishes! I was really excited about that! I ordered a red curry with lots of veggies! The spice level ranges from mild to extra spicy. I ordered spicy and could of definitely used more heat... So if you like hot... Make sure you are very specific. My friend ordered a yellow medium beef curry and loved it!! My other friends orders BBQ chicken with veggies and fried rice. Both said the chicken was really really good.   Dessert consisted of a chocolate lava cake with ice cream and fried coconut bananas with ice cream, neither of which I could eat... But the lava cake got some raving reviews!!   They have some really amazing lunches specials that I plan on checking out. I am really excited to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant ever!  We eat at this restaurant every time we visit Las Vegas and every dish is just heavenly.  It's a short drive from the strip and definitely worth the break from the casinos. I celebrated my birthday here with friends and family.   We ordered the works - appetizer, soup, beef, pork, seafood, noodles, dessert, and others.  Luckily we were a big group so I got to taste all the dishes.  I highly recommend the Pad See-ew.  It's very tasty.  The coconut ice cream with sticky rice is served in fresh coconut.  You mix the ice cream with the sticky rice and it is just divine!  Thank you Panna Thai for making my birthday memorable!"}
{"text":"Have dined in most of the Thai restaurants in Vegas and Panna stands out above the rest. Service is phenomenal, and the decor is extremely modern and well done. Now, I know some people enjoy the coconut type Thai food with the sweet tea, etc. etc, but I prefer the Tough Love from my Thai. Panna makes truly hot, spicy food that can easily bring a grown man to tears. I'm sweating a bit right now just thinking about it. So, if you like authentic hot spicy Thai food, Panna is definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to get some Padthai, I got a level of spicy on my food, never again. It was so spicy I can feel it in my throat for 30 minutes. But I have to say, when its regular the food is DELICIOUS. Will return again."}
{"text":"Overly delish food! The curry and pad thai was the best ive had in a while! The guy with the accent working the desk was super fun! He was very helpful and really entertaining while i waited for my food. Hey, he even broke my Thai tea virginity! At no charge :) Great place high recommendation!"}
{"text":"I rely heavily on Yelp reviews and this time around reviews failed me.    The restaurant setting is nice.  Service was so/so considering only 2 other tables and 4 servers.  Now, the food.  For Thai, this left me questioning where's the flavor!?!?  Ordered the garlic garlic shrimp and not only was the flavor lacking, so was the portion.  I wouldn't consider 8 pieces an entree by any means.  The chicken satay appetizer was decent but a bit tough/over cooked. On to the house fried rice...there was an odd sweetness and I couldn't pin it but based on the menu description I certainly didn't expect it.  At least there was a bigger portion with this dish.  Needless to say, this left me unsatisfied and wishing I had made the drive to my normal spot.  So much for finding a neighborhood Thai spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite Thai places in town.  First, I love the menu.  Lots of bright pictures to help you choose and overall great choices.  I tried the spicy crab noodles and while it smelled funny, it was delicious.  Tango salmon was another winner that I recommend."}
{"text":"There were two waitresses both very nice they greeted and seated up as soon as we walked in.  We both drank water. We got crab wontons... They were so good! Light and crisp with good amount of filling and crab taste. Sweet n Sour sauce with them tasted good.  Tom Yum soup sweet n spicy soup with mushrooms and shrimp was delicious. Good flavor, spice & lots of shrimp.  Cucumber salad... I HATE cucumbers for some reason but I tried this. It was amazing. So cool and refreshing with a lil onion in it and the dressing was nice. The cucumbers were actually great! I got basic chow mien with chicken... The noodles and veggies were good but the chicken was not. I should have gotten veggies only!  My bf got sweety duck. The sauce was good and it came with lots of broccoli. The sauce was yummy on the broccoli but the duck was very dry and pretty gross. :o(  Other than the meat everything was amazing! I'll def go back someday and try some more stuff or at least get the things I know I liked!!  They have a deal on restaurant.com, spend $35 get $25 off!"}
{"text":"ALL YOU CAN DRINK Thai Iced Tea!!   To be honest... that is one of the main reasons as to why I decided to try this place. I saw a review that said they had free refills on thai iced tea which I had never heard of at any other resteraunt... hahaha  Service was good although we had a girl that was still new I guess... she was a little hesitant but she held through very well. I'm sure she just needed a little more training on little nit pick information. We were greeted right away & seated in a half booth table. The decor was clean & not so cluttered with high ceilings which gave the place a very spacious feel.   The food was overall delicious & they have the pickled Serrano chili peppers which is always a plus for me when it comes to thai places =]  THAI ICED TEA $3 - FREE REFILLS!!!! when you dine in that is... i would have to say it is a little bit sweeter than what i am used too... but that may be because its free refills. ahahha you can seriously only take down 2 glasses worth otherwise expect a tummy ache!  PEPPER STEAK LUNCH $6.95 - I was definitely expecting cubed steak pieces but they were more thin slices... but the flavor was still good. Served w/ rice,  small salad, & an egg roll.  ROYAL DUCK $7.95 - this was actually very DERICIOUS. Its duck w/ cream cheese & veggies wrapped in a soft tortilla.   SATE BEEF or CHICKEN $7.95 - on the lunch menu... we got both for extra charge. Served w/ cucumber salad, egg fried rice, & DERICIOUS peanut sauce which i also used to eat my pad thai as well!!  DUMPLING APPETIZER $6.95 - steamed dumplings in the shape of a bag so it's definitely cute I would say. Served w/ soy sauce & 5 pieces.  DUCK NOODLE SOUP $9.95 - hubby got this & he got it w/ egg noodles... I never seen him eat hot soup so FAST   SHRIMP PAD THAI $9.95 - when I ask for spicy... I get it! Noodles are perfect & the peanuts come on the side of the dish. Even though it is spicy you can still taste the flavors.   MANGO W/ STICKY RICE $6.95 - ummm this dessert is like a piece of ARTWORK!! Seriously it is so pretty that you don't want to eat it! The rice was also a PERFECT consistency of STICKY & chewy."}
{"text":"While the satay was the best that I've tasted in awhile and the fried rice was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.  I drive over 30 miles each way to this restaurant.   Service: Is always on par  Food: I love that they've added tapas style plates. I get to gave several of my favorite things at once.  Be careful when ordering a spicy dish. We ordered most of our food medium or a #8 and it was really hot.  I drank more water and ate less food.   Atmosphere: It's a typical table and booth dinning, nothing special.  There is a television for those guys who want to stay up to date on their games."}
{"text":"We have ordered food here about 20 times. We usually have it delivered and had had nothing but great experiences. The food is SO good, arrives steaming hot and delicious. This is our go to Thai restaurant. I LOVE their curries. I've had masaman, yellow, red, pineapple with chicken and tofu with added vegetables. We always get the crab wontons too. My husband gets noodle or soup. Always delicious!  Update, 3/30/18 I still love this place. I just picked up food to go. So delicious!!!!! Just everything...so perfect. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just a pretty face with zero substance. Similar to an Australian male stripper I once met. Really nice to look at, but once he opened his mouth I couldn't run away fast enough. On to crappy Thai food.  I walk in and am instantly taken back by how current and sharp this space is. They spent money in making it look appealing and it does! They were also playing some current American music which was unusual to me, but I liked it. Only one table was occupied by a couple when I placed my takeout order.   The order taking was slightly awkward as I mentioned to the guy (because I am always entirely too friendly and can't help it. Unless I used expensive, yet bad moisturizer that is making my f*n face stink and the smell is killing me!), I mentioned that I have been dying to try this place.. He asked if I have ever had Thai food before. I wanted to ask him if he had ever brushed his teeth before. Again, I was nice about it. I placed my order for Panang chicken no rice and he then said,\" Medium or Mild\". I responded with,\"HOT\". He gave me the look, but than wrote down my order. I paid and he said it would be a few minutes.....  I don't mind waiting because I am in an especially good mood these days. The only couple in the restaurant pays and leaves. The music is turned off. The music never comes back on. I waited close to 30 minutes in silence for my order. I would have waited longer if I didn't get up and walk towards the kitchen. It had been sitting there for who knows how long. RUDE. I smile, grab my food and leave.   Immediately I open the container upon walking in the door since I'm ravenous for some spicy curry. First impression- Panang sauce is really watery..... Second impression- Panang Chicken has tons of Thai chiles, but zero flavor other than heat. No basil or kaffir lime leaves. No complexity or richness to the sauce. Only pure coconut milk taste or lack of. Dinner fail.   I really wanted to like this place and had hopes that this would be my new go to Thai spot for date night, but they just don't deliver on any level here. My suggestion is go anywhere else in the area for Thai unless you belong to a Coconut Milk Meetup Group or something. In that case knock yourself out. Literally."}
{"text":"We love Panna Thai! My husband and I eat here at least once per month, sometimes more we love certain dishes but also branch out. Sme of our favorites include the panang curry, spicy eggplant, and the coconut soup. I have spent three weeks in Thailand and know that their favors at Panna Thai are close to the real deal. We order it with lots of heat and they do sometimes under-deliver but I'd rather have it not spicy enough the way too spicy. The service is always great, the dining room is always clean, and the food is always fresh and hot. One thing we'd like to change is to have fountain sodas instead of the can... But oh well. We definitely keep going back and keep telling our friends and coworkers, too."}
{"text":"I order from this place frequently. Food is always good and delivery always comes decently quick."}
{"text":"Panna Thai is a hidden gem! Food is consistently great. I dine here at least once a week, usually get the Pad Thai or Spicy Basil Chicken-both are delish! If you want an appetizer try the crab wontons, satay skewers or the cucumber salad. Staff is friendly and attentive. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Satay is something rather ubiquitous in my home country of Australia. Being situated close to South East Asia we have quality Asian restaurants in the same way the South Western United States enjoys incredible Mexican food. Satay dishes are so commonplace that in Australia they appear on the menu at regular Chinese restaurants.  Living in Vegas now I've missed satay and even though Malaysian satay (my preference) can be hard to find, Thai satay is an acceptable alternative. Panna Thai takes that alternative and makes it in the best possible way.  Every time we go here I order the Satay Chicken as a dinner portion and both sauce and chicken are incredible. It comes served with egg fried rice and the standard little cucumber salad and is delicious from first bite to last. The chicken is exquisitely basted and marinaded and the peanut sauce perfection itself.  When my wife and I go here we usually enjoy the vegetable summer rolls as a pleasant, fresh appetizer to share and she raves about her vegetarian pad thai with fried tofu.   I've also ordered the BBQ pork noodle soup which is similarly tasty, but overkill when you're ordering a big plate of Satay.  Service is always attentive and friendly.  My only real gripe with Panna Thai is their lack of a fountain drinks machine and the requirement to buy cans of Coke (or whatever) if you want something non-alcoholic other than filtered tap water. This, of course, means no soda refills.  Overall though, Panna Thai is a great option. Their menu might not be as extensive as some, but they have more than enough to satisfy everyone."}
{"text":"Order from here at least once a month, great food, great prices, fast delivery! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is great but the average time for a to-go order is about 45 minutes. The restaurant was about half full and they seem to have a full staff on the floor which why I don't understand the wait."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. Everytime I order delivery always on time and accurate with my order. Food shows up hot and delicious. Panna is always my first choice for thai food. The Panang Curry is my favorite dish, if you get this get the combination you will love it. Wonton soup is some of the best soup I have ever had.  I always recommend Panna Thai over other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We order take-out from Panna at least twice a week.  Our go-to's are:  1. Eggplant & tofu skewers (love the sauce it comes w/) 2. Fresh veggie rolls w/o bean sprouts 3. Pad see eew no meat w/extra gailan aka Chinese broccoli 4. Cucumber salad - for our 20 month old 5. Coconut rice - for our 20 month old 3. Chicken wings w/Thai salsa  Love that we can eat healthy (minus the chicken wings), flavorful food while being semi-carb conscious and semi-vegan (ish lol).  The deliveries are always fresh and their delivery drivers are always super sweet.  Great service!  Hi Valentine, if you're reading this!"}
{"text":"We had a restaurant.com gift certificate that needed using, so we headed down there.  When we walked in the door we were greeted with smiles and shown to our table in a very nicely decorated restaurant with good atmosphere.  To start with, we both had Thai iced teas that were fantastic and refilled before they were halfway empty. We shared a bowl of Tom Kha Gha, which was the best I've ever had.  For entrees, we had the Red Curry with Chicken and Sweety Duck, both of which were fantastic.  The duck was moist with a nice crispy skin and honey glaze, served with steamed broccoli.  The curry had a generous amount of meat and the veggies were fresh and not overcooked.    Dessert was the house specialty: Mango with Sticky Rice.  Excellent, though it's seasonal, subject to ripe mangos, so take advantage in the springtime! Homemade Coconut Ice Cream is also on the menu, though we didn't get to try it because we were stuffed.  As mentioned in other reviews, the portion size is generous.  Neither my wife nor I were able to finish our entrees and it was packed up with extra rice to take home.  Excellent, friendly service, good quality food at a reasonable price in a nice environment.  Adds up to 5 stars to me!  Oh, and they deliver."}
{"text":"The food was 5 stars all the way! Tuna tartar appetizer is a must....egg rolls and dumplings are great too! Service was extra slow! There were only two young ladies working the dining room doing everything...I felt bad for them but this made our experience slow and long. We will eat here again....I think we will just order take out and enjoy at home!"}
{"text":"I will update this as I try more from here but last night I just ordered one dish.  They are my corner thai joint so I'm sure I will go back more.    I ordered the cashew stir fry which has dried chile in it but I asked for it spicier and I asked for broccoli with it.  Super plus they were very accommodating and didn't charge me extra.  The pick up was quick and easy and the portion was very large.  It was definitely spicy and there was lots of broccoli, my one side complaint would be that it had a bit too much fish sauce for a non fish dish.  But I will just make sure to ask them to tone it down on the fish sauce next time.  Other than that it was delicious and I quit enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp curry. It had the right amount of spiciness. It was fantastic.  So was the service! I love this place.  It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Very clean and beautiful! The food is great! (And I have experience with Thai food)"}
{"text":"Nice, light, well done Thai food. The beef satay and veggie pad thai were deliciousssss, non-greasy, and well-priced. The service was awkward - the girl spoke English but she had trouble with our order (there was lots of staring and awkward pauses) and we ended up with someone else's order on our table. The mix-up was fixed quickly and everyone was very nice.  I'll be back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Pad thai and Pad see ew. The mango sticky rice is also a must try! Staff are attentive. The reason I gave this only 4 stars instead of perfect five is because of the dips/sauces they pair with some of their dishes. Some of it just doesn't go well with the dish. But overall still a great Thai Restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were in town on vacation and wanted a quiet night in, so we had our dinner delivered. It was great. The Pad Thai was really good and the coconut ice cream was delish!"}
{"text":"Good food but pretty terrible service. It took 15 minutes for the 1st course then another 40 minutes for the 1st entree to come out. Overall not a good experience, they didn't even ask how the meal was."}
{"text":"Excellent service, attentive but not intrusive while while we enjoyed our evening.  We started with Thai ice teas which include free refills - unheard in Portland.  Next was two scrumptious appetizers - potstickers and I believe was called yum yum shrimp - shrimp/crab in a curry sauce - wow! Next, we ordered three entrees - BBQ chicken, eggplant with seafood, and chicken with broccoli.  All dishes were well prepared - eggplant was ordered with no spice, and all flavoring a were savored with each delectable bite - yummy!! BBQ was moist and tender, some so rare to find in Portland.  My friends patronize Panna Thai occasionally but this was my first visit, I will be back!"}
{"text":"The best MANGO CHICKEN!!! Very authentic and fresh thai food!! Everytime we order an entree we notice that they're not stingy when it comes to putting any meats & main dishes unlike other restaurants. Great service & a must try JASMINE GREAT TEA to wash off the whole meal."}
{"text":"Another AWESOME dinner at Panna Thai tonight! Great service and good food :P Thanks!  David"}
{"text":"I ordered on EAT 24 and it said it would take 45-60 minutes.  It took almost two hours!  The delivery guy was super apologetic which saved me from being really angry.  I ordered the following: Yellow Curry ( chicken) Pad Thai ( Shrimp)  And Crab Rangoons  The curry.... Was kinda bland.. I ordered it to be spicy but it has barely any flavor at all... The chicken was good though.  Pad Thai was delicious, but for an extra $1 for shrimp there should be more Han just four of them in the dish... That's kind of a rip off. The pad Thai was tasty though!  Crab Rangoons were great, full of filling and there were a lot of them...  I'll order again from here but I'll skip the yellow curry, and skip ordering shrimp"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. We waited for 15 minutes for water and our glasses were never full the entire dinner. There were two other tables so it wasn't a busy night. When the check came we paid and then they brought back a receipt with another amount. When we asked the waiter he said he had forgotten to add a few things an just ran it up instead of bringing back the revised bill. It's a shame the entire serving staff was so bad because the food was good. Ill stick to Archis."}
{"text":"My friend and I like this place. I think this restaurant is one of favorite tai food places in Vegas. It was very easy to find. My company had a yellow curry and a pineapple fried rice last time. Still so yummy!!"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE! We ordered; Lunch Specials  BBQ Spare Ribs= Lots of tender meat with delicious tastey sauce. Comes with brown fried rice and wonton cripsy (this is so delicate, pretty and very tasty not greasy) Sweet & Sour Shrimp=It's not thick & overwhelmingly sweet, just perfect, served along with BIG shrimp, cooked to perfection plump & juicy with bell peppers, onions (i hate onions but I ate these!). White rice  All the specials were under $8 and came with soup of the day.  THIS IS THE BEST SOUP I HAVE EVER HAD! It's vegetable soup which had some bok choy, baby corn and sprinkles of heave because this is the most delicious non-meat broth I have ever tasted !   Don't hesistate to go, it's delicious and everyone is so friendly. This will be a weekly visit for us"}
{"text":"Love their calamari! Tender in, crispy out. Not overcooled like many others I've had.  I love the pad see ew, and pad Thai. I try getting new things but I always find myself returning to the see ew"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Thai restaurant. Perfect for pick up or delivery. Dine in is ok ... wait staff is always friendly and we're never left waiting. Excellent coconut soup!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for supper last night. This place is close to where we live. It was my birthday and I just finished doing a 12 hours shift. Tired and hungry, wouldn't really care less driving to other Thai restaurants in the Chinatown area. It took a while for the two of us to get seated. No one was waiting in line, but the one hostess/server was busy serving the tables and taking take out orders. Hence the wait for a table.   We ordered wings of angel which was boneless chicken wings stuffed with a combination of minced pork and clear noodle, green curry chicken, pad thai, and duck noodle soup. The stuff chicken wings were excellent with just a perfect blend of seasonings in the minced pork and rice noodle. The duck noodle was also delightful. The soup had very nice flavor to complement the duck. The spicy green curry (even though we ordered it mild) was a little bit too hot for me. The pad thai was bland. Couldn't figure out why the pad thai (a staple in all Thai restaurants) was so tasteless. It wasn't until I got the bill that I found out the waitress put the order down with special instructions that said \"no spice\". No wonder it was bland.   I would definitely come back and try some more of their other dishes like the yellow and green curry. Well worth the money, especially since we had the restuarants.com coupon. When we arrived there wasn't too many tables seated, but when we were about leave the restaurant was quite full. Pretty good business for a Wednesday night.  I deducted one star for the pad thai."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. I will say that Pan Asian is my favorite but this place is a real close second to them! It's less than a half mile from my house so it will be a place I grab some to-go for. I had the spicy basil rice. Very very good. Lots and I mean LOTS of veggies, ton's of broccoli. Mushrooms and bean sprouts and fried egg and red peppers. I really enjoyed this. The portion size is tremendous. 4 people could have eaten this plate. My friend got the spicy tofu with pork. I was a bad girl and tried a carrot to see the flavor (she ordered a 10 on spice and I was worried), but it was real tasty too. Hers should have been hotter temperature wise. My came out steaming hot. We shared a cucumber salad and that was delicious. Chopped red onions and red peppers on top of cucumbers in a sugary dressing. YUM! Definitely coming back here. Service was eh. Nothing great, nothing horrible, but I do like a friendly waitress. Always rounds out the meal. But great food, huge portions make me a very very happy girl!"}
{"text":"This restaurant continues to deliver excellence. Tried almost every Thai place in the valley; this is the best. Warm service, pretty restaurant that maintains a pleasant, calm atmosphere. Great place for couples. Very clean. Food is really good and reasonably priced. Pad Thai, green curry, basil beef, chicken salad, Tom Kha soup, fried bananas for dessert, all top notch and cannot be beaten in Las Vegas. Servers are friendly and caring, chefs are inspired, owner really dedicated to her business. If you miss this, you will miss out on the best. It is our only destination for Thai in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried to order through Postmates but it was having some issues, so I called in my order & even though it was almost closing time they still took my order with no problem. Delivery was very fast and food was delicious! My bf and I had the lamb curry & panang curry.  We will definitely order from here again!!"}
{"text":"Went to this spot because it was close to the Putt Park. Sadly Putt Park was a huge let down, but thankfully the restaurant was YUMMY!  We ordered a little bit of everything. The waiter was great. We were pretty much the only table there which can lead to servers being all over you or nowhere in sight but not our guy :)  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"FAVORITE THAI FOOD!!! Omg! Where do I even start?!  Food- Awesome and Flavorful! We typically ordered spicy crab noodles and chicken panang curry! The spiciness is good and it's just bomb. Food comes out hot and fresh. We also get Thai coffee and tea. TIP: they have unlimited refills for Thai tea and coffee if you dine in  Service- Great and very personable. They get a lot of to go orders so just be patient with them. They are attentive. There's always just about 2-3 people on the floor so between them, phone orders and dine in it gets a bit backed up but it's a good sign since you know how much people likes their food.  Definitely always going to come back! Best Thai food in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the foods here I'm a fan of Thai foods and I have been searching for the best Thai restaurant around Vegas for long period. Pad Thai is alway the dish that I order whenever I go to Thai restaurant. Still can't find a best Pad Thai in Vegas but Panna's pad thai  4/5 stars is what I give for my pad Thai ( less sauce will be better) . I ordered : bang bang shrimp ( not bad , very interesting ,curry style ) , beef salad (the beef is soft,yum ) pad thai ( first time see green onion on pad Thai but good), and Tom yum ( excellent ) . Love . Will visit soon of course ."}
{"text":"This place was great and our waitress was amazing! She was so nice. The food was really good and we enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"I was so happy that The Original Thai BBQ (my favorite Thai restaurant) has a sister company closer to my place, so of course I had to try it out.  My family ordered: Tom Kha soup, combination Pad Thai, Beef Panang, & BBQ Spare Ribs, Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice, & Fried Banana (ala mode)  PROS: * Free refills on the Thai Tea... And they even refill it for you without asking them. That's a major plus! * Tom Kha soup, Pad Thai, and BBQ spare ribs tastes very similar (and even exactly) to the ones at Thai BBQ * Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice was delicious! * Serving size is reasonable & sufficient * Their lunch menu prices are awesome! $6.95 - $7.95, you can't beat that. Although the meat would be less than from the dinner menu, the lunch menu includes rice, soup, and an egg roll * The owners were super nice & friendly * Cute decor inside  [CONS]  * Unfortunately, their Panang was just okay. That was a major bummer since that's my favorite dish. It wasn't as creamy & sweet. However, the owner said that next time we order Panang, we can request for it to be more creamy & sweet (and even mention for it to taste like the one at Thai BBQ). So, I'll give it another shot the next time I eat here * Fried Banana had too much coconut on the outside. My sisters love coconut, but even they said the coconut pieces were overwhelming.. On the plus side, the vanilla bean ice cream it came with was yummy  Overall, it was good & convenient location."}
{"text":"I eat here once or twice a week. This is partially because I hate cooking, but mostly because their food is so good. It's also really reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Yes yes and yes! Coconut soup one of the best out there! No need for medium spice mild is just right! I fell in love with this soup in charleston sc and finally found a thai place who makes it just as amazing! Clean, great service and great food all around!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, such an amazing experience. Ordered Red Curry with coconut rice, Fried Calamari & Yum-Woon-Sen! Wow, the food is amazing!! It was a little busy when we got in, but the wait was worth it. Took about 10 mins after ordering to get our food. We will definitely be coming back again. My boyfriend & I love Thai food!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and I must say, it's probably one of the best meals delivered to my place. The presentation was nice, the food was delicious. My sister and I enjoyed it. We ordered the Thai beef jerky, summer rolls, papaya salad, and pineapple fried rice (next time will order spicy.) Would definitely dine here and order delivery again!"}
{"text":"Look, food was excellent. But the service was even better! Server name was Ice, he pays attention & handles business! Great food & service, place gets my 5 stars for sure, 6 if it were possible.   Btw, we had the chili cashew chicken, garlic string bean shrimp, & pad Thai. Everything was delish. Thx Panna Thai & Ice!  -James"}
{"text":"Best pad see ew in the area, I sub Asparagus for Chinese broccoli.  also the California garden rolls! Are so good I wish I can get this stuff in Chicago :( It doesn't  taste the same."}
{"text":"Good thai food and the service was very good and quick. We tried the lumch specials which seemed to range from $6 to $10 and came with the daily soup and eggroll. Also we tried the golden cups as an appetizer and they were amazing! If your in the mood for Thai food this would be a good place to try."}
{"text":"I'm actually impressed of this place, nice and classy decor, awesome service, food was great and at a fair price. I plan to be back here again :)"}
{"text":"We had an awesom Thai place in Japan that we loved, Sawadee. This place is a great replacement now that we're back in LV. We had Wings of Angel, Yum Woon Sen Salad, Chicken Yellow Curry and Basil Noodle w/chicken. All was very good and large portions. Enough for us 2 to be full on dinner and probably 3 lunches worth left over. We enjoyed free refills on the Thai Ice tea too; I mean where else do you get that? All for about $42. So dinner and 3 lunches for 42 bucks. Super Yummy, lots of flavor, big portions, cheery staff and very reasonable prices, what more can you ask? Get down there!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to see how good this place is. Everything I tried was delicious. Must have the pad Thai, spicy crab noodles, the fried rice, and deep fried duck. A hidden jewel in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"It was really, really good. And really, really close to our place. Which is why they get...5 stars!   Came in toward the end of the night, party of 2. We were seated quick...the staff and Chef (see below) were great and attentive.  Ordered:  Yellow Curry Fettuccine Alfredo...I know! Fettuccine Alfredo in a Thai place?!? Thats what made me want to try it and it didnt disappoint. Though I had to order a side of steamed rice to help with the spice, cus no i didnt have an option of choosing a spice level. But, I would order it again.  Divine Scallops....4 scallops on the plate. God, they melted like butter in my mouth...but again. It was too spicy for my like. So I ate some rice with them. Lol it helps!   BBQ Chicken....it was about 3-4 pieces of chicken, comes with its own rice. What can I say? Its a classic. It was great.   For Dessert: We werent going to order any however the Chef happened to be taking a breather while we were having dinner and after a good 15-20 minute conversation about work and life, to our surprise he sent us some dessert, on the house! It was.....  Banana dipped in tempura and deep fried, on the plate came strawberry sauce and on the side a large scoop of fresh coconut ice cream. Wow it was delicious and next time ill order it."}
{"text":"I've been going to Panna Thai since it first opened and it's still my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. I used to always eat at their first restaurant (Thai BBQ on Jones) when I was in high school and when they opened Panna my family would come here almost every other week for dinner since it was closer to home. I love their Thai Tea and I've yet to find any place that beats theirs. It's pretty sweet, but very refreshing and creamy. Their service is always great and their takeout business seems very lively.   Now for the food, I'll throw out a lot of recommendations but keep in mind I always eat in so I'm not sure how well things keep for delivery or takeout. For noodles, their Pad See-ew and Pad Thai are consistently delicious. I typically go for Beef Pad See-ew or Chicken Pad Thai. For curries, I almost always get a Beef Panang Curry because it's probably my favorite thing on the menu. You can adjust the spiciness to whatever you want too. If Panang isn't your style, I'd recommend the Green Curry with chicken. Other amazing things include: Herbal Fish Salad, which is a bunch of strips of crispy white fish with a unique vinaigrette on greens. Tom Kha soup with chicken, which is like a sour soup with coconut milk and mushrooms.   They have affordable lunch specials here too. I usually go for the Beef Sate (~$8) or the Garlic Short Ribs (~$7). The short ribs are packed with a lot of flavor in a garlic sauce and the beef sate is like three skewers of meat with good egg fried rice.  All in all, I've been to Panna a bunch of times and have never had a bad experience. They're very consistent and they make good Thai food as well as some specialty fusion dishes. It's a great place to go for large groups too. They serve beer and wine and have a TV if there's a certain game you need to watch. But seriously, get the Thai Tea."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised by my fried rice which was on the sweet side. I didn't really like it. Otherwise the curry was good."}
{"text":"Recently whenever I order delivery they don't cook the tofu. It used to be fried tofu and now it's just soft and has no flavor. I'm afraid to order delivery again since this has happened twice and it ruins the curry :("}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on Saturday night.  I ordered around 7:15PM.  My order confirmation said 45-60 minutes.  2 hours and 20 minutes later, after 2 calls to the restaurant to confirm if my order was coming or not, it finally arrived.   The food was good, I felt the portions were small compared to other Thai places I've ordered from.  I probably won't be ordering delivery from them again."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. They have amazing Thai tea, but the food doesn't hold much spice. Good if your looking for something mild, tho."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever tasted. Friendly attentive staff, service is top notch!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food, so it's a comfort to me knowing that I have a solid option so close to where I live. My boyfriend and I have stable orders we always end up getting. We got here an hour before closing so it was empty. When we first ordered some water, the waiter forgot. We didn't get our water until we got our food, but I'll just give him the benefit of the doubt that it was because there were no other customers and they were ready to close.   Panang curry with beef: Very creamy. It had a lot of flavor and good amount of spicy. My bf was impressed because \"it isn't broken and very smooth.\"  Pad se ew with tofu: I didn't realize that the tofu was fried and was cut into big chunks. I was't a huge fan of this, but my boyfriend loved it so I ended up just giving it to him. The noodles had a lot of flavor. The chinese broccoli could have been cooked a little longer."}
{"text":"Good food overall, nothing to write to mom about but maybe I need to give it a 2nd try one day down the road. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered some delivery food yesterday.  And I was supper disappointed. I order chicken pad thai. the order was so small that I thought it was just half of it. They also have bbq chicken dish with shrimp fried rice. there was no shrimp in that rice and wasn't good at all. don't  order from that place"}
{"text":"Another great meal at our fav thai restaurant.  Had the mango chicken this time an it was awesome. It comes witj white rice an the flavor is great. Its sweet an just enough batter on the chicken is perfect. Great portions as well. They never disappoint.  Great food an great service.  Also had my favorites crab wanton an egg rolls. Thank for another great meal."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite restaurant in town. I would give this restaurant more than five stars if I could.   Every time I dine in here, I never get disappointed. The foods here are so awesome. Some items you cannot find at other places such as Yum-Eggplant, Spicy crab noodle, etc.   Also, don't skip the desserts here. The mango with sweet sticky rice here is amazing. The chef makes it into a cute heart shape, and its taste way better than its look. You must try it !!! While other thai restaurant cannot offer sweet mango during winter, I must applaud its management that they are so good at sourcing ingredients and keep its good quality of foods at high standard all year round.   On top of that, I like the service here. Servers are always attentive. I always get greeting every time I enter or leave the restaurant. My Thai Iced Tea drink always get refilled (for free.) They are very nice and friendly.   Lately, I've seen they have more varieties of wine to offer. If you are a wine lover who like to pair it with Thai foods, then this restaurant would be your top choice."}
{"text":"Amazing people- amazing food!  Take-out or dine-in, it is absolutely delicious.  Their curry, ribs, BBQ chicken, Pad Thai,  and any appetizer is well with it!"}
{"text":"Was really happy to find a Thai place that delivers to me!! Yayyyyy! My prayers have been answered yummy Pad Thai delivered right to my door! It is not the best I have had but....it was very good that I ordered it a few times! I really liked the beef Pad Thai and the Crab Rangoon's were good too! Delivery is super quick and always fresh! Its convenient and good if your in the mood for some Thai! Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"We had it delivered to the house. The delivered almost 2 hours after the order, and the crab wonton they delivered were cold, and none of the food was hot. My pregnant wife luckily did not eat the cold crab."}
{"text":"This restaurant the food and the service are excellent. We considered this restaurant is five star. They have good parking. Inside the music is soft and wonderful to enjoy the food and to have a conversation."}
{"text":"So much better than Lotus! Bang Bang Shrimp and Spicy Crab Noodle are super yummy. Service was excellent and pretty quick too. Awesome lunch specials with good-size portions under $10."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood Thai place. Good serving size for the Pad See Eww. Worth the price. My new Thai place to go!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Always consistent. Love the atmosphere and prices. Thai Tea and duck soup, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I shouldn't have come at 4pm and expect too much. I ordered the basil pork. Some pieces were warm, some pieces were cold. The spring roll was cold. Oh, well."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here and it was still so tasty when I got home.  I got pad z ew and chicken green curry. Both dishes were very good, especially the green curry. I have had super milky green curries at other places which luckily wasn't the case here. I loved it. Nice rich flavor they immediately reminded me of my time spent in Thailand.   I look forward to dining in and exploring the menu some more"}
{"text":"Food is okay and everything takes forever. Appetizer took 20 mins to get here. If you have enough patience then it won't bother you that much. Just asked for my check 5 mins ago as we speak. Everybody works here is like in slow motion."}
{"text":"As I am reading the reviews here I am a little ticked off. I spent $ 60.00 for two here last night..  We Ate plenty.. I ordered the Thai Ice Tea and according to the reviews on yelp they give free refills on the Thai Ice Tea as long as you dine in..  I did not receive one offer for a refill on my Thai Ice Tea from any of the 2 or three servers that were handling our table. The food was good though. I would have given them 4 stars if the service was better.  I went back to this restaurant again and it was perfect. Plenty of Thai tea refills and great food. Service was excellent as well. The restaurant is decorated beautifully too. I will be back to Panna Thai."}
{"text":"I had a $25 Groupon about to expire, so we stopped here for dinner on the way to Town Square.  I had the Choo-Chee shrimp spiciness 3 out of 5.  My wife had the Garlic Garlic stir fry with chicken, 0 spiciness.  We had an order of fried egg rolls for a starter.  The meal was excellent.  I could have ordered a level 4 spiciness, but now I have an idea of their index of heat.  Andrea was thrilled with the amount of garlic with her chicken and the rich brown sauce with the chicken.  We ended the meal splitting the molten chocolate cake which was warmed.  I am really glad Groupon helped me find another good Thai restaurant and I know I'll be doing take out from here for the Garlic garlic chicken in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The inside is beautiful,  ambient,  and very clean. It's never been overly busy (which is nice because it's quiet).  Service is always great.   Food is awesome and spices are always on par with what you request.  The spring rolls are to die for. Also,  the Thai iced coffee with milk is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We drive out of our way to eat here when we are staying on the Strip. Best thai food that I've had in Nevada. Huge portions too.   The peanut sauce is made fresh to order and is the tastiest I have experienced.   The soup and fresh rolls are also good with evidence of  fresh cut veggies  Get the basil chicken medium spicy and you'll be good to go.  Service can be a pain during busy hours however."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (5 of 365)  I was pleasantly suprised by how flavorful and yummy everything we ordered was!  My friend and I came here over the weekend at around 3pm; so no one was in the restaurant.  We ordered: Pad See Ew Beef, Garlic Short Ribs, and Papaya Salad.  The salad was refreshing, the short ribs had a great crispy texture on it and wasn't too salty; just the right amount of garlic flavor, and the Pad See Ew was one of the best I've ever tasted!  It was full of flavor, had an abundance of egg which I love, and you get to choose whether you want american or Chinese broccoli.  Awesome!  The only downside was they didn't have any mango at the time we were there; and it's in season!  Not good.  I would have given it 5 stars if they had it!  But I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Date night with hubs.    Panna Thai is very cute inside.  Much nicer ambiance than your average Thai restaurant.    In addition, they have a selection of wine and beer.  Also, exceeded my expectations for a Thai place.  We had San Miguel.  Dark and tasty.  No cold glasses though. Boo.  Started with two apps: Wings of angel and royal duck.  The names are a bit whimsical.  The wings are stuffed with glass noodles, and ground pork then fried ultra light and crispy. Very good!  The royal duck was a really pretty presentation.  It was rolled in a tortilla/crepe thing and served with a way to sweet BBQish sauce.  We just thought it needed salt and spice.  Also, the duck was tough.   Ordered two entrees: Choo-chee shrimp and Pad see-ew noodles with beef.  The shrimp were in a flavorful spicy red curry sauce with keffir leaves, served with rice.  They were good.  The noodles were chow- fun esque.  We ordered a 6 for the spice and they were HOT! We were sweatin' but it hurts so good!  The portions were generous and the prices fair.  We had 3 beers, 2 apps, and 2 entrees....bill was $55.  A lovely dinner. We will go again for sure."}
{"text":"Panna Thai is my  favorite Thai restaurant in Southwest Vegas. Been to many of them in China Town and this one ranks right up there for quality of food and prices not too bad. Like it better than the popular and pricier Archie's Bistro. Panna Thai's atmosphere  is very nice and service is very good. Understanding English is a little bit of an issue with one or two of the servers but they try hard and are very nice.   Only small gripes is that the appetizer comes out at same time, or even later than the main course. Only pick from mild, medium and hot. Medium not very spicy.   On the dinner receipt, if u spend enough they print a 20% off coupon for next dinner. It expires in 30 days and don't be a day late though, they won't take it..."}
{"text":"Delivery took over an hour, the food was cold and low quality. Fried rice tasted like cardboard. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I had Tuna tata and golden cup for appetizer it was really good. And I had Pink noodle soup for main course. I told the server that I wanted spicy less sweet and I got exactly what I requested.  Also excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Only been here a couple of times, but it is new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. Very reasonably priced. Favorite dished Shrimp Pad Thai and Garlic Eggplant with Fried Tofu"}
{"text":"First time here, this place is very nice, nice atmosphere, ambiance plus the food was delicious. This place is right around the corner from our home we will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"While I was a bit surprised that Pad Thai is not on the lunch special menu it is easily one of my favorite places to go for lunch.  Service is generally fast enough for an hour lunch and the $8 specials have decent variety.  My fav is the yellow curry, though everything I have tried has been tasty.  Also, I love the decor."}
{"text":"I dream about their Pad Woon Sen, that is their silver noodle dish with shrimp, pork, vermicelli, veges and sauce. Let me tell you about the sauce, it's a great balance of sweet, salty, sour and spicy which are the basis for most Thai dishes.   Their tea is also really good quality Jasmine tea bags. I liked it so much, I took a picture so I can look for the brand and but it for home.   Service is good because they kept filling out water and removed our dishes when needed."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai place in Las Vegas. I got the Basil Chicken Chow Mein spicy, it was amazingly good. The wife ate the Mango sticky rice and loved it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with their spice level at all. I got a 5 for extra spicy and it was nearly even a kick. The Pad Thai was soggy and not good flavor sadly. The chicken salad was great along with the Chai Tea. I was hoping to have another fave Thai place but I'll be sticking to my #1 fave."}
{"text":"This is a regular for us for my son. We're near this location twice a week and he gets the same thing - Pad See Ew. I've also tried the tofu with garlic eggplant. Both of these we highly recommend. My son gets it medium spicy and it's good. The one time we ordered green beans, we were disappointed because it wasn't what we're used to. It tasted more like a soy gravy over green beans than a Thai green bean.  It's definitely good."}
{"text":"Panama is our go-to Friday night delivery. The food is always excellent and the drivers are friendly, and personable!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for many years but the manager is so rude! We are having a baptismal event and hoping they can accommodate us but this manager is just manager is just plain rude & doesn't want to accommodate our party. We are giving him business but he was flat out rude & inconsiderate of people canceling on us. So disappointed"}
{"text":"LOVE PANNA THAI.  I used to Live in Thailand and sometimes feel like a Thai food snob.  This is authentic--they actually speak Thai there.  They are truly Thai style restauranteurs and people.  The beef salad is delicious if you want something healthy.  Best Thom Kar ever!!  My BFs mom from Texas still talks about it.  The staples are great Panang, veggies, Thom Yum, everything really.  The decor inside is warm but modern.  Often we just get it delivered.  I would def recommend."}
{"text":"BEST Thai place. I frequent here or order to go quite often. Everything is always delicious and great service! The bbq spare ribs are the best I've had! I also love their delightful noodle, yellow curry, Tom Kai, and the golden cup appetizer! Also, they do free refills on Thai tea (that's a winner for me & keeps me always coming back!) and delicious sweet rice all year round! Always love the friendliness here and how fast they are!"}
{"text":"I order postmates delivery from this place all the time. They give very generous portions, and the food always comes delicious. There's these shrimp dumplings that are really good. I could eat those all night. I also recommend getting the pad se ew with beef. It has a little bit of that char smokey flavor and the noodles are soft.   The prices seem pretty reasonable as well. Delivery is always more expensive and it was still under $80 to feed 6 adults."}
{"text":"I usually order and take the food home but today I decided to eat in the restaurant. The food has always been delicious but what made me write this review was the service I received. Everyone, from my waitress to the host was kind and attentive and made everything even more enjoyable. This is my favorite Thai food restaurant."}
{"text":"Very very good Pad Thai. Was very juicy and tasteful. Packed a lot of flavor.  The Tom Yum Kha was also very tasteful. It's essentially a hybrid of Tum yum soup and yellow curry."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I never tried Panna Thai until now but I'm glad I did. It was a rainy week this week in Vegas and after cooking something at home and it not turning out just right I called Panna.   I ordered the crab wontons and pork pad see ew. I have been on a pork kick lately so that was the reason instead of going traditional with the beef. I was really eager to try the crab wontons as I saw that it was made with real crab. Sure enough it was as delish as other Yelpers had said it was and I even told my husband he HAD to try it. The consensus in our household was that it was pretty great. The pork pad see ew was good but I'm a carbs person. The pork to noodle ratio was about 2:1 so I felt like I was eating a lot of meat. Overall the flavor was good I just didn't like the overbearing meat but if you are a meat eater than this is definitely for you. I have to say I felt like I did get my money's worth in regards to both items.   The next day I wanted to try the BBQ pork noodles. It's BBQ pork noodle soup and I really really really enjoyed the pork. It was tender and there was plenty (which in this case I appreciated). Yes, I know I'm picky but I felt that the pork to egg noodle ratio was just perfect. I also ordered the spicy basil pork. Now that dish was just ok...definitely not my favorite place to order it from as I missed the cucumbers that do come with it at other Thai places. Overall, I def enjoyed this place. They do get busy though because the second night even though we ordered it at 7:30 pm it still was a 20-30 minute pick up time. They deliver too if you really need some Thai food."}
{"text":"came in here for dinner tonight on a recommendation from a friend that was craving larb.  it was clean, service was friendly.  ordered the larb (obviously), i had the basil flat noodles, and my friend had the duck soup.  the food was surprisingly very good and satisfying.  the larb was flavorful and even though we got the spiciness of medium it definitely had a kick.  i had the basil noodle with squid with medium spicy and it definitely had some kick to it.  a great thing about this place is free refills with their thai iced tea.  overall it's a good place.  only downside is this place is a bit pricier than thai places nearby (aka thai noodle house) but the ambiance is more \"date night\" type rather than quick bite to eat stops.  you can't go wrong with trying this place.  you're gonna get a good meal especially if you live on this side of town and lotus of siam is a bit of a drive."}
{"text":"Did I seriously not write a review on this place yet?   I've frequented MANY thai places (all in LA except for Lotus of Siam), and this place is pretty dang good.   LArb- 5 star. THe best I've had. Maybe they had a good day, I dunno, but it had a great amount of lime and cilantro with a serious kick. DELICIOSO!  Drunken Noodle- 5 star. AKA Pad Kee Mao.  SOOOO GOOOOOOD. LOVE.   Panang curry- 2.5 star.  Meh, I'd skip this. It was heavy on the cream and tasted a bit too americanized for my taste.   In general the food here is a bit more americanized than authentic thai. I like the decor, and the prices are awesome.   My fave here so far is the THAI ICED TEA.   I can really taste the black tea in there instead of the one's that are just diluted with a bunch of cream in it. And free refills? Too good to be true. That's unheard of in L.A.    Def Try."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I've ever had I ordered scallop asparagus and shiitake I couldn't have more than 2 bites... It was tasteless and after I had the first bite there was a paste of oil on the top of the inside of my mouth it was so gross!! Also the scallops were like rubber so chewy!!.. I also ordered basil noodle with beef it had no flavor the only thing that was decent was the BBQ chicken from the grilled section... And I asked to get some peanut sauce for it which I didn't get.... I'm never coming back!!"}
{"text":"The whole point of ordering online is for it to be convenient . What is the point of putting in special directions IF YOU DON'T READ THEM??? On top of the food taking over the 20 minutes they said it was going to take they threw onions all over my husbands food. He is allergic to onions can't eat them. I specifically wrote that in the special instructions . It's just upsetting because I really like the food but my husband is beyond livid .. so no more Panna Thai.  READ YOUR ONLINE ORDERS !!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious to eat the Spicy Ground Chicken Basil lunch special! For dessert, I got the mango sticky rice! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and I absolutely LOVE the lunch special! The best part about it is that it's one of the rare places you can find a lunch special on a Sunday afternoon. My fiancé and I often come here after church.   It's super reasonably priced for the beef sate and bbq chicken meals (what we normally get). It's only $7.95!   Their lunch special menu is front and back, so there's many options. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant! Best Thai food ever ! Highly recommended . The fried rice is really good ."}
{"text":"Really good food, friendly staff. Pad Thai was good med. wasnt spicy enough for me always afraid to ask for hot then its to hot at some places. I like the number system 1-10 better.... the glass noodle dish was nice too. Wings of an angel dish is a great ome for kids that like nuggets and such. Sate was pretty good seasoned well the peanut sauce was a little greasy. All in all great experience, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Got vegetable spring rolls, fried tofu, pineapple fried rice. It was nothing to write home about.   Ambience was nice enough and clean. The bathroom was a little dirty and you could tell it needed to be cleaned.   Where they really lost the stars was service. There was only three other parties in the joint and yet it felt like our servers were nowhere to be seen. I had some trouble understanding the waiter through his thick accent. They were very nice and friendly but I had to wait a while to have t water refilled and never got a refill on my ice tea.  I'm sure there are better Thai restaurants out here in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for the past 4 years and they do not disappoint me. This is my go to thai restaurant. Great ambiance and great service. Good pricing as well.... i love their refillable thai tea, beef panang, glass noodles, tom yum soup, beef spare ribs, yellow chicken (?) and fried tofu! Everytime i have visitors in town, i always bring them here because this restaurant delivers good food and service."}
{"text":"I heard that this is the sister restaurant of my favorite Thai BBQ on Jones so I've bookmarked this place and looked forward to going here ever since. It took me a year until I finally paid this place a visit. All thanks to Restaurant.com certificate, I went here with my sweetheart for dinner. We had to order a lot though just to uphold the certificate. My bf got the Pineapple Curry with beef and I got their Masaman curry with chicken. For our appetizer, we opted for their chicken/beef sa-te (satay?) and for the first time ever, we also got dessert: fried banana (coated with coconut flakes and deep fried). All of them tasted good, really good. The service was attentive and friendly. The decor was nice and intimate. The only thing that bothered me was their very see-through glass wall. Whenever a car would pass by or park right in front, their lights would blind the ones inside. They need to tint it a little. At the end of our meal, we could barely breathe since we ate more than usual. I was impressed by their fried banana since I'm very picky with both banana and coconut, so I was surprised at how I did not hate it at all. I just bought another Restaurant.com gift certificate. It must mean I really like this place =)"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of time and really like to try more. The atmosphere was nice, clean, good decorated 5/5. Service was great! 5/5. Menu is amazing having pictures so help me to picture the food would like like 5/5. There is interesting appertizers. I had shrimp cake and it was good! 4/5. Groud pork Basil was great 4/5 Tom ka kai has 2 sides small and big which the small one is big enough for 2-3, taste was great, not disappointed 5/5. BBQ pork ribs fried rice is my favorite for lunch, very big, delicious and reasonable price!  5/5. Some are a little pricey if comparing with other restaurants 3/5.  But I would come back and try again!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant on the SW side of town! Cozy atmosphere for groups of 2-6 people / extensive menu / cheap prices (most dishes start at $8.95) / and great service.  TIPS: If you usually order pad thai, opt for the Spicy Crab Noodle instead (stir-fried rice noodle with crab, egg, and green onion). If you usually order yellow curry, opt for the Panang Curry instead. I've tried the yellow curry before and it's too thin for my liking. The Panang Curry is just like yellow, but thicker and more flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to review based on service...   Basil Noodles: super fresh vegetables in the mix and they allow you to pick the kind of noodle (thick or thin) you want   Pad See Ew: perfect balance of sauce, broccoli and chicken. They allow you to pick between regular and Chinese broccoli   They have the option to make anything spicy which I loved.   Service: friendly and attentive- confused me order with someone else's twice... But food was so good it doesn't affect the rating."}
{"text":"I am not very adventerous with my Thai choices, and like mine Americanized, so no complaints there.  Beef Sa-Tay = So good.  Sweet, tender, with crispy grill marks.  The crispy burned pieces on meat makes me so happy.   Pepper Beef = Tender and a mild spice. My boyfriend likes this dish, but I am not fan of red/green peppers, so I just sneak a bite or two of just the meat. Pad Thai = Sweeter than other places, but always tasty. Pineapple Fried Rice = Comes with both Shrimp and Chicken which I like. I often ask for it to have a bit extra spice, but I think I like it better original.  There was a two large parties in there tonight, so the staff was busy with them - but we didn't feel abandoned.  I do have to say the ribs the table next to me ordered, looked delicious and might be the next thing I order!"}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this menu!  MUST MUST TRY THE DUCK ROLL!!! Even if u don't like sushi - don't be fooled by its deceiving look of it- it's NOT sushi but Man is it AmaZeballs! Everything I've ordered both times has been fantastic & gets here quickly - friendly delivery drivers This place is s real stand out amongst the many Thai places available in vegas - LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a visit to Vegas. We were all craving thai food and went off reviews closest to our friends house.   This place had pretty good food. Pad thai was really good and the rice as well. Papaya salad was fresh and refreshing.   I just wish the green curry and pad see ew were a little bit more sweet. But otherwise, good (takeout) thai food. Would definitely go back. Service was very good too."}
{"text":"It's bomb as Fuck can't even lie I have only ordered and delivered it to my house but spring rolls are bomb too"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Everything was delicious. The food was very light and had the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing, the service is friendly and the food is delicious. It's hard to stray from the curry or pad Thai since they're my favorites, but any time I've tried something new it was great."}
{"text":"We went for dinner a few weeks ago using a City Coups coupon for 1/2 off entree with purchase of an entree.    We ordered the  Pumpkin Shrimp Curry and the Mushroom and Broccoli with Pork. The shrimp had the tails on in the curry.  The broccoli was crisp and cooked perfectly.  The brown sauce was flavorful.  I would order both entrees again.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe that it's been over 7 years since we've been to this restaurant! It's not close to home, and I forgot about it until it was spotlighted in the LVRJ recently.  An hour before closing, we were the only ones there. (Two women showed up a bit later.) They were already doing some cleaning up, which may account for the very bright lights that weren't in evidence on previous visits.  Surprisingly, there were two Rieslings available by the glass. Our adorable server, Fon, couldn't tell me how the domestic or German offerings differed in terms of dryness, so she offered to bring a sample. She returned with a tray of four tiny sake cups, for both of us to taste the two wines. My husband was a little embarrassed, because he wasn't planning on drinking anything, but the wines were already poured. Very elegant presentation!  We ordered the grilled veggies as an appetizer. The zucchini and eggplant were wrapped with a wide slice of red pepper and topped with a drizzle of lime-infused oil. Delicious.  For our main courses, we chose Massaman Lamb Curry and Mango Tango Salmon. I made sure to say that I wanted the salmon cooked medium. Though her English was very limited, Fon repeated our order verbatim. While the curry was very good (though not the best ever), with lean lamb, as we requested, the salmon dish was a huge disappointment. It looked beautiful, with lots of basil, cashews, some mango, and a few flecks of red pepper. But not only was the salmon a tiny portion, it was thin, with one end not more than a millimeter in thickness. You can't possibly cook it medium when it's that thin. It was so dry and overcooked that we had no choice but to send it back. In its place, we ordered the Thai Pepper Steak.   While we waited for our replacement, Fon brought us a couple of complimentary cream cheese wontons. It's something that I would never order, since I try to avoid fried foods, but they were fabulous, and it was a really classy thing to do.  The beef dish was very good, with nicely tenderized beef, though not as exotic or spicy as I would have liked. While it was well-executed, it's probably my fault for not choosing something more adventurous.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Panna Thai - with kudos to our server for making things right!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice ambiance and you did not feel like you were too close to other diners. My party of 4 was quickly seated and our server promptly brought our drinks. I had a vanilla chai tea and it was amazing! I am a huge tea fan and I really could have knocked back 2 before my meal arrived. For my appetizer, I ordered the summer rolls and they were delicious. I absolutely love the taste of mint with the tangy peanut sauce. My main course consisted of the yellow curry with potatoes, coconut milk, and tofu. The curry had great flavor and even though I ordered it spicy, the peppers were not overbearing. If you are not really into spice, you can order no spice.   The only slight negative was our server appeared to be working a large amount of tables by herself, so she was rushing and some of the plates had a rough \"landing\" on our table. It was no big deal and other than that, it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"I normally get crab fried rice or spicy crab noodles, always awesome, food and service here is great, if your looking for Thai food definitely come to this place, like I said food is awesome. They're restaurant is very clean also, all the people that I have had or talked to here have been nice also."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp because I was craving some spice.  I had ordered my food ahead of time for quick pick up.    I decided to order the garlic short ribs since this dish had been one of the recommended as I read through the reviews.  When I arrived they greeted me with big smiles and since my order was not quite ready, they pointed me to have a seat in the mean time.  The atmosphere is like your typical Thai restaurant, big furniture and large art.    When I got my order I quickly took it back to my office to enjoy.  I decided to order more salad then having rice.  I think I jipped myself because there was not that much salad.  However, there was plenty of garlic short ribs.  I give it an A-OK rating because there were some pieces that were rather dry.  I thought it was going to be full pieces of short rib, but it was cubes.  So I didn't quite have what I thought I would of gotten.  The taste is good, but warning that you will be burping that garlic all day long.  LOL.    I probably will return to try out some other dishes.  Seems to be a hit or miss and I'll be determined to find that special dish.  Every place has a special dish."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing solely on their delivery service (and food). I've ordered from here through Eat24 a couple of times and both times they have been on schedule. My recent order included Panang Curry, Steamed Dumplings, and Tasty Ginger (with shrimp).  The curry was delicious. I ordered a mild but it came with a kick. Not sure if they got it wrong, or my tolerance is very low. It was creamy and very coconutty. The chicken was also nice and tender. I didn't really care for the dumplings. They were good, but they had an off taste that I couldn't quite figure out. The dipping sauce that came with the dumplings was a bit too strong in flavor. The tasty ginger with shrimp was my favorite. It had just the right amount of ginger and spices and the shrimp (peeled) was perfectly cooked. Their Thai tea is also very good (pretty generous with the cream, which I like).  If you're ordering through Yelp Eat24, the entrees come with rice. The menu doesn't state that. I wish I knew beforehand because I ordered 2 servings of rice and it came with 4."}
{"text":"Delivery took over 45 minutes but the online ordering was pretty easy and painless.  Beef Salad was the best item in my order.  As another reviewer mentioned, the beef was nicely smokey, and it was okay quality meat, not gristly.  The salad is mostly meat, with light lettuce and some tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is mostly lime juice, which I like.  A good low calorie fairly-healthy choice.  I would have liked cucumber slices that were a bit larger.  Chicken Fried Rice was kind of weird, there were clumps that were really sweet (maybe it was sweetened eggs?), but mostly it was really bizarrely bland.  Tons of onions.  Not much chicken or tomatoes.  I would not get this again, myself.  Green Milk Boba was overpriced, the cup was small styrofoam (12-16oz if there wasn't any ice), 50% ice at least, and barely any boba ($1 upcharge).  The boba were super overcooked to the point they had melted down small.  For $4.50 I could have a monster-size boba somewhere else.  This place is not cheap, but still one of the better delivery options in this neighborhood.  Maybe I'll enjoy some of their other dishes more."}
{"text":"We got two lunch pad thai's for pick up and all the food stayed warm which was awesome! The salad was the only downfall. It was just a handful of lettuce with some sesame seeds and carrots. Other than that though, the pad Thai was great and a good amount for the price!"}
{"text":"Our family of 5 went for a special occasion on a Tuesday night after deciding we were in the mood for thai food and reading several reviews off yelp.   I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in other reviews as I was that night.   Entering, this place was empty...like uncomfortable empty. There was another couple with a child, and even though the atmosphere was great (the ambiance earned them the two stars!) it was just too empty for 9pm at night.   We order several dishes including papaya salad, pad see eu, pineapple curry, masaman curry, and pineapple rice (which was actually never brought out to us, but after tasting some of the other stuff, we were pretty ecstatic that we wouldn't have to waste more of our money). We also ordered thai tea (one with boba) - which was decent and we weren't charged for refills (which is a plus compared to other places). However, the boba was rock hard -- this might be because it was late at night and they just wanted to get rid of leftovers, but that's not OK at all.   Out of all the dishes, I ONLY enjoyed the papaya salad and the pad see eu. I felt as if the pineapple curry and the masaman curry were the EXACT same - the only difference was that the pineapple curry had pineapple. The curry was also too watered down.   All in all, the atmosphere is what's given them my two stars. Service was also on par, no one was rude.   However, I noticed that a tip was added on to my initial check. So beware of that.   I'll be trying out plenty of other thai places before I give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Food is delicious here. Been coming for years, only downside is you can tell that sometimes the proteins or coconuts have gotten a little old. Not bad, but not really fresh either. We were here New Year's Eve and we waited almost a full hour for one of our dishes, they must've forgot with all the takeout going out the door. Always really nice people though."}
{"text":"BS ++  The place is cute and a little modernized.  However it's chilly inside.  And I am not talking about  the spice in the food either.  So if you visit bring your sweater.  The waitress was hard to understand but we got our orders in.  We requested to put no salt in the food because my father-in-law was sensitive to it.  The  choices are typical but the presentation for the food was fancy.  The food came out one at a time (15 minutes wait) but it was still salty!! I  did like the appetizer.  We ordered all seafood dishes except for the bbq chicken.  We also ordered coconut  ice cream for dessert.  The waitress said  it was for one person but it's huge! Also,  if you are planning to come here after the gym make sure it's not ARM DAY!  They must have the heaviest teapots.  It weighed as much as a baby elephant!     Overall it was a good experience with lots of laughs.  I recommend bringing a date here.  It was nice and clean.  Food is GOOD and HUGE PORTIONS (spicy) Selection was ON POINT and NOT TOO OVERWHELMING Restrooms are CLEAN and got COOL RUSTIC LIGHTS Tables FANCY and RUSTIC Table wait time PLACE WAS EMPTY Room temperature was on the chilly side Customer service is GREAT (If I can understand most of it) Ambiance FANCY Kitchen SUPER CLEAN Parking lot was big but shared with  a lot of restaurants.  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"My to go spot for thai food! When im craving some good thai food, this is the place to go. The flavors are always consistent unlike other thai places.   My recent order pad see ew, asparagus with beef, and bbq ribs.  The Pad see ew uses large egg noodles. Very soft. More sou sauce based unlike the pad thai. But very delicious. They offer choices between regular broccoli or the chinese broccoli for the dish.   Asparagus and beef stir fry. It was seasoned perfectly. Not too salty, asparagus had a crisp to each bite and not overly cooked.   Bbq ribs. Gives you 3 large ribs marinated with a soy sauce asian bbq sauce. It was great as well. It came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and fried rice with it as well. The meat was very tender, and came right off the bones. It's a musy try!   Overall, a great thai restaurant. You can never go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Order Crispy Tufo, Salmon Delight, & Basil Fried rice with shrimp To go. As usual everything is good. Highly recommend for quick Thai food fix."}
{"text":"Tom Kha soup was delicious!!!  Nice ambiance and decor; however, the music was a bit too loud. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food and service! My kids and husband loved their food and we will certainly go back since it KS some of the best thai food we have had!!! Our server (Apple) was great and cordial. Can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this restaurant is a bit more upscale than most Thai restaurants while menu prices are more than reasonable given the quality of the food.  On this evening over  1/2 the restaurant was set up for a large party, but our karma was good as we were able to order before most of the guests arrived. We began with yum-wood-sen, glass noodles with ground meat and shrimp with Thai spice and lime juice on lettuce.  For entrees we shared orders of scallop tamarind and spicy eggplant.  All three dishes made our taste buds jump for joy.  Our bill came in a few cents short of the minimum purchase requirement so I had to order a soda for takeout."}
{"text":"This place always forget one item but they return in less than 15 min and with an extra something. So I love them and they still get 5 stars. We always get the sticky rice and beef jerky! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I didn't even want to give ONE star.. But it's the only way I can write a review and warn you guys about this place..   They won't greet you until after 10 minutes of staring at you like you have a head growing out of your shoulder. We sat down, waited for anybody to even come by and ask if we needed any drinks. So I tried to look by the servers and get their attention and they did look at me, but kept doing whatever they were doing which was nothing at all. It wasn't even that busy, maybe 5 tables and 3 servers. It's sad because I actually really like their food also my guy and I live right down the street so it was convenient for us, but man the service just straight sucks here. I'm a server as well so I know how these things work. I couldn't imagine doing this to anybody.   The food is great we always love coming here, or did anyway. However this happens almost every single time.. We just kept giving them the benefit of the doubt and chance after chance.. Even the people next to us, just 2 people, warned us how they've been waiting almost an hour for their food.. That's absurd.   We left and went to Archis Thai Bistro on Rainbow & 215. Always great service and we were in and out of there in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"sooooo good! The crab wontons are delicious and I usually get the spicy crab noodles. The portions are HUGE and everything is cooked fresh and hot. I only give it 4 stars because the staff isn't always very nice. Definitely a great take out place :)"}
{"text":"Lots of excellent Thai food restaurants in Vegas, thankfully. The food here is good but the service really bad compared to other Thai restaurants in the area. They charge a lot for delivery and for extra additions to their rather bare dishes. They were extremely rude to my wife on the phone with our last order and hung up on her after getting our order wrong.   A few times I've gone in to pick up orders with a massive queue of other disgruntled take out customers waiting for their food for over 45 minutes. And they expect you to say sorry for being upset with them! I rarely ever leave negative reviews but this is a classic example of the mixed bag of service you get in the city which should take customer service more seriously since it's the only industry keeping the city afloat."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I love pineapple fried rice and this place was great.  The garlic stir fry was flavorful and spicy just how I like it. The food was hot and came earlier then the estimate delivery time. I will definitely order from here again maybe dine in next time."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas I eat here at least once a week! The crab Ragu own is amazing and the papaya salad is probably my favorite thing on the menu! I love that they have whole coconuts and of course that they deliver!"}
{"text":"Whether you eat in or order take out, you can't go wrong here. Plentiful portions and well seasoned.  As a vegan, there are plenty of options for me. I've been here a couple of times and they are always consistent with food quality. You won't be disappointed. Heck, they even deliver! What could be better than that?"}
{"text":"This place has really great yellow curry. Tom yum was not the greatest I've ever had. The vegetable spring rolls were amazing and fresh. Thai tea was good too. The ambiance in this place was great. It is a great Thai restaurant not in the strip area."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, the food here is really good. The service is terrible. The first time I ordered I had it delivered. The delivery time I was given was 30 minutes. The food showed up an hour later and the driver forgot the Thai ice tea. The driver told me they would adjust the bill and credit my card back. That never happened. Because the food is so good I decided to give them another chance, bad idea. This time I decided to pick up the food so 1 I wouldn't have to wait as long and 2 they couldn't forget anything this time. Wrong again! Ordered online and paid for it. The time given was 10-35 minutes. 20 minutes after I ordered I got a call telling me it would be an hour at best. Really an hour?!?! So I said sure it was already paid for and I figured if I cancelled it now I wouldn't get my money back. 10 minutes after the first call I get another call confirming my order. Then a third call asking how I wanted my tofu cooked when I had already told them how I wanted it cooked when I ordered and then again in the first call. I feel like I've given this place a chance and they have failed. If they could get the service together this would be a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We had a company Christmas party at the restaurant with more than 30 people. The food came out on time with no delayed, presentation is really nice and taste good on all dishes. The service is also excellent, very friendly and attentive. I would recommend to reserved your table 2-3 weeks in advance for the party as they can get really busy. The item that I would recommend is Sa-tay, pad thai, pepper steak, spicy green curry, and the BBQ. I will go to Panna Thai every time I think of Thai food."}
{"text":"Finally tried somewhere different than the usual few restaurants I usually go to in Summerlin. Driving way out to the southwest to try a new restaurant was a big adventure for me :)  Boy, was it worth it.  I go to Archi's very frequently, and I still love that place, but the Tom-Yum soup at Panna Thai was mind blowing.  This is the first time I've ever used that expression, BTW--\"mind blowing.\"  Also loved the vegetable egg rolls and pad thai w/ tofu.  Service was top-notch.  Interior of restaurant was lovely.  I already can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I ordered a red curry chicken, and chicken chow mein. Unfortunately curry was the worst I ever had. Bamboo shoots were under cooked, therefore each time I put one in my mouth after chewing a few times I had to take it out. And the chicken was extremely overcooked. with chow mein, it was only so so, bit bland. I have eaten here couple of times before, never had a problem. I am assuming a new  cook maybe? Extra star is for the service, guys who work here are always very polite and quick."}
{"text":"Two stars for decent Thai food. But tonight will be the last time I order from Panna Thai.  Let me recap. On 12/28/15 I placed an order and it took 2 hours and 13 minutes to arrive. Because of this inconvenience, I was told I would receive a free order of pad Thai.  Tonight I said to my wife, \"Oh hey I have a free order of pad Thai babe!\" so I placed another order with them. The woman who took my order was able to see the note on my account immediately which was great. She took my order, and gave me my total and reiterated I was receiving the pad Thai for free. -Not once did she read my order back to me-. (You will see why this detail is important later)  The delivery was prompt this time, about 40 minutes as opposed to the atrocious amount of time it took on Monday. I ordered the following:  -Thai iced coffee -Chicken pad Thai (the freebie) -Beef Sa-te (my wife's fave) -Chicken basil rice   I received all of the above as well as 3 free egg rolls, which was nice. However, they gave me chicken sa-te instead of beef. Mind you this is my wife's favorite, and if I order sa-te it's going to be beef.  So I call just to let the restaurant know, thinking maybe this is something that was miscommunicated due to an error in their order placement system. I wasn't asking for a handout or anything. But instead the woman on the phone tells me that she was the one who took my order, and I definitely ordered chicken sa-te because she read my order back to me. \"This is part of the rules.\" she says, so I must be crazy. My wife doesn't love the beef sa-te, and I must have ordered chicken. I responded to her telling her that it's not a big deal, I just wanted to let them know, yet she tells me I'm wrong and hangs up.  Needless to say, my family and I will be ordering from a different place when we get the craving for Thai in the future.  Thank you for the free egg rolls though, that would have been a very nice touch if things turned out differently."}
{"text":"I have been to Panna Thai a handful of times over the years. It's never busy, but it's never empty every time I have been.  It's simple to call & order pick-up, which would be ready in 15 min. However, I suggest to never order Thai Tea if it's pick-up. It's great when you dine-in & you can get unlimited refills, but as for pick-up, it's never as good. I'm going to assume that they make the Thai Tea when you call, which in time, will sit & be watered down by the time you pick-up. I also suggest to pass on adding boba. I never find it fresh.  Other than that, their food is good & their portion sizes are good. I have always liked all the food I tried. My go-to is the Spicy Crab Noodle, which is made with legit crab & large enough to share with another person. Panna Thai is a good option to eat at with a family & share different items on the menu. You can end your meal with a Mango Sticky Rice for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great food great service!  Love the beef panang! So yummy!  Thai ice tea is very tasty too!  Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I order from this location occasionally. The food is OK, and the portion is usually generous. However, I give the restaurant only two stars based on my last two experiences with them. One time I ordered some lunch specials to go including a beef Pad Thai. When I started to eat I immediately noticed the beef was spoiled and tasted disgusting. It's not just not fresh it's literally spoiled. So I threw the entire box away. The second time I placed the order online for pickup at about 7:45 pm. When I arrived the restaurant at 8:10 they appeared to forget about my order. I waited in the lobby and expected my order to be ready in 10 mins as the restaurant was only 1/3 full. However, I waited until almost 9 PM! They gave me a free Thai tea for my wait and I guess that's why I hesitate to give them a 1 star."}
{"text":"I tried this place out 3 times, but only because I was working across the street.    1 Star Because the food is EXCELLENT - I tried there BBQ Rib lunch special and it was amazing.  There Egg Noodle Soup is also very very good.  The duck noodle soup is good also.  The food is not super high quality but they make it work.  1 Star Because the service is very good and nice.  They know every person that comes in by first name and provide a friendly atmosphere  1 Star Because the Thai Tea is very good.  Any that restaurant for me should have excellent Thai Tea.  The portion is a bit small but standard.  1 Star Because the parking is easy and the spot is big enough to fit everyone and you are seated immediately.  -1 Star due to the food taking a very long time.  A lunch is 1 hour standard for most people.  I work across the street and cannot get my food in time.  It takes at least 40 min for the food to come out and i made it back late to work.  every time.  I even left early to go eat at panna thai and i was still late.  One time, every single person in the restaurant did not have food.  Total: 3 Stars = Eat on weekends and nighttime if you are local.  Not a place to drive far to eat or if you are rushed on time."}
{"text":"This place has new owners and the food is now terrible. I don't know why people keep eating here there are so many good Thai restaurants around here... I guess people are just stupid, or they're all smokers who have killed their taste buds and can't tell the difference.  I used to go here all the time but now I will avoid it like the plague!"}
{"text":"We had dinner for my cousins birthday last Friday and we had a great time! So many options for a meat free meal for Good Friday. Free refills on Thai iced tea was a added bonus. Great service from the ladies and even brought us a free dessert when they found out it was her birthday! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night for dinner and it was an excellent experience.  The service was outstanding, the waitress made sure the refills flowed and everything was taken care of.  The duck roll and scallop appetizers were great, the golden cups were just average.  The seafood soup was a bit bland, but I added hot peppers from the condiment tray.  Basil tuna was outstanding.  Great place for Thai food."}
{"text":"We visited Panna last night.  I was a little aprrehensive since the online coupons have brought us to pretty run down places.  The moment we walked into Panna, I was pleased.  The lighting was dining room  perfect, the colors and decor were chic and welcoming, no typical greasy smell associated with asian restaurants.  The food was very impressive too.  good quality and fresh seafood and veggies and flavorful ingredience...and very appetizing but not too over the top presentation. We ordered the saute shrimp and egglant dish that came on a sizzling plate.  all veggies and seafoods cooked to perfection.  the basil & garlic dish with pork was excellent.  Kids got Chicken Satay, Angel wings, steamed dumpling, Pad Thai and  Pad na...all were good.  Maybe only the steamed dumplings lost a little steam.  Service was impeccable.  We are bringing our employees back to the restaurant again...tonight!"}
{"text":"The Yellow Curry that i ordered was AMAZING, very flavorful and just spicy enough to keep every bite interesting.  My only complaint is the amount of rice given... they only give 1 bowl of rice per order, and that is not nearly enough for an avid rice fan like me... (it also costs $1.50 for another small bowl)  Also tried the Fried Banana as  the dessert and the presentation was ELEGANT, the fried banana was coated in coconut and it tasted GOOD with the lemony type sauce it came with.  Great food and the price is definitely do-able.  Would go back there again simply for their Curry."}
{"text":"We were craving some Thai food but wanted to be \"adventurous\" and try something besides or usual neighborhood goto so I quickly browsed my bookmarked list and found Panna. I was hesitant at first because I heard their food was pretty Americanized but I'm glad we gave them a try. Called in and placed an order for pick up:  Chicken satay entrée: comes with 6 nicely sized skewers of seasoned chicken, fried rice, salad and peanut sauce. Really good and nicely priced at around $12 a great shareable dish!  Beef and asparagus: YUMMM the beef was so tender and the asparagus still had a nice crunch to it! Good brown sauce that was not too salty and MUSHROOMS!!! Mmmm  Chicken Pad Thai: Meh. This was not good.. The noodles were way too soft and overcooked... the dish overall was too sweet.   The 2 yummy dishes made us forget about the 1 meh dish.. Portion sizes and prices are good...We will definitely be back!  Hot Tip: Togo containers are the plastic reusable kinds... WoopWoop!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for my anniversary and decided to try this place. Overall, I had a great experience here. The food was awesome! I was on a mission to find the best Thai Beef Salad and I think I found it here! The service was phenomenal.   If you ever go to Las Vegas and want to dine away from Strip, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food was bomb! Got the pad thai with chicken and panang curry! Free thai coffee and thai tea refills!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials include a broad range for just about any taste preference.  Ground pork with basil & chili hit the spot with miso soup and a small salad.  The service team is polite, friendly and attentive.  As a newly arrived resident of the Las Vegas valley, Panna is the 'best' Thai restaurant I've tried so far.  With my office close by, my return is assured."}
{"text":"Another Thai restaurant experience - lunch specials are the way to go I tell you!  First off, Panna Thai Restaurant looks a bit more upscale than your average Thai joint, which I think reflects in the price as well.  We walked in to a relatively empty restaurant on a weekday.  As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).  We did not, but apparently they do have a lot floating around and are a bit restrictive about how they are used.  I think they are also on restaurant.com too.  Lunch specials are available everyday from 11 am to 4 pm.  They all include a fried wonton, fresh salad, steamed rice, and soup of the day.  (You can substitute fried rice or brown rice for $1 more.)    Started off with miso soup.  Interesting choice.   I went for the Yellow Curry Lunch Special with Tofu \"Thai yellow curry and Thai herbs served with Jasmine rice.\" ($6.95).   Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up!   The Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special \"Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice.\" ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.  Overall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.  There are definitely a few other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that has a foot up on selection, taste, and price."}
{"text":"Clean Place, kinda slow service but the food taste really good without doubt .. it HAS sweet scenery and beautiful paintings attach to the wall .. i always order through Eat24 and Lunch specials are really descent with the food size they serve .. i love this place"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Always great service and great food. I usually order the shrimp pad Thai, hubby gets Tom kha spicy and we get the kids a chicken sa te meal to share!! Also recommend the Thai tea boba drink, really refreshing and delicious!! Today we got strawberries for dessert as compliment. Happy Valentine's Day"}
{"text":"It's small, food is excellent! Polite courteous service.  Well... the Panang is still excellent, but the noodle dish was dry noodles with dry pork, tasteless and useless. They didn't add the chicken I paid extra for either."}
{"text":"Ordered pepper steak  from lunch special thai spicy. Disappointed .....no effort was made to cook it spicy at any level. I could have made the same meal w a Thai cookbook or DVD..Mediocre! Server offered to bring sauces to the rescue the meal but Thai is best cooked w spices. Service is their strength!"}
{"text":"The pad thai was disappointing and steamed dumpling was not even hot.  The only saving grace was the mango sticky rice.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for the past 3 years. I've dined both in restaurant and ordered from YELP's Eat 24! The restaurant is simply beautiful and elegant. The staff here are always friendly and welcoming. It is very clean in here which is a +++. Their Thai tea here is freaking bomb. Not too sweet, not too bitter and watered down. I also love that this place is literally down the street from my house.  I definitely recommend their satay (chicken/beef), fried rice, duck rolls, summer rolls, pad thai, tom kha gai soup, sticky rice &mango and their egg rolls! The staff here know me by name because they deliver to my house so much LOL. Sorry guys! ;)  The food here is freaking phenomenal. Who doesn't like amazing quality, reasonably priced thai food?! It is always made in a timely manner and great presentation. I've never gotten a bad dish here which is a surprise.   Thanks Panna thai for taking all of my money, but keeping my tummy happy! 5/5 and customer for liiiife!"}
{"text":"Ive only ordered delivery from this restaurant, never actually been inside... but twice now I've been very impressed!  Food is delicious!  And even the take out has good presentation. Portions are reasonable... not huge shareable size like many places. Some people may not like that. But I thought it was perfect. Warning... I ordered Spicy on my pad thai and it was REALLY spicy!  Lol. But I like things hot. The tuna taretare was really light with a unique tangy flavor that I loved. And the roasted vegetables were delicious, also served with a yummy tangy dressing. Will be ordering from here a lot!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because it was near our house and our favorite spot is across town. The service was great and the restaurant looked very clean.   The non-spicy pad Thai was a little spicy for my girlfriends taste but still tasted good.   The fried rice however had me sick all day the following day.   Looks like we will be sticking to our favorite spot across town."}
{"text":"I just stopped by for a quick lunch - OMG, what a treat! It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon so it's quiet with some excellent smooth soul-jazz; the people are sweet and kind, and the food is off the charts fabulous! I just had the lunch special but the two businessmen down the way from me had five large platters of amazing-looking stuff - there was no way they ate half of it, not because it wasn't good au contraire, but because it was just too much. I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Valentine made the experience really good I had a wonderful time and the food was phenomenal I would definitely come back with my family and friends"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite neighborhood places for Thai food in Las Vegas. They have an amazing variety of spices in all of their dishes that really put them ahead of other options, and I am obsessed with their noodle based offerings including their massive ramen bowls, pad Thai and chow mien. (I know not on the adventurous side of Thai cuisine, but equally delicious!)   In addition to take away, the restaurant interior is modern and relaxed and makes for a great lunch or dinner spot. It's never super busy, which is great for a quick or long meal. The staff is friendly and have provided awesome service every time I drop in.  They also provide complimentary refills for their Thai iced tea AND Thai iced coffee. Have you ever had Thai iced tea or Thai iced coffee? They are the BOMB and rarely ever offered unlimited at restaurants. They also serve beer and wine, including Singha the greatest Thai beer to ever exist.   If you're in the area you absolutely must try this place."}
{"text":"Great food! Good service! Comfortable environment! Decided to go here via Yelp reviews. Bell was my waitress, she was very kind and pleasant. I'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Since our dine in experience - we've order both to-go and delivery and have still yet to be disappointed - always on point!!  All of the curries and the crab fried rice are still our favorites!"}
{"text":"Service and speed are the reason why I give this a 2 star. Always a wait with plenty of tables available. Got a to go order. Salmon curry had approximately 8 cubes of salmon about 1/8 inch. Very small box and curry spilled all into salad that was about 5 pieces and egg roll was soggy   Much to be desired for take out."}
{"text":"We've never had any problems dining in and the food is great... however, whatever you do, do not order take out! Waited 20mins just to be told they never got my order/my order was lost. And then got a call about 10-15mins later saying I can go pick up my order."}
{"text":"Good food, good ambience, and fabulous service for a good price. We got panang curry (delicious), Thai steak (okay, a little salty), and sticky rice with mangoes (super cute and tasty). The serving size is big, so I think we would have been fine with just the curry. Looking forward to bringing guests here. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person. But this irritates me. I ordered a lunch special that comes with salad and an egg roll.  Well they stuffed the salad, egg roll and rice all in one side. I appreciate that they don't use Styrofoam containers.  But the egg roll and salad were super soggy. The food is tasty, but the soggy salad and egg roll sucked! I would appreciate my egg roll and salad being separated next time."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food!  I like the atmosphere here...it's very clean and friendly.  The food prices were also good, especially during lunch time!  Most plates were around $7.  On to the food!  Basil Noodle ($8.50): \"Pad Kee Mao\", Pork, Stir Fried Thick Rice Noodles, Chili Basil, Scrambled Egg, Bell Pepper and Onion. This was not bad...not very hot though for a 10/10. I also found the pork to be a little thick and tougher than I am used to at other Thai restaurants.  THIS is one the dishes I compare all other Thai restaurants in town...and this one wasn't very noteworthy :(  Chili Basil ($6.95): \"Pad Ka Pao\" in Lunch Portion, Ground up Chicken, Sauteed with Sweet Basil, Onion, Bell Pepper, Fresh Chili, and Jasmine Rice. This was a great version of the staple! The most spicy out of all the dishes...it was still far from a 10/10 though!  It was good though, and better than most out there!  Panang Curry in Lunch Portion : Coconut Milk, Curry Paste, Thai Herbs, and Jasmine Rice. This was a great version as well, with just the right amount of spices, flavor and heat! I love Panang curry...and they have a great one here!  Again, better than most I've had out here!  Pad Thai in Lunch Portion : Chicken, Stir Fried Rice Noodles, Scrambled Egg, Shallot, Bean Sprouts, and Tamarind Sauce. This was Grandpa's order...it was good! A bit sweet, but good overall!  I'd say it would be on par with the others I've tried.  Thai Iced Tea ($3)...unlimited refills! It was a good rendition as well, but you can't beat free refills...yeeeee!  Great choice for Thai food if you are in the area!  Pics :"}
{"text":"Panna Thai has a lot of options from you to choose from but if you want cool food, horrible service and  INSECTS in your food this is the place to come too. I know mistakes are made and you can't always control what happens but this is my 4th time finding some type of insect in my food or my baby sisters food. Most of the time their slow, it's a 50/50 chance if the food will come out hot or cold, you never know what temperature your food will come out or what's in it."}
{"text":"This is one of the very few Thai restaurants that is very consistent with flavor and quality. Out of all the times we have been there whether it's taking out or dining in they have always surpassed our expectations. Here in Vegas we're pretty spoiled with our food choices because of the amount of restaurants within a 10 minute drive but this one in particular has made its rounds consistently in our top 10."}
{"text":"One of my fave Thai spots and super close too. Im always in for tom kha soup! Yummerz! Beef pad see ew is good, my husband's favorite. Crab rangoon and fried shrimp are not to be snobbed at. I love curry dish, i haven't tried the panang yet. Im not so impressed with massaman curry though. It lacks flavors maybe salt? Too souppy. I like my curry a little bit thick. And who can forget thai iced tea or coffee??? I love both. Plus its free refill!!! Free refill people! I usually get mango sweet rice. Too bad mango is not in season anymore."}
{"text":"my first visit using a restaurant.com coupon- the food was tasty and favor-ful, but I must agree the portions are a bit small.. The service was top snotch and attentive. I would go back, maybe try the lunch special, yummy..."}
{"text":"The Best Thai food I've  had in Las Vegas so far. Service was great, servers were very nice and attentive. Everything we ordered was outstanding. Good ambience  with soft jazz music and candlelight , felt like fine dining experience but way less Expensive. Will definitely back and recommend everyone to try. The comlimentary fried banana desert from our server Apple,  was Awsome!!! Thank you everyone."}
{"text":"This place is great. Portions are really the only thing keeping them from my 5 stars. But the food is delicious. They make it fairly quickly, and the service is about what you expect for an asian restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Ordered from here and was told it would be to my home within 45 mins...  An hour and a half later I got a call from the restaurant asking if they had the correct address, I informed them of the correct address and was told they would be to my home ASAP... 30 mins later I called the restaurant and was told a lie that they didn't know what to do with the food and was told another story by not only the manager but the original driver who contacted me.  I am so disappointed and will not order from them again nor will I recommend them at all.  They offered me a 5 dollar discount for my next order... Laughable since this order was almost 60.  Time to move on"}
{"text":"My husband took me to Panna Thai last night for my birthday.  The restaurant  is clean, the staff is kind and accomodating, and the decor is lovely.  We brought our three children, ages 6, 5, and 2, to dinner with us and the staff was so great with them. As far as the food goes, I thought that it was delicious!  I ordered the yellow curry chicken (medium spicy), my husband ordered the peppered steak dish, and our kids shared the sweet and sour chicken (not the fried Chinese dish, this was fresh and pan seared) and the chicken chow mein noodles.  Everything was tasted absolutely wonderful!  My kids really loved the soup that they brought out before our entrees arrived.  The broth had so much flavor. I would highly recommend Panna Thai.  I know that we will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"This is my third order for Panna Thai delivery, and every single time they have forgotten the cucumbers and pineapples for my simple Thai Salad. I don't understand - its clearly in the description. I don't just want lettuce, tomato and grilled chicken next time (If there is a next time at this point....)   :(  They are not knowledgable, but they are very friendly and the grilled chicken tastes good."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my parents' anniversary with a large group of family. We reserved 8 tables in a section of the restaurant and had a dedicated server. The food was served one by one like a numbered course meal, and each dish was fresh. All the food tasted good, and the mango sticky rice dessert was shaped like a heart!  The server was pretty attentive, and we got our refills at good intervals. Free refills on Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Indeed, you're correct!  Thai places are a dime a dozen, but Panna may just be what you're craving.  Do you have a hankering for spicy eggplant, wait dumplings did I hear you whisper?!  Something extra spicy aka hellaciously hot is what you wish for- go ahead and let them know when you order:)  Please opt for a fried rice, yes I do always opt for the pineapple fried rice.  Hell, if it's not broke don't fix it! Insert wink emoji here please! I add snow peas into one.  Please note the picture I posted this time around:) Meats are succulent and scallops are always cooked accordingly!   Panna provides one with traditional & distinctive Thai in all levels.  Panna is the spot on place for to devour bowls of curry! So hurry!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Ordered delivery. They arrived right on time! Ahi tuna salad was amazing. Crab fried rice was tasty!! Curry chicken fettuccine was genius!! Ive been to plenty of thai restaurants and i was impressed!!"}
{"text":"My family and I dined here on Sunday. We arrived around 1pm. Not many people in the restaurant. Just a fair amount. The server that sat us down was not friendly. Didn't greet us, didn't smile and didn't explain the menu. Mind you, this was our first visit. The food was okay. Took a long time to come out and lacked some flavor. Their Thai tea was a whopping $4! Free refills thank god but that's too much for Thai tea in my opinion. The place had a nice ambience and was clean. Would I come pack? I doubt it."}
{"text":"I have been to Panna thai restaurant multiple times. I have tried their duck noodle and pad thai. Very friendly staff and food is very tasty while affordable.   We are already a repeat costumer and it is strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Loved the eggplant and tofu skewers. I would get the sauce on the side next time. looking forward to trying it more"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere  Great food Very reasonable pricing  I promise you will be impressed by this Thai restaurant"}
{"text":"I've tried many Thai places in Las Vegas, this one is hands down the best."}
{"text":"Just flat out good. Had Pumpkin Curry, very close to my favorite dish at my regular spot in Seattle!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Thai restaurants in Vegas (yeah even Lotus of Siam... Which has great food but the ambiance of a bus depot)... This is hands down our favorite Thai restaurant.  Nice ambiance, great pricing, and the dishes are amazing. I usually stick to the Crab Wantons and Pad Thai but they have a new tapas menu that is insane. Everything we tried was a winner.   Hidden Thai jewel in the southwest. I promise you."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the staff is friendly and the food is great! Nice decor overall & the free refills on Thai iced tea when dining in are a plus. The Papaya Salad and Pad See-ew are delicious.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Value of lunch special was decent--for 6.95 you get your choice of meat, a soup and a small fried won ton.  We had garlic short rib and chicken satay special.  Satay was good, garlic sb ok sauce was a little too strong/salty.  We also ordered pork larb which was good...don't order fried egg rolls as these were frozen and not hand made...I wish I didn't order it.  Restaurant was hot...and there wasn't anyone else as far as patrons.  Service was good and restaurant was clean.  I'd go again but only if in the area...one good thing is lunch ends at 4 where as most places it is 3.  One bad they charge for more rice at 1.50 per bowl."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery and pick up and service is always polite and fast. Our go to is the ped see ew and curry dishes and they are always delicious! For pick up I was greeted by Apple who was really friendly:) The restaurant looks clean and nicely decorated. I want to try a dine in experience next time and I'm sure we won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Panna Thai is the sister company of Thai BBQ, which my family and I been coming to since I was a kid!  So knowing that, their menu is pretty similar and the ambiance is great. It's more of a modern twist with Thai vibes.   I celebrated my best friend's birthday here with her family and we ordered a whole bunch of items to share from bbq chicken to pad Thai, salad and fried rice and you can't forget The unlimited refills for Thai Iced Tea, AMAZING!  Definitely a neighborhood friendly spot and great menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"Decided to give them another go tonight. I've definitely experienced better, much better, and even from Panna Thai. The wife's pad kee mao didn't have the little corns, tomatoes and was just boring and not well thought out. My green curry with beef had a whopping 3 pieces of eggplant in it and they tried to make up for the lack of the beef's flavor with tons of heat when I asked for medium.  Enough is enough and we won't be going back. There are far too many other options in the area to continue going there for lackluster food."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but with the handful of times I've been there...worst customer service, EVER."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are priced right, however, the meat dishes tend to be overcooked, hard and dry. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a good tasting Thai restaurant literally just 2 minutes away from me!!! From my most recent visit here, I got the papaya salad and the beef pad see ew. From my pictures it looks like the portions are small but those two were enough to really fill me up (and I eat a lot). For the papaya salad, I got to choose a spicy level from 1-10 and I got a 6 and it was actually pretty spicy which I appreciate, but my favorite was my pad see ew. The beef was so tender and it was actually thick slices of beef which makes it so much more better. The noodles were not dry, they were perfectly soft. They also have a lunch deal as well so if you just want something small for a good price, ask about it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai food spots in town. I've dined in and ordered out and always had a great experience. The food is authentic & the servings are generous."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. Great service and great food. The lunch specials are pretty inexpensive and the service is fast. Great place for a lunch break. Always friendly and clean.  Awesome desserts too."}
{"text":"Love LOVE love this place. I've never been to the actual restaurant but have ordered through doordash and this place is fantastic.   We have ordered a few things off the menu, but my favorite is the chicken satay with peanut sauce (it also comes with egg fried rice and cucumber salad) and of course the chicken pad Thai. It has some kick, but not a ton. I def will keep ordering from this place and wanna try out their Thai tea or coffee next."}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 times now, trying different items, and every meal has been wonderful. Friendly staff, comfortable decor, great service... Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I got carry out of tum yum soup and panang chicken, the tumyum soup was good but the panang chicken was terrible!! The sauce was so runny it seemed like they added a ton of water to the sauce and it had absolutely no taste at all.. I love panang and have gotten it at many thai places and none have had the sauce so runny and watery"}
{"text":"I love the chicken curry here. The fried rice is really good too. The place is really nice inside."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Thai BBQ for years & we recently found out this was their sister restaurant so we decided to give it a try!  The server was very accommodating to my bf & I who were the only vegans in the table and helped make our entrees vegan friendly - we got the Spicy Basil Fried Rice (no eggs) with steamed tofu, Pad Thai with fried tofu, a small order of Tom Kha soup with steamed tofu (big enough for the both of us to share) and all were mild spice. I also ordered a Thai iced coffee and my sister ordered a Thai tea which both have non-dairy creamer in it. We loved how it's refillable - just like their Thai BBQ locations!   The food was pretty good and tasted exactly like their counterpart restaurant but none of our dishes had the spice level we asked for. We were really looking for that spicy kick to our food but had to ask for the hot sauce spice rack to add it in ourselves. Heads up that their \"mild\" is probably considered a 1 or 2, not like your usual mild at a Thai place which is usually at a level of 3 or 4.  My family enjoyed their dishes which included the shrimp Panang penne, pork jerky, BBQ chicken with fried rice, chicken pad Thai, crab fried rice and pork BBQ ribs. The only comment they had was the crab fried rice barely had any crab in it but overall they had a good experience.   Service was good and the restaurant definitely had a fancy ambiance."}
{"text":"Okay we tried this place out because we wanted Thai and went with the least delivery charge among the delivery apps. (We went with grub hub lol) And we've stuck with them ever since!  The fella orders the crispy duck which is heavenly! Very well seasoned, perfect crisp, delicious hoisin sauce and overall truly unforgettable.   I order the crying tiger and OH MY I cry tears of joy every time!! The meat is so tender and flavorful with a sauce that though is quite delightful is not truly needed. However, I do at times use the sauce for my veggies!  It's a great dinner for when you want something delivered that won't ever disappoint!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Wish I knew about this place sooner. Started with the egg rolls then ordered the pork BBQ noodle soup. So delicious and a huge portion That I had enough to take home and have for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"This thai place is very good but ordered it too much over a period time.   But recommend it if you live in the area or craving thai. They deliver and the inside of the restaurant is clean and welcoming.  Recommend their chicken panang curry, beef pad thai, shrimp tom yum soup and my absolute favorite their crab cream cheese rangoon's.  If you have a sweet tooth their mango & sticky rice is pretty good and the mango is already sliced in slices for easy eat."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I absolutely loved it!!! The food was super fresh and prices are reasonable! It's hard to find good Thai Restaurants and this one is on my favorites list!"}
{"text":"Their tom yum soup was absolutely fantastic. It had a lot of depth of flavor, and the medium heat packed a punch. The Beef Satay was also very good and rounded out a truly delicious dinner."}
{"text":"It's the 2nd time we ate here. First time we came was based off Yelp reviews and the fact that we just live down the road next to Wet n Wild. My husband and I are vegetarians but not strict enough to worry about fish sauce or similar stuff like that. We mostly just order the food with tofu instead of meat or seafood. This place does it well. Very much comparable to our favourite Thai place which is just a little further from home - Archi's on Rainbow.  The first time we came, I ordered the lunch special - both of us agreed that the soup that came with it was so tasty! I had the Pad Thai and he had the tofu Panang Curry. Both delicious!!  Today we tried the Summer Rolls with peanut sauce!! OMG YUM! Will definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"Fairly typical Thai dishes, well done with lots of veggie choices. One of the few thai restaurants that gives you refills of thai iced tea which should be the standard for a $4 drink. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Hard to quibble with that."}
{"text":"Really good flavor and very light food. We got the pineapple curry fried rice, chicken wings, and sweet & sour chicken. All were very good!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this library cation for 9 1/2 years now and I'm impressed how they keep the food consistently good. I've brought other family members and friends here they can't get enough. My most favorite item from the menu has to be the crab wontons ."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed this place the two times before we went awhile back but recently had a horrible expierence.  Not sure if they hired new folks but they were just rude.  My family and I a total of 6 of us with two little ones went in and the service was super poor.  There was only 2 other people in the restaurant.   When we went to order we just asked to have a chicken breast for my daughter and they said no whole meal...they were so focused on serviing whole plates they couldn't accomadate.  I even told them to charge us the full price but just a chicken breast is what I needed but they said no that they couldn't do it.  We asked for a side of broccoli and carrots and they said no.  It was ridiculous.  At that point I didn't care if they charged me $20 bucks for broccoli that is what we needed but they couldn't do it.  Finally my husband went to talk to the gentleman behind the counter and asked for the manager and he was very rude and said no manager here and there was nothing he could do.  My husband said we would leave so we all got up and went next door to the sushi place where they always treat us great.    The gentleman tried to make excuses saying it wasn't his fault and he didn't serve us and he was busy with the two other people in the restaurant.  They still charged us for food they never brought us and we were so frustrated that we gave them the money and left.  We will never go back ever and I would suggest if you want a stressfree meal not to go as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got their chicken sate. It was very good. Server and the rest of the staff were sweet."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here this evening and the food items we chose were very good. I had combination fried rice and he had pineapple fried rice and we shared crab won tons.   However, this is where the good experience ends. We waited 45 minutes for fried rice dishes accompanied by less than mediocre service. As we were waiting other guests arrived and walked out from waiting so long. It's a shame because the food quality is excellent and this restaurant could be one of the best."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have almost tried everything on their menu and have loved everything. My favorite is the Chicken Saute. Everyone who works there is great, food is great, and it's clean!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the quality has gone down. The noodles taste plasticy, dried up chicken, not fresh tasting and juicy at all like used to be. After ordering online through yelp24 well before opening for a 11:20 am pick up, had to wait for 20 minutes for the order which ended up being lukewarm and missing the eggroll for the lunch special."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly atmosphere.  Food was excellent !!  My friends and I were in town and had craving for Thai food, I found this place on Yelp, and we were not disappointed.  Pad Thai & Panang curry is the best I've ever had.  Food was served fresh, delicious and quickly.  Their Tom Kha soup is to die for.., so much flavors.  Service was great, friendly and attentive.  I will definitely go back and I would recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Panna since the day they opened. There food taste has been very consistent. They have great lunch specials at affordable prices. The restaurant as a whole is more modern, the decor and the plating. Also the way the dishes are cooked defiantly is unique to this restaurant, they use crushed dried spices and it's usually topped on ever dish I get. I love the shrimp pad Thai, panang curry, and papaya salad."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch 2 days, and was honestly thinking of giving it just 4 stars until the second day when I got the pink noodles.    This place has really good food, I really don't have anything to complain about, but it just wasn't blow my mind status...until I looked at the regular menu and saw the pink noodles.  SO GOOD!!!  It's a bit sweet but at the same time spicy and you can choose what types of noodles: thick flat, thin noodles, or egg noodles, and I got mine with the squid and shrimp, and they didn't skimp on that amount either which was spectacular. I was sooooo happy with my food!!  I also ordered the asparagus and mushrooms, smaller plate but definitely a good size, cooked well and the mushrooms tasted amazing!!  I will probably be back in the area again sometime for work and I am definitely planning on coming back here for some of that awesome food! :)"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and delicious lunch special! Free thai tea if you leave review here on yelp :) yumm!"}
{"text":"Just swung in to get some Pad Thai to go. Nice place and still seemed busy after the lunch rush.   My Pad Thai was mediocre. Not bad but I wouldn't order it again. I ordered it \"spicy\" which equated to \"a little bit of heat\" in my mind. Take that for what it's worth. Also, my wife says she only gets curries here and they are very good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend.. The food, service n establishment awesome!! The lunch specials were not only tasty but plated nicely and big portions. Oh and prices are so affordable that I took a second look at the bill when the server gave it to us.  The lunch special selection is so extensive that my friend n I could not decide bc of too many great choices. Well we will be coming back again n again to try everything;)"}
{"text":"I needed a spot for a business lunch and saw this spot.  This was a great surprise, food Awesome! Service AWESOME!  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! A friend recommended that I try it so I stopped by to grab lunch. I was on a rush so I ordered my food to go, but even though I didn't dine in I was still impressed. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. I would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Thai food can be found all over town but this place has some best I've had in Vegas.  Thai soup is excellent & combination fried rice is awesome."}
{"text":"Sometimes they have good Pad Thai and sometimes they don't.  I hate when a restaurant is inconsistent!!  The service is decent and I like that they deliver when I'm to tired to go out.  The lemon chicken is good.  Haven't tried much else.  It's okay..."}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai food I am very picky since I was raised on Thai and Lao food. Panna Thai, you were great! The food was exceptional and authentic to me. I always compare my Thai food to my mothers home cooking and Panna Thai did a great job!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable service & food!!  I'm in Vegas for work.  I'm using Uber so I have no car.  ALL other Thai restaurants would not deliver at 9:30pm due to closing at 10pm.  But this place DID without hesitation.  Delicious chicken satay & amazing peanut sauce.  So happy with this restaurant.  I also order the fresh rolls & fried rice.  All super delish.  Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have food allergies but love eating out. They always take care of me and keep the \"can't haves\" away from my food. I love their chicken pad Thai! If I had the money I would eat here everyday! The best part about this place is the fast delivery and you can order online/in app. That's right, I love this place so much I downloaded their app! Lol. We dine in every now and then but with a new baby delivery is just better if the baby is fussy. Great place with great staff. Would (and do) recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The server recommended Crispy Tofu & Eggplant... AMAZING! Curry was also good, but the Tom Ka Soup was PERFECT! Great job Chef"}
{"text":"Americanized. Everything is very sweet. Ordered the Pad See-Ew, Tom Yum soup, and the Beef salad. Decent price, although I have to compliment their interior. Very modern and clean."}
{"text":"My sons absolutely love the Sa Te six skewer dinner very spicy and I enjoy the green curry with chicken and spicy basil sliced chicken medium spice perfect"}
{"text":"Outline: Very slow service, iffy food.  Ok, I gave it 4 tries. This time it really did it.   I would give three stars for food. Here is why: I don't think it's anything great, but it's not too bad either. Although yesterday my husband refused to finish any of the dishes and my 3 year old is literally throwing up as I write this. Last night he had fried rice and soup (she hadn't eaten anything else for dinner - very slim chance of a coincidence).  All four times I've been there, it takes 40 minutes to an hour + to get done. And we are usually \"fast\" eaters. We sit down, we know what we want, we eat, and we're out. We go out every day and don't have time to sit around and talk like some people do.  Ok, I can understand that also, but when it takes 10 minutes between asking for a check and actually getting one there is something wrong here. My husband had already left by then as my 3 year old had enough of sitting there that long. Good thing I paid with cash or I wouldn't be able to wait for another 10 minutes for them to run a card.  As much as I want to like it, I can't, and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. The chicken at this place is good quality, white breast meat. RAD !"}
{"text":"Super friendly, open late (til 10pm), amazing tofu pad Thai, and they cater to vegans. Happy girl! Glad it's so close to home."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant and I'm always treated wonderfully here. I've been going for several years now and it's definitely my favorite Thai restaurant. One of my favorite things is that you can get the lunch specials with fried rice because most Thai restaurants in Las Vegas will only give you white rice, when you order for just one person.   I love the dishes and some of my favorites are the pad see ew, bbq spare ribs, salmon, beef and chicken skewers. I also highly recommend you try substituting Chinese broccoli instead of regular broccoli on many of the dishes and soups.  Last but not least, the waitresses are so beautiful and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered from here several times and there has NEVER been a issue. The food is excellent and fresh and the delivery service is prompt. We ordered the combo satay, spring rolls and pad thai. Everything was fresh, packaged nicely and delicious. I must recommend the spring rolls especially because of just how well made they were. The satay came with rice and the best peanut sauce I've ever eaten. There literally isn't one negative thing i can say. I highly recommend Panna Thai!"}
{"text":"Very nice customer service and delicious food. I wont tell why but you have to come and try it and youll see what im talking about! Trust me it is the best thai restaurant i have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating our anniversary on New Years night and thought this restaurant was the perfect spot. I was wrong.   We entered the restaurant with no issue as we were seated right away. And that's when everything went wrong. The waitress took a long while to get our order,  and when we were ready, my girlfriend asked if we can have all our orders delivered at the same time. This is because her main dish was tom kha kai which tends to come in first because they're served as an appetizer. She also ordered pineapple fried rice with that because that's how she enjoys the soup. Back to the order, when she asked the waitress if all our food be delivered at the same time, the rep retorted a not-so-reassuring, \"Uhm... I hope so.\" She chuckled and walked away. Experiencing was displeasing as if they weren't even going to try and make it happen.  We waited a while for our food to come in, and guess what? They all came in separately. First, it was the chicken satay which we ate pretty quickly. Then we got the soup and my noodle entree. My girlfriend tried waiting for the fried rice when she realized that her soup was getting cold. Very displeasing to see her not eat with me. At that point, she started eating the soup and thinking twice about the other order that was still late. So she went up to another server to tell them that she didn't want that order anymore.   The food was very basic. Nothing about it stood in mind. My noodles lacked a little bit of sauce as it appeared dry. The satay was rubbery and the peanut sauce that went along with it was bland. My girlfriend liked her soup but was not impressed about the mushroom used with it. Still, it hit the spot.   Overall, would we come back for a second round? No. The restaurant was courteous enough to give us a 10% off discount for the trouble, which was surprising because it didn't really seem like they cared from the beginning. Anyway, we're too paranoid for repeated offender so I think we'll pass this restaurant and go somewhere else."}
