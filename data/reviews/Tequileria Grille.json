{"text":"Wow. 10.79 for a 20oz beer. Won't be back. I understand it is at the airport, but Jesus Christ it's a draft beer. Ridiculous. Won't come back here   Got nachos as with with the pork. They were ok. Kind of bland. Plus I got them before my drink. Sad service."}
{"text":"0 stars.  They make me select a star to finalize the rating. Ordered  Nachos with chicken.  While there was a lot of chicken - it was all dark meat and I think some gizzard type meat.  Worst airport food ever."}
{"text":"Spicy Ranchero Chicken Tacos were cold, dry and the tortillas were soggy and gross.  They didn't even cook the tortillas, it's as if they just put them in a microwave. Even taking the chicken out of the nasty tortillas adding salsa and cilantro couldn't help the dryness."}
{"text":"Standard airport. Guacamole was store bought. The best thing is the frozen pre-made drinks ;)"}
{"text":"Service was fairly quick and the attendant nice,  however I ordered and was charged for a chicken burrito but the burrito I got had barely any,  if any meat on it at all... It was quite likely a vegetarian burrito :("}
{"text":"Worse Nachos ever.  Poured on cheese, not hot, bad chips.  Ok beer selection but did not have everything printed on the menu"}
{"text":"I had the barbacoa breakfast burrito before an early morning flight. At nearly $15, I was hoping to be wowed. Let's just say, I wasn't. The food was fresh enough, that was it's primary benefit. I realized it had beans a couple minutes after it was ordered and asked if I could get it without beans. I told them if they'd already made it, that was fine. They told me it was already made. If it was already made though, why did I wait five more minutes for it to come out of the kitchen. The barbacoa leaked grease through its foil wrapper and puddled on the table (no plate was provided).  Despite all that grease, it was oddly flavorless for barbacoa. None of the complex flavors I would hope it would have. The burrito was also poorly constructed so that all the barbacoa was at one end, all the eggs at the other, be in the middle a mash up of a smattering of crema, pico, and beans. In the end, I gave up trying to eat it as a burrito halfway through and ate the filling with a fork. Bottom line: way too pricey for what it is, even with the giant burrito."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced, although that is to be expected when eating at an airport. However, the margaritas were strong, the quesadillas were flavorful and a decent size portion, and the service was excellent. Establishment was clean and well space and there was no wait time although they were busy. My only real complaint is that paying $14 for vegetable quesadillas with no meat seems a little steep, however I was OK with this considering options are limited when you're waiting for your flight. I would recommend this place if you are not on a strict budget."}
{"text":"This is the fast food side. Be sure to open the box and check your meal before you walk away. I ordered 3 tacos and asked for corn tortillas, they subbed flour without telling me. Not OK. I went back, they told me they ran out of corn tortillas. They could have told me that up front. And where are the sweet pickled onions? Maybe they ran out of those too? Over salted carnitas and dry chicken with chopped tomatoes, onions, and cilantro."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, wait until you get home. Classic desert Vegas food, crappy. I wouldn't give it another chance. Why can't airports like these just have a Chipotle?! I would really like to know if this is what they think is good or if the burrito-ist was having a bad day and they bought the wrong kind of meat of the truck it came in on...   Not worth my time. I was looking for a good Mexican American meal after a long trip of back Fijian food and I was utterly disappointed and so was my wife with her tacos. We should have know Vegas isn't a place to get good food. It's always over-talked food from some truck in the desert. Sorry, but its true!"}
{"text":"Pathetic service, bad food and pricey. Not recommended at all. Save your money for better food."}
{"text":"Finding vegan options in an airport can be very challenging. After looking for all of B and C terminals, Tequileria Grille looked like the best option because they actually used the word \"vegan\" on their menu. You have the option of getting the veggie selection as tacos or a burrito. I went the burrito route and it was better good. It was better than most airport veggie burritos. But the one negative surprise was that it had cooked black beans and refried beans. Not sure why you would put whole cooked beans with processed (and tortured) refried beans into the same burrito."}
{"text":"It's average for airport food. No way it would survive if there weren't limited selection like at an airport. That said, things just seemed a little off. Like unclean (not sure if that's the word) I guess.   Anyways I'm downgrading from 3- to 2-Star because I had a pretty poor experience. I ordered a burrito - which came with sour cream on the menu. When the food came there was no sour cream so I asked if they could bring me some sour cream when they got a chance. So the waitress told me that I \"wasn't in her section so she would have to find him.\" So after they found him, found out that he had put it onto the bill as an add-on. Even though it was clearly listed as part of the meal. I'm not going to argue about a $2 charge especially when I'm running behind and have to catch a flight. But still shady.  Bottom line: find something else unless you're super pressed for time at the airport."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant during a layover on my way to St. Louis. Ordered the pork carnitas tacos, corn tortillas with pico de gallo, cilantro, pickled onion and salsa. You get 3 large tacos, with a lot of meat, for $12.99. Definitely pricey but the carnitas were very moist. They could use a little more flavor/spices but overall these were pretty good. I'm from SoCal and love my authenric Mexican food so I'm pretty picky. I give these a 3.5 out of 5. This is a solid tex-mex option when you're at the airport."}
{"text":"*Tequileria Grill*.. clever name for this Mexican Bar-Restaurant!   I dropped by here last weekend after seeking some drinks upon arrival into Las Vegas, while waiting for my ride.   This is located inside the McCarran International Airport near Gate C7 which is perfect for those looking for a full bar, or Mexican food as this has it all.   DRINK: *Ultimate Margarita*... Cadillac Margarita.. MmMMm ;D  The server had awesome service with his attentiveness and also gave us space which was a good impression. The atmosphere is great and I would recommend this for those curious about this Tex-Mex spot. 4 Stars.~"}
{"text":"This restaurant I have to say has very poor staff they're staff has no respect for they're customers. As soon as my family of five walked in the restaurant we found a table of four so my sister simply found an unclaimed chair and moved it to the end of the table of four to make it a table of five. When this happened a waiter stopped looked at my sister and abruptly said \"from now on make sure it is closely tucked in with the table so waitresses have plenty of room to get through.\" Even though the isle had to be three and a half feet wide. After this the waitress just waited for the chair to be scooted in and when it was she didn't even have the decency to say thank you. After this we  realized they had stopped serving breakfast so we told the waiters that we were gonna go look at a place that serves breakfast all day but the waiter said that no place served breakfast all day, when in fact there was two places that served breakfast all day. After we finished our food and it was all payed for my father accidentally forgot to give the pen back so once again the  was abrupt and said \"sir my pen.\" My dad said sorry gave the pen back, and the waitress couldn't even say please or thank you."}
{"text":"For airport food, this place was really good but don't sit next to the service bar because you'll hear all the employee conversations like you don't exist.   I had 3 pork tacos that were tasty and a margarita that was stiffer than I expected! Can't complain. Also, I guess you can take you alcoholic drinks on a to go cup and walk around the airport with it but you can't take it on a southwest flight."}
{"text":"WORST food EVER the tacos were fake and cold ! Don't eat here and the service even worst the cashier was worst!! Juniecel was too busy talking to her boyfriend to even greet us I guess her conversation was more important than paying customers. 30.67 for 6 cold tacos was a waste and a rip off wish I could give them a Zero star!! Barf land what an insult to Mexican food"}
{"text":"Two stars in the outside world, but three for airport food, and that has to be on a different scale because it's airport food and we all know it's going to be terrible. That said, wow did this place bother me. First let me tell you how much I hate it when people attach themselves to some random word in another language and then use it as a plaything because for anyone who speaks English, all other languages are not real and therefore available for slinging and throwing around, even though it makes you sound like you have Tourette's if you just randomly shout out a word that actually means something to speakers of the other language.  Anyway, that complaint up there is linked to my first photo here, which is of the overhang above their to-go counter: \"to-golé!\" First, get out of here. Second, since I am expert at translating inanities, that is obviously a play on the Spanish expression \"¡Olé!\" Funny enough, though, there is a difference between Spanish the language and Spanish the adjective referring to the nation of Spain, and \"olé\" is a Spanish expression USED IN SPAIN.   Not in Mexico.  Just to clarify, Mexico is a country in North America whence come tacos, while Spain is a country in Europe whence came conquistadors who created Mexico.  Clear?  Obviously not to the HMSHost family of restaurants (or, like, tons of other people outside the restaurant industry, to be fair), who tried to make a fun, cute play on words that relies on having less of an understanding of Mexican Things 101 than Trump.  I guess I am not surprised by that, because when I sat down and ordered food (hello, I CAN'T choose not to eat somewhere if it's vaguely edible, I'm a celiac in an AIRPORT, for pete's sake), the waiter asked if I wanted it \"Mexican style or American style?\" Seeing my expression, which was a mix of shock and horror, he pointed to the menu, which I unfortunately forgot to photograph, and pointed to a line that explains that you can order your tacos \"Mexican style\" - pickled veggies and pico - or \"American style\" - lettuce and cheese. Obviously I can't see my own face, but I'm pretty sure that after my shock and horror expression, my next one was some kind of mix of \"I hate everything about this\" and \"I'm judging you\" and \"I'm sorry that this is your job.\"   Now the kicker: So as I said, I ordered some \"Mexican-style\" chicken tacos, because those are pretty impossible to screw up. Now, not 90 seconds later--  That's right, FEWER THAN 90 SECONDS LATER, maybe even fewer than 60--  my plate of tacos is handed to me.  And by \"my plate of tacos\" what I obviously mean is \"a plate that was already made and then had my 'Mexican-style' toppings tossed on.\"  I am willing to debase myself with cheap food when times call for it, and airport times do call for it, and I'm not too demanding a foodie, but I have never eaten chicken so dry that I actually had to call it that. Like, not \"this chicken was cooked a bit over\" or \"this chicken could stand to be moister\" but actually \"I am a person who ALWAYS cleans her plate and I literally cannot tonight because this dry chicken is stabbing my throat.\"  And that is the story of my experience at Tequileria."}
{"text":"OMG if you are starving, my advice would be keep starving, don't do it. Stay away, oh my goodness. The servers working here seemed like they hated life and this was a low point for taking this job. My bf ordered a chimichanga, #1 eww #2 the beans were the worse ive ever tasted. The rice well also eww, I dont know how that happened.  I was afraid to order anything, but I ordered a bowl of tortillas soup. Safe enough right? WRONG, it was like thick and silmy-ish, COLD. I finally flagged down the server and asked him if he could heat it in the microwave.  He said yes and took it. Came back 10 minutes later and said  \"we dont have a microwave here, so I gave you a new soup\" I was like ummm thank you..... LIES, all the food looked beyond gross and it looked like it was froze first. NO microwave?  I call BS I couldnt eat it. SAve yourself and your money. I throw up right after I felt horrible"}
{"text":"We had a veggie burrito. The bread was not fresh at all. The content of the Barito had no flavor whatsoever. One would think that for the amount they charge for their burrito, the food would be decent to say the least."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Had their tacos American style, I might have well just ordered a salad. They put so much lettuce on it you can barely taste the un-seasoned dry chicken they put underneath. They advertise putting cheese on it but they only put a few shreds.   The one star added is for the good service."}
{"text":"Me and two friends walked into this place at 9:30pm on Sunday April 1st, 2018.  Our goal was to order a few beers while we waited for a flight.  There was a sign that said \"Please seat yourself\" so we found a table near the bar.   There was no server in sight and we found a little set of buttons on a plastic table tent to request service.   I pressed the button and we waited....and waited...and waited.  We pulled out a deck of cards and started playing a game of Hearts.   At 9:50pm,  a waitress walked up to our table and asked us what we were doing.   We tried to order and she told us that the kitchen ordered her to not take any more orders and that she could get us beers to go.  We explained that we'd be waiting for 20 minutes,  pressing the service button every few minutes.  She told us that she didn't know what the button was and that playing cards in a bar was illegal...what?! This woman seemed to be on her very last nerve and would do anything to get us out for her own convenience. We left and I decided to pop back in a little later to snap some pics as evidence.  Weird place."}
{"text":"This place is below-average, overpriced basic tex-mex. Whatever you do, don't order the $11 guacamole. It is definitely pre-packaged, completely mushy and flavorless. The chips are terrible. The chimichanga was ok and the carnitas tacos were decent. The meat had a good flavor. Beans and rice are not good."}
{"text":"It was by far the better place you can find in Vegas airport when you don't want to eat Burger King or sbarros. I had veg bowl it was okay not bad, liked their medium spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place! Its like any other Tex-Mex place in an airport serving mediocre quality drinks and food at a hefty price! Our flight got delayed and so we had quite a lot of time to kill. We got some margaritas and chips and salsa and they were all A-OK! Our waitress was nice, which I think was the only plus point!"}
{"text":"It's the only real sit down place at the end of Terminal C.   You want to catch a bit of the game before your flight or just set your bag down next to you and not eat in an armchair next to your gate, then you come here. And it will be just as bad as you expect it to be. Overpriced, meh fair. The service is slow and often times seems confused on orders. But you are sitting, so at least you have that going for you.  I will say the food I've had there is hot and relatively fast. I personally like the Chimichanga. If you're in a rush to catch your plane though, you'd better ask for your check before you start eating. They haven't seemed to figure out that people eating at the airport more than likely have to catch a flight, so speed on check delivery and cashing should be pretty high priority."}
{"text":"Remodeled and got rid of all their outlets. Nice. The food is so bland. No flavor. Ordered slow cooked shredded pork tacos. Dry, I don't think they add any spices to the food. Salsa is blah,  No flavor either. I remember it being much better. They cut back on quality.. I won't come back when I travel through airport ever again."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat Mexican food.... Food expensive  Taste awful Ordered the chips and guacamole.. guacamole it's not authentic  Chicken enchiladas ok  Not worth my money.   Do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. One of the unfortunate realities about this airport is the layout, and the strange way that eating and drinking establishments seem to be randomly sprinkled throughout the terminals. I came here seeking lunch while en route to the East Coast from LA. I made the mistake of stopping in to get a chicken burrito to go, made \"American style.\" It might have been a sad joke, maybe I should have gotten it \"Mexican style\" but alas. The chicken was dry and unseasoned and the salsa didn't do much to help. Shredded lettuce was horrible. The burrito itself was cold. No burritos should ever be cold. Nobody should be subjected to this. Also, it was almost $20!? Possibly the worst burrito I've ever eaten in my life. Save your dollars and your time. Find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the tortilla soup ($6.99). Not the biggest cup but very tasty. Corn, beans and tortilla strips in a nice broth. I added some hot sauce and it did the trick. No drink included but it is Christmas Day and I needed some food to keep me going on an 8 hour travel day.  If you're in a hurry and want a tasty snack give this place a try."}
{"text":"Since I was getting Mexican food in Las Vegas, I figure it would be at least decent. I was wrong about that. I got a carne asada burrito. The seasoning was great but the meat was overcooked and was dry and tough to chew. The service was terrible too. Upon calling out that my order was ready, I asked for some salsa. They were out of the one I wanted so the woman told me the other 2 available ones they had. She didn't even give me 10 seconds to decide and started helping the next customer. There wasn't any line, only one person. I tried to get her attention after completing their order but she ignored me. Lastly for the overall rating of the food and service, the food cost was almost double what you spend at most fast casual.  In summary: Mediocre food = -1 star Bad customer service  = -1 star Overpriced = -1 star  Therefore 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is terrible. Seriously! Do yourself a favor and eat at an airport Burger King if you want a better meal. This place was so gross."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito from here that was massive and delicious! I don't know about the other menu items, but breakfast is where it's at."}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast. I order the classic eggs with steak. They gave me steak strip and the breakfast potato was so over cook that it is hard. I ask for a1 sauce and they have none.   The steak was dry and tough because it was strips and just cooked badly. I choked it down with some bread. Only thing eatable was the eggs and toast.   I had to flag down a waitress for waterafter I finished my juice. My waitress was standing right there and  just ignore me completely.  She had trouble hearing me.  Do not go to this place."}
{"text":"Stop here for breakfast, menu looked simple and tasty.  That was a lie. Coffee was pretty much warm colored water, the sliced grilled steak and eggs came out to what I know as shredded beef, or what the waiters say it is a miss print the \"sliced grilled steak\" is Barbacoa... Really? Horrible taste all around"}
{"text":"Extremely rude, not friendly at all.  They have zero knowledge on how to interact with customers."}
{"text":"I love checking out airport food.  When in Vegas waiting for departure, this was close to my gate and not crowded, so I gave it a whirl. I ordered the fish tacos from Jim, who was great.  It came with rice and beans.  The fish tacos were okay, but the rice and beans were very underwhelming.  Both were too dry.    I hung around a little while, watched some football and listened to the drunk woman next to me. All-in-all, my meal didn't do much for me and next time I'll probably pass this place by."}
{"text":"Just like any other airport restaurant.. Expensive and not very good.   Boyfriend ate one taco and left the other two. Even my quesadilla wasn't even warmed through. How does that even happen? Don't you have to melt cheese, therefore it should be hot? Weird.   We both ordered Blue Moons but they were served to us in dirty glasses and they're from a can. BTW in case you haven't got the luxury of trying Blue Moon in a can it is effin' gross.   $50 for this meal. I would have rather ate fast food.  They did have an extensive bar selection and Pokestops for our nerdy entertainment haha so add one star."}
{"text":"This place was terrible and tasted like everything was out of a can. I could have made better food at home. The chips are very salty and have to be straight out the bag. Our waiter was very unfocused. The cheese was not even melted in the burrito. Nothing special about this place at all."}
{"text":"Food here is awfulness served with death. The beans taste like dirt and spice. The huevos rancheros we're watered down salsa with old tortilla and potatoes. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here and thought the burrito was really good. I got the vegan burrito Mexican style and it taste really fresh and tasty. Along with a beer or filled me up and hit the spot. The waitress was really nice and checked I. On me several times. Yeah it wasn't cheap but it is at an airport what do you expect... also it was really good for airport food.."}
{"text":"I had a long wait at the airport so I decided to have dinner here instead of doing something fast.  You seat yourself and then the waitress comes over.  I only waited for a few minutes for someone to come by. She took my drink order and then came back with the drink and took my dinner order.  I had the fish tacos.  They had a nice breaded fish in them, lots of cabbages and other toppings.  Nice chips and salsa too.  Not too bad for an airport restaurant.  I definitely will be back if I have time during another airport visit."}
{"text":"Stopped there on the way home. Had a burger & fries and it was fine. The waitress was just fantastic! Very nice. Service excellent."}
{"text":"ok so I like the button contraption for service and paying.  foods still poor quality and why the rush ! 0930 in the a.m. the place is not busy and the demand to pay is insulting."}
{"text":"More like 3.5. I got the vegan taco option. Pretty good for the Vegas airport."}
{"text":"Kids and I went here super hungry. Nachos were more than enough for my eldest 15 yo son and I. Kids got virgin margaritas and were super happy. Solid place for airport food. Quick service"}
