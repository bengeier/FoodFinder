{"text":"I'll have to agree with the other rating that they don't deserve one star. The customer service makes me want to go elsewhere. Food isn't that great, constantly out of stuff, they pile up the styrofoam boxes around the work area and plaster the window to watch them work with paper menus that are redundant. They work on one item at a time before they help the next customer. I usually just grab something to drink here, so they get a star for that."}
{"text":"If you work for this company and sitting in the yard this is the only place to eat unless you leave the property.  The food is okay,  nothing to boast about."}
{"text":"Only gave them one star because you cant give them zero. Rude personnel, the manager clearly doesnt care about the bad customer service. the menu is limited and the food is edible, most of it anyway.  Save yourself and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Horrible place. I worked here for two weeks almost 3 years ago I was 5 months pregnant and the manager told me on a night shift I had to cut a large block of cheese which was way more than 20 pounds. I knew you shouldn't lift being pregnant and i told him later i got the list stating cheese needed to be grated so i didn't wanna lose my job so i lifted this heavy block of cheese to grate and realized it was a bad idea immediately i got sharp shooting pain in my abdomen i had to sit outside for a while because i hurt too much, when i reported this next day i was informed to file workman's comp so i did and got checked out. I was out for a week recovering and when i made calls and texts trying to get back to work my boss intentionally ignored my texts and calls and never returned my voicemails and week after these attempts i made one last text asking to come back to work and he finally text back saying my skills were exaggerated you're no longer an employee here. I was in shock and couldn't believe he fired me after the workman's comp and used thus as an excuse and not contacting me for a week after I made numerous attempts. I've worked in food all my life and have been a cook I know my skills but apparently me being pregnant and filing for workman's comp after getting injured for lifting a 50 lbs block of cheese cause I was instructed to do so was enough to fire me, I should have filed a lawsuit but I didn't know any better, this place had no morals and not even good food. Stay away"}
