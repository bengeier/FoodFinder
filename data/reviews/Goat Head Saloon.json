 Stan.E. LD for Screaming Ant!"}
{"text":"I love live music, I dont know why this is my first time here, cool place, GREAT stage, I have to say I really liked it, stayed for a couple of drinks, left before the Elton John tribute started (not a fan) I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is probably the best designed live-music-bar venue in the valley. (Hurts to hear that it's in Mesa, doesn't it?) You can really be close to the band; there are plenty of tables. The bar area is separate, but still has a great view. The acoustics are good. 

~If you think it's too loud, it's because you'd rather hear yourself than the music. There are breaks between sets, or you can go outside and smoke if you want to be heard above the band.

The only reason this venue does not get 5 stars is because my friends band was bumped. We sat around for hours waiting to go on stage. From what I understand, this wouldn't have happened if the owner was there, but he wasn't. So my friends had to play last. By that time we were all tired and we had given up on making it a great show. It was more like a jam session for us than it was like doing a show, because by that time we didn't care what other people thought."}
{"text":"Jason is one of the biggest assholes on the planet! I have never been treated, or spoken to by a bar owner the way Jason addressed me. Fuck that bald headed little idiot! I'm glad his shitty bar closed!"}
{"text":"I think that the filtered reviews are spot on. The regulars talk shit the entire night and won't leave you alone. The sound sucks and the beer was flat. 4 Peaks should be fresh as it comes from a local brewery. The only reason I was there was to get in on the blues jam on Sunday night. Almost got into a fight with the regular. Finally left when I couldn't take any more."}
{"text":"I had never heard of the Goat Head until last night. A friend's band was playing and we decided to head over and check it out. I'm glad we did! Tucked away in a tiny strip mall, the Goat Head offers the right amount of \"dive\", is a good size, and has a friendly staff. We got there just early enough that we didn't have to pay the cover ($5) and got a table near the front to settle in for the band. The stage is a good size and the overall layout of the bar is perfect. My only complaint was that it took quite a while to get a drink at the bar, but everyone was friendly and having a good time. I'd definitely head back to the Goat if there was a band playing there I wanted to see."}
{"text":"Sure, it's in a very random strip mall.  Sure, it's got a genre bending name.  

You're not there for an artisanal cocktail.  You're not there for a wood fired pizza.  You're definitely not there to see or be seen, or show off you're latest Prada sweater.  

But, if you're on the East side and want to hide out and grab a stiff drink at a no-BS bar - this is a worthy joint indeed.  What makes it so are 2 things - interior character and an amazing sound stage for live music.  The latter fact alone should compel a visit - the stage is so good they could make a bad band sound professional - trust me!

So, shake off your pretense and catch a good local band - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's hard to rate this place!!!
One time I go to the goat and Have a great time...the next time I go I fear getting shanked by the locals who r really giving you  the stair down. Its a totall hit are miss with this place.
They do have good live music at times, but the cover charge is usually way to high and it's not like they have cheap drinks either.
The place has great potential it is just not being used to its fullest."}
{"text":"Food was good, drinks were reasonable, but last night  the Whiskey Tango band was terrible."}
{"text":"Don't do it!! I should have left when the foul smell hit me before I made it to the door! The staff was not rude and the beer was cold and well priced but the lack of decent food, zero ambiance and stench will keep we from giving it another try."}
{"text":"There was almost nothing I liked about this place, other than my friends band that was playing."}
{"text":"GIve me a BREAK all you phony ppl!! This dive bar has the BEST selection  of music and the greatest lady behind the bar: Georgia!!

You may be thinking I'm biased but I was as skeptical as you WOULD be when a friend suggested it after dinner. It was Thursday night and we had the place almost for ourselves. The regular music selection was AMAZING! and Georgia made our night even better being as any bartender should be, friendly, helpful with the drinks and even talking. I smell we might have a new couchsurfer!!!

Yes  the place might not have the best restrooms, bur really??? how many hours you spend inside?."}
{"text":"Four stalls in the ladies' room and two had out-of-order signs on them, one had a shower curtain in place of a door, and the one remaining in working order with a door had no t.p. at 8:00 pm."}
{"text":"Im gonna give it 3 stars because the food is pretty decent for bar food.  I know.. strange, but it was yummy.

A tip for those who are designated drivers..  they dont serve Coke products, but rather Coke-like..a nonbrand soda that they m ix in with the drinks. I asked for a Sprite and it was naaaasty..  I opted for water.  

The bands they had were pretty good, but the sound system is not too geat.  the mix was really off and the highs were too highs and not enough base.  You could barely here the vocals at times and when you did the feedback started.  

It's an over all cool looking place and Id go back if friends wanted to, but this wouldnt be my first choice."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the bar tender that night was a hairy Gash. She treated me with disrespect and my party I was with also. I was there to play a gig that night, so I was drinking water. I had asked her in-between sets to refill my Pitcher with Ice and Water and each time she got more annoyed with me drinking water, or putting her out-how dare she do her job.

The stage is adequate for a four piece band. Storm was in charge of the sound system and he dialed EVERYTHING in perfectly (Thanks Storm).

We got there early before folks started showing up so we could sound check. There's a lounge lizard with an Amazing rack, slamming body. But she's a hooker, and her pimp was sitting at the back of the bar, and jaw wagging with \"The Gash\" all night.

The hooker made her way around all of my crew, and our Girlfriends begging for money, begging for drinks. She fell to the ground at least 4 times while just walking around. Her F'me pumps I guess were too much for her, she's better off staying on her back.

Our roadie was cornered in the bathroom by the \"Pimp\" and was told he will buy some coke off of him, my roadie just pushed past him and told the pimp to eat a fat one.

I walked into the bathroom earlier and witnessed the \"Pimp\" cutting up some coke for a dude that was in there with them, they were cutting it up on the sink! YUK!

They were not startled or shocked by my entrance and disturbing their transaction. They both looked up at me, then went back to business. Needless to say I had to go back on stage with dirty dick hands because the sink was \"in use\"

About half way through the night Phoenix PD stormed in and the pimp ran out through the kitchen, yes I saw the pimp jet, and I personally directed Phoenix's finest after this scumbag.

They want you to sell tickets to your followers, we don't charge our fans or friends to come watch us. So needless to say we put on a wicked kick ass show, and we were paid $25. This place rapes its bands, bar tender was a rotten Gash. Can't really knock the interior, it's a dive bar ran by a Dumpster diving Gash."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to just hangout and drink and we found it. We went there yesterday (Monday) and there were only a couple of other people in there besides our group of three. The selection on the jukebox was decent and we were able to find music that we wanted to listen to. Georgia is a great bartender and was so friendly and nice. It was a good night."}
