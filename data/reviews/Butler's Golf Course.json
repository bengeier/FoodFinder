{"text":"Probably the most played public golf courses in Western Pa, The Woodside and Lakeside at Butlers' are always in excellent condition, but not manicured.
Green fees are more expensive than other courses if the same caliber. The employees are not pleasant usually, especially the ladies working in the pro shop.
The Woodside's final 4 finishing holes are especially a challenge."}
{"text":"This is my usual spot for golf. They have two courses, Wood side and Lake side. Both are kept really well...even during this rainy summer they are not totally flooded and you still can golf with ease.
Prices are reasonable! Best deal is Twilight golf. Nine holes for $18 with a cart. They also have different passes available to purchase. I have the twilight pass which is $169. Good entire calendar year. You pay for cart each time ($7) or walk for no extra charge. What I never understand here and other course is if I get a cart, it's $7 (here), but if my friend golfs with me in my cart it's $7 additional. We could both get our own carts, however I feel like if you share the cart, it should be discounted between the two. Anyways...I'd like to think I'd walk, but who would hold my beer?
Drinks are priced well and they have some great food. Wing night, daily specials on drinks and food. The decor is older, but the service is great. Pro shop has a small selection...more ladies' stuff than typical pro shops. I always wonder why they don't have more ladies' apparel. We shop!
Lots of clinics and event nights to get new golfers in and plenty of leagues. 
What I really like about this course is that it's really women friendly. Some courses still haven't realized that Title IX is in place. Butler's is with the times on this. Grab your driver and hit a few rounds at this place."}
{"text":"Do not come here unless you want to play a 6.5 hour round of golf for 50 bucks. Greens are torn up. Cart paths are destroyed, tee boxes are the same as the rough.. one of the worst public courses around here. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Played in a golf outing here to benefit a friends family.  First, the staff here was extremely personable, friendly and willing to help our group in any way they could.  Whether it was the pro's, rangers, the golf shop team or the bartenders, they did an amazing job with our 70+ group.  A big thank you to all of them for going above and beyond to make our event extremely successful.

The golf course has 2 sets of 18 hole courses.  We played the Lakeside course.  This set of 18 is not a course you can walk, at least not in my opinion.  It takes a long time to get from hole 9 to hole 10 and from 18 back to the clubhouse.  The course is not overly long and is quite wide open which allows mediocre hackers like myself to score well.  This makes it fun to play.  There are some challenging holes and some water around the course.  Hey, it is the lakeside course after all.  Lots of great views along the course, in particular around the back 9.  Overall the course was in great shape, though some of the bunkers could use some work but hey, who wants to be in there anyway, right?

This is a great course and I will certainly come back again."}
