{"text":"They have very good food and one of my favorite place  to go. I love there crispy pan fried noodle the best.."}
{"text":"Worst customer service in the world, after placed the order for half hour, ask an elder waitress how was everything going. Somehow she claimed she is the boss, and yelled at us : you guys either wait or get out right now!! She exactly said Get Out Right Now!!! WTF!!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent and reasonably priced.  I am always happy to have a good restaurant in the area.  It's been a long time since I've been to a good Chinese restaurant.  We tried the Garlic Chicken & it was so delicious.  We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????? The waiter for this resturtatant is sooooooooooooo stupid"}
{"text":"My husband usually has to drag me to a Chinese restaurant. This place is AMAZING! The spring rolls came out perfect! Not greasy like most places! I ordered the Kung Pow Chicken with egg drop soup. It was just as Amazing! The staff is so nice and courteous. This is now my new favorite place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Mesa for 4 years. I haven't found any good Egg Foo Young. Finally, I found the Green Tea Bistro. Although it was a 25 minute ride, it was worth it. I totally enjoyed it. We also ordered the lettuce wraps and I thought they were pretty good. I ate my sons leftover pepper steak the next day, and I liked that too. I will def be going back. I totally recommend this place if your looking for good authentic Egg Foo Young."}
{"text":"Originally, I was non-plussed about ordering from here, despite the great reviews and my husband's insistence. But my hubs has great taste, so I trusted his instincts. As always, he was right.  The Break Down:  We ordered online an orange chicken combo (wonton soup, rice, and egg roll) and shrimp chow fun, plus brown rice, for delivery. The website estimates delivery times will take 45 minutes to an hour, and it took a solid 45 minutes, so I wasn't unhappy about that - they were true to their words. For 6:30 on a Saturday, I thought that was super reasonable.  Now here's the thing: The other reviewers are totally right - GTB serves authentic Chinese food. Since it's authentic, it's dog-diggity tasty. Hands down, the best wonton soup of my life; tasteable sesame oil, flavorful, delicious pork in the wontons, plenty of fresh green onions (my favorite part)--it was a layered, delicious soup that I will happily order literally for forever. The orange chicken was cooked beautifully--saucy without being gross, not too spicy, and actually tastes like orange. Win! The egg roll was crispy, hot, and stuffed with goodness. Excellent.   The chow fun. Guys, this is not a Chinese dish that you find at most fast-food Chinese restaurants (apparently). It was FABULOUS. I'd never had it before, but it's wide, flat, pad-thai like rice noodles (gluten-free win), cooked until tender, springy, and super slurpy. What a treat! This dish blew my mind.  The only downsides: The chow fun had only six pieces of shrimp in it - like normal-sized shrimp. So that was a downer. And the fried rice is NOT your normal Chinese fried rice. It's seasoned tastily and fried with egg, but has none of the standard American fare like peas, onion, etc. So that took me aback. The perfect brown rice more than made up for it though.  TLDR: Order from here. Do it. You will be delighted. I cannot wait to order from them again, though I'm now nervous at the impending relationship between my bank account and their kitchen."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get Chinese food (in my opinion)! They have great food and great service. Also, this place serves delicious yet affordable food. I would suggest Green Tea Bistro if you want to relieve your Chinese cravings! Food I would suggest the most is the dried sautéed string bean w/ minced pork!!! It is #1!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant I have ever had! The staff is very friendly, I get delivery and it arrives hot and fresh they get my order right every time, The food is so good I highly recommend them. if you haven't tried them you should give them a chance you wont regret it."}
{"text":"It mainly serves authentic Szechuan cuisine. From my past experience of Szechuan in other places including China, I will say give this one a solid 3 star due to the fact that some dishes are not authentic enough. I may go back to this place since it is clean, food and price are okay."}
{"text":"Very good truly authentic Chinese.  I find that at good authentic Chinese restaurants, they usually don't have a problem changing typically deep-fried dishes to non-deep-fried ones and this place did not disappoint--I got non-deep-fried orange chicken and it was de-lish.  Server was extremely nice and well-mannered.    I was in late near close and at the end of the night all the restaurant workers (all family?) sat down for a group meal themselves.  Kind of cool, but one suggestion...  I think this should be conducted after close or the server should probably not be a part of this meal because I felt like I had no one attending to my table at the end and I didn't want to interrupt the group meal.  Not a huge deal but others might get more upset."}
{"text":"My wife just tried the Orange Chicken and I tried the Szechuan Chicken from the Chef's specialty menu. The service was excellent (despite the Grand Opening party) and the food was divine! Additionally, the egg roll we had and Lo Mein was the best I have had in years. I do not know how they make their egg rolls and Lo Mein, but they seemed better than the norm.   The menu seemed more varied with more Chinese dishes than other Chinese restaurants in the area as well. Like others have said, the decor is plain, but hey they are just getting started. I am looking forward to eating here again at my new favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant!  Chef's Specialty Menu examples (NOT all are listed here):  Lake Tung Ting Shrimp, Scallops with XO Sauce, Salt & Pepper Squid, Perfect Match, Sizzling Squid w Black Bean Sauce, \"Green Tea\" Spicy Chicken, Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodle,  \"Green Tea\" Curry,  \"Green Tea\" Spicy Chicken Wings, Dragon & Phoenix, Green Jade Scallops, Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce, and Shredded Pork w. Peking Sauce"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The delivery person was super nice and best part I got my food less than 30 mins during lunch rush! Will be ordering here every time I want Chinese food."}
{"text":"Very clean. The staff is very friendly and the food was very good! I had the sweet and sour shrimp, great clean flavors!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for lunch with my co-workers. The food is always fresh,hot, and delicious and the service is great!  The lunch specials come with soup and you get a lot of food for the money. Love the the hot and sour soup!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  We got an assortment of items; Pan Fried Noodles with Shrimp, Sesame Chicken, Fried Potstickers, Spring Rolls, and Chicken Fried Rice.  To use, the fried rice is the key to whether or not we will order from a restaurant again.  Properly seasoned woks give it a specific flavor that we look for.  Green Tea Bistro had it.  The dumplings and spring rolls weren't greasy and had great flavor.  The sesame chicken wasn't overly sweet and the pan fried noodles were very good.  We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service.  We have only ordered to go and I pick it up on my way.  The food is always still hot when I arrive and I never have to wait once I arrive.  It is always ready on time!"}
{"text":"Best I have had in a long while. Service was great. Sad that tea is not loose leaf but Mongolian beef was yummy!"}
{"text":"This stuff is amazing! My bf and I were struggling to find a good place to get takeout during the big AZ monsoon. I said I was craving Chinese food. There you go! It was our first time trying food from here by the way. We ordered pork mushu, lettuce wraps and orange chicken.  The pork mushu was unbelievably high quality flavorful and the mushrooms in it had amazing texture.  The lettuce wraps had fillings that were also amazing and good enough to eat even by itself. The orange chicken had killer sauce. It didn't taste sickenly sweet, fake, or anything like that. Just like real food. (Trust me there are several bad orange chicken dishes but I think you already know that). I wasn't a huge fan with the texture quality of the chicken.  Will be trying again soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh meal! There were 4 of us with my aunt from California! She loved it!!"}
{"text":"Best place for some Chinese we had special beef soup with their house sauce tasty lots of flavor anybody and everybody needs to eat hear"}
{"text":"Food was watered down and bland. Got it delivered. They charge 5.00s for delivery. Tip driver 10% and still wasn't happy with my tip. Asked for more. Bad service."}
{"text":"Local, no frills, restaurant that just does it \"right\", if authentic Chinese is what you are looking for.  Simple, clean, elegant flavors applied to fresh ingredients.  Great for take-out.  I knew I was in the right place when I was the only Westerner among 40 patrons.  Yelp online ordering worked great.  Efficient and reasonable.  Good choice for Chinese."}
{"text":"My favorite ...authentic Chinese place in az since leaving east coast could not find good Chinese if you like spicy try green tea chicken"}
{"text":"As I'm writing this review I'm eating my to go chicken lo mein. I do have to say that this place can make some good noodles. They're not greasy like most other chinese food places. This is my first time eating from this place and the reviews thus far are accurate. Keep it up green tea bistro! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Get about 6 orders of the salt and pepper wings. Your welcome. I know what your thinking; \"the appetizer?!\" YEEEAH BUDDY! They make them fresh every time, even when they deliver they are perfect. Crunchy, tender, and cheaper than most, not counting \"Discount\" wing days, which I'm proud to say green tea bistro does not take part in, the wings are too good. I'd demand to pay full price regardless! It breaks down to approx. .91 cents a wing, a small price to pay for the best thing you've ever put in your mouth."}
{"text":"Tried this place on recommendation from a friend. One of my favorite dishes is twice cooked pork which they had on the menu under a different name. In talking to the waiter, I found they had a \"Chinese\" menu too and he recommended the Chinese version of the dish versus the one on their Americanized menu. We decided to try it and it was very good. Still not authentic like I have had it in China, but very good and my wife really liked it. On our visit, they were out of brown rice and the service was a little off. If not for that I would rate it higher. The service was not bad or rude or anything like that. Just a little off of what I would expect."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but a little bit pricy for students. Hope they could have some lunch special or student discount. That would be perfect."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a good Chinese restaurant in the area. Being from Seattle, I know good Chinese food, and Green Tea Bistro is a good one. The Pork Fried Rice is great. I always base my decision to like a Chinese restaurant based on their PFR. The Sweet and Sour chicken is fresh, hot and crunchy. Teriyaki Chicken is great big pieces of fresh chicken, pineapple, and green pepper, delish. The Chicken Low Mein is awesome. The Won Ton soup is good, but it only contains the wonton's (which are wonderfully made and delicious, btw) and green onions. Personally, I think it's missing the BBQ pork and a green leaf of some sort. The Beef Broccoli is great with fresh broccoli, in fact all the dishes are cooked fresh with fresh ingredients. I will continue to come here regularly. Friendly folks here, feels like a family owned place and they take pride in it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Tasty egg rolls with homemade hot mustard. I love the spicy chicken with eggplant! Great neighborhood restaurant. We have only done take out not dine in.  So far we have eaten here 4 times all were great."}
{"text":"Love this little place. The locals seem to know what's happening! Great vibe but the food is why you come here. All the traditional with a northern style."}
{"text":"If you are looking for healthy delicious Chinese food .. This is The Place!! YUM Give it try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First time here I was a great experience. The food is fresh and great tasting. I ordered Tofu and Brown rice. The dish was as aspected. Delicious! Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"FAVORITE NEW PLACE!!   Walked in 8:30pm-ish, placed an order to go.    I ordered:   chicken lettuce wraps: Absolutely delicious, lettuce came in separate bag w/ sauce on side & chicken filling in another container, not very spiced up so it was just to my liking! I couldn't stop eating them.   Beef & Broccoli: it was ok, broccoli was fresh & looked nice (it wasn't my dinner dish)  Wonton soup: \"alright\" according to person eating it. To me it was simple & to the point.   Steamed chicken w vegetable: great, vegetables looked nice & fresh, great texture, chicken was steamed to perfection, and sauce in the side was a little on the sweet side (also to my liking) Dishes come w/ rice, good rice.   The bag was packaged nicely & survived the drive home unharmed.   The restaurant had many customers even towards closing hours & had beautiful green plants (live, which I am jealous of)   If you are thinking of checking this place out, go! It was my first time here tonight & I have so much food left over & can't wait until I can eat it again."}
{"text":"Great food, cute little place, clean, friendly staff, reasonably priced, and close to my house!  I am very happy this place finally opened and has great food! This is my new go to for Chinese food.  Try this place......they have really good egg rolls.  So if you like sweet and sour chicken you should order it here.   Wow!"}
{"text":"Small unassuming sparsely decorated little place in a Safeway strip mall.  What it lacks in curb appeal it fully makes up for in price flavor and quantity.  I had the tofu chow fun, vegetable spring roll and my daughter had orange tofu.  All of the food was extremely fresh and beautifully prepared.  As someone who eats a lot of tofu this was very satisfying. The staff was very pleasant and service for takeout was fast without cutting corners.  So glad to find this local gem."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Their food is very fresh, and not as greasy as other Chinese restaurants - you don't feel like puking from a super full belly after eating a lot of great food! Give it a try! One of the best in this area!"}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese food delivery in the Mesa area. It tastes much healthier and than any other Chinese food delivery. The Lo Mein is great, along with the Vegetable Spring Rolls. I would love to try the trademark green tea, but sadly they do not deliver it. With tip and a Grubhub $7 off coupon, it usually comes out to around $7 or $8 a person."}
{"text":"YUM! You know a chinese restaurant is good when its full of Asian diners!  They have both an authentic chinese menu and an American chinese menu...food quality is always consistent and delicious.  Cant go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Servers were nice and attentive. portion size was average for price. Taste/flavor was below average. definitely not four stars  later that night had my first MSG headache"}
{"text":"Location and food was great! My hubs and I will definitely order from here again. The on-line Yelp ordering system made it easy to place an order. They just didn't seem to know where my order was when I got there, but they found it quickly, and it was ready after about 30 minutes from when I originally placed the order on-line from home."}
{"text":"Had a meeting at Dobson next to this and a colleague suggested we walk here for lunch....   We got seated in a big round table with a lazy susan in the middle...fun!  Ordered the lunch special for 6.99 and if you want egg rolls add $1...def added the egg roll (it was good)  I got the orange chicken with fried rice...very good flavor on the chicken..kinda wish that I had the white rice tho...maybe next time lol.  The service was pretty fast, food was great, price was great :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I am incredibly picky with my beef broccoli and this place is probably the best I've ever had. They have super fast delivery too. I make the trip down from Scottsdale to eat here."}
{"text":"Not bad but also not the Bomb when we take it to go, I think all Chinese food taste better when you eat it there"}
{"text":"So, it was like the worst experience ever, the waiter was super rude. I dun know why you guys hire someone like that, definitely will not visit again."}
{"text":"What a surprise! A friend of mine told me to come here and boy was I ecstatic after having eaten the food. Not only was the place packed for a Monday evening ( filled with young foreigners from China who probably know Chinese food the best), one of the employees who took our order was super kind and funny! :)   We asked for the Chinese yellow menu and skipped the common green menu because we wanted the authentic and different Chinese food with an added level of heat -- spiciness! I'm not much of a spicy eater but I actually enjoyed the entrees.   From the Hot & Spicy Style: Water boiled fish fillet with preserved vegetables.  Soft white fish, with crunchy mustard greens, some bits of hot peppers, and a thick base soup that can be eaten by itself or for me, I like to add a bit of rice to calm down the heat. I'd order this again. $14  From the Hot Pot: mixed mushrooms and tofu hot pot. This contained 3 kinds of mushrooms of which I believe were shiitake mushroom, golden needle mushroom ( a family of the enoki mushroom) and king oyster or king trumpet mushroom - which typically brings out the flavor in large stock soups. Tofu looked like it was pre-fried and when opened the inside was just as soft and delicate as it should be. Flavor is on the mild side. $10.29.   From Poultry: Spicy Chong Qing Chicken!! A generous amount of vibrant red chili peppers all over the chicken pieces. We ordered it non-fried. Extreme caution for eating this dish. I picked off some of the bits of pepper off the chicken to avoid too much numbness of the lips. Well worth eating though. $12.   One tv in restaurant. Bathroom was clean and area was surprisingly clean for a Chinese restaurant. I'm due for another visit soon... table for 10 please. :)"}
{"text":"Egg drop soup was horrible and bland.  Wait staff does not speak adequate English to understand your order, hence they screwed it up.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I keep meaning 2 yelp about this place.... Really delicious!! The walnut chicken, steamed potstickers and moo shu pork are my favorites so far. The order is always hot, complete and fresh and they're always very nice    An update 2 my previous post... Again LOVE this little place... Food is delicious.. People are lovely, what else is there 2 say... Torn about this because it was JAMMED 2day!!! Hope I'll still b able 2 get in!!! Kidding, hope they continue 2 do well.., they really deserve it... Tough business, I know... Retired f&b..."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Finally some really really good Chinese food!!! Being from California, middle California, it was difficult to find Chinese food that didn't taste like sh.... Thankfully, this place has stepped up!!! They are new, and I really really hope they don't change. It looks like they are still decorating a bit, with an empty fish tank...but you know what, my fiancée and I would probably walk over broken glass to get to this place again!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have dined here 3 - 4 times. The food merits 3.7 - 4.2 stars, which I would round to 4. There are lots of choices, and the food is flavorful. It's quiet.  I deducted one star because they refused to honor their coupon in the Entertainment book. (Businesses pay for inclusion in this book. We used the same coupon at the same restaurant last year.) However, when we questioned a couple of times why they wouldn't accept the coupon, they did give us about 50% of the value of the coupon.  We passed 4 or 5 Chinese restaurants to get there. Business owners: Honor your coupons, or don't enjoy the advertisement -- and customers -- from them! It leaves a bad taste in the customers' mouths."}
{"text":"OMG, I can't believe I was only recently introduced to this gem. Not a fancy place, but who needs that when the food is amazing! Hands down the best Chinese food I have had since Chinatown in NYC. Scallion pancakes are a MUST have. So far have tried the Happy Family, fresh veggies and your choice of meat in a delicious sauce that makes me even eat the zucchini and broccoli!  Mongolian beef was also perfectly spiced and the Shrimp in Lobster sauce was so tasty I needed extra rice for the sauce!  No dessert at this place but you'll eat so much you won't need it."}
{"text":"Okay, People of Yelp... They will custom make a dish to your preferences and your allergies!! Do you know how big a deal this is for an Authentic Asian Diner?? AND when I got there they had an equal number of white to Asian guests- good signs for good food. Decent prices, fast and attentive service with English speaking front counter and they serve green tea ice cream! Our favorite. I am definitely coming back for more delicious fresh Chinese. They were so courteous and very thorough about making our dishes according to our allergies. Have to give credit where credit's due. Give this place a shot and talk with the staff if you have questions or need help choosing from their menu. It's family owned and operated so they will do their best to keep their customers coming back."}
{"text":"I am from out of town, and was getting my tires changed across the street at Firestone. They recommended this place, and I'm glad they did! Both the food and service is outstanding! I came in with my 2 year old, and 5 month old and instead of the usual sigh and eye roll I get from servers, we all were treated with the utmost respect and kindness. This is a family run establishment who takes pride in both their service and food. Not to mention the cleanliness which is always a factor for me."}
{"text":"Was hoping to be impressed but from the get-go, not so much. Upon entering the establishment we were greeted by an elderly waitress who was not happy when I requested a table other than the one she offered to seat us at (I wanted a quieter location). So right away, not a good first impression.  The menu is decent with a good amount of options. I liked that they had a \"weight watchers\" section for the health conscious. They also offer brown and white rice, which is nice. I ordered the Chicken Eggplant Garlic dish, my husband had the Curry Chicken. Unfortunately, both lacked flavor and were just ok. This is very first time I've had chicken eggplant that was so sweet. Not a fan. With so many other restaurant options in the Valley, I think there is better food and MUCH better customer service to be had somewhere else."}
{"text":"Lunch today with the husband.  Tried this place for the first time.  Service was fast and friendly. Tried the kung pao lunch special for 5.99. Comes with choice of soup. We also had the Mongolian beef, both were very good.  I thought the portions were very big for a lunch menu. We tried both iced and hot green teas. They were good...looking gorward to trying more tea flavors. Will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food, but portions a bit on the small side."}
{"text":"This is a late review but wanted to give Green Tea bistro some kudos! Staff was friendly and accommodating and sat us promptly. I've been here for dine-in and take out and had good experiences both times. When we ordered take out they separated the sauce from the meat so that it wasn't soggy by the time I got home. Serving sizes are proportional to price. Good lunch menu as well. Can't go wrong. One of our new Chinese food go to places."}
{"text":"Generals tasted vinegar like ...still trying to find a back east style generals chicken"}
{"text":"Great food.   I have been there twice and the service was lacking. Tables ignored.  Consider this a takeout spot until they train someone new."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in AZ hands down!  My favorite is the Hunan 2 but everything I have had from there is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's quite possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had. The food is always made fairly quickly and is not greasy and the veggies are always crisp and fresh. Service is polite and friendly. I have been a repeat customer and don't see that changing any time soon!"}
{"text":"This is the place for authentic Chinese food ! It's rare to find a place like this in AZ ! Look no further ;) stop by and try their food !"}
{"text":"Well, as you can tell from my previous review, I am very unhappy with my service. I have been contacted by Yelp, the business owner, and now two other people saying that my review was put on the wrong business. My bank statement clearly states Green Tea Bistro as the charge name. We also live on the corner of Dobson and Southern which is in the delivery area of Green Tea Bistro which is 3 miles from our house, not Green Tea Restaurant which is 10.5 miles away from my house and they do not deliver to us. The business owner has not gotten back to us since we replied to his message.   This review is valid."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food! And quick delivery, our food came 15 mins earlier than expected"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good sized portions, delicious food, and very friendly and welcoming staff. I don't usually judge a Chinese restaurant by its decor (the hole-in-the-wall places have the best food!), but this place was decorated nicely and was very clean, so it's the best of both worlds. I will definitely be back often! I got the pork with garlic sauce and scallion chicken, both of which were totally delicious. Can't wait to try more of their menu. :)"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I have had in a long time and great service!  I will be back soon and am looking forward to trying other menu items that I am sure will be amazing!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not your run-of-the-mill strip mall Chinese place, its way better. I'm having a hard time trying different dishes because each time I try something new that's all I want to order. Their lo mein is just wonderful, their soup is mouth watering, and no matter how many times I've been here I can never seem to leave the place without getting some crab puffs, although I do believe my most favorite thing they have his their salt and pepper calamari."}
{"text":"The food has been really good. But, the woman on the phone taking my order hung up on me when I asked to cancel my order after she applied several additional charges."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Chinese.  We've had delivery and dine in and we do prefer dine in.    The Orange Chicken is great!  The Egg Drop Soup is some of the best soup I have ever had.  The Singapore Noodles are fantastic.  I love how you can tell them what spice level you want both when ordering online and at the restaurant.  I love spice where others in my household don't.    If you dine in you will find that the restaurant is super clean.  I've been in many Chinese restaurants where you cringe a little because of the cleanliness but not here, very clean.  They are a little pricier than most area Chinese restaurants but it is certainly worth the extra.  We usually go to Teriyaki Kitchen down the street but after going to Green Tea a few times we seem to pick Green Tea more often."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now. Excellent food and service. The Orange Peel Beef and Shrimp with Walnuts are my favorites."}
{"text":"However devoid of creativity... and wall decor it may be - the food (based on the one meal of Mongolian Beef I've had here so far) was actually pretty darn great.  The service was quick/attentive, and the prices were also good.  Kind of the perfect generic Americanized corner Chinese lunch/takeout place so far.   Will post an update after I've had another meal or two there."}
{"text":"We love Chinese food and are always looking for new places to try.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  We had the Sweet and Sour delight, Triple Delight, Chicken lettuce wraps, Shrimp fried rice, Lo Mein and Egg Rolls. The egg rolls were nothing special, but everything else was delicious. We did take out so I can't comment on service. Also they don't have Egg Foo Young on the menu, but I asked and they will make it for dine in customers. Definitely going back to dine in."}
{"text":"Had lettuce wraps, they were fine, but not special.... Then came pork fried rice....good but nothing out of the ordinary. But wait.....coconut chicken???  Oh yes! Special, delicious, tender and so tasty.....with the pleasant service we got, this dish makes a return visit a must do!"}
{"text":"The walnut crispy shrimp is amazing!  Beautiful delicate large shrimp in a mild slightly sweet sauce.  Egg foo young is delicious.  Lo mien is delicious.  Crab Puffs are wonderful.  Chow fun is like a Chow mien and it was amazing.  I didn't care for the Sesame chicken.  It was too sweet and too much sauce.  Everything else has always been delicious.  They deliver too.   I highly recommend this restaurant.    They are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This is the best place we have had. The chicken is always tender and the beef has never had gristle like other Chinese restraints. The flavor is wonderful. We have been here 3 different times and ordered six different things and every time they have all been fabulous."}
{"text":"I created a yelp account JUST so I could review this place. Best Chinese food I have ever eaten. The hot and sour soup and spring rolls are to die for. We also got the chicken with egg plant and the orange chicken. Both are incredible. I loved this food so much because nothing was greasy like a lot of Chinese food I have tried in the past. Can't wait to try more dishes from here!"}
{"text":"Very quiet at lunch today.  There were 4 of us dining.  Atmosphere clean, pleasant and comfortable.  Staff very accommodating, friendly, attentive. The food was just average.I had eggplant and minced pork in garlic sauce.  It is a spicy dish that I requested to be extra spicy, it wasn't! There was barely any pork in it, maybe an ounc.e or two of ground pork.  We also had General Tso's Chicken, also barely spicy but plenty of white meat chicken, not a lot of flavor.  My sister had shrimp in lobster sauce, could had been a bit thicker, shrimp cooked well.  The meal was so average I will not return."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because it had the highest rating on  Yelp in my area. We did take out, and it was so refreshing to have really tasty Chinese food for takeout.  We have had food from other Chinese restaurants that used to be good, but aren't any longer.  I ordered online and was able to leave special directions with my order, which we received on time. The website is easy to use, but it was ambiguous as to whether or not I would receive rice with each main entry, since I had seen elsewhere on the website that I would be charged for rice. However,  there was no rice selection/price on the ordering page. I had to specify my brown rice order in the special instructions box There was no extra charge for the rice we received. Also, I was unable to access the menu page using Firefox, but it did work on safari - - what gives? Still, a five-star entry for the taste and freshness of the food. I am looking forward to having leftovers for lunch tomorrow :-)"}
{"text":"I was at work last night and a worker from Green Tea Bistro called me. I answered my phone and was asked if I ordered a family sized meal. I said NO and the worker asked me what my phone number is. He called my phone. I hung up. Ten minutes later, another Green Tea bistro worker called. I did not answer because I was at work. He left a message asking for my number. Thirty minutes later, another Green Tea Bistro called and about five minutes after that, the guy called back practically begging for my number. It creeped me out."}
{"text":"Overall good, everything tasteful, waiter even allowed us to order the chicken Orange off the lunch special for our son. Only problem is that they don't extra extra spicey."}
{"text":"So far in the area, this is my favorite Asian restaurant. I mostly get chicken dishes. Tasty and filling. People at the restaurant are very friendly. I always see other Asian people eating here, which I take as a good sign."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend ate here for lunch. Let me first say the lunch special is awesome. It comes with soup and your choice of three entres for 5.99. I got the hot and sour soup and he got the egg drop. Both were delicious. We also got the crab puffs as an appetizer and we both agreed it was the best we had ever had. I could be wrong but from the flavor and texture it seemed like they used real crab meat. I had the kung pow chicken, it was really good and fresh. The veggies were still crisp and it wasn't to greesy like other places I've eaten at. Another thing I like was the selection of drinks. I had the ginger honey and he had there specialty green tea. They also have a lemon honey and a grapefruit honey that I am excited to try on future visits. We both left stuffed and happy and our total bill was only 20 dollars. I will definitely be back again and look forward to trying new things."}
{"text":"My first time to Green Tea Bistro and I love it already!  Extremely fresh and cooked to perfection. Sauces are delicate and wonderfully tasty! This is a small place but super nice and clean inside. Service was outstanding as well, very nice people!  Please give this place a try and support small business's that are doing an excellent job."}
{"text":"We've been curious about this place since it opened and decided to give them a try. The service was great as well as the food. We had hot and sour soup, string beans with chicken, and a shrimp and beef combination. Everything came our hot with very good flavor. We will definitely be back again. They also have lunch specials that I'll try soon."}
{"text":"Wrong order, called the restaurant.  Was informed that because I ordered rice the Mu shu should not have pancakes, although they could not explain why the General Tso's chicken was sweet and sour and that there was no sauce for the Mu  Shu.     What food did arrive was soggy and too gross to eat.    Huge disappoint.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I drove 6 and 1/2 miles to this place to try it, and I must say, TOTALLY worth it! I got takeout because I didn't have the time to dine-in. But this review will be for take out and the Restaurant itself. I'll definitely be back! I will give a review on the dine-in experience, which I'm predicting will be awesome!  First Impressions-  When I entered the Restaurant, I notice that's it is VERY clean, well organized, and maintained. The chairs and tables were in good shape and clean. It's a very quiet/relaxing environment with music at just the right volume. That Staff is very friendly and seems to care about Their Customers as well as Their experiences.  My Experience-  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the Friendly Gentleman at the Cashier Desk. I asked Him for a To Go Menu, which He gave me and said \"Please take your time, Sir and let me know if you have any questions\". I decided to order the 'Chef's Special: Orange Flavored Chicken' with Lo-Mane instead of Rice. He told me it will be ready in about 10-15 minutes, which He was right. He asked me if I wanted a glass of water while I wait. - It's little things like that, that make the customers coming back. Kudos to the Owner!  The Food-  The Orange Flavored Chicken was crisped to perfection, not too overcooked, just perfect. The sauce was tasty and flavorful. You can taste the the real orange flavor. There was just enough spice to give it that spicy flavor and be enjoyable at the same time. The Lo-Main was tasty, soft (not stale), and not over cooked.  I would recommend this place to anyone! The food is very good, authentic, and cooked to order. The Staff actually cares about Their Customers. This is the cleanest Chinese Restaurant I've ever been to and I will be back for more!  P.S. If You're the owner reading this; please remain the Small Business that you are, and keep doing what You and Your wonderful Staff are doing! I notice you Guy's have a Yelp Sign in You Restaurant, and You have every right to Brag!   Thanks! - Gabriel Salazar"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to this place on July 5th to get a TO GO order. When we came in, it was very clean and the guy with glasses who was at the bar met us with a smile! He was very sweet and young, also explained anything we asked him about the menu! He also offered his favorite dishes and showed us the \"real Chinese menu\" where we ordered some good food. So we got the Wor Wonton soup, beef with broccoli, chicken with pineapple, seafood with noodles. He also got us a lot of extra sauce which was very nice. So we got home to try everything out and it was just great! The food was so fresh and tasty! Totally loved it. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was so good and you get a decent portion for the price. The service was great. Hot and sour soup was the best we've had since moving to AZ. We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves such delicious food.  At times Chinese food seems very unhealthy.  This was the opposite.  Not only were our dishes yummy but they didn't taste oily or greasy.  The owning family are sweet and helpful and the decor is very attractive.  They really go out of their way to produce wonderful food here.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had here in Phoenix Arizona.  We drove 30 minutes to try this place and it surpassed my every expectation.  The staff was amazing and very attentive and the recommendations were spot on.  Each dish came out piping hot full of flavor and beyond deliciousness!!!  Not to mention that the portions were huge and on average $4-$6 dollars cheaper then PF Changs and superior quality.  The beef lo mein had amazing flavor an tender juicy beef that melted in your mouth.  The lemon chicken breast was so crispy on the outside and super moist inside. The lemon sauce was out of this world    The orange chicken and sweet-and-sour pork are also a definite must and without doubt be, your favorites well fast as well."}
{"text":"The scallion pancakes appetizer is probably my favorite dish, it is delicious! Try it!!  I have ordered from this place many times since I live nearby and their food is always tasty and the employees are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Now I have to say, it ain't good if it ain't attracting Asians, and this place was flocking with Asians. The food was really delicious. I don't really see a flaw about it, it was clean, the staff was nice and the food, well my food was ready in 15 minutes just like they said, and it was great! Fresh hot! And the Tupperware is a plus! Don't throw it away, you can reuse it in the near future. Good bang for your buck and I ordered for pick up and they packed it very securely in a brown paper bag, very presentable. Yeah I'll definitely be coming back here every time I get the chance."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after reading reviews. We are so glad we did.  We also ordered take out for our daughter. We all thought this was the best Chinese food we have eaten in the valley, and we have tried many, including the well known chains. Their food was fresh and very tasty, not too sweet, salty or  oily.  We ordered mu shu chicken, vegetable delight won ton soup and mongolian beef. They give you a white or brown rice option. The service was excellent.  This is now our favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Fast, friendly service. I had the vegetable spring rolls to start (they were crunchy and amazing) and the orange chicken lunch with wonton soup and would get it again but can't wait to try something different. Will go back again soon because I can't help it! The decor was perfectly fine (it's a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall for goodness sakes) clean, bright, and inviting. Fair prices too."}
{"text":"This is one if my favorite Chinese restaurants in Arizona! I get take out from here at least once a month and I don't even try other Chinese places anymore.  Their lo mein is awesome and that is what I usually get, but I recently tried the sweet and sour chicken and that was great too. The crab puffs are my favorite appetizer they are always delicious! The only thing I haven't liked there so far are the lettuce wraps.  There was a spice in them that I wasn't fond of, but everything else is wonderful, always quick and hot when I pick it up or have it delivered!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place often since it is on my way home. It is located in an unassuming location at the end of a strip mall. The decor is simple, but the establishment is clean. The server was helpful in answering my questions (I had asked what their more popular menu items were). I ultimately got the scallion pancakes as an appetizer, and the salt and pepper pork chops for an entree. My friend had the sizzling beef. Everything tasted freshly prepared, and was delicious. I have eaten in many independent Chinese restaurants in the area and would rank this highly based on my initial impressions. As a tip: they have two menus. One is a Chinese menu tailored towards the American palate. They also have a more traditional Chinese menu with some exotic items like bitter melon. It's hard to give a perfect 5 star score based on one impression, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife today...  First time we've tried it and we'll definitely be back for more!  The lunch specials are awesome...  A lot of food (and a bowl of soup) for a great price and the food was yummy...  My wife got the Kung pao chicken and I got the sesame chicken...both were great!  This is a definite must-try if you're looking for a new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This was a recommendation from a friend which got mixed reviews from our table. My husband was not a fan but my daughter & I really liked the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"As far as authentic Chinese food goes, this place is pretty on point.  Servers were nice and helpful. Place looked relatively clean. Only down side is that it's kind of over-priced."}
{"text":"Read other reviews, saw that green tea bistro had a lot of 5 out of 5 reviews, so decided to try it.  I wasn't disappointed, food was tasty and portions were large.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome food and service! They just had their exterior remodeled and it looks great. Best takeout in town! We  their General Tsos !"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered from here recently and the quality was good. The food was delicious but not as good as many other Chinese places that I'd go to. Overall quality was good but the green tea that they offered wasn't good. I would definitely order again but avoid the tea."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and ordered To-Go. Clean restaurant and Friendly Service.  Everything else was terrible. I ordered tofu vegetable soup and chicken fried rice.   I bring it home (after paying $15 for just soup and rice) and find no vegetables in this soup aside from a few mushrooms and a few bamboo shoots. It was watered down egg drop soup with very small, flavorless tofu pieces.  Next I opened my fried rice, which has a strange yellow color to it... not from turmeric, it was just odd to me.  I'm starving so decide to eat the food I'm disappointed in that I feel I paid way too much. I take a first bite of fried rice and get a giant piece of chicken gristle, no meat. Ugh, it got worse... no vegetables in the fried rice, just a few small pieces of green onion.  I am sad because this is the closest Asian style restaurant to my home... but I honestly will never go back.  To give you (as the reader) perspective, I consider myself a fat-kid foodie, who works in the food industry and will give kudos even to a Panda Express (which I did last week!).  This food was some of the worst Chinese I have had in a LONG TIME."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic chinese food! First time trying chinese hot pot and i totally loved it :) Definetely coming back for seafood pot. Clean tables and floor, quiet area and price is about right! Its not a cheap, grab-and-go place, but a Chinese restaurant. Very excited to find this new place!"}
{"text":"Ordered and waited in there for 30mins, people coming 20mins after us got their food. I told the around 40 years old lady we are leaving if you guys don't hurry up. Well, she replied: get out from here ??? What ? Worst resultant ever in my whole life"}
{"text":"We love Green Tea Bistro, whether we eat in or take out!  The Chinese food we ate directly from Chinatown in San Francisco was a disappointment compared with Green Tea.  We're working our way through the menu, although it's hard not to keep ordering our favorites, but everything we've tried has been outstanding in quality and quantity."}
{"text":"This is Is really good ! It tasted really fresh and homemade everything took awhile to come out but it was worth the wait. I would go back again because I think I found my new spot!"}
{"text":"The dishes taste very good. I hope I could find this restaurant earlier!!! We ordered three dishes, they were all excellent!!! But I like the eggplant chicken most, it reminds me the time when I was undergraduate student. Strongly recommend this place, we will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Incredible Mongolian Beef. Just spicy enough and has the sweet Hoisin flavor to compliment it. Nice cuts of beef and lots of onion. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices will have me coming back to try other items. Even open on Christmas Eve, making for the perfect meal after spending the morning assembling my son's new toys."}
{"text":"I called and placed an order for an Orange Chicken lunch with fried rice and a side of Lo Mein. I was told I didn't meet their $15 minimum order so I ordered 2 orders of egg rolls. I received Lo Mein, egg rolls, and a side of fried rice. I didn't order a side of fried rice. I paid over $20 for this meal and didn't even get what I wanted. These guys are horrible. Their food is nothing to brag about. Its average at best. If you cant take an order don't own a business! I would never recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Are you ready to be transported? Because that's what will happen when you order this food, transported to a euphoric state of pure deliciousness. So I ordered the dumplings and the hunan two. First things first you can order chow menu instead of rice, which was a hard decision but I went with the chow main. The staff is very friendly and there is a very cute fish tank while you wait, anyways pick up the food and get home. This stuff is amazing. The red bell peppers in here are amazing. They are fresh and lightly sautéed, as well as the broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. This is a great portion for what you are ordering and the meat is nice big slices. The sauce is this spicy brown concoction with lil Brown beans that are perfectly spicy. The chow mein is seriously amazing and also a great side size portion. These dumplings have to be some of my favorites in the valley and I have tried my fair share. This is incredibly worth it, better than most Chinese take out by far. It isn't your typical take out. Seriously give this place a try."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special of beef and broccoli with egg drop soup which was fabulous and all for only $5.99. I highly recommend the lunch specials for the right price. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Green Tea Bistro has the best beef noodle soup in the valley. They make their own green onion pancakes (delicious and not oily). The spicy fish soup is just lovely. Restaurant is clean and the staff is welcoming, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best oriental food I have ever had! We ate at the restaurant and the service was fast and friendly, the food was so flavorful, the lunch specials were a great price and we got so much food we couldn't eat it all but the leftovers were great that night! I got the lo mein and would highly recommend that as well as the spring rolls! I can't wait till I'm back in this area so I can eat here again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants I've eaten at since moving here from Montana."}
{"text":"Tried Green Tea Bistro for the first time with delivery.   The food took almost 75 minutes to arrive (was supposed to take 45-60 minutes.   The egg roll had a weird taste and the Won Ton soup had no vegetables at all (just broth and wonton).  Not impressed at all and won't be using them again."}
{"text":"I really liked it!  We wanted to try something new are so decided to give this a try.  The Orange Chicken was five start to me...really good.  The chicken lo mein looked awesome but lacked a little flavor..still pretty good..four stars.  I'll give this place a 4.5!  Give a try and support a new business in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"generous portions and delicious food, delivered piping hot"}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant,with plenty of seating.The food is real good here.We started with some egg rolls and scallion pancake's,both delicious.Chicken w eggplant/garlic sauce was fantastic,house lo mein excellent,shrimp in lobster sauce had good flavor but was very thick and starchy.Service was good but a bit disjointed.Will definitely return to try something else on the menu.The hunt continues."}
{"text":"My husband couldn't stop talking about his food. I had to order through Eat 24 because my husband has a busy schedule and so do I. I ordered the food to be delivered to his work for him in between clients. It was simple and my husband just loved the food. I'm sure he'll have me order again. We got the Meat filled steamed dumplings, fried rice and Chicken!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here twice.  Both times the food arrived very quickly and piping hot.  The egg rolls didn't even get soggy before they got to my house (but I do live pretty close).  I would say their food is above average Chinese food.  It is not my favorite that I have ever had, but definitely good.  The meat is good quality and doesn't seem old like a lot of other places (including China Wok)."}
{"text":"We tried this place after the reviews on yelp putting it as a high rating.  We have a chicken meal, a beef meal, and pork fried rice.  Everything was tasty and we would go again, but it was just good.  Nothing memorable except the green tea was really GREEN, tasted just like any other green tea so I don't know what the hype was on that from other posts.  It was a good dinner."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch. Ordered and paid online for pick up...said would be ready in 30 minutes. ..arrived 10 minutes early and it was ready. ..and hot! Yes! Food was flavorful and plentiful off the lunch menu and the price was right.  I had the Kung Poa chicken with egg drop soup and white rice.  Plus order of crab puffs.  And , it was packed in nice containers so food would not spill. Will definitely eat there again. Yummy."}
{"text":"First I will say the food is good. I've been here several times for carryout, today was my first time dining in.   The service was just horrible. Our food came out and after that we were ignored. No one came to see if we needed anything, our water glasses were empty (had to go find someone to ask for water), and our dirty dishes piled up to the point we had to move them to another table so we had room to eat.   After we paid we were getting ready to leave when the waitress finally came back, angrily pointed at the table, and said \"no tip???\". I told her we had empty water glasses for most of the meal and could not get anyone to help us, so sorry, no. She gave us a total death stare and again said \"no tip?!?!\" Well, definitely not now, no! We got up leave and she shouted after us \"you don't come back!\"   Don't worry, we won't. And I'll be sure to tell everyone I know to do the same.   It's a shame. The food was great."}
{"text":"Came there for dinner on a saturday.  The place was busy but service was crappy.  I used to go there when it was the chinese restaurant with the lady owner as a waiter. She worked alone and did a better job in service.  Anyway... I give this bistro a 4 for their food.. but for service .maybe .05 .  I am a foreigner too and  My biggest pet peeve with  chinese, indian and ethnic restaurant, they do not hire people who knows the business but they bring nephew , niece, cousins and aunts to help in the restaurant.  and then it is a mess.  This  place opened almost over a year and they have been saying oh we applied for liquor license but they still do not sell wine or beer. stop lying, tell the truth. and hire some people at least for the the weekend when it is busy.  You still charge us the same price then why do we suffer from your poor service.  Plus the dress code of the guys working there.. sweat pants, t shirt, gangster style hat..it is a joke. The way they clean plates at the tables next to where we are eating. disgusting.  Take your dirty dishes to the kitchen and clear the plates there. Show some professionalism. This is how business close doors.  Fix the service situation please.. and people will. That night you could see frustration on the diners face.. Anyway food is good, just mix it with good service.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Okay, I really give this place a 4 1/2 stars, but I'll round up to 5.    Although the name is deceptive because a bistro?  Really?  Maybe it's the new wave of younger Chinese?  The restaurant is clean and the people working there are Chinese and super friendly, polite.  That is a huge plus and caters to non-Chinese.    When we came in, they gave us the non-Chinese menu.  My daughter asked what Moo Goo Gai Pan is.  I said, something non-Chinese people order.  My friend who brought us there said they have a Chinese menu, so we asked for that.  Most of the food is Cantonese, but I did see a couple things that were more northern, Mandarin food.  I don't know if they spoke Cantonese, because I only heard people speaking in Mandarin, but their English is very good.  As for the food, it was good and it was normal portions similar to a regular Chinese, Chinese restaurant.  During our near hour there, we saw mostly Chinese people come in, and only 1 table had non-Chinese people there.    You know when you go to a Chinese restaurant and you see mainly Chinese people eating, it's more authentic and caters to the taste of the Chinese.  We are no exception.  The food was good.  We ordered 5 dishes - Curry Chicken (tasty), Salt & Pepper Pork Chops (decent, but I have had better), Singapore Mai Fun (good), Sizzling Pepper Beef (good taste and very sizzling), Eggplant with Minced Pork Garlic Sauce (I would not recommend as it had a slight sweet taste in it, which is not normal to me).  Four out of the 5 dishes we got were good.  The eggplant wasn't terrible, but it would not be a dish we would get again.  It really wasn't hot & spicy as we expected.  This was an odd taste for this dish that I've had many times at other places.  Service was good.  My only other comment is that most of the dishes did not come with serving spoons.  That was a bit odd that we had to ask for spoons and then they gave a small spoon for one of the dishes.  That is odd.  But, everything else was good.  The food came out hot.  The service was excellent.  We didn't  have to wait too long for the food.  We would come back again and I would recommend to my siblings & their families."}
{"text":"Ordered my food through Seamless Web. They said it would take approximately 1 hr and it did. The delivery guy was really nice and tried his best to find me(at a hotel). I thought the food was a little expensive but the portions are big so it makes sense. The chicken with broccoli was really good. They don't use too much sauce or that cheap thick one. I ordered a tofu vegetable soup and that was my favorite. It's like a white egg drop soup with mushrooms, bamboo, tofu and cilantro (I asked for no carrots). I also got the wonton soup and the broth was flavorful. I have no complaints about this place."}
{"text":"I like that they have an option to place an online order. I find it more convenient. I scheduled my pickup time for 1 hour and 45 out. I arrived exactly on time and my food was ready for me.  I ordered Hunan2. Which had beef and shrimp. This had a nice flavor and just the right amount of spicy.   I also ordered beef low mein. The noodles were good. The beef was lacking in flavor. I added salt and soy sauce. I should have asked if they had chili oil. I love that stuff.   Of course I had to order the green tea after reading all the yelp reviews. I guess I'm going to be one of the few who don't care for it.  This doesn't taste like any green tea I've ever had before. It has an after flavor. Like something is added to this tea.  The flavor to me, is similar to gemnema slyvestre.    Overall, it's a nice clean, friendly restaurant with descent Chinese food. It's not my favorite so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Quick take out! Good sweet and sour chicken. The pepper steak wasn't what I expected. The egg rolls were crisp and hot."}
{"text":"This place has great food and great service. I choose this location over any other Chinese food location around.   We always order from specialty menu: Egg drop soup, eggroll, Beef with broccoli, white rice, orange chicken, and kunpao chicken are great options. We never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be ordering again. Delivery was quick but the food was completely bland and tasteless. Ordered the general tso's chicken and the sauce on the chicken tasted like watered down ketchup. I ended up having to toss it after a few bites."}
{"text":"We got a simple meal of Sesame Chicken and Chicken and String Beans. Service was fast and friendly. The food was fantastic. So fresh and flavorful! Not your typical fast food Chinese. It was like a fresh home-cooked meal. Words can't explain how tasty and satisfying the food was. Better than my fav Chinese fast food place back home. This place beats it hands down.  If you want Chinese in this area, don't even hesitate."}
{"text":"Very good and very light.  Hard to describe but a lot of chinese food I have had seems overly greasy but this was very clean and delicious.  Delivered was even better.  The portion sizes are huge!  I order one meal per person (4 in the house) and I could have easily only ordered two.  However the sides were much smaller."}
{"text":"This was just OK. Had two lunch specials (Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Chicken) and spring rolls (which are deep fried). Fried rice and wonton soup. $17 or so. While the main dishes were not bad they both were bland in flavor and spice (both requested extra spicy which they weren't). The fried rice tasted like it had been fried in oil that was dirty and was a bit greasy.  The spring rolls were very good. The wonton soup is a complete failure and literally flavorless."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had for awhile. Service is nice!  I'm gonna become a regular of this place."}
{"text":"I was rather excited to order from them when I saw that it got pretty decent reviews.  I was even more excited when I saw they have Singapore Mei Fun.  I noticed that on their menu, there was no description of what type of meat you could choose from  so I wrote in the comments box to add 5 spice bean curd or Tofu(if they didn't have bean curd).  I assumed that since there was no choice of meat in either the description or when placing the order that it didn't come with meat in it.  With that assumption, I thought my comment about adding the bean curd made sense.  Well I received a call right after placing the order from the restaurant.    The gentleman on the phone was unsure what I meant by adding bean curd or tofu.  I had to explain that if they have bean curd, I prefer that.  He then asked me if I wanted $1.00 or $2.00......I had to get clarification on what he meant by that.  I had to ask multiple questions in regards to what the difference was.  All I was able to get out of him was that $1.00 would add about 6 pieces of bean curd. I told him to go ahead and add $1.00 worth of bean curd.....  An hour and 15 minutes later (keeping in mind that I ordered at 2pm, way after church was over when restaurants are the busiest) They arrived at my work which is a block away from them.  When I picked up the food from the front desk, the lady stared at me with a blank stare.  I asked where I need to sign and she advised that I need to pay the $1.08 difference.  I advised her that I was under the impression that my card was going to be charged the updated total once I added bean curd.  Nope not the case, her reply when I stated that the gentleman on the phone didn't specify that I needed to have cash on me(which I don't) to pay for the difference instead of them making it easier by charging my card that they already had from my order.  Instead, I was advised that I have to call a separate number not related to their restaurant and pay the difference.....Interesting.  The best part about all of this is that the item I ordered has beef, chicken, pork AND shrimp in it.....Oh we cannot forget about my 6 pieces of bean curd.   So all of the frustration could have been avoided if their menu had a simple description and/or option to choose a meat that I would have preferred."}
{"text":"Still good but probably 3 star. The salt and pepper chicken wings are great and the garlic shredded pork was very good. Pork fried rice however had no flavor. I asked for it without carrots and peas but with bean sprouts and scallions. It came with nothing but the pork."}
{"text":"Best chinese food I've had in Arizona!  We had orange beef and orange chicken both were cooked to perfection!  I highly recommend you stop in.   Restaurant was cute and very clean.   Staff was attentive and very kind!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Despite its \"fusion\" name, this is an authentic Cantonese restaurant. This is my parents' favorite place to come when they visit me in AZ. Like most good authentic chinese restaurants, there is an Americanized menu and a chinese menu (the yellow menu pictured).  A new favorite I was introduced to was the hand ripped cabbage which is a sweeter version of a typical white cabbage, sauteed in a hot wok with a bit of Szechuan peppercorn and hot pepper flakes.   Green Tea Bistro also made finally made me a fan of bitter melon with their bitter Melon and beef saute. The mapo tofu and cold sliced pork with garlic and chili sauce dishes are to die for!!  Another solid choice is the clay pot with chicken and mushrooms (written in chinese on the chalkboard by the front door)."}
{"text":"Good food at cheap prices. I go there for lunch during the week. I always see Chinese people eating there which is a good sign."}
{"text":"My mother in law and I checked out this place tonight and I have to say delicious food and great service they were very polite and fast except at the end but it got very busy by that time so it was understandable we will deffinitly be going back."}
{"text":"Green tea has so many good authentic Chinese food and they are so delicious! Especially I like boiling spicy food. But there are so many great ones and hard to choose which one is the best!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really really good food.  Everything was super fresh and you can tell was handcrafted unlike most other Americanized Chinese food in the area.  We had the sesame chicken, fried rice, and dumplings and everything was great.  We've ordered from their twice now and they have great attention to detail and got everything right.  We'll be repeat customers from now on."}
{"text":"The best authentic Chinese food in the town????The best authentic Chinese food in the town????The best authentic Chinese food in the town????"}
{"text":"I dream about this place and have been known to drive clear across town to get it - since I live in North Phoenix and it's in Mesa!  My daughter loves it too, mostly because they have the best egg drop soup I've ever tasted.  I haven't tried a lot of things on the menu here, but I can tell you for sure that the chicken lo mein is absolutely incredible, it has the tastiest sauce ever!  My daughter and I come here just about every week and we get the egg drop soup and split the chicken lo mein.  It's truly the highlight of my week!!  This place is impeccably clean and everyone there is super friendly. Their service is prompt and very attentive - I don't have anything negative to say. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch time specials, very clean, good size portions, very nice quick Chinese spot. I can definitely see my self coming back!"}
{"text":"I'll make short and sweet. Check it out. Good service and good food. Expect it to be busy if you go around 6p-8:30p. I've gone at different times and have ordered something different every time. So far so good. Plenty of vegan and veggie options which got my attention in the first place. If you get that look when asking a question just ask for someone that speaks English. Don't let that keep you from enjoying a great meal."}
{"text":"We've ordered here at least 4 times now. We love this place. The last order was Lemon Chicken (my husband switches between this and Orange), Mongolian Beef and Black Bean Chicken.   The Black Bean Chicken was recommended by the girl who works there. I thought it sounded strange but I took her advice. It is SO GOOD! My new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They're always at least 15 to 20 min early on delivery orders. The food is great, and they take extra effort to make sure they deliver it fresh too! The sesame chicken, egg drop soup, and the crab angels are delicious. The service is extremely friendly too! Best delivery restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"The Food here is outstanding always fresh and hot!! I have a friend from Thailand that use to cook for me, it was really hard to eat out oriental food, but thankfully we found this place and love it!! We always order on yelp and have it delivered. This service is so awesome because if i call directly they don't deliver to me but i can order and yelp and it gets delivered to me."}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience we have had for a long time. First, the service is awful. We waited for an hour before the food showed up. However, two tables coming after us got their food almost right away. When we got our food, they were ready to leave. The only thing I can think is they are Americans and we are not. The waitress took order from Chinese customers with a long face but smiled ear to ear at all American customers. Why?! And, food! The food they serve is the same as Asian Express Cafe, almost identical but price is triple. Two people $43. Worst of all, servers kept rubbing their noses with their fingers. We, for sure will never go back. How terrible it is when you are discriminated by your own people! Why don't they just put a sign on the door \"American Only\"!"}
{"text":"I must say that initial impressions based on decor were totally wrong.  The food we had was top rate, and I come from Chicago where our China town is outstanding.  The Hot and Sour soup was very flavorful, and spiced perfectly.  I had the Orange Flavored Beef and the flavor was outstanding, the meat was well prepared and unlike a lot of places the meat was tender.  Portion size was great and yet not wasteful.  My wife had a Noodle dish with Chicken and was raving to be about the flavor and quality.  This place is family run and shows the care in preparation that only a small family owned business puts into it's product ans service.    I hope that this place will flourish and when ever I am in the area I plan to return."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner and it arrived early and it was actually hot.  Everything in the order was exactly how I ordered it and it was DELICIOUS!!  I ordered the steamed chicken with assorted veggies, wonton soup and chicken wraps and it all was amazing.  I definitely recommend this place and will order here again.  New favorite!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and was encouraged by all the reviews.  I drove about 15 min out of my way to get there.  The place was pretty busy and they sat us in a corner under a plant.  I had to move the plant because it kept hitting my head and neck.  I ordered the General Chicken and my buddy ordered the Kung POW medley.  Food showed up and it turns out the medley has shrimp.  He is allergic to shrimp so he asked them to take it back.  We could not make them understand he was allergic and didn't just not like shrimp.  Older lady came out and said we would have to pay for it still so I had her bring it back and I just ate the Kung POW stuff and my buddy ate the General Chicken.  We asked for a new plate for him which never showed up.  I asked for chopsticks and soy sauce which I eventually had to just get up and get myself from the bus boy.  My buddy had to flag down a waitress for a refill on coke which also got him a dirty look.   I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tasty food cooked fresh and made to order. We tried the house egg fu young, Kung pao chicken and sweet and sour pork - all were delicious! The atmosphere was pleasant and felt really clean. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. This is our new go to place for great Chinese food."}
{"text":"Very slow to serve. They forgot two dishes for us. They only asked once if we need water and won't let us order more after 9pm."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Chinese restaurants! Try their new dish on the black board! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I Got the green tea spicy chicken \"tender chicken\" in the description. More then Half of my food was peppers... like why do you need that much in your food ever. The rest of it was super hard chicken crumbs. The only ok... thing was the lo mein and that was mediocre at best. Now my stomach hurts and my mouth is on fire from trying me to find a piece of chicken in the plate of peppers. I regret giving them a tip wish I could get my money back. Rarely do I think food is bad but this place surprised me."}
{"text":"I was visiting PHX and used Yelp to locate a good Chinese restaurant. Green Tea has mostly good reviews, they are well deserved.   We were greeted immediately and sat at a table. The lady noted the sun pouring in and immediately pulled the shade. I liked that.   We all ordered plates to share. My daughter of course wants pasta and ordered lo mein. My wife picked her stand by Chicken Kung Po. So I picked a beef dish and went with Orange Beef. All of these were good though I felt the Kung Po had too many veggies (I am a serious carnivore.   Service was great. Our waitress was a sweet lady who cared for us really well.   Prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"Ordered cashew chicken...more zucchini than chicken. The chicken that was there was cut into these extremely small pieces. Completely disappointed."}
{"text":"As an Aries, does eating lamb count as cannibalism?    The birthday festivities continued well into the weekend where I had to put my foot down and say enough is enough.  It's good to celebrate my birthday but if I eat anymore, I'm gonna have to buy new jeans, a size up.  Eeks!  So lunch at GTB was the last indulgence [minus the two giant birthday cakes I have sitting in the fridge --- lawdy!] for my birthday week.  Lunch today was delish.  I don't know what's up with the latest slew of 3 stars and below because this place is great!  It's laid back, not pretentious, and they serve up some authentic fare.  Music does not play in here so it's just you and your buddies filling in the silence which is kind of nice.  Service can be spotty since this place can go from empty to packed fast and they only have like two or three servers so be patient.  Both English and Chinese are spoken here so rest assure, your order will be placed correctly and all questions will be answered.  For the five of us, we ordered:  Toothpick Lamb, Walnut Shrimp, Beef with Bitter Melon, Hot Pot with Vegetables and Pig Intestines, Salt & Pepper Squid, and West Lake Beef Soup.  The food was great!  My favorite was probably the Toothpick Lamb --- braised lamb cubes marinated in cumin and crushed chili peppers... aw yis!  The Walnut Shrimp was pretty standard with a more than generous amount of sweetened mayonnaise on it, the Bitter Melon was definitely bitter [I like it!], the intestines in the hot pot was cleaned which is the only way to eat it [if you eat these dirty, you're dirty.  Don't talk to me.], and the Salt & Pepper Squid had good flavor.  All this and a West Lake Beef Soup cost us about $75.  GTB is a solid place if you want some authentic Chinese food without the wallet-gouging prices.  Portions are generous and the food is hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"Estimated wait time was 45 minutes on a Friday and they got here in less than 30 minutes. I had a couple crab puffs which were great. My poor friend had seconds of the orange and sesame chicken and ended up with a \"food baby\" haha. Overall they were great and the fortune cookies were definitely strange."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because of all the great reviews but I wasn't too impressed. I wish I could say more positive but really the only positive was the yummy tea and the great service. My boyfriend got the Mongolian beef and he was not very impressed. I got the chicken lo mein and it was better than his meal. I really did not enjoy it. It has this greasy burnt taste. I can't even explain it. It gave me a very weird after taste. Like I said, the service was awesome but I don't think I will be rerunning."}
{"text":"I drove 25 minutes each way to come here for a nice dinner out with the kids after reading the reviews with high hopes. Kids and I were excited, but left unimpressed. There are no kids menus which was the first small disappointment. We moved on. I ordered soups for the three of us, crab puffs, shrimp lo mein to start, then lemon chicken, moo shu pork, root beer for the kid, and hot tea for my oldest and I. The tea took around 10 minutes, then came the crab puffs (the puff crab was pretty good). The tea was a full tea pot with 1- yes one tea bag in the entire thing. More like lightly colored water). Next came the lo mein about 10 minutes after that. Then we waited. And waited.   Finally came the moo shu. Here's where the real disappointment starts. The wraps were very dry and stale and broke as soon as I tried filling them. Next came out the lemon chicken. The sauce is on the side and just tasted like honey. The chicken was about as dry as could be and took a crazy amount of pressure to cut into. Now we've been here about an hour and my youngest pipes up asking where his soup is. Kid will only eat lo mein and soup. I flagged down a waiter and asked about the soup. Apparently it was never put in. That was another 15 minutes. By this time he is hungry and grumpy. I'm tired and grumpy.   We're ready to go, but wait for this soup. Egg drop for him, and wonton for us other 2. Wonton was about as bland as could possibly get. Egg drop was fantastic. Luckily he liked mine better and I ate his. Finally something that tasted good! My oldest says the moo shu was pretty good. So now we're done and yet we sit there waiting and waiting and waiting for the check. I finally went to the counter, paid and left. I think we all agree though that between the wait, the dropped order, the lack of kids dishes, the wait (did I say that already?) and the bland/chewy/ dishes we had, we won't be back."}
