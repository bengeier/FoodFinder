{"text":"Freshly ground coffee, delicious omelette's at reasonable prices. I've been here three times for breakfast and this place is consistently delicious. Only downside is I don't want to leave. Many times I find myself finishing my breakfast but sticking around to enjoy another cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Tiny little diner.  The decor and temperature made me think it's the type of place to be frequented by the senior crowd.  Met some family here for breakfast on Saturday.  The food was pretty good - nothing extraordinarily spectacular, but no complaints either.    The relative value of the menu items seemed inconsistent.  My \"muffin toast\" came with an English muffin, a breakfast sandwich (on another English muffin) with 2 eggs and 2 peices of bacon (or sausage), and 2 potato pancakes with applesauce (or sour cream) was a great deal for $4.69.  But the Greek omelette I considered getting (3 eggs with onions, peppers, black olives, and feta) that comes with hash browns and toast was $7.25.  Not that $7.25 is a bad price, but it's just confusing.  These are just 2 examples.  There were other items that seemed to be either under or over priced compared to the rest of the menu.  The service was competent and friendly.  They did mix up one part of my order, but it was minor and I didn't even bother mentioning it.   Overall, we left satisfied.  I probably never would have gone (I discriminate against businesses without websites), but don't regret it.  Probably won't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service. Victoria is a delight with a welcoming smile.    Fresh ground coffee that I can't get enough of. Great breakfast at a great price."}
{"text":"Food is good and the price is excellent. Our service was fast, food came out hot, and the order correct. This is a great little place to go for breakfast with friends."}
{"text":"For a quick and delicious breakfast it's great, but that's where it stops. It's more geared for the \"early bird specialers\" which was proved both times I went and saw a sea of silver hair. I mean it's hard to screw up breakfast, their lunch/dinner menu is pretty much what you'd see at Denny's or IHOP with the exception of certain daily specials. It's a good quick meal idea if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Never been more disrespected in my life. If you go do not request server name Victoria or Effie they are simply the rudest people. I also found a  unidentified bug in my salad, and hair in my burger."}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews on here, I decided to give it a try. Glad I did! Very good food, reasonable on pricing and service. We called in and placed a pick up order, veggie and cheese omelet (came with hashbrowns and toast), pancakes and sausage. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Victorias is our first choice for breakfast. They've got a good size menu that has some skillets and some unique omelets as well as typical breakfast offerings. Their pricing is very reasonable and the servers are all friendly and attentive. It's a small place but I've never had to wait for more than a few minutes."}
{"text":"Honestly its a great breakfast spot but that's where it ends. The diner caters to the silver hair crowd and as such they limit their salt usage. So expect main meals to lack salt. Typical American fare."}
{"text":"Totally decent and nice breakfast place. Looks like they're open for lunch and dinner as well, but can't speak to that. Kinda looks like a converted Pizza Hut. The vibe is nice and home-y (not homie). I would call a place like this a \"greasy spoon,\" but I've always thought that was sort of an insult -- I mean, my silverware was definitely clean. Typical breakfast fare and nice-as-can-be service. Might not be my first choice, but pretty good."}
{"text":"When I walked into Victoria's I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. Through my experience, most family restaurants have out-dated decor and uncomfortable seating. Victoria 's on the other hand was quaint and homey. The service, while not prompt, was very friendly. Unfortunately though, the food was flavorless. My omelet and hashbrowns were unseasoned and my toast was like plain old Wonder bread. With so many family restaurants in the area, Victoria's is definitely one I'd skip."}
{"text":"They have really great food! I mean the most home-style breakfasts you could have! Straight out of my moms kitchen. The wait was slightly long but it was definitely worth it. Would recommend because of the great low prices too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is good. Nothing fancy. Main staples. Clean, cute, little place. Usually quiet during the week. Hoppin on the weekend. Service is always fast sometimes even friendly. I mean hey, they aren't rude. They hustle but don't always smile. They've been going strong for 35 years so they're doing something right!  They offer soup and salad bar, but I'm here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The other day was my first time here. When I first walked in, I was kind of iffy on this place. We were seated pretty quickly by one of the workers. The service was eh. I ordered a cheese omelet and that came with hashbrown potatoes and choice of toast. I was actually really surprised that the meal was really good! I would definitely recommend if you're willing to look past the grandma's basement look!"}
