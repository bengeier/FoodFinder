{"text":"My first visit to this place and my first impressions are that they are small but organized and clean. I decided to purchase some pistachios as a special treat as they looked very inviting. I bought a pre made container for a hefty price of just over 5 dollars and brought it home to consume. I didn't much care for the taste and after eating a few I felt something fuzzy in the container as it turned out to be cobwebs of some sort. A closer inspection of the contents came up with a worm wriggling around the inside of one of the nuts. Enough of that ,I took a few pics bagged the nuts and put them outside for garbage pickup this week.  To be honest I did not call to complain to the store but I have to say I will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This is by far the best persian store i have seen here. Very clean, friendly staff, beautiful design and also good products. I had mirzaghasemi there, was so good. So excited about having this store close to us."}
{"text":"Dumbest server I've ever seen in my life. I ordered the chicken kebob, I pointed to a picture.they had on the wall, she still didn't understand my order. She even asked me if I wanted the rice.  Yes, just like the picture idiot.  Having said that, the chicken was good, but no extra sauces available. Also, they seemed confused that I would be ordering persian food and not being persian, that seemed to be an issue."}
{"text":"This is a surprising little addition to an ethnic grocery store.... a kitchen and bakery in the back. The young man who manages the place was so proud and excited to show off his mother's cooking that he let us sample all the dishes there. It was so good that we took dinner home. What surprised my son and I was that the women in our family, very picky eaters, loved it too! The stars of the meal were the walnut chicken and lentils and beef. They have their own names I am sure that I cannot pronounce them. If you are in the Aurora area and want to try something new, check out this place."}
