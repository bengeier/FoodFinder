{"text":"I want to give this more stars!!   Everything I've had from this place has been absolutely delicious! The chocolate croissants are divine!   Now here is why I just can't top up their star rating: the service. I can't go in! I make my poor coworker go because I'm tired of feeling like a piece of crap after I leave. It generally takes at least 3-4 minutes of chilling at the counter waiting for someone to acknowledge that I am there and that I indeed would like to purchase something. When I finally do get to order, they don't entertain questions like \"So how's your day?\" or \"Has it been busy?\" and they are sassy and short with me! Am I not hip enough!? Am I too 'corporate'? Can they tell I don't eat mostly organic??   I am a ball of insecurity after leaving this place. One day I will be cool enough. One day."}
{"text":"Wow, best bakery I've been to in Calgary. I ate my fair share of bread and pastry in France, and this definitely stacks up. De-effin-licious, best $3.50 Danish I've ever eaten.  If you can tolerate the hipster quotient, and the smell of the organic food store, then you will be blown away by the deliciousness.  Definitely try it, try everything, I plan on it."}
{"text":"There are, at present, two Sidewalk Citizen locations in Calgary. This one is on 10th Street. It's a little bakery and deli rolled into one, and it is open Monday through Sunday (source: their web site; hopefully Yelp will update with that information soon).  They are directly connected to a small natural foods market (which has some gelato from Fiasco Gelato and some gluten-free macarons in their refrigerated aisle). It's basically one counter (ish) for baked goods and one for the deli. There's a stand upon which their bread is placed, and racks of pastries being prepped/cooled near the ovens.  Some of their offerings seem to change on a daily basis. One day, it might be blueberry Danishes and the next day, it'll be raspberry ones. Their bread selection is also on a schedule. Sourdough is pretty common, but on some days, you might see brioche or ciabatta. The bread is already laid out in paper bags and I didn't see an option of getting it sliced.  The staff member and cashier were efficient and pleasant. In fact, I ended up receiving a free Danish. :)  As for the pastries themselves, I found them to be less flaky and slightly more expensive than the ones from Manuel Latruwe Belgian Patisserie & Bread Shop. I like that they put fresh fruit on their Danishes; however, there wasn't that much fruit compote on the ones I got. Overall, it's a good quality bakery for the residents nearby, but I don't think it's the absolute best in Calgary."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The brownies are great, the danishes are so perfectly cooked.  Deli items like sandwiches and salads are all very tasty.  Only downfall is that the service is lacking.  I feel as though I'm just another customer in a place that seemingly has a community vibe.  I've been looked over in favour of people that are obviously friends of those that work there numerous times.  It's irritating to say the least.  As though my time and money are not as valuable.  I hope this place turns around."}
{"text":"Love love love this bakery!  Friendly and knowledgable staff and amazing bread!  They also participate in leftovers YYC so I never hesitate to support this local business!"}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place.  Every time I go I have their shakshuka - so good! My office also orders catering from there regularly for meetings and we have received feedback from employees that it's the best office catering they have ever had.  The service is incredible and everything that I have tasted I have loved so far."}
{"text":"Situated on a renovated building in the east side of Calgary, this bakery is a wonderful little place. The decor is absolutely beautiful- a modern, industrial style that is lovely in its simplicity. I especially appreciate the fact that they have a small dining area for people to sit, eat, and converse.   As for the food, their pastries and bread are fresh, delicious, and vibrant. There is true love and quality that is out behind their baking- and it really shows!   I love coming here from time-to-time to enjoy the food, however, I am only giving it four stars because of their pricing. $10 for yogurt and granola? I don't think that's acceptable.   If you do end up coming here, treat yourself lightly because their prices are quite steep!"}
{"text":"A gem. Not just a bakery either. They pretty much have a full menu at their east village location, and everything I've tried is to die for. You can taste the quality and passion in everything. Met the owner at east village last time I was there, very professional and you can tell he loves his business. Eat local! Eat here!"}
{"text":"Amazing to have this kind of artisan bakery in our city. Pick up their wares at Phil & Sebastian and many other places or visit the bakery on a Saturday and hang out with the bakers."}
{"text":"I love the idea of delivering bread on bike, but for someone who doesn't live downtown (yet) and doesn't work downtown, it was inconvenient for me to get my hands on these gourmet baked goods until the cargo bike store opened up on Stephen Ave. I made a trip this morning to get scones for my office meeting. Peach and Chocolate, and some sort of savory feta scone. So, how were they? I'll tell you as succinctly as I can:  THE BEST SCONES EVER.  Cute bakery boy too. He was kind of a skinny hipster meets Fabio."}
{"text":"After reading many positive reviews, my wife and I went to Citizens for brunch last Sunday and decided to stay despite a very long line up.    After waiting 15min, we ordered fried egg sandwiches but were told breakfast was no longer available (1145am) as they were switching to the lunch menu (12noon); we then tried to order Tuna melt but were told it would take at least 20min to accommodate  this complicated & onerous menu switch.    However, we could purchase prepared sandwiches and salad--which we reluctantly decided to do.   We wanted to coffees with our sandwiches but were told we had to go line up again at Phil and Sebastian at front of restaurant to purchase our coffees.     Totally frustrated, we left.   Apparently a non-culinary Luddite like me fails to appreciate the grueling, logistical differences between putting an egg on toasted bread vs. melting tuna on untoasted bread-- which has so far eluded lesser mortals like my dim witted neighbor or folks who have repeatedly failed to carry this out at Macdonalds.  This is 1st review I have ever written about any restaurant.   I pray to White Jezus (the Real One from Utah) for Calgary entrepreneurs to open more restaurants (preferably in East Village) and through competition--pressure poorly managed restaurants to develop some common sense."}
{"text":"Recently Sidewalk Citzen Bakery relocated back to Kensington (where they started) and into the renovated Sunnyside Natural Market, and started serving up delicious delicious treats.  Gourmet pizza? Scones with insanely good and unique flavour combinations that you'll dream about? They've got those, plus breads and luscious looking desserts. It's worth mentioning that they've branched out a fair bit - becoming a bit of a deli - there's a lot of salads and lunch sandwiches, and not quiet as many bread products as I'd ideally like.   My only complaints? The prices are really high, and Aviv (the owner) tweets too many damn photos of the products. SCB is making it very hard to stay on a budget and a diet!"}
{"text":"The baked goods are so good I have to limit myself with how often I go in for a browse. Their stuff is a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"Okay, pardon my rage-filled rant, but just because it says organic and local doesn't mean it automatically qualifies for a 100% premium.  I agree with everybody's assessment of the quality of the food (it is very high), that isn't in question.  But I'm getting worn out by the ever-escalating organic premium.  This would be a 5-star review if the owners reduced the prices by 25%.  $6 for a loaf of bread (of which an equally good replacement would be found at Sunterra for $4 - or maybe I'm not fully versed in the \"art of bread\")?  $4.50 for a slice of french toast?  $8 for a pre-assembled pork shoulder sandwich where the pork shoulder makes an appearance on alternating bites?  I don't understand this pretentious yuppy hipster I-love-being-overcharged-because-it's-indicative-of-my-quality-as-a-human-being approach to food consumption.  And of course retailers are more than eager to exploit this."}
{"text":"Great bakery. Very busy on the weekend but worth the wait. They always have something interesting and delish available.   Only con is that they do not cut the bread you can buy there."}
{"text":"If you would like to sit down to eat on a Saturday or Sunday, and also enjoy a coffee with your meal,  without waiting in 2 LONG lines, don't go here. Don't get me wrong, the food is yummy but that's not enough to bring me back anytime soon.   Let me explain:   My fiance and I went to Sidewalk Citizen after being referred by a friend. She raved about how delicious it was so we decided we had to try it.    We went for brunch, however, because the line was so long, by the time it came to giving our order, brunch had past and I had to decide all over again, letting many people ahead of me... I couldn't consult my fiance about what to to order for him because he was waiting in the  long Phil & Sebastian line on the other end of the building. I ended up ordering some cookies , stew, and sandwiches which came to a whopping $60! Add the lattes and that was one expensive lunch!   Thankfully we found somewhere to sit...  After we ordered I was handed a number and realized after a while of sitting at our table that we should have received the cookies by now. I wondered if they were just sitting on a counter somewhere... I was right.. grrr.   Our food came.. we ate... And had leftovers. We asked a staff member serving if we could get it boxed up to go, her reply: \"uhhh, ya, I guesss... Do you want me to, like, bring you a box? Or like, do it for you?\" - Brutal.   So, in a nutshell, if you want to pick up food to go, this place is fine.  But if you plan to stay, or haven't yet had your morning coffee, I'd steer clear."}
{"text":"Five stars without question.  Fantastic, breads with incredibly developed flavors. Some of the best scones in the city in inventive flavor combinations. A passionate baker (Aviv) and staff. Besides the incredible products, this is a place that considers a triple bottom line (economic, social, environmental). An incredible reminder of what can happen when people actually care and try to make the best possible products they can."}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing we couldn't fault it . Very friendly service and great food . We had great coffee and great pastries."}
{"text":"When I moved from France to Canada I thought I'd never be able to find real bread. Sidewalk citizen proved me wrong, their sourdough and baguette is outstanding. All of their pastries and savouries are killer too. My favorite treat has to be the boreka with red and green Harissa!"}
{"text":"Aviv of Sidewalk Citizen Bakery has been delivering bread to downtown Calgary customers for years.  Recently he opened a bakery locations for those of us that aren't lucky enough to live or work downtown.  The bakery is open Fridays and Saturdays from 10am until 3 but go early for the best selection.  The bread is often gone by 1.  Check out his website for the list of baked goods available at the store. Last time I was there it included bread, scones (savoury & sweet), croissants and danishes."}
{"text":"Went to Sidewalk Citizen for an early brunch during a work trip in Calgary on a Friday morning before heading to the airport. Service was friendly and fast, food was delicious and my Phil and Sebastian, well it's convinced me to move to Calgary. Food is a bit on the expensive side, but it is apparent that the food is made with high quality ingredients. Will definitely be back when in Calgary."}
{"text":"Travelled from Edmonton to Calgary just for this. Trip was totally worth it! Will certainly come back for more"}
{"text":"Tuna melt and a soft drink for $18? Really sidewalk? Guys at least add good toppings so that I don't feel so ripped off. I was starving so I had no choice to pay but it's annoying to get ripped off like that. I was still unsatisfied with the tuna melt and not impressed. Wish I made better life choices..."}
{"text":"This little health food bakery and store is right up there with the best. I've found some things here that are not available at the competition: 1. Zebroff's jams and jellies from the Similkameen Valley near Kereomeos, BC. 2. excellent tasty and well-textured red fife sourdough breads. This store has a homey little bakery that offers great sourdough croissants, specialty baking, and delicious slices of wholesome pizza. If you need some items from their well-organized grocery, troll the aisles and see if they have it?  The staff are among the most accommodating and knowledgable in the city. If ambiance is important to you, easily available.  What keeps me back from a 5-star rating is that the breads could be more varied. I am referring to some of the bread available in YaleTown and elsewhere in Vancouver where they carry more variety in true gourmet breads and buns. Sidewalk could be doing more to introduce them to a market that is ripe for it. After all, their main bakery is situated in the burgeoning high-end East Village district, and we don't want a chain like Cobb's coming in and trying to represent better, do we? As well, what a great thing to tie into the many families who stroll by on the riverside walkways and often drop in for a latte at Phil & Seb's.  But returning here and to their larger bakery in the Simmons Building on the east side of the downtown core has become a routine for over 3 years.  Old-fashioned funky is a word to help the hip."}
{"text":"This is MY FAVOURITE PLACE to eat in the city. Seriously.  Their sandwiches and salads are top notch, their baked goods are divine. You will likely never have a better sandwich, I've been to revered sandwich places all over the world and they don't quite meet the amazing-ness of these sandwiches. My favourites are the ones with duck breast , portabello mushrooms, or ham hocks. The ones with roast beef can sometimes be a bit lacklustre but the bread, sauces and cheeses are always good.   Whether it be the local, in season, and excellent ingredients in the sandwiches and salads, the flavourful sauces (the red harissa is my fave) or the bacon jam, I keep coming back for more.  The grain salads are always a good bet, and their soups are unique and filling. Deffo go for the savoury danishes they have--generally sticky, salty, cheesy and bacon filled, they hit the spot. Their plain sourdough croissants are solid too. They also always have a bunch of different testers you can try too, which is always a bonus! I sometimes wish their pizza was a bit more saucy but that is my own preference.  Their bread also makes great toast and paninis, even excellent breadcrumbs when it gets stale.   Their prices for salads and sandwiches can be a bit steep (I usually mix two salads to get about 200 grams for around $6-7, and one sandwich can be around $9), but you can't get anything like it anywhere else. Would I rather pay $9 for this than $5 for a subway sandwich? Absolutely.   The only downside is if it is busy their service can be a bit slow. Also, this is just a service counter where you buy your sandwiches and go. There are a couple of stools at the window but nothing really legit."}
{"text":"I'm back in the states and missing the veggie sandwich from here. Seriously. It's a smaller location than the one in the Simmons building and it's located in a grocery store, but their veggie sandwich is just so satisfying. The bread is so good and the filling is full of veggies. So much love for this place!"}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from one of the staff at the Farm cheese shop. The staff were friendly and patient while we chose from the wide variety of scrumptious looking baked goods. Everything in the showcase looked amazing! We took our treats to go, but we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Sidewalk Citizen Bakery for quite some time now so we dropped by on a Saturday morning. Thought both locations were the same but that's not the case. This SCB is located inside the Sunnyside Natural Food Market.  There's a small seating area (7 or 8 bar stools) but it's mainly a take and go spot. There's a couple shelves of pastries, salads and bread. There was also a very small hot food menu: one sandwich and one pizza. Unfortunately, they only start serving it at 11:30am. Saw them kneading the dough, looked so fresh.   - Brioche sticky bun ($3.95) - Pain au chocolat ($3.95) - Lemon tart ($4.75) - Savoury danish ($4.95)  Everything was fresh and tasty. You can tell it's made from quality ingredients. Pretty good but I need to try the other location for the full experience."}
{"text":"Chinook Mall brought out us to this area on a Saturday and since we were here I knew we had to seek out this little bakery for a snack.  We stopped in right after lunch and some of the supply was getting low.  BUT we managed to get us some ciabatta bread, sticky buns and ham/cheese croissants.  OMG YUM.  Yup it was all amazing.    We fought over the sticky buns, the croissants were buttery/flaky/fabulous and the ciabatta...well 3 of us sat around the island eating it later that day completely in heaven.    We didn't eat it all and a couple days later I found what was left and quickly made it into croutons.  (waste nothing)  They have a small but delicious variety of items to choose from in the bakery and I look forward to dropping by again soon to partake in more yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Sidewalk Citizen satisfies every cell of my carb loving body. I don't know how they do it but both their savory and sweet scones are some of the best I've tried.  Always with a crisp golden crust of whatever the filling is of the day, these scones hold the perfect ratio of moist crumbliness. Although I'm not generally a sweets person, their danishes are also fantastic with a buttery, flaky edge and just enough custard on the inside.   Unfortunately, the only thing I didn't love were the menu items with meat such as the meatball sandwich and the lamb pizza. Don't get me wrong, the crust and the sandwich bread would make me order both items again, but I found the meat to be on the drier side. Not a deal breaker, but being someone who travels routinely with access to renowned bakeries and cafes, this was a little disappointing for me. All in all though, I would absolutely be back and glad to see Calgary inching up its culinary game."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I always hit up for a quick lunch as its close to work. Parking is super hard to find near the area though. If I'm lucky I can usually score a spot on the street. Prices here are high. But the quality I feel like it's almost worth it. As this is location in connected to the Sunnyside Natural Market, I always take a stroll into the market side... I stare at their frozen treats section while I wait for my sandwiches to heat up. Always so tempting!  I ever know what to expect when I come here. But if I have a veggie sandwich in mind I tend to come here. I love their pizza here as well, I'm not usually a crust eater but their pizza is to die for even if it's their vegetable pizza.   I'm not in love with their soups, they always seem to have funky flavours like the sesame miso based one I got the other day... my taste buds weren't too fond of it, but I was happy to have the big slice of bread that accompanied it though.  With each visit, I always get a few cold salads to go. I could eat them everyday; if not for the cost of them. The premium vegetable salad rings up to 27.5/kg. so getting even a little bit seems to cost me a fortune. Gotta pay the cost to eat healthy outside of the home I guess. There are times when my kale salads appear to be drenched in oil. But I think that's how it's supposed to be...  Love their pastries here. Whether I'm looking for something sweet or savoury. A visit here always hits the spot.   For today's wonderful adventure I got a pear and white chocolate scone with rosemary. So decadent. I don't think I would find those flavours any where else in this area. The scones here are so yummy. The middle is spongy and the outside has crusted sugar. I ate it by itself as an afternoon snack and I didn't choke to death (usually scones are really dry to me...). I now have a car that smells of rosemary and sweet sugar."}
{"text":"I loooove carbs. I probably am on an all carb diet. Vegetables are technically carbs so don't judge me too harshly. Why do carbs have such a bad rep? Those carbohydrate hating people need to come to Sidewalk Citizen and try their sourdough. It is so amazing I'm sure I could eat an entire loaf by myself.   I had the vegetarian sandwich they were offering that day and they will warm it up for you if you want. The sandwich was pretty good but not mind blowing. The sandwich is a little expensive at $11 but it was quite large. Their sourdough loaves are definitely the highlight of this little shop. There is also a selection of other food in the rest of the store but I pretty much just hone in on the bread.  You get a small 5% discount if you have a friends of CJSW card. It's not much, but it adds up if you plan on coming here as often as I do!"}
{"text":"My friend said that I had to go to Sidewalk Citizen Bakery for their delicious pastries and she was right! She sent me the link to their other location, but I visited this one to check out the Simmons Mattress Building that the bakery is located in. The staff said the bread pudding is a staff favorite so I got that and asked if they could heat it up, and she said yes. I also got an almond croissant, and she asked if I'd like that heated up too so I said yes. Both were delicious and heated up perfectly! Their salads looked good too but we were in our way to have lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Chocolate Bread and Banana Nut Bread Samples Almond Croissant Sticky Bun Oatmeal and Mixed Fruit Cookie Lychee, Rosewater, Blueberry and Pomegranate Cream Danish  Located in Kensington, essentially a counter inside the Sunnyside Natural Food Market that opens at 9:00am, it was just as ownership was unlocking doors that myself and three others walked in to a space lined with ingredients and products from some of Alberta's most prominent artisans, the earthy smell of Organic Produce competing with Yeast and Sugar emanating from Aviv Fried's Sidewalk Citizen Bakery to its right.  An interesting story of a self-taught Israeli immigrant and his passion for a craft that spawned something far bigger, the Sidewalk Citizen concept launched in 2010 as a bike-delivery service for hand-crafted Loaves with proceeds donated to charity before traveling as far as Nepal for the sake of enlightenment, the baker's return to Calgary followed by the opening of an East Village brick and mortar and subsequent Sunnyside offerings.  Staffed by three people at this early hour, phone orders coming in as local business people arrived to pick up pre -orders, it was after a period of standing back to peruse that a four-item order was selected, samples of Banana Nut and Chocolate Quick Breads foreshadowing good things as both were rich and natural without overwhelming the natural flavors with sweeter tones.  Taking a bag plus one box to a nearby seating area where a small child and her mother practiced ABCs it was no surprise that both a fresh-from-the pan Sticky Bun as well as the Almond Croissant were still warm, the former a springy Brioche masterpiece loaded with Cinnamon and Brown Sugar while the later unfortunately failed miserably with a center filled to bursting with cloying, gooey Frangipane.  Immediately throwing away 80% of the Croissant, the description of 'compost' on a small can not seeming applicable to something so exaggeratedly sweet, better bites were sought and found amidst the flexible Oatmeal Cookie dotted in dried Fruit while the Lychee Danish spoke well of Aviv's lamination skills with crisp layers rich in Butter surrounding a smooth filling that was fragrant but not overpowering in its floral notes."}
{"text":"Amazing. Excellent baked goods. Run don walk to this place. One of the best breakfast pastries I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick bite to eat! The downtown location in the Simmons building definitely is bigger and has more options on their menu, while the one in Kensington doesn't have as much for hot food, but their bakery selection is almost the same as the one downtown.    If you like sourdough, go here. Period. I dare to say that I (GASP) am not really a fan of sourdough, but I've had it here being used as a sandwich and omg yum. In the Kensington location, they have a sandwich of the day, 1 vegetarian and 1 meat option, same goes with pizza. It can be sometimes a hit or miss, depending on what you're looking for that day. I haven't come here often to know whether their cold salads go out in rotation, but I have a feeling they do. The duck noodle one is superb though.   The Simmons building has more options and the backdrop for the this location is super rustic-industrial type setting. If you've been to the Simmons you'll know what I'm talking about. They have many more sandwiches to offer as well as a stew and soup of the day. Their baked goods section is also slightly bigger filled with both sweet and savoury desserts. With almost every meal that you order, you get a slice of their famous sourdough bread. And, with a little bit of butter, it really goes with almost everything you order (I even got one offered to me when I ordered a sandwich). I had their albacore tuna sandwich with a side soup (carrot & butternut squash) and it was a definitely a big lunch that got save some of it for part 2 at a later time.   Above all, TRY THEIR CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS! One of the best in the city, in my opinion."}
