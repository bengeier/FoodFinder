{"text":"Best scallops I've ever had. Just amazing. Prompt service. Delicious Moscow Mule. Steak cooked perfectly. We will be back. We eat out all the time. This place is solid. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"We went for dinner a couple of weeks ago.  The atmosphere was very nice and the hostess at the door downstairs, the one upstairs and our server were all top notch.  I got chicken and dumplings (the dumplings are ricotta gnocchi) which was delicious.  We got a cheese board appetizer, which was very good also.  Was saddened when we stopped to eat there tonight and were told it was closed for a party.  We decided to try Revel downstairs and the female bartender that was supposed to be our server was surly and nasty.  We don't know what her problem was.  She was blowing kisses to male customers that were leaving the bar, smiling and laughing and then was downright aggressively hateful to us.  My husband, who is normally oblivious to how people are acting, was so shocked that anyone would come to a table a treat customers like that that we actually just got up, left our drinks, paid our tab and left.  Someone was standing by the bar, who had seated us (a manager?) and didn't say much of anything except \"well come back and dine with us again\" REALLY??  What, was she afraid of the nasty bartender?  There is NO WAY this bartender did not know she was being rude and nasty,  she was playing innocent/naive like she didn't know what happened! hahahaha, yeah right.  If you are that miserable or have that kind of attitude, just stay home, don't ruin someone's night out."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lackluster breakfast this morning. This was my third visit in 2 months and each time service and food have not been as good as the last. I would recommend the eggs Benedict, but both the omelet and scrabbled egg dishes that I have ordered came out dry and over cooked.  The service itself is meh, and from where I was seated, I had the opportunity to watch numerous people wait in a near empty restaurant for someone to seat them & take their order.  I would like to see how they approach dinner service, but if it is anything like their breakfast, I would stay away."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was terrible and they weren't even busy. I guess Roost is part of the hotel restaurant, so there was a buffet option available for breakfast, which isn't advertised anywhere online. The food was okay but nothing special. Most of us chose buffet and a few just ordered a la cart. Like I said, our meals were okay, but it was nothing special... and the service was unfortunately just lacking. The two out of eight of us ordered a la cart and the food came out really slow."}
{"text":"I ordered the corned beef hash for breakfast on a weekday from Roost. I was confused about the cubes of meat that did not look or taste like corned beef. The hash was under-cooked and the egg was over-cooked.  I ordered grits as the side - they were completely flavorless aside from the slight taste of burnt grits.  The toast was just warm bread with no butter on it nor any provided on the side."}
{"text":"The brunch was great. Took a little long for the dirty plates to be cleaned up from the table. Our waiter seemed a little over extended. Coffee, tea, pop should be included in the brunch price in my opinion. Food was good. I liked the selection and the omelet station and the chefs there were wonderful. Great ambiance."}
