{"text":"There's nothing bad to say about FruiteaO. The staff is super friendly, they have tons and tons of flavours, the fruits are fresh, they have free WiFi and cozy seating. They even recently added a bunch of board games. If you're in the area you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I've been to many tea shops and this one would be on my top list! It's relatively new, clean and quiet with comfy seating, and great for groups. They have a few board games and cards to play with as well as cute decorations on the walls. The servers are very friendly and honest. They were having a BOGO promotion and I went in a group of 5. We stayed there for couples hours playing games then as we asked for the bill, the owner, I believe, told us that we can get one more drink for free :) Quality wise, their tapioca are freshly made and chewy, with a variety of drink options. Drinks have fresh fruits and no ice chunks for smoothies. They do serve food and other desserts but I haven't tried it yet. I'm definitely coming back! Ps, they have free wifi :)"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and I still love it :). The couches is so comfortable and the environment is really cozy. It is also really warm, which is awesome since winter is coming and a lot of bubble tea places are really with with their heating. 

Its a great place to study because they have free wifi and outlets everywhere available. It is nice and quiet during the day time and there is also a good selection of board games. 

Parking isn't available specifically for the store but you can park at food basics or the Tim Horton's plaza near by. I'm just so sad they took away the darts machine!!!! They didn't really have space for it anyways but having the option was always nice."}
