{"text":"This is the best barbecue I have had in Las Vegas. The meat falls off the bone. The sauces are all homemade. It's located inside Cactus Jack's on Maryland Parkway. Highly recommend Yugo"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time on 9/7.  The place is really small, but the food more than makes up for it.  I had the brisket, pork ribs, & Mac & cheese.  Everything was good & the ribs were out of this world!  Mike the co-owner who I met while there was very friendly & made sure all the customers were satisfied.  He showed that he cares about his business.  Have to go back & try the other awesome items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Finally found the best BBQ in Las Vegas.  Award winning sauce and excellent service.  I will be back OFTEN!"}
{"text":"Being from Houston, TX it's been hard to find a quality BBQ spot here in Vegas but this is the one! Glad I stopped in, has an authentic  mom and pop feel (always my favorite places to eat). Food  is great and fairly priced. With or without sauce, the meats are still moist and flavorful. Loaded fries are ridiculous !! Pretty much any type of meat you want served on waffle fries; a must try. Will be back often!!"}
{"text":"First Time Ordering. The pulled pork sandwich was above average in taste (nice and juicy). The bun was fresh. The reason this gets a 4 star rating is, although the waffle fries were delicious, the portion was extremely skimpy. They gave me, literally, 5 waffle fries approx 2 inches in diameter.  I wouldn't even mention this if they put them on the plate gratuitously But, they charged me $2.50 . That works out to 50 cents for each tiny piece of potato. COME ON that is not reasonable.  If you order fries, ask for a generous portion for $2.50. They sent the order out on Uber. It arrived promptly within the announced time frame."}
{"text":"I eat BBQ everywhere I travel, and I must say this is some of the best I have had anywhere outside of the Southern states.  I had the two meat combo of Pulled Pork & Brisket, both were absolutely delicious, and talk about tender, it would be hard to beat!  If you are in Vegas, and craving great BBQ, find this little joint, it is right across the freeway from the airport one block north of Russell RD on S Valley View BLVD."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this during a Vegas visit.  Lived in Nashville and this by far was the best Brisket!"}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's never lets me down. Hands down the best bbq I've had in Vegas. James and his whole crew is amazing and is always looking to go above and beyond for his foodies!! This is my go to bbq spot. This place won't let you down, that's for sure!! A must try!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that this BBQ location was under new ownership until I saw the reviews here on Yelp...so I had to try it....I LOVE BBQ.   The only obstacle is overcoming the horrific BBQ that was served by the pervious owner.  Keep up the good work and we will come.    First impression - Very Impressed and the service and greeting at the counter was a great start to the overall experience.   I had the simple  pork platter and the meat was so tender I didn't even need a knife.  Great smoke ring and the seasoning was spot on.  The Smoked Pork Belly Baked Beans..oh my were they delish.  I also had the Jessie's Mac n Cheese and it was good but a bit on the bland side...might I suggest a bread crumble with butter and garlic as a topping for this creamy delicious gooiness.   And to top it off as I walked out the door, a huge thank you was shouted at me...you don't see that often these days.   I will be back and I strongly suggest you give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love this place I go at least twice a month great sliced brisket I buy it by the pound both locations are great their st Louis style ribs are delicious as well."}
{"text":"I could sit here and explain to you the blissful oblivion Jessie Rae's has turned my lunch breaks into. But it's not something words should be used for - you just have to experience it.   First time, get you a Belt Buckle with the God Sauce(their sig. sauce). Second time, snag you a Jessie Mac sandwich and rain on it with the Pig Sweat(sauce). Third time, bring your loved one, your family, your boss, your pet, your ancestors, guardian angels, or whoever you roll with, and share a dine-in platter with them they'll never forget (drip it all over with the sauce).   Las Vegas, you're welcome."}
{"text":"This place is exactly why I love Yelp. I never would've known about it without all the reviews. It was well worth the trip, only 10 minutes from the airport. Brisket was really tender, ribs spot on and yes the Fallen Angel sauce was spicy and great."}
{"text":"What a delight barbecue restaurant!! We found it on Yelp and we're very pleased. The food is excellent and they deliver anywhere in the city. The BBQ master is very creative. He changes his smoking woods weekly. My favorite sauce was the God Sauce. Yummy find."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! I havent been to the actual business as I have only ordered via ubereats but this is my cheat meal go to! And its supporting a family run business on top of it, sincerely great business and the one issue that popped up was met with a phone call and great service to get it sorted. Food is always consistantly great as well."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine knows that I do a lot of catering for my office.  He told me about this restaurant and mentioned we should give it a shot to see how we would like it.  Working with Mike was a complete breeze.  He and his team are professional and the food was (from my attorney's)  EXCELLENT!  I was told by one of my partners to definitely put them into our catering rotation as he would love to have them again.  Go try them out!   It's amazing!"}
{"text":"God's Sauce is good because even my 5 year old loves it!   The only thing is I have to call to make sure their still open if I want to order and do pick up. Since it's just a small 4 table place, they sometimes close early"}
{"text":"Ate today at cactus jacks location for Jessie Rae's BBQ. The food is absolutely amazing. I eat bqq all the time and this is definitely completion BBQ. James the owner was very personal with my friends and I and showed us great hospitality. He really made the experience. I'd recommend this BBQ to any one who loves good q.."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding meal here yesterday! The food is so full of flavor and delicious. Every Saturday and Sunday they are doing outdoor bbq events, I highly recommend stopping by to eat and talk with the owner! He is so talented and super passionate, so be sure to say hello. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing! For being open less than 5 months they for sure know what they're doing! The owner was so nice and all the bbq sauces were so good even the hottest one was the perfect level of spicy and sweet! I will for sure be returning! You get a lot of food for the price! I recommend the chicken over waffle fries! I got the small and it was huge (bigger than what the photo shows) 10/10 recommend to a friend or fellow yelper!"}
{"text":"Came in for their grand opening for my labor day barbeque, I rarely yelp but I was definitely blown away. The God sauce is amazing. I tried my friends brisket and I don't usually like it but it was great too. I had the rib and pork shoulder combo and had to take a good portion home. I'm excited to eat it later. Great job guys"}
{"text":"Always a great time. I love how the owners always seem to be there actually serving. They obviously care a lot. Would recommend especially good for out-of-towners to see what Vegas BBQ is like"}
{"text":"Don't let the industrial area fool you, Jessie Rae's BBQ is da bomb! If you try the Maniac fries- it's a meal in itself (small one easily feeds two...my sister and I split) waffle fries on the bottom stacked with delish Mac n Cheese, incredible pulled brisket, sausage link slices with 2 home made BBQ sauces drizzled on top. As if THAT wasn't enough, we scored the Yelp $16 prefix meat combo plate.  Another split option- chopped BBQ chicken, whole sausage link, 2 fall off the bone pork ribs and a hefty side of Mac n cheese.  Small joint (5 tables) some outside picnic tables with super friendly staff and patrons. Can't wait to go back! Worth your effort!!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite and they never disappoint. Every time I've come in the food is fantastic, nyzah is fantastic and i just love the atmosphere. I will always recommend this place to others!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both had the Jessie Rae sandwich. Absolutely delicious! The BBQ was tender and full of flavor and the sauce was perfect-great flavor and a little spicy. Side of corn-good, mac n cheese-great! Delivery was quick also. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it.  Wings and ribs were delicious.  Great service from Eric.  Definetly going back."}
{"text":"The food was immaculate... great sauce great service. Will recommend it to all my friends and family..  you will love it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ, done just right. Sauce is really good not to mention deserts. Owner is really friendly. Come early before the run out of the good stuff"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've found in Vegas. I got the ribs and they were outstanding. So good I ordered a more to take home. The service was awesome. James took great care of me. This will become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Everything is good. I always go for the Jessie Rae sandwich. I didn't give 5 stars because home girl with the nose ring has a bad attitude... so bad I almost walked out. I am very friendly... friendly with her and she was rude on the phone and in person. Was making a order for pick up.. asked her questions and she was very vague and impolite. So.... I decided to go inside to make sure my order was right. She was really rude, which is a shame because the owner is a really cool guy. All I'm saying, home girl can smile. If she doesn't like her job, she has the freedom to go somewhere else... good food can only go so far until staff make it a completely unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Seriously the best BBQ ever!! The service and food are by far the best. The sauce  GAME CHANGER. You don't know BBQ until you come here."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I was in BBQ capital Kansas City. I went to a restaurant that had been declared the best BBQ place in the country. Wrong! Jessie Ray's is better! You can't go wrong here. Even the waffle fries, which I never expect much from, were, my exact words as I ate them, \"Divine...\" I'm from Idaho so I know potatoes. I'd give them more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Service is terrible this should be separate from the whole bar some people would not like to smell like an ashtray before eating. Food was the worst, bells bbq up the street is 1000% better. $30 can be spent somewhere way better and you won't be sick after...  Update: after the comment I have received from the owner, worker whatever he maybe I must say it makes me feel even worse I went there. How does an employee of a business not use proper grammar on replying to a review and second I did take my food home which yes was terrible in my families opinion. People have different taste. Some people would not like gummy chicken for dinner and Mac and cheese that taste like toilet cleaner. So if you feel like your 1000 of reviews and \"awards\" will keep you going from working out of a bar then cheers to you. However the continued poor customer service I have seen from this place a bar might be the best place for you to serve you so called award winning bbq. Also, fabricated please, it was terrible still trying to figure out these 5 star ratings. And yes Bells BBQ, Rollin smokes, even Dickey's will keep my service, because their meat is not pre-chewed and more then 5 side selections with customer service that exceeds your bartender as a waiter. So spare me that I just had a \"bad batch\" of your prized BBQ."}
{"text":"I love waffle fries, and this place has the best ones yet. Top it off with some pulled pork and some bomb fallen angel sauce. Best $12 ever spent"}
{"text":"Just had Jessie Raes for the first time.  Had the Duke fries.  Waffle fries topped with pork and sauce.   Amazing   We also had the 3 meat combo.  Brisket. Pork  and chicken.     Brisket is the best in town.  Pork best in town  Chicken amazing. Probably my least favorite of the 3.   All the sides we had were great.   The smoked butter was great.    5 star all the way."}
{"text":"The Duke is amazing.  I dream about it.   Pulled pork on top of waffle fries with sauce and some other dressing.  Small place in strip mall.  Not many tables so be prepared to possibly wait a little during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"No words to explain how awesome this place is ! Ribs is a must have & the Mac and cheese !!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I was visiting town, and after several people recommend this place, I thought I would give it a try.  I was a bit hesitant as it is not the normal glitz and glam of vegas....DO NOT BE FOOLED, this place was like winning the jackpot. The brisket and tacos were some of the very best I have ever had!  The sauce was amazing!!!  I will definitely go back every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm not a big reviewer but I had to for Jesse Rae's. I had these guys cater my birthday and it was nothing short of impressive. Mike the owner opened on a Sunday for my family and I and it was great.   Food quality is top notch. Their bbq sauces are some of the best I've ever had. I forgot to mention I'm from the south and have had many different varieties of bbq. Jesse Raes is right up there with the best I've ever had. Their specialty is beef (spare) ribs which are one of the best meats I've ever had.   My whole family loved every bit of it and we will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Deliciously tasty bbq at a reasonable price..I recommend you try 2 meat combo Sausage and Brisket was really good. I will be back again soon..Thank you for the professional and courteous service."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from Jessie Rae's BBQ on Maryland Parkway through GrubHub. The food was absolutely delicious! Reasonably priced with a great portion size. I ordered  the sausage and brisket combo  as well as a brisket sandwich with the Vegas slaw and cheese sweet corn  and mashed potatoes . Absolute home run ! Thanks to you Mike and her staff. Give everyone a raise!"}
{"text":"They were out of brisket so that kid of took the wind out of the sails,  I ordered the chicken. It was decent but will likely check out other places."}
{"text":"I go here pretty frequently. I've had at least half of the items on the menu. Everything is always delicious. Plus, cartoons are playing on the tv. Who doesn't want to watch Dexter's lab while eating a brisket taco?"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery tonight and everything ordered seemed spot on!   What I like about this place is that the owner definitely knows how to run his business. He provided us with great customer service tonight!  RIBS: The meat literally falls of the bone. I think they are the most tender ribs I've ever tasted!   I think their specialty is in the different sauces they have. You can defiantly taste the difference between them. It had just the right amount of sauce applied.   I am pretty surprised that delivered food was so delicious. I can only imagine how it would be if I were to dine in.   Thanks for the delicious food! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Sorry Guys, not that good. I had the chicken and brisket. The chicken was nice and plump but was way under cooked. I cannot eat snappy chicken. I had a tough time trying to pull the leg away from the thigh. When I did it was still bleeding. The meat was very hard to get off the bone. I put it down and couldn't eat it. The brisket was very tender but was so greasy that it didn't have a good flavor. All I could taste was the grease. It also was inedible. I threw away the brisket and the chicken. They didn't have water in the place at least in the front section and the cooler was just about empty. The beans were good but that's about it. Maybe I got in on a bad day. I would say try again from all of the good reviews but I don't think I can."}
{"text":"Great BBQ I'm never disappointed here this place is sooo GOOD!  Try their maniac fries with pulled pork sausage & mac and cheese that's my fave"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 meat combo, chopped brisket and hot link with waffle fries. Used God sauce all throughout my dining  I gave them 2 stars because the chopped brisket looked like it was not smoked. I did not see any smoke rings and the brisket was chewy. I do not eat that much hot links but the one I got tasted like a regular hotdog. Not making another trip back here I think."}
{"text":"Such a great, chill dining experience! First of all, the owner served us. He made recommendations for his favorite plates, which happened to be AWESOME! My boyfriend got the Big Belt Buckle with Mac n Cheese and I had the Double Brisket Sandwich. Delicious food and good sized portions too!   My whole life (24 years) I have never liked coleslaw, but Jessie Rae's found a way to change that! Their slaw was different from every kind I've ever tried before, their style is truly original and phenomenal!   The service and atmosphere was also enjoyable- we really liked talking to the owner throughout our meal and hearing about the history of his business and definitely seeing the pride he takes in his delicious food. I can honestly say that that dining at Jessie Rae's newest location was one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've had to date!!"}
{"text":"I find brought this to work and it was really good. I had the pulled pork and baked beans. The pork was tender and came apart really mice and easy. The beans had a good smoky flavor. I would recommend"}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's is by far the best BBQ in Las Vegas.  Their home made sauces are so much better than the stuff used at other BBQ restaurants.  Last time I was at their restaurant on Valley View they brought us out a free sampler of all sorts of stuff, just to say \"thank you\" for eating there.  I'm from Kansas City and they remind me of the small town home cooked BBQ I'm used to having."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The food was incredible. Keep in mind it is a small \"hole-in-the-wall\" joint but the food and service is totally worth it! I really enjoyed the baby-back ribs and it was so fun to try the different BBQ sauces available. I really hope they continue to succeed and eventually expand!"}
{"text":"I love jessie raes bbq! It's the best I've ever had. It was always a wonderful experience every time and Mike the owner is absolutely amazing. If you want some seriously good bbq thn this place is where you should be at!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq I've ever had. I had the pull pork sandwich with the smoked corn which I devoured In Like 2 minutes. After that I began to pick off my sisters plate. She got the tri tip and sausage combo with Mac and cheese. My sister was getting mad at me cause I couldn't stop eating her food. Jessie Rae's is a must try. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's just catered a lunch for our company and left behind 45 VERY happy employees! We got the three meat combo (pulled pork, hot links and chicken) with a couple of sides (coleslaw and green beans).   We were a little concerned after Mike dropped off that there wasn't going to be enough to feed so many hungry people. To our total surprise, he came back with an extra tray of brisket. Huge points for you, Mike, for actually caring about your customers having a great experience. Most importantly, the food is off the hook tasty! The sauces are also so, so good. Yelpers, you've gotta go and check him out.  Thank you, Jessie Rae's. You've earned a whole bunch of new fans."}
{"text":"The Big Belt Buckle with BBQ mac and cheese and waffle fries w/ God sauce  and Bama sauce. ..make your taste buds dance...and hope you have an appetite because of the portion size are huge ...Brandon makes sure you Get exactly what you asked for."}
{"text":"I was going to eat at Dickey's BBQ because it was close to were I was at. I saw Jessie Rae's was 10 minutes away and a buddy has said great things about them. When we got the they were out of Beef bones and Baby Back ribs, which is a good sign for them because at 6pm they should be out of baby backs. I asked if the hot links were made in house and they honestly said no which I give them a huge thumbs up.  I had the spare ribs, brisket and baked beans and my daughter had chicken and Mac and cheese. The meat had a great smoke ring and very good flavor. The chicken was moist and delicious. The baked beans seemed like they were from a can correct me if I'm wrong but that was how they tasted. Limited selection on beverages but its a BBQ joint not a fast food chain. They are better then any chain restaurant in town but there are a couple better ones out there (not going to give free plugs). I gave 5 stars for the meat only because that is what I was there for over all 3 1/2 stars because of the beans and at over $30 dollars after tip for two people everything should be homemade."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, the belt buckle is a must-have. You won't be disappointed. I don't live here in Las Vegas but I stop by when I'm in town."}
{"text":"First time at this place and i love it...good tasting real bbq!!! And their house made sauces make it that much better...we will be back fore sure....great food and great service!!!"}
{"text":"I purchased two orders of the brisket nachos to go and they put both orders in one container. I called the manager told me sorry but she confirmed with the chef and it was two orders and it happened because they were in a rush . I split it with my wife and there is no way it was two orders. Hopefully they will use common sense next time and put the two orders in separate containers."}
{"text":"This is the first BBQ place I've been to in Vegas and I must say that I am love! Not only are the BBQ Ribs tender and tasty but the owners are the sweetest couple I've come across in a long time! Definitely try their watermelon lemonade. So refreshing!   Make sure you try all their sauces especially the God Sauce. Once you visit here I don't think you'll go to another place for BBQ."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Jessie Raes BBQ. They were prompt in replying to email and phone calls. The food was AMAZING, and all of the guests at our party were incredibly impressed and satisfied by the quality and flavor of the food served. I would absolutely call them again, and will be sure to spread the word about how awesome they are! Thank you Jessica, Mike and Brandon!"}
{"text":"They have the best baby back ribs we have ever tried in Vegas by far. Haven't tried anything else yet but if the rest of the menu is like the baby back ribs I'm positive it's going to be one of those places you will be going back to a gain and a gain."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since they opened and enjoy everything on the menu. Today we had tacos, a new addition to the menu and gotta say, best tacos EVER."}
{"text":"It was my second time eating here food was amazing! Obviously if i came back for seconds. Definitely a must try staff friendly and welcoming. Had the brisket and hot link. Thought i had taken a picture..."}
{"text":"Just stopped by this place and had the ribs and brisket. The BBQ sauce was good, but the meat alone had little flavor and the meat was dry and overcooked (both ribs and brisket). Only when I bit into the center of my ribs, was the meat tender (which was barely anything). Needless to say, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Awesome brisket. Great rub on ribs. Cool experiments in smoke. One of the best BBQ in town."}
{"text":"The food is sooooo good! Seriously the best BBQ in town. The pulled pork is amazing. Very tender and juicy yet my bun doesn't get too soggy. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is their hours. They need to be open for dinner. I can't usually get away for lunch and prefer the heavier BBQ meal at dinner anyway but they close at 4."}
{"text":"Love these small hole in the wall places.  Quick and friendly service and food came out really fast.  Manager in front made sure we were satisfied (full) when we left.  We purchased the family pack for 3.  Came with 3 sides (baked beans, corn, and BBQ mash) All 3 were really good!  Meats we had were ribs, pulled pork, hot link, and chicken.  All had amazing flavor.  We'll be coming back on our next trip to Vegas.  Keep up the great work Jessie Rae's!"}
{"text":"Barbecue takes patience and know how. I'm not graced with either gift, so I prefer to grab smoky succulent meat out when the craving strikes. My love of barbecue was unleashed in Austin, Texas. I can't get there as often as I'd like, so I must search for meaty goodness near home. I don't like chains so for a long time the valley was lacking in options.   Thankfully, times have changed and the valley is now home to some pretty great barbecue. While some are growing by leaps and bounds, others are just getting their start like Jessie Rae's BBQ. They are a small operation putting love into everything they do. Open for lunch Monday thru Friday, plus an occasional Saturday.   Just minutes from the strip on Valley View, you'll be greeted with a waft of smoke that fills the air when you pull up to the quaint building that is home to Jessie Rae's BBQ. A friendly \"hello\" welcomes you at the door, the menu is simple but offers variety. If you're lucky, the owner Mike will suggest daily specials. You'll find the best selection if you go early. When they run out, that's it for the day. It's also worth a mention that all sauces are made in house. Prices are not cheap, but real barbecue never is.   The dining room is tiny so they have a steady stream of carry-out business. My brother and I were fortunate to find a seat. It took only a few short minutes before Mike brought out our grub. My combo was Pulled Pork and sliced Brisket ($14). He opted for the Double Brisket sandwich for ($12). Both had the choice of one side, we each chose the Mac N Cheese. The combo offered a hearty portion of meat, more than I could finish. Both meats were very good. I don't know that I could choose one over the other. Which is going to make the choice difficult on future visits. The brisket was extremely tender, it had a nice smoke ring and it was loaded with flavor. It was great on its own and even better with God's sauce or Fallen Angel for a more fiery bite. The Pig Sweat was the third sauce option, and I know it is customary for pulled pork, but it's too vinegary for my liking. My brother enjoyed his sandwich too; tender brisket with the extra benefit of bold and flavorful burnt ends. The bun was fresh and it was dense enough to support the weight of the meat - which can be a feat in itself. Good eatin' for sure. I just love these mom & pop gems."}
{"text":"The food was great. You really need to look for the place, but when you find it, it's a gem. The God sauce is excellent. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"As soon as my boyfriend and I walked in, the owner Mike introduced himself and made us feel welcome right away. We decided to go with the 3 meat combo. They were out of sausage and chicken (next time we better go earlier), so we got the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs, with coleslaw as our side. Mike also recommended the pulled pork sandwich and we didn't hesitate to get that too because we were starving.   Everything was delicious, I mean everything. Usually when I go to BBQ restaurants there's always a food item that I wouldn't order again. But here, I would order everything again. The ribs were smoky and fell off the bone, the pulled pork was extremely juicy, and the brisket was cut thick. The different BBQ sauces they had were a perfect addition to the meats. My boyfriend ate the whole pulled pork sandwich without giving me a bite so in guessing it was amazing too. They even have grape Kool-Aid, sweet tea, and strawberry lemonade.   They only opened a week ago and some days they have a line out the door... Yup, I would totally wait in line for this BBQ! Even in the 100 degree Vegas heat"}
{"text":"First time trying out this new BBQ place after hearing about it! The place is a hidden gem outside strip near Mandalay Bay, easy to get to but parking is small. They have all the usual things BBQ places have pork, brisket, chicken, ribs etc. I decided to try something different, one their loaded combo's  - the Maniac fries (waffle fries, Mac N Cheese, loaded with Pulled pork & Hot links) - It was good! Pulled pork was very tender, smokey flavor, Mac was cheesey and links were add bonus - but what this place has that is different was there sauces - The Reaper / Fallen Angel (a hot, spicy- sweet sauce), God sauce is the regular BBQ sauce, but the Bama Slama white sauce was the king. Sandwiches like Jessie Mac looked good, a friend let me try  the rib tip -which was moist and tasty. Now I need to go back and try the rest -with all three sauces. A must try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed everything we ordered: brisket, ribs, pulled pork, coleslaw, mac and cheese. Can't wait to return to try the combo items. This is delicious and simple food that you want to savor and embrace. The BBQ sauces are a nice and diverse complement and are not goopy or too sweet. Highly satisfying."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The food was underwhelming for the hype and the price. One sandwich that cost roughly 15 bucks, ($3 more because I made it a combo) was the size of a Mc Double with hard and dry pulled pork and very oddly flavored brisket. The Signature sandwich \"The Jesse Rae\" sounded fantastic, yet it did not have the cheese and the pork was like jerky there was no moisture besides the slaw. This was also upgraded to a combo for $3 more which was to include 1 side and drink. We got both of the sides, corn was ok, the mac and cheese tasted like boxed, but the drinks did not make the journey. Elements of this meal were good, the sausage was great and the slaw was cool and flavored well. When all was said and done I paid $46 ($60 after delivery, taxes and tip) for 3 sandwiches and 2 sides. The driver was kind and polite and the food got here very quickly, but the meal was a dud and there was no napkins, no utensils and no condiments. All in all, would not recommend.   This was a delivery order, so maybe some of the charm is lost by not being at the restaurant. But, buying lunch for your co-worker makes you look like a chump when you pay a ton and the food is caca with nothing to wash it down."}
{"text":"The barbecue brisket is amazing! The sauces are delicious and only enhance the already amazingly delicious meat. There isn't a lot of seating, but this is definitely a place to visit while in Vegas. It's quality, delicious, barbecue!"}
{"text":"This place may look like a hole in the wall, but the food is no joke. I had pulled pork and a hot link - both were absolutely delicious and perfectly smoked."}
{"text":"This place puts Vegas style bbq on the map!  The baked beans are incredible!  I had the pleasure of watching them actually pull the pork and it was more like melting rather than pulling.  Drizzle their award winning God sauce and you've got something that'll make your eyes roll back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Tasty, moist, perfect! I got the $15 sampler. They hooked me up as a first timer, and hooked me. Thank you guys, see ya soon"}
{"text":"This place was really good!  Brisket sandwich with \"god sauce\" and waffle fries.  It's a new spot, check it out before it gets too popular with a line out the door.  Staff was super friendly and accommodating.  They didn't have unsweet tea, but made some for us on the spot.  I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Awesome food. Im from the South and this is good BBQ. Recommend this place to anyone looking for good BBQ."}
{"text":"Based upon recommendation of friends and Yelp, we decided to try out this tough to find place. It has no signage and is inside of a bar (Cactus Jack's Saloon). I'm not sure if it was an attempt to be humorous or not, but upon entering there's a note on the door that says (more or less) \"For your safety, this door may be locked. If so, please use the bell\". The place is in a mostly vacant strip mall. Once inside, I will say the food was very very good, but the person owning/ running the place said he has the kitchen so if you want any liquor you need to get it and pay separately at the bar. Similarly, the bar can not serve his food, but you can order it to go.  As I said, the food was delicious but the service was poor. The one person running it, although pleasant, seemed frazzled and unable to complete a task without being distracted. The eating area was non-smoking, but the ventilation was so poor it might as well have been smoking.  If you're just going for takeout, or if you can overlook the environment, I'd say the food is worth going for it, otherwise, find somewhere else.  [The comment on the liquor is just that - a comment, NOT a judgement. I have no problem on the arrangement but believe that potential patrons should know.]"}
{"text":"Awesome.. First time trying out restaurant, using groupon, the BEST BBQ in LV. Met Jessie Rae laid back & so dang adorable.   I had the 2 plate rib & chicken so juicy, tender try it w/the Pig sauce. My husband had the Jessie Rae sandwich he scarfed it in 8 min :)  Thank you Jessie for finally opening up a BBQ place that you can come back too.  Now open one in GV area  JB (our server) you a cool cat."}
{"text":"Terrible,  wrong taco meat. Cold food, missing food item,  waffle fries. Upside the bbq ribs and rib tip are tasty."}
{"text":"Always good stuff, I've never got a bad thing on the menu. Favorite lunch spot when I'm working on that side of town."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas. It feels like you grew up down the dirt road from 'em. Meat, sauce and sides couldn't be more delicious. Don't let the divey dining room discourage you from making this a weekly habit. All I want is for them to open up another location next to me again!"}
{"text":"Great meat, Amazing sauces, but the sides (aside from fries) were very disappointing."}
{"text":"Overpriced, poorly cut- contained lots of fat - was served cold with cold buns of cheap quality. Atmosphere is weird as its cramped and the guy eavesdrops on your conversation. And finally, the guy kept the change, giving the excuse that he didn't have any coins and made no attempt to give me my money back. He assumed I was ok with it, which I was not. Ignore their 'awards', even Famous Daves is better."}
{"text":"This is our third time eating here and we always get a large maniac fries for two people to share and its plenty. At first  the description of the maniac fries sounded like someone that was pregnant had to of come up with these but after having them let me just say there is no shortage of meat on them the sausage is out of this world good and the of combination  waffle fries, mac & cheese, sauce, brisket, and all the other goodies  is off the charts good! My hats off to the creative genius that put that combo together.   This establishment is always busy which to me is a good thing because it means not only is it good but the food is fresh. I would never be upset over a place being too small because it has been my experience that I would rather not have a business owner that has a passion for food waste his gifts on the size and looks of the place and would rather them just serve awesome food in a clean restaurant and thats exactly what you get here. The delivery was really slow but I can't say that it would cause me to not order online if I needed to.   Overall yummy, good tasting, good quality, great sized portions for the price. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome way to start a new location! Say you open at 11am and it's noon and no one is to be found...phone goes straight to voicemail.  The bar staff has stated multiple people have come in and have made multiple attempts to contact...  I would say you are making your own demise.  New business logic seems to be missing...  You can review my profile and see I only give positive feedback. My time is valuable- just as is yours.   If you are open for business you are open for business."}
{"text":"Jessie's is one of those \"diamond in the rough\" hole-in-the-wall places. Good value for the price. You get a lot of really great food. I got the jive chicken sandwich with corn and couldn't finish it. They also have a variety of BBQ sauces. It's fresh, fast, and the service is good."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a few coworkers for lunch. This place is one of the smallest I've been to, but we were still able to get a table and sit down, so no worries there. The food was honestly the best  BBQ I've ever had. The meat was tender, flavorful, and the Maniac Fries are to die for. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good BBQ. I really liked the flavor and variety of BBQ options.   I got the brisket (delicious) and pulled pork (pretty good). I also got the mac and cheese side and their unique BBQ coleslaw. Big portions; I had plenty left over to take home. I did not try the super hot sauce, but will next time.   My girlfriend got the Duke fries which were a full basket (she ordered a small, can't imagine a large) of waffle fries with pulled pork, cheese and BBQ sauce.   The service was great, our waiter/cook was alone that night but he was very attentive and discussed the menu options and gave his personal recommendations.  Really the only negative is that the south side location is a restaurant within a bar without good signage outside the bar or even within the bar (I believe the site said they are working on it), so we had a hard time finding it and knowing exactly where we should sit."}
{"text":"The \"Jessie Mac\" is one of the best bbq sandwiches I have had in a long time. I highly recommend finding this gem in Las Vegas. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We had a variety of all of the meats.  The ribs were good as well as the chicken and brisket, pulled pork was nice and tender but could've been seasoned a bit more.   I'm a homemade link kind of girl so they were just alright. I love stagg sausages (HINT HINT) I think these were farmland though, which still have a good flavor for commercial links.    The tator tot appetizer was good and filling. The three sauces were good and flavorful as well.  A good find if you are looking to eat off the strip."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Service was fast and the BBQ was delicious.  Would definitely suggest this to friends."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to eat in Las Vegas. Anything you order on the menu you will crave for weeks after you've had it. The customer service is also what makes this place amazing."}
{"text":"They totally messed up a Eat24 order. We ordered the brisket and put in the instructions no sauce and a sandwich combo with fries and a sprite. The order arrived with no fries and the brisket was slathered in sauce. The restaurant was argumentive in fixing the order."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and their sauces are delicious especially the God sauce.  I stumbled upon this place on my way back from the Outlet Mall and I'm so glad I stopped by.  My husband and I enjoyed the food very much.  The lady at the cash register is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wish I could have tried everything! Ribs were perfectly cooked with a little pull at bone the way they are supposed to be! Brisket had the right amount of smokiness and the addition of the awesome God Sauce made it perfection. Loved the potato salad as it wasn't overloaded with vinegar and you can definitely tell it's homemade. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall with great food. We had the pulled pork sandwich, hot link sandwich, ribs and chicken. Everything was very good. Probably the best pulled pork I've ever had. God sauce was (since it won't take my emoji, insert hands clapping here)"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh your brisket & pulled pork, coleslaw combo is DELICIOUS.  Brought some home to have for dinner with my husband tomorrow and is he ever going to be so happy after his long work week and travel.  I'm telling you folks, Jesse Rae's BBQ is worth the trip out to the Bruce Trent Wednesday Farmer's Market just to see that smile on your family's faces.  Also a huge congratulations on Jessie Rae's BBQ for their newly opened restaurant!  You can be sure the next time we are in Henderson we will stop by for some ribs.  Yum!  Keep up the Award Winning BBQ, Best, Cristine"}
{"text":"My wife ani are at Lucelies a few days ago and the brisket and ribs was good.  However today we ate at Jessie Raez and we will never go back to Lucelies again.  The broker and ribs was beyond fantastic & five stars.  This is a place anyone who likes BBQ must go!  Not to leave out but their BBQ Sauces aren't cold slaw are  also fantastic. We will be going back many times & are in the process of telling our froends."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall with amazing food! I had the pork nachos and they weren't what I was expecting but they were delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a mom-and-pop barbecue spot this is the place. Hidden Las Vegas gem."}
{"text":"The BBQ is excellent! Do yourself a favor and order his special, the beef spare rib. No joke, if you watched the Flintstones cartoon as kid, the rib is that big. Both the beef and Saint Louis cut of ribs are BBQ'd to perfection, not dried out, and falls right off the bone. Chopped beef brisket,and the pulled pork are tender and moist. In my opinion eat it as it is served no sauce required, it is perfectly smoked and seasoned. It is served to you with some of his signature God sauce on it already. We also enjoyed the mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. Well worth your money, and huge portions at a reasonable price. Be prepared to take delicious leftovers directly home. In addition, the bartender at Cactus Jack's was very friendly and she kept the drinks coming. We will be back. Spread the word, as this is a little local hidden gem."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good for a \"Vegas\" style BBQ joint. To their credit I only heard about the place because the owner posted a comment on a news story and referenced their restaurant. I did a little yelp research and showed up the next day. They don't attempt to be any other style of BBQ so they get a pass on the flavor and execution.  I'm a fan of pulled pork sandwiches and expect them to be a little pricey and this one did not disappoint clocking in at $11, as of this review. No sides or drink. (Hey you have to support small businesses and good BBQ is not cheap.) So the sandwich arrives and it's a handful and a mouthful- for better or worse. It's a good value, but man when you want pulled pork you don't expect huge chunks of pork to fall out of the sandwich. Everything on the sandwich was just big- chunks of coleslaw, walnut-sized chunks of pork and the bun was big too. I digress as this is \"Vegas\" style BBQ.  Could the pork use a little more flavor? Yes and it could also use a little more char. Can the sandwich be priced a little better? Absolutely! For comparison a two item combo is $14 and that comes with a side! Make the sandwich smaller by using a smaller bun. The bun was good quality, but in Vegas it'd come with a $16 burger.   Would I go back? Sure. Jessie Rae's BBQ has character, the customer service is awesome and the menu has some exciting twists. But, the flavors need to be kicked up a little, fill the empty sauce bottles and price the sandwiches a little more aggressively and we'd have a winner. ."}
{"text":"Originally from TX and been in Vegas for 3 yrs now. This is the best BBQ I've found in Vegas that could even start to compare to the BBQ in the south! Great Food & Great People! Looking forward to eating here again very soon!"}
{"text":"I am skeptical of all bbq joints. I can never get consistently tender and juicy meat. I will have to go again to confirm the consistency but judging how above and beyond juicy and tender the meat was I cannot imagine it being tough and dry. I absolutely adored the rib tips and I'm never impressed by ribs but these were meaty and tender. The pulled pork was great as is usually the case anywhere. My only complaint was with the brisket it tasted great with a nice depth of smoke ring but it was sliced with the grain instead of against it. I've never seen this, it just makes it more difficult to eat. Overall the meat quality was outstanding and the bbq sauce was very good even the spicy one made with \"the reaper\" pepper."}
{"text":"I must say I am Very disappointed in the food, I ordered with eat 24 and drove to pick up my order. the guy was nice and even though my Order had not processed in their system I showed my completed order and they made my order and thanked me for stopping in. Now on to the food, the sausage was so over done it was dry and looked burnt I posted pictures. The brisket was dry but the bbq sauce was really good. I was not a fan of the Mac n cheese o prefer mine baked. The Mac and cheese lacked flavor, based on their reviews I really expected more."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Texas, where BBQ is a staple in most households. This place does it right! Best BBQ in Vegas hands down! Moist, flavorful, generous helpings and the sauces are all spot on. Tots, fries, Mac and cheese, and corn is FIRE! If you haven't tried it your missing out. Family owned and operated, a hidden gem. Eating this makes me feel at home. Only place to go for BBQ."}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ i've ever had. . . &  the service is GREAT. . . and the  Bartenders are awesome.  . ."}
{"text":"I was recommended JESSIE RAES by a person that knows Food. The Food was so good, but that was before my wife pointed out the place needed some severe cleaning. Initially I wanted to blame the status of the place on a good rush but their wasn't an influx of people coming through and the guy that's stood at the front staring at his electronic devices was very capable of finding the time for cleaning a little.  Its sticky and dusty! Dust bunnies with more than A seasonal age were by the front order area. Nothing seems to get wiped down. Just imagine"}
{"text":"The Jesse Rae sandwich is good. Not great just good.  The bread with a special name is not that special either.   The slaw is a nothing-special-no-twist to it slaw named \"Vegas slaw\" for marketing I'm guessing.   The Hot links are not hot and taste like they are from a pretty low quality source.   The Beans...are these beans from a can?  I swear I know this taste.  Not even a dollop of your own sauce to make it unique? Hrumph.  The 2oz sauce is less than the 1.5 oz the container is labeled as. As they are only filled half way (if you considering to order take out .50 cent for 2 oz that's not even 1oz is a joke) it's not the money but it also is as it's a sad little rip off of what's advertised and what I'm receiving are two completely different things.  I call to to inform them of what I even called \"silly complaints\" but worthy of notification, to someone who couldn't care less about a customers complaint \"over the Phone\". She actually wanted me to call the delivery service to file these specific complaints. I'm ninety-nine percent sure the delivery service has nothing to do with the quality of the meal.  This place,  If they have to save money by using poor quality products and misadvertising sizes while also overpricing their items and not making them special in any way.  If they couldn't care less about customer complaints that was actual real feedback and out just a pointless hissy fit, they don't need my business or yours.   If the reviews don't turn you away  you'll only need to try them once To see for yourself."}
{"text":"M'mmmm. Best BBQ I've had, hands down. I wish I could put their God Sauce on everything! My favorite item of theirs is \"The Duke,\" which is CRISPY waffle fries (& they were even crispy to-go) topped with pulled pork (so juicy & delicious) & drizzled with yummy sauce. The aroma alone is enough to fill your heart. Don't sleep on this place! But make sure you go early in the day. I hear they sell out ;)."}
{"text":"Loving the fact that this location is so close to my house! The food is just as amazing as the other location. Still the best BBQ in Vegas ;)."}
{"text":"I recently tried the jessie raes bbq located in the cactus jacks at 10640 s. Maryland pkwy less just say quite possibly the best bbq in las vegas and the slaw is the best in las vegas you have got to try it if you love bbq"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Old school bbq pit feel when you walk in, nothin fancy, but clean. I was a little put off when I saw the prices, but I wasn't going to judge them on that after seeing the good reviews. While we waited for the food to come, we tried the sauces which there are 3 of...absolutely amazing. I got the Mcdowells Mic Ribb, my wife and son got the Jessie Mac. I got a side of mac 'n cheese and my son got a side of bbq mash, those sides alone were fantastic. Now let's get to the good stuff, my sandwich had deboned baby back ribs that were incredibly tender, no fat and sweet; the sandwich was perfectly sweet and smokey. My wife and sons pulled pork with brisket had no fat and were packed with meat. After hearing them moan, I tried a bite and it was so tender and juicy. We will for sure be coming back and next time, I'll remember the pics."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, this place is amazingly good in every way possible Please do not overlook the small building and dining room this is a must try for anyone that loves REAL bbq  The staff were excellent and helpful and did a wonderful job. I Ordered the Jessy Rae Sandwich  ( Pulled Pork ) sandwich, which was delicious and well portioned, A couple others in my group decided to try the ribs as well as sides I must say by sampling all the items ordered the food was great  Best bbq place in Las Vegas Sorry  for the amateur writing skills as I am working on them lol..."}
{"text":"*NOTE*: Dog-friendly patio!!!!  Absolutely divine barbecue! Having lived in Lexington, KY and a Savannah, GA, I know my way around great barbecue, and the folks at Jessie Rae's are right there at the top!  This is easily **The Most Tender Brisket** I have EVER tasted!  But the real treat is the \"What-The-Hell-Is-This\" deliciousness of the Maniac Fries: an \"American Picnic Nachos\", if you will, of waffle fries, Mac-n-Cheese, hot links, and your choice of an additional barbecue meat. We chose to add the pork, which was great, but next time we will use the brisket.  Although the barbecue stands on its own, be sure to treat yourself to some of the \"Slammin' Bamma\" white (yes, I said white!) barbecue sauce! It's indescribably fantastic.... Amazing flavor!  Jessie Rae's is now in my normal rotation of restaurants to visit, and without a doubt on the \"must have for lunch\" list when friends and family come to town.   Bonus points for being a restaurant that supports national veterans charities and local firefighters.   Second bonus: this is a great place to hit for lunch before or after going guns & ammo shopping at Ventura Firearms, which is one block to the south."}
{"text":"Note: As of 5/16/16, their building is still labeled as Cactus Jacks.  The boyfriend was craving for some BBQ last night, and he actually stumbled on this place via Yelp, so we gave it a try as soon as I got done with work.  Not going to lie, it was a bit confusing to get to as I read from another Yelper. The building still doesn't have the proper signage up, but thanks to other Yelpers' pics, we knew we were at the right spot. Seating was a bit confusing too 'cause there was no signage or staff member to guide us, so we just took a seat wherever.  Took awhile to see any staff in the eating area, but it turns out that that staff member is also your cook. Once we figured that out, it was all good. I can appreciate a hard worker, but I also hope he gets more future help. Other than that, he was extremely nice and checked up on us multiple times throughout the meal.  Food was definitely yummy, so you know the boyfriend was satisfied. Hahahaha... I usually order large fries, especially when it's loaded. In this case, their Duke fries was pulled pork, BBQ sauce, cheese, and waffle fries. When the server described the size of a large order, I was all about the small. In fact, I didn't even finish it. Thanks for the heads-up dude! The boyfriend ordered 2 meats and 2 sides, and he didn't finish that either. From the entire meal, our favorites was the brisket and the mac 'n cheese."}
{"text":"You don't get more local than this amazing hidden gem of a BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas.  The owners are very personable and cater each customer to their own experience.  My girlfriend and I have been here several times and have never been disappointed.  You can tell they take their time and slow cook the food to perfection!   My girlfriend gets \"The Duke\" every time we come and I get a 3 meat platter bc I can never decide between all of their delicious offerings.  If your lucky enough to be here when they have beef rib, get one if you think you can eat it all!    I highly recommend you take the time to come here bc you will want to come back the next day.  Thanks Mike, Jessica, and the cooks for making this our favorite BBQ spot in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say .... I came to Lucille's in California for some bbq and it was a JOKE compared to this place lmao  I miss you Jessie Rae"}
{"text":"Every trip into Vegas I make a point of popping into Jesse Rae's for lunch. Never disappoints.   Today, had pulled pork, sliced brisket and burnt ends. ( also the max and cheese )  Just fantastic."}
{"text":"Okay 4th time in and again everything was spot on!!! The Buckle added waffle fries w/Mac-n-Cheese...AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! And then the Mix Meat Combo added the finishing touch for BBQ craving!! Don't take it to go sit and eat it here because the conversation is equally as good! I'm glad I don't work close because I could eat this 3-4 times a week! Thank you for amazing Vegas BBQ"}
{"text":"Got the promotional rib burger, a beef rib, and the jive chicken on waffle fries. Extra sauce is a must, the jive chicken was a little dry. Beef rib had a dry rub that was a little to salty. The rib burger was just okay."}
{"text":"Rib tips and brisket to die for, if your into that sort of thing. Brisket had to smoke ring, very juicy"}
{"text":"Words can't describe my satisfaction with this place, everything and everyone was great. I came here on Saturday afternoon for an early Father's Day lunch with my parents and boyfriend. At first I thought my parents were overhyping this little business but it turns out they didn't. My boyfriend and I got a pulled pork sandwich then my parents got a full rack of ribs. The pulled pork was just nice and juicy, knowing myself and how picky I am with pulled pork I was highly satisfied with it. The ribs were amazing as well! The Mac n cheese tasted homemade that I just couldn't have enough of it. Their sauces they carry are amazing, especially the highly recommended \"God Sauce\".  I would easily recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"This is the best bbq I have had in Las Vegas, by far! The meat is smoked to perfection and the sauce, oh the sauce!! AMAZING!  This will be the new hot spot for me and my family."}
{"text":"I was recommended for the big belt buckle which consists of brisket with a mac and cheese side. Was very happy with it!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at the new location of Jesse Raes bbq the other day. I had a sample of just about everything on the menu and everything was awesome meat was very tender the sauces are all homemade and excellent and I don't even like coleslaw and the sauce they have on the coleslaw is addictive. I can't wait to go back and have it again"}
{"text":"So I have to write about the homemade sauces first of all the gods sauce is award winning and it tastes good on any of the sides or meats that are prepared fresh daily. He also makes a vinegary sauce which is God sauce with a little extra vinegar tang to it which is amazing and addictive The Fallen Angel is hot and spicy for all you lovers out there then the sauce he puts on his coleslaw I do not like mayonnaise or coleslaw and the sauce on this coleslaw is so good I have never like coleslaw before all the sides are made fresh with love the meats are smoke daily the portions are unbelievably big the owner Mike Ross has a lot of passion and drive and a beautiful heart he also wins lots of awards in the west side competitions and gives plenty to charities this place is definitely worth trying once and checking it out for yourself and see if you are hooked too. It is inside cactus jacks bar on Maryland Parkway between cactus and St Rose Parkway it is open until 2 a.m. he also just added breakfast items the original location is located on Valley View and Russell it is only open during lunch time only until they run out of food in a couple hours every day so if you go to the original first location on Valley View you have to get there early because it is packed every day go check it out it's totally worth it and awesome you're not going to find any BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas that has so much heart and passion and quality and love you can taste it and feel it when you're there"}
{"text":"If you have been to any other BBQ place in Las Vegas you how horrible this place is in comparison .  I know it has four and a half Stars that is why I went there yelpers. come on. Carnitas tasted like charcoa. The brisket was okay but lacks a real BBQ flavor. The hot sauce was okay. The mac and cheese was deplorable deplorable tasted like right out of the craft box. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in recently because I heard good things. My friend and I arrived at 1 o'clock and they were out of a few things but were promised that what they did have left was awesome. Well, it was a pile of meat on top of mac & cheese which sounds really good. The meat was massively dry and the mac & cheese wasn't very good. It was all sitting on A huge pool of Greece. My only thought is, if you're going to go to this place maybe you'll have better luck going at 10 or 11 when they first open.  The food could be better at that time."}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews and was craving the bbq.  I saw the yelp check in (16pp) which included 1 side and 3 meats (normally 20 dollars). My girlfriend and I got one each and was able to sample everything (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc)   Everything was delicious and the service was amazing! This is a family owned business the mom of the owner was worker and was the sweetest person in the world. She let us mix our bbq sauces to see what we enjoyed the most. I like the spicy one with the vinegar based one.   My side was mac and cheese and you want to talk about cheesy and gooey this is the place. there was no place for plain noodle there. Every bite was heaven and I couldn't stop eating it. My girlfriend got waffle fries and they had buffalo and ranch on them which was delicious.   Great news is that they deliver since they are about 20 minutes but I would want the whole experience. Next time I want to try the corn bread because we didn't get to and on Thursday they have beef ribs. (16.00 a rib) but I heard it is worth every bite and dollar. I am so excited to try this place out more often  Forget about Dickeys, Lucilles and every other bbq place because this place is heaven on earth obviously they have fallen angels (that's the name of a sauce).  You want good fall off the bone bbq, with house made sauces and wonderful service, you found it if you come here. This is what is great about mom and pop shops, you can taste the love in the food :)"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! The portion size is worth the cost! Great service on top of delicious BBQ. Very good quality food! Definitely best spot in Vegas for BBQ"}
{"text":"Wonderful bbq & great portion sizes. The host/server was very nice. I over heard other guest mention how much they enjoyed the food & had made it a regular spot. The 3 meat combo was awesome with plenty of food for possibly 3+ ppl to share!"}
{"text":"Top notch BBQ with awesome service. The standards are the way to go, though I was there too early to get in on the brisket. Definitely do not overlook this little gem, as it's in an odd location for a killer BBQ place and easy to overlook."}
{"text":"Oh heck yeah! That's what I was thinking when my bbq platter was placed in front of me.  I already could tell by the looks that Jessie Rae's bbq was going to be good. .. It wasn't only good.  It was GREAT!   BBQ - The spareribs are my favorite!  From the top layer of the slightly charred crust, down-to-the-bone delicious! Hands down better than the other bbq places in the area! Good ratio of fat and juicy lean meat.  I mentioned to Jessie B. how the meats had fruity smoked notes to it. She pointed out to the chalkboard menu on the wall that said peach woods were used. Mike the owner mentioned also the batch was done up North Carolina style.   I had mention it was Chad S. review and photos that motivated me even more to check Jessie Rae's out when Mike asked me how I heard about the place. Later he passed out slices of smoked Filet Mignon to all dining in. That was the special smoked meat that day. I wasn't expecting it to be so tender. Really impressed. So if you see it on the menu, get it, you won't regret it!   SIDES - I got the corn with smoked garlic butter. That's nice twist to serve corn. I'm sticking to getting that again too.  AMBIENCE: Yes the place is rinky dinky, but so was the other bbq joint when they first started out, so not gonna fault them for it.  Just heads up though be prepared to take your meal to go if you don't get there first thing when they open.  The closer to peak lunch hour, it got pretty busy. I got there maybe a little too early though just as Mike was setting up, who by the way is the bbq pitmaster extraordinaire and owner, along with his wife. Plus points for being a local family owned operation.   LOCATION: Not that hard to find. Signage is visible from Valley View and easy parking in front.   Price - in line with all bbq places I've been to. There are also  some incentives when you check in on Yelp now, I read.  On my visit here, there was only a $12/15 voucher that I took advantage of.  Even with the limited seating, it wont deter us coming here. I already decided that Jessie Rae's is our first choice for bbq when in Vegas area!"}
{"text":"This place has good food, and that's about it. The dining area is about as small as a walk in closet. They tried to fit 4 tables in there so you're going to be rubbing your ass up against the shoulders of anyone else that's already sitting and vice versa. Like I said, I loved the pulled pork sandwich that I ordered. It had pork, potatoes chips, and slaw. Definitely the place to get take out."}
{"text":"went in today to try the street tacos. soft shell, with tons of tender chicken & brisket. I'm not  a really big fan of coleslaw, but mike was more than willing to substitute with plenty of cheese, and then theres the mac n' cheese, unlike any other I've eaten, with plenty of cheese and very creamy ! mike is the man, and it shows in his customer service and willingness to deliver the best bbq that money can buy !"}
{"text":"I LOVE JESSIE RAES BBQ!!!  I went to the spring valley location and it's actually super small...I was surprised how small it was. It was about lunch time so there was a line and took a while to put an order in. Just waiting for food was uncomfortable because of how small and crowded it was. 3 bar stools I think and 2 tables that could fit 2-4 people....that's it! So be prepared to order take out.  But the food was OH SO GOOD!! We got a little bit of everything! They ran out of brisket and pulled pork which I really wanted to try. But that monster beef bone was amazing!! And the buttered corn was unforgettable! I wish I had pictures! Omg the BBQ sauces, they had 3!!! ALL Soooo good! God sauce *hallelujah emoji insert here* I wanted to take a bottle home!! I didn't get to take a bottle of the God sauce home but Mike, the owner, let me have some of that amazing BUTTER they use for their corn to take home.  Can't wait to eat here again...actually I'll just order take out next time;-)"}
{"text":"This location serves food until midnight but you can't make a phone order for pick up after 10pm.  This location of Jessie Raes BBQ is inside a local bar. So I sat at the gambling machine while I waited for my food (about 15 min) to go. I can't imagine enjoying BBQ as good as Jessie Raes at this location. The ambiance just doesn't feel right for me. I can't wait until they open their own dine in restaurant!!  The food: Even BETTER than I remember the first time (at the other location)!!  I don't usually order chicken but my husband did and I literally did not touch my ribs until I was done mooching off his chicken..or whatever he had left of it!!! It was probably the BEST BBQ CHICKEN I ever had.  The ribs were just as amazing smoked to perfection and fall off the bone!   My husband also really enjoyed the smoked sausage.  The only thing different was the buttered corn. It didn't have that amazing smoked butter. I was kinda bummed about that since that's what I loved the first time around. Maybe they ran out??  But finally....the GOD SAUCE!!! I just LOVE this BBQ sauce! It's the BEST BBQ sauce I ever had and probably will ever have! I want to buy this by the bottle!!   Save a couple bucks with purchasing a groupon!!:)"}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's BBQ just inside Cactus Jack's Saloon makes the third spot to get your BBQ fix in Henderson! The bbq served here is just as good and consistent as their location in Vegas. Difference here is, the dining area is not rinky dinky and you can get your bbq fix till 2 in the morning!! Well, at least the night owls, swing shift workers and hangry people tired of getting tacos late night welcome it for sure!  --BBQ-- I skip sandwiches and go for all meat!! Yeah, straight up hardcore! The 3 meat combo...sure why not it's just a couple dollars more. $19 gets you your choice of 3 different meats and one side. Good size portions too. I had enough to share with Mr. B.   Spareribs still my favorite, see why here [ http://www.yelp.com/biz/jessie-raes-bbq-las-vegas ] then pulled pork and then brisket. The first two being the fattier cuts of meat of course. Yum!  Mike bbq pitmaster/owner used a combo of apricot and hickory woods to smoke the meats. Combined with the spice rub used, you got a smokin hot bbq, with winning trophies to prove it from well known bbq competitions.  There's 3 different sauces offered. A spicy one. A killer hot sauce, and THE God Sauce!! This bbq sauce is sweet and fruity based.  Really should be renamed Crack Sauce, because I really wanted more and was tempted to snag the bottle from the table and take it with me, like a crack addict would. It's not for sale, I asked already. But it's in the works!!  --SIDES-- I stick with the usual, corn with smoked garlic butter! The coleslaw was nice, more fruity light taste, less mayo based.  Mac n cheese was ok, but then again, not much a pasta fan, so others may like it more than I do.  --ENVIRONMENT-- NAYS -  21 AND OVER ONLY - SMOKING is allowed - No walled off/enclosed area between bar and dining area.   YAYS - There's more room and more seating. Full menu available from early am till late night! The bar itself is pretty chill, The patrons hanging out on Friday night was a fun bunch. Good vibe and good dancin playlist I might add.   --SERVICE-- Not quite ready but functional.  The staff was pretty friendly and helpful the times I went. Met up for early dinner with my favorite friends Jessie B and Jaime W. The dining room had a closed sign but owner/bartender seated us, gave us menus and took our drink order.   Mike came out and took our order and served us too. He apologized profusely for not having everything set up yet.  He's the only one so far here, still in the process of hiring and getting a POS system in place.  So for now you have to pay at the bar.  No worries from us.  Second visit in, I just took my order to go. I called first and was told to place order at bar, so I did. Bartender knew the menu when I asked what sides I could get with my combo order. Waited a couple minutes in the dining area and another guy came out of the kitchen with my order already bagged up, but took out each box and personally verified my order per the boss man. I liked that!!!   Despite my hair smelling like cigarettes and new opening glitches, I have nothing but praise for entrepreneurs getting their product out there. Especially good bbq!  It's great to see the different bbq styles coming into Henderson! Welcome to the Hendo Hood Jessie Rae's!"}
{"text":"Wow, Jessie Ray's BBQ was part of the Pigs for Kids charity bbq Championship at Craig Ranch Park.  I purchased bbq from several places at the festival and theirs was by far the best.  Jessie, her husband and the rest of the staff were all very nice.  We had the pork sandwich along with some ribs.  Every was great and the Fallen Angel bbq sauce was fantastic.  They told their story on how they started a business and shared their mission and vision.  It is great they have to get a bigger smoker because they are constantly selling out.  We will be sure to visit the actual store when we are in the area.    I already know they food and atmosphere will be worth the drive."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best barbecue I've ever had. Mike definitely took care of me and my family. We got a catering deal from him and he took such good care of us period dropped it off picked all the stuff up give us a really good deal. Jessica who handled all the catering was very nice and helpful also"}
{"text":"My beef rib was still mooing. I didn't ask for a rare beef rib, not only that but the hot links were soft and mushy!!!! My Boyfriend and I immediately threw up after eating. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone not even my mother in law!!! I hope they read these reviews and learn from their mistakes. Till than 1 star it is."}
{"text":"Simply amazin been here 2 times now. I love the homey warm feeling i get walking in and all the food and staff are amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ!!  Enjoyed the 2-Meat Combo (baby back ribs & pulled pork) with mac & cheese (YUMMY) & Baked Beans (just ok).  Portions were generous, service was friendly & fast.  Will definitely eat there again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Couldn't get enough of the pulled pork, and the ribs fell off bone. Didn't even need any of the BBQ sauces. Cant wait to try their new candied bacon next time."}
{"text":"Mike knows his stuff!!! Ribs don't stay on the bone. At all. Pulled pork was killer, add some pig sweat and BOOM!!! Baked beans, home made Mike's Cole Slaw and all year long green bean casserole were off the chain!!! Will be back, over and over again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in Vegas! Yes the dining room is extremely small (I'm glad I went when it was slow) and yes it feels like there's no air circulating but that won't keep me from recommending it and going back. Have been to rolling smoke a few times and was my go to but the inconsistency is what made me look for other places for BBQ. Have been here 3 times and it's been the same great quality, portions, and service every time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 6 months & they are officially The Best Pulled Pork sandwich & BBQ place in Las Vegas. Great sauce & sides that compliment the meal.   Thanks for the great service & more.   Shawn"}
{"text":"the food was over boiled, it spent to much time being boiled before it was grilled. The meat was mushy with a powdery feel to it as meat does when over cooked. Mac and cheese was good but the side was very small, felt like it belonged in a happy meal so for the money I would say take a pass and skip it"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed by the hard work and dedication Mike and Jessica have put into their business. My favorite on the menu, is the ribs. Oh, and I can't forget the God Sauce. So good!"}
{"text":"Tried Jessie Rae's on a Friday for lunch. I went with 6 of my co-workers and good thing we arrived early bc there isn't very much seating. Being our first time, I looked over the menu and decided on the McDowel Rib sandwich and made it a combo with bbq mashed potatoes, drink and corn bread. It came out to around $18. A little on the expensive side. We sat down and our food was delivered to our table that had a variety of house made sauce. The sandwich had two huge slabs of rib meat. I had to take one out so I could eat it. The one I took out had a lot of the tough cartilage pieces so I had to pick those out. Overall it was good bbq but It wouldn't be my first choice if I was craving it."}
{"text":"I don't understand where everyone else went, but my food didn't match the raving reviews.  Grabbed takeout at 11:30AM on a weekday, and the food was disappointing. Maybe we came on an off day, but it was hard to find anything to like, though we were unable to try the ribs, which sound like their best meat option.  SERVICE:  An hour after opening, they were out of ribs. When my boyfriend  expressed surprise, she said \"this happens every day.\" Uh, basic supply and demand would then suggest you make more. W e'd planned to split a three meat plate. Now, with only brisket and chicken left, we'd have to double up on one. To do so, we were charged an extra $7 for the double brisket. This is ridiculous, and we were put in the position to do so by the lack of other available meats. Takeout box was put  on the counter, had to get bags and utensils separately. If the majority of your orders are for takeout, perhaps someone should be bagging up orders appropriately.  Just a thought.  THE FOOD BRISKET: My initial thoughts were complimentary. But as we got away from the edges of the piece of meat and into the interior, the meat became dry and unappealing. The brisket was the best of what we tried, but we didn't finish it. CHICKEN: It was fall off the bone tender, but lacked flavor and was also on the dry side. This went unfinished as well. MAC AND CHEESE: I found it interesting, and kind of fun, that they used bowtie pasta for the mac. But it was falling apart and the only flavor seemed to be from the seasoing sprinkled on top. The first few bites were fine, but again, as we got more into the dish and the noodles broke into pieces and the seasoning was gone, flavor was very one note. I do like that they were nicely saucy (dry mac is the worst offense!), but this version was lacking. SAUCES: Okay, even average bbq can be made to shine with a good sauce. BF grabbed two different types for us to try and both were gross. One was sickeningly sweet with a chemical-like after taste we couldn't place, while the other (the Godfather?) was similarly sweet but with a punch of pepper. This wasn't balanced, it was just pepper. No bueno!   I may be from Texas and used to great bbq, but after two years in Vegas, I've scaled back my expectations-- and even so, this spot didn't meet them.  Perhaps I'd feel differently if I tried the ribs everyone raves about, but I don't feel inclined to give them another try for a while."}
{"text":"The smell as you walk up is the clue you are going to have a wonderful food experience.  Outstanding que full of flavor and taste. Sauces match the meats so well. Sides were tasty and happy. Want to leave just so we can come back again!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ place in Vegas! Small family owned feel inside, savory/tasty, fall off the bone melt in your mouth taste with anything you order. We came with 3 picky children and there were no complaints or questions, they were too busy eating and savoring until the very last bite!! Lots of diff sauces for you to chose from as well, would highly recommend THE BEEF RIB if they have it available. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! High recommend eating here! Portions are huge and the customer service is as good as it can good!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best barbeque in Las Vegas. My wife and I really dig the chicken and the ribs. There barbeque sauce is so addicting and I wish I had more but I didn't ask for any extra and wish I did because it was some of the best I  have ever had. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for excellent barbeque and quality ribs and chicken. Chicken was tender and juicy and ribs were the perfect flavor and balance."}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ. Only place I really liked in Vegas. Doesn't look like much from the outside but you know the old saying."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We have been to Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, and North Carolina.  This place is in our top 5 of BBQ joints!  Yea the place is small and not much of a restaurant per se, but the food rocks."}
{"text":"Okay so my husband and I got there, he was kinda busy taking care of a customer who was ahead of us and was an order to be picked up, he already saw us (made eye contact and everything) and didn't even bother taking our order. So then fine, whatever he was busy, I guess. Then about 3 minuets passed, another couple went in and as soon as he saw them he jumped into cashier mode and took their order!! Tf, right I know!! S'all good.. strike two though. So then he finally got my order, paid and as I was entering in my email address (just so he doesn't have to print out a receipt)... he cancels it! This guy got me p.o. the whole time I was there... darn good thing his bbq spot is closest to our home.. that's the ONLY reason why we order our bbq at this small cramped up bbq joint with unreasonably priced food!!  Looking for a better southern style bbq spot with better customer service here in Las Vegas, if you know one, help a sister out!!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here yet, but so proud of them for stepping up with the massacre and helping survivors, will definitely be the first place I go now for BBQ, and I love all the way up in North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Award winning sauces- yes it is.  Made the BBQ so much more.  Their sandwiches are awesome and big.  The ribs is out of this world- soft juicy falls off the bone. Great hole in the wall place. Definitely will come back to try more of the menu.  Much better than Rollin smokes- which has become commercialize."}
{"text":"This is unfortunate and a tough review to write. The food was good. I'm not sure it's as amazing as a lot of other people claim, but it was very tasty. Great variety of BBQ sauces. Each one very different and very distinct. Good amount of food for the price? Not so much. But hey, it's a tiny little house made BBQ joint, so that's to be expected. I was in there when a construction worker ordered his lunch...$18! Ouch!  We ordered the pork'd in Vegas sandwich & the Jessie Rae. Pork'd in Vegas is the clear star. Hearty, balanced. Everything you want in a BBQ sandwich. The Jessie Rae is served on sandwich style bread, very light, very airy. It had potato chips in it along with other unnecessary ingredients. I didn't think this sandwich was filling or balanced.   But the real reason why I could only give two stars....the flies. The amount of flies flying inside and landing on us as we were eating was one of the most unpleasant dining experiences ever. Even if it was the absolute best food I've ever had...even if the entire world proclaimed this place as the holy grail of BBQ, I couldn't return or even order to go...if there were that many flies in the dining room, one could only imagine what was going on in the kitchen.  Jessie Rae, best of luck to you...you make a darn good pork sandwich."}
{"text":"First time here; had a large portion of the \"Belt Buckle\", which is an enormous, savory platter of mac 'n cheese smothered in freshly smoked brisket and topped with various sweet/tangy sauces. While a little on the luke warm side of temperature, the dish lacked nothing in delicious flavor. I wish the drink selection included something besides a 5 option soda fountain and water from said soda fountain (maybe some brewed tea and lemonade since it's a BBQ joint), and who doesn't love something sweet after all that savory meat (I'm thinking banana & nilla wafer pudding). Overall a great little BBQ joint in an unsuspecting part of town, with warm, friendly service, albeit a bit cramped inside with all the loyal customers who feel compelled to return. Plus with a delightful slogan of \"It's All About the Butt\", I definitely recommend Jessie Rae's BBQ!"}
{"text":"This place is INSANE. The BBQ is exactly what you would want. The meat appears to be made hot and fresh every day because once they run out, that's it. They're really more of a Togo spot but we've eaten inside before. It's small and cozy and the staff is really nice. I haven't had anything I don't like here. We usually get the combo meals with brisket, pulled pork and a side of ribs. Their side of buttery corn is the best I've ever had. I can't say enough good things!! I would eat it every day."}
{"text":"This place was good, the waffle fries are delicious! I would come back just for the waffle fries alone! The staff was nice and our order was ready for pickup at the scheduled time.   We had the brisket which wasn't that tender and had more fat than I prefer but some folks prefer that and say it adds flavor.   We also got the cole slaw and cornbread which were okay. The waffle fries were the true star of our order though, they were perfectly seasoned, soft, and thick! Dipping them in the BBQ sauce elevated the flavor explosion in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Great food, good price, friendly service. A little hole in the wall, you should definitely visit. Food came way faster than expected."}
{"text":"Well the day finally came, when finally made it here. I have been trying to get to Jessie Rea's BBQ since they opened for 3 reasons. One they're \"Award Winning\" sign out front, two they are super close the my work and three all the Yelp reviews.  Ever since they opened their doors they have been instantly getting raving reviews. Then one day my co-worker went there for lunch and she was hook. I got to try a piece of her brisket and burnt end that day and I too was hook ans was craving for more. I am a bit surprise it took me so long to try them out but I eventually did and I was very happy camper.  Pulling up into to the restaurant in an industrial office area where most cafes and food joint like this caters to surrounding business you don't expect much and as you walk in there's not a whole lot...just a couple of tables and chairs no fuss no muss just the essentials and straight to the point BBQ.   A guy name James took my order over the phone being super helpful and suggestive, as well as everyone there. I placed an order for 2 sandwiches with one being free because of a handy dandy coupon I had. After checking in on Yelp I also was suppose to receive a free a small kool-aid but they were out so I got a full bottle of soda instead, \"sweet I scored thanks Jessie's BBQ\". The amazing smell of BBQ when you walk in makes your stomach growl and your mouth water. I couldn't wait to dig in.  The Jessie's sandwich was full of juicy pull pork and amazing slaw and I hate slaw but their's was so good. The sauce was freaking awesome and even though I didn't get potato chips on my sandwich like I was suppose to it was still bomb. The Brisket sand was killer, of coarse it was because of the brisket, the Mac a cheese was cheesy and deliciousness. The sausage though tasted a little like store bought sausage when the the menu made it sound like it made made in house and amazing. I'm not sure if it is made in house or store bought but I really didn't care for it and. Any how all of that was sandwiched between two amazing buttery buns with softest warmest and not over kill with the dough.   Each sandwich costs around $11-$14 bucks with no sides or soda but for about $3 or so more you can make it a combo. A little too much for an everyday lunch for me but it was worth it and that's BBQ price for you. So the next time I want to splurge on lunch I will definitely splurge here."}
{"text":"Came here for my third time and finally had the Rib Sandwich I keep hearing about. At some point I'll try everything on the menu because everything I have is amazing. Not to mention the new \"God\" sauce is on point. Mike and his Mom are great with customer service also. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I completely forgot to do a food review on Jessie Rae's BBQ. Back in April 2016 Jessie Rae's catered our \"After Wedding Hangover BBQ\" and the food was absolutely delicious. We had a budget and they provided more than enough food plus extras. Some places could have sold me everything and be just shy over or under my budget but i felt we got more Jessica gave me exactly what we wanted for a great price.   The food was delivered on time and the person that delivered it \"I believe he was the other owner\" was awesome he was very helpful getting all the food setup and answered all of our questions as we were hung over and drooling ready to eat.    We had 55 guest to entertain and they all were blow away about the bbq. If I could write 55 reviews for each person that attended they would all give Jessie Rae's 5 stars with great comment.   I apologize Jessica that I didn't right a review sooner but I will stop by next time my wife and i are craving BBQ which is all the time :)   S"}
{"text":"The food was good but the only down fall is the side portions are small for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Thank you for remembering all the Veterans out there! Your pull pork sliders combo free to any veterans are appreciated.  Besides the fact that they are great.  The smoke corn with smoked butter is a new twist for me.  Definitely ordering it again along with the bake beans."}
{"text":"I work down the street from Jessie Rae's and everyone in the office has been talking about how amazing and delicious it is and I need to go there for lunch like right now. So, I did and everyone was right!   I had the pulled chicken sandwich and while the chicken was great, the sauce is just unbelievable. Best bbq sauce I have ever had.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I kept seeing friends check into this spot and the pictures they were posting literally had me drooling. I had to try it out.  After browsing the menu for a bit, I called in an order for pickup. I  spoke with James who was very pleasant. He took my order and told me it would be 10-15 minutes. Jessie Rae's is approximately 2.6 miles from work, so I jumped in my car on my lunch break on 2/15/16 and headed over. If you have any kind of navigation device on your phone it will lead you right to the place. Yes, it's small and the location is in a commercial complex, but there is visible signage from Valley View. Matter of fact it's right off Valley View and Dewey.  ANyway I ordered a 2 meat combo, and went with the sausage and brisket. The combo comes with one side and I choose slaw, but opted to get an additional side of mac and cheese.   The Good -Customer service was great. As I said James was very pleasant both over the phone and in person when I picked up my order. He hand delivered the food to me and showed me the food before closing up the box. You can tell he takes pride in what he does. -The pig sweat bbq sauce was amazing. It's a vinegar based sauce which happens to be my fav, and it was fucking delicious. It was so good that  I drank it out of the little cup (don't judge me). -The sausage was really good. It was chopped up into bite size pieces, perfect for popping into my mouth. It was a bit well done but that is actually how I prefer it. It had just the right amount of spice and a lot of flavor. I would order this again. The slaw-oh em gee this shit was amazing. It was tangy and creamy and the cabbage was fresh and had a nice crunch to it. I would order this again. -The price was super reasonable. I ordered a 2 meat combo and 2 sides for around $17.50.   The Bad -The mac and cheese was not good. Although it looked tasty, it tasted like when you were younger and your mom would make you eat reheated Kraft mac and cheese the next day. It was very dry and had a lot of pepper mixed throughout. I can't see myself ordering this again. -The brisket. Contrary to other reviews this brisket was not dry at all, in fact it was very tender and had good smoky flavor. While it was tasty, it was very fatty. You will have to see my pic to understand what I mean. I would think twice about ordering this again.   All in all though I think this place is pretty good. I love supporting local businesses and there are a few things I want to try out like the ribs and pulled pork. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Best bbq period. Don't leave without getting the The rib sandwich. Jessie is hands on with his guests makes you feel like he cooking for family."}
{"text":"OMG, best bbq ever. Very tiny place with 6 tables but the food was fabulous. Small business with big heart,  and make sure you have a big appetite because they don't do small here. Very satisfied"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best things I've had to eat in a long time. It was amazing. If you haven't been to Jessie Rae's BBQ on valley view/Russell rd than you need too. Absolutely amazing food this time I had the Big Belt Buckle but I've also tried the Jessie Rae sandwhich and it was great too. The God sauce here is absolutely heavenly(pun intended). Do yourself a favor and come here huge portions at a fair price."}
{"text":"Upon entering-the place has real charm and seems to be our kind of place. Okay so where to start! we waited for a while to be seated only to find out we could seat our selves, no signs or hostess to let us know this. Ordered our food only to have the server come back to say at 5:00 had no chicken.  So we ordered again the Brisket was super fatty and the ribs were burnt on one side not to harp on one subject but the mashed potatoes were cold as well super disappointed. Our server while being super sweet was very absent during dinner, I would have like my potatoes to be warmed, if not replaced,no refills were given during dinner. Our server could not be found. This customer would have been more lenient on this restaurant if they had been busy but they only had three tables, no wonder right. From what I could tell they won't mind if we don't return, as their food and the customer service clearly shows lack of concern for repeat Business. I was not happy to give this place a bad report as I was really looking forward to a nice dinner."}
{"text":"The problem with most BBQ places is that they try and get big way to fast. When they do this they lose the passion for the food. Then they turn into an assembly line and portions get smaller to cut cost and jack up profits.   This is not the case for Jesse Rae's. The passion is truly alive in the food that is served. I have had almost every BBQ place in town and I can not express how much I love the food here.  Fair prices for a great meal!    You must take the time and stop in for lunch. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"One of the best barbecues I have ever had. The Ribs were perfect, the brisket was moist and the barbecue sauces were spectacular. This is a must stop if you are in Vegas. The side of corn is delicious too. Great joint."}
{"text":"Hot Diggity Dawg!  I must say thanks to my Fellow Yelp reviewers for spreading the word about this place.  Everything was on point from the juicy tender Brisket and Pulled Pork. The creamy Coleslaw,  zesty flavorful baked Beans, Honey buttery Corn Bread and their buttery Corn side...not to mention their oh so tasty bbq sauces. My Stomach and Taste Buds thank you.  Cheers Jessie Rae! keep on keeping on..."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a 4 star but I would rate it just a bit under that.  First big complaint is it's impossible to find if you didn't know it's inside Cactus Jacks, even then I wasn't sure where it was!  That was a full star deduction for that, make it easy for customers to find you!!  I really wanted BBQ so I took the effort to sort it out.  The food was delicious, I would have preferred to sit and eat but took it to go instead so the sauce wasn't put on the wings.  I ordered brisket, ribs, and wings.....all were good but not as fresh as I would have liked, just a slight deduction for that.  The service was awesome, I was able to order and get out rather quick.  Good place to go if you are craving some BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  All the food was beyond excellent. I myself have struggled to find excellent bbq in Las Vegas so I feel very fortunate to have found this place. I am excited to try the baby back ribs the next time I come back. The brisket and spare ribs were fantastic."}
{"text":"My new favorite BBQ spot.  We had dinner here this past Saturday evening.  The food was amazing and we will definitely return!  I got the We Pork'd In Vegas combo! Oh so good!"}
{"text":"So freaking bomb! I've eaten here three times in the last week. Always awesome food and the owner is very personable."}
{"text":"If you think you've had the best BBQ but haven't been to Jesse Rae's, you're missing out. It's the best BBQ in Vegas. I ordered the Jesse Rae pulled pork sandwich and if you do...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is ahhhmazing!! Loved it, and that's coming from a girl who was raised in the south.  The brisket was so tender it was hard to eat it with a fork.  And the baby back ribs were outstanding. Perfect hole-in-the-wall find."}
{"text":"The choices on the menu all seemed delicious, we were a bit confused on which to try. However, I'm pretty sure everything would satisfy your tastebuds! Definitely telling all my friends and family about this place. The owners are definitely great people as well which is a plus!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best BBQ places in town!  Great lunch specials and their Brisket is favorite.  I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's is phenomenal. Best BBQ I've ever had. I come here all the time. Way better than those big chain restaurants"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my order of ribs. For whatever reason there was an aluminum taste from the sauce. And the Mac and cheese was generic and nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Alright this was an interesting experience. First off, I love BBQ, so much so that I created Campfire BBQs Yelp Page for them. Luv to you Stefan!  Came here on a Tuesday night, after hours. This other really cool Sarah got the owner Mike to open up for a Meet Up group of about 14, so we had a catered style event.  Appetizer - Big Belt Buster: Mac n cheese, burnt ends of the brisket, BBQ sauce, etc, overall it was good but I appreciate good meat so I didn't need it all combined.  Sides - Mac n Cheese: overall it was good, except the portion I had was heavily peppered, to the point I didn't eat it - Corn: absolutely amazing with their seasoned \"queue the trumpets' butter - BBQ Mashed Potatoes: very good and heavy - Green Bean Casserole (cause it's my restaurant and I can): I love green bean casserole and this did not disappoint.  Meat - Chicken: amazing, juicy, moist, perfect  - Pulled Pork: great texture and worked very well with the BBQ Sauce - God's Sauce - Brisket: A-OK, but I'm a snob on this because of Stefan - Pork Ribs: tender and fell off the bone, good flavor - Rib Tips Sausage: wow - this was new to me, they make it in house, grinding and all, it was spicy and really different  Overall - I'd come back when I'm in the mood for a heavy lunch, super close to work and only open during the week for lunch. They do have another location inside Cactus Jack's Saloon so you can get their food there 11am - 4am in case you can't make it here. Check it out, when the weather is nice, they have a small patio as well."}
{"text":"I love Jessie Rae's!! Try something different every time, it's all amazing! And the staff and owner are really friendly. Their God Sauce is my favorite too, a must try. Obvious why they have so many awards"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite BBQ spots I've been to. The food is delicious and the service is great. The location is off the strip and the place is small so it's hard to miss. I highly recommend Jessie Raes BBQ if you're a BBQ lover like myself. Definitely has that home cooked taste."}
{"text":"Talk about literally the definition of hole in the wall restaurant. But one well worth going out of your way too try! I came for late lunch for recovery meal after long training day. The bad thing about coming for late lunch is most of the good stuff is out. They only open for lunch service and am sure since small operation just started up might make limited amount everyday The owner assume telling me the sausage one of the first things to go. =(( Talk about mouth watering description making the sausages fresh everyday incasing them and the whole works. Really nice! More times then not see sausage on the menu it not in house made fresh everyday. I feels like speaks volumes about not just the sausage but talking about my pulled pork sandwich I ordered. You can tell the amount of passion the owner has for bbq and love that in any business owner more less small business owners just starting up. I love talking about food.   So the pulled pork sandwich (We Porked in Vegas) talk about hearty sandwich. You know its hearty when the meat is overflowing from the bun and the cole slaw on top doing the same. The names they have for the dishes I think is pretty cool idea. The natural dripping added another flavor and brings it all together. I reading about the God Sauce. I feel like totally legit. I honestly put that up there with just by itself! Top bbq sauces of all time. The other two sauces honest thought was ok but the GOD sauce. You need make sure get some when come visit. It had little kick but just the right about of balance that not pure heat in bbq sauce. The waffles fries was good. I really the enjoyed the seasoning that was on it.   Say hole in the wall. There was no cars in the parking lot when pulled in. I walk in no one at the cashier stand no one around. I see bell ringer like checking in hotel or something. It felt odd for me hit it. Not very long then someone think owner came out of the kitchen. I told him first time explaining me the menu. I went with the pulled pork sandwich. He went back made it served me and cashier. Now if that not small business?? What is?? The place only has two tables of four and three bar stools. So if planning on eating in all about timing or just order food to go. No fountain machine. The drinks not sure since came late if full selection. You pick something out of stand up refrigerator. I had iced tea. They do make three fresh gallons of different juices or something that pour into cup. I forget the names of them. I just got bottle drink. The prices are very reasonable and get great portion. Not sure about the sides. I never really notice much of selection. Everything was new too me.   Not doubt plan on coming back really want try some of the sausage. I know there been push of bbq joints around Vegas. I love this small hole in the wall places that not about environment. Food stand out. The owner has passion for bbq, friendly, and really looking forward trying more of the menu. Only reason not five stars is only tapped the surface of the food here although really more like 4,5 stars. If in the area or not got come out try Jessie Rae BBQ."}
{"text":"Ordered the jessie rae sandwich and I was not disappointed. The pulled pork was delicious and the different sauces complimented. I like my food spicy so the spicy bbq sauce was my favorite."}
{"text":"Love how the owner of this establishment sends threatening private messages of you give his piss hole of a food place a bad review! Don't worry never eating in this rat hole again. Good luck to anyone who does!"}
{"text":"Double Brisket sandwich = delicious. As far as the Caesar salad goes, would not recommend again. Did well on the BBQ but would not go there just for a salad."}
{"text":"They have one huge, unforgivable flaw at this restaurant: they close at six! Who does that? I can only go here on my weekends because I don't make it for dinner when I am working. Jessie Rae is the boyfriend who lives in another state just to keep you interested.   Once I get over the betrayel to my schedule that is closing at 6pm, I love this place. I love the hole-in-the-wall, home town barbeque vibe. The place is really small, I didn't see a maximum occupancy sign but I assume anymore than 15 people would be some sort of fire hazard. There are only four tables covered in plastic table clothes, which is what I like in my BBQ joints! It's the down to earth backyard BBQ realness that I crave. My only complaint here is that I did not see or could not find any wet wipes or hand sanitizer. I left with my hands feeling pretty sticky which is uneccesary in our day and age of magic, one-time-use disposable hand cleaning clothes.   The loaded plate was literally everything. Tater Tots and waffle fries with cheese and pulled pork and BBQ sauce. Next time I get this I am going to ask for some sauce on the side so I can SMOTHER it. It was delicious.   The mac and cheese was good too, as well as both of the meats on my boyfriends plate. The only thing I would not get again is the green bean casserole. I thought this came out watery and the only friend onion crunch was on the top. I make green been casserole every year for my family's thanksgiving so I am some what of an expert - lol - avoid this for the other delicious sides offered by Jessie Rae's"}
{"text":"This place is a great little gem of Las Vegas! Came in from Orange County for some work and gave this place a shot, glad I did. Friendly staff, neat atmosphere, and great sauces. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ spot in Vegas. I come here regularly simply because of the service. The first time I came here, I was 5 minutes early for a pick up and when the owner brought me my order he said he upgraded my order for the wait. What wait!? I was early and he literally almost gave me 2 full orders of food for the price of one! Great place and great service. I recommend this spot constantly and will continue to frequent this place until my cholesterol knocks the roof off, lol."}
{"text":"Not sure if I went in on an off night, I went yesterday night, but I went because of the high reviews.  My experience was nothing like the reviews.  I ordered two of the corn, two of the beans, two of the Mac and cheese and half a rack of ribs.  The Mac and cheese were dry, tasted like they had sat all day under a heat lamp.  The corn was dry as well got the same feeling like they had sat without moisture all day.  The beans were good no problems with them. The ribs, three pieces were so over done I could not even eat them.  The other pieces were tender but the outside had way to much char on them to enjoy the meat.  Every time I bit into one the black char would be all crumbly and gritty.  I hope this was just a fluke but I really did not enjoy this meal that cost good money at all, this was my Mothers Day Meal."}
{"text":"I just got done the best bbq. We eat bbq weekly but just found the best in Vegas. Meat falls off the bones. Unbelievable corn on the cob. Baked beans and Cole slaw!!!! This is a must have. Huge portions and amazing food. Watch out food network."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Amazing and friendly service! The owner took the time to answer all of our questions about the food, including preparation and showing us where they cook. I am very particular about barbecue and this will be my go to stop from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered take out at 230 in the afternoon,  ordered the 3 meat combo with tri tips, chicken, ribs  side of mac an cheese, baked beans,cole slaw. They were out of tri tip???? Smh gave me sausage instead  the chicken was shredded was ok the ribs were awful,  they used aluminum foil to cover the baked beans, cole slaw, mac an cheez  the beans leaked all over again the place,  no lids for take out, an no tri tip interesting, i will never order from here again"}
{"text":"OK take a look at the pics, enough said. Fine I'll make it longer.  Jessie Rae's BBQ is a small BBQ joint that you'll should try if you haven't already done so. Yea they're small 10 slim people could maybe fit inside. There were only 2 tables and a few stools on the inside and a few tables on the outside. They get busy during lunch and I've heard they do run out so come early. Got there at 11:30 am no one was there but a few minutes later it was packed.  Obviously when it comes to BBQ everyone is gonna have their favorites mines ribs and brisket and of course that's what I went with. The ribs here were tasty. It had a nice bark, a good smoke ring, and was real tender. Mmm I'm craving these ribs right now. The brisket I got were served a little cold, not sure if that's how they usually do it but would've enjoyed them warm or hot at least. Will need to try again.  If you like sauces on your BBQ they have three of them. The Pig Sweat which is their Carolina style vinegar sauce, the Fallen Angel which is their spicy sauce made from Carolina reaper peppers supposingly one of the spiciest peppers out there, and their God Sauce which I didn't get to try. Enjoyed the Fallen Angel and didn't care to much for the Pig Sweat.  They also have these things where it starts with a pile of waffle fries, mash potatoes, or mac n cheese then top it with sauces, cheese, spices, and meat. Doesn't look like its good for you but I want one.   I'm for sure going back."}
{"text":"The owner is just asinine. I would never eat from a place that come off as rude and brash like this. Arguing over Yelp with a customer, yikes!"}
{"text":"Came for my first time. Their bbq brisket is amazing along with their waffle fries and Mac & cheese. Also their gods sauce and fallen angel sauce was really good. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Holy. Shit. The best BBQ I've had in a very long time. Get the McDowell McRib sandwich and the Maniac Fries."}
{"text":"If you want REAL BBQ, head to Jessie Rae's. This place is the absolute best bbq I've ever had in my life and Im from Tennessee. That's a bold statement i know. But Im dead serious this place is the spot for bomb brisket and ribs."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ place I've ever been. Even my friend who doesn't like BBQ. She still ate whole rib and half brisket. Unfortunately we only have one stomach, absolutely will come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Great Food, the staff is so friendly.  I absolutely loved this place after hearing about it through some friends!!!  This truly is the best BBQ in town!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food! And friendly service. A little tight inside and could use better table set ups. Other than that, very satisfied."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars because let's face it, very few things are perfect in this world. However, I have to give credit where credit is due and this place kmows its BBQ!   I had the three meat combo of brisket, pulled pork and hot link and all three were excellent! Nice smoky flavor and very moist, almost as good as what I make at home, LOL!  The side I had, the potato salad was definitely not made by Susan, LOL! I hope you get the comedic reference.  The only downside is the closer they get to closing the more likely they are to run out of various items.  It was strongly suggested by the cashier that for future reference to call ahead to make sure they have what you want and ask them to set it to the side for you."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Great sauce. Great service. Very personalized. This is a very no frills type of restaurant. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for some good bbq."}
{"text":"What a find! The brisket was delicious and the baby back ribs were to die for. Dad's pulled pork sandwich was perfect with the dollop of coleslaw. Sauces are amazing. Staff was super friendly. I couldn't go 5 stars because of the beverage situation. Pepsi only fountain and no beer!"}
{"text":"This is a review in part for the restaurant and also for Eat24/Yelp. I placed my order for pickup and went to the restaurant to find that there was no signage at all. I called the restaurant just to be sure I had the right place but got a busy line. I walked into the bar and found the place only and was greeted by the bartender. He told me that he hadn't received the order and asked me what it was so he could re-ring it.   While he went to the back I got a call from a Eat24 employee who told me they hadn't been able to reach the restaurant for 3 days and offered to cancel my order since I was already at the restaurant. The guy on the phone at some point went off on a tangent and said how he liked the Yelp app better than his own company's because you can see the food health ratings then promptly told me he likes to know when there's crap in his food. That was totally what I needed to hear in that moment.   When the bartender came back out he told me they no longer had a couple items that I wanted, which was fine. I just told him to give me whatever there did have. He went to the back again and came back out later saying that they actually didn't have any food to sell at all (I came at 9:30pm, they supposedly close at midnight). The bartender was genuinely apologetic and offered to have my food rung up tomorrow which wasn't a good option. I ended up just leaving without any of the food I ordered and 20 some odd bucks that I couldn't use in my bank account until Eat24 refunded me.   Not really sure what kind of game these guys are playing over here but I definitely don't want to come here again and go through something like this."}
{"text":"Just plain great.. if you do the yelp coupon, it will cost you $17 to eat whatever is on the menu. So much food that there was plenty of leftovers. Definitely a must when you are in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Family owned places like this never seem to disappoint. I love the creativity behind the homemade sauces they keep on their tables and the genuine recommendation to what tastes good with what you order. I'm not much of a BBQ lover but my boyfriend is...glad I listened to him and gave this place a try. Delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, pulled pork was very dry. Waited 5 minutes before anyone came to front to assist us, when they came out there was no greeting just asked what you want. The concept of the Jessie Rae sandwich is awesome; however pork was very dry and had to cover with God sauce to make it worth eating. God Sauce was good. Overall not a good experience, maybe I caught them on a bad day, will take a lot of convincing to go back."}
{"text":"My new favorite BBQ place. Only downside is that it's a tad pricey, location is not ideal, and not much seating. But the food makes up for it for sure."}
{"text":"Must try \"the duke\" with the mac and cheese. It will change your life. Also don't forget to drizzle more god sauce on your feast. Don't take my word for it, just try it for yourself. No ragrets. It also helps that the staff are incredibly friendly they even remember the regulars. Great place to have a soulful meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ Sándwiches  We has Jessie RAE and added their fantastic \"GOD Sauce\".  Really enjoyed the food.  Thanks!!!o"}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ I have ever had. Been coming here for a couple years and this award winning BBQ has never let us down. Come early for a seat during lunch or you can always sit on the outside benches. They recently expanded to the seating area inside so now they have even more tables. I have tried the Jessie Mac sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese 5/5 and thought it couldn't be beat.   Today, to my delight I found a new favorite! The belt buckle (guaranteed to make you loosen your belt buckle if you finish your plate). It comes with a bed of Mac and cheese and then topped off with BBQ beef brisket perfectly seasoned and add some signature award sauces to make it even better. Today I had the God Sauce and Fallen Angel which is made from the hottest pepper on Earth, the Carolina Reaper. They have also recently added a couple sauces to the tables: Slammin Bamma (similar to ranch but even better) and Mustiah (mustard based sauce).   As long as Jessie Rae's is BBQ'ing this place is a must try for any BBQ lover! They have another award winning sauce called Pig Sweat which is also good. No wonder this place ranks high on Yelp with a 4.5 over 400 reviews.   Can't wait to come back and get messy!"}
{"text":"Great service! The smoked chicken with mac and cheese and waffle fries is really good. The pig sweat sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"So we checked this place out about 3 days ago After all the rave reviews on Yelp. We order the belt buckle, brisket sandwich and ribs. The belt buckle was extremely salty and the rest were ok. Maybe they were busy but we'll give them another chance and order again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here love this place they were so friendly and awesome I had the best experience thank you for making my day the Sauce there in from heaven so delicious"}
{"text":"Great. Owner is really friendly and the Rae pork sandwich was really flavorful. I enjoyed their sweet BBQ sauce ; the fallen angel sauce is incredibly hot! You've been forewarned.    I also got to try one of their ribs , which also was tender.   Next time I will try their \"we porked in Vegas\" because during my five day excursion I wasn't so successful with the other type :("}
{"text":"Came in with a client based on the reviews and our mutual desire to get some BBQ.  Small establishment located in a tiny strip mall with limited parking but the trip was worth it as the BBQ was creative and fantastic. I went with the Household of Three sandwich which consisted of smoked pork sausage, pulled pork and beef tips served on a brioche roll with slaw and onions.  It was certainly one of the better BBQ sandwiches I've ordered and the combination, while sounding daunting, worked well together as the various barbequed meats worked nicely with each other and the spicy scotch bonnet BBQ sauce they had tableside. I tried a few of my guests waffle fries as he could not finish them and also enjoyed these.  Only reason it was not 5 stars was owing to every table we tried to sit at was filthy was sauce spills and crumbs from the previous diners."}
{"text":"Awesome delicious BBQ in Las Vegas! We went there two days in a row, had brisket, pulled pork and pork ribs. All were wonderful, high quality, just right amount of spices and sauce. Sides were tasty too, corn and chunky mashed potatoes. Owner Mike was great, asking customers how they liked the food, the lady taking orders at the register very friendly and helpful. They do run out of popular items like other people said, need to get there early in the day. We liked this BBQ so much that we bought a whole rack of ribs to bring back to San Diego! Looking forward to coming back and having it again! Good luck to the owners, hope this place does very well."}
{"text":"Who knew I was passing a gem of a BBQ spot each day going to and from work? Well after I wised up I decided to stop on by for a bite. The dining area was packed but there was one table free just for me. The menu looked all good,especially since I didn't have anything to eat that day. Any who opted for the Jessie Rae sandwich with waffle fries and a cornbread muffin. The wait wasn't long at all and my server was a very kind lady. Once my plate was brought to my table, the aroma from the tasty goodness wafted up to my nose and sweet Jesus it was time to grub. The sandwich was amazing, the meat tender bread crispy, waffle fries golden blonde and delicious. Loved the fact that they have a variety of sauces to dip with, the God sauce was probably my fav followed by the fallen angel. You don't leave this place hungry that's for sure, will gladly be stopping by again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, their sauce is excellent and it's the best customer service I've ever encountered. Always hook it up and if they're ever out of anything they've always made up for it"}
{"text":"My family loved this place the homey atmosphere was great  the food was amazing I ate brisket which I don't like and pulled pork i dont like either but  they were amazing my 14 year old son loved it and he wants to go back as much as we do thanks Mike."}
{"text":"This was a second choice food spot for us today and I'm glad the first spot was filled with a little league team. Walking in I was def put back with how tiny the place was. And was sad there wasn't baked beans..... but DAMN the food was good. I got the pulled pork sandwich which I thought was good but what hit out of the park was the short rib! There was no way to be prepared for this huge melt in your mouth piece of meat!!!! The seasoning was great! I mean it was sooooo tasty!!! The brisket was good too! For sides we had tater tots and Mac n cheese..... we got the opportunity to say hello to beautiful family who owns the place. Only negative for me was that I was sitting right under a vent and was freezing! But that did not take away from the tastiness of the food! Def will go back and suggest that others give it a try too! Hope they expand! Seating is very tight!"}
{"text":"I would consider this a mom n pop or hold in the wall bbq joint. But I would have to say the bbq is on point. Cooked to perfection and tender.  I would recommend the brisket and baby back ribs. All the sauces are homemade and they have a lot to choose from.  Definitely will tell people about it.  It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I had tried to eat at their new Henderson location without luck so when I was near the original location I jumped at the chance.    I called in my order of pick 3 with ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  I wanted to try the sausage but they didn't have it that day.  For sides I picked mac n cheese and baked beans.  I arrived a little after 11 and they were already slammed.  The man I guessed to be Mike was handling everything with ease.  Phone orders, people dining in, communicating with the kitchen.  He did it all while still greeting and chatting with guests.  Great customer service.  After a torturous drive home I dug into some of the best bbq I've had in Vegas.  All the meats were delicious.  Ribs were my favorite.  They need to bottle and sell their sauce.  It's that good.  I was a little disappointed in the sides though.  The mac in cheese didn't have much flavor and the beans tasted like canned pork and beans but with no pork in sight.   Maybe they use that as a base and I got the unfinished version?  Or just an off day?  Whatever the case I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ideal place for authentic BBQ. Tender meat, a variety of flavorful sauces, and great service right when we walked in. Definitely will be back and recommend to any BBQ lover"}
{"text":"Solid good hole in the wall BBQ restaurant. This place is small like 6 or 7 tables small. You order your food at the cash register and they bring it out to you. The BBQ sauce was delicious. I loved the super spicy hot one. The Beef BBQ ribs  were ok nothing great a little too fatty. I loved the Mashed potatoes BBQ brisket bake. It's was delicious and full of flavor. The potatoes were real not instant so that's always a positive. The portions are huge here so come hungry."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from eating their food. Not sure if it was the mac n cheese, the jerk chicken with mashed potatoes, pulled pork, hot links, or spare ribs. The price for it all was chill but then waking up sick wasn't worth it.. stuck in bed until it passed over  Edit: Not only did I get sick but so did my partner. This was the only meal I had that day. So I'm pretty sure it was the food.  Response: super late but ya. I had one meal that whole day. And whatever I ordered wasn't your whole menu lol pump your brakes. And thanks but no thanks, I don't need a refund from your rude ass. Just wanted to let people know the food here gave me the shits and made me throw up for 8 hours straight."}
{"text":"Fabulous BBQ. Addicting sauces. Ribs are so tender. Bbq mashed potatoes are unique. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Like most, I thought the BBQ sauce was terrific.  They are going to be selling it in the bottle soon and definitely would buy it.  The pulled pork was delicious though the portion was a little small.  The other item I had was the chicken and it was two legs.  I like legs but that wasn't what I expected.  If it is only going to be legs, that needs to be stated up front.  I ate there and was pretty disappointed with the facilities.  Like a number of BBQ places, cutlery was plastic.  I don't like that at all!  In their case, it was only a fork.  Jessie said the place was a pick it up with your hands type place so no knives.  I could even handle that if there were either napkins or decent quality paper towels.  There were no napkins and there was a roll of paper on the table that wouldn't soak up water and wasn't perforated.  You just tear off a sheet wherever you can.  If I am eating with my hands, I want more than this.  There were no towelettes either.  I left sticky.  The small eating area itself wasn't clean.  This easily could be a 5 star review but there needs to be improvement in the services.  It is a much better takeout place than eat in."}
{"text":"Hands down the best barbecue spot in Vegas. Their meats are all so tender and flavorful and their sides are addicting. I eat here at least once a week for lunch. I can never get enough of their waffle fries, they're a must have!! Great price, great service, great food."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ. Dope server/owner/host.  Don't listen to the haters on the other reviews. If you want delicious authentic unpretentious BBQ go eat here."}
{"text":"still waiting on coming to this place, I have done nothing but online deliveries, Awesome food and fast delivery"}
{"text":"This place is a classic.  The four of us used the groupon for an awesome meal.  We go to Vegas lots, usually for a few weeks at a time.  Eating at different places is big on our list.  We've been to many over the past few decades.   My 10 year old daughter said after the meal, \"this is the best place in Vegas.\"  I couldn't discount her statement.  The bbq plate we got was lots of good food.  Pulled pork, chicken and sausages were done right.  We also got two sides included.  The mac n cheese was the best.  I loved how they did the mash potatoes.  Still chunky with some peels in there, using quality spuds.  We ordered more sides they were so good.  And drinks included.  Not only was this great food, the value was spot on.  This is a small place.  But we loved the whole time we were there.  The lady running the place was on her own out front, but she knew what she was doing.    I've known for decades the the best places in Vegas are off the strip.  If you're not renting a car and checking these places out, then the best of Vegas is missing you.  We will visit this joint every time we're in town."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge BBQ fan but this is amazing. I had the brisket and pulled pork. It melts in your mouth. The waffle fries were so good. Mac n cheese delicious. Coleslaw good too. Only thing missing was a dessert. Very small place but the order taker was super helpful and nice!! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq. Love the food and the service!! Mike is awesome. :) we got the duke with waffle fries and one with Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I've visited Jessie Rae's a few times now and I feel confident is stating that their food is always awesome! Some of our favorites have been the Belt Buckle with waffle fries and brisket and an extra coating of their God Sauce plus the Two Meat with One Side Combo (I like Brisket and pulled pork plus mac and cheese). Try a corn muffin dripping in butte Portions are always so large, I need to bring some home! Food is served hot, juicy and just delectable!  Sauces are on the table for you to mix or find a favorite! God Sauce is not just a clever name but also created by the Sauce Gods! And the staff... Nifty Lady is super friendly and was quite patient with us on our first visit and Cute Boy was quick to the rescue when part of our order was accidentally incorrect. I will eventually try everything on the menu and I look forward to my upcoming visits to try something new!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Pork was well seasoned and very moist.  Chicken had great flavor and loved the \"God\" sauce.  Off the beaten path but well worth the adventure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love BBQ. We have gone to a few BBQ spots in town. This is by far our favorite now. We ordered their maniac fries with pulled pork and side of beans. So delicious. As my boyfriend would say \"absolutely magical\". We will definitely be going back to try their brisket, and continue going anytime we want BBQ."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to some good BBQ. After eating here, I still am. The brisket was old and over cooked, the \"sausage\" was more like a big hotdog, and to top off the experience they were out of BBQ sauce. Good BBQ is hard to find in Vegas and this place makes it harder."}
{"text":"This.is the best BBQ in Vegas.  The food is incredible, the people are even better.  Everything is awesome.  Literally...order it all!!  Follow them on social media, they offer deals all the time.  But the food is worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq I've ever had. Waited till I went twice to write this review to make sure. I suggest you order the fries and their God sauce is the best bbq sauce I've ever had. The people who work their front are super friendly and attentive. Both times I came here they gave me extra food to try on top of what I ordered. This time it was the beef ribs. YUM. I'm not a religious man.......but these guys are doing gods work."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out. We've been to some other BBQ places but Jesse Rae's is definitely up there. Definitely in my top 3 places to go. We got the High Roller Combo as well as the Maniac fries. The fries were really good, the brisket wasn't dry and and chicken was really good. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Wish I lived in Vegas so I could eat here regularly!! Being from Virginia, we know a little something about Carolina barbecue... And we were BEYOND impressed. Everyone at the table got pulled pork sandwiches and drenched them with the Carolina sauce. I got a combo with brisket and pulled pork. THE BRISKET WAS AMAZING!!! I had to share with everyone at the table. God sauce + their brisket was absolute heaven. Also loved the waffle fries and Mac n cheese. Very helpful, friendly staff. Would recommend to anyone who loves large portions of amazing bbq at a fair price! 10/10"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my boyfriend. The food was really good and large helpings, but the price was slightly high. The 3 stars is due to the bad service. The lady at the register was very abrupt, rude, aggressive and interruptive. I had barely taken my last bite when she reached across the table and took our food, while asking if we were finished. I would have given this place a higher rating if it wasn't for the customer service."}
{"text":"Was there about a week ago, saw the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try, and I'm glad we did! Was a little sketchy at first because it's inside the bar, it has its own section. But the food is so good! Better than the other bbq places in town! I love how the meat is on top of the Mac and cheese and all mixed in with the sauce! Every bite is so good and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Come stop by Jessie Rae's BBQ and give Las Vegas style BBQ a try. You won't be disappointed! For years I've been searching for that one BBQ joint to brag about and say \"I've got the perfect place we can go.\"  That place is Jessie Rae's BBQ. You'll find yourself coming back for a regular fix.   I had the Jessie Rae pulled pork sandwich! It hit the spot and although I was full, it left me wanting more.   The owners make everyone feel like a VIP. They are also very personable and friendly. Save your receipt and get 10% off your next visit. Also, include your email at checkout and receive a coupon once a month!   They also cater! In addition to their store, you can find them at the local farmers market in Thursday's at the gardens park located off of 215 and town center."}
{"text":"Yet again Jessie Rae's BBQ does it again!  I called this location for 6 catering trays for a birthday party to feed 6 people. I only gave them 2 hours notice and they were able to pull it off. I ordered a tray of each of the following: brisket, ribs, hot links, mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese, and corn. As usual, the brisket and ribs were so tender and juicy! This time was a special treat because we were able to get our hands on some hot links.  Every time we've gone before they're always sold out.  These hot links were the best I've ever had. They contain just the right amount of spice and melt in your mouth. All the sides were fantastic and really tied the meal together. When I crave BBQ, Jessie Rae's is the only place I go to get my fix."}
{"text":"I first tried Jessie Rae's BBQ when they catered an event at my workplace. The food was fantastic! I've never been a huge BBQ fan in Las Vegas because it's usually the same stuff that never sticks out from the rest. Very different with Jessie's BBQ though! Everything was delicious! The food was hot & fresh. I can't wait to have it again. I might actually cater my next BBQ instead of grilling! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Badass bbq packed into a tiny little space. I had the brisket and the pulled pork. Brisket was pretty good but the pulled pork was fantastic. Wife had Mac and cheese loaded with pulled pork which she loved. Their \"fallen angel\" reaper sauce is super flavorful and packs a punch but the heat doesn't overpower the flavor. The \"god sauce\" was just no BS bbq sauce, super tasty.  Owner is straightforward and blunt while still being polite, which is refreshing in today's world of being scared of words. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tell them \"Wayne sent you\" to get 10% off your order. WAR Now....the Wayne Allyn Root Show Mon-Fri 3-6pm on 790AM."}
{"text":"First Time & Definitely not the last!! Recommended by a friend and we will be doing the same . Cute, Small place but very welcoming. Hubby & I had the Maniac Fries (Large) for the two and it was just the perfect size. Nom Nom Nom !!!"}
{"text":"I was craving some barbecue.  And. This place. Had the just what i was craving. They had a big menu.  The food has  a great taste. Ill be coming back.  Next time we come to vegas...."}
{"text":"OMG!!  The absolute BEST barbeque in Vegas, hell, anywhere. The chicken and brisket were to die for and the sides were equally delicious!  Oh, and did I mention the sauces. The sauces alone are worth the visit. So, so good!!  Great environment, very homey feel and Samantha provided us with great customer service. We. Will. Be. Back...soon. This is our new favorite place. Betta get some!!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooooo good. Literally just started eating it and had to write a review immediately because it is hands down one of the best bbq places In the valley. Got the duke waffle fries and a 2 meat combo with Mac n cheese. The pork has such a good flavor to it, not too smokey and sauce was a perfect match. The mac n cheese is probably some of the best Mac n cheese I've ever had. My kid got the small waffle fries and seriously devoured them in five seconds because they were so damn good. Definitely will be back. Owner and staff are super friendly and helpful as well. Thanks guys, derrricccioussss!"}
{"text":"Great place. I am from North  Carolina  and this is best BBQ I have found in Las Vegas. Small place but big value. Would have gave five stars if place was bigger,which I am sure they will be as they grow."}
{"text":"There's good and not so good.   The good: 1) fast and friendly service; 2) very tasty and perfectly done pork.    Problems: 1) Not worth the $17 I paid for my sandwich and sides.  Way overpriced.  2) kinda tasteless bread / bun which didn't add to the experience.   The BBQ sauces were good.  No issues there."}
{"text":"Wow is what I have to say! Best bbq I made have ever had. The homemade sauces are to die for. Wish I didn't have to fly four hours to get there or I would go there all the time. If you live near Vegas or visiting take the time to check it out. You will not be disappointed. I will go there every time I'm out from now on!"}
{"text":"Great place owner was very friendly! We will definitely be back, two huge platers of food, you won't finish it all but be prepared to take some home. It's a small place so be sure to come at an off time or order pick up!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this jewel by accident. The ribs were tender and melt in your mouth luscious , and the homemade god sauce was best bbq sauce EVER!!! This was our best meal during our stay in Vegas. We hope to come back to Vegas soon just to eat there again! Samantha the hostess greeted us with a smile, took our order, the meal came out amazingly fast and we loved every bite. Highly recommend this cute little place to anyone and everyone!  Carla S from Michigan"}
{"text":"really loved the sandwich,  great portion and quality meat, not some thin sliced that I was expecting,   it's small, only four tables,  very homey atmosphere, totally and pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Group of 4 from Miami in the mood for BBQ! Just had a great meal at Jessie Rae. Best BBQ ever! Everything thing is great. Must try spare ribs, baby back ribs, brisket and rib tips. Sweet corn, Mac n cheese and baked beans are a must.  They also have 4 special home made sauces, all ate great. If your visiting this area a MUST try. Samantha treated us like family."}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas and found this place on Yelp.  Even with the good reviews I was a bit skeptical, but the reviews were right - this place is good. The people are awesome and the food was delicious. If you want some good BBQ in Vegas, it's here."}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING. Talk about a happy tummy! The price point are good and super affordable for such flavor and so much of the food in a serving!!!  Better than Rollin' Smoke ;)"}
{"text":"Whether it's brisket or fillet special, It still puts a smile on your face. From the corn with smoke butter or even the fresh mac & cheese you'll be a happy camper. Thanks to Mike's hard work, & dedication you could definitely taste the love behind it! Well done Jessie Rae's! Until next time!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this food here, fantastic prices and the amount of food is huge. Fantastic staff and very friendly."}
{"text":"Good authentic falling meat off the bones bbq and tender  meats.  Fair pricing for what you get and i always feel bbq has to carry a more premium price than just fast food.  My only suggestion for the meat combo is that it should come with two sides, i like trying the other sides on the menu without paying too much extra.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall bbq place with kind service. Ordered the sampler platter which was on point. Must try for all. See for yourself."}
{"text":"So leaving work the other night I was in the mood for some BBQ. A quick Yelp review showed this place was on my way home.  It's a small place in a business district. The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.  After perusing their menu I decided to order a full slab of beef ribs, a order of mac and cheese and two orders of coleslaw. With a tip it came to $53  I wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.  We found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.  Neither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.  The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!  So would I stop here again. Perhaps, but I think I'd try something different.   And bottles or cans of soda would be great so you wouldn't have to stop somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came in for our first time last week and it was DELICIOUS! I had the Jessie Rae Burger and it was immaculate, I absolutely love their home style cooking. The BBQ/Hot sauces were bomb! Fallen Angel was by far the best BBQ with the right amount of heat, so we went on to buy a bottle for the house. (We now use it on pretty much everything) After trying the cornbread, me and our one year old son were all about it! I had asked to purchase another one for my son when we were on our way out the door, but the man at the counter handed me one on the house for our little man. He really loves the cornbread and I can't wait to come back for our next visit! Thanks for the hospitality you guys, great food and great service"}
{"text":"I am amazed at how many good BBQ places there are in Vegas.  I lived in San Diego for over 27 years and honestly there was only a couple of decent BBQ places and both of them closed down.  One thing for sure this town is a Foodies paradise!  Jessie Rae's had been on my radar for some time and I finally made it to them.  We ordered to go which was a good idea as I noted how small the inside is when we walked in.  Glad I got my order to go as eating BBQ you need some space to spread out.       We got the brisket, ribs and sausage.  The brisket was in long pieces and moist, tender and smoky flavored.  This is real BBQ not the grilling BS some places call BBQ.  The sausage was slightly spicy and oh so delicious.  The ribs which were the wife's choice were fall off the bone tender and really tasty.  They have some unique sauces - we tried the sweet Carolina style and the spicy vinegar based sauce.   Both were very tasty and went well with all the meats.  The side dish we all got was the Cole Slaw and it was really good.  More of a sweet vinegar taste and not the mayo heavy type I have tried at other restaurants.       The service was good and the guy running the register was friendly and helpful despite being pretty busy.  Since it was our first time it took us a few mins to take in the menu.  He was helpful and gave us some great suggestions on items to order.  Looking forward to my next visit as this is a great spot serving up some REAL BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a 5 star but haven't had the ribs yet but the pulled pork Sammy was so good and the potato salad is so yummy I can't wait to go back - once I have the ribs I'm sure my stars will change to 5"}
{"text":"I had the 3 meat combo,  pulled pork, sliced brisket and ribs with slaw!!!!  Awesome!!  You know it's good BBQ when you don't have to add sauce !!!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome restaurant! Only four seats, so scope that parking lot. Always busy, so when you see its not, definitely pull on in! BBQ at its best. I just ordered their Maniac Tots. A bed of tater tots topped with mac n cheese topped with brisket and sausage. They dish it up, sauce it and serve you this magical dish. The tase is nothing short of incredible. Their meat combos are delicious and generous in size. The service is top notch as well. Hopefully they grow and get a bigger dining room. This is just awesome!"}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich and fries. Meat absolutely tender and seasoned well. Great customer service. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking genuine food that is locally owned and operated."}
{"text":"Don't go!! It was so dirty, flies everywhere and no soap in the bathroom. We just left and I'm hoping I don't end up with food poisoning. Pulled pork was fatty, chicken was okay, brisket was decent (but not great), but none were hot when served and the sides we ordered (Mac and cheese, bbq mashed potatoes, waffle fries, corn and baked beans) were mediocre at best. Unless you want to roll the dice on food poisoning and spend your whole meal swatting away flies, I would not recommend. Staff was very nice, but I will never go back."}
{"text":"On Friday, i had a hankering for some BBQ.  So i phoned by buddy LJ and decided to meet for lunch at 1130 to beat the lunch crowd.  This place is tiny!!!  When you say hole in the wall, i think it is smaller than a hole in the wall.  it is kind of like a crack in the wall.  You can fit 8 diners comfortably in here.    In total, 6 of us went to lunch together.  When we walked in, the place was empty.  In typical ME fashion, i wanted to try a little bit of everything.  So i went for the 3 meat combo which included a side.  Thanks to my YELP check-in, I was given a second side and kool aid for free!!!  The 3 meats i got were ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Sides were mac n cheese and green beans w/ pork belly.  My meal came out to $18.  This is a lot cheaper than other BBQ joints around town.    Here comes my food.  Initial reaction was WOW that is a big portion!!  3 pork ribs, 3 large slices of brisket, and a nice scoop of pulled pork.  Portion wise, you definitely get more than what you paid for.  Now the all important part... the taste.  I dug into the sides first.  Green beans were good.  And little pieces of pork belly make any dish better.  Not sure if I would get this again, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The mac n cheese was a bummer.  Wasn't as tasty as I hoped it would be.  My complaint about both sides would be that they were both a bit bland and lacked seasoning and kick.  Mac n cheese was my least favorite item.  Next, i dug into the brisket.  Thick and juicy brisket slices got my mouth watering.  This brisket was very good.  Best brisket in town in my opinion.  Next came the pulled pork.  This fatty, smokey, juicy mound of deliciousness was delightful.  This is some very tasty pulled pork.  Last, the ribs.  the smoke ring, juiciness, tenderness, flavor... everything about these ribs made me say these are without a doubt my FAVORITE ribs in town!!  Hands down #1 no doubt about it.    I've been reading about everyone raving about this God sauce.  Well, I don't know about this God sauce, but Fallen Angel is my new favorite BBQ sauce.  I drowned my food in Fallen Angel and it was so good.  This sauce will slap you in the face and let you know its there.  So spicy and flavorful.  I could probably drink a cup of it, its that good!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first (and definitely not my last) visit!!  The food is excellent. The meat on the baby back ribs melted off the bone. The BBQ chicken nachos are to die for!!! The special Alabama sauce that is on the is very good. The staff is very courteous. Even one of the chefs came out to see us."}
{"text":"Friendly and awesome people! BBQ is one of the best I've had in a while! Sauces is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Thank You For Having the 50% off today on Valentines Day. It's also my first time trying your   Jessie Rae's BBQ Sandwich.   The Fallen Angel Sauce Amazing, I'm still sweating from the sauce."}
{"text":"Let me start with the good: customer service was really good. I got exactly what I ordered. It was delivered incredibly fast at dinner time. The prices were very reasonable.  However, this was not good BBQ. I ordered brisket and pulled pork. It did not taste like it was smoked or slow cooked or anything like that. The brisket was dry, the pork needed more time in the smoker.  Maybe it's supposed to be this way in Vegas? If so, count me out. I would not recommend this place if you've ever had good BBQ before."}
{"text":"A Groupon was used for a nice and smoky BBQ lunch. Jessie Rae's a small place with five tables indoors and one table outside. The menu is posted on the wall. Orders are placed at the counter and delivered to your table. A small variety of sodas are available in the self serve refrigerator. Plastic is used for the utensils and plate. The wait time for the food was short. This seems to be a one person operation as the same person worked the counter, filled the order in the kitchen and delivered it to the table.   My order consisted of 2 meats and one side. I chose the spare ribs, pulled pork and green bean casserole. The ribs were meaty and tender with a deep smoke ring. The pulled pork was tender and smoky. However there was too much fat . I prefer much leaner pork. Sauce is not required but the God sauce is delicious and kicks up the flavor. Definitely try it. I recommend the green beans which were great with a nice crunch from the fried onions on top."}
{"text":"Went here late Friday and unfortunately they were closing.  They had run out of BBQ.  The owner Mike? was out back when I pulled up and I asked him if this was the BBQ place and he said it was.  He said they had some chicken but I had wanted some pork or beef ribs.  He said they had one beef short rib left and said I can have it for $4.  I said sure because I was really looking forward to BBQ.  I had a bite and it was delicious.  Had to give the meat a little tug but it came clean off the bone. He gave it to me in a Styrofoam box so I did not see the inside of his place.  He was very friendly and also gave me a bunch of paper towels.    I asked him what kind of smoke he uses and he said he used peach, maple, and something else I don't remember but he said he will change it up daily, weekly,... depending on what he has.  I was thinking when he said that, that he should really just stick to 1 combo, since it imparts flavor to the BBQ and the BBQ will taste different if you use different wood.  My 1 suggestion to him is if he has to change his wood (keep you minds out of the gutter) maybe stick to certain woods on specific days, that way if you try it and you like a specific type of smoke flavor you can always come back the next week for the same BBQ.  Otherwise if the smoke flavor is good one time and is not to your liking another time it would be a hit or miss if you get the same BBQ, but if you used the same wood on specific days then people would come back on that day knowing it would be good to their liking.    Unfortunately, I do not live in Vegas otherwise I would go back earlier and really try it out.  He also said to me if I called prior to my coming and it would be late again he would make sure he would have what I had ordered.  Which when I think about it I would hope so if I ordered it before hand.  lol.  He was a very nice guy and I will definitely go back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ahhh-mazing! My husband and I were in the mood for something new, as we browsed Uber eats and decided on Jessie Rae's. The food was nothing short of perfection. The meat had such depths of flavor. We have eaten BBQ all over the country and this is the best we've had. Texas and St. Louis, some of the giants Barbecue culinary giants have been underwhelming compared to what we experienced tonight. Thankful this place is in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Everyone's food was super delicious, service was great, Dexter's Laboratory was on the TV. What more can I say? Def want to eat here again soon~"}
{"text":"I had to upgrade the star count to 5 stars, because now Im convinced the maniac fries are drizzled w/liquid crack cocaine on top... OMG these maniac fries are the life of my stomach right now. Im convinced Jesus spit in the BBQ sauce, and thats why the Gods sauce is the greatest BBQ sauce Ive ever had. Shoutout everybody at Jessie Rae's!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Huge portions. Very good service. Get there early there aren't very many tables.  Cant praise enough. Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight with my family, and was very impressed with food. It is hard to judge/rate BBQ as there are so many different styles depending on where you are from. This is a very unique, Las Vegas style BBQ - and I think they have successfully captured the essence of several BBQ types in their menu. We tried a few things on the menu, pulled pork and brisket were my favorite, but the other meats were really good as well. They offer 3 sauces, but also have a couple others on demand if you are looking for more variety. This is also not a chain/franchise, the owner cooks all the food himself, which is very impressive and hard to come across, so you know it's great quality and made with passion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I ordered the Duke (brisket over tater tots) and let me tell you it was amazing! I added God Sauce to it and it is a combination of Alabama, Memphis, and KC rolled into one I believe. I ended up ordering a bottle of God Sauce to go, it was so good! They have only been open for about a year and a half but have been voted the best BBQ in Vegas the last 2 years. The restaurant has 3 tables inside and the location is off the beaten path, but to me those are the things that make it great. I will definitely be back and I see this as a restaurant that will continue to grow!"}
{"text":"This review is for their food, service, and catering.  First of all the food was 15 minutes late. May not seem like a lot of time. But when your business meeting starts and there is no food to serve it's a total embarrassment. Unacceptable.  Second, the delivery driver dropped the food that was in bags on the counter and bolted out the door. He didn't say 1 word to me or the others in the room. I was confused because I thought he was coming back. But he never did. Unacceptable.  Third, I began unpacking the food from the bags. First bag was a 7 ft long roll of brown paper towels. I guess they don't give you napkins when order their BBQ. They just pull the handle on the roll of brown bathroom paper towels. Unacceptable.  Fourth, they packed the food in Styrofoam containers. Not aluminum trays. I thought this was weird. Never have I ordered catering and gotten Styrofoam containers that you typically get when you get a doggie bag at the actual restaurant. Unacceptable and very unprofessional.  Fifth, the food was all crushed from being in Styrofoam containers. Baked beans were literally spilling out the edges and onto the bag and counter. The mac n cheese also was mostly in the bag and not the container. Unacceptable.  Lastly, the food was just not that good and my business associates were extremely disappointed in the overall presentation and service provided. The last straw was the bbq sauce. They literally gave me approximately 10oz of bbq sauce for 10-12 ppl. It wasn't enough for everyone to get some. So some people got dry unflavored meat. Unacceptable.  Please use caution when ordering from this restaurant.  EDIT:  Here is the response from the owner. Great customer service...no apology, no trying to make it right. Just blaming it on the customer. Nice work guys...nice work.   5/27/2017  First this review is because you didn't get to eat because you though the food had glouton in it and it didn't and I told the stooge you had call me that.  I would have resolved the other issue them. So let's break this down  15 minutes late. I am sorry. Give us more notice before larger catering and we will be more prepared. We did our best with the time given.  We are slow smoked bbq not McDonald's a   We have an option for set up if you want it.  It's was not ordered.  You ordered. Just delivery.  That's what you got.   Those rolls are not from the bathroom. We use them on our tables like most bbq restaurants do  Sorry you thought something was weird. It's what we do and never have had an issue.  An opinion like this is hardly basis for a review   We are very sorry for it spilling.  Never have had it happen but you use the word literally a lot.    For your next point saying literally approximately 10 oz.  sauce is an ordered item. You didn't order any so I gave you some trying to be nice   You meat also had sauce on it. So nothing was dry and I flavorful.   Again all issues I would have handled with your guy who called.  All which weren't not brought up."}
{"text":"Accidental find for us as we were driving through Las Vegas- we LOVED it!! The Belt Buckle on Mac & Cheese with the God Sauce was Amazing!! Beef was very tender - melts in your mouth :)"}
{"text":"This is authentic bbq. We came on a great groupon deal and they give you what you pay for in the amount of food. There's 5 different sauces you can put on the food and I loved every last one. We will definitely be back for more and to try the ribs!"}
{"text":"please stop by jessie rae bbq i promise you be satisfied. i order the maniac frys witch is a must."}

{"text":"Thank you to Mike n his team for their awesome service and amazing food.  Brisket n Ribs jus melts in your mouth.  His corn has a flavor that is out of this world.  I'm eating here again and again with new peeps..onolicious..."}
{"text":"Food is great! I ordered the Duke, thinking it was a sandwich but it's not. Still very tender meat and tastes amazing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the menu is a little overwhelming. Hence the reason I thought I ordered a sandwich and did not. Overall great place for a quick bite. Very fast service."}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ in vegas!  The Duke fries are absolutely AMAZING and don't forget about The God's Sauce!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great and so is the staff. definitely a must for fans of good BBQ."}
{"text":"Been going here for awhile now and hands down the best BBQ I've had! The brisket and spare ribs is what I always get"}
{"text":"\"I don't think we had an order messed up and I was this happy with it.\"  New neighborhood, tired from work, decided to see what was on GrubHub. BBQ sounded good, so we ordered two 2 meat combos. We got an extra order of chicken but the pork beans we ordered were missing. Disappointing, but the food was so delicious it was like whatever, and I quote: \"Now we have an excuse to go in and try it!\" Best pulled pork I've ever had, amazing brisket, and the ribs are nuts. They also forgot the sauce, so that's another thing to come in for."}
{"text":"Some of the best barbecue I've ever had.  Brisket, tri-tip, ribs, pulled pork--and always generous portions."}
{"text":"Went to Jessie Rae's  last night. The food was ok. I tend to like my BBQ with more smoke than what we experienced. The ribs, pork & sauces we good. Did not care for the sausages. The lady that greeted was was friendly. I have yet to find great BBQ in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in drove from summerlin for lunch because  someone recommend we try their BBQ....I must say it was super good...the sauce is amazing...my husband  ordered a sandwich  (Jessie  Rae special) & I ordered pulled pork with waffle  fries...I forget the name of my meal...but it was certainly delish...my review  is based on the food alone...the restaurant  part needs a lot of tidying up, especially the floor. But it's run by guys so as us women know they don't clean or pick up anything. You can always order to go..."}
{"text":"Do not order from this place. I placed an order for delivery for s 2 meat combo with chopped brisket & pulled pork and waffle fries and a 6 oz of their \"god sauce\" . When my food was delivered, the bag was all oily and dirty and so was the box the food came in. My order was all incorrect.   They put tater tots instead of waffle fries  I paid $3 extra for sauce and they literally put one little 1oz of sauce   The meat was disgusting looking. The meat was soggy and had water all in the plate.   Total rip off and horrible customer service when I called and complained .    I wish I had pictures of the food but I was so pissed off that as soon as I Saw my order was incorrect I threw it in the trash    Why would I want to get another meal free on the house if this meal turned out this bad ? And here is my receipt of me clearly asking for waffles fries, not Tater tots . I also called in 30 seconds before asking if you guys had waffles fries or ran out. The worker said yes we do have waffle fries."}
{"text":"Can't even begin to describe how great the food is here. We got the Clever Chicken over waffle fries & the Jessie Rae's Pulled Pork sandwich. Every single sauce is delicious and everything tasted so good. My favorites are the Vegas sauce and the God sauce. Prices are great for the portions too. Will definitely be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. The food is delicious. I would recommend looking at the menu before ordering. The only two negative things that I have to say is the mother-in-law that answers the phone could be a lot more customer friendly and when they package things to be delivered that they take time to make sure that nothing is going to spill. I highly recommend the house barbecue sauce, our family doesn't care for the pigs sweat sauce. The Angel sauces pretty delicious. The beans are tasty and the corn is perfectly cooked. I've tried everything on the menu and have had them cater a couple company events. We really like the owner and the way that he's taking care of us."}
{"text":"Love Jessie Rae's BBQ!! The Duke fries are amazing and so is the God sauce!!! The owner is very nice and trust when you read other reviews they do run out of certain items everyday!! I will definitely be coming back and bringing a ton of people to try Jessie Rae's."}
{"text":"Wow o wow this place was excellent. Got the 3 meat combo with corn. Tried the Ribs, Brisket and pulled pork. All the meats where tender and flavorful. Plus I smothered the famous sauce on everything. Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"3 of us came in and had to try the pulled pork sandwiches that we saw pictures of. The pork was tender, moist, and full of flavor. There was just the right amount of homemade slaw on top to add a great freshness and texture to the sandwich. God sauce....unbelievable, a must try. I added a little of the Carolina vinegar bbq sauce too for just the right amount of tang. Dont pass this place u!. I hear they do a lot of catering too. Ill keep that in mind for my next event. Keep it up Mike!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My first time here and didn't know what to expect. But I will definitely be back for more BBQ."}
{"text":"NEG'S:  *Extremely limited seating: Probably total for 12-14. *Seating outside looks like furniture from the side of the road  *Dirty floors, dirty plates(bowls)  * mac and cheese tasted like craft  * food cold    Positives:  * great sauces  * trip tip good  * link good  * waffle fries good  *baked beans good"}
{"text":"This was the second place I had gone to after seeing it on the news and to me it wasn't that great. My family seemed to think it was ok, but for me I've had better. The sauces were probably the best part of the place. The staff was really nice too. Oh and the apple cobbler was pretty good."}
{"text":"Fantastic pulled pork sandwich and ribs. This hidden little gem is worth a visit if you're looking to get away from the standard tourist garbage being served up on the Strip."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with a friend for lunch. When I first walked in there wasn't any where to sit. Inside it is small and there aren't very many tables, but by the time we ordered our food there was a table that opened up. They have expanded some, so there's at least more places to sit than before. Hole in the wall bbq is the best way I can describe Jessie Rae's after walking inside and honestly I wouldn't want any less. Inside was clean and there were different bbq sauces on the table all of which were good. I recently came by with a group of friends for dinner and they were giving half off the entire menu (just for that evening) to celebrate their Best of Las Vegas win. Nice!   Three Meat Combo ($19.99) - Pick 3 meats or triple up on your favorite. This combo includes one side. The pulled pork has been inconsistent when I've visited as far as flavor, texture and look. The hot links are tasty with a nice kick of flavor. It's the brisket though that shines. Tender, juicy and flavorful brisket can be chopped per your request should you like.  Jive Chicken ($8.75 regular size) - Waffles fries piled with smoked hand-pulled chicken? Sign me up! The waffle fries had just the right crispness and held up all the toppings well. The chicken had a great flavor and was well l liked by others in my group also.   The Belt Buckle ($11.25 regular size) - This is like the Jive Chicken, but we asked for tater tots instead of waffle fries on this one. The tater tots were crispy, tasty gems. The brisket was piled high they did not skimp. The tots really did well holding up the juicy brisket. This with either the tots or waffle fries would be a great thing for a group to share and they have a larger size also.   Corn with Smoked Butter ($2.75) - This sounded better than it was. The corn wasn't bad, but it honestly tasted like corn from a can that was heated up in butter.   BBQ Beans ($2.75) - I ate every bite of these beans the first visit and did the very same on the next. They drizzle a bit of bbq sauce on the top of the beans and I could have eaten another side because these beans oh my they were so good!   Mac and Cheese ($2.75) - The first time I came the mac and cheese was very good. This last visit the mac n cheese wasn't at all the same taste or texture. I'd have rather doubled up on beans! Maybe it was just an off night for the mac and cheese since they were so busy, so I won't rule it out again in the future.   They have a variety of sandwiches on the menu and mini cobbler for dessert. There's a private parking lot, but when it gets busy cars park on the street at the side of the building."}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas Texas and when it comes to BBQ I'm very picky and I have to say it feel like home here . The food here is amazing my personal favorite are the tacos. The people that work put a lot of love in to there food and they work extra hard to make you feel welcome. It's not the biggest or the fanciest BBQ spot but it's best when it comes to BBQ and customer service. This is definitely my favorite spot for BBQ."}
{"text":"Just ordered from flaky Rae's through postmates worst mistake ! Do not order from these people delivery and always call ahead if your going to eat in because they don't have half of what's on their menu! I just spent 20 bucks on what was supposed to be beef ribs, brisket, Mac&cheese and beans they didn't have beef ribs so I happily accepted pork ribs but is that what I get NO! I get pulled pork and brisket they charged me for everything then I see I don't even have my beans! I had to call and tell them I didn't receive my beans can my post mates driver come back thank god he was even willing to and it was only then they told me they didn't have beans either and offered a refund for my beans but my question is what would of happen if I didn't call! Would you have just taken my money for my beans? Seems petty for just a $2.00 side but it's the principle!! and at the end of it all the food is mediocre that's what I get for cheating on rolling smoke so upset. Smh do better business guys!   Update:   it was the not the wrong meal that was sent the owner claimed that postmates switches my beef rib to pork so that's why I got that but if that was the case why did my postmates driver call me to tell me that there was no beef ribs and I have to call you guys to switch to pork ribs? Because obviously that's what I ordered!! .... at the end of the day the order was wrong I received no refund and the meat was not good tasted like it was probably something that was returned, heated back up and gave to me and the macaroni I don't even understand how but it tasted nothing like macaroni more like green beans I swear idk if you guys are using some kind of box macaroni then just heating it up over and over again but that was just gross and I suggest you use real food cause that couldn't of been. Lastly if the food was still good but the service was just bad I'll be honest and say but this was sadly not the case for this place bad food and service."}
{"text":"Great and quick Service! Friendly gentleman at the front who I assume is the owner. Food was incredible! I got the belt buckle which is your choice of bottom-fries, tots, Mac and a few others and brisket on top! I chose the waffle fries! Variety of bbq sauces and all were to die for! I'll definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu and telling everyone about it!!!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ and smoked food here. Having lived in the Carolinas it was hard to find a good BBQ place in Las Vegas and finally we found it.  This is a very small place with about 4-5 tables and about 15 seatings. It's good for take outs.  I love their Maniac fries and I have to say their Pig Sweat Sauce is the best Carolina sauce I have had in Vegas . The other 2 sauces are Fallen Angel and God Sauce.  We also had pulled pork, ribs and cole slaw. The pork was close to the best I have ever had. It was really tender with a great flavor.  My boyfriend had mentioned about coming here the first time and talked to the owner. He said he was really nice and wanted to go back as he loved the food. This time he wasn't there but the girl at the counter was very nice."}
{"text":"So, let me start by saying that I'm sort of a BBQ fanatic.  Understanding that BBQ can mean a lot of different things to different people based on regional preferences, let me offer up that I pray at the altar of Central Texas Q, such as brisket from Kreuz's and Franklins, and being from LA, having grown up on Philips BBQ, Phils in San Diego and Hogly Wogly in the SFV.    That being said, with expectations sort of low, I was absolutely blown away by the incredible BBQ brisket and ribs at Jessie Rae's and the clear passion that their team had for making great authentic BBQ.    There have been a number of BBQ restaurants opening up in recent months, and honestly, I had high hopes for one in particular that NAILED the atmosphere of a Central Texas joint, but was just slightly above average when it came to the food.  Jessie Rae's is the only one that has me excited to come back.  We had ribs and brisket.  Tony was beyond helpful in taking care of us and even asking whether we wanted brisket from the flat or the point and explaining the differences to make sure we got what we wanted in that fine balance between lean and marbled cuts.  The brisket had a beautiful red-purple smoke ring and a great flavor.  As for the ribs, we were amazed at how the bones practically fell out of the ribs for being as tender as they were, and were incredibly tasty with a great smoky crust.    For what it's worth, prices were also incredibly fair and noticeably cheaper than their local peer group.    The shame is the locale-- it's almost like they're \"hiding out\" in Cactus Jacks and so my review comes with the hope that you'll take a chance and search them out.  This place needs word of mouth but if you are truly appreciative of sublime BBQ, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the city!!! Voted Best in BBQ in the Review Journal .You gotta try the 'God Sauce'! Mike (owner and cook) was blessed with the  skills with a smoker. Come on down locals, this place makes LV proud!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and so glad I did! This is THE best bbq I've had in a really long time. Great food and awesome service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's BBQ is practically a small shack just off the 15 near Russell, but they have a ton of meat. Coming in on Veteran's Day since the place is only up from the morning til 4 on the weekdays, I wasn't surprised to find out they had run out of a number of meats.  I did get to try the brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips, but I really did want to try some baby back and beef ribs (the latter of which is not available every day). Confusing as it is, they are also open on alternating Saturdays. The BBQ I did get to try was quite good. The quality of the brisket stood out, as well as the taste of the rib tips. Pulled pork works well with their sauces, which is really the highlight of Jessie Rae's. The God Sauce, ironically, is my least favorite because it is quite sweet. I enjoyed the hot sauce and the vinegar heavy sauces much more. They were probably the tastiest BBQ sauces I've ever had.  The sides were just okay for me here. Because someone hadn't picked up their order, I got to try some green bean casserole, waffle fries, and corn. I had expected corn on the cob but got some corn in clarified butter instead which came out a little too heavy. The green bean casserole was okay but the waffle fries were probably the best, but nothing particularly special.  Service here is friendly and being a small joint makes it have some of that charm that gets lost at big BBQ place. I definitely hope I can come by and get some baby back and beef ribs sometime soon."}
{"text":"Being a barbeque snob in Las Vegas is not all swine and charcoals's, believe you me.   It's hard enough having to keep a stash of napkins with you just about everywhere you go, but trying to explain that the spot of sauce on your lapel came from another disappointing attempt at barbeque in this town is about as heartbreaking as it gets. Somedays, I wish I could just go back home to Texas.   Jesse Rae's is not one of those barbeque places. In fact, the meat is pretty damn good. With a few exceptions on some of Mike's selections of sides, Jesse Rae's is damn good 'cue. The Fallen Angel sauce is my favorite (despite being a Carolina sauce), but the ribs are awesome without any sauce at all.  We catered in from Jesse Rae's for about 70 people a few weeks back and I have to say Mike did a bang up job. Certainly some of the best smoked meats you will find in the valley, and if Mike keeps perfecting his technique, he is not far from  being as good as you'll find anywhere in Texas.  Keep up the good work Mike, and thanks again for making our event a great success. Everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Gluton. I am a gluten for punishment.   Ordered the High Roller 2 meat combo for 2 people, and the Cesar Salad via Eat 24 for delivery. Got the beef and pork ribs as my meats. For starters, no utensils, no bbq sauce, no salad dressing, and no napkins. Although I asked in the comment section for all but the utensils and napkins. (thought they would be automatic). First Pork Rib I pull out of the box actually great. All down hill from there, ever other piece was burnt beyond recognition, Same for the Beef Ribs, burnt beyond recognition. (See pics). This was borderline Jerky. Cesar Salad, was shredded cabbage with croutons and yellow and white cheese. No dressing. Who the heck makes a shredded cabbage Cesar Salad? This place might win awards for thier cherry picked items cooked to perfection for judges, but the day to day fare has no quality control and just generally sucks. To add insult to injury, smoked butter on the corn adorned all the the boxes and the bag. See pics for validation if I can upload them. ."}
{"text":"In the mood for some BBQ and wanted to try a new place. After looking at some IG pics Jessie Rae's BBQ was a must visit  Inside of Cactus Jacks we entered and seated ourselves. There was only one person working the dining area and the kitchen. It wasn't very busy so it wasn't that bad service wise. Having looked over the menu I decided to go with the 2 meat combo, brisket(sliced) and ribs with baked beans as a side. I ordered the mac and cheese as an extra.  Brisket was the star of the show. We were told it would be longer than normal for the brisket since it was still in the smoker. We opted to wait and it was well worth it. Some of the most tender brisket I ever had, definitely melted in your mouth  Ribs were very good as well. Plenty of meat on the bone and were done to perfection.  Sides were basic and nothing fancy. They beans were tasty and would order them again. the mac and cheese was not good at all. Not cheesy enough and the pasta was overcooked, maybe these sat around to long?   Service was on point for someone running around the whole salon taking and serving food, possibly even doing all the work in the kitchen as well. Due to our loner wait we were given extra meet, much appreciated!"}
{"text":"If this place has won best in Vegas BBQ, that's a sad state of affairs for the Vegas BBQ scene.   We Ordered the chicken plate with Mac n Cheese and corn. A 2 meat combo brisket and ribs Mac n cheese. And the Maniac appetizer. $50  The place was filthy. No one cleans here. I'd hate to see the kitchen if that's how they leave the dining area. Not to mention the girl with the dope cough, at the register handling food with her bare hands.   The brisket wasn't done, it's was more than likely pulled too early. Has the texture of a med rare steak.   The chicken is chopped thighs that had the consistency of rubber.   The ribs were fantastic especially with the Ghost pepper bbq sauce.   The maniac was also delicious. Waffle fries with Mac n cheese and pulled pork and hot link.   All in all this place has the potential to be great but is poorly managed.  To answer the owners question we were there at 545 pm on Friday 5-25-18.  The girl at the register was filling Togo containers from a larger container, at the register. And her over all attitude sucked.   Quite the wholesale price difference between brisket and tri tip, yea??   Best of luck to you."}
{"text":"Open today, New  Years Day!!! Excellent barbecue and very friendly service.  Definitely a must stop place for lunch."}
{"text":"Growing up in Georgia, j know a thing or two about good BBQ and BBQ restaurants. It's so hard to find decently priced good BBQ in Vegas and I stopped eating Rollin' Smoke once they sold out to Pawn Stars and raised their prices. I was super excited to try Jessie Rae's after driving by it on my way to work and  decided to eat here yesterday, 11/15/17, for the first time and it will probably be my last. It was the lunch rush so it was crowded and considering how small the place is, this was handled pretty well. What I didn't appreciate was my food. I ordered the maniac fries which, as the menu says, are fries covered in mac and cheese, brisket, hot link, and bama sauce. I was charged a .75 up charge for the brisket, even though it was included with the item, and then I had to remove about 70% of the brisket as it wasn't meat, it was fat. It was a disgusting amount of fat that I tried to all keep contained to the wrapper my corn muffins came in, but it quickly spread outside of that radius and at it's peak, it was taller than the plate my food came in. I was there with a rather large group and the other person in my group who had brisket said he had the same problem, just not as severe as me. It was absolutely disgusting and over the top greasy food. I would steer clear of this \"award winning\" BBQ at all costs. I'm not a fan of Rollin' Smoke with how their prices have gone up, but at least the quality of their food is far superior to Jessie Rae's!  Edit: And what a helpful response from someone who works there! Seeing as how that was my first time there, how am I supposed to know that I need to specify what amount of fat I want for my food? I've been to TONS of BBQ places and that's never been a question. If that's an option, then whoever is taking your order should ask each customer when they place their order how much fat they'd like. And to say it's my fault that I didn't specify it because some of your customers like fatty meats, that's ridiculous. If you don't like the fact that I didn't bring it up to your staff when they were slammed and had a line out the door, or that I posted this review just one day after, then that's ok in my book. Classy customer support from the establishment. And yes, I mentioned your competitor and how 1, I don't go there anymore, and 2, about the quality of their food. If that's referencing them a lot, then I guess I'm guilty. Sorry the truth hurt with this review, but you won't have to worry about anymore from me as I won't be going back again, which I was willing to do because I wanted to try your pork and I think your sauces are great. Oh well, no loss in my book!"}
{"text":"Just visiting and was looking for a southern BBQ lunch spot.  Found this place inside of Cactus Jack's.  I had the double brisket sandwich that was absolutely amazing.  The brisket was so tender and flavorful.  Topped with an original Cole slaw- an awesome sandwich.  My companion had the half rack of ribs that were just falling off the bones tender!  The God sauce has a very unique flavor and instantly addictive!   This is definitely one of my Vegas favorite spots.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This barbecue sauce is killer! Pictured here is the maniac fries which were recommended to us and the double brisket sandwich. Value for your money is out of this world in the best way possible. Set up reminds me of a real southern spot , felt like I was driving across the south again. They even gave us some of the brisket to try by itself and we could barely use our forks because it was so tender. Not only do I recommend coming here, but I recommend not eating for the whole day just to have room."}
{"text":"Food is amazing !!! We got ribs( which were so moist and fell right off the bone) briskets  and the jive (bbq chicken on top of tots). If you go you have got to get the bbq corn and mac and cheese as your sides !!! It will change you life."}
{"text":"Yes, it may be small, but don't let the size fool you.  This is some of the top BBQ in town, almost as good as Texas BBQ, the portions are HUGE we shared a plate with an additional hot link.   The sauces were fantastic watch out for the hot one though, because it was HOT! The flavor was very good, but it was hot. The other sauces were excellent, also.   The ribs were excellent, we had the pork ribs and not the beef, but the table next to us had the beef ribs and they looked amazing as well. I haven't seen beef ribs that looked as good as these west of Houston Texas.   The brisket was cooked as good as any I have had in Vegas, you could tell it was done low and slow.   The pulled pork was cooked with care, you could also tell that this was done correctly and that the bone came right out with ease as the meat was tender and delicious.  The only thing that wasn't off the chain was the hot link, which I would have again, but I would prefer my hot links to have more spice to them. Also at a place such as this, I prefer to see them making the hot links & sausage in house, I do not believe that they are here.   Over all this is an excellent BBQ joint even though it is small. Good things do come in small packages.   -Allen"}
{"text":"Best ribs ever. Loved their corn and smoked butter and zesty potato salad. Def worth the trip"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today due to a friend's recommendation. I ended up getting the Duke fries. Holy cow, so good! The bbq sauce has an awesome taste & a spicy kick. The pulled pork is also super tasty, not dry in any way. There's a serious lack of decent bbq places in Vegas & this definitely beats all the others. I'll be back.  Great service too!!! The guy helping us out was super nice as well."}
{"text":"We had brisket, baby back ribs, and hot links. All three were great! Staff was friendly and ordering was easy. Place was a little snug on seating but the owner said they were expanding next door. When we are in Vegas this where I will go for BBQ."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've ever had... Vegans better go near this place or they'll be converted to into a carnivores smoked meat inhaling monster with the slightest whiff of the smoky aroma that flows down the street, inviting everyone within a mile to come enjoy the delicious array of meats they have to offer. I'm in love I live in LA and haven't been to Vegas for 7 years but I'll be coming back extremely frequently for this amazing meat candy that melts in your mouth leaving you with an intense craving for MORE! The sauces are ridiculously amazing! The GOD sauce is BOSS! I had to bring some home with me for sure! I can't wait to try it on everything! Thanks for the BOMB GRUB!!! BTW  The service is great and extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Check out the video that I posted to see some of their meats that came with the \"great variety\" meal."}
{"text":"Best BBQ IN VEGAS HANDS DOWN! I go to a lot of BBQ joints from fancy to restaurant chains and hands down this is the best! Local guy is super nice and the foot has all the right flavors. Try them out!"}
{"text":"We have good BBQ in our state, but this was the best BBQ I've had. And it was cheaper than we usually pay.  Jessie Rae is also a friendly guy."}
{"text":"OMG...in Vegas for a week from New York and looking for some good food and found Jessie's Rae's BBQ. The brisket was mouth watering, the ribs just came right off the bone, chicken was delicious, and the sides just complemented everything. Go to it asap if in town. You will leave happy, stuffed and wanting seconds and thirds."}
{"text":"Took a W today by finding this place under the free delivery section on Postmates and boy did it not disappoint.. Not even with a 20min delivery to my house and warming it up in the microwave! I can't imagine how good it is right over the counter I've had lots of BBQ and this place was phenomenal. The meat was so tender and juicy. I don't think I've ever had rib meat fall off the bone quite like this before! Also the bbq beans were amazing as well. From now on when I'm in the mood for bbq this place will have my business"}
{"text":"Went there to have dinner Saturday night and drove quite a ways to get there and they were closed. Big sign said \"Sold Out\"  Guess they ran out of food. I've never seen that before, too bad I wanted to try their ribs.. Oh Well"}
{"text":"Truly bomb food! We drove by it at first, since no sign from the road that the restaurant was in the Cactus bar. However, Once you but anything from this restaurant in your mouth, you'll be in heaven! The \"God Sauce\" is beyond amazing. So happy we found this place! Nice job!"}
{"text":"Great food. Look forward to more next time in Vegas. Many unique and tasty dishes."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME, I've been in Vegas for 2 weeks and I've been here four times (because I found out about too late). I even bought a 3 meat combo to take back home to my wife in L.A. I will definitely be making a trip back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place, very innovative , They advertise as a Las Vegas style bbq, its different than most other bbq places in town. Top notch bbq meats and what is unusual but I crave is the is the Red Slaw, simple, but simply good, its cabbage with thier vinegar based BBQ sauce on it. You have to try it along with your Bbq. The BBQ sauces here are in my opinion the best in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Killer prime rib, brisket, ribs. Small place! Come early! They run out.  Some the best I've ever had and I've had a lot! I will be back."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich. Very good - tender, good slaw, soft fresh bun. I'll be back for the ribs next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"For a straight forward review, scroll down to the bottom and click \"Reviews Not Recommended\".  *Update and response to the owner below*: *Is that all you can say? \"Get over it\", I paid real money so I gave an honest review, everyone else please read my reviews below. It seems like you have a lot to learn on customer service and running a business. Try again next time."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I have had! I lived in Texas and have rated every other brisket against TX brisket and this place beats it! Go Here but go early! Seating is limited."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS ! The waitress at the front made us feel like we were family! Such a great bbq spot and so worth the price! At first when she was talking about the food we thought she was just trying to sell the food but no way! She was right!  The meat just melts in your mouth, and the sauces? Perfect! Will definitely be back every trip we make out here. If you have a chance to visit, please do yourself a favor and visit!"}
{"text":"There is no word but awesome!  Outstanding.  Award winning. Just add cobbler, pecan pie and real cutlery. Loose the VH1 tv!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because Postmates was offering a free delivery promotion. Not totally disappointed but I probably won't order from here again - there are far better options in this city. The meats are generously portioned, juicy and flavorful. Rolls are a real downer and wasn't impressed with the Mac-n-cheese although it does have a unique flavor. They sent two 1.5oz portion cups of sauce for a meal made for 4 which I paid extra for. The kicker was the \"mini cobbler\" - $4 each for approx. 4oz \"cobbler\" that was almost exactly the same as the dessert that comes in a kids cuisine TV dinner (see attached pic)! So sad. Anyhow, I wish them the best of luck and hope they choose to improve these issues.  *Review update: the owner responded blaming the Postmates driver, saying that they were being nice by sending me some sauce even though I DID actually order and pay for it with my meal, and proceeded to inform me that the quality of the food would be better if I came in. Maybe it's just me but you should probably pride yourself on getting quality food to your customer regardless of how it is getting to them. An attitude like that tells me I should have given you two stars instead of three and you certainly won't get my business again."}
{"text":"We took our family here and we were beyond surprised at how amazing their food was!!  We will be coming back with our family of 5!  We have 3 boys- 15, 10, & 5 and they ate until their bellies were full- and enjoyed every bite.  The meat on the ribs fell off the bones! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Do not let the small size of the dining area or the short hour scare you off.  This place is the REAL DEAL and amazingly good.  We came at 5:00 on a Friday and while they were out of most of the sides, there was enough meats left to serve everyone who came in.  And can I just say the tater tots CHANGED MY LIFE.  They sprinkle them with powdered unicorn or something.  Pork spareribs, chicken breasts, chopped brisket and pulled pork were all AMAZING.  Dry rubbed like whoa, beautiful smoke ring on everything, and a char crust that soaked up sauce like it should.  We weren't brace enough to try the Fallen Angel sauce, but the sweet and sassy \"God Sauce\" was perfect for dipping, and the thin vinegar-based \"Pig Sweat\" was particularly good with the pulled pork and chopped brisket.  We will be back for sure to enjoy Jessie Rae's again!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten Jesse Rae's a few times because of parties that I've been to and every single time they have been absolutely phenomenal! I have pretty much tried everything and I can say  that I have loved everything!! I definitely think they are the best barbecue in town! I am from Texas So I like to think that I would know o good barbecue and Jessie Ray's is definitely give Texas barbecue a run for their money. The restaurant is small so don't expect to take a big group there but I would definitely recommend them for any party or catering that you might have! Their briskets are juicy as hell and sides dishes are so tasty. Now let's get to their barbecue sauces because those are the real deal from the hottest one called Fallen angel to God sauce! Which If God eats barbecue I would imagine that's what he would want his sauce to taste like. The names fit the sauces perfectly! Jesse Rae's is the best barbecue in town hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I think of fine Texas BBQ that reminds me of home, I think of Jessie Rae's!!   I can't even put into words of how expertly crafted their food is!! It is heaven sent, melts in your mouth, orgasmic even! Ordered some food for Easter and everyone that came was stunned and wanted to know where on earth was this food from!!! (Not over exaggerating) I have had their pulled pork which I never eat ANYWHERE ELSE, its juicy and full of flavor.    Their brisket is the best, their ribs and sausage is just as delicious.   On to their side dishes!! Mac n cheese, coleslaw, and baked beans go perfectly with every meat. But you CANNOT I repeat CANNOT forget to top the meats off with their sauces that are to die for!!! God Sauce, Fallen Angel, and Pig Sweat!!!! Mike and Jessie make a great team cause their food is the Shit!!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas...So far. Ribs are good. They have beef ribs ever so often. Look on their FB page. Their BBQ sauce is Not as great as they make It out to be. At least not for me. The coleslaw is homemade but average. The brisket is good for out side of Texas but this brisket would not be served in Texas. They don't even ask you what part of the brisket you want??? But for Vegas it is the best you will find. Very small. Don't be afraid to share a table. Make a friend. This is a good spot."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Vegas. Definitely get your money's worth. Brisket is to die for!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I usually go for the ribs, pulled pork and brisket but this time we tried something different. We got the Maniac Fries and a side of corn!!!! OMG! It should be against the law! It was soooo good!! We topped out Maniac Fries with the best sauce we've ever tasted (God Sauce) this stuff is addicting!! Give them a try! Mike's always super nice! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to LV I make it a point to try at least one new BBQ restaurant. Over the past six years I've been to over 2 dozen BBQ joints. After going to Jessie Rae's, I don't plan on trying any others. I'll only come back here. The beef rib and st Louis style spare ribs are by far the best I've had. The service and staff were top notch as well. If you're in Las vegas looking for great BBQ, look no further"}
{"text":"I have heard this spot was amazing, from friends from Texas thought it was odd as they hate Las Vegas bbq. Boy where they right from the time you exit your car you smell the bbq. When you get in side everyone greats you as if your Norm from Cheers..lol Try all the BBQ sauces.. You can't go wrong, the pulled pork and brisket are on point! ! ! I now go at lest twice a month. .. Please do your self a favor and try it! ! !"}
{"text":"OMG YES!!!! This BBQ is ridiculously good. My new favorite BBQ place in town. I'm not a huge corn fan but decided to give it a shot. Stupid good!! Their prices are reasonable also. Definitely a great place to check out"}
{"text":"Went to  A catered BBQ Sat 27th of February. We had pulled pork, coleslaw, corn, Mac and cheese, buns, and strawberry shortcake. The pork was AMAZING! Best since I left Tennessee! The slaw was just right, sweet and crunchy. The strawberry shortcake was very good and tasty. I would suggest that they try to make a creamier Mac and cheese. The corn was just eh. The staff was very friendly and helpful, I would give them a 9 because the side dishes were just not up to snuff. I am going to go to the restaurant because I don't think you can get Pulled Pork that good ANYWHERE else!!!!!' I will be a repeat, repeat, repeat customer as long as I live in Las Vegas!  PS They had some pretty amazing sauces too, especially liked their traditional BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's may be small, but the BBQ they produce packs a powerful punch. I considered knocking a star off due to how small this place is, but the flavor of the 'que coupled with the excellent service from the owner makes Jessie Rae's top notch   Jessie Rae's is an award winning BBQ spot that smokes the meats for 13 hours. They are also a rather new business, and in the short time they have been open they have earned quite the following (and rightfully so).  Add these things together, and as any BBQ aficionado will tell you: There is a chance they will run out of things. So get there early!  I love hole in the wall spots, and based on how busy Jessie Rae's has been every time I have gone, clearly I am not the only one that knows about this little gem. On my first visit, I left slightly disappointed as I had planned on eating my lunch there but couldn't due to a lack of seating. When I say this place is small, I mean tiny... There are only two tables inside, with room for 8-12 diners, so again,  get there early!! Or be prepared to eat outside at one of the picnic tables, or take your food to go.  On my second visit, I met Shirley B for lunch and Mike (the owner) was manning the register. What a fantastic guy, I love businesses where the owner is not simply present but actually a hands-on worker, and that's exactly how it is at Jessie Rae's. Mike was cordial and made us feel right at home as we dined. He even brought out a sample of the daily special, a phenomenal smoked Filet Mignon that I immediately wished I had ordered.  What I DID order was fantastic. I always get ribs when I am able to at a BBQ spot, and the ribs here were perfection. Tender, meaty, delicious. The brisket was excellent as well.  I loved the sides, especially the corn that Shirley got and let me sample. And that sauce! Everything I have had is lick-your-fingers good.   If you love BBQ, be sure support this fantastic local business and give Jessie Rae's a try ASAP."}
{"text":"My Review of Jessie Rae's BBQ: The brisket is good, but that's about it. I didn't have the best experience at THIS Jessie Rae's BBQ because I felt that my order was wrong and the rest of the food was just okay.  Overall, I'm not dissing Jessie Rae's BBQ.  I'm dissing Jessie Rae's BBQ inside Cactus Jacks.  I'll just have to try their original location.  Until then, a very generous 3 stars is all they get from me.    The Food: -House Hold of Three: This is supposed to be a huge sandwich with brisket, pulled pork, and a smoked sausage.  Instead, I got an average sized bun with pulled pork and chicken.  My order was wrong and since I was craving brisket, I was a bit disappointed.  I brought my order to the bartender and he stated that my order IS the House Hold of Three.  Well, they better fix their menu then.  Look at my pictures. I see chicken in my pictures, not brisket or smoked sausage.  Fail!  The good news was that I was able to try the brisket since my girlfriend got it. The brisket is good and I recommend it.   -The Pulled Pork:  Not the best.  Maybe a little more sauce is needed to hide the taste of grease.   -The Chicken:  I didn't order this, but ate it anyway.  It was just okay.  -The Mac n' Cheese:  Small, a little pasty, and bland.   -The Baked Beans:  Besides the brisket, this was my favorite. Very rich and hearty.   The Service: The main dining area was closed off and I'm not sure if they typically have servers.  They didn't on the day that we went so we gave our orders to the bartender.  Our food didn't take too long to be served.  I still feel that my order was wrong.   The Establishment: Located inside Cactus Jacks.  Keep in mind that you're in a bar, which also means you'll be dining with the cigarette smokers.   Tips:   -Try their original location.  They have all the great reviews.    2016 Yelp Review #14"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Best brisket ever. My sister and I came all the way from Chicago and this was our first stop and we couldn't have made a better choice. Everything was fantastic and we can't wait to go back on our way home, this will be our last stop!!!"}
{"text":"I am currently eating the best BBQ I have ever had in my life. This place is amazing! We ate the brisket, ribs and the Duke fries. Everything was phenomenal. He also brought out some smoked corn which was the best.   The dining area is small, but don't let that stop you. It's so worth it! The owner was so friendly and genuinely cared about his customers and wanted to be sure everyone loved what they were having.  We will be regulars :)  OH! And the prices were great too. Especially for legit bbq."}
{"text":"Ordered thru postmates and am slightly displeased. The food is pretty good however it's annoying that the extra sauce I paid for never came through and the meat really needs it. For the price you pay I don't know that it's worth it. I was hoping I would have ordered enough food for lunch and dinner today but instead my man and I are done eating all of the food and still feel a bit hungry. Might try again but probably not"}
{"text":"[UPDATE 3/21/18: Confirmed via phone that they don't offer AYCE any longer. It's still yummy food though.] Having a tiny dining room to myself almost makes me wanna keep it that way, but I'm puzzled that I'm only the 6th person to try the new AYCE offer.  I was going to head back to Jessie Rae's BBQ sooner or later, and they enticed me back (relatively) sooner by announcing an all-you-can-eat offer via their Facebook page on April 1st - but they're not actually foolin' around. It's only available Mondays through Thursdays, 2-6pm, but if you really want to fill your belly with smoked meat for just $25, maybe you'd better take a day off to enjoy this.  AYCE basics here: up to two meats at a time in relatively small portions, including any pork ribs (spare or baby back, two bones at a time), pulled pork, brisket (chopped or sliced), chicken. Beef ribs and burritos not allowed, I'm not sure about limits on sides, and I'm guessing the \"loaded\" dishes, sandwiches, and tacos are good. And, of course, no to-go boxes, but I was welcome to a fountain drink and ended up shuttling my Gatorade fruit punch out the door (but let's be honest, everyone knows that drinks are such a cheap expense for businesses).  My orders went as follows:  - baby back ribs, brisket (chopped; I didn't specify), cole slaw - spare ribs, pulled pork, waffle fries - spare ribs, corn w/ smoked butter, tater tots  I don't recall seeing the huge, fatty spare ribs on the menu before, and I enjoyed those more than I did the relatively petite baby back ribs. Brisket and pulled pork were both pretty good, if a bit dry at times. Cole slaw was the same creamy goodness that I'd previously enjoyed, corn was not as bad as I remembered back at their now-closed second location, and both types of fried potatoes were perfect in crispy/fluffy texture and flavor. I can vouch that the tater tots stay crunchy for at least an hour, or however long it took for me to slowly clear enough stomach space to put down the last rib.  Sauces are still the star. I wasn't that enamored with the Pig Sweat (vinegar sauce) this time, but both the God Sauce and semi-spicy Fallen Angel remained addictive. That makes me grateful that they have one of each sauce bottle per table now. It's not that large an expenditure for them because there are only 4 tables inside (and a bench outside). Maybe it's just an off-hour of the day, but I was fortunate to have time to finish my scraps without feeling that I was taking up space (all the while enjoying their Futurama marathon streaming on TV).  Jessie Rae's is still one of the best local options with their \"Las Vegas Style BBQ,\" especially through their regular menu. Those are filling enough as-is, and they have the advantage of portability, so you'll only want to attack the AYCE here if you have a huge appetite and a fair bit of time - but if you do, prepare yourself for one of the better off-Strip buffets of any shape or size."}
{"text":"I've been missing out on some good BBQ around town, but I'm glad that I've started to rectify that mistake tonight.  Jessie Rae's BBQ seems to have built a strong local following, but they're a bit inconvenient due to short hours at their original location. With their new expansion to the dining area of Cactus Jack's, you can now have them for dinner. Just the thing after a long day of work.  It gets a little smoky inside the building due to the bar-goers, but it's not as bad as I'd feared. My friends and I sat in a booth, which is well-lit and about as far as you can get from the bar area. Service was a little slow even though we were the only table of diners; consider viewing their menu on their web site beforehand so that you know what to order right away when you're first greeted.  Honestly, the star for me is probably the God Sauce. According to the dude in the very dirty \"white' lab coat, it was on top of at least two of the meats, with the drippings-focused Vegas sauce also included. I didn't get around to the super-spicy Fallen Angel sauce, nor did I taste anything that resembled the vinegary Pig Sweat sauce. Anyway, the God Sauce is one of those instantly addictive tastes that really complements meats but can probably work just as well through a straw. It's not too sweet either. I'm sure some BBQ purists are laughing at my naive sauce worship right now, but if it tastes good, I'm going to enjoy myself.  In terms of actual food, we forewent the \"casserole-style\" dishes and the sandwiches and instead focused on the meat combos, namely the Pick Three ($19), with that number of meats and 1 side dish included. They didn't have the beef ribs or tri-tip listed in the fine print - note to self, go to the original location and go early - but with our two orders, we managed to get all the standard meats including enough ribs for everyone.  The ribs were my favorite meat in this meal. They don't have too much of a spicy kick, but they are smoky and bursting with flavor otherwise. The first few bites were ridiculously tender, but for some reason I ended up with overly dry and tough-to-crew bark on the bottom of my portion of ribs. That's ironically the only thing keeping this rating from a full five stars. Perhaps it would've been a skewed opinion due to my intense hunger, but it was how I felt for most of the meal.  Reportedly removed recently from the smoker, the pulled pork with Vegas sauce was really good as well. If you love the flavor of pork, you're going to get all of it here. Juicy, tender sinews of meat will delight your taste buds. The table-side plastic knives probably aren't even necessarily to cut down the lengthy fibers because you'll be able to chew right through them.  The chopped beef brisket was pretty good. Admittedly, I'm not an expert, but I welcomed the idea of more fat due to these pieces being taken from the fattier part of the brisket (and they were out of sliced brisket anyway). I didn't think it sang to my palate as much as the pig proteins did.  The chicken was surprisingly good. Chicken is notoriously not a flavorful meat, but that means that the smoke flavor that it took on was very noticeable. It was also quite tender.  Finally, I didn't notice anything remarkable about the somewhat sweet sausage, and the portion seemed to be smaller than all the other meats. It's my most likely skip in the future.  Between the two sides that we each had, the mac 'n cheese made a bit more sense than my sweet corn with smoked butter. Starch and meat are natural friends, whereas the corn (a typical favorite of mine) didn't seem to synergize with anything else on the plate. It didn't even taste that buttery. I'm gonna have to pass on my childhood favorite food next time, sadly. The mac was good but didn't stand out, and I didn't miss it after when it was quickly devoured.  Overall, I experienced a very satisfying meal at a reasonable price at Jessie Rae's BBQ \"#2\" (sue me and my numbering). I'll likely visit their original location soon to seek out their other meats, but I could see myself returning here after my BBQ exploration is over and done.  (Quick update 3/12/16: No new meats today. Tried the baked beans and slaw. The former really gives a lot of creaminess to some drier meats, and the creamy, apple cider vinegar-y slaw is great alone or with any meat.)"}
{"text":"Very rarely anymore am I left dumbfounded and speechless with food. This was one of those rare times. I cannot begin to describe how delicious this bbq is! (My brother in Texas is going to kill me for saying that) . My husband and I were hooked from the very first bite. Great flavor combinations and sauces. They have four different bbq sauces to try and all are unique and good. Highly highly recommend. Great hole in the wall! And we found it through Yelp Pass it on.  P.s. TRY THE MANIAC FRIES"}
{"text":"Best bbq i have ever tasted. The waffle frys with whatever sauce they put on them is so good! The belt buckle platter with either tri tip or brisket is amazing. The mac and cheese off the hook! The portions are worth the money. Super cool guy that owns the spot! Seriously, Check them out!  And thanks to the owner for hookin it up today he had us all set up with like a taster platter of hella meat and sides we took some home im eating it again now for dinner! Amazing BBQ no joke!"}
{"text":"Boys it's time to get down to a taste that you can only appreciate being born south of the Mason Dixon line. When I set down for supper with a big 'ole helpin of JR's BBQ drenched in his infamous God Sauce/NC mix something happens - my face smiles without me??? Ehh- hell it just taste good and reminds me of summers as a kid on the farm in the north east Georgia foothills all the family gathering round the picknix table for supper. Thanks for supper Jesse"}
{"text":"Finally able to get there a week or two ago, half an hour before closing. They were out of everything but ribs, so that's what I had, with beans.  Very tasty.  The ribs were lukewarm and kind of wet--my guess is that they were already cooling it down and reheated it with steam.  Minor annoyance--they sauced the ribs (and the beans) before serving--despite there being sauce at the table.  A note:  at the time I visited, they had a sign saying they were open Saturdays, but ONLY the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of the month."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! Try the pork with the god sauce and some mac and cheese."}
{"text":"We found this BBQ home in the wall and were delighted. We felt like we'd found the local spot and enjoyed being off the strip. The meat was tender, juicy and delicious. There were 5 sauce choices on the table including vinegar and mustard based as well as a fantastic traditional sweet and sour. I hesitate to use the word traditional since it was out of this world. We had the chicken, pork, and links and wiped the platter clean. Next time we'll have to try the tri-tip. The server was helpful with descriptions and checking on us.    Loved it!"}
{"text":"Well, I hear lots of good things about this place! This supposed to be the new hot bbq place! This is the second time I called to order because the first time things were sold out!! So I couldn't wait to see the what is all the fuzz about! The sandwich was good and the ribs were good! I don't find it special though! The fries were wayyyyy tooooo salty! Up to the extend that I couldn't eat another bite!"}
{"text":"This is probably the last place to go in Vegas for BBQ.  It feels like the operator of this place is more into the food than the business, but the food is not good either.  Not even Jon Taffer could save this place.  Bad Location:  In the middle of the raw construction supplies district where there are no other restaurants or residences for miles, very inconvenient.  And there are only 5 parking spots.  The inside is just big enough for 5 dirty tables and a sticky floor.  Poor Service:  The girl behind the counter was so inept that I almost felt sorry for her.  It was like they randomly picked a girl at a shopping mall and threw her behind the register to take orders 10 minutes before I arrived.  She was completely aloof.  The menu is not user friendly, some items don't describe to you what they are.  I asked other people in line and they agreed the menu was difficult to understand.  Overpriced Food:  It would take a lot of BBQ sauce to cover the mistakes with the dry $12 brisket.  My order was incorrect but since my first interaction was such a pain I said screw it and tried it.  So bad I just got up and left.  \"God Sauce\" is a stupid name and is mildly offensive.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing bbq and creative sides.  BBQ mashed potatoes are insanely good!  Besides great food they have great service!  The individual that helped us spoke with such pride and passion I thought she may be an owner - but she's not.  Just a great employee."}
{"text":"Super good food at this place. The cashier Morgan is funny and really patient. I love the brisket and those HOT LINKS!!"}
{"text":"Wow... amazing the best barbecue I had in Wild small place buy wow again .. I totally recommend this place.. the stab was nice .. definitely you have to try this place..and yes I will go there again..and agian.."}
{"text":"Best bbq we have had in a long time!! We got their kinda late and wasn't sure what to try but the owners Mom helped us out and suggested on what to eat!  The service was excellent and the food was even better especially the fries .... next time we are in Vegas we will for sure hit this spot up again!!!"}
{"text":"I had the\"Household of 3\" sandwich for lunch/dinner today, it was so fracking delicious. This place has some great meat to eat. I love me some Jessie Rae's BBQ."}
{"text":"When it comes to what to have for dinner, Mom always knows best. That was definitely the case at Jessie Rae's BBQ. I was playing at tournament at the Rio when I started craving ribs. Asking the experts at the hotel - security - one name echoed enough times to send me straight to Yelp. Jessie Rae's not only came up instantly in paid ads, smart, as well as a good sign but it was also close by. And it's reviews were terrific.   My flip flop got stuck under the front door as it closed behind me and it took me three attempts to free it. \"I hate when that happens,\" the lady behind the counter said, removing my embarrassment after a clumsy entrance. Owner Mike Cross wasn't around, after all it was Sunday night, but his mother, Samantha was. \"Are you visiting, this your first time?\" She asked. I was a virgin. But If the food was good as the customer service was, I'd be luckier here tonight than at the casino.   As I eyed the menu wall, Samantha offered \"Whatever you order, you have to try the god sauce, you'll be back for more.\" I was studying the Wall, I began drooling while choosing, a good sign. The smells were teasing me. Her words still ringing in my ears, my choice got easier because I was told I'd be back. I'd try the \"Big Belt Buckle, brisket covered waffle fries covered in cheese\" and the pulled pork sandwich another time. \"Ribs, pulled pork and Mac and cheese for my side\" was my order. \"Help yourself to some sauces and I'll bag you up\", Sam advised. I chose the house BBQ, which Sam told me was the god sauce. I doubled down.   Back in my hotel room, surrounded by pig bones, mouth slathered in a mess of god sauce and rib bits, my hands sticky with it too, I'm one happy man. This is the best barbecue I've had in years, possibly ever. The meat separated from the bone as if under its own will. And the flavor? Delicious fails this food, it's too weak a word. This BBQ will make you want to slap your Grandma\" as my buddy Rusty used to say. That and \"The cook is legit,\" said Yelp reviewer MIchael R, also from Long Beach. I couldn't say it better. Just go."}
{"text":"Great barbecue food and not expensive. We had the ribs, pulled pork, brisket and criss cut fries and they were all phenomenal. Very good quality and juicy meat and a simple great tasting barbecue sauce. Friendly, down to earth staff who create a nice laid back environment to enjoy some great barbecue."}
{"text":"Now I've had my far share of BBQ and this place has to hit the top. It's an amazing little hole in the wall you look for. The taste is amazing, fall apart aspect of the meat, great sauces, the Q paper goods. It has a at home feel to it. I've never been here before but the people helping spoke to us like they've known us from prior visits which is great. I came in thinking it was just normal BBQ items but there was much more and a huge variety of choices.! I will DEFINITELY be back to try different things.! I'm glad I searched and took a gamble on this place cause the payout was amazing.! Just go try for yourself."}
{"text":"Go get some sauce in your mouth! They have this ghost pepper BBQ sauce and a nice sweet one... they only have two sauces?!?!?! with those two they actually pull it off quite nicely.   They also open at like 1030 which was a perfect way to start/end not really sure, my day.  Brisket unreal delicious bark, great rub and with just a little sauce goes down so smooth.   Short rib, huge and I actually enjoyed the bark so much on it I didn't even add sauce.  All the sides were so good, just the right amount of dressing on the slaw, beans had a nice smoke brown sugar flavor, and the mac n cheese... goodnight!   THE VERDICT: One of the best BBQ places in vegas, open up your mind and go and try it, especially that ghost pepper bbq is such a sweet and spicy sauce that makes you feel so macho youll turn into randy savage. I'm alex and I approve of this message."}
{"text":"2.5 rounding down to 2 here. Came in around 11 30am and they were already out of ribs. The lady working there said that happens all the time..I mean, you already are open short hours, why would you be out an hour or so into opening? Anyway, I wanted to get the 3 meat combo. Since all they had left was chicken, pulled pork (which I am not a fan off) and brisket I went ahead and got double brisket. Now normally I don't mind being charged extra for stuff, but since you are out of the very thing I came in for, you might want to stay off charging me $7 extra just for getting double brisket. That and having to bag my own to go order, as I was just handed a togo box with another togo box with my side on top of it ( I guess I should just carry all that in my hands). So I already had a bad taste in my mouth, even before trying the food.  Now for the food. First of all I really didn't care for the bbq sauce at all. They smother the whole order in it, so I really had no choice but to have it anyway. Brisket was pretty dry. There was a good amount of it and the chicken but both were bland. It was probably a little better than the majority of Las Vegas bbq places, but that's not saying much. The mac&cheese was limp overcooked bowtie pasta with cheese..hmm. Baked beans I ordered as an extra side, because it happens to be one of my favorites. They were pretty good, smokey and pretty tasty. Probably my favorite thing I tried. I shared with my gf and we both agreed it was subpar.   So overall not a very good experience, I can't imagine I would give them another try."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place and I'm glad he did.  While it's not cheap (a 2 meat combo with brisket is $17+), the portions are good sized and the meat is wonderful.  There are only 4 tables inside, and the 2 times I've been here I haven't had a problem finding a seat.  I recently started working with a client about a mile from here, and I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was psyched to have a new bbq place in my neighborhood. Got a two meat combo with mac and slaw. The mac and cheese was refrigerator cold. I guess they forgot to microwave it? The meat was lukewarm and contained a lot of very hard bark. The sauce was slightly warmer than the meat. They forgot my slaw. I had to sit in a smoky bar waiting on my food, which was later than quoted. This is some amateur nonsense. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered and paid for my meal on the yelp app because my coworkers were going to be picking up lunch here and I didn't want to drive anywhere. I got the hotlink sandwich w/ a side of macaroni and cheese. My coworkers ordered ribs, and BBQ chicken meals w/ the same pick up time, yet they had to wait for my order after receiving theirs. The sandwich was pretty good, but the macaroni and cheese could've used some seasonings (onion salt, garlic powder, paprika...something). I would consider having their hotlink sandwich again. However, I was really grossed out by how DIRTY the containers my food came in were! It looked like whoever served my Mac n cheese was handling the food from the grill with their bare hands and never washed them. The container my sandwich was in was greasy and had drip marks on it. Not only was my food not ready at the time selected on the app, but it was filthy!"}
{"text":"The most AMAZING BBQ spot in town! I love this place! Meat falling off the bone and don't you dare touch my plate...I will bite. God sauce and Fallen Angel sauce are so amazing; the perfect amount of heat with the perfect amount of lots of flavor. I've had pretty much everything off the menu but my favorites are the pork ribs, beef short ribs, brisket and corn with that delish rubbed flavored butter. Did I mention how the meat falls into your mouth, so moist and flavorful Oh my.... Let's talk about the catering, I had my birthday catered for about 20 people of family and friends and everyone fell in love just as much I was. I also pick up lunch here for me and my co-workers and they are in love as well. Prices are awesome and so are the portions. If you want to support a true local that just so happens to have amazing food look no further than Jessie Rae's."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Jessie Rae sandwich with the crushed BBQ chips with a BEER!!! Yum! So Sad this location closed but they still have the 5611 S. Valley View open!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! This is by far the best BBQ I have had in Vegas. We were debating over dinner when I started browsing yelpEAT 24. This place came up with 4.5 stars. I convinced my hubby with the Duke. I am not disappointed at all! 4.5 stars is not a fair review.. 5 out of 5 most definitely! Will be eating here again"}
{"text":"This is by the far the best BBQ in all of Las Vegas. The flavors are amazing, the meats are so tender and delicious, and the sides are excellent. Plus you get a lot of food for the price. The bbq sauce is perfect. I have tried many different bbq places in the city and Jessie Raes is so much better than anything you will find. Mike, the owner, is passionate about what he does and wins all kinds of bbq competitions. They are also perfect for catering and large groups. Everyone who has tried their BBQ raves about it and I crave it. Its amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now, I'm used to Southern BBQ, it's just a little hole in the wall, but incredibly tasty BBQ.   The meats are all very moist, even the brisket.  Oh yea, I love the corn, beans are average, but waffle fries are great."}
{"text":"If you like eating food then you will love this fucking barbecue place. It's so goddamn good don't be fooled by the crummy inside or outside it's not important. What is important is how well they make that God damn brisket, ribs, chicken and pulled pork. Sensible prices and decent combos are great not to mention their impeccable sauces. Any place that bothers making their own sauces proves that they care about the food they serve. Do yourself a flavor favor and put Jessie Raes in your face. Only criticism is the Mac & cheese is soggy. Good work everyone."}
{"text":"They don't do anymore, but Monkey scored a one time AYCE:  Babybacks, Spares, Mac n Cheese, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Bbq Mash  Thankful I was able to sample most, the only things Monkey like are the ribs. Brisket & Pulled Pork were too dry for my taste and sauces didn't help. Sides were meh.   Monkey shall return for Racks of:  Spare Ribs $26.25 Babybacks $25.25 Beef Ribs $36.25  Friendly, helpful service."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a friend so we decided to try this BBQ place out.  The place is small but very organized.  I ordered a two meet combo brisket and something else (sorry I can't remember what it was). When we arrived it was lunch hour so it was a bit crowded but we found a table pretty quickly. It's a BBQ joint so it isn't fancy at all so don't be discouraged by the decor because the food is pretty good.  I personally think he prices were a bit high for what we were served and the guy that took our order was a bit short with us as we tried to figure out the menu.  The parking lot is crowded so again you will need to be creative or patient.   I think I would like to go back again when I have more time and prelook at their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered from ubereats and I was honestly not disappointed.  The bbq was amazing with the combination of slaw and chips on the sandwich, the bread was even quite delicious.   I also got a side of baked beans and it was very good.  I'd recommend anyone to eat the food here, it definitely exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in he wall BBQ joint, and that's what I LOVE about it !! The owner definitely has a passion for top quality bbq. You can tell he uses the highest quality rubs and knows how to cook. Not to mention he is the friendliest guy you will meet. There seems to always be a line so get there early. I had the brisket sandwich and it was stacked, very fair value for your money. If you haven't tried this place yet you need to. I will definitely hit this joint every time I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"Ugh, I hate to say it but... it wasn't good... I've been eyeing this place for a while, all of the reviews and pictures had me drooling. So my friend and I made our way over yesterday and... behold disappointment! We tried the meat and side sampler that's available with a Yelp check-in ($16pp). It came with Brisket, Pork Baby Back Ribs, Beef Ribs, Pulled Pork, and BBQ Chicken. The sampler produced lots of food but honestly wasn't worth it. Most of the meet was really dry. The brisket and pulled pork were least dry but just OK. Both turned out pretty fatty. The pulled pork was actually juicy in some parts and was fall apart consistency but dry and chunky in other parts.  Sides were OK, we got Mac n Cheese, Corn, Beans, Potato Salad, and some weird chunky potatoes - kind of like breakfast potatoes that had mash mixed into them? Mac n Cheese is my favorite side but it was not cheesy at all. It actually did not resemble what I have seen in other pictures at all. My favorite side here was the potato salad which I am usually not a fan of but it was the best side here. Food tasted like it wasn't fresh, especially the meat. The beef ribs were especially dry. Like super stiff pieces, dry. The food is nothing I would come back for but the home made BBQ sauce and the nice owner is what added a star. I actually felt bad because the owner asked how we liked the food and I wanted to tell him! I felt bad doing so in front of other customers. It's a tiny place and you will not have a conversation at your table without all the other tables hearing it. Think, size of a master bedroom. Who knows may be if the food was fresh it would taste better? I can't see how it wouldn't."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time.  Customer service was excellent with the family feel.  Beef ribs on Thursday are huge and juicy with tater tots.  Mac and Cheese covered in brisket will leave a long lasting memory.  I have tried Rolling Smoke as well and I have to say Rolling Smoke may have more seating but the food at Jessie Rae's is to good to pass up.  Thank You!!!"}
{"text":"Spontaneously dropped by for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Decided to order the Three Combo Special with double ribs and 2 sausage links with corn and roll. The BBQ sauce blended well with the meat"}
{"text":"The BBQ is so good! Best BBQ I've had in Las Vegas. Awesome staff and great flavored. My favorite is the Pig Sweat sauce. If you love great BBQ you owe it to yourself to come here."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. I will return.  Had three meat combo with brisket, pulled pork and ribs (in lieu of hot links because they were out). Loved the brisket. Not usually a fan of vinegar sauces but this was great too."}
{"text":"I have never in my life had better food. (Sorry mom)  Jessie Rae's BBQ is everything you want when you're craving delicious BBQ! There's more to this joint than what meets the eye!   The Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, pulled pork, and brisket is TO DIE FOR. (Don't get me started on the hot link sandwich)  In layman's terms - If I knew I was dying tomorrow... I'd want Jessie Rae's to be my last meal."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall smokey bbq. Came here for lunch break. Ordered big belt over fries. It was amazing! You can taste the smokiness in the brisket. I grabbed extra sauce while I was there and I'm glad I did. The nachos could have used a little extra. But I like it saucy. I recommend the fallen angel bbq. Super good with a little kick. I smashed them and needles to say the whole office smelt of smokey bbq. Everyone wanted a bite. But o didn't give it to them. Lol #sharingisnotcaring. Finger lickin good bbq sauce. Wil not use a napkin. That's a waste of food. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"So the rumors are true!! This is the best BBQ in town! Ordering online was super easy, my food was waiting for me when I got there, and I was greeted like I had walked into Cheers! I had a fabulous experience and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good BBQ so we decided to leave the strip and come here. It was well worth the trip. The ribs were delicious and very tender and the brisket was very good also. Warning though, the serving are huge. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Oh my God! This place is amazing!  Awesome selection and pricing! I will be back, Wayne sent me!"}
{"text":"Came in and had The Duke. James was really nice and good came out quick. Absolutely amazing and worth the price. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall (4 small tables, maybe 12 chairs) has to be one of the best, if not the best, bbq joints in town! Mike definitely knows his q. Get yourself a 2 meat High Roller. Pulled pork and hot links are great, as are the baby back ribs. Sides, get the corn with smoked butter and fries. Meats are tender and flavorful, but if you want more their award winning sauce is readily available. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had such a great experience with this restaurant. We needed a venue for small family birthday party of 25 and called for recommendations. They volunteered to hold it right in the restaurant for us and it was just right. The food was excellent and there was more than enough for our party and 2 or 3 more. Several family members bought at least one of their sauces to take home. In a town of chain restaurants, it's nice to find a local, family run spot like Jessieraes."}
{"text":"I was super excited to check this place out, but after I did my overall feeling was confusion.  When we got there, the parking lot was completely empty which I took as a bad sign. But, Yelpers promised it was great, so we soldiered on. Inside, the place was packed, which I took as a good sign.   This place is a hole in the wall in every sense. It's in kind of an industrial area, it's a tiny place with maybe 4 tables, and there is nothing fancy inside (broken floor tiles, mismatched chairs, self service drinks/sauces). While we were waiting for our take out order, a family (clearly from out of town) came in and was obviously put off, and even asked if they were in the right place and if there was a 2nd location somewhere. BUT, I can overlook all of it as long as the food is great, right??  So was the food great?? Again, a mixed bag. As far as the meats go, A+. The chicken and brisket were both excellent. Super tender and flavorful. I, also, enjoyed the sauces. They have 3 to choose from, a thinner vinegar based sauce, a thicker/sweeter sauce, and a super spicy ghost pepper?? sauce. I enjoyed the 1st 2. My husband braved the 3rd one and confirmed it's spiciness, but felt it still had a good and balanced flavor.  Where the food disappointed me was in the sides department. I had both the baked beans and the corn with smoked butter. Both just tasted like they came out of a can. Really disappointing given how great the meats were. I was told by another customer to order the waffle fries, and I wish I had heeded that advice."}
{"text":"High points, Loved the brisket, aggressive seasoning and totally on point. Super juicy but still a great chew. Easily could have doubled down on brisket and been happy. Meh points, waited a while to be helped and then greeted abruptly with \"you ready?\" I came at the lunch rush perhaps, subsequent guests got a much nicer greeting.  Everything I touched was sticky. Mac and cheese was just alright.  I'd go back for a second try. There's some good stuff happening, and hopefully I'll see it next time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I was so disappointed :(  I ordered delivery, I'm not sure if this makes a difference, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I had The Duke (pulled pork) on Mac & Cheese. In the same order, but for someone else, was The Belt Buckle (brisket) on Mac & Cheese, and a few 2 meats and 1 side combos, meats including chicken, brisket, spare ribs, and pulled pork.  The biggest problem was the sheer amount of grease that was on The Duke and the Belt Buckle. It was seriously off putting. The second problem was that the mac and cheese had zero cheese flavor and the macaroni pasta was over cooked, incredibly bland.  The meats themselves were tender, but overall lacking in the flavor department. I honestly mostly tasted grease, even after draining the grease off my meal. The thought of getting waffle fries or tots that would soak up the grease is just terrifying to me.  I felt the food was over priced for what we got. Portions of the Loaded in Las Vegas meals (aka the Duke and Belt Buckle) were good, but the flavor made me feel it wasn't worth it. The portions of the 2 meats and 1 side meals looked small for what we paid."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 meat. Ribs,brisket, and pulled pork.  I also ordered cornbread. They didn't give me the cornbread for starters. They gave me a slice of brisket that was 99 percent fat. The ribs were very fatty, and the pulled pork was sitting in a half inch of grease. The food was not even edible. Terrible. Never again."}
{"text":"I have dined at this location of Jessie Rae's a handful of times now and I am proud to say we have AMAZING BBQ in Vegas everyone!!!!   I have never been to their Valley View location and this location is located inside Cactus Jack's bar. If you are sensitive to smoke, get your delicious BBQ togo! If you wanna hang and enjoy a beer while you eat I highly recommend Polygamy's Nitro Porter, it's a well balanced dark beer that stands up to the sweet notes in the BBQ sauce. Speaking of sauces Jessie Rae's know sauce. Their God Sauce is out of this world and has ruined me for other BBQ sauces.   On to the meat!!!! Chopped Brisket is where it's at. It's my favorite normal menu item.  Beef Rib is my numero uno fave but is not always available. Refer to my picture to understand how amazing that rib looks. Guess what!?! It tastes better than it looked!!!!! I picked up the bone, that was the length of my forearm, all the meat fell off. My picture actually doesn't to it justice, there's meat all around the bone!!!!! It was like a beef rib steak. I used a fork and knife and ate it like a steak lol this rib was tender and full of flavor do not pass this item up, it's available on weekends(for now anyways) Pork ribs are fall of the bone tender and flavorful. Best I've tried in Vegas. I always order these :) Pulled pork was alright, I am not the hugest fan of pulled pork to be completely honest. But if someone said, \"Hey! I have pulled pork from Jessie Rae's! Want some?\" I would respond with a firm, \"Hell yes!!\" Their sides are large and it really hard for me to choose. The BBQ mash is legit! I love the Mac n cheese, corn, green bean casserole, baked beans with large pieces of brisket throughout, and the cole slaw!!! So basically all the sides. I love how they aren't salty but they are seasoned. And they pair so well with the meat!!!!   Check out Jessie Rae's! Now!"}
{"text":"Came here cause they had a groupon and thought be perfect time to give it a try. The bbq was delicious and very authentic. Ribs were fall off the bone and pulled pork was also very good."}
{"text":"In visiting from Chicago,  came with some friends from Las Vegas - enjoyed an awesome meal that had filled us so well that we may not need dinner tonight!   The meat was banging!  Great flavor profile!  Plenty of food served too!  The sides - and we had a bunch - were absolutely fantastic too!  If you like Q then be sure to stop in here and meet Mike. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Jessie Rae's BBQ close to closing time but the guy was kind enough to still make us food!!! A++ for that! We got some brisket which was the scraps but to me that's my favorite part so I didn't mind, pulled pork, ribs, Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, corn.... we had a buffet of yummy food and we ate till our tummy's felt like it was going to explode! That sauce tho!!!! Bomb.com! Will be back soon to dine in and really soak in the experience! :)"}
{"text":"This a small corner restaurant. However, the food was super yummy and the service was awesome. My hubby and I have been dying to try it given all the good reviews on both Yelp and Facebook.  My husband had the Maniac Fries (reg size). They  are waffle fries toped with brisket, hot links and mac and cheese. Yes, they were super yummy. The brisket from my double brisket sandwich was super tasty and moist. Its also topped with coleslaw which I normally hate, but it made the sandwich and I ate it all with a little help from my hubby. We also decided (mostly me) to try their spare ribs which also did not dissapoint.   We will definitely be going back. Please remember thay this is a small place. They have about 4 tables in the dinning room which seat around 15 ppl max. They do delivery and catering for larger parties."}
{"text":"Looking for a Friday night dinner spot for me and my fiancé and came across Jessie Rae's on Yelp.  The reviews made it sound like we couldn't go wrong.  Unfortunately,  neither of us were very impressed with this place.  It was difficult to find and when we walked in we did a double take them went back outside to see if we missed something.  Some proper signage would be lovely.  After going back on Yelp and reading reviews we determined that we were in fact at the correct location so we went back in and sat ourselves.  It was very smokey inside and there was nothing separating the dining/no smoking section from the smokey bar area.  The server that greeted us was clearly not a server,  maybe a cook filling in? He was visibly sweating and his clothes were dirty and had holes in them. Looking back I'm wondering why we even stayed to eat!    The food was mediocre at best.  He had a sausage sandwich, I had the pulled pork sandwich and we split some waffle fries.  Nothing was impressive.  The BBQ sauce was pretty good but my sandwich was overpowered by bread and slaw ."}
{"text":"Best bbq on the west coast. Live this place. The sauces are to die for and the maniac fries are simply the best. I'll be back at least twice a week lol."}
{"text":"We had the Big Belt Buckle Fries and the Jessie Rae. Both were delicious. We got the Large  fries and glad we did. This is the brisket I have been looking for in Vegas. Lots of flavor with the right amount fat left on. Order the large, as you will be able to share or eat alone. I was a little disappointed in the Jessie Rae sandwich. There was not much pulled pork on it at all. I should have read the menu closer. It does state \"some\" pulled pork. However, the Vegas slaw was most excellent crunchy and fresh. We will. be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had in Las Vegas. Amazing food and great atmosphere. Very personal and simple menu. All of the food is good"}
{"text":"Got the two person sampler plate for about $45 with 4 drinks. The meat was really good and the pulled pork was my favorite I would definitely come back and get a pulled pork sandwich if I had another BBQ craving. Get the side of corn it was definitely the best. Definitely enjoyed the three different sauces none of them are overpowering and they are all unique in there own way. Try them all the hot really isn't hot."}
{"text":"One of the best bbq place in Vegas! Other that can compare is John mulls. Brisket was juicy. Ribs fell right off the bone. And Mac n cheese was amazing with dry rub seasoning on top. Must try! Closest thing I can find that can live up to traditional Texas bbq. Owner is a cool guy too, knows how to run a family oriented bbq place. Good vibes and good food is all u can ask for"}
{"text":"Awesome ribs!!!  The meat fell off the bone. I've been here since 1979 and I've eaten at all the BBQ joints in town. This one is no doubt the best. They even deliver. Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"The food is a definite four. With that being said, it's a take out place. Even at opening the tables were all dirty. When bussing between customers they leave the very dirty tablecloths and half of the disposable ones. That includes the used paper placemats dribbled with bbq sauce. The good news is the meats. I ordered a half rack of the pork spare ribs. They were juicy and meaty. The tenderness left you eating every last morsel. The meats are flavorful and perfectly made."}
{"text":"Absolutely no complaints.  While in Vegas we found this little, out of the way BBQ restaurant and thought we'd take a chance on it.  We are so glad we did!  We agreed that the BBQ was some of the best we've ever tasted, the prices were reasonable and the service was friendly. We are just sorry that we only had carry-on luggage for our flight leaving Vegas so we couldn't ask to purchase extra sauce and take it home with us."}
{"text":"The meat was very tender!!  The mac n cheese was delicious. Very friendly atmosphere. I will return in a heartbeat!!!"}
{"text":"Their brisket is amazing. Great sauces. Tender meats. Mac & cheese is better than most."}
{"text":"Great food, waffle fries and chicken was an hit.. Will try to mke that at home back in Cali, for sure thanks for the idea.. Great friendly staff will come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The Belt Buckle w/ Waffle Fries and God Sauce ... Unreal!  Crispy Waffle Fries ...... The Best Fries I Have Ever Had!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Some of the best Mac and cheese I have ever had! Their maniac fries are to die for! I make it a point to come in almost every week on my day off because it's so good! The girl Morgan is always there and she's the best! Super sweet, great customer service and always remembers me!"}
{"text":"Never stops impressing me. We were posted in the area again and decided we needed some more delicious food and stopped by. Ordered and quickly got the food! Always generous servings and will put you into a food coma!! Will recommend them to anyone looking for BBQ or just some great food in general! Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Side dishes were the star! Cloe slaw & potato salad  Pulled pork & spare ribs were greasy.  BUT DID MELT IN YOUR MOUTH  once I got past the grease and fat. I will return.  EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE on my to go order thru yelp."}
{"text":"Finally found great BBQ in Vegas. Great brisket wonderful flavor in the sauces. This will be my new spot."}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's BBQ is a new little BBQ gem in a little area outside strip behind Mandalay Bay. Parking and seating can be limited at times and gets pretty busy certain times of day. Had the awesome Maniac Fries (half order only)  -it was huge, filling, mac n cheese and brisket/sausage on top of waffle fries, I tried a few waffle fries before but the ones here were crispy, crunchy and seasoned, one of the better.                                I tried samples of meats through friends pulled pork/brisket were both tender and flavorful, ribs were tasty. The Sandwich the Jessie mac was huge w/ brisket & pulled pork double decker, it was loaded and high -I had to used a fork & knife for help. What made Jessie Rae's different is the sauces they have to go with the food, sauces like The God Sauce, Slammin Bama and spicy Fallen Angel sauce -all great on everything, My favorite was Alabama and god sauce mix, on waffle fries, brisket, pork on top of cole slaw. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Landed in Vegas with the fellas and looked up Best BBQ. Let me tell you, Jessie Rae's does not disappoint!! I ordered the 3 meat combo of which I chose spare ribs, brisket and hot links. Brisket was tender as can be along with the ribs. You can tell good cue when the meat stands alone and no sauce is needed. But if sauce is your thing, they also hit a home run with their award winning sauces. If you're in Vegas and looking for good BBQ, forget the rest and head on over to Jessie Rae's!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try! It's a small restaurant but I must say, the BBQ is amazing! I ordered the Jessie Mac which comes a sandwich that has pulled pork and brisket! Its huge and treat flavor! I loved that the owner is very nice amd friendly. Definitely recommend for people who loves BBQ just like I do!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were on vacation and we were craving BBQ and we found this place on yelp and even though it's a hole in the wall the food here is delicious. I ordered a Mcrib and the sauce they use is addicting. I'm sad I don't live nearby so I can come to this place often but whenever I go back to Vegas I am definitely going to stop by here."}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs and they were VERY good, loved em! Eric was very nice too, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Huge portions, great flavor and original sides. The owner was friendly and honest about the choices. I ate the food for three different meals there was so much of it, and the whole thing cost $20. Jessie Rae's is the real deal when it comes to BBQ!"}
{"text":"BBQ food is always great! This place in particular had to much grease. I tried the duke. Which are waffle fries and pulled pork. The waffle fries were soaked in grease."}
{"text":"I'll give it three stars because they're trying, but I won't be back. 1. The place is SMALL.  It's not really worth it to try to eat there.  I was forced to eat outside at the picnic table.  A table that doesn't get wiped down too often BTW.   2.  The girl at the front counter needs to learn to stop texting when a customer comes up to order.  She also needs to learn to bring napkins with her when she brings food to the guy sitting outside. 3.  They ran out of Brisket.  How does a BBQ place run out of their most popular meat by 3:00PM? 4.  Their current location is in a sorta seedy part of town.  It's not very close to where anybody lives.  Since the store is so small they sort of depend on take out, but I don't really think the place is worth the drive.    I used to live in Texas and to be honest there really aren't any good BBQ places here in Las Vegas.  So I am hard to please when it comes to BBQ.  I wish these folks well.  I hope they can move to a larger restaurant soon for their own sake."}
{"text":"Dont be fooled by the tiny little restaurant., everything was delicious. We had the pork ribs, tender juicy fall of the bone, the waffle fries with brisket, delicious if you like fatty brisket, I prefer mine a little leaner but still great flavor and finally we had the beef ribs, my absolute favorite, huge & great flavor! Excellent BBQ and excellent service."}
{"text":"Amazing place to visit  Real tenders ribs and tips, defining i recommend to try their brisket and cslaw."}
{"text":"Wow! Brisket and waffle fries...and pulled pork. Gotta come back for the Mac and cheese.  Get there early."}
{"text":"This has now become Home, to all my BBQ needs. This place is truly amazing with Taste, Customer Service, and Consistently putting out  food!!   Unfortunately I will never be eating any other Las vegas BBQ besides Jessie Raes.... Tell em Big \"D\" sent ya!!   I truly Salute ya Mike! Tell Mom I said Hello"}
{"text":"This place is the best barbecue ever. I found this place out of luck and it doesn't appear to be much. It's family owned and run. Not much of a dining area. Mix match hand down furniture but they try their best to make it work and make you comfortable. But don't expect parties over 5-6 to have proper seating. Really really amazing food I love coming here"}
{"text":"Foods good, but the chairs are falling apart and the place seems kinda dirty and the food isn't cheap, it's a real hole in the wall.  Despite that I wanted to return the next day I call to place an order, but they ran out of meat, so whatever I figure I come back tomorrow.  Next day I come in, same issue no meat other than spareribs, I find this out after waiting for two, \" people\" to ask every question under the sun about portion sizes.  These two somewhat minor inconveniences and the fact the location is out of the way is keeping me from ever returning again, there's a lot of good BBQ places here to spend money at that are much more convenient.  It explains why each visit I made only 3 people were there despite the food being good quality, maybe I'll try them again in 2019.  Quick update owner responded to my benign review, I decided to change to a 1 star from a 3 star, weirdest customer service exchange of my life.   He sends me string of snarky PM's then publicly post a professional response, one that I would have expected In the beginning, but did not receive until posting my PM's. Sure I can't wait to return lol."}
{"text":"I just stopped in here today to have lunch with a friend, and I was blown away.  I had never even heard of this place, but who could turn down trying a new BBQ spot?    As soon as I walked in the smell hit me and I knew that whatever I ordered was going to be amazing.  Turns out I was right.   Everything here tastes darn fresh and homemade. This is definitely not a fast food type place.  The quality of the food is top notch and everything feels like home cooking. I went for the micrib sandwich and waffle fries.  The rib sandwich was so generous I could barely hold onto it.  Giant pieces of ribs, \"god sauce\", between two BBQ soaked buns.  What's not to like?    One of the signature experiences at Jessie Ray's is the sauces.  There's 5 BBQ sauces on every table, all of which you've gotta try!  I especially loved the fallen Angel and pig sweat; but the god sauce is most people's favorite.  Either way, all of it was amazing.  If you like BBQ I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I can see how they won Best BBQ in the Vegas newspaper ratings.  So good.  Ordered the brisket over tater tops and the pulled pork over mac and cheese.  The brisket was very good but the pulled pork was incredible paired with the mac and cheese.  So good.  Small location with only a little dine-in space and limited parking so do take-out or choose when you  go to dine in carefully."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town! Blows Rollin Smoke out the water! The brisket was tender and flavorable, ribs fall off the bone,  the bbq sauce is delish!   You must try the Belt Buckle. It has crispy, seasoned waffle fries, brisket and sauce. Seriously the best thing I have eaten.   Service is friendly as well :)"}
{"text":"This little place is phenomenal!!! I moved to Vegas with my family in 2013, since then I have been searching and searching for some really awesome BBQ. Finally, after trying many places I HAVE FOUND the most amazing BBQ in the area. The brisket is so good my coworker couldn't even speak for a few minutes after putting it into his mouth. it is prefect. I had the pulled pork on a bed of homemade mac and cheese and some of their fries. It was fantastic. Vegas this little place may not look like much, but don't judge a book by its cover. This is by far the BBQ I have had since moving to Las Vegas! I will definitely be back. P.S. When you go make sure you have some of their God Sauce, it is heavenly!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today using a Groupon.  Wow!!!! So delicious and the ribs were really tender. A new favorite for sure! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price, AT ALL.  One of the most common questions I get as a cab driver is about food and one topic that I hear alot is bbq.  As a black guy from Chicago with parents from Alabama, my childhood had alot of bbq.  As a result, Ive been to any place in vegas using the bbq theme.  This was sadly a waste of my time and tips (17 bucks).  I ordered 2 meat special, brisket and ribs with Mac and Cheese.  The brisket was actually lower end grocery store roast.  It was cooked ok, the ribs were very skinny and honestly tasteless.  No smoke flavor more like a baked style with a broiled skin.  The ribs tasted ok and the food did stay down, which has become a standard for me here in vegas.  I would suggest rolling smoke, at least there is a flavor, there brisket is actually brisket and you get a roll to die for.  I will not be back to Jessies and will not recommend it to any fares.  I honestly expect them to be out of business soon, i doubt they are solvent. Last but not least, some of the WORST bbq sauce ive tasted."}
{"text":"We just came to Vegas for the presidential debate. as we do in each city we visit, we pick a BBQ place to try. This time we chose Jessie and we were lucky and happy to try this heavenly food.. go for the brisket and if you dare try their (Fallen Angel) sauce.. i definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"These guys are by far the best ribs ive ever tasted and beleave me ive been to alot of diffrent places being a trucker always on the road thier ribs are just so meaty no fat at all and full of flavor brisket the best tri trip excellent chicken needs a lil work thier sides are dreaming good need to work on makeing them bigger though and thier filet migion also great pulled pork yummy i could go on and on about this place thier sauces are excellent"}
{"text":"Easily THE best BBQ I've ever had. We had a wonderful experience. Hidden away in a saloon, it was quite the find. Wonderful service. You can tell the owner takes extreme pride in his wonderful selections. They accommodated our every request with a smile. Will be back in no time!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars is a must, if there was 10 stars then i'd give 10. I have tasted some great food working in Las Vegas the past 10 years , But Jessie Rae's BBQ, just jumped to the top of my list of MUST TRY !!!!!!! The food and flavor is OUTSTANDING and service was great. Defiantly be back. Do yourself a favor and go try Jessie Rae's BBQ"}
{"text":"As of now, the best low and slow BBQ in Vegas.  Award winning?  Yes.  But accolades aside, the real reason I wanted to try them;  the direct, bordering on rude comments the owner / pit master leaves on less than glowing reviews.  Anyone willing to lash out and defend their food must take pride in what they serve.  Put up or shut up.  Four guys,  all solo meats (sold by the half pound) and ribs (sold by 1/3, 1/2, full rack).  Sides are not necessary and take up stomach real estate needlessly.  Brisket - Fat requested.  Nice bark, excellent smoke ring, sweet smoke flavor throughout, solid rub imparting a good seasoning, relatively moist and pull apart tender.   Beef Ribs - Good amount of meat on them bones.  Nice bark, deep smoke ring and once again sweet smoke flavor.  Great seasoning, very moist, and tender.    Pork Ribs - Beef is king but these were good.  Fall off the bone tender.  Well seasoned.  The sweet bitterness of the smoke works to increase the natural sweetness of the pork.  Though not a sauce guy, let's just say the God Sauce (sweet tomato based sauce) should be used instead of chocolate in the bedroom.  Squirt it on anything good.  The Pig Sweat (Carolina style sauce) works well with pork if you're into that.  The Fallen Angel (sweet tomato based sauce with distinct flavor and spice of habaneros) packs a kick without killing the taste buds though heightens the bitterness of the smoke.  Prices in line.  Service, friendly but no nonsense.  Go early, they do sell out.    In the end, all the fundamentals of proper low and slow BBQ are present.  A meal happily enjoyed on the hood of the car."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq spot in town. The Duke is my go to. Friendly staff and great sauce selection at each table."}
{"text":"So my co-workers decided to pickup lunch from here, well while the bbq may be good the southwest salad is so not worth the price! I could have bought a bag of slaw and a can of corn, there were no beans the container was barley half way full. Oh and the kicker the website says the price is $9 with no meat but was charged $12."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! What a great find and great BBQ. The hot link sandwich is amazing. The staff is very friendly. Food came out quick. I must for all BBQ lovers."}
{"text":"Kind of an interesting experience eating here for the first time. In town for a biz convention, got a hankering for some baby backs. Yelp retrieved this place with the improbable avalanche of suspiciously great reviews.  Uber dropped me at a hole in the wall that's cramped even by the limited standards of rib joints. Ordered the 1/2 rack of baby backs while dodging the elbows of the guy at the next table. Ribs appear quickly enough, but the sloppy, too-cool-to-want-to-be-good-at-his-job server promptly dumps them on my lap, staining my jeans.  The too-cool-for-this-shiznit dude hands me a couple of feet of the lowest spec of cheap paper towels -- the kind that doesn't actually absorb ANYTHING, much less bbq sauce -- and disappears.  Another guy (the owner? He seemed to care) has noticed and quickly brings out a damp towel for my jeans, which helped a lot.  So, not exactly a great first impression. And I was sitting there thinking I was going to one-star this place like nobody's business.  But then I bit into the first baby back. Holy crap. Kid you not, the best ribs of my entire life. Just amazing. Flawless, delicious, thick, meaty, juicy to the point of insanity.  My mind is still reeling, actually, and it's now hours later.  So count this as a ten-star review for the ribs, because they started five in the hole.    If I lived in Vegas I'd eat here a few times a week.  If you're visiting Vegas, you MUST plan to eat here.  You will NOT be sorry."}
{"text":"Ugh what do I say about this place? I had high hopes but it was just horrible. I'd never heard of the place and the reviews seemed decent. We walked in at 6:15 on a Sunday night and we were the only ones there and that should have been a huge hint.  I ordered the 2 meat plate and my husband ordered the 3 plate. I got brisket and pork ribs and smoked corn. We shared the waffle fries with bamama sauce?? Basically waffle fries with a sauce that had no flavor...at all. The brisket was HORRIBLE!! Over cooked and tasted like it sat around all day. The pork ribs were the only thing that were decent, just shy of good. The smoked corn was gross. The worst part of the whole experience was they were out of Bbq sauce?! But we were informed the 'chef' was making up a batch. Well we already have our food so that sucks for us. We had a choice of the Carolina style or flaming hot burn your lips off...half way through the meal they brought out the regular Bbq sauce which was good so I could cover my brisket so it was edible.  Obviously we won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Award winning BBQ and it shows. Incredibly good food. Everything was fantastic. Definite must try for BBQ lovers in town. The duke fries are amazing. The ribs sell out all the time because they are so good. Stellar customer service. Run by a wickedly talented team.  Support small business ! Go here !"}
{"text":"We loved the valley view location And are so happy to have to have one closer to our home in the Silverado ranch /GV area. Amazing barbecue - amazing people. Eat in or take out - we've done both. The brisket is amaaaazzing. Definite must try if you like BBQ ! Support local business !"}
{"text":"Rip.Off. Ordered a 3 meat combo for delivery and it came to $33. There was enough food in there to feed 1 squirrel. Okay maybe 2 small squirrels. Prices are highway robbery. I hope the other BBQ places decimate them."}
{"text":"The fundamentals of any restaurant is to first have clean bathrooms and dining tables. Sadly that was not the case with the bathroom and at our table. The server/hostess/busser left other tables with dirty placemats, someone over worked I could understand but they had just opened so our dirty table was from the day before.   But..the barbecue was outstanding!, tender, tasty, smoky, falling off the bone yet not mushy. Great flavor and very rich and complimentary barbecue sauces perfectly enhanced the great flavor. So I will return again, but only for takeout!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ can't beat it for your $$$ !!! Come get some ... I live close and I'm glad it's not del taco lol  great brisket !ribs!and pork & bbq sauce! Get 2/3 sides also!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing find. My friend wanted BBQ and I wasn't even really feeling it until I got my food. Jesus, dude. I was in the zone...  I ordered the Jive Chicken and the guy behind the counter said they were out of chicken, as they just fulfilled a large catering order, so he actually pulled one of the chicken dishes from the catering order for me! Thanks guy!  Our waiter was also super cool and personable. I would absolutely go back to Jessie Rae's. I wish I was there right now..."}
{"text":"I have to update my review just to make it perfectly clear that Jessie Rae's is consistently amazing on multiple levels. The customer service is wonderful. The owner, Mike, leaves the front of house to his wonderful mother. She is a saint. So personable, welcoming, a straight shooter.   We had some family in town visiting from North Carolina and brought them here for lunch. We ordered quite a bit, as we were a super hungry party of 5, and were accommodated so quickly. My family was blown away. Totally loved it. Said it was better than any BBQ they had in the Carolinas.  But the ribs. Oh. My. God. The spare ribs are to die for. Literally, the best freaking ribs I've ever had. My 5 year old son would agree. I have never seen a kid that size put down that much meat and that many waffle fries in my life. He LOVED the pastrami special last month. I don't think I've ever seen a kid eat pastrami. I consistently have to argue with him to share because he is convinced he's going to eat a 3 meat combo with fries and a full rack of ribs by himself. In the end, he puts down half of it, all the fries, and asks for an additional side of fries to go.   Back to the ribs. Fall off the bone tender. Flavorful, juicy. PLENTY of meat. You definitely get your monies worth here. Anything you order will be good, I promise you. They have won LV's Best BBQ & Sauce for a damn good reason. Beef rib special on Thursdays, which I am dying to try!   Check out their Instagram for other special menu items, too."}
{"text":"Catered our party.  They did a great job!  We will have them back over and over again"}
{"text":"I went here with my fiance and the restaurant was easy to find, even with a small sign outside. We walked in an hour after opening and all the tables were filled. They only 3 or 4 tables so absolutely no room.   While we were standing in line to order, we were always in someone's way. Drink machine, or condiment table. I had to go outside and wait after we ordered just because you start to feel Claustrophobic.   We got our food and went home to eat it. Did we want to eat there, yes of course but no room...   The ribs and brisket were amazing. This is meat that needs no sauce because it's so flavorful! I did try the sauce and also good! The coleslaw was just as good! I could easily eat 2 more orders of that. So creamy!  The only thing I didn't like was the Mac & Cheese. It tasted like box mac and cheese... No salt, no pepper, wasn't gooey cheesey and pasta was overcooked. I would love to give the other sides a try for sure!   Thank you for bringing good food to vegas."}
{"text":"Not bad, staff is very friendly. Place is extremely small which makes it very difficult to maneuver around but I think they are all about the TO GO orders. I can tell you this, if you're in the mood for ribs then why not go for it. But I'll stick with my own made at the house because they don't have me beat. No offense of course because I did enjoy this place and recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Welcome to Jessie Rae's BBQ. This is a simple little shop in a strip mall in an industrial area of of Valley View and Russell area. As you walk in you notice it is not a very big spot for dine in, but has a good atmosphere. I was at work this day so was hoping to be able to eat in, but you never know. I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich my work partner ordered the Brisket and Tater Tots. The pork sandwich comes with a good helping of slaw and some sauce. It was messy and good. The full smokey flavor of the pork with the tangy crisp bite of the slaw was perfection on a bun. The Brisket was also pull apart tender and had a wonderful bite as well. We tried all their sauces but the god sauce was our favorite. The staff was really friendly and they are very supportive of our first responders.   Thank you for dining at Jessie Rae's BBQ. I will eat here again. looking forward to taking the wife for a full meal. If you are in the area and want a good BBQ meal for lunch or dinner, give them a try."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent! But the beef ribs were the best will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here with the fam and the food was delicious! The service was great also. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place was the absolute best I would highly recommend everything at this barbecue joint and the desserts are to die for. Also we got to meet the owner and his mother which was very entertaining thank you so much for making our visit the best experience!"}
{"text":"Came in after reading reviews decided to take a chance best decision we made meat falls right off the bone!! So delicious! Wort it worth it worth it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT USE THE YELP PREFIX MEAT COMBO....went in and used the the $16 \"special\" for two peeps, $32 total. We received an appetizer of waffle fries covered with pulled pork and sauce which was quite good. Then a plate was brought to us with 3 thin burnt ribs, two small pieces of brisket some chicken, a side of cole slaw and a side of a potato dish. When I bit into the burnt rib my teeth went through the very soft marrow bone and I had to spit it out. Gross. The 1/32\" rock hard bark on the thin ribs were inedible & the bones broke into many pieces. The sliced chicken was decent. They should try a new recipe for the brisket as it was mushy and nothing special. In the meantime I'm wondering if our second plate of food was being brought out. But no. TWO yelp specials consisted of three thin ribs, two small slices of brisket, a small pile of sliced chicken and two small sides plus the appetizer FOR $32. After tip and tax $40. Wow!! The $22 dollar \"hungry three meat item\" seemed like much more food. I mentioned my issues to the owner and he acknowledged. He later brought out two more ribs (which were THE BEST I've had in LV) and two more afterwards. I don't know why restaurants serve their customers their crap only to wait for the complaining and then respond with a much better replacement instead of serving good fresh food in the first place. Bottom line: the owner was very kind and the second ribs were outstanding. I'll be back knowing what and how to order next. BTW the cole slaw was fabulous. Fresh Ribs and cole slaw only for me next time....that is all"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian. That being said, my hubby and kids LOVE Jessie Rae's! My girls could eat the ribs all day long and my son could eat the pork sandwiches until he popped. I stick to the sides and I put the God Sauce on EVERYTHING. Seriously, everything. SO GOOD! We had Jessie Rae's at an event they catered before the brick and mortar store opened and we can't wait to go check out the new location!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and really love it. That God Sauce is just unreal.  Loved the pulled pork sandwiches.  (ask for extra cole slaw on the sandwich)  Also, be sure to get a bottle of sauce to take with you.  My kids aren't big fans of BBQ, but when we use the Jessie Rae sauce they go back for seconds!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, definitely a must to try if you live in Vegas or are just visiting! Delicious food, great portions and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ place I've ever had! We are from Vegas & we come here twice a week! It's bomb!!! Get the manic fries with waffle fries"}
{"text":"So glad I came across someone \"liking\" Jessie Rae's on Facebook! I had the Jessie Rae sandwich and it was amazing! Loved the combination of BBQ chips, coleslaw and pork.. and the bread is so good..I easily ate the whole thing.  The sauces are all great as well.  We were lucky to get a table but now know how awesome it is and can always take it to go!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon worth 38.00 and paid 26.00.  We bought 6 groupons for our Vegas vacation.  All of them were great deals, but not this one.  Why you ask?  Because we went in to order and got confused and spent 26.00 instead of 38.00.  The guy knew we had a groupon and he knew we were not spending enough, because we talked about how much we had to spend.  He knew it and he did not tell us.  I cannot give a good rating to anyone owner or employee that would do that to a customer.  I would not go back to a business like that."}
{"text":"Not really impressed. First of all no parking. Had to park across the street. The place needed some cleaning. The floors were very greasy and slippery. As for my meal. I ordered sliced brisket and it came to me what appeared to be pulled or shredded brisket. It was cold. When I asked for my missing cornbread the waitress/ hostess/ cashier dropped a refrigerated muffin on the table. No butter, just a cold dry muffin.  I will however give them another chance. Maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"If you are rating solely the BBQ sauce then it hit the mark perfectly God Sauce is really something close to heaven.  However if you are seeking price value, customer service and food quality this place fell short of my expectations with such high reviews from others.   I took my family of four for a new BBQ experience only to walk away really disappointed. We all ordered the meat combos and what was served on they trays wasn't worth the price at all. Really the trays were half empty. I ordered chicken and brisket with potato salad. The cashier yelled from the kitchen door they were out of potato salad then walked up to the table and asked what else I wanted which was nothing however the rest of the family got a mac and cheese to share. I got five chunks of dried chicken and a slice of brisket that was 1/3 fat slab. My mom did say the hot links were good and my little did enjoy their mac and cheese. They gave us complimentary corn bread that was served cold with a slop of butter on top which really wasn't a treat; honestly I thought it was to makeup for items that weren't available but no she did it for everyone in the restaurant. It was just really mediocre and I am disappointed we spent $100 for a meal that left us leaving feeling blah and even worse when we walked out we still were not satisfied of having our craving for BBQ fulfilled.   Also with my oldest son aspiring to be a chef himself one day he found it really disappointing when the kitchen door opened and the prep area was filthy and food was being kept in crock pots.   As I sit here writing my review the hostess is bragging that no one ever complains or is disappointed leaving well we decided that the four of us won't need to eat here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to get off of the Strip to try something a little more authentic. I tried the pulled pork and brisket with bbq mashed potatoes, and have no regrets. I tried most of the bbq sauces at the table, and their award-winning bbq and the carolina mustard-bbq sauce were my faves. I had the cornbread too, but it was a little too dry and would have been better if it were warmed up. Overall, this restaurant was a good choice."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to try this place out... Having moved from Virginia last year we've been searching for some good BBQ. Unfortunately this place did not quite live up to the hype. My sister got the Duke fries with a side of cole slaw and I got the two meat combo with spare ribs, chicken and Mac n cheese. The sides were pretty good, but nothing extraordinary... Typical choices for BBQ joint, I guess we like our southern BBQ with some greens. My sister enjoyed the fries and noted how they definitely don't skimp on the meat. For me the chicken and ribs were pretty average as far as the meat and cooking go. We both agreed that the draw for this place is definitely the sauces. We really enjoyed mixing the Fallen Angel and the God sauces.  All in all it's pretty average BBQ for us... Better than Famous Dave's but not quite up there with the best"}
{"text":"Just the best bbq I've had in las years  The staff is friendly  And the cooks are legit"}
{"text":"Omgosh !!!!! If you drive by and not stop .. Your making a huge mistake... This place is beyond amazing .. The owners are so friendly .. The best BBQ Ever..we drive all the way from California to eat here .Thank you for our amazing lunch"}
{"text":"I have tried many Bar B Que place here in Vegas. This has to be one of those hidden gems. I think I have found my new lunch stop."}
{"text":"Awesome place, small, friendly, fast and great customer service! I love to see a small business doing good like this! The pork is to die for! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the weekend and my buddy practically forced us to eat here for lunch and I must say, I'm sure glad he did. He had Jessie Rae's a couple days earlier, but said he wanted to eat it again since it was THAT good. I initially wanted to eat something on the lighter side but I thought what the hell, why not. I'll go to the gym to work it off (we'll see about that).  Ordered about $60 worth of food for 3 people (if you want a full meal with enough sides to go around, expect to spend around that much, which is normal for good bbq). We got ribs and pulled brisket for our meats and mac n cheese, coleslaw, baked beans, and corn for our sides.  Now I'm no southern BBQ connoisseur but I've tried a good number of places so I have a good sense of what's mediocre and what stands out. Jessie Rae's BBQ is the best I've had hands down. The sides were all delicious, especially the Mac n cheese. Cheesy but not gooey or mushy. The meat fell right off the bone for the ribs and when you dunk them into the sauces they provide, \"MMMMM willy don't it make you wanna slap yo mama!!\" (Friday reference, anybody?)   Will I make it to the gym tomorrow as I promised myself? Likely but not certain. Will I be returning here next time I visit Vegas? F*ck yes, without a doubt."}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's BBQ...what can I say...BEST BBQ I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!! The food was AMAZING!! The sauces to die for!!! The staff was so incredibly friendly and we were even given a free sandwich from the owner!! Don't miss the waffle fries for sure SO DAMN GOOD!!! We drive through Las Vegas six times a year, and each time we come from now on our first stop will be JESSIE RAE'S!!! If you are in Vegas do yourself a flavor, I mean favor, and EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. The maniac fries are unreal. Add on the sauces they have (gods sauce is the best), and you're in for a treat. The staff is super friendly, family run, and ensures that you enjoy your food. They've been open for 2.5 years and I wouldn't be surprised to see them expand in the future. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the food. The food here is good. Really good food. I mean really friggin good. But the lady needs to be replaced stat. When we first started coming here she was really nice and cool. But you can tell she's getting burnt out. Every time we've been coming here her attitude has begun to degrade on each occasion.  Other than that the food is amazing.   The other part is of this review is that they need help. Give her a break or some help."}
{"text":"We usually like to go to Rollin Smoke on Highland but its a bit far from where we live so we were trying to find some good bbq and unded up here. The reviews previously written made it sound good so we went for it! Boy were we happy, the food selections and overall deliciousness was fantastic! My husband and I got the special for $16 ea it was phenomenal and we had leftovers. The sides were good I would say that the mashed potatoes were a little different but I really liked them however, I would order them without the white bbq sauce drizzle. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sandwiches and pulled pork. Great quality meats!! I loved the Double Brisket sandwich and the Loaded fries!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ we've ever had.  Highly recommend the pulled pork, brisket, waffle fries, and of course, the God Sauce.  Check this place out, just be aware that there is limited seating in the actual location."}
{"text":"This place is a total locals place NOT a tourist trap. There's nothing fancy here, seating for maybe 10-15 total at most and when I was there probably 80% of the orders were to go. You aren't here for ambiance or whatever, you're here to stuff your piehole with first rate BBQ. The brisket was about perfect, lean and tender and you could cut it with a fork. The baby back ribs were amazing too and were about as meaty as I've seen anywhere. I liked their sauces too, especially the hotter one which is a little different than the usual BBQ sauce. The sides here are okay but aren't anything special, the beans and mac and cheese could've come out of a can. Doesn't matter though, the meat makes this place worth checking out."}
{"text":"For a long time, I would be asked what I thought was the best BBQ in Vegas and respond Rolling Smoke. I have tried a variety of places and stumbled on Jessie Rae's.   I recently ate there and loved the food. I especially enjoyed the beef rib which had a great taste and texture to it.   Reading through the negative reviews of the place are typically people complaining about the location, delivery, and the look of the place. Most great BBQ is found in not so great locations.   If you are looking for a sit down restaurant for BBQ with waiters etc, I don't think this is where you want to go. If you want great tasting BBQ, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Must try Vegas Restaurant*   This is the best barbecue I've had in a long time. I thought Lucilles at Red Rock was good. This is better 10x Fold. I would go work the corner if I had to, just to get another taste of this BBQ. Very good, and the God sauce goes perfect with all the meat I tried."}
{"text":"So i've been meaning to come here for the longest and finally had a chance to try it out. It's hard to say which BBQ place in Vegas is the best after this but this is a serious contender. If Yelp offered .5 star reviews this would be a solid 4.5/5....  I had the three meat combo with:  Brisket - spices on it are good   Baby Back Ribs - fall off the bone and so tender...fire  Rib Tips - so tender, so flavorful, so good and i don't even fuck with pork like that  Mac & Cheese - pretty good however the best I have had  Cornbread - the butter on this was flames...had to be brown sugar and something  Sauces were such boss. That Fallen Angel sauce ain't that spicy but has that shit that makes your soul burn slow and have the flavor that you need for some heat...  It's hard to say whether this is the best or where it ranks in Las Vegas BBQ because of me not eating BBQ in awhile however I can definitely say that it is in the top echelon of BBQ in Vegas..."}
{"text":"One of the best bbq spots in town,the ribs are so bomb and  all the side dishes are delicious and the owner is friendly. And it has golden knights stuff all over the place, another reason i take my buisness there lol. #vegasstrong #goknightsgo"}
{"text":"AMAZING find. Everything we had was amazing. Great flavor, perfectly spiced. I loved the Maniac Fries, hot links, & Mac n cheese. Pig sweat sauce was phenomenal. Super friendly staff and quick service. Great lunch find."}
{"text":"Great place off the strip. Fast, efficient and friendly service. Most importantly the food was great. Baby backs and chicken were my favorites."}
{"text":"We were shopping in the area and saw this little... Diners, Drive-ins and Dives place. The food was excellent! We shared the 3 meat combo (ribs, chicken and brisket), with Mac n cheese. Pretty much off the charts taste wise and cost effective. I highly recommend it. I mentioned Yelp, but they didn't give me my free side and discount...oh well, I'll catch them next time"}
{"text":"On 12/15/17 I took my car in for servicing at Findlay Chevrolet.  When I picked up my car I was told that there was BBQ lunch for all staff and customers.  WOW!!  How nice of Findlay to go the extra mile at the holidays!!    I walked up to the outside area where the BBQ was set up.  The aroma was fantastic.  The choices were awesome.  I had the BBQ chicken and the beans.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  WOW!!!  The BBQ chicken was tender and practically melted in my mouth.  The BBQ sauce, made from scratch at Jessie's, was incredible!  There are 4 flavored choices of their sauce.  Jessie Rae's BBQ is a MUST for BBQ lovers.  If you're not a BBQ aficionado you will be after tasting theirs without a doubt!!!  I truly recommend Jessie Rae's for any catering event.  I just know your guests will be pleasantly surprised!  The two servers/cooks from Jessie's were pleasant and enthusiastic.  I really enjoyed talking with them.  They were wonderful ambassadors for Jessie Rae's BBQ."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town!!! I porked in Vegas and it was amazing! Drove by and there was a line out the door. Had to stop in and it definitely did not disappoint!  Unfortunately we will have to be back for their ribs, which I hear is the best!"}
{"text":"WHAT HAVE I JUST EATEN?! Jessie Rae's is hands down phenomenal. It's no wonder they've won people's choice 2 years In a row. We ordered the Belt Buckle and The Duke.  The belt buckle had fries underneath that savory meat, and the Duke had Mac and cheese.  We preordered before coming, but when my boyfriend came to pick up they said the computer glitches and order didn't go through. It was a bummer BUT the guy at the register was so nice, he threw in an EXTRA order of food (another Duke), gave us a discount, and gave us a crap ton more God sauce. Wait, hold on...before I go on...that God sauce man. It was AMAZING. Basically liquid gold in my mouth. Ok, moving on. We thought it was great of him to really cater to us and make up for the mistake. Thanks so much guys!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible. I can understand why they are an award winning bbq joint! Workers were very personable, friendly, and provided excellent service. Can't wait to come back for more and more and more!"}
{"text":"You're better off heading to the frozen food aisle at your local grocery store. The WORST Mac n Cheese I've ever tried (1 bite was all I could stomach), tasted like the store bought, boxed, powdered mix kind, I think they must've ran out of their own & thought the box would suffice, AWFUL. Paid $2 for a 12oz glass of watered down coke, what a waste. The sauces were great but thats honestly the ONLY decent item I tried so I must admit I was shocked to see this place had 4+ stars. And No Napkins or Ketchup (which I specified in my order). Needless to say that I Will NEVER be ordering food from them again."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is amazing. I ordered the brisket and ribs and a side of Mac and cheese on my first visit here. The God sauce is a definite try for visitors.   I initially had a difficult time finding this place as it is located inside a saloon on your left once you enter. The staff is very friendly. I asked what I should try and they suggested I try the brisket and ribs. During and after my meal, the staff was courteous enough to ask how my meal was. I believe that's how you know they really care about the food they are serving. There's a bunch of food on the menu that I want to try on my next visit such as \"The Duke\" Fries which have pulled pork, melted cheese and a few sauces.   I'll be back ;)"}
{"text":"2 wkks ago we came for the 1st time and Daryin made our meal we got the double brisket and sausage sandwich is was delicious.  TONIGHT 12-20-16 WE CAME WE GOT THE BLACK COOK  AND GOT THE SAME THING IT WAS GREASY GARBAGE THE OIL WAS SOAKED THROUGHT MY BUN.   I don't know maybe he was upset because be had to remake the food IDK but it sucked tonight and the fries were limp not crispy like last time.    The only good thing about tonight the evening cashier is super nice with great personality we seen her both times!   Thanks Cashier"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Everything was delicious...I had the 3 meat with the hot link, pulled pork, ribs and BBQ mashed potatoes. Glad Yelp lead us in the right direction"}
{"text":"YO THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. I came here last Tuesday with my friends and the food was phenomenal, the lady ringing our orders was so nice and even took a photo of us. I am definitely bringing others here and telling people about this dope ass bbq joint"}
{"text":"Ok food, cold when we got it...we were the last people to be served so I will give them that.  The lady was rude, and trying to close up for the night."}
{"text":"Went for a bike  ride and stumbled across this gem !!!!  Service was quick and happy and the food was out of this world  I've been back 4x in a week and have told all my clients and friends to check it out  Yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"Outrageously OVERPRICED for amount of food! I catered in for 8 people which their package was $20/pp for 3 meats and 2 sides + tax and delivery fee- total was $176.00  I received 1 lb of pork ribs, 3 cut up sausages and 1/2 of brisket + medium packages of corn, mac&cheese + baked beans. NO WAY was I going to be able to feed our group. I called Jessie Rae's to inquire if in fact this was the correct package for party of 8 and to my surprise the owner said yes and then hung up on me!  NEVER in my entire catering experience have I ever felt entirely ripped off and upset with the response. PLEASE do yourself a favor and don't bother ordering from this place."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to come here seeing I'm from the barbecue capital (Memphis, TN). I'm so ecstatic I came here. The food was immaculate. I decided to get Ribs and Chicken. The food just melted in my mouth. On top of that, there's a lady who has the best personality and you confidence in their food. Was definitely a winning point for me. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to come here again and again!!!! Simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best bbq joints in las vegas, though the place is small, food is real yummy!! We had jive chicken on mac and cheese with waffle fries on the side. Loved it!! They also have god sauce, which is a must try bbq sauce, the best bbq sauce i ever had."}
{"text":"Talk about BBQ! We meet some friends that found this place through yelp. On a Monday night, we had pulled pork, ribs, hot links, Mac & cheese the tater tots !!!!!!! Everything was amazingly delicious!  We will deff return! Also Sam was very welcoming & had great service! You won't be disappointed, we will be back :)"}
{"text":"So we went here cause it was around the corner front the costume shop, it was kind of a wait but he was there by himself so I understood, we are gonna make sure we will get there earlier next time because he was out of a couple things we wanted because it was closer to closing time, let me tell you it was worth the wait, we got these loaded waffle fries and a hungry sized platter, it was so good I didn't wanna stop eating and we have great leftovers for the next day.  He was very apologetic about not having something's and made up for it by giving us sampler sides which was awesome, gotta try the smoked butter corn. We are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We were so disappointed we missed my wife's coworker friend's BBQ pop-up last week in San Francisco... so, we decided to look for a BBQ in Vegas. We're not disappointed anymore.   OMG! The best BBQ ribs we've had in years. The pulled pork just melts in your mouth... both were so juicy and tender. We actually didn't expect to find anything as good as this in Vegas, but we did. The sauce is what makes or breaks the BBQ and Jesse Rae's BBQ is the place for BBQ. As for the brisket, we prefer a little bit more marbling, but flavor was good. Just a little warning, they only have 4 tables. Suggest that you take out if the place is packed."}
{"text":"Tried the brisket, the pork, and the ribs, with four sides, and the 3 sauces. Brisket was good; pork was ok; ribs were weak. Whenever they have to lather the ribs in sauce, that ain't a good sign of the quality of the ribs themselves. This is more a brisket place than a pork or ribs place. The hot sauce was ok, the sweeter sauce was better. The vegas slaw and corn were decent; not so much, the mac n' cheese. All in all, ok, but not specular or memorable."}
{"text":"So, it was OK. The ribs were very small. More like baby backs and one order is only 3! Flavor was good. The sides were very good. Baked beans and kernel corn. The link sausages were nice sized but kind of on the dry side. The chicken, instead of giving you a half chicken, like most barbeque places, was diced, shredded and the amount of meat amounted to probably less than a full breast. I really wanted to like this place. The owner came out from the back, introduced himself to everyone in his restaurant and thanked everybody for coming but that in itself is not enough to get return business. I may give them another shot. Maybe. Maybe not"}
{"text":"Yoooooooo this probably one of the best BBQ spots in town. Spent about $25 each with a group of 4 of us. And the food portion is unbelievably large. Definitely coming back! \"The best part is the ass!\""}
{"text":"Place was super small,  the Groupon we bought was BS it says a 38 value when it only works out to be 28 dollars and the came out cold and the mac n cheese was easy over cooked along with my bfs ribs they traded more like jerky.  The bbq sauce one the other hand was pretty tasty.  But we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Over priced !  and food average  at best. Brisket  sandwich  all bread little meat. $11 bucks fries and drink extra.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Been living in Vegas for some time and Jessie Rae's is the Best BBQ spot in town!!! Try the Duke and the coleslaw !!"}
{"text":"WOW!   I have been to almost every BBQ place in Vegas and this is the best.  I thought I knew good BBQ before I went to Texas and had real BBQ.  Franklin BBQ in Austin Texas is the gold standard to compare all BBQ.  Jessie Rae's is pretty close.  The brisket was amazing.  Incredible flavor and super moist and tender.  Ribs were awesome and fall of the bone ready. Their sauces are homemade and fantastic. The Maniac fries are incredible.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had an awful experience at Jessie Ray's tonight. After making a rather large order, we waited about an hour before receiving any food.  Thankfully, the restaurant operates out of Cactus Jacks's saloon, which has gambling machines, darts, shuffle board, and more.  When we received our food the cook explained that he was sorry for the wait and that he threw in some ribs and chicken.  It wasn't until I looked at the order that it was just the ribs and chicken and not what we had ordered.  Here's where the four stars come in... I was irritated (clearly) and just asked for a refund.  The owner, Mike, happily obliged, and explained that they had run out of supply (which will happen at any good bbq place) and promised he would  take good care of me upon a second chance.   So here's the thing, bad stuff happens. I assume this was some sort of miscommunication and not a reflection on this business.  Also, the smell in there was unreal... I've had bbq in Texas hill country, Carolina, and all over the south.... And this smell was rival.     All is ask is some notification that there is plenty of product or none, and next time I'll call ahead.   Mike, I appreciate your honesty and apology, and I look forward to having you take care of me in the near future! I still have a bbq jones!  Everybody should give this place a chance."}
{"text":"The Best!!!! To be totally truthful there is not one thing wrong with anything.. Every single thing is so good. You could order anything and you wont be disappointed.."}
{"text":"Jessie rays is the best spot for BBQ in Vegas! I had the Jessie ray sandwich and it's soooo good! You must try it when you're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd pay soo much for fries but holy crap soo worth it! Mac n cheese, BBQ, hot links and sauce!! We split a portion and it fed us that night and the next day... I cant wait to come back and have some more"}
{"text":"Tonight was blah I had the 3 meat sandwich tonight was a brotha in the kitchen not Darren who did us justice last time. Food greasy fries limp and NO Sausage"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to this place and it was delicious. Its We will be coming back when we visit our son again. Thanks to my son for bring us here. I give it a 5 star. Carl and Cindi"}
{"text":"AMAZING service and food. I had the pleasure of speaking to both owners before they opened. I needed catering for a few large meetings immediately and on a budget. Man they did an amazing job! I have my Receptionist order from them every chance I get. The staff LOVES this place.   There isn't anything on the menu that isn't amazing! Great people, great food and great service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Cactus Jack's location yesterday to get some of the best BBQ I've ever had.  Hubby has eaten here quite a bit while on lunch at work, but this is my 2nd venture.  Loved it all.  1/2 rack of ribs, corn, bbq mashed potatoes.  YUM!  I ate two of the meaty, fall of the bone ribs and called it a day.  Took the rest home for dinner.  My husband had the sausage and brisket, both of which were super tasty.  The brisket was tender and delicious.  Mike, the owner, sat with us and BS'd for a bit telling us some of his future plans.  He has lots of great ideas, and is obviously ambitious and knows his food!  Great stuff. =)"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the location or decor, this place is incredible. Real bbq - the brisket is just melt in your mouth. Sides were perfect. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"Revised  7/20/2016  Well like I said the first time I went to this place it was awesome the second time it wasn't that great but I decided to give it another try and once again the food is awesome as well as the service I talked to one of the owners I don't know his name but he explained to me but they were going through a transition period and that was probably why my last visit wasn't that great, but as of right now thw food is awesome and I will defenetly will go back"}
{"text":"Had a friend tell me about this place just after it opened up last September (2015)... I finally got a chance to go this afternoon for lunch (I'm not from Vegas). Let me tell you,  it lived up to all expectations!   Very reasonable prices,  great combo deals,  lots of variety on the menu for a bbq place. Another customer ordered something called Maniac Fries and they looked great.   I ordered a two meat combo with bbq mashed potaoes,  and my buddy got 3 meat with house made mac n cheese.  I made sure to get ribs and pulled pork,  since any good bbq place should do those well.    The food was amazing.  Literally melt off the bone... And the sauces were great.  I can see why the \"God's Sauce\" has won awards.   I'll be back,  and would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Just had a great brisket BBQ sandwich with equally good slaw! Owner and hostess both very, very nice people as well. I will be going there often before UNLV basketball games as well as UNLV football games when they move to Raider's Stadium."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of great BBQ places in Las Vegas. To be honest, the best brisket in Vegas is in the Caesar's Buffet, which should tell you something. Jessie Rae's is a bit of a diamond in the rough.  Went for lunch, the wait was reasonable but the location is small. There are two picnic benches outside, but you probably want to grab an go unless you have the time.  The Duke and the Big Belt Buckle are both great served over waffle fries. Good sauce, decent meat to starch ratio, and a pretty hefty portion.  The sides are pretty solid as well, the corn is amazing, the green beans are green beans and the mac and cheese leaves something to be desired but is a solid dish for a colder day.  As most have said, the sauces are good. The God Sauce is amazing and has a great balance to the sweetness, the Fallen Angel is not for the faint of heart (if you don't say to people \"I like spicy\" don't try this sauce), and the Carolina style sauce should remind you of good East Coast BBQ (assuming you believe that exists).  Now to the most important part, the meats:  1. Brisket - solid brisket, sliced in relatively thick chunks. Good smoke development and usually a fattier cut (seems like the didn't trim off as much as other places to, the flavor thanks them for this). Not great bark though.  2. Pulled Pork - Another solid meat. The juiciness and the texture is what you want from a pulled port, very soft but not chewy. The flavor is somewhat lacking and probably requires sauce (not that you wouldn't just opt for the great sauce anyways).  3. Ribs - These are the best part. Honestly, they fall off the bone and taste spectacular. I got the three meat plate just so I could try the ribs, and the only thing I realized afterwards was I should have gone three meat just ribs. If you're a fan of ribs, you want some of these, stop looking at those sandwich options, get the ribs.  4. Burnt Ends - I'm really sorry to say, this is the low point of the menu. Not only is there a significant upcharge for the burnt ends, but they just aren't true burnt ends. Some places trim the bark and call those burnt ends, most places don't even try, the burnt ends here are just smaller pieces of the end cap. NO bark, NO juicy/fatty goodness. Do NOT fall in the trap of getting burnt ends (see above, just get ribs).  5. Chicken - Wasn't able to try the chicken, but if everything else is any reflection of the quality, this should be good.  Service: This was pretty excellent. The people were great and the food came out in a reasonable time.  Side Note: if you hop around back you can see a more traditional smoker and a pretty big Traeger. I'm willing to be that these key ingredients keep things pretty moist and flavorful. Big plus."}
{"text":"A lot of people will not like this place because it's small and off of the strip. But if you like barbecue and you want to indulge yourself while you are in Vegas, make a little side trip to Jessie Rae's. I love their pulled pork sandwich and barbecue chicken."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! So I was a bit scared because the place was empty but this is def a hidden treasure and totally recommended. Great customer service!!! Food is incredible and the decor inside is cute!!! If you are by any of their locations you have to try them out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We had bbq smoked brisket, spare ribs and baby back ribs! I loved the baby back ribs!! The corn is sooo good!! The bbq mashed potatoes are delicious as well even the coleslaw was super fresh and delicious! The corn muffin with some kind of sweet butter on top was so yummy! The girl in the front as helpful and sweet as pie! We will be back soon !! I forgot to go on about the Mac and cheese oh my god I could eat a tub of it !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular bbq.  The pulled pork sandwich was the perfect portion and it was delicious.  The sauces are original and very tasty.  Excellent experience, friendly staff, I'm happy customer for sure :)"}
{"text":"Located inside Cactus Jack's saloon near the intersection of St. Rose Pkwy and Maryland Pkwy.  My rating is probably more of a 3.5. I stopped in around noon on a Thursday. The bar was fairly empty. Was greeted by the bartender and given a menu. She explained a few of the options, and got me my Iced Tea.  Menu has lots of choices, I went with the two meat meal, sliced brisket and ribs with a side of smoked pork belly baked beans. Unfortunately the beans weren't ready, so they subbed in some mashed potatoes. A container full of napkins, to go plastic sauce cups, plastic silverware, and their 3 sauces was dropped off and I was ready to chow down.  They are famous for their God sauce, which is pretty tasty, a little sweet and smoky. When my food came out, the brisket, the ribs, and even the potatoes had God sauce on them. I think this is why I rated them lower than some, by the time I finished the taste of God sauce permeated my taste buds.   The sliced brisket was nice and tender. The bottom part still had a huge portion of fat on it....I think you should trim this before serving. The ribs were really good with that smoked flavor and moist as well. Both were pretty tasty on their own.  I'm pretty sure I'll be back. Henderson is getting a lot of BBQ places now with Jessie Rae's, Big B's, Tucky's, and Bell's. That is making it really hard to not eat BBQ every single day!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I had since I lived in Texas! Ive been here on 4 separate occasions and the food is always great! Portions are big, meat is tender and flavorful, prices are great, and customer service is always on point! I particularly like \"The Duke\" plate but the wings are great too."}
{"text":"I got to this place and picked up my brisket and pulled pork plus sides. Took a bite of each in the parking lot and said Wow this is good. Definitely recommend. I think my mouth watered all the way home. It didn't disappoint!  I recommend both the pulled pork and brisket and corn.  Pulled pork was my favorite."}
{"text":"The Duke with Mac N Cheese! Say no more. Every sauce is bomb especially the pig sweat. Support your local places. This place is bomb!"}
{"text":"Jessie Rae's BBQ is CONSISTENTLY GREAT!  The sliced brisket is always on point and the ribs are very good.  Wish they had sliced onions and jalapeños like the Texas joints I'm used too, but for legit Texas style BBQ they're worth the stop, plus they've added more seating."}
{"text":"So I tried this place on a crazy day( yesterday)  when they were running a 50% off promotion. We definitely stood in line and waited quite a while (almost an hour!) for food & ended up being able to take it home. Well let me say it was definitely worth the wait it was really good. We ordered a 2 meat and 3 meat combo. We had baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, Hot links & barbecue chicken. I loved all of the meat it was very well seasoned and cooked very well. Their barbecue sauce was good had a little kick to it. We ordered sides of the corn, mac & cheese, coleslaw and some corn muffins. The corn and mac & cheese were just average. Really liked their coleslaw and the cornbread was a little hard. All in all the barbecue food was really great and we will be back since it's so close to the house!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I tried to call and talk but the female kept talking over me not listening then I'm told I got extras. Extras of what? She complained when I ask about the God sauce I purchased extra of saying she made sure it was in there but gave me one which is the only extra I got. The man in the back said he gave me extra mash potatoes but received 2 which was what was ordered with sandwiches. I posted a picture of what they considered the 3 meat baby back rib tips brisket. I also posted what my other 3 meat looked like baby back rib tips and spare ribs. That one looked right then she says oh well credit you $10 then hung up. One combo was 22.04 and not even received. She also wanted to blame Eat 24 because they didn't have tater tots. Bad service all around. Oh a even worse the female puts Pepsi in the sprite and doesn't even fix it just hands it to me and says it's just a little bit my finger hit it. Maybe this place shouldn't allow delivery or pickup orders. Sorry you lost my business."}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ I've ever had . I got the maniac fries and some pork spare ribs. The maniac fries comes with waffle fries nice and crispy had Mac and cheese which was nice and gooey and had really good flavoring the hot links are so juicy and delicious . I got the brisket on my maniac fries and the brisket was out of this world super tender and you get some of those fatty parts which were my favorite . The pork spare ribs were very tender. I really liked the God sauce and their hot bbq sauce was great as well not too spicy but just right. My favorite thing was all of the meat was sooooo tender and juicy and i think that plays a big role in good BBQ . I will be back here again ."}
{"text":"Don't let the small storefront fool you, this restaurant is loaded with flavor and character! The brisket and pulled pork sandwich are perfection! I was too scared to try the \"Fallen Angel\" (made from the hottest pepper on earth) and \"Pig Sweat\" , the God sauce was perfect for every dish!   Don't pass this place up!!"}
{"text":"Now here's the thing, I'm not a huge fan of BBQ sauce but that changed the day I met God Sauce!  What is God Sauce you ask?  It's the best sauce ever!!  What do I smother in God Sauce?  Better question is what don't I smother in God Sauce...pancakes, eggs, tacos, spaghetti, salads, ice cream, my husband and of course Jessie Rae's amazing BBQ!    Jessie Rae's has won many awards and trophies rightfully so!  I don't eat pork but I make an exception while visiting Jessie Rae's!  The pulled pork sandwich...OMG!!!  The brisket, I don't even think I can put into words how delicious the brisket is!  The beans, the chicken, the ribs...the yumminess just goes on and on.    They just moved into their new location and renovations are being completed.  I can't wit to see the full menu.  Mike (the owner) is a BBQ Master! They officially open to the public on September 7, 2015.  Don't miss out on this finger licking' good Las Vegas Style BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Morgan and Staff for the great BBQ last night!  The BBQ chicken was fantastic as well as the slaw!   Definitely will stop back by for our next fix ..!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall, blink and you will miss it.  This is a no frills, no ketchup zone, so don't take it to heart but the service can appear abrupt and rude.  Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about the meat. The brisket was tender, juicy and flavorful and maybe a little bit of their award winning BBQ will enhance the flavor a bit more, though not necessary.  The rib tips, though a bit fatty, was again really tender and I expected crispy ends- but I must have mistaken.  I tried all different sauces that was offered and the award winning one tasted the most traditional and my preferred sauce. The belt buckle- with my choice of waffle fries and tots as my base, I was really disappointed that they were not crispy at all.  I did not enjoy any of the sauces that were laced over the dish, but I managed to pick out the brisket to get a better taste of it.  Next time, I'm ordering just the meat and skipping all the carbs including the sauce and adding my own.  The belt buckle reminds me of hangover food."}
{"text":"BBQ is my favorite type of food and I have been eating it for years. Ever since Pit Boss closed in Las Vegas several years ago I have been looking for a place like this. This place is the best small BBQ place in town. Forget about those other trash places like Rolling Smoke. Hot links were great, just the right amount of heat. Pulled pork was very good although a little bit too fatty. The St. Louis ribs are listed just as \"Spare ribs\" on the menu, but very good. The pork ribs are some of the largest pork ribs I've ever gotten, they are often too small for my taste. Their sauces are near perfect as well. Mustard based sauce is very good, ghost pepper BBQ sauce is good and not too spicy. Their normal sweet and tangy sauce is also extremely good, those sauces are often too sweet for my taste but this was spot on. Unfortunately they were out of mac and cheese somehow but I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Super good BBQ to brighten your day!!! This place rocks!! This was my first time in here. It is hard to find good BBQ here in Vegas. This place hits the mark!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my co-worker who took me here for the 1st time since it is down the street from our work.  I must say hands down to the BEST BBQ place I have ever tried.  It is a hole in the wall with not much seating,  but the food is amazing.  It can be a wait during lunch time, but let me tell you it is worth it!!!  I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with waffle fries.  It seriously was to die for!!  The portions are huge and I had leftovers for the next day.  The pricing is worth it for all the food you get.  You definitely don't get ripped off here!  I must say this place is #1 in my book and when family or friends come to visit I am bringing them to this secret hideaway.  Forget Lucille's BBQ or Famous Dave's!  This place is above and beyond!"}
{"text":"They make a delicious indulgent pulled pork sandwhich that will leave your mouth wanting more! Very filling. Also had the pulled brisket so good it makes you wanna smack your mama! Come check them out."}
{"text":"I wish i hadn't found this place on my last day in Las Vegas. I could have been enjoying this dank BBQ this whole trip! I opted for the maniac fries which were the right choice covering all the bases with fall apart brisket and covered in their home sauces. The entire menu looked delicious and the rest of the plates at our table were licked clean. The staff is incredibly nice and serious about their BBQ. I'm already looking forward to my next Vegas trip so i can crush some of the best BBQ I've had in all my global travels. 10/10."}
{"text":"I was having the worst day ever. I came to this small spot, but realized it just has so much more to offer don't let the size fool you! The Jessie Rae sandwich blew me away. The sandwich didn't have an overbearing sauce so I tasted the amazing rub flavor and the unique bread was some of the finest on the strip . The potato mash w Bbq sauce was ideal. I love potatoes with some of the skin left on so this won me over.  You can choose from either a god award winning sauce or fallen angel with the reaper \"hottest pepper in the world\". There's def something for everybody and I will be back. This is now my fav new Bbq place in Las Vegas! Thank u Jessie Rae your the best!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time and all I have to say is move over Rolling Smoke BBQ.  Jessie Rae's BBQ is #1."}
{"text":"Great food, comes out fast! Great place for a quick lunch. You can choose different portions depending if you want a light lunch or a heavy lunch"}
