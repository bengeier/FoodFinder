{"text":"Went last night for one of their VEGAN nights and my tastebuds were dancing. I wish I could go back and have it all again tonight!  It was a 3 for $30 and included a Grilled Caesar Salad, a Barbecue Tofu over a roasted sweet potato and this amazing grilled corn and edamame succotash, and this sweet little jalapeno cornbread, and then a strawberry shortcake complete with vegan ice cream to finish.  I have been a vegetarian for over 20 years, and have not had a great version of a Caesar until last night - Bistro 185 finally nailed a vegan caesar salad!   It was one of those meals where every other word out of my mouth was OMG. Thank you Bistro 185! Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I am often disappointed by caesar salad's around town, but not here, not too much dressing and plenty of anchovies in a chilled bowl.  Perfect, in my opinion.  I usually order this with the potato pancakes with gravlax, garnished with lemon, capers, sour cream, and cucumbers.  Very yummy combo."}
{"text":"Beer and wine prices are decent. Didn't have any food so review does not reflect that. Overall it's the obnoxious bartenders who try to display elevated understandings of alcohol and end up sounding rude and cocky versus educational and helpful. Overall an overated experience not worth the cheaper beer cost."}
{"text":"Ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, but as my mom said after dining here for lunch,  I'd rather they put the money into the food than the decor. We had a mediocre waitress but again, fabulous food. I had the pork special with a Chipotle raspberry sauce and sweet potato fries.My mom has been bugging me to go back and she is very finicky."}
{"text":"You can tell this is a chef run spot. The food was good, but the front of the house needs major help. Our waitress, Melissa, was rude and not attentive. I have dietary restrictions and none of them were met (e.g. Sauce on side.) She was not helpful and sloppy. I'm annoyed bc the food was good, and it's convenient location wise, but I won't be going back for a long time. PS. It was not cheap .. so we expected WAY better service. Blah."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive wait staff and the.best.salad.ever. It was the heirloom tomato salad,feta cheese,red onions over a bed of greens with wonderful balsamic dressing. Walleye was good, and special was ok too... Snapper. We had HOMEMADE pralines and cream ice cream. Delicious in spite of a grainy texture to the ice cream. The place looks like a local bar but have been there many times and it is always very good although it is kinda dark inside."}
{"text":"They did not honor the reservation. But we got a table and the food was good"}
{"text":"Great burger don't add any salt , pepper ketchup until you try it doesn't need anything. Bartender was super."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  Got the roasted Brussel sprouts for an appetizer and the steak oscar for dinner.  High quality fine dining.  My steak was not over cooked, I asked for medium and it was more on the medium rare side FYI.  Service was great and down to earth."}
{"text":"Stopped in again for Wednesday happy hour.  Great service from Richard, the bartender, and prompt turnaround on everything ordered.  Wednesday is burger night, so we had burgers, a couple martinis, calamari, and a salad.  One of our favorite neighborhood stops."}
{"text":"I couldn't get a reservation so just popped in to grab a bite at the bar. The service was fast and attentive, Ray the bartender was friendly and the food was excellent. Ordered the steak oscar and the single entree was enormous. The twin filets were excellent, the crabcake delicious and the golden mashed potatoes divine (and generously portioned). The physical space is limited, but felt cozy, not claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Great meal. The hot pot special could be reworked, but the stables we ordered were all dead on delicious. Also the pours were full and not too pricy."}
{"text":"So. We stopped on our way through town based on reviews. I think this place COULD be good. Depends on what you order and I'm not sure the descriptions really match the dishes. Over all it was way to pricey and the restaurant had a musty smell."}
{"text":"I try to visit this place whenever I'm in Cleveland.  It's small and gets crowded, so I would recommend arriving early or making a reservation.  Highlights include the charcuterie plate, the salad with goat cheese, the Coquille St. Jacques (sooo rich), and just about every entree. They have a standard menu and new specials each day. On my last visit, I ordered the short ribs Bourguignon and it was amazing. The meat was fork-tender and the sauce was very flavorful.  The chicken schnitzel is always a reliable choice, and the pierogies it's served with are awesome!   They have a decent wine list and a ton of beers on tap. The service is knowledgeable but casual, and they're always quick to joke with you or answer any questions you might have.   I'm usually too full for dessert, but last time our party shared a delicious strudel.  It's great to have this successful restaurant on the old 185 corridor."}
{"text":"We have dined here maybe twice a year over the last 5 or 6 years and look forward to each visit.  Something has gone terribly wrong.  Tonight we arrived at 6:30 to find a nearly empty restaraunt and waited for 5 minutes to be seated.  Once seated we waited another 20 minutes to place our order.  One waiter worked the restaraunt.  Our waiter didn't write our order but many fine restaraunt use this practice to take meal orders.  The waiter returned 10 minutes later to clarify our order.  Two of us ordered salads and small plates for our entree.  My husband ordered an appetizer and an entree.  The cheif came to our table to check on the order in which we wished to receive the items ordered and to inform us that the food truck didn't arrive and they didn't have potatoes which were order by 2 of us.  Oh well...we would live without the spuds.  The salads arrived and were fresh and delicious, but no appetizer.  We may have become cynical at this point but the main course arrived and was less than stellar.  We came to the conclusion it must be under new ownership.  Some fine meals have been eaten there and I what a heartbreak to see it's collapse."}
{"text":"Great place for cocktails and small plates. I love the quaint jazz club ambiance. It's perfect for casual fine dinning and good conversation. They have their own rooftop garden. I usually go for Martina's here."}
{"text":"A hidden Colinwood gem! One of my favorite lunch spots, I eat at Bistro 185 pretty regularly.  The food is excellent, and the staff is friendly and pleasant to talk to.  They do awesome homemade soups and rotating lunch special every day (Wednesday's brisket is the best).  The 185 salad is another one of my favorites.  If you somehow manage to save room for dessert, the homemade pies are good too.  I'm partial to the key lime, personally."}
{"text":"OK, let's get this straight.  I had the best pork chop of my life here.  It was the double cut pork chop, prepared in the sous-vide method, cooked for over 18 hours, a la cryovac.   The portion is a bit gigantic, so you'll have some for the next day.   :)   Based on this alone, it should be a destination spot for any restaurant aficionado."}
{"text":"Had the Asian HotPot. Wonderful flavors, don't forget to eat the broth. Staff (Barbara) was great, and was right about the Key Lime!"}
{"text":"Great little local restaurant pub  Highly recommend  Maybe the best home made desserts in north east Ohio"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews but the food at this place doesn't stand up to some of the praise I've read.  Dinner on a Sat. night, we sat within a few minutes.  The busy atmosphere didn't deter us, we were hungry and ready to eat.  The apps descriptions were wide and a great variety, we went with the crab & lobster beignets ($15).  Fried, good filling but sitting on a vinaigrette solution just ruined it.  Then came the mains, scallops wrapped in bacon ($25), just average, and sweet potato gnocci ($18).  I was expecting something light and airy, what I got were fried bullets, they were actually hard to chew!  Imagine!  I actually wondered how Jonathan Sawyer at his beautiful Trentina would have made this dish, let me tell you, completely different!!  It was obvious from my guest that the gnocci here at BISTRO 185 were previously frozen and then cooked.  It was a total disaster.  The spinach that came with it was good but AGAIN, more vinaigrette below the gnocci!!   I don't get it?  Don't believe the hype on this place.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour last week. They have $2.50 domestics,  $3 Dortmunder and $5 house wines. I tried the duck and the potstickers. The duck was way overcooked.  Don't look at their website for any information about happy hour deals because the food items listed on the website are not the food items available. There were only about 5 options available in the restaurant as opposed to the multiple options online. The restaurant is also very confusing because the website states that happy hour is from 4:30-6:30 pm but the hours listed on the outside of the restaurant state that they open at 5 pm. So confusing! Maybe it's an East side thing..."}
{"text":"The food at Bistro 185 is some of the best I have ever had. My Uncle Tom is a frequent visitor of this place and we meet him on occassion. The last time we were a party of 6 and let me say everyone's food looked and tasting outstanding. The portions are huge. My husband and I split a couple of things: the wild mushroom-topped salad was a large salad with several types of sauted mushrooms including bellas and shitake. They didn't skimp on the greens at all. We also got the Asian Hot Pot: tons of seafood including prawn-sized shrimp, scallops, white fish chunks, crab or lobster I think and shrimp dumplings, whole baby bok choy, as well as other Asian veggies in this amazing lemongrass coconut milk broth, Savory, spicey, super flavorful (not just salty like other places.) Others at our table got the pork chop which looked like an entire leg of a pig with all the fixings, frog legs on a bed of chopped garlic and herbs with olive oil... soooo good with the equally fabulous bread that was served to our table. We also tried the escargot and the muscles - yum. The seafood pot pie was served in a metal pot (slightly smaller than the Asian Hot Pot) and was full of seafood, peas, with an insanely rich cream sauce and topped with a big puff of pastry. We all got to try it and there was still way too much food left for my Uncle (but I think he managed) The wine list is superb, the desserts we tried were also crazy good (key lime pie and some chocolate-mousy goodness with ice cream topping, all melty) The food is absolutely worth the price, the ambiance is great, the staff was a great balance of unpretentiousness and professional and friendliness. The menu changes, I've heard so I can't wait to see what they will drum up next time I go... Oh, and even a vegetarian could eat well here; I saw a couple of vegetarian (pasta) dishes. Vegan? Maybe not..."}
{"text":"Had a weekend dinner here with my wife, before heading to the city for a theatre show.  This spot appears to have been an old-school bar / restaurant that was updated into its current bistro format.  The inside still has a certain old-world \"charm\" as you can see from the mix in décor in my pictures.  My wife and I chose to split a salad and went with their warm pistachio crusted goat cheese version.  It was easily shareable for the two of us, covered in a vinaigrette dressing.  For meals my wife ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops and I chose their fish fry.  My wife enjoyed her meal more so than I did.  I did taste her scallop dish and thought they were on the underdone side.  The two fish fillets on my plate were quite large, but due to their plumpness the innermost parts of the fish were underdone...and the overall thickness led to a poor ratio of breading to meat as each fillet fell apart as I ate it.  Lastly, the batter had an oily taste to it that was not quite appealing.  The side of fries and cole slaw were good...fresh cut fries and a creamy slaw were just as expected.  Our served was quite attentive and accommodating, just wish the food measured up a bit more."}
{"text":"Went for our first of the monthly vegan meals. The food was great starting with spring rolls and dumplings, followed by Mongolian barbecued tofu with brown rice an veggies, and finished with a chocolate torte that was to die for. Service was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is bar/pub like, relaxed and clean. Made sure we were on there email list for future vegan meals."}
{"text":"Service was great.  \"fine dining\" it says.  Nice candles.  Food was excellent.  The chef is supurb.  However...for a lovely up scale evening with our bill around $100..what's with the music??  Fine dining to \"great balls of fire\" and you ain't nothin but a hound dog?  I thought we were at a sock hop.  With everything else going for it, that stopped us from having another excellent cocktail, and leaving after dinner.  This great place needs some great dining music also."}
{"text":"It is a real shame whatever has happened to this place.  I used to be a regular, but after my last two visits I probably will never be back.  Tonight, went in for dinner with a friend, waited 15 minutes for someone to get our drink order in a house with 6 seated tables and at least 2 servers (there was a hostess and bartender as well).  The service was comically bad, everything took WAY too long, dinner was served with the explanation that they were out of your wine order.  When you selected a glass of something else it came out just in times for our plates to clear.  Shockingly no self awareness was exhibited, no embarrassment, at no time did any of the staff acknowledge our sitcom experience, it seams the new management fired everyone who had a clue and hired some younger \"fitter\" models that have NO FREAKING IDEA how to handle basic food service....   The duck appetizer came out cold (whether poor execution or our server letting the thing age a half hour before bringing it to the table I know not), the lobster mac and cheese advertised lump lobster meat and I struggled to identify the SHREDS of lobster sparingly present throughout the dish that was otherwise indistinguishable from most instant offerings save some crumbled saltines on top. Straight up; this place is a pile of crap now and I would not give them another dime of my money."}
{"text":"Great place for a birthday dinner. We had the charcuterie board, which was fabulous. The entrees were just ok. I had the lobster mac and cheese but was pretty full from the cheese board, so I could only eat a few bites. They comped dessert and we chose the salted caramel cheesecake. It was perfect texture and super delicious. My new favorite dessert! Next time I might just do the app and the dessert. This would have been plenty of food! It's fairly expensive, more than I remembered it from the past, but more manageable if you skip the average $30 entrees."}
{"text":"Very unusually creative wide-ranging menu.  Very nice, helpful, intelligent staff.  Parking lot too small but street parking is easy.  Don't leave valuables in your car, although this is a reasonably safe area.  The exterior looks like it's a dive, but it is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland.  You should make a reservation, since it is often crowded.  Not an upscale interior, but OK."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner at Bistro 185.  The menu is varied,  the wine list is impressive and the service is impeccable. The food is amazing.  The chef trained at the Culinary Institute of America in New York and it shows!   We had the bacon-wrapped scallops with risotto and the meatloaf with caramelized Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes.  Both dishes were delicious!  We also appreciated the great blues music playing in the background.  We'll definitely go back many times!"}
{"text":"Beyond horrific!!!! The service is lousy, and my order was wrong when I went there for dinner with my aunt. The chef offered to buy me dinner to come back. I planned to meet with him next week and write a favorable article about the restaurant for a local newspaper. I called him to make an appointment. The ASSHOLE who answers the phone treated me like garbage, hung up on me, told me he's not chef's secretary. I called back and asked when chef would be in and he said, \"Who the hell knows? That's the problem. I have other paying customers on the line so hurry up already.\" I told him to drop dead and hung up. I will NEVER patronize this establishment and any review I would do would be unfavorable. No apology. No nothing. Wow. Really? I have taken clients there and family members. I have brought them business and planned to go for lunch next week for a business lunch. This place will never see me again unless it's my middle finger."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch with some business associates and it was delightful!  Had the Bistro 185 salad with grilled chicken and while nothing extraordinary about the ingredients, it was a pleasure to have a salad prepared with such fresh ingredients and ratios (not too much or too little of anything!).  Hope to come back soon and explore more of the menu!  Only issue was parking - not enough!"}
{"text":"Bistro 185 is *still* an exceptional and delightful place for dinner, but make SURE you save room for dessert!!!!!!   The pastry chef is amazing and makes some of the most incredible desserts in town!  Every bite is fresh and pure- no canned fruit or imitation vanilla flavoring here.  Kudos to the dessert chef, indeed!"}
{"text":"Bistro 185 offers better than average entrees and a selection that is always new.   First off the place can be a little crowded on the weekends. Which means noise and not a lot of room to move around. But you are here for the food so on to it.    They offer a selection of seafood fare that seems inventive and rare especially in that area. Recently they began advertising \" a new dish every night.\" and they are seemingly delivering on that promise. That night there were offering a lobster and cream ravioli that looked delicious and also a crab bisque. The menu changes so ymmv.   I, having just had seafood for lunch, went with their cowboy rib eye steak. It was served with red skinned potatoes, and their fried vegetables.   For some reason they serve vegetables lightly breaded and deep fried. Not my thing at all. I actually like vegetables and I don't need them deep fried. My GF loved it though. The steak prepared to my specs, medium well and the portion was ok. potatoes were also plentiful.   The price was not there for me. It ended up being $35 for the steak and the side salad was extra.   Over all the food was delicious the prices and the crowd was not. The food is really well done here though so if that's not an issue, I'd recommend this place. I'm going to try it again on maybe an \"off\" night and I'll make sure I plan on spending $70 for dinner for 2."}
{"text":"Just a teensy little update here, kiddies:  Stopped in the other night with a few friends.   Beet salad with goat cheese. Sesame encrusted ahi tuna. Tempura battered carrots and green beans. Spicy noodles. Awww yeahhhh.   Portions are huge.   Beer was terrific. And trust me, I should know because I had about 6 of them.   Service was great.   Not much has changed and that's a very good thing. I still love The Beast. (Don't worry, that's an affectionate term.)"}
{"text":"Good but not great ... Francais was very good but lemon was overpowering ... If u love lemon you will like it ... The Francais at Players is better ... But food was very good"}
{"text":"We would go there at least  twice a month when the Levin's owned it, we would sit at the bar, have dinner and watch the Indians or Cavs. The food was good, the bartenders were friendly and the desserts were great. It was one of those real little places that are real finds.  We didn't know it was sold a while back, went there, sat at the bar, new bartenders, food was terrible , bartender was questionable, never went back. Look for another real find."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere: classy yet casual, and not at all pretentious.  You can either sit at high top tables by the bar or booths and tables on the other side (the whole place is pretty tiny yet there are two distinct rooms).  The owner and server were very warm and down-to-earth.    Onto the food!  They've got a pretty large and varied menu for an upscale-ish place, with every kind of meat and seafood you could want.  The mixed greens with goat cheese medallions was decent - large portion of greens and goat cheese with a nice dressing.  The romaine wedge salad looked good too.    The salmon with mashed sweet potatoes was huge and delicious.  The chilean sea bass with hollandaise sauce served over a huge slab of corn pudding was excellent too -- very buttery, but yum!  The accompanying tempura-style vegetables were tasty as well and brought a nice crunch to the dish.  The dessert menu is severely lacking in chocolate options, but the carrot cake I settled on wasn't bad.  The server explained that the desserts are made special from somewhere, and I'll take her word for it, but unfortunately the carrot cake was kind of cold like it had just come out of the refrigerator.  Cold cake never tastes too great and the icing was rather hard.  Nonetheless, the place is solid overall and I would definitely return if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Delicious. I went for NYE for the first time with a party of 14 and I didn't hear a single complaint. Portion size was huge and the menu selection pretty diverse with something for everyone. The Pork Chop and the Mac-n-Cheese were the two with the top rave reviews! They were out of a few different entrees but I'll give it to them...it was NYE.  Up next on my list of things to do...happy hour..."}
{"text":"This could definately have been a four or five star, but there was room for improvement on our first visit here. The menu is very complex and there are many changes to the menu at least weekly if not daily. The crab cakes were good but not great. I would say they were a little dry and maybe overcooked.  The entrees we had were amazing though. We had the lobster ravioli and the Bistro 185 Steak Oscar. The steak oscar was definately the best. Two beef medallions, a huge shrimp, a crab cake, tempura green beans and mashed potatoes. Good luck finishing that, especially if you get an appetizer. The lobster ravioli was a little rich and maybe a touch too much sauce but as a whole, it was amazing. It might have had the best scallops I have ever had. The shrimp were very good, but I would have thought they would have been de-tailed in a ravioli?  The decor and ambiance in the restaurant are nice, but there was no background music and the tables are so close together that it is noisy with conversation in there. And the parking is limited. The service was good though, very friendly people that work there."}
{"text":"Soooo this used to be one of my favorite places to dine and recommend, not so sure anymore.  I visited last night, and got there just after Happy Hour ended, so I decided to order off of the dinner menu.  I sat at the bar.  Richard, the bartender is definitely 5 stars! Always very attentive and welcoming.  I ordered the Lake Erie perch which was supposed to come with handcut fries and coleslaw.  My entree arrived, 4 pieces of perch, which were fried too hard, and had clearly been frozen.  Next to the perch was a mound of sauteed onions on top of pierogis and red cabbage coleslaw, in a plastic condiment takeout cup.  My entree was $20.00+, I expected fresh perch, and at the very least if they were going to use frozen fish, it should have been breaded, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Also there was never any mention that the fries, that I thought I was getting would be subbed for pierogis.  Although the pierogis were pretty darn tasty,  fluffy potatoey goodness, I was later told that they purchase them from a third party, Pierogi Palace (shout-out to PP!).  The coleslaw was a bit weird, red cabbage and capers....hmmmm.   The best part of my meal was the dessert which never ever fails. I opted for the key lime pie which is always fresh, delicious, and generously portioned.  This is the first and hopefully the last time that I have a mediocre meal here.  I will return, because I do love to support independent restaurants....hoping that next time will be better."}
{"text":"I've had better. It was good, don't get me wrong, but not great. We started off with the frog legs which were cooked really well but the sauce left much to be desired - bland and definitely needed salt. The bowl was full of all things wonderful and delicious: garlic, butter, bacon (or some derivative), chives, and walnuts. Should pack a punch of flavor right? Nope, nothing - so disappointing. I had the boeuf bourgignon which was the highlight for me. It was a little heavy for summertime but with the crappy weather we've had this August...why not? My friend had the lobster ravioli which again was good, not great. I'm disappointed that they can't seem to get their sauces right. This sauce had the consistency of a broth but was a cream sauce and certainly not suitable for a pasta dish. Scallops were cooked perfectly though.   There is talent here and definitely has the possibility to be great but not there yet. I will go again to see if they can improve"}
{"text":"It said fine dining. But the inside was more like a cozy dive bar. We ordered the vegan mac and cheese which came out luke warm at best. We were one of two couples seated at the bar none of us liked our selections. Definitely not fine dining."}
{"text":"We have been there several (maybe 7 or 8) times over the years, and it used to be better on many levels than it is now.  the last 2 times they totally screwed up our reservations--one time after sitting in the bar forever we left and went across the street to Muldoons, which was far less expensive and a great deal more fun.  The drink menu at Bistro 185 is top notch and fairly priced.  Food-wise the two signature dishes are the Duck and the Short Ribs.  The Duck is about the finest you can get in Cleveland.  Ask for it to be placed under a broiler for a few minutes before serving so the skin is crisp and the fat sort of separates from the meat.  The Short Ribs are served in a thick sauce and sometimes the meat is overwhelmed -- BUT the meat is always tender and tasty.    Make sure you take advantage of some of the special group dinners they have.  We did the beer tasting served with excellent sausages, cheeses, pates, etc. and a great main dish and dessert.  We really like this place--they need to take their reservations more seriously!"}
{"text":"Six of us ate there last night and everyone of us was very happy withour dinner.  The service was excellent and the dessert was to die for!!  Will gbo back often..."}
{"text":"I love Bistro 185. I came here early in Restaurant Week, making my reservation through Open Table. The restaurant is super easy to locate, right off the Shoreway & 185th. The interior is a little dated but don't let that deter you.  The service is spot on, the wait staff is extremely nice and helpful. The food, oh the food, it is so delicious. I had a Coquille St. Jacques (essentially scallops and shrimp in delicious cheese) as my first course, Pecan crusted fish with tempura vegetables and mashed sweet potatoes as my second, and the best key lime pie I have had in ages. My dining partner had a salad, some red meat and an amazingly delicious cheesecake (because we went so long ago I can't recall what she ate specifically). Both of us were so happy with our meals and we took most of it home to enjoy  We shared a bottle of sauvignon blanc.  This place is top notch. Their portions are extremely generous, that coupled with attentive workers left us satiated all the way through.   Great work!"}
{"text":"I had a nice business dinner here tonight. Shared appetizers across a small group. We have the calamari; stuffed dates wrapped in Bacon, and gravlax. All were delicious and uniquely made in house. Not the average and a step above. For a salad, I had the Cesar, but nothing special with it, and might choose another salad option next time. I tried my friends eggplant and spaghetti was really the star. A taste sensation beyond anything I have had before. My entree was the strip steak and again, it was not the best, but I could eat it and enjoy.  There is a desert display cooler and everything certainly looked great, but we all passed.  Oh, on the bar side; good beer selection and they make a decent martini. I will try this again because I think as I try and navigate the menu, I have enough precedence here that I am going to find several really good choices."}
{"text":"This place has a good bartender good server but horrible food. I had the Lake Erie Perch Fry that was tasteless. I reordered my meal and it came back with a pound of salt. The wings were OK but the truffle oil fries were not at all what truffle oil fries taste like. I won't return for dinner"}
{"text":"A quirky, cozy spot with some very good offerings.  You'll want to save room for dessert.   True, the new owner needs to work out some kinks, but still, the quality and portions are impressive and the atmosphere just right."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles are great. Duck is outstanding. They accommodate vegan options. Lobster ravioli was savory. Priced a little on the high side. Service is always great."}
{"text":"That may have been the best calamari I have ever had and there is no reason to not order the ahi tuna.  Pretty good selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is about 3 minutes from me, but sadly, I had never eaten here.  I changed this Friday night.  Again, I love the feel of the place, the neighborhood bar turned into high end dining joint.  We came here after checking out Thistledown for the Derby.  We had plans for later that evening, so decided to do appetizers and wine instead of a full on dinner.  For those of you who might look at the menu and be intimidated by the entree prices, this was a great choice.  We ordered 3 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine and our bill was 45.00.  Best of all, we were both completely stuffed.  As for the appetizers we got, I can not recommend the house smoked duck breast appetizer highly enough.  My dining companion who is a total foodie said it was among the top 5 dishes he had ever had, and I agree.  It was just PERFECT.  The smokey duck, the crispy potato pancakes, the sweet flavor of the cranberries, and the texture of the sour cream...I'm no food critic, but it was just the perfect combination of flavors.  We also got the crab cakes, which were....crab cakes. They were good, but nothing super special.  The third appetizer we got was the Coquille St. Jacques.  I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the combination of scallops and shrimp with the rich alfredo sauce, but I did.  It kind of comes out as a dip of sorts-it was very good dipped in bread but definitely rich.  We tend to preview places before we commit to a 100 dollar dinner there by stopping in for a drink and an appetizer, taking in the atmosphere and menu.  Based on our experience here this weekend, we will definitely be heading back for dinner.  I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Always the best. Love it here.  Fresh menu with daily specials. We come here often and we love it!"}
{"text":"I frequent Bistro 185 and shame on me for not reviewing before when I would be rating them 5 stars every time. The menu is spot on and atmosphere and service is always a nice change of pace for the typical east side establishments. But.... I am giving a 2 star review today so that maybe it will catch the managements eye. Service was slow, and had to be reminded several times, and it wasn't crowded. The sea bass was not good it was fishy and Texture was off, never should have made it to the table. Scallops also were not good and strange flavor. Maybe the kitchen was off? Maybe down some servers? The experience won't keep me away but I know it's under new management and the chef has put out excellent food in the past."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant on the east side. Perfect for lunch.   Cozy, not a huge place. Had the crab cake burger, really good . Service was okay. Parking was a little tight but close. I think it is def worth a try if you're in the area. Not hard to find at all."}
{"text":"This was out first time here and boy we weren't disappointed.  Our server/bartender was Amy and she was fantastic! We started off with a Jalapeño mango margaritas and the pork shank and mini corn dogs.  The Margaritas were incredibly tasty and the the appetizers were delightful.  The BBQ sauce used on the pork shank was sweet and tangy.  The mini corn dogs were amazing and served with house made chips and the BBQ sauce.  Our meals were the special.  Their version of the po boy. It was good, it had their beef spare ribs and the fries were delicious.  We took home two pieces of the lemon torte for desert later and we're told not only by our server but by the baker that it was divine.  We're looking forward to trying it. The atmosphere was great and the restaurant was clean and smelled good. We'll definitely be back. Amy was just awesome and we can't wait to try their homemade ginger beer."}
{"text":"So, last night I experienced some exceptionally bad service here. We sat at a high top by the bar and were hardly served from the moment we walked in. We were only given one drink menu and some flyer for father's day advertising specials.   When the waiter finally took our orders, he managed to get the appetizer and salad out for us, but somehow didn't get our entree orders in....and dinner took forever just for this reason. It felt like an hour of waiting between apps and entrees..beers were nearly gone before this point.   We ordered a field greens salad, which had candied walnuts, cranberries, goat cheese- this was delightful and just what I wanted.   Ordered the Gravlax appetizer, which very well could be a meal on its own. It was very heavy. I think they could really downsize the portions on this. Presentation was sloppy too. The flavor and the idea of it, I liked a lot. So if you've never had gravlax and are asking yourself what on earth is gravlax right about now, it's house cured salmon (using salt and sugar mix). Love this stuff. It was served over a very large potato pancake, which also made the whole thing a very heavy dish, and served with a side of sour cream and scant amount of capers. I think because it was so heavy, the potato pancake should have been downsized into smaller rounds, and more capers should have been on the platter? Just my opinion.   Then came my entree....not what I was expecting at all. I wanted something light, so I ordered halibut with mint pesto and orzo pasta risotto. Sounds impeccably light, no? So wrong. I swear that they used heavy cream to make this as it was quite heavy and not what my belly wanted at all. Also, I swear the fish on my plate was not truly halibut and actually some other fish...but how would they have proved me wrong? I didn't say anything. It tasted more like walleye or something or other, a lot less expensive. I know halibut is pricey and I know its texture...and it was not what I had on my dinner plate last night.   So, dinner was disappointing. I think I'm going to downgrade to 2.5 stars overall because of our poor experience last night."}
{"text":"I was in the Euclid area a week back for a licensing exam and a visit with a dear friend.  She recommended that we visit Bistro 185, a place she thought might appeal to my generally eclectic sensibilities.  It certainly is true that there aren't many places in my present residence of Buffalo, NY that can assemble a menu like that of Bistro 185.  But it's one thing to assemble a promising menu and another thing to deliver on those promises.  We started out with their latest flatbread, the description of which I cannot now find on their online menu.  (My fellow diner mentioned that she ordered a delicious goat cheese-centered one on her last visit, but this had apparently changed.)  I can, however, remember three key attributes of the offering.  First, for a flatbread, the weight of the toppings and cheese was surprisingly heavy, and the crust was accordingly unable to support this burden despite its relative thickness.  A fork was required, but the fork didn't make much headway against the plywood-like texture of the flatbread.  I attribute this failure both to the undercooking (and also underseasoning) of the crust and to the sheer volume of everything above.  Secondly, the cheese employed was of a surprisingly low quality, a tasteless gob of dairy fat.  Third, the caramelized onions were impeccable, juicy in each bite.  I'm not quite sure what it says about a restaurant staff when one item within a dish is perfect and the rest are either mediocre or terrible.  My takeaway is that the requisite attention to detail needed to support the ambition of the menu simply isn't there.  This supposition was thoroughly reinforced by both of our entrees.    My companion ordered a \"sesame crusted, pan seared, wild caught ahi tuna\" dish with \"wasabi aioli and ginger marinade drizzle, chilled spicy organic whole wheat peanut noodles, and house tempura vegetables.\"  Yeah, a mouthful. I do have to give them credit for deploying this concept dish, which was essentially, \"Let's make sushi a platter.\"  But honestly, this was a wild fuckup.  The ahi tuna was seared just enough to get rid of the delicious tuna flavor it sports in the raw and crusted with black and white sesame that both my companion and I found simply distracting.  The wasabi aioli was slight, so slight that only I was able to in fact discern it on the tuna.  (This is almost commendable.  If properly executed, this would have been a huge boost to the layering of flavors in this concept dish.)    The risk of serving lukewarm noodles is that they might clump.  These clumped.  Adding a sauce compounded the problem.  Unable to mix the tempura vegetables (mostly edamame and snap peas) thoroughly with the vegetables, they stood out like a sore thumb.  I could go further with what-if's on this concept dish, but the ultimate result was a clusterfuck that we both found incredibly disappointing.  I get that this is a concept dish.  I get that concept dishes don't always work out.  But if you are to add a concept dish to your menu, especially if it's rather expensive, you owe it to your patrons to ensure that it is high quality.  Before advancing to my dish, a note about the menu.  I appreciate the fact that so many different dishes are offered, but they seem to run into a problem here in that they do prep work for fewer portions of each, allowing them to run out quite easily.  Each of the first four items I wanted to order at 8:00 PM on a Friday (not that late) were sold out, and each of the next three I wanted were served with butternut squash.  Note 1:  Reduce the number of dishes you offer so that you can concentrate more on each!!  Note 2:  Think about how often you are using sides like butternut squash.  If we're talking about multiple entrees, that's a problem.  So as eclectic my tastes are, I wound up ordering veal scaloppini.  Short review:  don't order the veal scaloppini.  The casings of the wild mushroom ravioli were slimy.  The fillings of the wild mushroom ravioli were unforgivably bland.  The veal itself was overcooked to the level of the dog chew, exuding none of its natural virtues.  On the scale of ambition, this menu item ranks about a four.  Any Italian restaurant worth its salt will offer some variation.  Yet this ranks as THE worst offering I have ever had.  We didn't order drinks.  We didn't order dessert.  I will offer two other thoughts.  1) Our waiter, though attentive, demonstrated a poor knowledge of the items on the menu and the composition of each and could not answer our questions.  Also, in attitude and appearance, he could have stood in for the \"O face\" guy in Office Space.  Ugh.  2) The atmosphere of the place says, \"bar,\" not \"$30 entrees and ambitious fare.\"  Take what you will from that.  I don't live in the area.  But my companion does.  And after this meal, I doubt she'll be back either.  3 stars for atmosphere 2 stars for service 2 stars for food 2 stars overall"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband twice already. The first time I went I got their Caesar salad which was really tasty and the second time I went I also got the same exact thing because it was just that good. My husband decided to try their meatloaf the first time we went and he really enjoyed it. It wasn't dry and there was enough food for us to bring back home which is great for the price especially. I forgot what you got the second time around but he did enjoy it very much. The bartender which was an older male was extremely pleasant and very sweet. I like that he was constantly aware if we needed something unlike other places that we have been to where the bartender was having his own conversation with somebody else and would end up forgetting to refill your drink. The first time I went there wasn't anything I really enjoyed on the menu so he made a drink of his own after I told him what I was looking for and it came out really good. Very nice staff and a cute little spot. Their desserts are amazing! I love the keylime pie cheesecake and it was a big slice so it was well worth it. Bathroom was also neat which was great and they do have their own parking lot outside but it's a little small."}
{"text":"Family dinners can be  tricky with our gang.  Mostly because of the particular pallet of my husband and I, a plant fueled pair  juxtaposed some serious carnivores.   So naturally we're continuously looking for a place to please the hardcore veggies vs the hardcore meaties.    Bistro 185 : reservation booked.     I checked out website saw they have a vegan night so I figured they would at least \"have something\", but with curiosity & a slow day at the office I decided to call ahead to find out what was on the veg. menu for a random Friday.  The person who I spoke with was great, and not annoyed ... especially since I noticed when I was on the phone I was an a-hole, calling during the lunch rush.  I kept it brief, but he took time answering my question & even made note of the dietary restrictions on our reservation.    Arrival.    ... and my primary complaint... Parking.  They have a Lot, but it was full.  There is street parking but mostly taken.   We managed.  But I was really concerned when I saw a group of elderly doing Frogger across E 185th ,  there isn't much that can be done to solve this problem-- so take this as a heads up!  The building to me is classic Cleveland--mahogany bar, narrow building, booths & tables. Everyone and I mean everyone who worked there was friendly, and on the ball.  We were first to arrive, seated promptly, the waitress came over made introductions & made note of her awareness of the dietary needs and told us that of the selections the Chef was ready to make for us... which I'll get into in a bit.       They had a really nice wine list & a decent selection of beers.    I had one of the old vine zinfandels (it's been my summertime red)  it was very smooth   The Food. First off the menu is HUGE, exciting, and complex.    We ordered a smorgasbord of starters:  tempura green beans; warm mushroom salad; baked brie plate--highly recommend when you have a mixed diet group, it's loaded with nuts, fruit, crackers; Lobster Rangoon; and I think maybe chicken pot-stickers.    Everyone was happy w/ their dinner, portion size was generous, my sister in-law got the Bistro 185 Steak Oscar & had enough to take home.    I don't really know what everyone else got because I was so excited about my dinner!  I had a roasted Gardien chicken cutlet on top of veggies...  my husband had the cutlet over noodles w/ peanut sauce...  it was awesome!  It was so nice to go somewhere and have a solid veg meal, you could tell thought and care went into crafting the dish.  From my experience many awesome restaurants shame themselves by ignorantly slapping something together or not having any options at all.  (Ah-hem Southside brunch)    I definitely know we'll be going back to Bistro 185th"}
{"text":"Went for the clam bake & was a little disappointed. The lobster was good, but the broth they cooked the clams in was kind of gross. Also, they said that I had to prepay for the meal, which I did over the phone, but when I got the check they said that it was just to hold the reservation and blamed it on a new person answering the phone. Also, the service was terrible. Totally disorganized - no utensils then we had to ask for many things others that were participating in the dinner already had, like a bowl to place our shells. With ok food, poor service and the fee mishap like that I won't be traveling back to see their regular menu."}
{"text":"Great place on the far east side. Kind of a mix of a nice-you-should-take-your-parents-there place and neighborhood joint. Their regular menu has all the ethnic Cleveland staples (schnitzel, paprikas), and their daily menu has the selection of a far bigger place (like Chilean sea bass, duck and a freakin' awesome charcuterie appetizer plate).  I chickened out and got the Chicken Parmesan (wow, I'm so funny), but my five companions all got different menu items, and they all looked delicious. Plus, they have board games in shellac on their dining tables, so you can argue with your siblings about Monopoly all over again."}
{"text":"finished done and full  The mussels were the best  I'm not a big bread eater but dipping that crusty bread in the white broth was to die for  Not on the happy hour but still a great value  Great place in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday dinner here last night and have been here several other times previously.  Their food is always very good and service usually is too.  For cocktails I ordered a dark and stormy and I can't remember what the others ordered, but we all enjoyed them.  They also have a very good beer list and my husband says they have a good wine list as well.  For appetizers we shared the mussels in a wine sauce which were delicious.  I've also had them in their spicy marinara which were also fantastic.  For entrees, I had a mushroom pasta which was very good.  My husband had a couple of appetizers which he loved.  My aunt had the shortribs over cornbread which was enormous.  She seemed to like it, but my husband said after trying it that the shortribs at Flying Fig are much better.  Normally, we don't get dessert, but here we never skip it.  Their desserts are the stars of the show.  Their coconut cream pie and key lime pie are among the best I've ever had so we ordered both.  They were incredible.  Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything was terrific, the food was delicious. I got the chicken mac and cheese and my boyfriend got the bistro burger. The fries were amazing! The drinks were good. My only complaint is that the patio was smaller than I thought it would be but the service was fantastic and the food was good so it was a very plesasant experience, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Kind of pricey but always delicious.  I'm a big fan of the warm mushroom salad with pistachios.  And the monthly \"vegan\" night where a guest chef comes in to prepare a delicious vegan app, entree, and dessert.  (check out their website for more info)  The ambiance is interesting - kind of upscale with a neighborhood feel.  Overall, a place worth checking out if you're in the mood for a fancy pants meal."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices and a friendly staff-a neighborhood gem.  Tables are a little too close together and place is relatively noisy.  It's still worth a visit."}
{"text":"What. A. Find!  I came with a large group of friends while on a monthly business trip and we had the best time at Bistro 185.  The décor is sort of rustic, but upscale bistro with beautiful colored vases in the window cases that let in beautiful colored light into the dining space.  Service was impeccable from both the bar and table staff.  We ordered multiple appetizers and each had a different entrée and everyone loved their dish and the apps.  The menu was surprisingly varied and very  interesting (my best friend said that her watermelon gnocchi dish was DELICIOUS).  Personally, I am gluten-free and have multiple food allergies (Garlic, Onions, shellfish just to name a few), so dining out for me is problematic and very restrictive. I ordered the salmon and risotto and not only was it mouth-wateringly delicious, but there were multiple options on the menu for me, so when I go back (and I will go back for sure) I can try something else.  We ordered more drinks than I care to remember and all of them were consistently very good.  This restaurant is a find and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Come to Bistro 185. You won't be disappointed. Aside from the great food and wonderful beer selections, the atmosphere and the people you will meet will stay with you long after you have left. No worries. Just go back. You won't be disappointed.  Kudos to Vicki for the most amazing Carrot Cake Ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"The ladies that have previously reviewed Bistro 185 have done a really good job and they are spot on with freshness of the food, dining atmosphere, and the incredible waitstaff.  I go to Bistro 185 for their Happy Hour specials 4:30 - 6:30 pm Monday - Friday.  $5.00 per item, Available in bar area only     * 2 Pork Shanks with sweet and spicy raspberry glaze     * Asian Crab Cake     * Coquille St. Jacques (Shrimp and scallops in a Brandy Alfredo sauce)     * Bistro Sliders     * Potato Pancakes with sour cream     * Chef's Whim (Changes Daily)     * Selected Wines - $5.00 per glass  Guys, bring a first date here, your wife, gf, boyfriend, whatever....its a pleasant surprise especially if the significant other has yet to wine or dine in this restaurant.  You should get some bonus points, more then you would if the other option was wing night at the local dive.  Again, like a broken record, your only other option in this area that compares and that I can recommend is Grovewood Tavern but Bistro 185 is open for lunch.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service :) ps......best Keylime pie is the best around and I go there all the time because I know I'll leave happy and full :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night for the first time. Both the food and service were amazing! Barbara was our server and gave us perfect suggestions on what to order. We had the beet and goat cheese salad, the pistachio dates and the bacon wrapped scallops for an entree. OMG. The food was spectacular and Barbara took amazing care of us. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's not much to look at but don't let that fool you. Well made and thought out entrees. Service was very good and manager (or maybe owner) came by to see how everything was. I had the best pork chop I ever had, he said they came in last night to start smoking them. My only complaint was I could have used more of the pan sauce. My wife loved her salmon very fresh.  Her risotto was a bit bland but maybe that's because she ordered it without bacon. We split a Caesar salad and the tiramisu was freaking outstanding. The lighting at our table was harsh, like an interrogation room, but the owner explained they were testing new lights and they'd be switched out for softer ones. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and were glad we tried it because we'd heard so many good things. A credit to the neighborhood for sure."}
{"text":"I remember going there when it was Fritz's for beer and bowling.  Big menu variety and portion size.  There are always limited specials (but they may be out).  Quality is outstanding especially for the variety.  Good to go with several friends and each get something different.  Parking and happy hour menu are somewhat limited.  Can get a little busy and a little slow but never seems overwhelmed.  If you're lucky and they have Coconut Cream Pie, take one home for next day breakfast because surely you'll be too full to have dessert."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch and loved this place.  It had a neighborhood feel and the food was great.  It's small so I can imagine that it may be hard to get get a table on Saturday night.  I had a taco salad that was so flavorful and seasoned traditionally but different.  Hard to explain.  My companion had a salad as well.  I thought the prices were extremely reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Bistro 185 is a consistently reliable place to partake a fine dinner experience.  Tonight we sat at the bar and Richard and we exchanged many memories of Cleveland.  He also is an attentive server and made the night enjoyable. My wife had the salmon and liked it a lot. Our son and I had the carbonara which was tasty but heavier and not as delicate as carbonara we have had elsewhere. Of course we finished with a huge slice of key lime pie which was more than the three of us could finish. Go, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 7 for a birthday dinner (complimentary dessert for your birthday!). The restaurant has normal tables and a bar. The service was really quick, we ordered and didn't have to wait much for the appetizers, and then the entrees came as we were finishing up the appetizers. All seven entrees came out together, and hot. I had a pomegranate margarita which was really tasty. We got the mussels with lobster bacon herb sauce. The mussels were really tender, weren't chewy at all, and the sauce was perfect, creamy with lobster and bacon bits. I wanted to drink it, but I guess dipping the bread in the sauce was a more respectable way to enjoy it. We also got the charcuterie board, which I enjoyed, there were two cheese, two meats and some jams and fruit and pickled peppers. I'm more into cheese and meats so I was hoping for more of those, but I guess this was a good variety. I got the bacon wrapped scallops, which came with a lobster risotto with asparagus and sundried tomatoes. The scallops were very tender and flavorful, and the bacon was just crisp. The risotto was very tasty too. And I had the tiramisu which was great.   TLDR: Everything I ate was great and I enjoyed it and I'm kind of picky about how I like my food so that's not how it usually happens. Food came out in great timing for our entire group, didn't have to wait and get hangry. Would come again for sure."}
{"text":"Love this little Gem!! The staff is on point always happy to see you and they offer the best service! Let's not forget the food... delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great great happy hour.  We stopped here for the happy hour. My friend mentioned to me that it was a great happy hour..I entered after him thinking in my head \"where are we?\"  We sat down at the bar and instantly was friendly. He made me a Tina Louise drink- I, of course, am too young to really even know Gilligan's Island, but it was true to its name- a ginger vodka with honey and I think it was papaya or mango juice? Nonetheless, it was GREAT. I love it when they make their own specials drinks.  I looked at the menu and was wowed by the choices. Whoa, those are on happy hour....and they're THAT cheap? No way. So we splurged a little bit:  - Pork shanks with raspberry glaze- omg, it was tender and oh so good. I highly recommend it.  - Asian crab cake- meh, they were good, but not amazing? I don't think crab cakes should be Asian.  -Coquille St. Jacques- Mmmmm. that was definitely a hit. Shrimp and scallops? mmmm.  We got other items, that which I can not remember. I just remember everything being good, high quality, and CHEAP. Wow. Definitely a hit for happy hour. It's kind of in the middle of no where, but man, the food was good. What a hit."}
{"text":"Finally made a commitment to have dinner here and I could kick myself for waiting so long. My wife and I decided to head there for dinner. Made reservations on through their Yelp listing, which tired me into my  Open Table app!! Nice link!  Arrived few minutes ahead of our time and the hostess,  Kia quickly took us to our table, but noticed a corner, more intimate table was opening. She asked if we didn't mind , she would get it at and we could sit there! Perfect suggestion!  We were told our server was be Stephanie and what a joy to really be served! Steph was quick, attentive, and had every detail covered. Took our drink order and asked if e were going to order an appetizer which we did; the calamari! Having a wife who is an excellent cook and a trained chef son, this was the best calamari I've eatened. Thick, moist pieces not overly deep-fried, were served along two dipping sauces. If I had four thumbs, I would give it for thumbs up!  My wife had the bacon wrapped scampies on a bed of rosito, while I ordered the Veal Marsala. Both dishes were served quick and pleasantly hot, which just enhanced the flavors of both plates. My wife said the scampies were cooked to perfection and the bacon wrapping was juicy and had just the right crispyness to enjoy with each tasty bite. She highly recommends this plate.  It has been a while since I have had veal marsala, but tonight I was thrilled to attack this plate!! The veal was tender and easily cut by firm, with out the need of a knife. Two good size pieces, served with three nice sized raviolis and shitake mushrooms. An Outstanding Plate!!  Never would have guessed we would have such an outstanding meal right here in Cleveland!!! A MUST TRY SPOT FOR THE NEVER HERE BEFORE.  Finally, not often I say sit in a certain servers area, but at Bistro 185, by all means possible, get Stephanie as yours! She added a professional touch to our night out dining!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, nice presentation. All five of us enjoyed our first time experience. Definitely on our return list!"}
{"text":"I had the Reuben Egg Rolls, Mussels in spicy marinara, and Veal Marsala. The egg rolls rocked however the other two were very unimpressive. The Mussels were kind of cold and the marinara wasn't even the slightest bit spicy..the Veal Marsala I found to be very bland.  If I were to ever go back I would just get a drink and egg rolls but I don't know if it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Although the menu is vast and has a lot of choices, some items need a little work. Especially the cold sesame noodles with the sesame ahi tuna.  Flavor ok, but need a better choice of noodle...udon or even linguine would be better.   The tuna was cooked perfectly....rare. And flavorful. The best thing about the Bistro, hands down, is the hand cut tempura calamari.  It is like BUTTER!  Best in Cleveland.   We chose this spot for new years, just for the calamari alone.  But service was a bit sketchy and a little rude."}
