{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! First off, while I'm having a conversation with my husband (not loud at all) I don't care for an over-dramatic, ill-educated and condecending bartender telling us to \"tone it down or leave\" because we are apparently in a \"family establishment\" despite no one under 21 being permitted in the hermetically sealed bar area. Secondly, for us just moving to the area and not knowing many places to go, this smokey dive bar with its narcissistic \"boss lady\" bartender Megan (obviously in dire need of attention) clearly lacks the fundamentals of management, as is reflected in the overall level of service. If you're looking for a good dive bar, I recommend you raise the bar and aim higher than this tweaker infested ashtray of a watering hole. Your lungs will thank you!"}
{"text":"Pretty hilarious that you have to watch your language in a bar for 21 and up only but whatever.  This bar isn't in the best location,  Boulder Highway has lots of transients and this location is no exception.  The food, bartenders,  and atmosphere is barely average.  Wouldn't suggest it to friends, family, or anyone else"}
{"text":"I have only been in here once so this may not be a fair review. Came in around 4 PM and asked about happy hour specials and was told they didn't have any. Ordered a Bud Light longneck and they charged me $4. I commented that was pretty steep especially for a bar so far from downtown and was told i should have ordered a draft that it was a better deal. I guess i could have been told that from the beginning but oh well. Nothing exciting about the inside. Just a typical dark smokey bar trying to pass itself off as an Irish pub. I didnt try the food but the menu was typical pub fare with nothing really standing out. I dont see myself ever coming back to even rate it or give it a second chance."}
{"text":"We always eat on the family side and have always had a fantastic experience. I highly recommend their wings with the \"Jesus\" sauce, amazing! Just make sure to get an order for everybody who wants in on some."}
{"text":"Five star pizza... WOW.  That's all I gotta say.  The peanut butter BLT was not my cup of tea.  The fish and chips were pretty good.  The pizza though, my gosh."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to stop for a drink after an event at Sam Boyd. The bar   Looked busy with a lot of people. Looked like a cool place. We ordered a couple drinks and the bartender brought us two waters. We thought he was giving us something until he brought us our drinks - nope. We had to call him back over because we couldn't get either bartender to stop to talk to us. We asked him why the water and we were told we were being rude, we were there 10 minutes and only talked to each other! Next thing we know, Metro is walking through the bar! They called the police on somebody! We did not hear or see anyone being out of line. What the heck is wrong with this place? The bar emptied out within 20 minutes of us being there. There was only us and two other people. One of us asked for hard apple cider and was told they didn't have any. Even though we just saw the bartender serve it to the girl two seats down! What is wrong with this place? It was like the twilight zone! I have never seen a bar that was so rude to customers. My advise ... Spend your hard earned money someplace where you won't be treated like an inconveince."}
{"text":"Bartender & waitress nice food is ok ;) !! Good prices not best area but it's ok first time here !! My fiance seems to like it he loves his beer !"}
{"text":"This is a great little bar with a family restaurant attached. The food is great and the service fantastic! Megan is extremely nice and very attentive!  The hamburgers are very juicy and flavorful,  the turkey melt is delicious!  And they have Gamblers Bonus!"}
{"text":"We came here twice and loved it both times!  Meghan and Cheryl are some awesome bartenders!!  The food is awesome what more can we say!!!"}
{"text":"Try the Black and Bleu Cheeseburger... Food is always cooked perfectly. Friendly staff, clean and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great bartenders! The nachos were a great snack to munch on. Pretty relax vibe, great spot to grab a bite and drink after work."}
{"text":"I love this place I come here a hell of alot. But it has never payed out for me I put in 480 bucks played over 500 and got nothing.. very disappointed in the machines"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The atmosphere was cool, our waitress was charming and delightful, and and the food was really good! The only thing I would mention that was a teeny bit of a disappointment was the search I used was for \"Irish Pub,\" and there wasn't much in the way of Irish choices on the menu. But the restaurant itself made up for that, so I give it all the stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drinks, friendly service, and nice atmosphere.  Love it. Will be coming back on the regular."}
{"text":"We love mulligan's!  The food is great and Megan always takes care of us.  The chicken quesadilla is amazing and so are the chili cheese fries and nachos!"}
{"text":"My wife and I moved here from Scranton, PA, a place where neighborhood bars are the order of the day.  We wandered into Mulligans last summer as it was very close to our condo and were pleasantly surprised.  In the course of the last 10 months we've NEVER had a bad meal  here, the drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders, Megan & Jonas, greet us every time we come in and have our drinks on the bar before we sit down. The PA neighborhood bar experience indeed, we love it."}
{"text":"i am the daughter of a 22 year career air force retiree. #godblesshissoul.  i live near & decided to enjoy a late lunch. i look younger than my 28. so of course the bartender asks for my id.  i hand her my usa passport id card. a valid government issued id, to be accepted everywhere. on my passport id card, it says: nationality: usa  placeofbirth: california, usa  & birthdate prominently centered in black ink.  mrs. megan/meghan asked if i had my passport book, i said no, she said she couldn't accept my passport id card. & only allowed to accept passport books.   i asked to see the policy in writing. as my usa passport id card is accepted elsewhere i patron. she said we don't accept passport id cards. i said okay, well i want to speak to the manager. apparently she happened to be.  i asked if she was the general manager? she said yes, i am the bar manager.  i have the right to refuse service to anyone. i am refusing to serve you. i asked her, why am i being denied service when i gave you proper identification? is it because i asked to see the company policy, & wanted to speak to management?   as our entire conversation was spoken calmly. i had no intention of ruining a great day, by her escalating it, if i tried to patron here further.  i told her i will be contacting corporate about this uncouth service. & that's when i asked for her name. a manager should know how to treat customers & keep business.   if this is company policy, a sign should be displayed visibly for patrons to see. if i was shown company policy i would have given her my ca state drivers license. since it is not displayed. when i asked megan/meghan to see the company policy, megan/meghan should have provided it. if megan/meghan had managed the task of customer service & represented company policy w/skill & integrity. i would not have felt the need to take 3 hrs to complete this review. this event occurred between 3-3:05pm 6/27/2018.  her description: bouncy black long hair, 5,5 or so, curvy body & small eyes.  ps: corporate/ownership is not found. if the owners/corporate let renegade management speak for their company w/out policy evidence that is bad business.  my daddy served for american citizens & i'm still appalled & hurt they would treat veteran family members like this."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and stopped in on a Monday afternoon, and it was packed with \"regulars\".  The bar staff seemed very friendly and attentive to everybody else, but made me feel like an outsider intruding on a private party.  My glass sat empty for quite a while before I finally had to flag someone down for a refill, twice.  Same for getting a food menu.  Reasonable prices and decent food, but the lack of proper service will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"I've been in Henderson/Las Vegas again now for 7 months. My office is close to this place so I chose to move over here so that I could either have a short drive or just ride my bike. I had driven by this place many times and finally decided to stop in one night since I didn't feel like cooking or cleaning up. I had a few hopes of finding some place near me that I could hang out in every so often, but all hopes were dashed.   I'm sure most people around here are use to the indoor smoking thing, but I am not and find it disgusting, though I knew this would be the case going in so I tried to find a spot away from everyone else. I'm sure you'd ask why I didn't just go sit in the dining room, but I was alone and I feel stupid sitting at a big table by myself. Plus, typically dining rooms don't have tv's so I'd just be sitting there alone and bored. The bartender finally came around and I got a Maker's on the rocks. I'm seeing a trend in this area that Maker's is as  good as it's gonna get.   Looking through the menu I finally decided that nachos sounded good and were safe. Boy was I wrong. First off they drench the bottom of the plate with refried beans so you get this sopping mess of soggy chips in the end. Not sure how they managed it, but the nachos them self were boring as crap. The chicken was dry, the ingredients seemed bland, and really I only ate them because I was starving.   The atmosphere was ok, but really it was just your typical smoking rednecks of Hendertucky. Seeing that it's across the street from my apartment, I wish I could say I would go back, but I highly doubt it. I was just terribly underwhelmed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"I've lived in the surrounding area for 4 years now and never once thought about stopping in for a drink. I've seen their sign advertising various specials and events, but given the crazy people that congregate around the bus stop nearby, I never wanted to risk going in and dealing with crazies.  My friend told me to meet her there one day after a softball game. My softball buddy and I went there and she met up with us later. We were hungry so we ordered some food. He went with the BLTAPNB which is a standard BLT with Peanut Butter. Seemed odd, but worth a shot. I went with the more than a turkey melt sandwich which has turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, garlic butter, and Cajun mayo. We split both sandwiches and they were OUTSTANDING!  The prices were affordable too! Onion rings were good, a little on the undercooked side where the whole ring comes out of the breading, but whatever. French fries were cooked perfectly.  Beer is reasonable, both draft and bottle.  The only thing is, if you don't like a smoky place, this may not be the place for you. HOWEVER, they do have a small seating area/restaurant area that is completely closed off from the bar with glass partitions so that may work for you if you want something to eat.  Bar staff is friendly, and this is definitely a neighborhood joint where if you visit enough, they'll get to know your name and drink of choice.  Have been back multiple times now and planning on going again."}
{"text":"This place is a nice hang out place. It offers the basics a bar should have and despite being in a sketchy area and locked at night (you must be let in) it feels cozy and clean. I had a bit of a mix up on my order one time where the server was confused when I wanted a warm apple jack and instead tried to give me tea with whisky in it. haha. The pizza is very cheesy and good to share. Overall it is decent place to get a drink and bite to eat."}
{"text":"We visit Las Vegas 2 couple time a year. In 2017 we stayed at Siena Suites and were pleased to discover a pub/restaurant right next door. The staff was friendly and efficient and the food was great. April 2018 we again stayed and Siena Suites and ate most meals at Mulligans. They serve a great breakfast, the only near by place to get breakfast early, and have specials at affordable prices. We are traditional breakfast lovers, hashbrowns, eggs, bacon and toast. 3 days in a row our breakfast was wonderful. Cheryl and Pauline took great care of us and keep the coffee coming.  We also had dinner twice. the first night we both had a burger and onion rings. Our last night in Vegas I had the Cobb Salad and was able to customize it to my dietary needs, my spouse had the fish sandwich. Both meals were excellant.  The waitstaff in the evenings were very friendly, appropriately attentive and efficient. We also benefited from a discount for being a guest at Siena Suites which was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"I don't drink or I may never leave this place. I either get food and eat at the bar or food to go. They are always friendly and I have a good time. I have to say you need to try the pizza burger..YUM!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  I took the whole family since my daughter wanted to try blood sausage.  It was fabulous!  The whole atmosphere was exactly what I wanted.  My semi-adult kids loved everything about it and toured the whole place reading signs, pictures, etc.  Truly an experience.  As to Malachi's review of 1 star because he couldn't drop F-bombs-pathetic.  But, if your intelligence is low and those are the only power words you have, I suppose that would be disappointing.  We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This place always takes good care of me. I have been a customer for several years. The BLT with avocado and peanut butter rocks!!!"}
{"text":"The Place is nice the bartenders are good at there job descent food and separate smoking area"}
{"text":"Great bartenders. Ice cold beer. Good food too. I love their club sandwich. My guy loves their burgers."}
{"text":"The manager sucks at this bar!!!!   You are not allowed to have fun at this bar.  If you don't gamble they don't care about you!  Never Again!!!"}
{"text":"When I first decided we were going to move to Vegas, I told my fiance I would not become a degenerate gambler. Apologies to those who are, because I am thisclose to becoming just like you and am proud to do so at Mulligan's.   First, Jocelyn is the best bartender. I love her, her bangs, her personality, her everything. She is one of the top bartenders we've ever had and she makes our experience at Mulligan's 100 times better whenever we go (which is not as often since we're attempting to save up for our wedding...oops...VEGAAAS!). She works on the earlier shift, so see her then (e.g. football games).  Second, my fiance has won two royals there since we've moved to Vegas which has not been more than two years yet. That's saying something, but I'm not sure if it is about him or the looser slots? Let's go with loose slots. They have fun games and great incentives if you hit 4 of a kind, a flush, etc. You've got to appreciate the perks my friends.  Oh the food. Oh, yummy food. I could eat that $3.99 breakfast special any time. Two eggs, hash browns, two pieces of bacon, two pieces of sausage and one very large pancake. $3.99. YES PLEASE! We would go to Mulligan's after the fiance's graveyard shift, get the breakfast special and then drink, I mean gamble, I mean, talk to Jocelyn and act like respectable citizens. I love the atmosphere and the darker pub feel, especially since clubs and dance beats aren't really my scene anymore.  The Caesar salad no croutons with chicken? Hands down on the of the best Caesar salads I've ever eaten before. Huge portion, lots of delicious grilled chicken, they go somewhat easy with the dressing so I don't realize how many calories I'm consuming and oh yes, it fills me up for longer than an hour which is not normal with me and salads. Delicious. I want it almost every time. My fiance also loves the nachos and says they aren't too weighed down with cheese that ruins your meal with its greasy nature and the chips and light and crispy. He loves their nachos more than El Segundo Sol which is definitely saying something.  So go to Mulligan's for a nice relaxed time, no drama, just drinks, a little video poker, some sports and maybe you'll even meet some new friends to do all of the above all over again the next day. Great place."}
{"text":"My friend & I go to this bar after we hike by the Silver Bowl, it was packed with UNLV & Boise peeps yesterday! We got there before the crowd, wow I have to give tons of credit to the bar tenders they did not have a moment to stop. The bar tenders were so busy but they were so nice smiling and doing the best they could. We always go there after a hike in that area because they have the icy coldest beers on tap in town! That means there cooler is CLEAN! Every thing we ordered was so good, the atmosphere is clean and comfortable! Our Favorite, after a strenuous hike :)"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find in Mulligan's for breakfast.  $3.99 for two eggs, two bacon or sausage, toast and hash browns. Prepared just how we requested. No sending back here. And super clean. No sticky salt and peppers at Mulligan's. Nice dining area. And Lilly is a top class waitress. Such a relaxing and pleasant way to start your day. The $3.99 price is good till 11:00 btw."}
{"text":"Cozy, friendly and fun. Great menu with lots of variety. Everything l have tried has been very good. The burgers are better than average. Caesar salad is excellent. All the bartenders are friendly and attentive, especially Cheryl. She makes a nice cocktail, delivered with a smile. Open 24 hours. Breakfast starts at midnight. The music was at a nice level, not too loud. Great song choices, a little something for everyone. Lots of TVs with sports on every channel. The only thing l can't recommend are onion rings. I consider myself an expert on onion rings. Theirs are definitely frozen. Everything else is great!"}
{"text":"Rhonda is our usual server. She is amazing, we get fast service and good food. Best server"}
{"text":"The good: food is pretty decent, it looks like they recently updated their menu. The chicken cordon bleu was phenomenal. Definitely would come back for the food. Our food took quite awhile to get here, and the bartender took off our two beers and iced teas off our bill.   The bad: the over all hygiene of the bar tender, he sneezed multiple times and never washed his hands. He got a little bit of whip cream on his hands and licked it off after he set the plate down. But the worst was when he was smoking while behind the bar serving food.  Overall: this is close to our home, so we will come back. I'm concerned with the overall cleanliness of this establishment."}
{"text":"I live in the homes nearby. This is not a great area in general but a lot of nice homes have gone up and there is nowhere decent in the area to go for drinks & food... except Mulligans. The drinks are made right, reasonably priced with quick service. The restaurant has great burgers and sandwiches at reasonable prices. The staff has always been friendly and efficient.   My complaints are:  1-Bar is SMOKEY! but the restaurant is not at all, I've brought my teenage boys in there with no worries (they love the burgers) 2-The constant cursing reminder. Stupid, are we 12? It's annoying to be interrupted in middle of a conversation... at a smokey dive bar... for cursing."}
{"text":"We went to the Pub for St. Patrick's day. Outstanding Corn Beef and Cabbage! Service was fast and polite. Green beer was icy cold! Place was very clean. Bar is separated from the dinning area by a glass panel. This allowed you to view the crazies in the bar but not get any of the smoke! Topped the diner off with fried Oreo's!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, good ambiance,and options to sit in a nonsmoking environment if you wish so. They make awesome burgers, and we also love the Cesar salad. The prices are affordable and the portions are large. We love this place, it is certainly a hidden gem on Boulder Hwy."}
{"text":"Moved to Vegas recently, finally found my way over here and I'm glad I did!  Megan, the bartender, is amazing, friendly, and quick.  Put a couple bucks in the poker machine and ate some food.  I had the chicken parm and my girlfriend had the taco salad.  AMAZING.  The put a piece of ham between the Parmesan and chicken, wow.  I need another just writing about it.    Only drawback is every $10 you lose on the machine equates to one comped drink.  Should be free while you play, but being the area that it is in I understand.  Every patron I encountered were nice as hell as well.   And as far as the cursing, everything goes but \"F*ck\". So, who cares.    I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"We decided to check this bar out last night after a football game, so of course we were a little riled up.  We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza - the sauce was good, but overall it was okay.   While waiting for our food, the bartender asked us (along with a few other patrons) to watch our language... What?!!  We're at a bar.  Everyone is 21 and over.  Can someone please explain this to me??    So instead of staying longer, we took our business elsewhere - where we could gamble, drink, and curse without getting scolded."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood establishment. One of those places where \"everybody knows your name.\" Good food and good beer selection too. I'll be back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was dry and flavourless....This was the second time we tried getting takeout... Won't order again..  thought the first  time we ordered was a fluke and decided to try again...  No thanks"}
{"text":"This place is your standard pub atmosphere. kinda dark. If you enter on your left you enter the bar. IF you enter on the right it is the restaurant. I myself have yet to enter on the right hand side. My bf and I came here when we had 2 NFL games to watch. I ordered the buffalo wings eventhough I was dying to try the hamburger b/c I saw another person who had just received their order @ the bar. The wings were good but not to die for or anything. Well since we had been there since 10 am... and here it was 4 and we were still there watching our games we just went ahead and ordered dinner. I ordered the cheeseburger and it was really really good.  On acouple of other occasions we came here for HH. well it wasnt so happy b/c the prices were kinda high compared to other bars in the area (for mixed drinks @ least for happy hour prices. I dont think I'd come back here for just happy hour but I would come back for that cheeseburger or the wings. ..but its just hard to come here for wings when BWW is just 5 min. away."}
{"text":"Although from the outside Mulligan's appears to be your average local Irish style pub, the food is way above average and the service is always great.  Seriously, the philly cheesesteak sub is the most satisfying late night drunkin meal one could ever imagine.  Whether they are busy from UNLV game crowds or dead in the wee hours of the night/morning, they are always efficient and friendly.  Their prices are very reasonable and their menu is pretty extensive for a pub type establishment.  No matter if you are regular or a first timer, you will be made to feel welcome and leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Last night, a few friends and I came to Mulligan's to enjoy some beers, shots and food.  I've never been to Mulligan's, however, once I heard that this place was right down the road from me, I was totally on board.    The place is super dark and has a section for dining and a section for the bar.  There are signs all over and pub style decor.  Remember when you come here, you are NOT allowed to say the F bomb.  If you continue saying that word, you will get kicked out.  I don't know why, but it's a rule they have.  Last night we got the chicken nachos, chicken quesadilla and the spinach and artichoke dip.  The food overall is pub food and good when you had a few drinks down.  Isn't really something I would choose to eat all the time, but it works.  I think I had an overall great experience with the staff and my friends, which made me give a higher than normal rating.  I wouldn't mind coming back if my friends ever chose this place again."}
{"text":"Can't remember the young lane who helped me the other day, but she was amazing and very friendly. Had to wait for the card machine to work and instead of standing there, she took the time to have a conversation and joke with me. Food was amazing and on point. Lived here for 2 years and wish I had gone in more often"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch, needed to get some work done and brought my laptop into the restaurant. The server came up and first thing she said was laptops and tablets are not allowed. Wtf? I've NEVER heard that before. But anyways, great way to alienate the business working class. I left immediately and will never be back."}
{"text":"I really do like this place, the staff is friendly, the food is good, and there are machines to gamble at the bar which that's everywhere in Vegas lol. Over all a pretty good place to just relax, gamble, have some drinks and eat a little pub food. Their black and bleu burger is delicious."}
{"text":"First of all. Don't speak to me with an attitude. If you hate your job. GO FIND ANOTHER ONE! The bartenders are are meh at best. And for Mulligan's policy not using derogatory words in their bar is straight bs. It's a BAR for Christ sakes. Give a kit kat or snickers because that would've made me have a better time. My first & ONLY time being a patron here. Overall experience WACK!!!"}
{"text":"Had Corn Beef and Cabbage here today, St. Patrick's Day 2018! It was very good, not perfect but still good. Service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you're hit with the smell of smoke. If you're a smoker it probably won't bother you, but it was very off putting right away for me. It made me lose part of my appetite.   My group shared Mozzarella cheese sticks as an appetizer and they were OK. Most of the group got burgers and they were great. The meat was seasoned really well and had awesome flavor. Fries were nice and crispy too."}
{"text":"After my visit to the other Mulligan's on Pebble, I had driven by this one on my way home from work several times. Since it was St. Paddy's Day, what better than to stop in, enjoy a green beer, corned beef and cabbage, and watch some NCAA March Madness BB.  They have a pretty large menu for a bar. They also run some good drink specials, ie 16 oz Guinness for $4, Irish Car Bomb for $6. I'm not sure what there normal specials are, since this was a special day.  I ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage special meal, $15. Out came a huge plate loaded with Irish goodness. The Corned Beef was tender, and flavorful. So far my two meals at Mulligan Pubs have been very good.   The bar itself is square, with plenty of gaming spots, and a 6 seat section of non-gaming spots. The dining area is separated by glass, so non-smokers can enjoy their meal. The air conditioning/air exchange felt pretty strong, I never noticed the bar area being too smoky.  Service was on point. Friendly, welcoming, and both bartenders worked together as a team to check on patrons. Great job!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We came here after a soccer tournament to watch the clasico Real Madrid vs. Barcelona. We were seated in the family area bc a few of our friends had their kids with them. Apparently, we were too loud bc the \"manager\" came out and asked us to keep it down bc we were \"too loud\" & she could hear us in her office?! Wtf?!?!?? Really?!?!!? It's a BAR!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this bar. If I have to be honest, though, I'm not sure I would have stopped by the place if I were just randomly driving by cause it seems a bit sketchy from the outside, but since it's right next door to the in-laws, the wife and I grab a few cold ones before heading into the madness.  The beer is great, Meghan and Andy are da bizness, and the place has a pretty chill vibe. You can tell the staff gets along with each other by their kwerky and sarcastic sense of humor; just the way I like it.   I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up."}
{"text":"Had a fun day of caddying for my buddy in the US Open pre qualifier at South Shore. On our way home, we were hungry and craved a good beer, so we figured Mulligans would be a convenient stop. It looks ok when you walk in, clean, typical gaming pub and restaurant. We ordered a Stella off tap which was ice cold and refreshing in a frosty mug. After ordering food we were waiting, gambling and discussing our golf round. My friend said, \"Fuck, I can't believe I missed that putt!\" That is when the old lady bartender, Said \"Excuse me, but we don't use that kind of language here\" \"Our gaming clientele is older, respectable, and the owner doesn't allow swearing.\" I thought she was joking, but the machine dealt me 4 to the royal for the 4th time and I said \"Fuckin A!!!!\" \"Fuck Me!!!!\" and she came back and reminded me in a calm way, \"No Swearing please, It is really a rule here.\" Soon our Southwest Philly cheese steak sandwiches came out with fries, they were average at best but hot and fresh, lacking any substantial flavor but edible. But the old lady scolding me for language in an empty bar playing shitty old music left such a bad taste in my mouth that we left immediately after eating and will never consider going back. WTF? If you are gonna have freedom of speech censorship rules, please post on front door, so non conservative freaks know to turn around and not waste money in this boring, lame, establishment."}
