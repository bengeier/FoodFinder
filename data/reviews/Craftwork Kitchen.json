{"text":"2 Band Experiences at this Restaurant:

1. Hair in my Turkey Gyro
2. A Year Later, no Turkey in my Turkey Gryo

Its a shame the food is tasty but after these 2 bad experiences i won't be spending my lunch here anymore!"}
{"text":"Just had my last bbq chicken tacos of the season and I'm really going to miss these guys.  Craftwork catering set up shop in a stand in the US Steel Plaza on Grant Street at the beginning of the summer and I quickly became addicted to the 2 for $5 taco lunch.  They grill 'em in their bbq sauce right in front of you, put them in a little flour tortilla of perfect thickness and top off with some fresh cilantro, tomatoes,  queso fresco, and either stop there or you can add some of their mouthwatering Pineapple salsa yourself. 

They  have a ton of other options like quesadillas, bahn mi and sandwich style, and all for a great price.  They also had portobella, mahi-mahi, shrimp, carnitas and brisket as options for your meat, but I got hooked on the bbq chicken.  So so good.  Will be craving them til next summer. 

I definitely would use them for an event if I had one, I also think they would be a great treat for an office party. 

 I hope they open up a Taqueria soon!  A little birdy told me they might..."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and attention to detail yield delicious things here, not to mention this place is fun...a great escape from an otherwise hectic workday (even if it only lasted 15 mins)!"}
{"text":"I'm downgrading CK due to my rather pedestrian lunch today. I tried one of their suggestions which was the cheesesteak. While the basic flavors were good, the sandwich came off too clean.  Sanitary. Separate items on a bun.  The fries were good.

It was missing sauce of any type, although they said they put mayo on it. It was also completely grease free. While normally that might be a compliment, the sandwich was just overly dry. 

I much prefer Peppi's Ultra cheesesteak( or the delicious blazing saddle) or even Fernandos cheesesteak, which is a lot more food for less money.

I still think this place has potential, but not with the cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Not having ordered anything from here other than breakfast or burgers (which I highly recommend--though they're only served outside in the summer), I treated myself to the \"Porkgasm\" sandwich today.  I was disappointed when my sandwich was handed to me, as it felt a bit lighter than the sandwiches I get elsewhere.  However, when I got back to my desk and had my Porkgasm--er, ate my Porkgasm sandwich--I was more than okay with trading volume for quality.  It was a delicious sandwich and I'll be back to sample the rest of the menu.

UPDATE:  Craftwork started grilling tacos outside recently and these are also AWESOME.  I'm a taco traditionalist, but I enjoy the hell out of the Pescado Baja (Mahi Mahi) tacos as well as the Carne Asada (steak) and Pollo Tradicional (chicken).  Yes, these tacos are pricier than the Qdoba variety, but also much, much better."}
{"text":"Let me first say I will try this place again because they have pride in what they create.  They are culinary artist, not cooks and it shows in the menu.  I will always give a place a second and third try if the passion shows and here it does.  Unfortunately, my meal was not as outstanding as I hoped, but still better than most.

The chicken noodle soup was average, but in Pittsburgh we are spoiled (and I hate to admit it) with Eat n Park's chicken noodle.

My chicken wrap cam with lettuce, lime aoli, bacon, and bbq sauce.  It was good, but the BBQ sauce either didn't fit with the rest or was missing that spicy tang I like in BBQ sauces.

Thought the prices were slighly high for what you got."}
{"text":"Hidden in the underground tunnel below the USX Steel Tower, this little place dishes out a funky vibe to go along with the sandwiches and wraps they create.

Breakfast provides several great burrito and sandwich options. Lunch sandwiches are all different and good.

Today I had the chicken sandwich and a side of Mac and Cheese. I added some Buffalo Chicken to the Mac for an extra $2. I have also had the \"Porkgasm\" sandwich before which was also good.

There is always fun music playing out of this place that goes along great with the playful, upbeat atmosphere and the staff. In the summer months they also have a tent outside USX Tower serving mostly tacos."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich for lunch which was pretty good, more sweet than tangy and served on a sub roll. The sub roll it was served on was good and toppings were tasty.  I failed to order fries with my sandwich, I sort of thought they were included but I was wrong.  My bad, I failed.  The guy behind the counter realized this and threw me a box of fries for free, very cool.  The fries were really good, not typical pedestrian style fries.  These were really good fries. I will be back to this place and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I think at one point I was eating breakfast and lunch at Craftwork two to three times a week.  Not the easiest thing for my wallet ... but my belly sure enjoyed all the amazing food.  This particular offering is located in the basement of the US Steel Tower along with Istanbul Grille, a pizza place, and Au Bon Poo.  Aside from the days where I venture out of the Tower, Craftwork is pretty much my default lunch option.  Two mains reasons:  first the people, they're all awesome.  And second, the value.  You get GREAT food and it is in line with all the other offerings in that category around the area.  My favorite has to be the Pinkman.  A chicken wrap with cheese, barbecue sauce, and bacon.

ps:  quite possibly the best fries in town."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch several times now and it does not disappoint.  They offer wraps and sandwiches for breakfast that cost maybe slightly more than some of the chains downtown, but it's simple, fresh food that tastes really good.  Lunch is even better.  Some of the sandwiches are pretty good, but I tried a Pinkman wrap and was amazed! The grilled chicken in the wrap was fresh and cooked perfectly, and the BBQ sauce and chili lime aioli gave it so much flavor. Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"Great and fun lunch place. We went there this week and got some Porkasms and a Barbeque shrimp sandwich. Yumm - daring but good flavor combinations. Great people working there - friendly, funny and quick. Don't mind the free lollipops they throw in your to-go bag :) We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came back for a breakfast sandwich and it was AMAZING.  The bacon was super crispy and the bread was light.  They also use real eggs, which you don't always get downtown.  Breakfast sandwich rating earns you an additional star!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat in the Steel building.  The service is always fast and the people working here are very friendly and seem to have a lot of fun while working together.

The breakfast sandwiches are all very good and made fresh.  For lunch, my favorite is either the Buffalo shrimp wrap or the steak and blue sandwich (I sub ranch for the blue cheese).  Every sandwich I have tried has always been great.  The fresh cut fries are a perfect compliment to the large sandwiches.  They have a station where you can add vinegar and Cajun seasoning which I would recommend.  They also have great ranch dressing that goes well with the fries.

It is a little pricy, however the portions are huge.  You could split a sandwich and fries with another person and be full.  If you eat a full sandwich and fries by yourself, you will be sleeping the rest of your work day."}
{"text":"Dear Craft Work,
   Thank you for ruining my entire life. I just purchased a breakfast wrap from your establishment called \"old school.\"  This wrap was so delicious that I now know that I will be forced to eat this wrap every morning for the rest of my natural life. In fact, I have decided to start taking the T to work just so I can swing by every morning with ease and pick up one of these tastastic breakfast bonanzas. This wrap is all I can think about and I have billable hours so this is now a huge problem. I have to go now before I get fired and can no longer afford this mouth treat."}
{"text":"Working in the Steel building, there are some sad options to choose from at lunch time. Luckily, Craft Work is one of two options (the other being Istanbul grille) that satiate the hungry without having to eat overpriced chain fast food. 

Everything I have eaten here has been great. My favorite, by far, is the porkgasm sandwich. Pulled pork, cheddar, pickles, chipotle mayo and barbecue sauce. This sandwich is a go-to when I'm having a bad day that can only be made better with food. The breakfast sandwiches and burritos are fresh and delicious every time. They also serve coffee which is great if you're not a fan of Starbucks like myself."}
{"text":"Pretty ordinary bland-ish food, for too much money. 
The chicken Philly was disappointing and the wraps weren't any better.
The trouble is the rest of the independent restaurants in USX aren't a lot cheaper. 
My suggestion is that your money is better spent somewhere else if you are willing to walk out off the USX building in bad weather."}
{"text":"I used these guys for box lunches for a meeting with a VIP customer. Service was very personal and top notch. The owner delivered the lunch himself and right on time - even though I was a little vague on the exact address. The people raved about the taste, quality, quantity and variety. Craftwork has a new customer for life. 

Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"We recently had our Board of Director's lunch catered by Craftwork Kitchen. Among the items we ordered were delicious subs filled with high quality meats, fresh tortellini salad (which we are still enjoying), and unbelievably addictive, home-made potato chips.  The price was very fair, delivery was on time, and all the needed utensils were there - no mistakes. We will order from Craftwork again."}
{"text":"I work in the USX tower, love having the old school for breakfast. Tacos are great in the summer, nachos are good too. The staff is very friendly and fun too."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to eat for lunch one day.  I didn't want any more pizza.  (We had a pizza party at work and they sent us home with leftover pizza.)  I also didn't want to eat a salad or anything remotely healthy that day.  So I wandered down to the Craftwork Kitchen spot under the USX tower.  A friend of mine recommended that I try almost any sandwich.  By the way, I'm a sucker for fresh-cut fries and when I saw that those were available, I thought that this might be the ticket.

When I stepped up to the counter, I didn't expect mad jokes all around from the dudes there.  I like humor with my food.  They were friendly and very excited about the food that they were serving. How many restaurateurs do you meet that have that level of enthusiasm?

I was in the mood for shrimp and they were in the mood to make me a Shrimp Po Boy.  I added some fresh-cut fries (I did say that I love fresh-cut fries) and I was ready to chow down.  I received my food quickly and trotted back to my desk for a feast.  Let me say this, the food was fresh tasting and you could tell that it was homemade.  I appreciate that. (So many restaurants open a jar of Marzettis and pour out whatever they offer.  Nothing against Marzettis,  I'm just saying to try making something from scratch)  The shrimp had a good flavor, the bread was dang tasty and the fries were scrumptious!  What's not to like?

Since my initial trip, I have also tried their amazballs tacos and homemade watermelon \"juice\"?  Mouthwatering all around!"}
{"text":"Lunch decisions are often difficult in the US Steel Tower. If you work or have ever worked there, you understand the difficulty of getting anywhere at lunch time. With people everywhere and long waits for elevators, the lunch hour is basically over by the time you get your food if you choose to eat anywhere in the building. 

That being said, Craftwork is worth the wait and the lines! Their staff is fast and they do a good job of keeping the line moving and turning orders out in just a few minutes.

I have tried a number of items here and everything has been fresh and full of flavor. My current favorite is the buffalo chicken sandwich. Instead of the usual fried slab of chicken drenched in buffalo sauce, their version is filled with chicken that has been shredded and coated in sauce. The sauce itself is spicy and has a little more flavor to it than your typical wing sauce. If you're a buffalo chicken lover, this won't disappoint.

They also make amazing fries! The sandwiches are big, but you need these fries so find someone to split an order with or just get them on Friday (because it doesn't count on Fridays, duh). You can get them just about any way you want, as far as sauces go, but I recommend getting a side of the chipotle mayo. It's creamy and spicy and will make even the worst of days right.

It can get a little pricey, but that seems to be the case with just about every establishment in USX. I would still much rather support an independent option than one of the equally expensive chains in the building."}
{"text":"$9 for a chicken salad that consists of bagged salad, maybe two pieces of cucumber and chicken that has a gamey taste. You'd think I would learn after three times but not so much. I'm told the sandwiches are delicious. Not sure I'm willing to try. This is one of a few places located on the very bottom floor of the USX Tower there to serve lunch to the thousands working in the building. So I'm guessing it's easy to sell overpriced grocery store bagged lettuce to us."}
{"text":"I've never had a single hint of a problem with these guys (and gals). The food is always delicious, the fries are amazing, the prices are reasonable for the area, and everything works together like a charm.

I typically go with the Porkgasm, the Pinkman, The Sloppy Top, or the PGH Cheesesteak, but all their salads and other options are delicious as well. If you're looking for great food served with a laid-back, yet obviously attentive attitude, hit this place up.

Not to mention, they have a healthy respect for all things Lionel Richie, which can only be a bonus in my book."}
