{"text":"I came here completely by accident when I detoured to avoid construction traffic during my dinner break from work. It was busy, but I was seated very quickly and service seemed prompt. They have a good selection of decent food. I have never had sushi in a buffet setting before, and I have to say it was actually slightly better than I expected. That said, I wasn't expecting much. They offered a few varieties of rolls and nigiri, though I definitely wouldn't come here if I was craving a meal consisting solely of sushi. The wide variety of seafood and asian food more than sufficed to fill this void, and though I am not convinced I will go back, I certainly did not regret going or spending the $12 or so I spent to eat."}
{"text":"Don't see what all the fuss is about. I have had better Chinese food after I nuked a frozen selection in the microwave. As for the Mongolian BBQ - small selection, can't make your own sauce, and still bland. If you eat supermarket sushi, then this is the place for you. If you like fresh sushi, then leave immediately. I can sum up my review in one word, NASTY!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is much better than the location on Ray Road. It's a pretty big standalone building near Chandler mall area, and has some nice exterior decoration to look quite \"Chinese\".  Interior design was alright, nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely more presentable than other buffets in the valley.  I was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of the food they had. For a chinese buffet, they really put a lot of thought into the dishes they made, and not just stick with the trademark cheap chinese buffet dishes like sweet and sour pork.  The stuffed scallops, sashimi, squids were the highlights in my opinion. Flavoring was excellent and they kept their food fresh and warm at all times.  I hope this place holds up as it is in a great location and have a very big building. Price is very reasonable too, great value!  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok- I am not sure where these people went, but it could not possibly be the Royal Buffet I just went to at 2530 W. Chandler Blvd.  Service was okay, but the food....one word- YUCK.  I cannot imagine the doors to that place will be open for long.  Too bad for the nice people that work there, but it is a really bad buffet."}
{"text":"I ate here last night.. The sushi part of the buffet (my favorite) was above average, the hot food was about average for a good Chinese buffet. Fresh oysters on the half shell and two plates of sushi made me full and happy. Service was very good while I was here, never had any trouble keeping my drink full.  I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Well opening day and Robyn N. , Rand H. and myself are here for lunch. The place is big and comfy and well over 100 food choices, Everything i tried here was very good . It has all your typical Chinese buffet items and a whole lot more .  All these new super Chinese buffets keep getting better and better and this one is right up there with the best of them. So I will give this one five stars and a big YUMMM"}
{"text":"Food was overly salty, greasy, and most dishes were barely warm. Only point given for decor and music selection."}
{"text":"Hi there!!!!......I went with 2 co-workers of mine, Joyce and Maria. We had a great time! the food was delicious and the sushi was fresh! They have many options to choose from and the price was very reasonable (7.00 to 9.00 for lunch) The place looked very clean and the staff was very courteous. A good place to have lunch with a large group! I'm looking forward to my next visit! Yummy!!!!    xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with Rand H and Mike C just as they were opening for the very first time.  I am far from being a buffet expert, but this was nothing like the Chinese buffets I had been to back in Chicago.  As Rand said, there were over 130 items, including a Mongolian BBQ, a sushi bar, as well as a good variety of Chinese and American foods.  Everything I tasted was excellent with good flavor and high quality.  There is something for everyone here and at 7.95 for a lunch time buffet, it's definitely a bargain.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good selection of food. Good price.. Lots of crab legs. Lots of sushi, which is ok, but its on ice so the rice gets cold.   My major beef was that none of the desserts were labeled.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"I went to Royal Buffet for lunch. The food was not that delicious, and it had small selection of food. The reason I gave two stars is really because I have better experience somewhere else."}
{"text":"Finally a big Chinese buffet that's good!!  A buddy and myself checked this place out last week and I couldn't be more happier.  Well I could, but I was very satisfied..  They had a huge assortment of foods from all your popular Chinese dishes to even a couple American ones.  Buffalo wings..! yum.  They even have a BBQ station.  I wasn't too impressed with it, so passed it up, but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out.    Would i go back? Oh heck yeah.  Very good food and service!"}
{"text":"Like Bruce before me, I was going to mention that the Royal Buffet had taken the place of the Derby Diner before it.  I don't think that the Royal Buffet will supplant the China King down the street, as the Royal Buffet is smaller (a lot smaller, actually), but it definitely can serve a purpose - mostly because it is a well-tended buffet, and unlike the China King, you get fresh sushi rather than the mass-market variety from the China King.  The selection on the buffet itself isn't outstanding, and nothing really sets it apart from any other buffet (if in the area and looking for a buffet, I'd probably go to the Dragon House on Woodlawn), but it's not bad, and it does appear to be kept fresh - or at least it was during the time that we were there.  Most of the dishes are pretty standard meat and vegetable variety, and service is good."}
{"text":"I prefer Pasific Buffet! Trust me! The food was ok. Nothing special. Most of the food cooked quite dry. No such of alot variety. I give 3 stars because its just ok."}
{"text":"The is four buffet stars. I hold buffets to a lower standard. I'd say it is three regular restaurant stars.   This place is a cut above the average Chinese buffet. I'd say it is a step below Hong Kong Buffet in Ahwatukee, but cheaper. It is at least three steps above the buffets surrounding my house in Tempe, and not too much more expensive. They recently lowered their dinner price to $10.95--our two drinks plus hot tea was only $2 and our three year old ate for free--or maybe I should say he played with his food for free. Total bill for three of us--$26 and change plus tip.   Lots of seafood (for my wife) including crab and crawfish, but still lots of other stuff (for me), and enough unusual dishes to be interesting., It is a nice looking place, very clean. According to the notice near the front door, they applied for a liquor license, so maybe beer and wine will be coming soon. Service was very good indeed--plenty of refills. They also have one of the better sushi selections I have seen in a buffet, and a now-typical Mongolian BBQ area, only with more stuff than most I see.   In all, this is one of the better Chinese buffets I have visited."}
{"text":"This place is not friendly! The waiters stood in the corner playing themselves and got mad when I asked for a refill after waiting 30mins! Wtf??? The food also sits out there if no one is getting any when it should be swapping out every 30-40mins reguardless of how slow it is! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!"}
{"text":"This Chinese buffet opened in what used to be the Derby Diner, in the Costco shopping center on Tyvola. It's barely a mile from the long-standing \"Super Buffet\" a little further west, so I'm not sure why there is a need for two so close to each other.  The Royal Buffet has the usual standard chicken beef and pork dishses on the steam table. It seemed like they were a little lacking during my visit - the chicken teriyaki tasted like simple grilled chicken. Aside from being well charred, it had no flavor. The chicken and brocolli was drowning in sauce. Something labeled \"pork chop\" was large slices of, I assume, pork mixed with vegetables. The highlight of the tables was the full size ribs, which were meaty and delicious.  There is also a separate area for sushi. Most of the time, the sushi at a Chinese buffet is sort of an after thought. Not so here. This is a mini-sushi bar with several different rolls and salmon, shrimp, crab stick and other nigiris. There is also a sign posted that they will make several different sushi items to order at no extra charge. I made two visits for these fresh rolls and was stuffed.  My glass of water was refilled often. The restaurant looked clean and the staff checked the condition of the buffet table on a regular basis.  Overall, I was pleased with the Royal Buffet. I would recommend the sushi more - for $12 including soda and tip, a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"This place is closed.  The food was average at best and the service was poor.  No wonder they closed."}
