{"text":"If you're into dive bars you'll love this place.   It might look like it needs some updating, but hey every one needs a local dive bar and this place is fantastic!!  It's a great local hang out in the hood.   The food is great and the server Dora is awesome - great customer service.   

Check out Karaoke night!!"}
{"text":"Horrible.

A group of friends and I went to get a couple drinks at the wally. When we got out drinks I accidentally hit my arm on the beer and spilt it all over the place. The waitress told me I was cut off even though I was completely sober. Then she proceeded to tell me if I want more drinks to go to the bar and not ask her. 

There nachos were stale also."}
{"text":"Been coming to Half-time/Wally for over 17 years and have only had the Wings/fries. 95% of the time they're on point. Rare to get  bad batch of Wings (however, I have had a batch or two over the years). Only drink bottle beer here (avg selection). Dora's a machine when she's running the floor on her own. Tuesday/Thursday Half price wings -bang for your buck = best wings"}
{"text":"Complete dive bar. Totally unprofessional staff. The owner is overly aggressive to anyone who's not a regular. It's one of those dingy bars with wood paneling, old drunks and a feisty  barmaid. There is always drunk idiots coming out of here at all hours because the staff allow them to drink far past what would be acceptable at a respectable establishment. If the visual appearance of the outside isn't off putting enough, just take a step inside and be greeted by a depressed looking middle aged woman who's almost unhappy youre there- Dora. I would not waste my time with this place. It's best to have a basic grasp of customer service before you dive right into running a bar."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly unimpressed with this dive. I went to watch a highly anticipated UFC event here recently and phoned in advance to make a reservation. I spoke with the owner Dora, who must've seen my name on caller ID as she addressed me personally by first name. I was impressed at her friendly manner, and she ensured me that I would indeed have a table to watch...even though they were going fast. 

Humbled and thrilled, we made our way to the bar. Upon entry, we were asked if we were there to watch the fights but weren't asked about our reservation. No matter, we were ushered to a table with a decent view of televisions. On to ordering...I ordered a pint of an Irish ale which I am very familiar with. However, it tasted off-- as if it was stale or the keg had been sitting too long. I tried to enjoy it but simply couldn't. Not wanting to be \"that persnickety person,\" I finally gave in and approached the bar hoping that perhaps I could be given another pint. Well, I was met with insolent attitude from the same Dora who took my phone reservation. She belligerently told me that there was nothing wrong with it (I am a former bartender myself, so I know what a dodgy pint tastes like) and told me that there was a \"regular\" beside me who drinks it all of the time. To add insult to injury, she gave him a sample and asked him if it tasted normal. Of course he said that it did...although I question the accuracy of his taste buds given his near state of intoxication. Experiment complete, Dora snidely said \"see? I told you\" to which I curtly replied \"clearly, my taste must be off.\"

I returned to my seat to be blasted by a cacophony of karaoke music and caterwauling which made it impossible to hear the UFC feed. Needless to say, after my excursion to the bar, our service was pretty much non-existent, and I had to all but step in front of the server to order anything. I then ordered another pint of Belgian Moon which is my usual beverage of choice (I'd had one only hours before), and it also tasted abysmal. It was flat and tasted as if the line hadn't been cleaned in a long while, if not ever. 

If that wasn't enough, I asked if because we had made a reservation, could we be moved into the separate room where UFC was being broadcast without the background \"din\" of Saturday night karaoke. The server took an eternity to inquire, and wonders never cease, she came back only to tell us that Dora didn't have our reservation. I'm sure it was lost immediately after I questioned our proprietress about the dodgy pints I was served. 

In all, this has got to be one of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a tavern (I won't even dignify this hole in the wall with description as a pub). I rarely think that my opinion or posts really matter, but if you are contemplating coming to this establishment, promptly find somewhere else and save yourself the grief. You'll be better off anywhere else!"}
{"text":"The Wally is not far from where we live, so we decided to check it out. It's pretty much like any tap and grill, both interior and exterior. However when we entered, we weren't seated (which is fine of course) so we found a seat near some servers (none of which acknowledged us), instead they all just chatted with each other. We sat waiting for 20 mins or so before a server checked on us. We asked for a menu, she disappeared to get one and never came back. I saw her minutes later chatting again.

The woman behind the bar actually had attempted to help us after 30 mins of waiting. By then we decided it was best if we left the staff to their conversations.

Too bad."}
{"text":"The only reason I have it a one star is because they had beer and that was it's only redeeming quality. The food was awful...we didn't even finish our meals. There were what I would assume were regulars there because they knew all the servers, that were extremely loud and obnoxious. We could barely hear out conversation over their yelling back and forth. Would've been nice to sit on the patio, but all the smokers were on it. The place is pretty gross. If you want to stop for a quick beer it's ok, nothing more."}
{"text":"I'm a local and I love this place. 

Dora, the owner and bartender, is the most bad ass woman you'll ever meet. She makes a mean amaretto sour. I've never had anyone I know have any complaints about the drinks. There's also a wide variety of beers on tap. 

Friday and Saturdays are karaoke nights. It's a good time, but on occasion it can be busy so don't expect to sing your life away! 

There are tv's everywhere so for a sports fan it's a great place! There's also a pool table and foosball table. 

As for food, I'm picky. So I've tried a little amount of things on the menu. The chicken Caesar wrap is the best one I've ever tasted. Chicken wings are your average bar chicken wings. (Thursday and Tuesday are wing nights but I don't know the deal). Nachoes are good but there's tons of lettuce on them. (Id rather more than less). French fries are great. Chicken club, penne, and chicken fingers are both pretty good too. My family cannot boost more about the Mediterranean burger. Also heard fajitas are amazing. (Saturday is fajita night)

Since its a bar and grill I've been coming here since I was 12. I love it."}
{"text":"This bar is barely mediocre. They blare horrible karaoke so you can't hear yourself think. I had a similar experience to Katie, after having one drink I was \"cut off\" and because I was cut off so we're the 2 other people at my table. When I tried to talk to the waitress about why she just said go up the bar. So I did for the rest of the evening. I think that was her way of getting out of doing work."}
{"text":"Two words. Character.  I give the Wally 4 stars not because it's an awesome bar, but because it is what it is. A straight ahead drinkin' and eating wings-while-you-watch a game kind of place. Service is unique and friendly if you are friendly, probably pretty bad if you are a snob.  If you are a foodie, this is not the place for you. If you want pretty good wings in an environment where you can say. Oh yea, that's what bars were like in the 80s, this is your spot. Love it for what it is. 

I even bring my kids here for wing night sometimes because they don't get to play pool and fooze ball in most places we can have a meal."}
{"text":"I went to check out the karaoke as it's relatively close to home. The exterior is plain. The interior is a typical local bar but it is huge. A lot more space than pretty much any other local bar I've seen. Above the bar there are three or four televisions on different channels so if you're into sports I'm sure they can give you what you need. There is a nice patio but it was covered in snow, maybe check it out in the summer. The drinks are slightly over priced for the area. I was charged $14 for two pints. Across the street I can get a pint for like $5.50. The bartender wasn't friendly at all but she did laugh and smile at other people sometimes leading me to believe she's a good person just having a bad day. I'd heard raves about the sound quality of the karaoke show. They were lies. It wasn't amazing. There was a large selection of songs. Every person will sing what I call an \"old man song\". Not like quality older songs we all know and love but like self-indulgent nonsense that you've either never heard or don't care about. I stayed about an hour and a half but it wasn't my scene. Leaving here is ridiculous. The bus to the subway stops at 10:30 on Fridays for some stupid reason and good luck seeing a taxi. I'll probably give it another shot in the summer but for now I'm still thawing out from the walk home."}
{"text":"I have frequented this establishment many a night.
The wings I find are on par with any of the other so called \"best wing\" locales.  The staff are super friendly and the beer is cold and filled as fast as you consume it.  
Thursday nites have specials for wings and pints.  
The place is nothing to look at when you walk in but don't let that fool you.
It is first class all the way with food and drink and people."}
{"text":"We almost passed up this place because it really does look dodgy on the outside. Checked out the other Yelp reviews and decided to take a chance. Had the Caribbean Jerk wings, Chicken Souvlaki dinner and the Mushroom Swiss Burger with fries. EVERYTHING was good! As a previous reviewer noted, the fries and wings are great. I doubt I'll be in this neighborhood again as we were only around here to head to the Science Center, but if I was I'd come back here."}
{"text":"Dora really knows how to take care of her customers! She's as much a part of the place as their famous wings! A great place for groups,  a quick bite, or a cold one while you watch the game!"}
{"text":"Terrible place for UFC fans! They have a karaoke running during the fights and you can't hear anything from the UFC. Also if it is a hockey night they favour that instead of UFC and lastly but not least they don't show the prelim fights..."}
{"text":"looks like a dive on the outside but on the inside its not as bad as you would think, both divey and the not divey crowd should feel ok here. Nice patio and good inside complete with arcade games, foosball and pooltable, lots of different seating (bars, tables, booths) big place and lots of TV's I saw the leaders debate here a few days ago and I'm sure it is a fun place during large sports games, like the leaders debate.

I only ate the nachos and wings. The nachos were surprisingly good. Often nachos at pubs are annoying due to the toppings not being stuck to the chips, or the chips being stuck to the plate but niether of those annoyances were present at the wally. 

Unfortunately though the wings had some room to be desired. They were sort of dry and a little too toasty (not burnt) tasting on the outside, although the inside was nice and moist and the flavor was ok, but something bothered me about them. Fries were very tasty.

They seem to take pride in their (mostly tropically themed) cocktails, their beers are not on the menu though, I hate this. When I asked what was on tap the waitress quickly listed off about 15 beers in 7 seconds my response was \"uh.. stella?\"

They have an Amsterdam sign on the door but no Amsterdam on tap, this made me mad.

good bar if you want an average experience with some decent pub grub and a nice place to watch the game. Lots of room for all your buddies. I would come here again."}
{"text":"They have beer. They also have an intriguing sports bar area set up. There is a decent sized flatscreen, with too large speakers, so you can actually hear the game.

My group was less than impressed with the appetizers, specifically 1) calamari and 2) jalapeno poppers. There were only about 4 poppers, surrounded by a bunch of stale tortilla chips.

I would certainly consider returning for a game or UFC night if I was in the area. I'm guessing it's a 3 or 4 star for that specific situation"}
{"text":"I've seen this place for decades so I finally tried it for a big Blue Jays game today!!

Friendly staff and patrons!

Excellent Caesar salad***( lemon and fresh!!)

Quite good BBQ Chicken sandwich!

But the place is actually pretty nice inside!! Attractive rooms and washrooms."}
{"text":"Try the tsunami wings for a fairly accurate reenactment of one of nature's deadliest forces contained right in your very own large intestine. Much like coastal Japan my insides were ravaged over and over by waves of Pacific fury. I had no choice but to evacuate."}
